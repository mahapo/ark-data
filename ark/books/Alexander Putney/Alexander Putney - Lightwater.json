Having no one to influence my outlook, I display my primordial nature and adopt the style of a youthful prince. This is due to the only father guru. I am busy working for others. Prajna, penetrating all obstacles, has made the prince old and wise, fearing no one. Dancing in space, clad in clouds, eating the sun and holding the moon, the stars are my retinue. The naked child is beautiful and dignified. The red flower blooms in the sky. It is ironic to see the formless dancer, dancing to the trumpet without a trumpeter. At the palace of red ruby, listening to the utterance of the seed syllable, it is joyful to watch the dance of illusion, the seductive maidens of phenomena. The warrior without a sword, riding on a rainbow, hears the limitless laughter of transcendent joy, the poisonous snake becomes amrita. Drinking fire, wearing water, holding the mace of the wind, breathing earth, I am the lord of the three worlds.

Solar plasma formations during coronal mass ejections display perpendicular rows of luminous plasma plumes (opposite) that are also observed of Earth’s noctilucent aurora (above). Auroral plumes were photographed and videotaped in the high atmosphere above Xiamen, China on July 12, 2010 as uneven rows of vertical plasma beams shone brightly during the night hours. 1 Perhaps the most striking examples of aerial plasma formations have been recorded near ground level in Longview, Texas by motion -activated game -trail cameras on the n ight of September 9 -10, 2009. 2 The auspicious calendar date of this plasma flare event –9/9/9– suggests that heightened Earth resonance and solar activity may be directly linked with synchronized meditation by large masses of human beings, as once achieved by the pyramid -building cultures of the world, whose resonant temple stones still hum today."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 3 Sacred geometric knowledge of the focal points of Earth resonance remains perfectly preserved in the pyramidal monuments of the world, both in their respective structural configurations and their relative geopositions, encoding the golden proportion as a precise spherical formula [ z n+1 = z n 2 ].

The hemispheric design of the topknot bun at the crown chakra displays octopolar symmetry with sets of concentric circles arranged in radial rows of 4, 8 and 16. The extremely long earlobes often seen in representations of the Buddha reflect an odd Sanskrit cultural ass ociation with transcendent wisdom and the great attainment of yogis to become transdimensional beings, at one with Creation. The identification of spiritual attainment with gold has been passed down since time immemorial, and the latest findings of the bi ophysical sciences provide access to deeper layers of meaning within these ever -present cultural concepts. Gold, like silver, is not reactive with water and so does not break down by oxidation, but maintains a pure state –just as the consciousness of a ful ly self -aware human being is crystallized and purified to achieve the highest state of perfection attainable. Sacred mountains are identified by indigenous cultures for the alignment of their peaks with convergence points of infrasound resonance, while gr eat masters of consciousness are known to reside on such sacred peaks. Among the Himalayan spiritual traditions of India and Nepal, the mystical figure Mahavatar Babaji is closely associated with a cavesite retreat within sacred Mt. Kailash. Other p oignant examples include the Indian adept Sri Ramana, who practiced a barefoot yogic lifestyle atop sacred Mt. Arunachala thriving on the accumulated spiritual energy for most of his life, This resonant bioenergetic phenomenon is well cited among ancient wisdom traditions as an attainment of spiritual and physical purity, as the water of the adept’s body itself becomes crystallized by the deep delta wave beating that reigns over the enlightened consciousness. Such resonant bodies never desiccate atop sacred moun tain peaks, or inside pyramid chambers, but become mummified in the preservative infrasound- enhanced electromagnetic environment as the piezoelectric crystalline water, bones and tissues are continually sterilized by mild electrical currents that neutraliz e all pathogens. 4 This post -mortem effect was reported of spiritual adept Simeon Toko, who died in Luanda, Angola, yet his lifeless body was observed by respectful masses for many day s without any sign of putrefaction. 5 "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 5 The three main pyramids that dominat e the Giza plateau were created as a symbolic representation of the three belt stars of the Orion constellation, so designed to transduce the diverse ambient energies of both solar and geomagnetic storms into a precisely ordered tri -frequency resonance. Any t hree acoustic frequencies in Fibonacci ratio generate the full set of nonlinear standing waves that couple energy from Earth’s base Schumann Resonance frequencies (near the human heartbeat at rest) into the higher harmonics, 6 which then become audible t o the human ear as a deep pulsation –the cosmic Om. Infrasound standing waves stimulated by 1.45 Hz heartbeat booming within the Great Pyramid ignite the very water vapor surrounding the pyramids in arcs of HHO plasma that is generated as water molecu les are torn apart and ionized. Gold and silver nanoparticles were a key component of the high purity water that once rose as vapor through the pyramid’s ascending passages, to enhance the ignition process of HHO plasma within the stone chambers and into t he surrounding atmosphere. This biocompatible form of gold (thus ‘organic’) was consumed by all initiates within the pyramids, and reveals the deeper significance of the star constellation name ‘Orion’ – which literally means ‘gold ion’! Ionized nanoparticl es of gold and silver are electroluminescent, illuminating the DNA of all initiates within the pyramids: Through this initiation they will be able to see the luminosity of the Great Spirit. When this spiritual initiation is completed in the house of Hunab K'u in heaven, the spirit of each initiate will be illumined. Then, it will return to Earth to awaken the body and take it to the pyramids. Chichen Itza, Uxmal, K'aba, Etznah, Palenque, all of these sacred Mayan centers have a specific function in every part of the body to awaken the 7 powers contained in it. Only through the solar initiation can the sleeping body of mankind be awakened.

The Sanskrit origin of the world’s ancient pyramid traditions has been linguistically i dentified by modern epigrapher Dr. Kurt Schildmann, 8 yet the living culture of the Maya people of Central America remains a most direct modern link to the Vedic knowledge of the deep past, as one of several descendant language forms.

All men are made of earth, air, water, and fire... But in their hearts and in their semen, each man has his own coatl, his own serpent, the energy of Tonatiuh, the power of the sun itself. And in this serpent sleeps consciousness, in this serpent is hidden his divinity. From this serpent his wings will grow. There is an occult energy in the heart that comes from Tonatiuh, the Sun, and if man releases it, returning it consciously to the sun, he becomes immortal. But to liberate this energy, sacrifice is necessary. Man must sacrifice the desires and habits that he adores, sacrifice them in himself, and turn the knif e against the enemy that he carries within himself, that keeps his heart a prisoner. In recent times men still remembered these words, but they have now forgotten their significance. They have made enemies of other men to sacrifice them and take out their hearts, believing such offerings would propitiate Tonatiuh. Such is their degeneration, such is their superstition. When fear unites with knowledge, terrible things are done. It is the self within ourselves that we have to sacrifice. It is our own heart t hat has to be torn out of the false being and offered to the light. May Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of Fire, burn my false being. May Itzli, Obsidian Knife, liberate my heart.

Obscurity disappears as the flames rise to Tona tiuh, the purest light. Profound mathematical knowledge of the rhythms of the inner planets and their specific effect on the patterns of the collective consciousness of the human beings of Earth is followed by an explanation of the attributes of different kinds of water. Sacred waters are identified with memory, wisdom, ascension and prayer and are known to science as water molecules exclusively comprised of the lightest form of hydrogen – protium . The lower forms of water contain heavy hydrogen isotopes – deuterium and tritium (with 2 and 3 neutrons, respectively), and are associated with forgetfulness, degeneration and entropy. The Maya understand the inner power of human consciousness as a function of DNA, the coiled ‘coatl’ serpent within every living cell, to be mastered through meditation, spiritual development and emotional control of brainwave and DNA states. DNA electrification is overtly expressed in the straight, double ladders depicted on a large copper /gold plate from the Crespi collection from Cuenca, Ecuador, with double- headed serpents representing electrical currents moving along nanoparticles chains (opposite).

Three spirals are another commonly used symbolism representing the three frequencies of sound that stimulate psychoac oustic resonance within the temple chambers.

The Crystal Skull and the human being make up a single unit, but the main difference between them is that the skull has more memory than us [human beings] . When all the crystal skulls of the world get together, it will be an important moment for the human beings because the memory that has been stored in these skulls will teach us how to recall our past lives.

As it can be seen, it is a large circ le with a square in its center. Besides, the square has 328 small circles distributed symmetrically in its interior... The information below was published in the magazine \"Crop Circles\" where Judith Moore and Barbara Lamb wrote the following: “This 'Crop Cir cle' is the DNA chip that will evolve our mathematical capacity. Each one of these circles in an infinite fractal crystalline code, and each crystalline aspect is a fractal universe. This evolved system is the next step for mathematics on Earth.

The Christians speak of God, but they do not relate him to the geometric shapes.

The circle represents the movement and the square the measurement. 'The Giver of Movement and Measurement' can be found in these two crisscrossed geometric shapes; this is for the Mayas the Universal Creator... On the initiatic work of magnetic activation we will carry out with the Crystal Skulls in the Mayan temples we will use this same geometric shapes that appeared in England. In this occasion, all the initiates and teachers will experience these geometric shapes applied to the construction of the Mayan temples, but we will also have to live them cosmically. If we observe the map that we will be using in this initiation, we will realize that the ceremonial centers of the ancient Mayas were based on a geometric planning viewed from the space just as it can be appreciated... This map shows us that the Mayas built their ceremonial centers using the macro -geometry. We the initiates will use the micro- geometry when we perform our rituals to later connect it with the macro- geometry. Well, then, who will help us to expand this energy in order to achieve the activation of the pyramids? Well, that will be the role of the sacred crystal skulls because science has proved that quartz is able to expand energy much more quickly than human beings... Let me tell you that this time the flowing energy will be used only for the human beings' benefit. As we previously said, the crystal skull and the human being form a single unit.

It is also import ant to send this energy already activated to the center of each human being skull so that he can raise his consciousness. As a conclusion, we will quote an important fact related to the pyramids. It is worth mentioning here the scientific theory that t alks about the atomic excitation that takes place in the Sun, the stars and the cosmic space... that is able to penetrate all the existent things. Well, when this cosmic excitation penetrates into the pyramidal constructions, it gets organized and forms perfect geometric figures, giving birth in this to the cosmic geometric writing...

Standing auroral beams and atmospheric flashes are being caused by l ocalized surges of terrestrial infrasound at nodal convergence points, irradiating water vapor to induce the dissociation of water molecules and the rapid formation of HHO plasma. The implosion of hydrogen atoms releases intense ultraviolet -A and infrared light that becomes visible during brief periods."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 15 An intensely luminous HHO plasma canopy envelops the Giza pyramids when operating at high resonance, radiating giant acoustic plasma beams that arc from the four faces of each pyramid, with looping flares co nnecting one pyramid to another just as solar flares arc from one sunspot to another. This dramatic luminous interaction of the pyramids with stimulated atmospheric plasma activity is exactly described by the Pyramid Texts of Saqarra, Egypt (below), only now comprehensible to plasma physicists as intense emissions of UV -A and IR light from resonant HHO plasma and amplified by the gleaming UV fluorescent limestone’s of pyramids all over the world: House bright and dark of Heaven and Earth, for the [solar ] ships put together; Great Pyramid, House of the gods with pointed peak; for Heaven- to-Earth it is greatly equipped. House whose interior glows with a reddish light of Heaven, pulsating a beam which reaches far and wide; its awesomeness touches the flesh... House of Eternity; its foundations are stones, the water; its great circumference is set in the clay. 10 Calcite is an ultraviolet fluorescent material that was used extensively i n the construction of all of the pyramids of the world. The ancient Vedic accounts of antigravitic vimana, or solar ships, include recipes for electroluminescent metal alloys which display the same molecular properties as the pyramid stones, as well as showing the same octagonal axis -symmetric geometry. If antigravitic effects were once achieved in the pyramids for application to the human body and consciousness, what is the range of extra- low -frequency sound biocompatibility? The heartbeat - at 1.45 Hz wav elength of 765 feet - informs the base length of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The word 'pyr -a- mid' itself is of Greek origin, based on the word 'pyros' or fire and meaning 'fire i n the middle'. Were biocompatible plasmas once burning in the pyramids' inner chambers? The recently rediscovered high -energy state of hydrogen has been reported by Dr. Randall Mills, who has developed the process which releases vast amounts of energy sto red within the hydrogen atom itself. Mills has defined the physics underlying this novel chemical reaction derived from water as hydrino resonant- transfer plasmas, which are now being commercially marketed for power generation by his company Blacklight Power, Inc. A very similar application of this novel reaction has been developed by Denny Klein, called HHO gas, and is now available as a plasma torch capable of sublimating any material. Both of these hydrogen -based plasma reactions produce intense infrared and ultravoilet light. Interestingly, the bandwidth of UV radiation produced is restricted to UV -A, which is beneficial to the human body, while the destructive UV -B and UV- C wavelengths are not observed. The technical process by which HHO plasmas are formed has been defined by the Blacklight Power researchers. It involves the breaking of the molecular bonds of water by vaporized metal nanoparticles, producing a highly kinetic vapor composed of individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This reaction cannot occur in the presence of air, therefore a vacuum chamber is required. Once the HHO vapor fills the cham ber, it is then electrified to become HHO plasma releasing energy as the H atoms shrink to one - quarter normal size."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 16 These contemporary scientific breakthroughs shed light on the unusual experiences recounted (in Search Magazine, March 1960) by American ex-patriot Dr. Raymond Bernard in Joinville, a coastal city in the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina (above). A very strange series of extraterrestrial contacts began while Dr. Bernard was organizing and living amongst a community of vegetarians outside of the city. The calls of a booming voice from a nearby mountaintop prompted a member of Bernard's camp to investigate the location of their origin. Eventually finding only a well -like circular shaft, measured by jungle vines to be about 300' in depth, the investigator returned equipped with ample rope to descend to its bottom: When I came to the bottom I entered a tunnel, which I traversed for a distance of 2,000 meters. I then saw with my flashlight a door of stone. While I was watching the door, it sudden ly opened and I saw a very tall man with a metallic uniform, who spoke with a powerful voice and said that this was the first time that anyone ever had the courage to enter this tunnel. I first was frightened at the powerful voice of the man and wanted to run, but he called me and told me not to be afraid, as he was a very peaceful person who never did harm to any living being. So I asked him who he was to live in this cavern. He said, \"I am an Atlantean- Inca, the guardian of this door.\" He asked me what I was looking for. I told him I was looking for my race, because I too am an Inca. He seemed to be very pleased to hear this. I told him I would like to visit his city, and that I had an American friend, and a wife that would like to go there too, with my children... On this second visit to the Atlantean he delivered a lecture on radioactivity and its danger. He said that radioactive dust in the air is causing surface dwellers to age very rapidly because it accumulated in the pores of the skin and stops sk in respiration. He said the pores of the skin have a constant alternate contraction and expansion and serve to take in air and expel foreign matter. In an atmosphere of radioactive dust metals, there substances clog up the pores and interfere with their vi tal functions of respiration and excretion. This causes disease and early death."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 17 The Atlantean called me to come near a transparent screen to make an exchange of blood to make sure I will preserve the secret of the whereabouts of this tunnel, so that I do not reveal it to an unworthy person. When I was near the curved plastic screen, another curved plastic screen suddenly appeared from each side of the door and encompassed me, so that I found myself inside the two curved plastic screens. Then it seemed that all air was pumped out, leaving a vacuum in the space where I was between the plastic screens. Then other air entered, which seemed lighter and purer, which made me feel more healthful and stronger. Then the inside plastic door opened, and he put inside a man- sized capsule of this transparent substance which he held by handles on both sides of it, and told me to go inside the open door. After I was inside, the door automatically closed. Now the second plastic door opened and the Atlantean took hold of the handles on each side of the capsule and carried me to the other side of the inside plastic screen whose door automatically opened and shut... He told me not to bring here any unworthy person, because he would know it in advance. I asked how. He said that with this apparatus, which he called an \"electrovisor,\" he could behold whatever was occurring in any part of the world. If any unworthy person comes near the mountain and tries to get to the tunnel opening, certain rays confuse the person's mind, so t hat he is unable to continue the trip and will go off in a wrong direction. I had some bread in a pocket. He told me not to eat the bread. He put a white pill in my hand (which was projected outside the capsule all the time), and told me this pill had the taste of many fruits. Then I withdrew my hand and the plastic material through which it projected closed. After he gave me the pill he carried the capsule with me inside to the space between the two plastic screens, as the door of the inside screen opened to admit the capsule and then automatically shut. Then the door of the capsule opened. I left the capsule, and then the door of the outside plastic screen opened and I left. When newcomers enter, they first enter the capsule, and the Atlantean carries th em to a Decontamination Chamber (the Atlantean told me). The door of the capsule opens, the person leaves the capsule, takes off his clothing, then the chamber becomes filled with vapor, which draws forth radioactive poisons from his body. The person dresses with other clothing there ready for him, then enters an \"electrical apparatus,\" which carries him [towards] the center of the earth. I should mention that during my visits, before the door opened I heard a peculiar humming sound, which was of the appara tus with which the Atlantean came up from below, which became louder and louder as the apparatus came near, and when it came to a stop the noise stopped and the doors automatically opened."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 18 I should also mention that when a flying saucer came near my ho use on Saturday, June 13, 1959, in the afternoon and night, it gave off an identical hum as this subterranean apparatus, which makes me think they are both operated by the same mechanism and that the flying saucer was an apparatus of those same subterranea n Atlantean's and did not come from another planet. The flying saucer came describing a spiral which descended on top of a hill about 2000 meters from my house, and then rose in a spiral manner, with a tail of light behind it. It came in the night, had a r ound shape and a silver color. I believe it was sent by subterranean Atlantean's , who knew where I lived and came especially near my house. 11 These details related by Bernard are all the more remarkable when one considers their timeframe, prior to 1960! T he accounts of a peculiar loud humming that accompanied both the subterranean elevator and the vimana 'flying saucer' are now known to be ultra -low frequency soundwaves used for antigravitic control. The Atlantean's brief mention of technological remote vi ewing and rays that would confuse any visitor with negative intensions are also applications of ultra -low frequency waves being developed by today's scientists. Blood sampling for DNA study in the screening of visitors is also logical, as modern researcher s have now been able to show a genetic predisposition to psychopathic behaviour. Likewise, the lesson given by the Atlantean on radioactive dust metals in the atmosphere is confirmed by the ancient evidence of nuclear blasts in the archaeological record, as well as by modern indiscriminate use of depleted uranium (DU) weaponry. Modern medicine has also recently developed the process called electroporation that was described to Bernard prior to 1960 as a natural cellular function that has become blocked by atmospheric conditions. The detailed account of decontamination processes involving electroporation is extremely scientifically accurate, as informed by newly developed heat - resistant piezoelectric plastics such as PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) that form the vacuum chamber into which HHO gas is flooded before becoming an electrified plasma. Further investigations of the unique properties of superfluid plasmas have been conducted by a group at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology led by Dr. Ketterle. The group's experiments have defined the parameters necessary for the creation of superfluid plasma beams. An infrared light ray is used as a pathway that is then surrounded by a strong encircling electromagnetic field. These conditions efficiently contain the plasma when released into the IR beam. They have found that a pair of rotating green lasers within the IR beam induces the frictionless rotation of the superfluid plasma , which subsequently forms an array of hexagonal vortices that maintain the crystalline structure of the ionized gas."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 19 Ketterle's experimental results have apparently replicated the 'ultraviolet fog beams' related in the vast majority of extraterrestrial encounters. Physical transport via levitation in ultraviolet beams have been reported for decades, including riveting descriptions of the intense sensations of heat and light that accompany the events. The consistency of the contemporary eyewitness accounts of these advanced plasma technologies is astounding, and when analyzed in the context of the latest human technological developments one finds a profound synchronicity. Twenty -first century science has completed both the mathematical and experimental groundwork enabling a new comprehension of high -energy realms beyond common human experience. Plasma is the fourth state of matter, with the highest energy and lowest density, followed by gas, liquid and solid states. The ignition of fire is a commonly witnes sed event where gas becomes ionized to form plasma. The realm of human beings is a gas- filled resonating atmosphere in which we experience a three - dimensional world. A four -dimensional extraterrestrial realm of resonant plasmas passes through and beyond the human reality, apparently inhabited by electroluminous paraphysical beings. While still higher realms of aphysical consciousness - thought at large - must exist, all human contact with this realm necessarily occurs via thought, dream, intuition, meditat ion or channeling. The channeled Cassiopaea contacts of Laura Knight -Jadczyk provide a very broad frame of reference and apt termin - ology which we will apply here in our discussion of the relationship of the gas and plasma realms –as 'third -density' and 'fourth -density' environments. Matter brought into the high -energy plasma environment decreases in density thus allowing molecular interpenetration. Evidence of the hyperdimensional inter - penetration of matter have been found in the debris of tornadoes. One such anomaly has been described more than once - a windowframe with a wood plank passing right through its unbroken pane of glass. Superconducting plasma aerial vehicles achieve frictionless passage through air, water or stone as there is no displacement of matter, allowing velocities and maneuverablity impossible for objects in third -density. The wave motion of acoustic propagation that is created in a third -density atmosphere of air is not present in fourth -dens ity plasmas, which lack the temperature differentials that bend sound into waveforms. The fourth -density environment creates a coherent energy transfer, inducing unified telepathic consciousness without any information loss as minds are electromagnetically coupled in group synchrony. The biocompatability of HHO plasmas accurately described in Bernard's account is quite similar to later reports of extraterrestrial encounters from other parts of the world. Michael Hesemann's breathtaking documentary film 'Sh ips of Light: The Carlos Diaz UFO Experience' presents overwhelming video and photographic evidence of fourth -density technology. Diaz vividly describes the initial sensation of heart throbbing at 1.45 Hz entrainment that precedes his extraterrestrial cont acts. This powerful infrasound effect can now be understood as part of the propulsion system of the fourth -density craft, suggesting its invisible presence is maintained nearby before Carlos becomes aware of it. The craft then makes a luminous and visually dramatic appearance only when he has mentally prepared himself for the contact: "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 20 Q: In what form do the contacts happen? There is a very special sensation concentrated in the solar plexus of my body – a sensation like when one is strongly in love. Th is sensation sometimes wakes me up at night, and I know that I am going to have an encounter with them. What I enjoy about the experiences I have had is that the communication I have with them is just as we are having at this moment. Q: So it’s an absolut ely physical contact? You can touch them? Yes, I can touch them... and at times they present a body of light... Sometimes these ships appear at a great altitude, coming down slowly to hover eventually over the ground at an altitude of one and a half feet . When it is still at a high altitude the movements of the ship are very unstable, but when it hovers over the ground it is completely static. But it also happens that the ship suddenly appears right on the spot. For me, it is a kind of magic. They come directly out of the light slowly, part for part. Their body emerges out of the wall of light... Their craft use the natural energy belts of the planet. Sometimes they enter into the belts, letting themselves flow with the energy. If they want to maintain on e position they must act against the flow of the energy belts, causing the erratic movements of the craft. Once they are in the natural energy flow they travel at high speeds..."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 21 At different opportunities during my encounters I experienced how a beam o f light shot out of the craft. This beam of light has the purpose to bring insects, plants, pollen, small and bigger animals aboard the ship, and sometimes we too, my friend and I, were brought aboard by such a ray. This beam directly forms and emerges fro m the ship, and consists of the same light or energy of the ship itself. The first time he invited me consciously to go into a ship, I saw my friend getting in first. He went through this fog -like light. When more than half of his body was inside of the light his body got sucked into the object. So, what I did first is that I put one hand into the light to feel, and to my surprise it went through the light and inside I felt a nice temperature. When I took my hand out I was relieved to see it was in one pie ce, so that gave me the confidence to walk in, and when I had my body halfway inside the object I was sucked into it too. But once you are into it there is nothing you can see. You just see yellow light all over. You don’t feel your toes. You don’t feel th e floor, but the sensation is very peculiar, because you feel very peaceful, with a lot of love within you. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 22 Once when I came out of the yellow light I realized I was not at the same place, but in a cave. It had stalactites and stalagmites, and between them I saw several sculptures and ornaments which were of the art of the Maya culture. This big cave was the place where the ship hovered and there was a kind of path we walked through and we came to another cave, and I saw there many people who were very k ind to me and greeted me... But the particular thing about this cave was that there were seven egg -like spheres of yellow light. After we got to this place my friend stuck his hand into one of the eggs and took out a small ball of light, also yellow, and s aid that this little ball could project a ray that would touch my seventh vertebrae or at the middle of the spine and it would take all of the information in my neurons. Once I was there in this place he invited me to go into one of those spheres or egg s of light. When I did so, I realized that all the yellow color changed, and it was not yellow anymore, but was a scene of a forest from the air. It was like as if I was flying. And then I saw on each of my sides a wing – the wing of an eagle, and I realiz ed what I was looking at was the information from an eagle, his memories, that they had stored into this egg of light. Once... my good friend Jaime Maussan asked me to ask them where they come from. So when I was with one of them the next time, we were wa lking near Mextitla, I asked him ‘Where are you from?’, and he smiled and said, ‘Look Carlos, I can give you the name of any star, any constellation, any galaxy, but what would this tell you? As far as you have gotten is your moon, so it makes no sense if I tell you where we come from since you can’t go there and verify. For me, this answer was enough even though when I was with them I once heard them to mention a star named Maya, and when I looked into an astronomy book that there is in the constellation o f the Pleiades a star named Maya. Maybe this is where they come from but I really don’t know... "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 23 After entering these spheres or eggs of light, I understood that they store a great wealth of information in them, not just about human beings, but about al l forms, all manifestations of life. They don’t only store images, they also store senses. When you are there you feel like an eagle, like a bird – I felt joy, I felt fear – and I have seen many types of environments; the sea, the ice, jungles. What I have learned from this is that every living thing is important for this wonderful planet. They also offered to show me what they stored about the past of my own life but I didn’t want to know, because what I want to do is go forward, and to try to act with a ll the things I have learned to live this experience. I had experienced that there is a wonderful interaction between all living things, but this interaction went out of control. Every individual, every species is an important part of this interaction. This is the reason why I want to share all of this with the whole world – to invite the people to act in order to save the Earth – to make it a true paradise for all living creatures, and to inherit our future generations a living planet. 12 Profound experien ces shared with Carlos through advanced transdimensional consciousness technologies have inspired a deepening understanding of the interdependence and unity of all life in the cosmos, and the urgency of the need to preserve the living systems of our mother Earth. The organic, jellyfish -like appearance of the plasma ships photographed by Diaz reflects a natural beauty by i mitating the rhythmic bioluminescence of bacterial colonies symbiotically living within deep ocean creatures, which become stimulated to generate the brightly pulsating spot ted display s of squid (above). Carlos Diaz's astonishing video footage of plasma beam technology has confounded the experts, including digital video and photo analyst Jim Dilettoso of Village Labs in Tempe, Arizona: "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 24 The r ay of light that comes down, when we look at it frame by frame, the light of the ray... [is] darker the top than it is at the bottom... and it goes off the same way. At each incident when the light goes on... the variance is between one frame, a thirtieth if a second. Well if [the ray] was [propagated] at the speed of light, we wouldn’t even see it in a frame. It would be off and then on... which is curious. So, I’m still trying to understand it. The false assumption that the ray is a simple beam of light has caused great confusion, as the intensity of the beam increases from top to bottom over the period of three video frames or one tenth of a second. The same three- frame shift in intensity from top to bottom is also noted when the beam recedes. The const ant of the speed of light denies the possibility of a single source of emanation, suggesting that the beam is an emission of plasma. This notion is corroborated by the recent experimental results of Ketterle's MIT group, from which we can infer that the be am is initiated as a faint ray of infrared light subsequently flooded by HHO plasma in one tenth of a second. Knowledge of the properties of plasma beams and the effect of acoustic levitation by use of standing waves informs the authenticity of the images, as for Dr. August Meessen, Professor of physics at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium: As far as I see there are no objections against [the Dia z documentary photographs and videos ], because if it is true it is very interesting for me as a confirmation of the theory where one expected results of this type... I developed a theory for the propulsion of classical objects... [which are] axis- symmetric objects... How do they produce electromagnetic waves which surround the object? ...One of the pred ictions of the [Unified Field] theory... [is] that they should be able to create standing waves with certain modes where at certain regularly distributed places you have a higher intensity, thus you could eventually ionize differently. If the theory is cor rect you could expect that somewhere observations like [those of Carlos Diaz] should appear. Dr. Meessen accurately identifies the aerial activity over Tepotzlan, Mexico as involving ionizing spacecraft that restore energy by absorption of terrestrial inf rasound standing waves that converge on the area, as described to Carlos as ‘energy belts’ by the extraterrestrials in contact with Carlos Diaz. Meessen has arrived at the same conclusions concerning standing waves as had Nikola Tesla, the original discove rer of the fascinating acoustic phenomenon, and have bee n applied by this author as spherical infrasound resonance maps of the Earth , flowering from the Giza Prime Meridian:"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 25 The discovery of the stationary terrestrial waves... [indicates] that, despite it s vast extent, the entire planet can be thrown into resonant vibration like a little tuning fork; that electrical oscillations suited to its physical properties and dimensions pass through it unimpeded, in strict obedience to a simple mathematical law... 13 [T]he Earth responds to a great number of vibrations and can be resonantly excited just like a wire of limited dimensions. When this takes place there are formed on its surface stationary parallel circles of equal electrical activity , which can be revea led by properly attuned [infrasound] instruments... Then the crests and hollows of the stationary waves would be in parallel [or concentric] circles [enveloping the entire planet] ... 14 Tesla’s most profound discoveries in those last several months of the 19 th century would go unpublished for almost 80 years, yet find direct relevance to the advancements of resonant technologies of the 21 st century and beyond. The concise explanations of Nikola Tesla provide insight into the technological aspect of fourth -density experiences reported by extraterrestrial contactees and abductees alike. The enveloping brilliance of violet, yellow or golden light – combined with an intense sensation of the warmth of Eternal Love– are among the transdimensional experiences that lea ve many at a loss for words. Many unmistakable aspects of advanced bioelectrical bodily purification processes using HHO plasma have been well documented. Closely echoing Bernard's 1960 report, Diaz also underwent plasma decontamination and was given frui t concentrate pills to ingest instead of the normal third -density metabolism based on the digestion of organic material. The impeccable and extensive video and photographic evidence presented by Diaz documents the fourth -density conditions of intense light and heat of HHO plasma within the beam transport and in the plasma ship itself (opposite). This remarkable enhancement of the luminosity of the atmospheric conditions reflects the atmospheric environment present on the homeworlds of those space -travelers, affecting DNA enhancements not present in the terrestrial human populations of Earth. DNA evidence of this kind was actually obtained by Australian Peter Khoury, who has collected and preserved a single translucent hair from one of his several disturbin g extraterrestrial encounters investigated by Bill Chalker: It was not until 1996 that I heard from Peter Khoury about the hair sample that had been recovered from what may have been an alien abduction sexual assault case... By 1998, I began an investigatio n into the hair sample, when biochemical colleagues agreed to undertake what was the world's first PCR (polymerase chain reaction) DNA profiling of biological material implicated in an alien abduction experience. The analysis confirmed the hair came from s omeone who was biologically close to normal human genetics, but of an unusual racial type - a rare Chinese Mongoloid type - one of the rarest human lineages known, that lies further from the human mainstream than any other except for African pygmies and ab originals."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 26 "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 27 There was the strange anomaly of it being blonde to clear instead of black, as would be expected from the Asian type mitochondrial DNA. The study concluded, \"The most probable donor of the hair must therefore be as (Khoury) claims: a tall bl onde female who does not need much color in her hair or skin, as a form of protection against the sun, perhaps because she does not require it [in a luminous fourth -density environment] ...\" The original DNA work was done on the shaft of the hair. Fascinat ing further anomalies were found in the root of the hair. Two types of DNA were found depending on where the mitochondrial DNA testing occurs, namely confirming the rare Chinese type DNA in the hair shaft and indicating a rare possible Basque/Gaelic type D NA in the root section... [The female’s appearance is illustrated below, based on Khoury’s detailed descriptions.] This was very puzzling and controversial, until a 'Nature Biotechnology' paper appeared in 2000. It revealed recent findings on hair transpl anting with previously incompatible hair, using advanced cloning techniques, developed in a possible cure for baldness. We seem to be seeing similar combined or \"grafted\" DNA in the sample recovered under controversial circumstances by Peter Khoury back in 1992. Perhaps even more controversial is that we have findings suggestive of nuclear DNA indicating possible viral resistance. The hair sample seems to show it contains 2 deleted genes for CCR5 protein and no intact gene for normal undeleted CCR5 - th is CCR5 deletion factor has been implicated in AIDs resistance. To keep a very complex story somewhat uncomplicated, what seems to be suggested by the range of findings is possible evidence for advanced DNA techniques and DNA anomalies and findings, for wh ich we are only now discovering or starting to make sense of in mainstream biotechnology. While the unusual experiences of Bernard and Diaz were of a very positive nature, the sexual assault case of Khoury is by contrast quite negative. Yet in all of these cases the powerful emotive interaction between the extraterrestrials and the contactees is obvious, as one might expect of primarily telepathic beings. Diaz provides extensive video and photographic evidence that support his experiences, while Oliveira and Khoury have collected the most convincing physical evidence of HHO plasmas and an extraterrestrial DNA sample. When compared and contrasted, their corroborated accounts and evidence of hyperdimensional transport compellingly point to a single, remarka ble conclusion: that technologically advanced Sanskrit cultures of the deep human past have not perished, but have in fact transcended our toxic third -density realm to achieve vastly extended lifespans in fourth -density plasma environments developed in sub terranean chambers and flying vimana discs. The stark synchronicity of evidence from these extraterrestrial contacts with the emerging human technologies of acoustic levitation, HHO plasma, electroluminescent metals and piezoelectric plastics informs a broadened perspective. By synthesizing these scientifically described and extraterrestrially demonstrated technologies, humanity is at the threshold of a hyperdimensional transition to the unified consciousness of the fourth -density realm."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 28 Advanced HHO plasm a technology will soon significantly expand the consciousness and extend the lifespan of human beings living on Earth’s surface, thus closing the circle of time to reunite with our advanced ancient ancestors concurrently dwelling in fourth- density.

Fleets of plasma ships have been videotaped a t high -altitudes over the vicinity of Mexico City in various large formations, including long chains of ships that appear like floating helical DNA strands (below). Such odd and spectacular plasma ship formations are orchestrated to reawaken human curi osity and announce the presence of higher dimensional realities, while most fourth -density spacecraft pass through Earth’s atmosphere without being perceived by terrestrial humans.

After applying a Russian tester in the vicinity of the Nevado de Cachi, they concluded that the signals are not natural in origin, and rather originate by machinery operated by intelligent beings... \"The oscillations clearly indicate that kilometers beneath the surface there is activity: alternating electrical waves, which means a power source,\" said Hesse. \"This could mean engines,\" he added. 15 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 29 The constantly maintained acoustic signals of deep subterranean cities present convincing evidence that such highly advanced facilities are powered by infrasound standing wave resonance, in alignment with the pyramids on the Earth’s surface above.

Transit to and from these deep underground cities is achieved by transdimensional passage directly through the bedrock by retuning the atomic frequency of the entire ship, its interior HHO plasma atmosphere and crew to safely interpenetrate the material realm. The transdimensional ships’ generate thin veils of HHO plasma surrounding the vessel that can instantaneously shift the frequency of all emitted light into the infrared range for invisibility cloaking, or be tuned to generate visible light of any desired frequency.

The Sanskrit artifacts from La Maná fluoresce under ultraviolet light, as absorbed UV radia tion is converted into reemitted light of visible wavelengths – a process that is also generated within the electroluminescent crystalline metals of transdimensional plasma spacecraft. Complex metal alloys synthesized for acoustic levitation using cosmic infrasound standing waves convert the strong electromagnetic fields of the ships’ internal HHO plasma chambers into reemitted visible light from the external surfaces, tuned as desired for various aerial displays or using infrared radiations outside of the visible spectrum of the vast majority of terrestrial humans beings. The enigmatic experiences reported by hundreds of thousands of eyewitnesses of extraterrestrial spacecraft transiting Earth’s skies are now explicable in scientific terms, as nonlinear e ffects of quantum resonance. Primary identification of the optimal material properties for antigravity alloys have been experimentally tested and reported by more than one group. The axis -symmetric shape of the object to be levitated, as well as its r esonant crystalline material composition, endows antigravitic properties that act to transduce incident radiation into resonant standing waves encircling the object. Fran De Aquino , physicist at Maranhao State University in S. Luis, Br azil, has mathematically modeled antigravitic effects observed in the extra- low frequency acoustic levitation of electroluminescent objects: According to the weak form of Einstein's general relativity equivalence principle, the gravitational and inertial masses are equivalent... [To the contrary,] we have shown that the gravitational mass and the inertial mass are correlated by an adimensional factor, which depends on the incident radiation upon the pa rticle. It was shown that only in the absence of electromagnetic radiation this factor becomes equal to 1 and that... it can be reduced, nullified or made negative by means of extra- low frequency (ELF) radiation.

It is this cosmic energy, by which the artificial life forms are animated and also made alive. All this, however, couldn’t be recognized by all the doctors, surgeons, and pathologists, etc. in the American secret stations, where the crashed android beings were taken. But how could they, since their knowledge relating to this wasn’t in place yet? In fact, it will still take many centuries and even several millennia before the terrestrial scientists arrive at the possibility of creating such beings as the bioorganic androids.

A young radio/electrical engi neer living in Richard’s Bay, South Africa (above) , ‘F. Edwin W.’ (alias) received radio transmissions from a cosmonaut in Earth orbit named Valdar, from the planet Koldas. Subsequent years of regular radio contacts and comprehensive face -to-face conversat ions included other wise cosmic visitors from a Confederation of Planets in alliance with Koldas. Extensive and profound information shared during the visits of Va ldar, Kashendo, Taylanz and Wy -Ora were recorded and later published by Carl van Vlierden in 1986. Edwin was told that the primary structure of the Confederation of 12 Planets was peacefully founded in the Grandor star system, comprised of planets Grandor, Leec Goran, Sparlane, Velaan and Novan; and has extended to include the planets of neighbor ing systems like Koldas, Salamia, Siton, Bryonne, Pyrole, Pyrc Furvey and Triaxula. Valdar provided Edwin with a basic description of his homeworld, Koldas – a giant world with freshwater oceans reflecting the purity of planetary systems at high resonance: ‘It is many times larger than Earth. We have seas on Koldas, but these are freshwater seas. There are also large lakes, the largest about 24,000 km long and 20,000 km wide. Some of the towns of Koldas are in the mountain regions while others are by the sea. The towns are similar to yours, except that buildings are constructed differently. There are no roads here for our vehicles travel above the surface of the ground. Our buildings are linked by conveyors to take people to their destination. Our capital city is vast, much larger than New York. Of course there are rural areas with smaller homes for one or two families, and there are forests and also rivers. In the large lakes there are islands where you find holiday resorts. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 47 ‘Our way of life is very simil ar to that of Earth. What I am trying to impress upon you is that we do not differ from you. The only difference is our mental attitude. Our way of life is different. We have no monetary system; no currency whatsoever. Each planet in the Confederation prod uces and plays a vital part in the whole. Some are rich in minerals and supply these to the others and some are more suitable for cultivation. Koldas, with its seas or lakes, has an abundance of fish, harvests of which are sent to other planets in the Confederation in exchange for minerals and materials to build the powerful Astrael -craft. And so my friends, a chain of good-will and understanding links all our planets. Earth too could play a part in this Confederation... We are like you. We are in the flesh. We feel pain and we die. The difference is that we are able to travel at this fantastic speed.’ 1 The visitors from Koldas spoke in words of genuine compassion during their many radio contacts with Edwin (below). Valdar expressed deep sorrow concerning t he intense suffering of children of war: Valdar then reiterated that most of Earth's governments, political rulers and Superiors, knew of the Koldasian operations and the Confederation. He said they had known of the presence of Confederation craft over their countries and in the oceans for a very long time... ‘What makes me sad,’ Valdar said, ‘is the unnecessary bloodshed and warfare on Earth. I often think of the little children who are the innocent victims of all this violence. Infants without homes hav ing to find refuge, food and water, yet they have no idea why their parents are at war. There are areas of dire poverty. All these scenes and much more were recently recorded by the three -day aerial survey. This too contributes to the Confederation's decision to withdraw their patrols.’ 2 The observation of humanity and monitoring of the rapid development of Earthly civilization is a primary task of Confederation vessels, including the older Astraelcraft and newer Corynthian spacecraft, which incorporates their most advanced designs with automatic instrumentation, representing a most formidable interstellar craft, in terms of both annihilating power and instant translocating capacity: ‘The craft used by space -travelers range from two -seater scout -craft c arried by their motherships, to the largest masterpieces of design and technology which are veritable floating cities in space. The Confederation spacecraft were spherical in appearance prior to 1941. It was these craft which were used to explore the Unive rse and solar systems many thousands of years ago. Then the spherical craft were superceded by the Astraelcraft. These were named by the Koldasian designer in honor of his wife Astraelda. Other smaller craft are disc -shaped. Larger carriers are cigar -shape d and measure in kilometers. These are used for cargo and passengers."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 48 ‘All these craft are propelled by magnetic flux. The magnetic streams have different layers with various velocities. The motors, with which all craft are fitted, serve as rudders direct ing the craft into the various velocity layers. The highest velocity is reached on the outer surface and can exceed that of light. The magnetic streams criss- cross deep space, connecting planets, solar systems, galaxies and even universes in a vast web of highways and by -ways for space- travelers and their craft...’ 3 Koldas had enjoyed 20 centuries of history without fighting of any kind and consequently the only deterrent they could muster was their fleet of Astrael spacecraft. These craft are not intended for military service but are equipped with a ‘Sun -ray’ disintegrating laser or charged particle ray gun which is designed to annihilate meteorites in the magnetic traffic lanes. Its pencil- like ‘laser’ beam stabs at any object, destroying it in a brilliant flash without leaving a trace... 4 I scrambled up against the side of the dune where I had a good view of the spacecraft as it touched down on the beach. As it came closer, I could see how enormous it was. It must have been close to 50 meters in diameter... I heard a low hum... It then rose up into the air... The ship now moved out over the surf, rising all the time... The craft itself was not emitting any light... The outside was steel grey in color but shiny. One could not see any rivets or joints or welds; it seemed to be one complete moulding, like two saucers put rim to rim. 5 The technological advancement of Koldasian spacecraft reflects their comprehensive understanding of the nature of the human spirit. The physical limitations of corporeal existence have been mitigated by the artificial control of matter, space and time – freeing the human being to explore transdimensionality. Valdar’s brief description of the spiritual views prevalent among the Confederation planets is highly reminiscent of the ancient S anskrit traditions passed down through the ages from their original dissemination on Earth during colonization events described to have occurred over 70,000 years ago: And he told me sometimes about the religion of the Confederation... He stressed that he d id not give such information with the idea of trying to introduce it to Earth. He did say that many of our ancient civilizations knew of their religion, which was taken to our planet by members of the Confederation approximately 70,000 years ago. They believe that there is One Supreme Being, usually referred to as the Divine One. This Being is infinite and all -powerful and He creates all things, seen and unseen. Also created by Him was his Son. When man was created, the Divine One placed within the body of man a spirit or the soul, which never dies but continues on to eternity. The task of man's soul is to rule the material body by overcoming material desires... When this is ac -"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 49 complished, the soul will be called back to the great source and forever live in perfect joy and happiness. They also believe that all mankind is created by the same Divine Force, therefore all mankind are brothers and sis - ters. But this is a mere outline of their religion; there is much more – for example, their belief in reincarnat ion. 6 The ancient idea of reincarnation present among most cultures of the world has only recently come under scientific scrutiny. Hypnotic access to memories of past lives stored in the subconscious mind enables the statistical comparison of specific psychological and physiological traits of successive incarnations of a spirit, whereby solid probability calculations can be made concerning the likely- hood of such a spiritual continuity. Well -documented reincarnation cases such as that of Jeffrey Keene and John B. Gordon (left) present so many extremely rare synchronicities – elusive ‘proofs’. In his discussions with Edwin, Kashendo described part of the Confederation’s master registry as a vast reincarnation database, which cross -references the specific c haracteristics of every sentient being within the planetary collective as a statistical aid in identifying the successive incarnations of a particular spirit: ‘Now as I promised,’ said Kashendo, ‘I shall tell you what we know of your past incarnations in our own Confederation... It is a vast subject and there is much to tell. Let me begin by saying that the master register is stored in a gigantic memory bank on the mother planet of Grandor. Here are the records of all beings who have lived lives in the Confe deration.’ Kashendo explained that the giant computer is housed in 37 buildings which are arranged in a circle around a central building. Most of the staff work in the central building which collects the required data from ‘memory cells’, consisting of t housands of transparent tubes with crystals inside them. Each tube is capable of storing many thousands of symbols and a memory bank consists of many thousands of these transparent tubes. The data is stored indefinitely and when needed the controllers extract it in coded form which is then decoded to provide the required information. All the equipment is very complex and kept in a special atmosphere. The memory cells store innumerable personal features and characteristics which reappear in the same individ ual through many lives. When a search is made, a special computer transmits the details of the required person to the whole range of memory cells. As soon as the features are recognized by a memory bank a message is transmitted back to the central control building where it is recorded. The whole process is complicated and Kashendo said that he found it difficult to describe it accurately, but he hoped it explained how the Grandorians are able to trace people's lives through time, at least within the Confede ration.’ 7 The scientific tracking of a particular spirit through its long string of incarnations is a statistical task that requires great computational capabilities, which the Grandorian record -keepers achieve using supercomputers operating in ‘a specia l atmosphere’ of fourth -density HHO plasma. The geometric configuration of 37 buildings housing the thousands of memory cells is precisely aligned in a circle around a central building to make use of infrasound standing waves for the focused distribution o f wireless power by which the HHO plasma chambers are resonantly synchronized. Edwin’s spirit had selected a reincarnation on Earth as a means of transmitting information for the benefit of humanity. One of Kashendo’s profound offerings of knowledge concer ning the human past and the deep history of Earth revealed the presence of once breathtaking cities laid to waste on the ocean floor, along with the giant wreckage of huge interstellar spacecraft which enabled the colonization of Earth by different races seeking refuge from various worlds in peril (rather than being a byproduct of evolutionary processes): "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 50 Kashendo spoke about the various races we have on Earth and said, ‘This is an intriguing subject but some of the mystery is known to the Confederation. We know that long before we first visited your planet, there were other visitors. When our ancient pioneers arrived there, they found evidence that whoever came before them must have come from systems far beyond those known to us. It is possible that the y wished to colonize Earth. We do not know for certain whether this explains the many different races, but we do know that the race which you call the Red Indian, had ancestors who came from a far away planet doomed to destruction. They were highly civilized and had mastered space- travel. They left their home planet in a giant craft to search for new planets to colonize and reached Earth and there they settled. It seems that they were abandoned by their people or were unable to return home, possibly for lack of fuel. Their craft was stranded and so they remained on Earth. They were forced to improvise and learn to live off the land. They made use of what they had and what they could find. They hunted the animals; and learned to use them for food and sustenan ce. ‘We know about these people, for they were very intelligent as a race, and one of the early ones to occupy Earth. But what about the many other races you have? We can only assume that they too were space travelers for we have definitely found the rema ins of many craft beneath your desert sands. Gigantic craft [have been found] which are not from the Confederation! Should these remains be discovered, they would cause a sensation on Earth as they are of enormous proportions. They must have carried thousa nds of people. ‘It is possible,’ he suggested, ‘that they never intended to return to their homes. Were they banished and perhaps sent away as punishment? We can only guess at the reason for their presence but the evidence of their arrival from other plan ets is there, beneath the sands. This may be one reason why there are so many different races on Earth... ‘When the Confederation carried out patrols beneath the surface of your oceans, they discovered many craft buried in the mud of the ocean floors. There is much evidence which will not be found soon, and much that has been lost. In another transmission I must tell you about the abandoned cities which lie beneath your Pacific Ocean; mysterious cities which must have been of great beauty before they disappe ared. What catastrophe befell Earth? Who were the builders of these matchless cities?’ 8 "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 51 These remarkable facts delivered by Kashendo attest to the great antiquity of human civilization on Earth, and the deep mystery of the cosmic origin of human racial diversity on Earth. While the existence of the remains of gigantic spacecraft below the (Sahara?) desert sands has been quite purposefully withheld from public knowledge by the world’s governments, the same astounding scale is plainly witnessed in the pyr amids of Giza, Egypt – designed to transduce and focus infrasound standing waves used for the propulsion of antigravitic plasma ships by acoustic levitation. Valdar explained: The pyramids... were used as transmitting and receiving stations and for the stor age of magno- solar energy. They were located in a strategic area and the ancient Starships used to home in on them... Their design is significant in more ways than one. In the coming changes on your planet, this pyramidal design will again be used in your buildings.’ 9 Other discussions with the Koldasian envoys confirm that the ‘pyramids [of Giza] were strategically placed in the geographic center of the land surface of the planet.’ 10 This fact was recently reported by investigators of the Great Flood, who analyzed sea level data to identify an ancient global flooding eve nt that raised sea levels by 178m, which offset the gravitic center of Earth’s landmass by hundreds of miles to the northeast of Giza. 11 This 178m sea level rise explains how the casing stone s of the central pyramid have re mained intact above that precise height, while those casing stones below that mark were gradually torn away by the erosive wave activity of slowly receding floodwaters (above). Long before the destruction of the pyramid re sonance network by the Great Flood, the Giza pyramids pulsed with a tri -thalamic frequency of 1.45 Hz to synchronize heart/mind rhythms throughout all of the sacred sites of the planet and act as a homing beacon for the legions of spacecraft in transit thr ough our solar system. The resonant excitation of planetary infrasound taps a vast reservoir of cosmic energy available to humanity once again through the oncoming changes, which include an intensification of planetary resonance. The deep hum of our planet , an infrasonic gravity field, is artificially recreated in all of the space -faring plasma ships’ magnetic motors, as described to Edwin during a transmission:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 52 Wy -Ora continued wistfully, ‘If only your governments would unite in peace and extend the in vitation, your skies would ring with the hum of magnetic motors... All our knowledge would be yours. All that we have achieved over the centuries would be given you freely. But unfortunately, your rulers cannot agree. They tell us many things; why they cannot accept us. But it all boils down to the fact that it would bring too many changes on Earth and that it would disturb the 'balance of things'.’ 12 In fact, all extraterrestrial matters have been kept secret by Nazi/CIA elements to preserve the present corruption of world governments, enforced by the military use of stealth technology stolen from Nikola Tesla in 1942. 13 The standing waves discovered by Tesla in 1899 14 display the same Fibonacci structure observed of galactic and solar systems (above), provid ing magnetic field lanes for magnetic propulsion: ‘Each solar system has a magnetic field. Once you have broken away from the gravitational field of your planet, you can make use of the magnetic fields of other planets and solar systems to travel vast dis tances and even change in time... On Earth you are using the wrong method of propulsion. You are using fuels, liquid or solid or whatever they may be. This does not take advantage of the vast reservoir of universal energy. There is an unlimited supply of thi s energy and power that can never be exhausted. This energy is there for mankind to use on your planet.’"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 53 ‘Let me explain further. The Astrael- craft I am in has eight magnetic motors; four forward and four reverse for control. These are actually giant e lectromagnets powered with solar energy. Now, beyond your planet there is a magnetic force -field which runs in streams between planets and solar systems, and even between galaxies and universes. Magnetic fields seem to run on forever. Once we are in a magnetic field we travel in this invisible stream through space. Our magnetic motors allow us to check and control our speed. Without them we could not select our destination. We would be helpless as a rudderless ship on a fast flowing river.’ ‘Once a certain velocity is reached, things begin to happen. For a little while, breathing becomes difficult and the craft is controlled by a master computer. As you arrive in other universes (dimensions) awareness returns. Craft, computer, personnel and all which have e xisted in the energy -state flowing along the magnetic paths, now reintegrate with their polarity changed, to become solid matter again. And that my friends, is all there is to it. It is the magnetic fields which carry us at these incredible speeds, an chan ging time is a side effect of it. Your craft on earth could do this if you had the magnetic motors!’ 15 The technical details of the magnetic motors were first discovered by Nikola Tesla during his wireless researches, and were later perfected in secret de signs for antigravitic spacecraft using infrasound standing waves and HHO plasma, derived from water. The implosion of atomic hydrogen forms the unique plasma that protects all interstellar spacecraft. The presence of galactic magnetic fields, vast cosmic highways described by Valdar in 1970, were only recently identified by Earth’s scientists in 2009:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 54 Last year, NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) made a discovery so profound that scientists had a hard time describing what they were seeing. A vast ribbon located in the outermost reaches of the solar system had been spotted, a structure that had never been seen before. Now scientists believe the shape might be created by a huge reflection caused by particles bouncing off a galactic magnetic fiel d... In December it was announced that the veteran Voyager probes currently flying toward the heliosphere measured an unexpected increase in magnetic field strength. Scientists believe that this increase is due to an unexpectedly large magnetic field threade d through a cloud of interstellar gas called the ‘Local Fluff.’ Our solar system is currently speeding into this Fluff... [which would more accurately be called ‘plasma’.] Jacob Heerikhuisen, a NASA Heliophysics Guest Investigator from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, believes the ribbon observed by IBEX is caused by an interstellar magnetic field... ‘We believe the ribbon is a reflection,’ said Heerikhuisen. ‘It is where solar wind particles heading out into interstellar space are reflected back into the solar system by a galactic magnetic field.’ 16 These newly identified galactic magnetic fields connect star systems within the spiraling arms of galactic wheels and act as propulsion lanes for interstellar spacecraft. The advancement of human consci ous - ness is required for the penetration of the light speed barrier, for which purpose the Koldasian visitors influence contactees like Edwin by a voluntary conditioning of the subconscious mind during deep sleep:"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 55 We asked Valdar about ‘conditioning’ dur ing a thought- transmission. He said that initially we were tested to see whether we had accepted the Confederation ‘way of life’... ‘ Only then ’ he continued, ‘various methods of conditioning are used. This is done mainly during thought -transmissions. We des cribe our planets to you – our way of life – and we answer your questions. Your subconscious minds are conditioned by us to store certain impressions gained during these transmissions. These are of great importance later on. ‘We continued to condition you mentally, so you will accept more of what we give you. This is a long procedure and is still in operation at the moment. We will continue until we are satisfied. This type of conditioning is done mainly at night, during the hours of sleep. While sleeping, everyone transmits a signal. This is normal and happens to everyone. We have instruments to 'tune in' to your particular signal; your personal frequency. Valdar continued, ‘You know that you all have a forward or conscious mind. You also have a mind th at lies dormant, which we call the 'back' mind or the subconscious. This back mind accumulates a great deal of knowledge and a great variety of impressions lie stored there. A brain is like a computer. It may reach a stage where it will not accept any more . Then it refuses to receive new impressions and this mainly applies to one's subconscious mind. Then it becomes necessary to unburden this subconscious mind. This is to prepare you for all the new information you will acquire. ‘We have a method of conditioning by which we rid your subconscious mind of much that has been impressed upon it, making way for new conditioning. This has been carefully programmed for each one individually, to suit your mission and type of work. All data and information is placed there. This continues stage by stage, depending on how you accept it. It all depends on you. ‘We can tell what you have recorded of the information we have placed there and what you have received during the various transmissions via the thought -channel. T hen comes a very important stage – the most important of all – and you are going through this stage at the moment. This is the stage in the program where you must accept a new way of life. I have already mentioned how strange things are beyond your solar system. ‘All this has been placed in your mind and it is done to alert your subconscious to be prepared. We are going to place in your memory -bank vital information that is needed if you should ever have to travel beyond your solar system, so that it will not refuse to accept what it will see and what conditions will prevail when you travel in Outer Space... You see, there are conditions which one cannot describe. One has to experience them to realize what is meant. One's body undergoes a drastic change in in terstellar flight, for you will travel many times faster than the speed of light. Your body may be shattered into millions of particles and even your mind may experience this disintegration. This may sound more frightening than it is. ‘Now, when you are in that stage of disintegration, you will exist... and yet, you do not exist. For you (the consciousness) are there in 'energy particles' – you actually flow . Yes, the word flow describes it accurately, for you cannot leave your Universe unless you are abl e to flow through the magnetic field, coasting along the magnetic force lines. One cannot escape from your Universe and enter an other -matter Universe unless one undergoes change. You see there is a strange law out there, a law that has existed since the birth of the two Universes. There is a dividing line, which is invisible, beyond which nothing can go, not even light rays . "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 56 Therefore, to escape beyond that invisible barrier one must undergo great change. When the craft, including all its occupants, goes t hrough this change, it is completely disintegrated into its elementary particles – into energy. After that one does not travel at speed anymore, as this does not describe it. One then travels in such a way that there are no words to express it. .. This hap pens only for a certain distance; the distance between the two Universes. Then one emerges into the anti -matter Universe and the craft and occupants revert back to solid bodies again, the process being reversed [to induce rematerialization]. ‘Let us put it this way. A container filled with water is suddenly spilled upon the floor where it spreads out. Now, suppose you had a magnet that could attract water. Place this near the spill on the floor and suddenly, it becomes one body of water again. This illust rates what happens when you disintegrate your body and craft into elementary particles - spread it out, so to speak - so you can flow from one Universe to another. You would flow through gigantic magnetic fields, which are of such high intensity that when you break through that invisible barrier you become energy and travel in time. ‘This is the most important part of your conditioning because when you arrive on the other side, there is a world that you could never imagine! There are vast differences. Y ou would not be as you were when you left your Universe. You would be in a new environment. Nature has molded you to live on Earth; you were never intended to go through the polarity barrier. It would be impossible for you to live on our planet the way you are now. To begin with, gravitation is so great that you would not be able to breathe. Koldas is such a large planet; the forces of gravity are correspondingly greater. You might survive, but under such great torture... ‘That is why Nature remolds you when you penetrate that invisible barrier. It adapts you, not gradually, but suddenly, to the new environment. Even if your body might be able to adapt itself to the new environment, your conscious mind would not. Your subconscious mind does not care where it is, but your forward or conscious mind could not cope... It is fortunate that you all have a subconscious mind, otherwise it would be impossible for any of you to leave your Universe. Here we have a storehouse where all this vital information can be placed. We program your subconscious and tell it exactly what to expect; how to react; what to do and how to do it. So when you make your final jump and you arrive at the new world, your subconscious has been trained to take full command. Then you will no longer h ave a subconscious mind; then the complete brain will function – you will need it! Indeed you will. The new world is much larger – every solar system is so much greater; the way of life is so different... The things one has to do would require your thought capacity to be so much larger – your concentration, your eyesight, speech, breathing, much more... then the subconscious would disappear... Only on Earth is the mind divided into a conscious and subconscious. Although we in the Confederation do have a subc onscious mind, it is very small indeed. So you see, this is the most important part of the conditioning. Other stages consist of being taught various things, such as communication and telepathy and the acceptance of new colors. We respond to a greater rang e of colors. This extended vision is very important and has given us problems with some who have left Earth. We have found that their brains will not accept the wider range and intensity (of the colors) and they become muddled and very confused. So it has become necessary for our scientists to develop new means of conditioning to allow one to accept this."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 57 ‘It is difficult to explain all this to you. I do not compile this program for conditioning, myself; it is done by scientists who have spent their lives o n this work. Each one of you is well known, not only to one particular scientist, but to many scientists. Every one of you has accepted and passed the first stage. Now there is a pause and it is my job to find out more about you. I have to find out much a bout each one of you, right down to the last detail, and all this is recorded and submitted to the panel of scientists who deal with mental programming. They then make a very careful study of all the data and select the best methods for your individual nee ds. ‘This may be different for each person. In some cases, photographs are needed. This we manage also and every detail is taken into account. It is very necessary that all these details are considered, as we cannot afford any errors in conditioning one wrongly, for it could do much damage, especially if the person needed to visit the antimatter Universe. If he or she were wrongly programmed, it could be fatal. Remember, in the fluid stage, while you are flowing between the two Universes, we rely on your subconscious to piece you together again in the correct way. For example, your height and your weight would increase. You would become more robust, depending on which solar system you are visiting . If your destination were Triaxula, then it would be in rev erse. You would automatically adapt to the environment... ‘You see, once you are beyond the light barrier, that invisible line which separates our two Universes; once you have made the first crossing of the line, you can at any time travel at or beyond the barrier, disintegrate and reform and coast through the magnetic fields at will. You will find subsequent crossings much easier and faster. It is like being in two different seas. You are in one, and we are in the other. We, for instance, found that when we break through to your Universe, various difficulties arose. Difficulties in breathing [can occur]. Your sunlight interferes with our eyesight a great deal and we find your atmosphere very humid, even in your colder regions. So you see, once you leave your Universe and break through that barrier, your body automatically takes on the right shape and size and you adapt to the environment, provided that you have been properly conditioned. You will find that your brain capacity also increases and this is whe n the information which we have given you in our training will find a place. Your present brain is suited to your planet and present age. If you were to come to our planet with the same brain capacity as you now have, you would be in a great danger and trouble, for you would not be able to understand us and we would not be able to understand you. You would be as a primitive prehistoric creature would be if placed in your present society. That is why it is necessary to have this background training, this [vo luntary process of advanced, subconscious mental] conditioning. ‘And when all of you have completed this, then you will be on our level. You are then full -fledged Koldasians, Byronnians, or Triaxulans or whatever the case may be. You would then find that you could travel at will from planet to planet, without any problem. And once you are beyond the light barrier, you will have no difficulty, even with the language. But this is new! The conditioning for language has never been used before for the scientist s thought that it was far too much. Now they have realized that they can go much further and that is why, when you reach a certain stage, you will find that you have very strange dreams. These are very realistic dreams. You might even be able to smell or feel in these dreams. At first, this will prove alarming, for you may feel the heat of the day or the intense cold of the night. You will see things in your dreams, which we have placed there. You may, for example, experience living with nature. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 58 ‘We in the Confederation respect animal and plant life. We realize that without nature we would not live in a healthy and clean environment. As on Earth, nature is the same for us in the Confederation. Its beauty is very real to us! Mountains, streams, trees, fl owers are the things we love –it is part of our life. Although we have a very highly evolved technical world, this does not mar our sense of freedom nor our appreciation of the beauty of Creation. We too like to escape from those technological marvels of s cience we have created. We too like to escape into the country to admire the beauty of the Divine One's handiwork, the planet he has given us to live on... Mainly this is what we impress on people's subconscious so that your conscious mind would know what to expect when you arrive. Your subconscious is trained to accept your new body, which would be totally different from what it is now. Sure, you would not turn green, or blue, but you would become larger people to suit the Koldasian environment. You are now being conditioned to be very close to the Koldasian standard. ‘Yes, going through the light barrier is a very big step,’ said Valdar, slowly emphasizing each word. Even for those of us who are used to [the changes]... For we undergo subtle changes when w e arrive in your Universe. That is how we can mingle undetected with the population of Earth as we have done for a very long time in the past. But if we came here with the bodies of our Universe, we would be detected immediately. The major step is the abil ity to flow in the magnetic field through the light barrier. Of course, you would feel the changes here from planet to planet – gravity, heat, cold and so on. This you would experience, but your body has been conditioned to accept all this and much more. ‘Edwin has already reached the stage where we can use him to listen through his ears, see through his eyes and so observe local conditions on Earth. We can do this at our discretion and so keep in close touch with you all. Yes, you would be very surprised to see the real Edwin, the Koldasian Edwin – his twin. ‘Then, of course, age is a factor with the person being conditioned. The mind would also have to be adjusted to accept that the body would automatically become younger beyond the light barrier. This i t does for some reason or another. It seems that you get a new lease on life, regeneration. This applies to all those born on Earth. For us who are born in our other -matter Universe, long life is the norm... There are special rooms where this type of conditioning is done. These rooms look like the operating theatres in your hospitals on Earth. The carrier I am in at the moment has three such large rooms. In the centre, there is a couch on which the person to be conditioned lies down. Then a device, resembling a helmet, is strapped on the head... This is connected to the strata -recorder and the crystals, and the thought -impulses coming from these are transferred via this helmet"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 59 directly to the brain. We can accomplish this conditioning in about one hour. Howeve r, the person is first placed in a sleep state and firmly strapped -down where he or she remains until the light barrier has been passed. This is the normal procedure. Those who have been conditioned already would be treated as the crew and would be seated in the main control centre. This is where I prefer all passengers and the crew to be when we transcend. This main control centre is the safest area in an Astrael -craft. Once beyond the light barrier, things return to normal and one walks and sleeps, and one can use the craft as one would an ocean liner. Valdar continued his explanation. ‘I have used the word 'conditioning'. This is not strictly the right word to use; probably 'programming', training or teaching would be better expressions. Remember we do not do this against your will! It is entirely up to you. The very first step is that you accept us, then you automatically tune your mind to our wavelength and only then do we continue to prepare you for the next phase. I am really your teacher, with many assistants... Of course, those crystals and that valuable instrument, the strata -recorder, could not be dispensed with... Then another aspect of this conditioning program emerged when the discussion turned to the enigmatic subject called the ‘New Age’. Valdar said, ‘One has to be conditioned to accept the New Age. In the ancient scriptures of the Confederation, it is written that the Divine One will change many planets. ‘A voice tells us that there will be a change. The timing of the event will depend on m any circumstances. It might be caused by the separation of the two Universes resulting in a complete break in the magnetic field between them. This event may bring about changes which would gradually usher in a New Age. There might be a change in the atomi c structure . Every atomic power station would then cease to function, and even your electrical power would stop. But a new source of energy will then be available... ‘Your physical world would undergo a transformation – a cleansing of the Earth. Then the r esurrection would follow in the still of the night. This transformation would be almost instantaneous. Even the heavens would change color! Mankind will be afraid, but a great uplifting will follow. There will be regeneration; for example, those of 90 years age will be as 50, and those of you who are 50 will be as 30 . ‘Many would not see these changes. Only those of you who can now accept the new way of life will perceive it and experience it. Many are now being conditioned for that day... and also for cosmic flights, should that become necessary. Your subconscious mind is being conditioned to prepare for such an event, should it arise. Then, as if with the turning of a switch, true understanding would come. Some of you may become teachers or leaders..."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 60 Val dar also mentioned again the disturbance in the magnetic fields, which, although unobserved by astrono- mers on Earth, caused an insurmountable barrier to all magnetically propelled spacecraft. This disturbance came to an end on the 18 th of January 1981... ‘O nce the magnetic disturbance [of the December Solstice of 2012 occurs]... and the magnetic fields return to normal, then there could be a radical change on earth. When the changes come... and come they will, the rotational direction of Earth will be opposite what it is today. It would take the planet quite a while to readjust itself, but it will do so, for the earth is still a very young planet. These things happen to young planets! And they must happen before your sun becomes unstable and turns into a supern ova and burns everything out. But there are still many millions of Earth years before that event. ‘But then there is the possibility that Earth may turn into a ball of fire as the result of a nuclear war. However, I feel that these changes, some of whi ch I mentioned, will come before mankind on Earth can perform such a deed. Let us wait and see. There are still many things that even the Confederation is uncertain of. Changes can be observed and data analysed but only Mother Nature – the Divine One – will trigger the reaction that will change things permanently; I repeat permanently on Earth. ‘The reversal of rotation of the planet would also change the polarity of Earth. North would become South and the South pole would become North. This could be broug ht about by a natural or an accidental cause... Great ships from space will come... then truly the planet Earth will be at peace. Those who remain will know our love and friendship. They will understand what the stars have to offer them. All this will be given to them and many things will be revealed in the New Age... And this is why we keep contact with you, to bring you messages of peace and love. We have tried to bring you an understanding of our planets and our way of life, which will be to your benefit whe n this great change arrives... and this will affect the whole of the Universe – not only Earth. These things have not been planned by us; we are just passing the message to you.’ 17 Valdar’s clear statements elucidate dramatic future events and subsequent m ajor atmospheric changes involving the oncoming shift of Earth to high resonance. He foretells a ‘physical... transformation – a cleansing of the Earth... in the still of the night... [that] would be almost instantaneous. Even the heavens would change color!’ A great increase in the intensity of cosmic rays bombarding the Earth, from a nearby supernova event or chain of events, would re -engage the now -dormant pyramids to ignite an atmospheric HHO plasma canopy, with plumes arching along the pathways of Fibonacci standing waves."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 61 An astounding aerial HHO plasma phenomenon was photographed in detail on the auspicious date of 9/9/9 in Longview, Texas by motion -sensor game -trail cameras (above) 18 , providing recent, direct evidence of the atmospheric and electromagne tic changes described by Valdar over 40 years prior to this enigmatic time preceding the magnetic reversal of December 22, 2012. The ultraviolet -A and infrared spectra emitted by the ionizing plasma plumes, as well as the precise standing wave configuratio n of the luminous arcs, confirm the photographed phenomena to be a product of ultra -low frequency irradiation of water vapor, causing its combustion by energized particles as HHO gas near ground level. Atmospheric HHO plasma plumes and standing auroral pat terns may become an everyday aspect of Earth’s future. The inevitable result of high- energy atmospheric change will be the purification of the ambient light that penetrates many layers of HHO plasma to reach the ground, providing healing ultraviolet -A and infrared light to all terrestrial lifeforms. Just as demonstrated in HHO plasma beam healing devices like the Godlight cellular regeneration beam of Troy Hurtubise, 19 the atmospheric conditions will dramatically alter the life cycle of all living terrestria l creatures: ‘There will be regeneration; for example, those of 90 years age will be as 50, and those of you who are 50 will be as 30.’ The regenerative effect of the frequencies of light emitted by HHO plasma promotes the extreme longevity enjoyed by advanced space -traveling civilizations on their homeworlds, and also generated inside the cabins of their interstellar spacecraft. The highly resonant atmospheric purity of the planet Koldas affords a longevity that is significantly greater than that present ly experienced here on Earth, although the oncoming energy shift may soon restore Earth’s atmospheric purification processes, involving the plasma discharges of auroral activity and lightning strikes, that had become severely diminished over the preceding millennia:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 62 ‘Greetings... The message that I would like to leave with you this evening is, be patient, trust in us, for indeed you will realize that we can see a little further into the future than it is possible for you to do at this present moment. Tr ust in us and a new way of life, a new path, will be revealed to you, as the ancient prophets did in the past. Their monuments are still there today to be seen on your planet – the pyramids and the Sphinx... Other Superiors have governed Koldas, who have l ived to the age of an equivalent of 250 Earth years. They enjoyed the full benefits of life as I do. I have no ailments and that is as it should be, and that is how it will be for those who share our life philosophy. We are the instruments for the Divine L ove and Truth to manifest through. We are not Gods. Never think of us as such! There is one Divine Creator of all the heavens that you can see, and that we can see, and what lies beyond that again... I am Vax Noah... Salu kata katsu, farewell. ’ 20 This heartfelt message from the Superior of Koldas was transmitted from high above, among the stars where many things beyond Earthly vantage can be seen. The penetrating knowledge offered to us by the Confederation of Twelve Planets was seeded for germination dur ing the cosmic changes unfolding since the beginning of their contacts with Edwin in 1968. Present scientific understanding of enhanced cellular function under the influence of a mild electrical current, and under the high -energy conditions of plasma beam healing devices, allows the conceptual framework needed to grasp the truth of Valdar’s insights. As he well knows from similar events in the history of other binary star systems like our own, the cellular rejuvenation effect of HHO plasma will be induced b y the elevation of vast amounts of water into the atmosphere of Earth under the growing influence of an inaudible acoustic resonance. The greatly increased ambient atmospheric luminosity generated by a glowing auroral canopy of HHO plasma, in combination with increased infrasonic stimulation, will alter the expression of DNA in all living creatures on Earth. In the terrestrial human being, pineal gland stimulation will bring about significant changes in the range of visible light and audible sound perceived. Our eyesight and hearing will extend significantly, aligning with the greater capabilities of Koldasian sensory perception. This was referenced quite literally when Valdar explained ‘what we can see is more than you.’ Layers of meaning within the simpl e, profound statements of the Koldasian visitors continue to unfold: "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 63 ‘There might be a change in the atomic structure . Every atomic power station would then cease to function, and even your electrical power would stop. But a new source of energy will t hen be available.’ Indeed, the intense solar flare activity will send massive coronal ejections that will influence the ultra -low frequency resonance of Earth through interaction with the Giza pyramids, which transduce all solar energy into inaudible acous tic waves. This new source of energy which is ‘here for mankind to use on our planet’ refers to these resonant infrasound standing waves that will be dramatically increasing in strength during the events of December 22, 2012. But what unseen forces are causing this great shift? Valdar divulged the hidden presence of ‘Sola Kananda’, the brown star binary companion of our sun that returns once again from the direction of Cancer on its long elliptical orbit. Although the full timeline of predicted future even ts was explained to Edwin in detail, the public was only informed that preparations and conditioning contacts made by the Confederation on Earth are being conducted in case an emergency evacuation of Earth becomes necessary in the near future due to these cosmic changes: ‘Let me explain briefly the purpose of the plan. It is to save as many as possible in the event of a major catastrophe occurring on Earth. This might be a nuclear war or the collision with an asteroid or some other cosmic disaster involving Earth. This includes the approaching embryo sun, Sola Kananda...’ We first heard about Sola Kananda approaching our solar system in 1973... Sola Kananda means a ‘sun that has not yet flared or blazed’, we are told. It is approaching from the constellation o f Cancer. As our solar system enters deeper into its sphere of influence, changes in our planetary magnetic fields have from time to time been observed by the Confederation. 21 These changes have been comprehensively mapped as nonlinear effects of focus inf rasound standing waves that are increasing in intensity with solar flare activity. When considered in the context of the near approach of an invisible embryonic sun , one may infer that the ‘instantaneous resurrection’ of Earth is somehow intimately linked with the dramatic rebirth of the dormant brown dwarf star into a red dwarf :"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 64 ‘In the near future, with the passing of Sola Kananda, your planet will pass through a certain region in space on its journey around your sun. This region is a belt which Sola Kan anda has produced through space. This will bring about changes on your Earth. I am the one to inform you of... [these changes in great detail, which we cannot allow to be published]. This is why I am making this transmission. A great many changes will pro bably take place. Environmental changes on your planet will make your superiors and scientists look at space in a different light...’ 22 With the dramatic revelation of the nearby brown dwarf binary twin, and all the auroral activity at specific infrasound standing wave convergence points, Earthly scientists will recognize the nonlinear alternations of locations of vortical activity and the connected design purpose of the world’s pyramids. But before these revelatory events are to occur there will be a brief preceding period of darkness during the time our solar system will cross the Galactic Plane, which Valdar cleverly referred to as ‘the still of the night’. Maya spiritual Elder Don Alejandro Cirilo Perez Oxlaj (above) affirms this time of darkness m ay perhaps last for 30 to 70 hours during the Galactic Plane crossing – thereby suggesting that the solar corona may become extinguished during the period of magnetic reversal, as if entirely swallowed by sunspots: when “we will enter the central magnetic axis... we cannot see the rays of the sun. We are inside. Once the Earth re -emerges from the axis we will then be able to see the New Sun.” 23 The galactic magnetic fields and cosmic rays of infrasound that drive our sun into incandescence will likely diminish altogether during the Galactic Plane crossing. Valdar referred to this as ‘the complete break in the magnetic field’, causing a temporary extinguishing of the solar corona during the process of magnetic reversal of the entire solar system –the sun, the b rown dwarf binary twin star, and all of the orbiting planets. Mayan wisdom reveals the brief darkness will end dramatically in the bright flash of a synchronization ray emitted from the Galactic Central Sun , causing ‘nearly instantaneous regeneration’ fo r all living things as well as global auroras and the incandescence of the red dwarf star. Koldasian Elders speak literally, not figuratively, when stating Earth’s ‘scientists will look at space in a different light’ – through an atmospheric plasma canopy glowing red, as ‘even the heavens will change color!’ Wisdom teachings preserved in the Mayan ‘Pyramid of Fire Codex’ unequivocally state : ‘Come, reunite pilgrims, for the sky is in flames!’ 24 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 65 Valdar hinted at some future catastrophe and the changes tha t this event would bring with it. But he gave no due as to when this cataclysm or cosmic upheaval would take place as this was unknown even to the scientists of the Confederation. They are certain that it will occur as they have learned to interpret variou s signs in their long history of cosmic observations... The virgin lands where the ancient Atlanteans settled will one day be a haven for mankind again. For after the big change takes place, where there are now oceans, there will be land and where there is now land, there will be oceans. The continents of America, Africa, Asia and Europe will no longer be there. In their place will be these 'new' lands, now at the polar regions, and civilization will start again for we think your polar regions will not suffer in this big upheaval. They will remain more or less intact but the climate will change and the icecaps will melt. On the rest of Earth's surface there will be drastic changes! The present polar regions are even now being prepared, for they will be needed. You may have noticed that there is a lot of UFO activity there.’ 25 Indeed, a fascinating component of the preparations mentioned involve giant aerial plasma displays over major urban populations, most spectacularly witnessed by residents of the Chinese c ities of Dalian and Yantai in 2005; Tomsk, Russia in 2006; Trondelag, Norway in 2009 (photograph above); and over South Australia in 2010. 26 Such technological demonstrations of fourth -density plasma shake and arouse human consciousness to awaken for the long- awaited day when the humans of Earth fully accept the great offerings of cosmic visitors, as the time beckons when such help becomes increasingly necessary. Recognition of the wisdom teachings of cosmic observers allows the integration of new concepts for a more balanced awareness. The peaceful and wise Confederation of Twelve Planets is but one of innumerable cooperative networks of cosmic civilizations exploring the endless magnetic fields in search of knowledge, toward the ever -present call of Oneness. Spiritual adepts among this small planetary group attain an extended lifespan by means of the radiations of the same high -energy HHO plasma that will soon be witnessed throughout the skies of Earth. The dynamic shift of Earth resonance to a higher leve l follows a pattern of revelation that inevitably occurs during the ascendance of all young planets and all nascent civilizations, along the path toward collective consciousness and cosmic co -creation."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 66 References   1 van Vlierden C, Ed.

Eduard’s childhood contacts were made by an aged man named Sfath, while as a young adult he maintained contacts with a female cosmic visitor named Asket. Through his later years he maintained contacts with Quetzal, Semjase, her father Ptaah and many others. ‘Billy’ is a nickname Eduard received in Tehran during his long travels on foot through the Middle East and Asia Minor (seen at left, in 1980). Billy Meier has documented years of contacts and remarkable dialogs with visitors from the Pl ejares star system. He has also produced several 8mm documentary films of Plejaren spacecraft, or beamships as they are called. Meier has also produced several hundred high- quality photographs of extra - terr estrial spacecraft of many types – both from the g round and in the air, aboard the Plejaren spacecraft itself. The sheer breadth and diversity of highly advanced information and physical evidence provided by Meier concerning his contacts and cosmic travels with the Plejaren calls for the close attention and discernment of the human beings of Earth, who grow in awareness by the slow process of assimilation of knowledge. While many contactees have experienced transdimensional travel and orbited the Earth and her oceans, Meier is one of the few present -day humans who has time -traveled by hyperleaps through deep space with his cosmic friends and returned with photographs and scientific details that are undeniably valid. The most profound teachings that imbue Meier’s life’s work are the spiritual teachings he has received from the Plejaren and presented to humanity through his many books, now available in several languages. The simple and penetrating spiritual teachings of the Plejaren are now transmitted through the Semjase Silver Star Center in Hinterschmidtr üti, Switzerland, providing an opportunity for synchronized meditation practices with billions of advanced spiritual beings throughout the Confederation’s unified network of planets, who choose specific times for coordinated interplanetary peace meditation on a regular basis. The Confederation comprises a collective of diverse civilizations that remain deeply rooted in spiritual connection through their respective planets, providing a guiding influence on worlds in crucial phases of developmental shift, as is the present case of Earth. These spiritually and materially advanced visitors remind us that even they grow food in organic gardens, and maintain direct contact with nature by planting with the hands in the soil, in the creative intention of love. Plej aren wisdom finds guidance in the Laws of Creation, and encourages humanity to learn for ourselves through investigation, thoughtful reflection and the application of reason. In spiritual aid of the human beings of Earth, Billy confers their extensive spir itual knowledge and physical evidence in the form of photographs, films and even samples of exotic materials. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 69 Eduard’s space -traveling visitors explained their ancestral origin in the Lyra star system, before an ancient cosmic migration to the Plejare s star system, including the beautiful planet of Erra, which resides in a fourth -density space -time configuration about 80 light years beyond the Pleiades star cluster (above). The name Plejaren (‘play- yar -en’) means ‘Law of the Sevenfold’ , reflecting a pe netrating cognizance of Creational Law and the Truth of Spirit. Offerings of the Plejaren Elders on the physics of Spirit were balanced by comprehensive lessons on solar and astrophysics. Meier was informed that t he Sol system, outside the Milky Way, cons titutes something like an enclave because it floats as a single system far outside a spiral arm, moving at high -speed towards the Hercules star system. The distance from the Sol system to the middle of the galactic central sun is 35,002 light years, accord ing to Plejaren calculation. Spiritual demonstrations of Semjase’s intentional h ealing ability were given during various contact s when she rapidly restored Meier’s dwindling health by concentration alone. During the 50 th contact of April 6, 1976 Eduard’s broken ribs were mended in minutes by an electro -healing apparatus within Semjase’s beamship (opposite), extending natural mental capabilities through technological means. 1 The ability of the Plejaren visitors to predict all major events in Eduard’s life w as repeatedly demonstrated, and even the date and cause of his death were previewed and discussed with him in detail. Another definitive event in his life predicted by the Plejaren, for his psychological preparation, involved the loss of his left arm in a bus accident in Tehran in 1964. After the necessary amputation, Meier healed in conventional hospice and wisely refused a biotech prosthetic arm offered by his extraterrestrial friends, on the grounds that his safety would be compromised by the greed of ot her humans who would inevitably attempt to steal the advanced extraterrestrial biotechnology. In this, he has found the resounding truth of the spiritual lesson. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 70 "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 71 Rather than secretly enjoying the material benefits of his contacts, Eduard Meier instead disseminates the advanced spiritual teachings of the Plejaren Elders, inviting each Earthly human being to consider the truth of spirit. The path of inner seeking through meditation and reasoned thought has become the focus of FIGU, a conscious community that has co -founded the Semjase Silver Star Center. Serving primarily as a meditation center, the facility synchronizes the FIGU community for the development of telepathy by exposure to focused infrasound. From there, Eduard’s enduring teachings have rad iated their light: In truth, the Earth human lives a life that does not ever deserve the designation life , in the true sense... [for he] no longer knows of the strengths and possibilities that lie within him and are suppressed. The human's psyche has become a prisoner of the material, and the human's corporal nature hinders him from glimpsing more than only a weak shimmer of the true light. But certainly the day will come when the human will venture forward somewhat further than usual in his thoughts, and then still a little bit further, and further. Then the inner light will gleam in him and he catches, to start with, only a small and fleeting glimpse of his true essence. Indeed, then comes the point in time in which he becomes somewhat more aware of it, a nd then still somewhat more. So the light of truth with which, namely, he is one, with eternal life and with the eternal power of his essence, gradually comes on for him. This light then illuminates his entire psyche and takes possession of it. Awakened t hrough this new consciousness, the human holds the thoughts of this oneness firmly, and thereby now progressively lives in these thoughts, his life now flows in constant actualization of the oneness of the creational Being. And thus the terrestrial Earth human is transmuted into the human who is of Creation. Compared to the new life, the old one only deserves the name death , because ignorance and narrow -mindedness is like that. But this deadly life is no longer able to shackle the new human who, before, in the old life, in a certain sense, had actually been dead -a living corpse. (OM: The Book of Truth, 4 3:153,167- 177) 2 Knowledge of the inner dimensions of the human being inspires reflection on the endless gifts offered by the Creation, granting natural relief from the burden of the physical through the transcendence of spirit. The moral dilemma which now cripples Earthly consciousness, namely the role of psychopathy in politics, was solved naturally by the Plejaren science of biorhythmic healing by genetic enhancement through the tri -thalamic heartbeat entrainment during fetal development. 3 This advanced preventive infrasonic genetic technique also relieves the moral crisis of abortion, which is permitted by natural chemical methods using essential oils (like that of the Neem tree found here on Earth 4 ) within the first three weeks of pregnancy only, as “the time of the beginning heart activity coincides with the entrance of the spirit of the newly conceived human being, so on the 21 st day after conception.” 5 The determination of spirit in accordance with Creation propels the consciously seeking individual from within his/her deepening experience of the luminosity of his own being, as taught by Semjase during the 18 th contact of May 15, 1975: "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 72 I want to proceed with the teaching of the spirit, as it is the most important of all things... The experience reveals that the Creation is unending beauty, a beauty above all beauty, borderless, intensive happiness without end, wisdom, knowledge, ability, truth and abs olute determination. When that is recognized by the human then he leads every one of his joys instantly back to its origin, to the unending joy of Creation. Wherever he sees something beautiful, be it now a flower, an animal or a human, or something else , he thus brings it instantly into interconnectedness with the infinite beauty of Creation itself. Wherever the human sees cognition reach expression, in this or any form, in an impressive and exalted manner, then he knows that it has its roots in the endless cognition which is Creation. Wherever life stirs itself, be it even in the tiniest Being, in a creature, as, for example, the microbe, there, behind this life he glimpses the infinite, the eternal and the creational. Out of that he attempts to deepen a nd expand his understanding and feeling through which he contemplates the essence of the creational and its inseparable presence at any time and in any space in many kinds of ways in the daily life and experience. Creation exists in every human as a fr agment of himself. Once this thought has first deeply penetrated the human and become his experience, then any fear and all doubt in him disappear. If he knows that the Creation is all- knowing, and almighty then he gains in inner peace and security and is immune from stupid thoughts and wrong feelings. Repeated contemplation about the all -present, the truth, wisdom and the ability and knowledge of Creation as constantly eternal, as dignity and worth, allows the word and the designation Creation to become something very meaningful in the human – to something which calls forth transformations in the feelings and transformations in his manner of thinking. The more his intelligence is effective in this direction the more he gains radiating light, the more powe rful his personality would be and the more blessed his entire life and works would be. Again and again the human living in clarity of consciousness would produce in himself, anew, the strong perception that the Creational is far more real than his body's f eelings. This perception rules, without interruption, the human living in accordance with spirit. The creational grasps possession of his consciousness whereby his senses are full of peace, strength, joy, knowledge, wisdom, truth and hope. All measures that the normal human grasps in his material- intellectual thoughts in order to attain peace, happiness and strength always show themselves as deceitful, while the constant controlled -ness of the human who is living according to spirit would be pulsed through with the dynamic power of Creation. He who is a human living according to spirit is very dynamic in all things. He attempts, uninterruptedly, to reach his goal as quickly as possible. As long as he lives he would, in accordance with this, use the time fo r applying the creational ability with all the energy available to him. He would never allow this undertaking to be lost. Everything possible can happen in the course of time, yet his desire for the creational would never be extinguished in him. He can str ike hindrances in which he suddenly has no sense and taste any more for the necessary material things, yet he never loses the taste and sense for the creational because he knows that the Creation embodies the true Being."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 73 Only a human who fights hard for co nsciousness and spiritual goods and progress, for knowledge, truth, logic, wisdom and love harvests mighty fruit of a spiritual and consciousness kind, because they do not simply fall into his lap. First, before the first results would be obtained, it is required that the spiritual -intellectual manner of thinking must learn the path of creational thinking and recognize its absolute correctness and determination. Yet when these first results come about then the cognizant one steps onward with great steps and expands himself in spirit and consciousness to a factor of power. First, through this, already known facts, knowledge, truth, logic, wisdom and love would be self -evident, which first, however, must be gained through hard work. Indeed, the path does not end at this point, because further seeking, further searching, further development and further recognition lead into the borderless duration of time. Everything possible may happen in the course of time, and hold the human back from taking up deeds, yet th e human living according to spirit knows no borders and does not allow himself to be kept from his goals by any kind of events or bad future out- looks. For him the future already exists in the present, so it is that everything must be done here and now in order to reach the highest spiritual and consciousness state... Again and again he produces in himself the strong perception that something is there which gives him immeasurable power and makes him free from unreal assumptions; (it is) the truth of Creation. Always again and again the human produces in himself the strong perception that he finds, in the ocean of creational light, his wisdom, his knowledge, truth, logic and love, which for him first entirely enables the Being of life. The joy of the human who is turned towards Creation exists as a result of his reverence produced from the creational and Creation; (it is) this, in which he accepts the almighty will in the creational laws and turns the absolute determination of these laws to his own determina tion and practically employs them. He brings his dedication to the laws to expression through the learning and utilization of all spiritual and consciousness facts, but never through belief, assumptions, serving and humility. The only way to learn exists in the unremitting efforts and striving to obtain higher spiritual and consciousness cognitions and to bring the capabilities into application which have unfolded through this. Patience and endurance and the development of higher understanding, recognition and engagement of the cosmic and universal love, deepening of the spiritual and consciousness knowledge and ability, as well as the shutting -out of material -intellectual thought powers, like egoism, materialism, pride, envy, greed and jealousy and so fort h, are thereby of decisive significance, because only this guarantees the recognition and obedience to the creational laws... He who is a human living according to the spirit attempts constantly to maintain himself always, and under all circumstances, in th e vibrational realm of creational motions. Should these once, through some kind of influences, be in danger, then he calls on Creation in the highest power and thus protects himself in its highest vibrational power, from the negative. In this manner he pro ceeds so far along until the creational essence in him has produced the absolute determination of defense against the negative."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 74 [In his thoughts and his waters,] the human is always the bearer of some things. Many carry oppressive feelings in themselves, others grief, worries, problems... But he, who is a human living according to the spirit, is a bearer of the creational, of the spiritual... He immediately transforms even the most negative thoughts that come and want to destroy his spiritual -intellectual thou ghts, into creational power and wisdom. So he makes everything creational and carries it as a block of power in himself. Thereby he is a traveling temple of Creation. The intelligences of the human living according to Creation would be ever more inspi red and press always deeper into the spirit -consciousness. He who lives according to the spirit presses always deeper into all things with his cognitive abilities and grasps the warmth of the fire of the creational presence in everything. Thereby the spiritually thinking human would, over -all, be cognizant and conscious of the power and the truth of the creational presence. What therefore remains unrecognized by the everyday perception of the senses, [ –as cosmic infrasound –] would be spiritually -consciously perceived by the human living according to Creation... The material life on the Earth is like a passing game, an evaporating phenomenon, but behind it lies the eternal and timeless truth; the spirit of the creational presence and the reality of Creation. This creational reality carries in itself all riches and realms of the ability to do with wisdom. This is the remaining, the timeless constancy and imperishable. This is no game, rather the eternal and timeless truth and wisdom, knowledge, freedom, love, logic and ability, the relative perfection, the absolute determination... 6 The pristine clarity of Semjase’s spiritual teaching continually unfolds within the conscious listener, expressing the source of all joy in Truth and the oneness of Creation. The purit y of spirit and thought present in the Plejaren wisdom teachers reflects their physical purity, drinking the celestial waters of their resonant home planet of Erra. The comprehensive knowledge of this advanced cosmic culture directs their harmonious lifest yle to benefit from a collective consciousness and the telepathic abilities endowed by following the resonant life -path set forth by The Spirit. Dwelling within the field of heartbeat resonance, one enters into direct communication with the living instruments given to us by the Creator, to hear the joyful laughter and all -penetrating cosmic Om – the vital force of the human being engaged in the ‘synesthetic’ state of inspired conscious co -creation. While Eduard had been educated in the teachings of spirit since his earliest contacts with Semjase’s grandfather Sfath –at the age of five – comprehensive spirit teachings were offered in later contacts with Semjase, beginning on January 27, 1975. The contacts of the 1970s involved many lessons on the Truth of Spi rit, but also began a period of extensive photographic opportunities for material evidence."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 75 "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 76 At left is a montage created from Meier’s original February 27, 1975 photograph taken at Jacobsberg - Allenberg/Bettswil, Switzerland. Meier has even taken photogr aphs from inside Plejaren beamships in flight (below) . The blurring and tinting of the image is a result of special coatings used in the windows, likely comprised of quartz glass, which glow orange in our atmosphere. The resonant acoustic and electromagnet ic environment maintained inside the Plejaren beamships interferes heavily with the camera functions, often overexposing the film due to high -energy radiations or distorting images beyond recognition. Dozens of remarkable photos taken in space are marred b y significant focal problems. All of the photographs produced by Eduard Meier during his contacts were obtained by permission of the Plejaren, while certain sensitive areas were prohibited as subjects for documentation. Portraiture of the Plejaren vis itors was not permissible, nor was Meier allowed to photograph the interior of the beamships. Why do they not yet present themselves to the human beings of Earth openly? Semjase’s father, Ptaah, provided Billy with a concise answer to this question, reveal ing a profound understanding of the nature of human consciousness at the present time, and the primacy of reasoned thought and careful deliberation: Ptaah: When the epochs change, so also do the minds of the forms of life. This has also happened to huma ns now. The Age of Fishes was characterized by religious fanaticism... Then the birth pains of the Age of Aquarius began, and suddenly the Earth human started to listen inside of himself. And he started to think and to explore, and suddenly recognized logic only in truth. He developed in a short time his thinking abilities, and searched and explored... which is a characteristic of the Age of Aquarius. And this is one of the main reasons why certain human beings are now being contacted by extraterrestrial forms of life again. The present Age of Aquarius demands thinking and spiritual evolution of the humans of Earth. This cannot be achieved by seeing and listening with the physical organs only, but only by reasoned thought. If we appear officially in our beamship s and spacecraft, the effect of deliberation and of thought would suffer, because the Earth human, in his present state of evolution, does no longer deliberate and search that which he can see with his own eyes and hear with his ears. Beyond the seeing and hearing, the interest is short- lived, because that soon becomes a natural event to him, and he no longer cares. What he knows no more interests him. His interest is only aroused by secrets for which he can hunt. 7 "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 77 The Plejaren visitors always wore a prote ctive suit that Meier described as matching the texture and color of elephant skin, but was creased and folded to the exact forms of its wearer – perhaps some kind of organically grown material fit to form. Meier also described a reflective circular metal neck fitting with the apparent function of a helmet -mounting lock ring. The Plejaren go helmetless on Earth without exposing themselves to our polluted air, as this circular neck fitting is electrified to create a standing wave over the nose and mouth that purifies and sterilizes the air taken in. This apparatus protects the wearer from radioactive uranium dust in Earth’s atmosphere due to humanity’s seemingly insatiable lust for war. The low -resonance environment of Earth had long ago reduced human lifespans to the brief span of near 100 years. This limit on longevity to which terrestrial humans have all become accustomed is a drastic and direct result of the weak and offset magnetic field of the planet, corresponding low levels of infrasound resonance an d very high levels of deuterium (the heavy form of hydrogen) in our waters. Traces of heavy water pollute the waters of Earth and her surface- dwelling human popula- tions, yet the process of her cleansing and transformation into a pristine paradise already grows from seeds within the human heart that will require a quantum shift to high- resonance. The high - resonance environments of planets with atmospheres containing only light water , comprised exclusively of protium (being deuterium -free), engenders human lifespans of perhaps 1,000 years or more as enjoyed by the advanced Plejaren civilization. An enhanced and colorized image based on a self- portrait drawing by Semjase (at left) 8 captures the refined grace of her features at the age of 330 years, in 1975. Th e facial features, size and proportions of the Plejaren race are identical to that of Earthly human beings with the exception of their long, connected earlobes, which may have inspired an association with wisdom long ago (pg. 4): [Concerning lifespans, investigator Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens concluded as follows:] This 1,000 years average age for the [Plejaren] seems strangely coincidental, as that is the [Bible’s] reported age of Earth humans before the Great Flood, when the dense vapor envelope surroun ding the Earth came down in torrents everywhere for scores of days. Loss of the vapor envelope reduced the atmospheric protection of Earth’s creature species from the harsh [UV -B and UV -C] radiations of our sun, and the lifespans of all creatures decreased quite dramatically and rapidly to less than 100 years for humans, and vegetable and plant yields were reduced accordingly. Recalling the extraterrestrial’s statements that we are descendents of their ancestors when they were here long ago, our 1,000 -year biblical longevities take on new meaning. Loss of that atmospheric protection has shortened our lifespans to 1/10 th its former scale... An interesting observation made later on in the contacts by one of the extraterrestrials, describing a protective [HHO plasma] screen they use around their vehicles, and even around their person when out of their vehicles, indicated that they age in our atmosphere as much as we [terrestrial humans do] without their protective screen! 9 "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 78 The vital force of infrasound expresses itself much more intensely in the highly evolved atmospheric conditions on Erra, imbuing an extreme longevity and advanced consciousness among the Plejaren through psychoacoustic entrainment. Meier initiated a profound lesson during the 39 th contact of De cember 3, 1975 by pointing out the brevity of the human lifespan as a result of “the fact that the forces of thinking of each single human being are able to raise or lower the force of life of the fellow creatures”: Ptaah : Certainly, this question is of great importance... The age of every creature is shaped partly by the penetration of its outer forces by others of the same kind of forms of life. Because the thinking of a form of life in cooperation with spirit generates an extremely logical, that is Creation -accorded, force which is released as high- frequency radiations and oscillations, an immense force is generated which is able to influence everything. The Creation -accorded force penetrates all, truly into all, material forms of life and matter, and inf luences them according to their kind and form. Each form of life owns an, adapted to its spiritual level, age of living or time for living, thus as well with the human beings of Earth. In earliest times, when the human being of Earth was procreated here by his ancestors, his average age of life was 1,007 years of living, and as taught by his procreators, possessed an enormous spiritual level of knowledge and abilities. But unexpectedly rapidly, he fell into religions and their heresies, and by this lost true knowledge and the truth. He necessarily began to work against natural law, became a stranger to it, and lived under the bondage of self - created laws. This all together resulted in the loss of the high average span of life, which in a few thousands of years decreased ever more and settled at the twentieth part of its earlier time. In the beginning of the new epoch [of the Age of Aquarius] a change for the better once more marked itself, from which the average span of life slowly increases. The main rea son for this is to be found in the acknowledgement of the truth and connected spiritual direction. The more then that spiritual direction turns itself again towards the truth, the higher again develops the average span of life, because here, by this also, the altered genetic and other factors regulate themselves again, which in the course of millenniums had become wickedly influenced. The mass of Earth human beings moving in spiritual form is still relatively low, and in many cases only beginning to recogni ze the real truth, thus hitherto still no great progress could be achieved. But the more the Earth human being turns himself towards the real truth, the more does also increase his average span of life. Seen as a whole, every form of life is of important meaning, that is, in its thinking and the forces whereby released. Each thought radiates out as a great force and strikes the other creatures who attract these like magnets. According to their quality, negative or positive or balanced, they generate in th e receiving creatures kindred forces, under according effects... But by the heresies and other misguidance of religions, the Earth human being is mainly only able to unfold forces which destructively influence all forms of life. Such destructions are found in the injury to age, that is, the lowering of the average age. The greater the assembly of human beings, as for example in cities, the lower sinks the average age, because in such places immeasurable thought energy is released, and penetrates into the fellow creatures... But also all materiality suckles itself up on these destroying forces, and in this way falls to early destruction, as for example iron, which normally does not rust so fast as is the case on Earth. By this, each Earth human being is himself guilty for the early death of his fellow creature, consciously or unconsciously, when he thinks in uncontrolled form, and in this way releases uncontrollable destructive forces. If the Earth human being wants to think right and according to the Creation, then he must guide the course of his thinking neither in negative, nor in positive trails, because both are degenerations which create bad consequences, thus they are against the Creation. Right thinking declares itself by a balanced and natural manner of thinking, in which way life becomes procreated and maintained. 10 "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 79 These penetrating lessons generate a heightening of the spiritual resonance of those humans who can receive the lesson and attune their thoughts, feelings and actions accordingly. The voluntary effects of teachings of truth was precisely given by Semjase during the 91 st contact of November 17, 1977: Semjase: ...In result of your education and your knowledge, it is you, [Eduard]... who emits the highest radiations on the Earth... When for example e xists a lesson of the truth, then its radiation diffuses very quickly and very intensively. If now other living creatures find themselves the truth within this lesson, by which fact they themselves strive towards the truth, so they become liberated for the reception of the radiation [from the speaker of truth]... In consequence of this, the receivers of the radiation tune themselves inside of the subconscious for elaborating the lesson of truth towards its best inside of themselves, whereby they generate auto matically a relationship of themselves to the diffuser of the lessons and even to his place of stay. 11 The highly developed thought forces of Eduard Meier (above, 2010) were briefly demonstrated by focused intent in 1977, when he levitated a ½ ton oven across a short distance of several meters, and later that year demonstrated the heating and melting of several coins in his hands. 12 The real danger of oscillation interference was concisely addressed by Quetzal during the 97 th contact of December 28, 1977: Quetzal: The reason why we do not maintain connections in physical form with you Earth human beings, is as follows: The spheres of oscillations between the Earth human being and ourselves is basically so much different, expressed in forms of negative and positive, as of the balances, that it could have heavy consequences, if they would touch one another. Normally those oscillations of the human being reach up to 90 meters [or 295’], which is why care has to be taken, this distance does not fall below th at, thus that Earth human beings shall not come within this point of distance to us. Our oscillations are very highly sensitive, and react strongly to other oscillations, which penetrate towards our sphere of oscillations. In comparison to the Earth human being, we are standing very high within our total development, namely by about 3,500 years in advance of the Earth human being, for which reason as well our complete field of oscillations has become subtilized. When now oscillations of a much less sensible Earth human being would hit us, just that way, that Earth human and thus quite imbalanced and negative oscillations would penetrate into the field of our oscillations, then this would be equal to a very strong shocking of the structure of oscillations, resulting in a strong outer influence leading to a sudden uncontrolledness of reactions, thoughts and actions of ourselves, which at the same time release uncontrolled feelings of fear..."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 80 Normally we use, when we walk among Earth human beings, which doing yet is extremely rare, an instrument, which protects us from the lower Earth human radiations. But to do this was never necessary with you, because you are exempt from these oscillations because of all your knowledge and your balance, which equates with ours... These dangerous disturbances of oscillation structure are the main reason that we are not allowed to agree to physical contacts with the Earth human beings. Even in our telepathic, or just inspirational -impulsive contacts, we have to exercise extreme cauti on, as also reflected impulse radiations effect similar consequences. 13 Complete absorbance of radiated energies by the resonant metals of Plejaren spacecraft protects the visitors from the destructive thought forces of terrestrial humans, as with prote ctive gear worn when outside the craft. Without the technical mitigation of radiant energies, safe contact is nearly impossible. The HHO plasma screens of Plejaren beamships permit the viewing of invisible infrared atmospheric energy as ‘ion plumes’ like those recently reported over North America during geomagnetic storms. 14 An excerpt from the 38 th contact of November 13, 1975 concerns “energy bales... that circle the Earth at different distances and intervals” – according to the Fibonacci structure of infrasound standing waves: [Semjase explained that] through the dimension door it was possible to visit the Earth in its prehistoric past as well as in its later time when it has a thick white vapor envelope surrounding the globe... But what now about the dimensi on portal in the Devil’s Triangle? Can anyone see it? Semjase: With the eyes alone, it is not recognizable, but it is possible to make the [infrared] radiation visible... with the help of my ship. At present only two courses of radiation are visible from t his side of the Earth, while the third one is behind the Earth and thus cannot be seen from here... [Not only can you see it on the viewscreen, but] you can also see it from the windows, because the radiation becoming visible results from the radiation shiel d, which is [HHO plasma] spread from the whole ship. Now watch carefully, for the Earth... Meier: ...Girl, ...that is fantastic – I can see really two huge trails of radiation! Besides this, there are spheres and other things around the Earth. What do these mean? Semjase: Those are energy bales of different sorts and strengths. They circle the Earth at different distances and intervals, but are very important for the maintenance of Earth creatures. I am not allowed to explain more. 15 "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 81 The Fibonacci standing waves that comprise Earth’s resonant energy cocoon are artificially generated for the acoustic propulsion of spacecraft. A beamships’ alteration of the normal infrasound environment of Earth likewise alters the consciousness of human beings, potentially un dermining natural learning cycles: Semjase: ...[C]oncerning control of the gravitational forces... natural cosmic laws order a unitary and harmonic development in compass to all concerns of all levels able for evolution. This means that the spiritual as well as the material development proceed constantly in harmony with one another, and always complete one another by unison of the consequence in all matters. In the case of the mastering of gravity, the regulations of the laws are arranged in order, that prima ry is the spiritual evolution, of most decisive meaning, for the elaboration of technical means with the aim of mastering the gravitational forces. Here normally at first appears the exercise of spiritual forces in paralyzation of the forces of gravity, by which a human being is able to move weightless through space... [G]enerated by spiritual force state... a levitation process takes place. From the very primary side, this status is evoked within an unknown to the human being form, and just step -by- step, he le arns to master it and to control it suitably. When the human being has then learned to control these forces, and only then, the way is cleared for him, by this, to consider technical means and to build them. So the control of gravity consists in its first -primary form on the evolution of spirit and feelings, meaning that the told forces can physically be controlled just then when the human creature has delivered himself from the “weight” of the non - spiritual condition... Exceptions witness the standard, eve n if these exceptions cannot easily be recognized and proceed in a way which often does not come to appear. Such an exception does the Earth human being represent. Except for a few, he is still not able to master levitation, and nevertheless he is already able to see clearly a great amount in the field of gravity research. This exception consists of the confusing fact of a very rare misdevelopment, which basically has shifted the potential of parallelization of the spiritual and the material, by which the material"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 82 [aspect of awareness] has become overweighted and dominates the spiritual. So this means that the Earth human being has become governed by the material side, by which the evolution runs in this direction, while the spiritual steps badly injured be hind, as you yourself have once said. From that it appears that the technologies are more developed than the spiritual evolution. In this it has to be considered that especially since the year 1937 the strong influence of the new cosmic age have led this w rong burden of the material side in the whole world toward more gentle and harmonized courses, by which the differences between spiritual plenty and the material is no longer as strong as is generally thought. Many forms of spiritual direction have led t o spiritual recognitions of enormous meaning and value, which decisively appear in the development of technologies, and as an interesting fact, lead to success although the normal sequence of observance of the law was disturbed. But this can also be explained by, the otherwise newly gathered spiritual cognitions do nearly compensate for the lawful rule, which means, that in spite of barbarism the Earth human being has proceeded in both directions since 1937, and gets closer, though often unconsciously about this, and advances by the cosmic oscillations , rapidly towards the real evolution and begins to comply with it. This course of development can already be seen in the first days of entering the Waterman Age, in the 3 rd of February 1844, and during the foll owing time until the year 1937, when since the 3 rd of February the second half of transgression of time began to offer its powerful working, from which it can be said by great probability, that the temporal aim of Earth humanity in respect to his determina tion by evolution, will have been reached after a time of about 800 years. 16 This concise explanation concerning human control of the gravitational forces given by Semjase contains many profound truths, which reach to the core of the present predicament of our Earthly humankind. The Plejaren comprehension of the Creational Laws reveals the natural evolutionary process whereby each civilization overcomes all barriers to interstellar space -travel: from the cognition of an internal spiritual process of levitat ion involving resonant infrasound standing waves and water crystallization. The ancient Vedic spiritual practice of levitation was referred to as one of the great attainments. Known as ‘laghima’ in Sanskrit, it is understood as an internal electromagnetic force generated by infrasound standing waves that are transduced and focused by the piezoelectric human body into an enveloping antigravity field. Earth’s present -day scientists have learned to overcome the gravitational force using acoustic levitation, as an effect generated by the focusing of high -frequency acoustic waves into a concave resonator. Biophysicists have demonstrated the levitation of various insects, and even gone so far as to successfully complete the gestation cycle of a frog egg entirely within a levitating water droplet! 17 Just as concave resonators artificially generate the force of laghima in a beetle, an artificial gravity field is generated by Plejaren beamships for their levitation by acoustic resonance. While high -frequency oscill ations are used to levitate beetles in laboratory experiments (at left), interstellar spacecraft apply ultra- low frequencies for the acoustic generation of gravity. When describing the rebalancing of the evolutionary growth of spirit with the growth of tec hnical means, Semjase identifies changes in ‘cosmic oscillations’ as the underlying cause . The movement of our entire solar system into a highly energetic region of our galaxy is presently inducing the profound advancement in consciousness due to the relat ive increase of planetary infrasound resonance, effecting a dramatic rebalancing of the Earth’s very sensitive vibratory envelope. These cosmic oscillations are transduced on Earth by the world’s network of pyramids into a resonant field of infrasound stan ding waves that converge at focal points defined by the axis -symmetrical octagonal geometry of the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt. The Fibonacci -ordered distribution pattern of resonant infrasound focal points dictates the precise locations where human consc iousness becomes enhanced by the heightened ‘cosmic oscillations’ increasingly inundating the Earth since 1844, according to information provided to Meier. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 83 Several of Billy’s contacts occurred in Ober -Sätelleg, Switzerland, where he was able to photog raph Semjase’s beamship on March 8, 1975 (above). At this same location on July 7, 1980 Meier was simply instructed to record the acoustic resonance of Semjase’s beamship during a demonstration flight. 18 Meier took up a position below the low -hovering beamship, near the trees beyond the log piles, while his wife Kalliope, two of his children and several close friends also made recordings on the greenway about 488m away. Thorough analyses by acoustics experts confirm the beamship sounds to be genuine recordin gs that are impossible to replicate using any known equipment, being truly unique in three significant aspects: 1. There were at least thirty or more discrete frequencies in a random and constantly shifting mix that ranged from 4 to 2170 Hz, but varied on average between 470 and 1452 Hz. 2. The amplitude of these frequencies was also constantly changing, whereby the dominance alternated. 3. The wave shape was also constantly changing in a random, periodic rhythm that caused a characteristic beat. The wave pattern in the oscilloscope showed this constant and random shift in frequency, in which the principal waves of all frequencies came together in perfect synchronization at one moment, only to travel at the next moment in different directions and stages, thereby generating different patterns — at one moment seemingly moving in a cluster in one direction and, at the next moment, in the other direction. Then they gradually expanded until, for one moment, they formed a mutually precise and evenly distributed pattern, only then to move again into different relationships. Although these changes appeared to be random and were not repeated in a particular order, they always appeared in geometric relationship to one another. Two other sound engineers and a synthesizer sound specialist joined the analysis team, and the sounds were reexamined, this time for possible duplication. All of these specialists agreed that the character of the sounds was unique and that any type of synthesis, if in fact such was possible, coul d produce only portions of the recordings we had examined and that duplicating only part of the sounds, even in a short linear segment, would be impossible. The number of traveling and constantly shifting discrete frequencies and constantly changing amplit udes, which were shifting in relative dominance, exhibited duplication problems that exceed the abilities of a current state -of-the -art device!”"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 84 Normally, Meier does not hear such loud ship noises, certainly not for such a long time. At the most, there is usually a very short noise when the spaceship lands or takes off. This demonstration was intentionally given for the purpose of the tape recording... None of the other eyewitnesses saw any type of spaceship, but Meier said that he could see it from below an d observe a strange effect. As the sound went up on the scale, the ship became more transparent, and when the pitch became lower, it looked denser again ... Jim Dilettoso, our research consultant, took samples of this noise to Peter Gimer and Rick Coupland o f Micor in San Francisco. There they performed tests in the audible range, from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz. They found twenty -four characteristic frequencies within the audible range and eight outside of it. They found all thirty -two frequencies concurrently at diff erent amplitudes and volumes. All thirty -two tones are somehow produced simultaneously. In a time matrix, the amplitude of some frequencies increases, while that of others decreases. It was observed that the amplitude periodically increased by ca. fifty de cibels and then decreased by ca. forty, and at other times, just the opposite was the case, which produced the characteristic beat that was audible. Other normal sounds were audible on the recording, but there were no signs of a tone -on- tone tape dubbing. All frequencies were clear and stable, and they were regularly lined up along the frequency scale [in the sonogram, below]. The demodulation showed that one must be dealing with a rotating device — 249.6 U/min. modulated at 4.16 Hz... The high- speed device produced a sound that began at 520 Hz and increased in steps up to 990 Hz, only then to decrease again down to 520 Hz in the same frequency steps. The tonal groups comprising 520 Hz disappeared together at 520 Hz and reappeared at 600 Hz, only to d isappear again at 720 Hz. At 990 Hz, however, they reappeared and were very strong. The same occurred in the other direction. The condition remained stable for a moment and then shifted again. This shift was somehow random, but nevertheless constant. At ce rtain times, the high -speed device was still, and a deep, throbbing beat was audible; and then the high -speed rotation began again, and the sound increased rapidly to a high vibrating crescendo in the upper 50,000 U/min. range or higher. Simultaneously, the slower 249.6 U/min. -rotation again became audible. The vibration was produced by the high -speed rotation of approximately 29,000 U/min., which accelerated to over 59,000 U/min. This was most certainly not a normal sound! 19 While acoustic experts have id entified several key features of the beamship sounds that are impossible to reproduce with any known equipment, their archive search for related sounds failed to recognize these same key features in a sound that we are all constantly exposed to, but only v ery rarely conscious of – the sound of our mother Earth! The over 30 fixed frequencies of Semjase’s beamship, whirring in constantly shifting amplitudes, very closely replicate the much lower infrasound harmonies of Earth’s planetary resonance. Earth’s base frequency presently fluctuates near 7.8 Hz and harmonics progress in frequency steps of approximately 5.9 Hz, extending from below 2 Hz upwards to about 50 Hz. 20 Subtle fluctuations observed in the deep resonance of Earth are seen as rather dramatic shif ts in the multi -frequency oscillations of the Plejaren beamship, as dominance constantly shifts up and down the frequency scale in regular stepped intervals visible in the sonogram above. The various circular rings and domed elements of the beamships’ hull s are designed to generate this standing wave resonance through highly structured crystalline metals that transduce and amplify the omnipresent song of the cosmos, referred to by the Plejaren as the ‘Symphony of the Spheres’ during the 223 rd contact of May 1, 1988:"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 85 Meier: You, as well as Ptaah and Semjase, once played the strange humming sounds of the Earth to me through your apparatuses, which I can’t perceive in nature, unfortunately, because my hearing senses aren’t so sensitive that I could hear th ese sounds, which should very well be possible for other people, however, as you’ve explained... You named the sounds “Symphony of the Earth” or “Symphony of the Planets” as well as “Symphony of Space,” which is also entirely incorporated into these sounds, like also the atmospheres of planets and suns and even all material and immaterial things of every kind, concerning which you’ve spoken of a “Symphony of the Spheres.” This symphony, i.e. these sounds, are, so far, still unknown to the Earthly scientists i n particular and to the people in general, other than just the exceptions to the rule, even those people who perceive these humming sounds, i.e. “Symphony of the Earth,” and who are of the opinion that something isn’t right in their heads, and thus, not th at real things are going to and fro. Can you once again officially explain what it actually concerns with these humming sounds, if it shouldn’t remain a secret? Quetzal: It does not have to remain a secret because in about 10 to 15 years [1998 -2002], a portion of the Earthly sciences should also encounter these things. Moreover, it concerns the fact that every planet, every comet, every larger asteroid, meteor, and every sun, as well as the nebulae and clouds in space and space itself, as well as every bl ack hole and all material and immaterial things existing at all produce certain tones and sounds, which we, as you said, actually call Symphony. Within the entire realm of the Creation or of the Universe, nothing exists that would not be incorporated into these symphonies, so therefore, all material and immaterial things vibrationally generate certain tones and sounds and even symphonies, which usually cannot be perceived by the human ear because these move in too low or too high frequencies for this. Only through abnormal, degenerative, physiological changes can these sounds or symphonies be perceived by human life forms, whereby these then become effective in an extremely consciousness -impairing, nerve -racking, and psyche- damaging manner."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 86 The frequencies o f these symphonies or sounds reach into all levels, so thus, the lowest sounds, like humming sounds, as you say, are given as well as the highest whirring sounds and shimmering sounds, etc. As the frequencies are virtually countless in their number, these are also the sources of the sound symphonies, for these relate to all that exists of the material and immaterial. Thus, if one starts from the Earth, then these sound sources are, for example, the waters, in terms of the deep -sea movements as well as the m ovements of the waters of the lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, and springs. Even the roar of the waves, the small and mighty storms, the tectonic movements of the Earth’s interior, the bubbling of magma in the Earth, and the eruptions of the volcanoes belong to these, as well as the rain, hail, and the various layers of the atmosphere, which rub against each other, as well as the winds against the trees, grasses, flowers, houses, mountains, sand dunes and deserts, steppes, icebergs, glaciers, and surfaces of ice, as well as against windmills, wind turbines, ships, aircraft, rockets, missiles, and vehicles of all types, against land surfaces and everything else that materially exists. Also to be noted are the voices and sounds of humans and animals, insec ts, birds, and fish and any other water creatures. All sounds together form the actual “Symphony of the Planet,” as we call it. And as this happens in the purely material realm, so this also happens in any immaterial sphere in the entire Universe, each o f which also produces its own symphony, like also fog flowing on the Earth or nebulae existing in space and all other formations that are absolutely impossible to cite in their number because everything is so immeasurable that it could neither be grasped b y purely human understanding nor by technological possibilities of any kind. 21 Given as a precise description of cosmic resonance, the comprehensive explanation of the ‘Symphony of the Spheres’ provided by Quetzal penetrates to the unified vibratory essenc e of the cosmos. My own direct perception of the resonant symphony during deep meditative states formed the impetus for my years of study of infrasound standing waves. I discerned that the deep throbbing pulsation that fills my consciousness during the darkest hours of the night was induced by ayurvedic pyramids for heartbeat entrainment at specific nodal points around the globe where sacred ancient temples still exist, yet having suffered terrible cataclysm. The cosmic symphony is absorbed through the res onant metals of plasma beamships to be converted by interior HHO plasma chambers into ultraviolet -A and infrared light for all power needs. The over 30 distinct frequencies observed in the infrasonic bands of Earth’s resonant symphony are exactly replicate d by spacecraft for acoustic levitation on the arches of standing waves. Analyses of the resonant humming of the Plejaren beamships recorded by Billy Meier exactly echo hieroglyphic Sanskrit scripts on highly reflective silver -alloy metal debris recovered from the 1947 aerial disc crash near Roswell, New Mexico (pg. 31). Embossed text on an I -beam fragment reads: “workings of 30 resonances, female and male, 30 resonances whereby approaching the highest...” Meier’s beamship recordings prove the Roswell texts describe the 30 resonant frequencies of standing waves generated by plasma ships for both antigravitic propulsion and the maintenance of life onboard."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 87 Standing waves surround the beamship to act as waveguides for HHO gas that is emitted from the aerial antenna atop the craft into the energy streams, where it is ignited to form HHO plasma around the ship. Also called hydrino plasma, HHO plasma is defined as resonant- transfer plasma for its crystalline ability to transduce all received acoustic energy into re -emitted heat and light. All interstellar vessels achieve extreme acceleration by enveloping the spacecraft in HHO plasma to induce a set of transdimensional characteristics that includes superfluidity and frictionless passage through the atmosphere. Se mjase explained in basic terms that the screen “allows every interference to glide away, without... resistance.” 22 This same plasma technology has already been in use for many years now in the nose cones of US military aircraft. 23 Additional information was p rovide d to Meier regarding the use of plasma ‘distorter - screens’ enveloping Plejaren beamships that allow complete optical invisibility to the naked eye : [Earth human beings] are very simply not accustomed to close observing and viewing. On the other hand we protect our beamship against sight of any kind and they can’t see us. It is easy for us to protect our ships as we desire in a diameter of 500 meters, in whole or on parts, at one side, upwards or downwards, against sight by (use of) a distorter -s creen. When I allow you to photograph my ship from one side, then it is protected on all other sides against further observation by the distorter -screens, thus none uninvited are able to see it. 24 The beamships’ invisibility screen is generated from emitte d HHO gas produced by the resonant dissociation of water molecules at 13,563,688 Hz. The implosion of single hydrogen atoms (to become hydrinos) as HHO plasma 25 is achieved by the rapid ionization of emitted gold and silver nanoparticles, as indirectly desc ribed by Semjase during her 11 th contact with Eduard on April 15, 1975: “The antenna's conducting beam and the energy collecting beam appear as a fine line of energy over the beamship, while the regeneration radiation becomes visible beneath the ship in va rious hues... The energy only becomes used and regenerated again for the radiation drive... Our whole technology is aligned toward natural rectification, but not toward destruction.” Implosion was then addressed by Meier, “ I understand; the natural principle i s, thus, implosion and regeneration, rather than explosion and destruction. ” 26 "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 88 Meier observed an optical transparency effect of the gradual acoustic engagement of the ship’s HHO plasma protection screen, observing that “as the sound went up on the scale, the ship became more transparent, and when the pitch became lower, it looked denser again ...” A different transparency effect was mentioned on another occasion when, during the 31 st contact of July 17, 1975, Semjase explained: “You know that with our technology we have the ability to strain any materials by special radiation and cause those materials to be invisible to the naked eye. We can control this effect very exactly.” 27 This transparency beam technology was first created and described among our scienti sts by Canadian inventor Troy Hurtubise, who named his prototype beam device Angel Light. 28 An intense beam of X- ray light from krypton plasma generates the temporary effect of total optical transparency in all materials – a new state of matter to be techni cally described only later, in 2009, by Oxford University researchers: [A] short pulse from a laser \"knocked out\" a core electron from every aluminum atom in a sample without disrupting the metal’s crystalline structure... [The] high -powered synchrotron radiation generator produces extremely brief pulses of soft X -ray light... At such high intensities the aluminum turned transparent. 29 Plejaren beamships’ precise control of transparency induction using X- ray light beams was demonstrated for Meier on object s in Earth orbit and even inside the beamships themselves. The domed ceiling and 8 view -ports of the circular spacecraft are made transparent by this high -intensity illumination process, giving the optical effect of disappearing instantaneously to provide an unimpeded 360° panoramic view. Meier’s clear profile photograph of a landed beamship from 1975 reveals the structural features of the flight vehicle perfectly conform to the Fibonacci -ordered standing wave resonance patterns generated by the over 30 d iscreet frequencies resonating within the alloys of the hull during flight (opposite). During the 4 th contact of February 15, 1975, Semjase offered a comprehensive description of beamship propulsion drives, yet carefully substituted the word ‘beam’ for the more accurate scientific term ‘HHO plasma’, a technical concept apparently not authorized for use according to the Confederation’s High Council:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 89 Semjase: For traveling through cosmic space, a drive is necessary which surpasses the speed of light by mill ions of times. But this propulsion can only come into action once the speed of light has already been reached... This means then that a beamship needs two drives, first the normal which accelerates up to the speed of light, and then a second... which generates a million -fold, a billion -fold, the speed of light, thus the hyperspeed by which hyperspace is penetrated... So time and space collapse, and they become zero time and zero space. This means time and space cease to exist. And exactly by that, distances of nu merous light years are traversed in a fraction of a second, with no time lag... When, for example, we leave the Pleiades and need about 7 hours to get to Earth, then on our own planet, and on Earth, 7 hours pass. We need this long because we first have to fl y beyond the reach of the planets by normal propulsion, and only far out in space can we convert to hyperspeed. Back from hyperspace then, far outside your solar system, we convert to normal drive. We are never allowed to enter hyperspace too near to a pla net... I am only allowed to say this concerning propulsions; your scientists are already working on light -emitting drives. Light -emitting drives work for normal propulsion, and move the beamships near planets and until they are a safe distance away. Mei er: This is evident, but how is it possible for a beamship in the gravity of a planet, or in its atmosphere, to attain such great speed without glowing, or the passengers succumbing to the huge pressures? Semjase: This is very easy to explain, and also no secret any more to Earth humans, at least not the scientists; the beamship is surrounded by a protection -beam -girdle... [Thereby] anything contacting the screen [becomes] disintegrated or “flowed” away... [while the protective HHO plasma screen] also neutralizes the attractive force of a planet... The gravity of a planet is, besides this, not always the same, or of the same strength, owing to certain alternations which will be discovered by your scientists in a reasonable time. The beam -protective- screen dive rts the gravity and attractive forces, and the beamship in effect becomes a miniature planet which can travel at nearly light speed through any atmosphere without risk. As the gravity of a concerned planet does not influence the ship, the passengers feel normal and unburdened, as if they were on their planet itself, always under the premise that the planetary gravity is in accordance with their anatomical capabilities. In the beamship itself, the gravity of course is tuned to the passengers and is completel y controllable. When passengers on spacecraft from other worlds move in atmospheres alien to them, or on hostile planets with unbearable gravity, they use suits and other small transportable instruments which generate for that creature, the necessary beam - protection- screen for their particular ship and their particular requirement. 30 [Semjase continued her explanation of superluminal space travel during the 8 th contact, on March 18, 1975:] The turning -off of a time- dilation or time -shift needs but the pene tration of hyperspace, as I have already explained. The “jump” occurs very fast by momentary paralyzation of the protective screen under flash -like increased velocity, with the consequence of a flash -like increase in mass. This means that the initiation pr ocess runs so fast, that by the speed of certain processes, generated by the apparatus, matter is distorted within the millionth part of a second, and becomes fine -material form, which is able to pass hyperspace timelessly..."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 90 By this, at the same time, space and time are paralyzed and disappear, in consequence of which the ship already rematerializes itself at its destination place, as it is dematerialized at its place of departure. The whole process needs no longer than a millionth part of a second, thus also for creatures, passing hyperspace does not take alterations of any kind. When spaceships fly below the speed of light, this inevitably takes much time, which is always the case with newcomers to cosmic flight. First, they all do learn from experiences an d cognitions. Second, this space -traveling is very dangerous and leaves its purpose open to question. When spaceships reach hyperspeed without passing directly into hyperspace, then catastrophe for the ship and its passengers is assured... Speeds above that of light hold many dangers, when the barrier of hyperspace is not penetrated and made an ally. The dilation effect is only one of these dangers... Our forefathers, too, faced these problems, and went astray in space and time. The same does happen to other cr eatures, and in the same way. 31 The industrial development of antigravity technology on Earth followed Nikola Tesla’s 1899 discovery of standing waves, which led to the later development of the implosive hydrogen motor. Through the joint espionage effor ts of Nazi industrialists in both the US and Germany, Tesla’s secret transdimensional spacecraft designs were stolen by Hitler and quickly weaponized by enslaved Nazi/CIA scientists 32 : Viktor Schauberger was the actual designer and builder of this world’s first flying saucer motor, which was built for Nazi Germany in 1944. In view of this startling revelation one has to wonder where he obtained his revolu - tionary knowledge to construct such a device. He had discovered what he called an “implosion” principle, and invented a motor to take advantage of this new principle. The motor consumed only air and water and genera - ted light, heat, and thrust, as well as a diamagnetism which made lift possible through ”diamagnetic levitation”. 33 The dark truth of the Nazi assassination of Tesla after the theft of his designs was retold in 1995, during a deathbed confession by Hitler’s personal bodyguard and espionage agent Otto Skorzeny. Published by Erik Berman in 2003, Skorzeny confirmed that Tesla’s HHO plasma invisibil ity technology had been applied in both the Nazi flying discs and later in the US stealth aircraft. 34 Advances in Earth’s resonant spacecraft technologies continually occur as the expansive consciousness of humanity reaches toward the stars."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 91 In anticip ation of piloting a newly manufactured spacecraft from Erra to Earth for the first time, Semjase announced the deployment during the 48 th contact. Eduard was given the opportunity to photograph the new beamship on March 8, 1976, at Bachtelhornli - Unterbacht el (above). The new beamship displays a golden- colored alloy comprising the underside of the hull and along a band below the orange -tinted cupola windows. Both beamship models are 7 meters in diameter and share a similar hull design, with several significant differences. The latest design presents a more complex array of HHO gas -venting systems above the domed ceiling that replaces the aerial antenna employed in the previous model, as well as radial ridges that form a distinctive stepped contour along the g olden perimeter of the spacecraft. Semjase explained, “In the outer appearance only small differences appear. The greater novelty is the inside arrangements, which offer much more capability than is the case with my present ship. With the new one I have the ability to break through dimensions in two directions.” 35 Meier had previously described transdimensional hyperleaps through space and time during earlier contacts in his youth, as an instantaneous physical dematerialization from which arises a profou nd sense of cosmic Oneness : With the launching of the [time -travel] transmission a quite weird thing happened in the form that the entire surroundings of the ship slowly shimmered and then quite suddenly simply no longer existed. I also observed the same process in regard to myself, and in the moment of the \"jump\" it was, to me, actually as if I suddenly no longer corporally existed. Somehow I felt transferred into something which I sensed as being eternity itself and in which an indescribable silence and endless, calming peace and enormous love ruled... It was often for me as if I were raised up by being itself. 36 "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 92 While photographing the latest Plejaren spacecraft design for the first time (below), Meier witnessed the instantaneous appearance of two accompa nying spacecraft, later described as 4 -meter Explorer class unmanned reconnaissance vessels. HHO plasma excited in the air surrounding the beamship for instant optical invisibility can also be generated within the ship’s interior airspaces by rapidly ioniz ing the third - density lightwater vapor to become a fourth -density environment of HHO plasma. During his 31 st contact of July 17, 1975 Eduard Meier experienced fourth -density space -travel, by hyperleaps, covering vast distances to visit various inhabited worlds of the Universe . The remarkable details reported by Meier deserve serious contemplation – especially the state of consciousness experienced by all the passengers aboard the giant spherical ‘Great -Spacer’ during the seven minutes of dematerialization ‘in the eternity’ : Semjase: Earth humans still don't know very many things. But now we have to interrupt our conversation, because my father has finished his preparations for the great leap. And as I am already speaking of such, then I want to ask you something: In a few minutes, we will jump for seven minutes into the \"eternity\", as you call it. The feelings and sensations there are completely otherwise than in normal existence in material life. For that reason it is also not possible for us to receive your thoughts and feelings with proper concentration. In consequence of which neither I nor my father, nor any of us, could later repeat for you your feelings and thoughts, so that you could write them down. If you nevertheless wish to do this, then there is a chance on a technical basis... The booths, which you can see there, beside the screens, are equipped with all necessary means, to store up feelings and thoughts. The thought impulses received are stored in a special computer and can later, as may be desired, be repeated word for word from it. The helmet, formable and adaptable in size, which you see there, is equipped with very fine sondes and is as well covered by a special, fine- meshed net of sondes, which pick up every kind of energy and transforms it into impulses, which are then transmitted to the computer where they are registered and stored. The energy of thoughts and feelings is measured in very high values and can be received only through those instruments. The energies of feelings and thoughts exist only in very high frequency fields, or hyper -frequencies. To now be able to register your thoughts and feelings, it is necessary that you place yourself into the chair and lay the head under the helmet cap, which then will adapt itself automatically to your head..."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 93 Meier: At your service... (As Semjase explained to me, I quickly sit down inside one of the three booths, in the extremely comfortable chair. As soon as I have seated myself, the peculiar helmet moves over my head and sinks down silently. It is big enough that it closes around my whole head, and only leaves my face open, thus I can see and watch everything. But the helmet is not touching my head; only lying close around it, keeping about one and a half centimeters distance to the skull, as I can see when I place a forefinger between the helmet and the head. Now I am tense and expectant, for I wonder what is going to happen. Ptaah and Semjase manipulate the apparatus, and now I can see again how the fantastic heavens and stars change. In a fraction of a second they are nothing more than a whitish milky mass, a shining mass, as I have already seen in the other hyper - leaps. But now suddenly as well, this milky whitish shining is gone and there is darkness. But now what is this? Suddenly all is merging into a golden color, and now everything is like silver. But - my dear this glistening light, this beaming shining splendor! Everything is merged into glistening light - only the glistening light. It is stronger than all the suns of the Universe. .. Dear, oh dear, this glistening light, and it does not hurt the eyes! Dear, this must be eternity, the glistening light of the eternal... but see, there is nothing besides the eternity; man alive, how marvelous! Marvelous? Man alive, that is itself marve lous. Eternity and marvelousness are one and the same. Only why do I separate it? Why do I put the eternity into terms of time? Time does not exist, and the eternity is marvelous. Man, just what is this? This tranquility, this peace -- what is it? How could I have achieved this? Love, oh that deep all -encompassing love. Nothing is there, but love : wonderful, marvelous. Oh yes, I am, but I am not. Everything is so deep, and full of love. Of course, I am eternity, and I am inside of eternity. How could I ever forget this? Oh yes, I am a human being, how can I... why do I forget that? I am only a guest in eternity – and those loving voices, calling for me, from where is it coming? I can see nothing, only the glistening light, comforting. Who is calling me? I s ee nothing; man alive, I am nothing any more. I can't see myself. I am eternity, in the eternity. Oh, how is that, but I don't see with my eyes, still I see everything. And I am not listening with my ears, yet I hear everything. Yes, the love, how powerful it is, how immense, infinite and wonderful. Everything is love and splendor; why doesn't the human being understand this?... The calling comes out of the light. Is it the call of eternity? Oh how hard it is... to not think that I am only a guest in etern ity, that I am only a human being. How painful it is, this being a human. I do no more want to be. I want to remain here as eternity inside of eternity... this deep. Yes, I want to stay here. Never again do I want to return. Here is the existence, the real existence... How can I feel strange having to return to a material world? I belong here... Pain, why are you shaking me? What is it?) Semjase: Do you still not understand? Meier: I – Oh yes, of course! – Pitiful – very much pitiful – why have you brou ght me back here? Semjase: You want to joke, but we have all been inside the timelessness, and would all like to stay there. But we are not ready to stay, because we have to absolve the way of evolution step -by- step – as you also must do, dear friend. I know quite well, how painfully your heart aches now, as we all have experienced the same thing. But we have to adjust ourselves for that and do know, that under no circumstances or conditions are we allowed or able to remain, until we have reached that level of consciousness. I do regret very much that you feel disturbed inside, as I can see it on your face. But you will overcome it, because you can think about it realistically. For that reason we also took responsibility for this equipment...

What he experienced ‘in the eternity’ finds direct parallels with the impressio ns of other contactees who have transcended into fourth - density awareness. During transdimensional breakthrough, the third -density air environment maintained inside the spacecraft is instantaneously converted in to a fourth -density environment of HHO plasma , inducing a transcendent state in the human bein g through the radiations of gold and silver nanospheres among the trace elements conforming the atmospheric water vapor maintained within all beamships: Ptaah: You breathe here in this room... air... [that] is adjusted to the conditions of our homeworld, and is much more healthy and invigorating than that of Earth. The oxygen content is some values higher than on Earth, and also the compound of other elements is somewhat different... The different composition of t he air keeps us awake longer, and in need of less sleep than is the case on Earth. That is why you are not tired. 38 An elementally balanced atmospheric composition affects the bioelectrical enhancement of all cellular metabolic processes within the human b ody, greatly decreasing the need for physical sustenance, whereby Meier was sustained on one meal for over 90 hours. Open d isc ussion of bionanotechnology wa s precluded by the Plejaren, except once –by Quetzal during the 205 th contact of February 3, 1986: But in our civilizations, [disease] has no longer appeared for thousands of years... I want to explain as an exception and on my own responsibility. Above all, silver ion products – such as silver ion powder, silver ion jelly, or silver ion cream – are useful. For this, an application is required on the skin. 39 This hint from Quetzal addressed those few silver ion products available at that time in 1986, yet point directly toward the present advances of ayurvedic electro -medicine using gold and silver nano -colloids."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 95 Through these highly advanced transdimensional means, Plejaren spacecraft are able to not only hyperleap through space, but also through time. Meier was taken to visit Earth in various stages of her past and future to witness differing levels of gravity and the corresponding atmospheric conditions. On one occasion, Eduard was actually taken thousands of years into the past aboard Semjase’s beamship to visit himself in a previous incarnation and was informed that the same time -travel process ev en allows the potential for visiting one’s future incarnations, although this is rarely done. Throughout Eduard’s early years of contacts with the Plejaren Elders he was denied the opportunity to obtain detailed close- up photographs of their spectacular p lasma beamships, yet this prohibition was lifted during later contacts in 1981. Several opportunities were granted for Billy to document visits by a single -occupant 3.5 -meter reconnaissance beamship (above). Having no exposed windows, this compact plasma ship relies upon interior view -screens or, for direct viewing, the walls of the ship are made transparent by intense X -ray illumination. The many conjoined circular sections of the tiered hull are comprised of a highly reflective electroluminescent metal al loy that can be electronically tuned to emit any desired frequency of light. Infrared luminescence is used to ignite HHO gas for instantaneous plasma invisibility cloaking, referred to by the Plejaren as a ‘beamship protection screen’. Scores of superbly detailed documentary photographs of transdimensional spacecraft were taken by Meier in the parking lot of the Semjase Silver Star Center. Close comparison of the differences that appear in the configuration of Quetzal’s ship reveals controlled rotation of the large ring of spheres. Meier learned of the absorptive characteristics of the beamships and other similar interstellar spacecraft during the 150 th contact of October 10, 1981, in discussion with Quetzal regarding technical barriers to communication bet ween various civilizations operating plasma spacecraft in the vicinity of Earth: "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 96 No radio waves and no other kinds of vibrations are capable of penetrating into these aircraft because the outer hulls of each device absorb everything in terms of power sto rage for the ships’ propulsion and everything else. This means among other things that these aircraft are so designed that they absorb all waves of all frequencies and, therefore, all vibrations of all kinds for power storage, like also sunlight and everything else in terms of entering radiations, etc. But the moon light and the weak light of the stars are also absorbed and stored as power, together with many other things [comprising the Symphony of the Planet, especially terrestrial standing waves of infra sound resonance ], which are still unknown to the Earthly scientists. 40 All wavelengths of energy are absorbed into the craft and transduced into ultraviolet -A and infrared light inside HHO plasma chambers, formed by the conjoined rings of spherical reso nators. The rotating rings release plasma discharges that arc across the spark gap created between the two resonant spheres with gold- colored circular fittings. The noticeable warping of the image is an optical effect of the strong electromagnetic fields levitating the craft across the parking lot while it was being photographed, without landing. Along the outermost rim of the craft is a ring of 96 rubies that act as plasma beam emitters as HHO plasma becomes confined within the path of the infrared light b y an encircling electromagnetic field, just as recently defined by MIT researchers investigating superfluidity (Ketterle et al. 41 ). The single- occupant reconnaissance spacecraft displays many advanced features for the application of fourth -density HHO plas ma beam technologies that further confirm the validity of these photographs, which have been met with decades of sustained criticism despite being authenticated by experts. Many magnificent photographs taken at the Semjase Silver Star Center provide scale references by including foreground and background objects, allowing the size of the spacecraft to be accurately determined."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 97 The craft’s spherical resonators and compact circular hull serve in the production of standing acoustic waves that provide the antigravitic effect for flight by acoustic levitation. An array of 8 spheres is clustered at the top the craft, above a central row of 12 spheres and a wide lower row of 24 spheres – all of similar diameter. This 8 –12– 24 alignment of resonators presents the same quadrupolar geometric configuration observed of all of their spaceflight vehicles for generating Fibonacci -ordered standing waves composed of over 30 simultaneous, fixed frequencies with constantly shifting amplitudes (overlaid, above). The loud si nging of the resonant metals in flight can be shifted out of the audible range of human beings to be entirely imperceptible, utilizing deep, throbbing infrasound frequencies well below 20 Hz for levitation. The frequency of each spherical resonator is defi ned by wall thickness, not diameter, thereby allowing the specification of a unique frequency for each, as the high -speed rotation of the largest ring of resonators at 249.6 U/min. creates the 4.16 Hz modulation. Never having seen Meier’s photographs, acoustic analysts identified the object that produced the sounds as being composed of many spheres."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 98 Meier was able to document an interesting effect of electroluminescence generated by Quetzal’s beamship at nighttime from several perspectives, in a serie s of remarkable close- ups on August 5, 1981. Red light emitted by the normally silver- colored metal surfaces gives the ship a golden appearance. One image from the series captured the ship in a particular configuration not seen in any of Meier’s other photographs, with a reflective metallic viewing screen exposed by the retraction of a small protective sleeve (above).

The compact circular design of this int erstellar vessel reflects the same mathematical structure that guides the larger beamship designs, presenting the precise, unmistakable form of the Mandelbrot quaternion (at left). The octagonal symmetry of the Mandelbrot set defines the distribution patte rn of interconnected spherical resonators mounted in circular rows along the upper tiers in the 8– 12– 24 arrangement.

Recessed patterns are seen under the beamship’s outer flange and details of the lower hull’s concentric rings include a pair of circular fixtures and other c losed circular ports just barely visible (likely housing landing supports). The large, stepped central element terminates in a nearly hemispherical platform with an array of HHO plasma beam emitters, for which the ‘beamships’ have been named. Plejaren beam ships in Earth’s airspace maintain complete invisibility, yet special occasions presented themselves whereby members of the Meier’s community were able to witness and photograph various spacecraft and other associated aerial phenomena. While Semjase’s desc ription of global celebrations on her homeworld of Erra included immense, multicolored aerial HHO plasma displays by fleets of beamships, only modest demonstrations were made for Meier’s group. FIGU member and author Guido Moosebrugger was able to photog raph a nighttime aerial beamship demonstration on June 13, 1976 above Winkelriet/ Wetzikon (at left). The bright luminous display distinctly presents an array of infrared beams acting as guide paths for glowing orange columnar discharges of HHO plasma. Rat her than providing some form of thrust as would be expected in the context of plasma jets used in basic terrestrial rocket technology, the plasma beams can be used to target and incinerate objects below the ship, and to levitate objects upwards from very far below. This beam is often used for tasks such as collecting atmospheric, terrestrial or aquatic samples and specimens, as well as generating luminous aerial displays. Specific colors emitted by HHO plasma can be controlled by simple chemical additives being vented with the HHO gas, thereby forming plasma trails of banded colors in the wake of the plasma craft as it maneuvers aerially. "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 100 The circular bottom of the reconnaissance beamship houses a symmetric octagonal array of 24 plasma beam emitters arranged around a larger central element which vents HHO gas into the beam array to be ignited as HHO resonant -transfer plasma (above). Each of the plasma emitters contains a ruby for the generation of a beam of infrared light, precisely aimed by a short nozzle. The plasma emitters’ achieve a narrow range of rotary motion that allows all 24 beams to be focused on one central point several feet below the beamship, or independently into any other desired configuration. The alloyed nozzles focus an electromagnetic field that encircles the infrared beam, thereby confining the HHO plasma within the beam. These techniques for plasma beam focusing are now commonly used by plasma physicists, yet are rarely studied in the context of beam propagation over vast distances through the atmosphere. Well -known examples of resonant metal alloys formulated by Sanskrit -based Buddhist traditions in Asia include Tibetan singing bowls, comprised of 3 metals, and finer Bhutanese singing bowls rendered from 7 metals or more, known for highly resonant characteristics. While the singing bowls of Asia are comprised of a layered composite of various metals formed by hammering, the much more advanced resonant alloy production processes of Plejaren metallurgists involve the co -mingling of atoms in a composition unique to space -faring plasma ships, unlike any produced on Earth in modern times. Billy accepted several resonant metal samples as gifts from Asket, the products of her civilization, the Timars, who use similar advanced techniques of f requency resonance applied by the Plejaren, and indeed all cosmic travelers."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 101 The resonant metal alloys of transdimensional plasma ships are developed using precision multi -stage temperature and frequency programs that convert base metals into alloys (above) containing all of the precious metals, rare earth elements and trace amounts of every other element on the periodic table – many in crystallized or metallic states not yet conceived of by Earthly scientists . Polarization of the final products is achieved by the micro -layering of perpendicular grain patterns formed within the crystals. Semjase provided Meier with Plejaren beamship metal alloy samples of a 7- stage metal conversion process from lead into a copper -nickel -silver -gold alloy, also containing traces of every stable element in a smooth curve from the heaviest elements through the lightest gases. Many aspects of this complex process were discussed during the 45 th contact on February 25, 1976, in response to Meier’s direct request – “Quite simp ly, we would like to know what sort of metal you use for your beamships?” Semjase: This I can explain for you: We gain it from a process of conversion from lead. We extract this soft metal from many things, as for example lead -containing atmospheres from stars, from waters, from different plants, etc., as well as from the decay of different ore -stones of stars in destruction. By an, according to Earth understanding, very difficult process, we convert the lead substances we assembled into the soft metal lead, which we then change by further mechanical -chemical processes into a hard -metal form, which is much harder than your metal which you call steel. This still is unserviceable in this form for beamships, because it must be polarized by further processes o f conversion into a beamship -suited alloy of a special sort and character, about which I am not allowed to give details. The final product, which must have quite certain characteristics, consists of... a copper -nickel -silver alloy, which for certain of the b eamships also contains gold. Meier: Oh yes, thus an alloy which could be produced on Earth... You mentioned a lot of manners before, in ways in which you gain the lead. Here it has struck me that you have mentioned no word of an ore mining of Earth kind. I s this sort of obtaining ores not usual with you?"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 102 Semjase: Ore -mining or other mineral mining on a planet or another star is done by us only in extreme emergency, because this process is equal to the destruction of the star. A planet or another star is never exploited in the form as is done on Earth. What the Earth human being does by that is equal to the destruction of the planet. The first evil effects of this destruction came up on the Earth already some decades ago, and at the present time it is alrea dy experiencing the pains of the destruction itself. This is to understand the way that the Earth human being exploits his planet, and robs from it its fundamental life force when de deprives it of its oil, gas and the different ores. The effect of this is that the Earth suffers shifts inside, leading to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, because the Earth is slowly breaking down into itself. The same event is generated also by the construction of dams and similar formations, which cause, by the assembled masses of water, very dangerous shifts. The worst delusion the Earth human being is performing is his subterranean and below - surface experiments with atomic bombs, as well as those cruel deep subterranean explosion tests, which he declares are atomic bomb tests, but which in truth are much more dangerous. 42 The spiritual ethics of the Plejaren culture reflect a comprehensive understanding of planetary systems. All 7 stages of beamship metal production were related on the following day, during Meier’s 4 6 th contact, with an astounding explanation of the atomic transmutation of metals by controlled frequency resonance : Semjase: Here I also have brought you some metal, of three different working steps... The first working step absorbs the lead substances from the atmosphere and condenses them into pure lead. The second process distracts from the resultant metal all dangerous radiations. Then the lead is fed into heat -converters, which, without the addition of any other metals, converts the lead by several processes into the alloy. (Ed. - The metal specimens finally delivered to Meier, which they and we had analyzed, consisted of three of the seven states the metal goes through in production and refinement. We had samples of states 3, 4, and 5. The sample o f state 3 was mostly lead, with impurities. State 4 was nearly equal parts of silver, copper and lead. State 5 contained silver, copper, nickel, gold, magnesium and other trace elements. We lost our specimens in the hands of testing laboratories before we had finished our analysis. We found traces of stable rhenium and thulium in our specimen tested by Marcel Vogel in his laboratory in San Jose, California. Since our testing in 1979, scientists have found that the addition of rare earth elements like rhenium and thulium produce astound- ing properties in otherwise basic metals, such as superconductivity, superhardness and supermagnetism, etc.) "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 103 Meier: You mean that the lead becomes liquefied first, and in this step suffers the conversion? Semjase: Surely. There do all right exist direct possibilities for the alternation of stuff, but these possibilities are not given for us. But our scientists have already well achieved successes in experiment. For the present, however, we still convert the metals the old- fashioned way in heat- converters, and as said, this happens in seven different runs. The metal becomes liquified, like with you, in furnaces, to suffer then by distinct oscillations, an alternation, but just to a certain value, because of the different steps in working that are necessary. Each final product is then pushed by pressure through a cooling spiral, where then are generated the small figures, as you have then here before you. This process is repeated some times, while with each new process the value of the different metals increases and becomes the targeted alloy. The sixth working process then affects the complete alloy... The cooling spiral contains usual water, which we obtain especially for this process in a condensational manner... Meier: Th ank you. Still it is not evident to me how you then will work the metal, as neither at your beamship, not Ptaah’s huge [‘Great -Spacer’] box, could I recognize joints or seams, etc. And nothing is riveted as well. Semjase: For this purpose we use an instrument which you would call a welding apparatus. But it is based on oscillation techniques, which liquifies the metal in a cold state and lets it flow together, by which it is completely without seam and forms one single piece. So we also do not know grindi ng operations, as you do when you have to do welding work, and then have to grind away the seams to smooth it all. In this respect, you on Earth use a very dangerous operation. 43 While Earthly s cience achieved the liquification of metals using high -intensity ultrasound 44 decades ago, Semjase informs us that for thousands of years Plejaren metallurgists have been producing beamship alloys by subjecting molten metals to “distinct [atomic] oscillations of a certain value.” What are these particular resonant fre quencies that induce the alchemical transmutation of one element into another? The atomic physicists among Earth’s scientists have been making great strides in their understanding of low -energy nuclear transmutation – the most outspoken among them being D r. Jo se ph Champion of the Phonon Resonance Institute in St. George, Utah. 45 Dr. Champion’s work elucidates the atomic principles enabling several successful methods of atomic transmutation involving the production of precious metals: "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 104 Dimensional phonon r esonance occurs when the space occupied by one isotope is exactly the same as that of another isotope in its rest state [i.e. 25°C] . This event can only occur under the following two conditions: the ex - pansion of an isotope by heating, or the contraction o f an isotope by cooling. Due to the natural characteristics of elemental properties, this event is extremely rare and one can only force the event under select conditions. To determine the phonon resonance of an isotope, it is necessary to apply the follow ing formula: In the formation of Au (or other elements) from a dimensional reaction, the conversion will occur without excess energies or nuclear signatures... by heating Ag to a temperature of 43.2°C... To achieve maximum conversion of Ag to Au will depend on the dwell time at resonance temperature. To date, visible conversion of Ag to Au has taken as little as six hours, with 2% conversion taking up to 24 hours. The reaction is safe... [with] no toxicity. 46 Dr. Champion’s phonon resonance formula provides the resonant frequency of gold (Au) in its rest state as 38,931,841 Hz and the 107 Ag isotope of silver as 38,962,532 Hz (above). The relative proximity of the resonant frequencies of these two precious metals allows a low -energy atomic transmutat ion from 107 Ag to Au to occur near room temperature . However, silver isotope 109 Ag comprises 48.8% of all available silver bouillon and, unlike it’s sister isotope 107 Ag, is not so easily converted to Au. The conversion of 109 Ag into gold requires a more complex process using megahertz frequencies in conjunction with precision heating techniques. By the same means aluminum can be converted into silver when oscillating at a res onance of 38,950,565 Hz (at 276 °C) and will also convert into gold when dwelling at a resonance of 39,932,068 Hz (at 295 °C). After just a few days of dwell -time at resonance, atoms of the starting element have become informed with the resonant frequency of the target element in its rest state. The metal is then melted and rapidly cooled in distilled water to achieve the maximum conversion rate, just as in the procedures described by Semjase in 1976. The respective electron configurations of aluminum, silver, platinum and gold reveal the restructuring of electron orbital shells during transmutation: The addition of subatomic particles into atoms vibrating at resonance is facilitated by standing waves that act as pathways for the reconfiguration of electrons , protons and neutrons into a more densely packed arrangement. Just as acoustic standing waves can power wireless devices by transmitting electrical currents across otherwise nonconductive airspaces, standing microwave resonances induced within atoms allow subatomic particles to jump across otherwise impassable gaps in the atomic framework. Direct obse rvation of this resonant phenomenon of atomic transmutation will be made possible by the quantum stroboscope, which has already provided the first direct imaging of standing waves that comprise the structure of a single electron. A source metal like alumin um can thus be transmuted into silver and then gold as successive electron shells become filled, adding atomic weight in the process and significantly increasing the yield weight of the conversion with each stage of the complex process."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 105 Dr. Champion has i dentified a new class of intriguing natural metabolic processes 47 where atomic transmutation occurs as fungi ingest silver, thereby undergoing a pleomorphic change . Dry, active yeast is a cheap and readily available bread -making product that requires only w armth and water to thrive and reproduce in vast numbers. Common yeast species like Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce the silver - binding protein SSB -1 that enables the attachment of active yeast cells to available silver surfaces. 48 Ingestion of silver atoms by the round 2 -3 nm microbes causes their mutation into rod -shaped mutant microbes about 1 -2 nm in length (below). The budding yeast cells act as electron donors inducing the resonant transmutation of silver into gold, as 32 electrons, 32 protons and 57 ne utrons are accepted by 107 Ag silver atoms vibrating at a 38,931,841 Hz resonance with gold. This newly recognized metabolic process leaves nanoclusters of gold deposited on exposed silver binding sites, as further transmutation takes place within the bodies of the microbes whereby ingested silver is converted into gold nanorods. The rediscovery of biological transmutation in yeast species restores ancient metallurgical knowledge and informs a scientific reinterpretation of enigmatic passages from the B ible. Biblical accounts of the divine presence often refer to a sacred substance called manna, which was used in making holy items such as the ‘bread of life’ (or showbread) and the ‘living water’. However, this holy bread was not simply produced by a common baker. Instead, Moses commanded the goldsmith Bezaleel to prepare manna for the ‘Bread of the Presence of God’ – apparently using yeast to convert silver nanopowder into gold. Many unmistakable references preserved in the Book of Exodus confirm the biological process of atomic transmutation was used in the enrichment of food and water for the elevation of human consciousness. Advanced material and spiritual knowledge possessed by Moses is revealed in his demonstration that the presence of God is not conferred by gold idols, but by gold nanoparticles in sacred bread and water: When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned... He burnt the golden calf - melted it down, and then filed it to dust; and that the powder to which it was reduced might be taken notice of throughout the camp, he strewn it upon the water which they all drank of. He did this that it might appear that an idol is nothing in the world, he reduced this to atoms, that it might be as near nothing as could be.

The delicate threads of knowledge woven into Meier’s communications with the cosmic Plejaren culture have been published word -for- word for this very reason: to preserve for human contemplation their advanced scientific and spiritual teachings in pristine form. The penetrating truth of the Plejaren teachings has become all the more apparent as the frontiers of human knowledge expand toward recognition of natural law and co -creation using diverse natural micro- and macrocosmic processes. The manipulation of an atom’s diameter by temperature adjustment allows for nuclear transmutation from one element to another in a specific cascade sequence that determines the frequency programs used by Plejaren metallurgists to convert lead into a resonant copper -nickel - silver -gold alloy with trace amounts of every other stable element. The third, fourth and fifth -stage beamship metal samples we re submitted for microscopy analysis to Marcel Vogel, senior research scientist for IBM, who later confessed his amazement at what he observed under magnification: \"When I touched the oxide with a stainless steel probe, red streaks appeared and the oxide coating disappeared. I just touched the metal like that, and it started to deoxidize and become a pure metal. I have never seen a phenomenon like that before.\" Of another metal sample containing nearly every element in the periodic table, Vogel stated, \"Each pure element was bonded to each of the others, yet somehow retained its own identity.\" At 500X magnification thulium was revealed. \"Thulium exists [naturally] only in minute amounts. It is exceedingly expensive, far beyond platinum, and rare to come by . Someone would have to have an extensive metallurgical knowledge even to be aware of a composition of this type\", said Vogel. At 1600X Vogel said, \"A whole new world appears in the specimen. There are structures within structures - very unusual.\" At 2500X he found that the sample was, \"metal, but at the same time ... it is crystal!\" ...

Dr. Champion’s work inspires a reinterpretation of the results of various analyses conducte d by Marcel Vogel in 1979, which comprised the first modern scientific study of resonant metal alloys produced by the cascade process of atomic transmutation: All of the elements examined spectrographically had missing bands in their spectra which should have been there if they were normal atomic spectra. This indicated that the elements were put together in a very unusual way [easily distinguished] from normal Earth technology... [presenting elemental characteristics] beyond what one would consider an isotope... Basically this indicates a non -electrical cold fusion process of synthesis because there was no ash and no heat residue. Such a process is not known to Earth technology... Another unique feature of these elements was the almost perfectly uniform fall -off of lighter elements preceding that being studied in the spectrograph. There would be the primary in a high state of purity and then with no sec- ondary and no catalyst an absolutely uniform curve of all the lighter elements preceding that, even through the gases. It appears as though the desired metal was the result of a uniform buildup of density, particle by particle! Examination of a non -metallic part of the specimen using polarized light to emphasize certain bi -refringence revealed crystalline stru ctures, which are organized in spiral formations. Under 2000X scanning electron microscopy the six -sided face angles of the crystals were clearly revealed. A photomicrograph picture shot of this revealed unusual clarity indicating unusual conductivity of t he electrons illuminating the image. Ordinarily, if they were ordinary non -conducting crystals, like quartz, the electrons would accumulate rapidly on the points of the crystals and form a space charge obscuring the image. The conductivity was so efficient that sub -crystal structures inside the crystals could be actually seen – something unheard of before this. The electrical bonding between the basic crystal elements was so efficient that a clear view through the crystalline latticework revealed a spiral buildup of regularly spaced assembly with contact taking place at the ends of the sub- particles. There were no gas bubbles. If this were produced in a heat fusion process the picture would be entirely different and a greater mixing of elements would be expected... Still another micropart of the specimen consisted of pure silver –again with no secondary lines and no catalyst indication. The silver was also unusually conductive and it was smoothly bonded to a pure aluminum area that was unusually conductive also ... The following unique proper - ties encountered in examining this specimen make it exotic and very definitely point to an unearthly origin: • Unusual purity in state of metal examined... with no indication of catalyst or secondary spectrographic lines. • Un usual number of trace elements ranging from the primary heavy all the way up the scale density in a very uniform curve with no breaks or gaps up to the lightest gaseous elements. Again these lines all indicate the same high purity for each element. Scientists involved have never seen anything like this before. • Strange, very uniform grain pattern with a layer of horizontal grains sandwiched between layers of vertical grains again sandwiched between that and another horizontal grain, etc., in a tight 90° latticework. • One metal surface showed evidence of an extremely fine mechanical cut, possibly even by laser. [above] • Association of non -metallic crystals of strange structure and extremely high conductivity for the elements. • End -to-end formation of bond patterns in the crystal structure and the spiral assembly or stacking of the crystals in the non -metallic substance was unique. • Some form of non -electrolytic cold synthesis process is very definitely indicated. • There is some evidence that the synthesi s took place in a vacuum. 51 "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 109 These many unique and astounding characteristics of the resonant beamship metal samples – including superconductivity, superhardness and supermagnetism – are only attainable through the phonon resonance application of standing w aves for tuned atomic transmutation in a uniform build -up of density, particle by particle. The concept of standing waves was touched upon indirectly on many occasions during the Plejaren dialogs with Billy Meier, though the specific term itself was not di vulged, in a situation very similar to the treatment of another sensitive term: ‘HHO plasma’. Infrasound standing waves were mentioned in the context of “energy bales of different sorts and strengths... [that] circle the Earth at different distances and inte rvals, but are very important for the maintenance of Earth creatures” ( pg. 80). Semjase also indirectly referenced terrestrial standing waves when she informed Meier that “the gravity of a planet is... not always... of the same strength, owing to certain a lternations which will be discovered by your scientists in a reasonable time” (pg. 89). In fact , over 30 years elapsed before my completion of these standing wave maps in 2005, defining the specific Fibonacci ‘distances’ or ‘intervals’ underlying this essential pattern of infrasound resonance. The Int’l Bureau of Weights and Measures detected variations in Earth’s gravity field in 2007. 52 The diamagnetic metals that comprise their weights are presently displaying a measurable weight offset, although inaudible infrasonic effects of acoustic levitation were not recognized as the cause. This effect will inevitably increase in the future to reveal its inaudible source. The same standing wave maps that inform the significant fluctuations of gravity also inform th e latest discoveries of scientists imaging the subatomic realm. The structure of the electron was recorded for the first time in 2008, revealing the unmistakable scattering pattern of nonlinear standing waves, as precisely encoded by the quadratic formula [ z n+1 = z n 2 ] (above). Researchers in Sweden demonstrated an attosecond quantum stroboscope that releases individual electrons into the field of an infrared laser at exactly one electron per laser cycle to facilitate the imaging of coherent electron scattering that takes place. 53 Standing wave resonances comprising the electron are presented 3 -dimensionally (opposite), and are applied for infrasound antigravity propulsion by all space -traveling civilizations , using diverse mathematical languages, and employ ing entirely different operations. During the 248 th contact of February 3, 1994, Ptaah confirmed that the uniformity of universal laws determines that all mathematical and physics formulas applied by all sentient beings may find equivalence, differing only in the terms of expression:"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 110 With regard to mathematics, that 3 times 3 is 9, it is to be said, of course, that the result is right and is also consistent with our mathematics, but the form of our mathematics is fundamentally different to the terrestri al one...

But once they are converted, they yield the same values because universally, the mathematical and physical laws, etc. are uniform in their basic value and final value and, there fore, are one and the same, just with the difference that the various races, civilizations, and humanities of the various worlds throughout the vastness of the Universe call other forms of mathematics and other terms, etc. their own; consequently, they als o have other methods of calculation than what are common among the Earth people. Nevertheless, in mathematics, the basic value and final value yield the same results. 54 "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 111 The vast variety of cosmic and planetary conditions within the universe facilitates na tural learning environments of various types, each providing the necessary range of lessons and limitations for each developing life- form and each collective terrestrial civilization. Planets can be categorized by their respective levels of infrasound reso nance, with planets such as Earth presently residing at the lowest level of the scale, and planets such as Erra, in the Plejares star system, finding their place among the more highly developed worlds. As Earth presently progresses from the primary level o f consciousness lessons, the infrasound resonance of the planet is stimulated to a higher level of collective vibratory experience. Previously invisible forces will become visible to human eyes; subtle forces will become self -evident. Rainfall patterns a nd major fluctuations in river levels have been directly correlated with solar flare activity − through the stimulation of infrasound standing wave resonance, raising vast amounts of water into the atmosphere to fall as rain. Rows of water vapor plumes evaporating off the ocean were photographed off Laguna Beach, California 55 in 2009, while the long- term water flow -rates of the Parana River were perfectly matched with sunspot numbers 56 in 2010. So -called constants like gravitation and atomic decay rates vary significantly, and in accordance with the levels of incident infrasound radiation upon the tested materials. Thus, Earth’s infrasound resonance with the sun defines the increasingly noticeable fluctuations of gravitation, atmospheric evaporation, rainfall, and the decay rates of every atom comprising our world. Plejaren scientists precisely comprehend the relative conditions of various planets, having studied literally millions of different inhabitable and uninhabitable worlds, and this comprehensive kno wledge extends into the minute variations in the respective rates of decay of elements on each planet. Ptaah revealed as much to Meier during a conversation regarding the low -resonance of the present atmospheric conditions of Earth that “all materiality su ckles itself up on... and in this way falls to early destruction, as for example iron, which normally does not rust so fast as is the case on Earth .” (pg. 78) The significance of this short sentence can only be understood in the broader context of planetary infrasound resonance as it influences atomic decay. Physicists on Earth have only recently documented the correlation of notable fluctuations in the rate of decay in radioactive isotopes in the laboratory with solar flare activity: It's a mystery that pre sented itself unexpectedly: The radioactive decay of some elements sitting quietly in laboratories on Earth seemed to be influenced by activities inside the sun, 93 million miles away. Is this possible? Researchers from Stanford and Purdue University belie ve it is. But their explanation of how it happens opens the door to yet another mystery... There is even an outside chance that this unexpected effect is brought about by a previously unknown particle emitted by the sun. \"That would be truly remarkable,\" sai d Peter Sturrock, Stanford professor emeritus of applied physics and an expert on the inner workings of the sun. The story begins, in a sense, in classrooms around the world, where students are taught that the rate of decay of a specific radioactive mater ial is a constant. This concept is relied upon, for example, when anthropologists use carbon- 14 to date ancient artifacts... But that assumption was challenged in an unexpected way by a group of researchers from Purdue University... Ephraim Fischbach, a physic s professor at Purdue, was looking into the rate of radioactive decay of several isotopes as a possible source of random numbers generated without any human input... As the researchers pored through published data on specific isotopes, they found disagreement in the measured decay rates – odd for supposed physical constants."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 112 Checking data collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island and the Federal Physical and Technical Institute in Germany, they came across something even more surprising: long -term observation of the decay rate of silicon- 32 and radium -226 seemed to show a small seasonal variation. The decay rate was ever so slightly faster in winter than in summer... On Dec 13, 2006, the sun itself provided a crucial clue, when a solar fla re sent a stream of particles and radiation toward Earth. Purdue nuclear engineer Jere Jenkins, while measuring the decay rate of manganese - 54, a short -lived isotope used in medical diagnostics, noticed that the rate dropped slightly during the flare, a decrease that started about a day and a half before the flare. If this apparent relationship between flares and decay rates proves true, it could lead to a method of predicting solar flares prior to their occurrence, which could help prevent damage to sate llites and electric grids, as well as save the lives of astronauts in space. The decay -rate aberrations that Jenkins noticed occurred during the middle of the night in Indiana – meaning that something produced by the sun had traveled all the way through the Earth to reach Jenkins' detectors. What could the flare send forth that could have such an effect? Jenkins and Fischbach guessed that the culprits in this bit of decay -rate mischief were probably solar neutrinos, the almost weightless particles famou s for flying at almost the speed of light through the physical world – humans, rocks, oceans or planets – with virtually no interaction with anything... \"It doesn't make sense according to conventional ideas,\" Fischbach said. Jenkins whimsically added, \"What we're suggesting is that something that doesn't really interact with anything is changing something that can't be changed.\" \"It's an effect that no one yet understands,\" agreed Sturrock. \"Theorists are starting to say, 'What's going on?' But that's what the evidence points to. It's a challenge for the physicists and... the solar people too.\" 57 In fact, the subtle variations in atomic decay data are not an effect of neutrinos, but the direct result of measurable surges of localized infrasound resonance , just as in the case of the ‘aberrant’ fluctuations of planetary gravity fields and the patterns observed in the water flow rates of major rivers. The fundamental integrity of the measured radioactive isotopes is directly affected by the incident infrasound radiation. The decay rates measured by Jenkins at Purdue show a significant fluctuation specifically because of the location of his laboratory in relation to the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana (40.43°N 86.91°W) is 6,176 miles from Giza, a distance comprising 24.8% of the Earth’s mean circumference. Infrasound standing waves focused by the Great Pyramid into the central Indiana area not only alter decay rates in Purdue labs, but also levitate huge sandstone boulde rs into treetops in nearby Limon 58 and Yellowwood 59 Indiana State Parks at the 25.0% distance - in the same antigravity resonance process employed by the crystalline metals of interstellar Plejaren beamships."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 113 The invisible web of terrestrial infrasound s tanding waves that protectively encircles the planet becomes focused by the three Giza pyramids, and in the same way by the three -ringed hull of Semjase’s 7 -meter beamship. The complex designs of every Plejaren spacecraft are precisely configured to intera ct within the Fibonacci structure of standing waves to achieve highly efficient acoustic energy storing within the crystalline latticework of resonant alloys comprising the circular body. This same effect occurs in natural crystalline structures – in stone s . A remarkable photograph taken on July 19, 2009 by Gang Hao captures a special effect of acoustic resonance (above). 60 This giant boulder is estimated at 5m in diameter, which suggests a weight of several tons. The family never noticed it flying overhead while taking the photos, suggesting that the boulder was captured while slowly floating during an event of acoustic levitation, actually caused by solar flares transduced into infrasound by the Great Pyramid. The piezoelectric properties of quartz, the m ain constituent of the sandstone boulder, allows its levitation by focused infrasound standing waves. The internal reflection of the parallel faces of the quartz crystals allows the acoustic energy to be stored inside the stone. The build -up of vibratory energy within the quartz lattice creates an electromagnetic field reducing the stone's weight until it becomes entirely weightless, and then slowly levitates along the infrasound standing wave's arch. The source of the focused standing wave energy levitatin g these stones is the Orion pyramids at Giza, exactly 5,240 miles from Gushan (or Gunchangzhai), China ( 25.02°N 118.51°E). This distance is precisely 21.05% of the Earth's mean circumference of 24,8 92 miles. Gushan is also situated 1,245 miles from Angkor Wat - a resonant distance that is precisely 5.00% of the Earth's mean circumference. The whole number percent values of the site distances confirms the antigravity formula as applied. Evidently, t he quantum physics of standing wave resonance underlies all of the transdimensional Plejaren technologies, as standing wave resonance affects both the levitation of spacecraft and the ‘levitation’ of electrons, protons and neutrons through the atomic frame work. The provision of subatomic"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 114 particles allows low -energy nuclear change and the multi -staged production of precious metals and rare elements such as vanadium , thulium and rhenium. These exotic elements are costly to mine and only rarely find applicati on in human industry today, yet the advances of phonon resonance beckon a new era of harmonious human creativit y, promising to expand the reach of human consciousness by allowing interstellar flight and bringing an end to the destructive and dangerous prac tice of ore mining. The broad set of transdimensional capabilities of Plejaren beamships include time travel – affording their ability to preview future events. Billy Meier has published 100% accurate predictions of a multitude of major scientific discover ies and major world events – yet without having published any erroneous predictions : • 29th Contact, July 7, 1975, and 31st Contact, July 17, 1975: Contact involved specific information about Venus, unknown at the time, including composition of atmos pheric gases, surface temperatures, depth of clouds, wind speeds, atmospheric pressure, coloration, variation in terrain, etc... • 31st Contact, July 17, 1975: Semjase informed Meier that Mt Chimborazo, Ecuador, is the highest mountain on Earth [as measured from the center of the planet]... contrary to Meier's belief that it was Mt Everest... • 1978: In a Wasserman publication, Meier foretold the launch of a telescope at end of the 1980s that would make unfathomable discoveries in space, and wrote that an asteroi d would be discovered in the late 1980s to early 1990s; it would be named Toutatis, and may threaten Earth in September 2004... • 1978: In Existing Life in the Universe , Meier [described] 2 small planetary bodies outside Pluto's orbit... • 115th Contact, Octob er 19, 1978: Meier described existence [and composition] of Jupiter's rings [and moons]... • Jonestown massacre (Nov 18, 1978) , Overthrow of the Shah of Iran (Jan 1979) • Chinese invasion of North Vietnam (Feb –Mar 1979) , Iran Hostage Crisis (Nov 1979 –Jan 1 981) • Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (Dec 1979) , Terrorist attack on Iranian Embassy, London (Apr –May 1980) • Abdication of Queen Juliana of The Netherlands (Apr 1980) , Death of Tito of Yugoslavia (May 4, 1980) • Mount St. Helens eruption (May 18, 1980), Assassination of Indian PM Indira Gandhi (Oct 31, 1984) • 215th Contact, February 28, 1987: Known as the Henoch (or Enoch) Prophecies, this contact contained a forewarning of the destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) by terrorism, the series of worldwide wars that the US would subsequently launch, and mil itary actions involving Russia, China, France, Germany, Spain, England, Scandinavia and many other countries. 61 Repeated, accurate predictions of major world events, often years prior, proves Meier’s foreknowledge! He also received information from the Plej aren leader Ptaah regarding the dramatic events of December 22, 2012, as later disclosed during the 476 th contact of February 3, 2009 – on Eduard’s 72 nd birthday:"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 115 Meier: Regarding the Mayan calendar, [engraved as a sacred mandala in resonant piezoelectric stone, above,] it must be said that the year 2012 will bring a whole series of quite special events, and... our sun, will contribute to them, because on the sun's surface enormous eruptions will occur and solar storms are caused, which will be very intensive and will influence Earth's geomagnetic balance. The Earth's magnetic field can suffer very strong fluctuations through the very strong X -ray radiation falling down on it. And through such geomagnetic storms, power grids and all electronic appliances can collapse, thus also those in satellites, and the ISS can also suffer great damage or can even fail completely. Such solar storms can lead to enormous natural catastrophes, and in the worst case, to a polarity reversal of Earth's magnetic field... What also has to be said is that such solar storms form to a climax in an exact rhythm of eleven years, which is normal, but in the year 2012 it can happen in an extraordinary magnitude. Earth will come under a very strong bombardment of hard radiation, which can have a very negative effect on the Earth's ozone layer. Due to the entire resulting process, nitric oxides and acid rain can form worldwide , which may have bad and devastating effects on the entire plant world. The enormous solar eruptions can lead to further very strong climate changes and, with it, to immense droughts, bad weather, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, crop failures and, therefore, to even greater famines than have existed up to now. In addition to all this, the year 2012 brings other unpleasant events, such as a so far unknown, invisible, dark and huge space wanderer that is threatening from the fringe of our solar system and could wreak tremendous havoc on Earth. And if this should really occur, the fact of its existence would be openly proven starting with 2010 or 2011, if at all, because the possibility of a \"dark\" and, therefore, non- observable passage of the colossus is also possible. Aside from that, all kinds of unpleasant machinations regarding unpeace, worldwide heavy warlike acti ons, as well as increasing degeneracy and excessive human ways of behaviour are threatening for the year 2012..."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 116 Ptaah: You should not say more, because what you explained should be enough... Regarding the Mayan calendar, the 21 st of December 2012 represents the culmination of a star constellation [alignment] that only occurs around every 26,000 years. The Mayan calculations are assuming that Earth - on the 21 st of December 2012 - shall lie on an imaginary line that joins together the star [Betelgeuse,] above the left side of the constellation Orion with the Central Sun, [situated at] the centre of the Milky Way. The Sun meets the Milky Way at a location that is built by interstellar dust clouds, and is called the \"dark cleft of the Milky Way\" by the human beings of Earth. On the 21 st of December 2012, at nightfall of winter solstice, the Sun is directly in that cleft, and it is in such a position that the Milky Way covers the horizon in all positions all around. Thereby the optical impression is produced tha t the Milky Way would touch Earth all around and that the galaxy would lie directly on the Earth. On the whole that's the end product of the Mayan calendar recording. This should suffice, my friend. To say more would be too much, because it would only fost er the fear of the human beings of Earth, which should not be, however. So keep silent on all the further explanations that we have given you... 62 Through the tireless efforts of Eduard Meier, the wisdom traditions of the Plejaren culture reveal that th e ongoing Earth changes are a result of the Golden Radiation emitted from the Central Sun, which lies at the core of our Milky Way galaxy. This Central Sun is obscured from our direct view by the 'dark cleft of the Milky Way' (above). Specific details regarding these electromagnetic field changes now occurring on Earth are most intensely experienced at infrasound standing wave convergence points which are already destroying all electrical equipment, just as discussed by Meier and his Plejaren contacts. The electrical overload of modern technology is also being experienced on the International Space Station, in accordance with the information from Meier and echoed in Native American prophecies of the Hopi. Billy's brief mention of the 'invisible, dark and hu ge space wanderer' references the presence of a binary twin companion of our sun - a brown dwarf star that the Hopi prophecies describe as reigniting to be seen as a small red star known to them as the Purifier, which will be the sign of the Purification Day, when all life on Earth will be effected. The wave of energy described by the Plejaren as the Golden Radiation is the crucial factor linking these events involving the red supergiant star Betelgeuse with the Central Sun on December 22, 2012, as the wave of Golden Radiation passes through our Sol system. Another chaotic aspect of the near passage of the dark brown dwarf star is the disturbance it has already caused within the Oort Cloud, before it becomes reignited as the Red Purifier of Hopi Prophecy."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 117 The topic of the origin of comets within our solar system was addressed during the 150 th contact of October 10, 1981, concerning the nearby Dark Star and its cyclical dislodging of comets from the Oort Cloud accounting for 97% of cometary debris entering Ea rth’s vicinity. While the complete details of the close passage of the invisible brown dwarf binary twin of our visible Sun (referred to as a Dark Star) have been wisely withheld, the breaching of the Oort Cloud presently threatens all of Earthly humanity: Meier: In the coming years and decades, there will again appear frequent passages of comets, including those such as Halley's Comet, which can practically be observed in the sky... in broad daylight... [W]hen you took me in 1975 on the great journey, I s aw beyond our solar system and planetary system the immense belt of material of frozen acids, rocks... and lifeless planets; some were quite large. Like the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of Mars, this belt also moves around the Sun but very far outside of P luto’s orbit. At that time, you explained to me that celestial bodies of all kinds pass through this belt, such as Dark Stars and other space bodies, and that every now and then, smaller or larger bodies tear out from this belt and enter into another orb it around the Sun, which can then partly be observed as comets from the Earth and, thus, can be seen. If I remember correctly, you told me at that time that on the one hand, this belt was still widely unknown to the Earth people in its magnitude but... more would soon be discovered... Furthermore, you explained that this material belt consists of the remains of the formation of the solar system and of immigrated materials from space, etc. Now, I wonder how high the percentage of comets is that appears in our solar system and that arises from this material belt beyond Pluto’s orbit ? Quetzal: It has probably escaped your attention, but this belt was discovered in the meantime and is named ‘Oort,’ after a Dutch astronomer. In accordance with its discovery, the discovered belt is called the Oort Cloud in Earth’s scientific circles, but that’s about it because the connections of this belt to the comets of the Sol system are still, to my knowledge, foreign and unknown to the Earth scientists. But the truth is that about 97% of the SOL system comets originate from this belt, as in this belt, planetary bodies passing by upset the trajectories of the materials through their attractive forces, so then these suddenly scramble, which removes isolated larger and smaller o bjects, pushing them into new orbits around the solar system, where they then appear as comets, while others fly out far from the Sun into free space in order to disappear somewhere in the vastness of the universe, often referred to as migrant dark planets , which will partly be captured again by major stars as satellites and then orbit them, far away from the new mother stars. But others will rush uncontrollably as dark objects traveling through space. 63 "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 118 Studies informing the link between Oort comets and a dark binary twin 64 have been published by U . of Louisiana researchers 65 and the Binary Research Institute , 66 and subsequently reconfirmed in 2010 . 67 The rain of Oort comets has already begun to impact the Earth on a daily basis. Smaller fragments are creating dramatic aerial explosions worldwide, as witnessed over South Sulawesi, Indonesia on October 8, 2009. Sizable craters attest to large impacts in Hidalgo, Mexico on February 10, 2010; San Joaquin (Santander), Colombia on September 6, 2010; and San Bruno, Ca lifornia on September 9, 2010. The prophetic date of December 22, 2012 was indirectly addressed during the 52 nd contact of May 17, 1976, in connection with precise astronomical calculations decisive in the building of the Giza pyramids about 73,350 years ago (spanning two cycles of 36, 650 years, as Ptaah later explained in the 256 th contact 68 ): Semjase: When the pyramids were built, the then astronomers had already calculated the further fate of the Earth. The measurements of the pyramids were elaborate d according to their calculations... [which] revealed that many thousands of years in the future, a catastrophe would menace the Earth and that from the cosmos, like at the time of the construction of the pyramids. To reveal to the later inhabitants of the E arth over the later millennia... the measured dates in astronomical form were built into the pyramids for the far distant future... when the catastrophe from the cosmos threatens anew. The ancient astronomy was very able, and... even considered in their calculat ions, several world crashes, and could reckon the dates with very exact precision. As pre -calculated, the Earth did then convert, and agreed with the then and since long gone science. Now slowly the time becomes mature, that the astronomically measured d ates, which as mentioned, served in the construction of the pyramids and were decisive in this, agrees with the astronomical values of the present, and announce the more than 70,000 years ago prophesied events this way. And this event will be exactly then, when the solar light of a very far distant star, a central star, falls through the tube -like Opening of Revelation, which draws itsel f from the outside of the Giza p yramid into the center, in a straight uninterrupted line, and illuminates one certain poin t. I am not allowed to tell more about this. 69 Many insights can be gleaned from Semjase’s foretelling of the activation of the Great Pyramid by the radiations of the galactic Central Sun, and the catastrophic impacts of Oort comets dislodged by the Dark Star’s passage. The Giza pyramids were masterfully designed for repeated reactivations by cyclical blast waves that radiate from the core of the galaxy to impact Earth in a precisely calculated rhythm, causing the magnetic reversal of the entire Sol system and a dramatic increase in terrestrial infrasound levels. Worldwide auroras can thereby be expected, as well as increased evaporation and precipitation rates globally, and a measurable reduction in the atomic decay rates of all Earthly matter. All cosmic s igns point toward the imminent reemergence of a ‘thick white vapor envelope surrounding the globe’. Earthly astronomy can no longer ignore the nearby presence of the brown dwarf binary twin of our sun. Nor can corporate news continue to hide or dismiss t he multitudes of reported meteor strikes now inundating the Earth, exactly as foretold by Eduard Meier and his knowledgeable informants decades ago. The existing corporate and religious institutionalization of psychopathy cannot withstand the great revelations occurring at the present time, and will soon lose its despotic hold of human consciousness:"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 119 Ptaah: When hitherto Semjase only spoke of Earth religions in negative form, then it was because the Earth human had to be made attentive to the error in his religions, ...for these are like nowhere else in this Universe... They control the Earth human and the whole planet, and retard your world thousands of years, in Spiritual respect... [Y]our religions still contain real worth, but this becomes so indiscernible that only few people are able to see the effective truth there. These few who are able to see the real truths from the scripts, are banned and confounded by those dependent on these wrong beliefs, and thus cannot spread the truth. When Semjase speaks in n egative form about Earth religions, she is addressing the falsifications in them which have been built up partly consciously. The Earth religions are only called such in name, but are just degenerate cults.\" In truth, the same small minority of fallible psychopathic individuals control world religions, economics, sciences and politics –those engaged in the destructive subterranean nuclear blasts, damming of waters and extraction of oils– are themselves also actively inducing earthquakes using the HAARP arr ay to terrorize and extort the rest of humanity. Awareness of the hereditary genetic disorder that results in psychopathic behavior demands responsible action from the conscious human beings of Earth. The holistic teac hings of Plejaren Elders reveal that genetic enhancement through biorhythmic entrainment holds the highest potential for the reversal of all known mis - developments of the physical body or the spirit. Natural law provides for the bioelectrification and illumination of the body’s waters, usin g golden celestial water comprised of pure protium in conjunction with tri -thalamic heartbeat entrainment during fetal development and throughout life, thereby removing all negative influences from the crystallized human being: Quetzal: [T]he fallible on es could be completely cured of their criminal or other degenerate forms through genetic manipulation and be released into society. This gene -manipulative healing method was further investigated and further developed [by Plejaren biophysicists many thousan ds of years ago], and indeed, even in reference to all hereditary diseases and immunodeficiencies as well as physical and organic deformities, but also in terms of disorders of consciousness and inheritable psychological disorders, etc. The development progressed rapidly, so already soon, early detections of gene damages of the aforementioned kind became possible, which naturally led to the fact that these cognitions were used and the genetic deformities, genetic abnormalities, and other harmful genetic inf luences were already repaired in the growing child in the womb. Thus, an irrefutable law has been in force since then, namely that every child, so every girl and every boy, is to be arranged into a gene examination, i.e. a gene analysis, at the prenatal age of seven months. Since then, since this law gained validity and became observed absolutely, it is valid with us that every crime or other degeneration as well as every inheritable disease of the body and its organs, every immunodeficiency of any kind, a nd every form of harmful aggressiveness, jealousy, and vindictiveness are just as non -existent as also hatred, envy, desire for validity, egoism, and many other characteristics that bring the human being discord, unkindness, and other harms. But at the same time, it should be noted that through this, our own decision in all matters and concerns is in no way impaired, as well as not our drive for self -preservation and our drive for self - defense, when this is demanded. 70 Until the coming times when this biorhythmic genetic healing becomes active through the world’s infrasound network of resonant pyramids, the survival of humanity requires our careful discernment of psychopathy in human leadership. The Prophecies of Henoch, forewarning of the dire consequences of human ignorance on Earth, were presented by Quetzal during the 215 th contact on February 28, 1987: "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 120 Quetzal: Before I give you a clear account of the prophecies of Henoch, I would like to point out that prophecies are always changeable and can be changed for the better if man makes positive changes in his thoughts, feelings and actions, leading to that which is better and positively progressive... However, this does not apply to predictions, as these rest upon events that cannot be changed, are inevitab le and surely and definitely will occur in the future. Predictions rest upon a preview and thus on a direct viewing of the future, and have to do with neither prophecy nor with calculation of probability. So when I make a portion of Henoch's prophecies for the third millennium known to you, it does not mean that they have to be fulfilled, because the prerequisite of fulfillment in each case would be that the already existing causes continue to exist as also continue to be created in the future so that a ful fillment of the prophecies can come to pass. Thus, provided that human beings of Earth will become reasonable, the possibility exists that by a reasonable change in the way of thinking as well as a reasonable development in feeling and an equally reasona ble way of acting, everything changes for the better and positive, whereby prophecies do not have to be fulfilled. However, if this transformation does not occur, a very evil, wicked and negative time lies ahead for the Earth and its entire population in the coming new millennium... The point in time at which these prophecies will begin to be fulfilled will be when a Pope will no longer reside in Rome. All of Europe will then fall victim to a terrible punishment by evil powers. The Christian religion wil l collapse and the churches and monasteries will end up in ruins and ashes... Monstrous forces will be created by science and will be released by the military forces and armies as well as by terrorists, causing great destruction. Millions and even billions o f people will be killed by acts of terrorism, by wars and civil wars; and finally, in some parts of the world, every third human being, and, in other places, every fourth human being, will lose his or her life. The nations of the East will rise against the nations of the West, the West against the East... The people will be completely powerless against all this and will live through 888 days of Hell on Earth, suffering hunger and plagues, which will claim even more lives than the war itself. The time will be severe as never before experienced on Earth. Ultimately, nothing can be bought or sold any longer. All provisions will be rationed; and if a human being steals even a small piece of bread, he/she will have to pay for it with his/her life... And it will be that the fanatics of Islam will rise up against the countries of Europe and all will shake and quiver. Everything in the West will be destroyed; England will be conquered and thrown down to the lowest level of misery. And the fanatics and warriors of Islam will retain their power for a long time. However, not only Europe will be affected but ultimately all the countries and peoples of the Earth, as the great horror expands to a war that will encompass the entire world. After the turn of the millennium, t he papacy will exist only a short period. Pope John Paul II is the third from last in this position. After him, only one additional pontificate will follow [Pope Benedict]. Then a Pontifex Maximus follows who will be known as Petrus Romanus. Under his reli gious rule, the end of the Catholic Church will come, a total collapse becoming inevitable. That will be the beginning of the worst catastrophe that will ever have befallen the human beings and the Earth... 71 "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 121 These profound passages form only a portion of th e Prophecies of Henoch, and follow from earlier information about the lineage of popes provided to Meier on August 6, 1978 during the 113 th contact: Karol Wojtyla... is the 3rd to last pope before the world change [of December 22, 2012]. He is the 264th p ope. He will die in the near future. The world will be astonished when the next pope [Joseph Ratzinger] is killed also. Then the pope with the number value of five [is coronated]. He is the 266th pope - he is the last one. 72 After the murder of Pope Bene dict XVI, “a Pontifex Maximus follows who will be known as Petrus Romanus. Under his religious rule, the end of the Catholic Church will come, a total collapse becoming inevitable.” These very detailed, ancient prophecies from the Henoch lineage directly c oincide with those attributed to St. Malachy, an Irish monk who produced a comprehensive list in the year 1139 which prophesied every future pontiff of the Papal lineage from that date until today. St. Malachy wrote: “In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church there will reign Petrus Romanus, who will feed his flock among many tribulations; after which the seven- hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people.” Not only is the same name given for a proclaimed ‘final Pope’, but the destruction of Rome, the ‘seven -hilled city’ is also given as a sign of the imminence of the collapse of the Roman Catholic Church. The Henoch prophecies foretell that “the point in time at which these prophecies will begin to be fulfilled will be when a Pope will no longer reside in Rome.” These foretold events will follow a pattern of fulfillment due to dramatic infrasonic surges that require the imminent evacuation of Rome and the Vatican, which will inevitably be overcome by recurring spates o f piezoelectric fires, just as documented in the towns of Messina, Sicily, near the active Mt. Etna volcano. 73 The Vatican (41.53°N 12.30°E in white, above) is 1,326 miles from Giza, Egypt – a distance that is 5.3% of the Earth’s mean circumference – along the radial distance of infrasound standing wave convergence. The steadily growing intensity of planetary infrasound is already significantly affecting these fixed focal points, including both the location of the Vatican and the Semjase Silver Star Center. Infrasound waves have been recorded in the atmosphere above Switzerland that reveal an inaudible ultra -low frequency field of concentric circles, as documented during an infrasound resonance event on April 24, 2009: "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 122 Did a country -sized UFO hover above Switzerland last month? On the morning of Friday the 24 th of April of this year employees at MeteoSwiss [observed] huge circular fields hovering over Switzerland... [that] covered the entire country... MeteoSwiss claimed... that they were merely caused by the re flection of water droplets. A few minutes after being queried on the issue the radar images were hurriedly removed from the department’s website. Are we being told everything the Swiss meteorological knows about these radar images? 74 Meteorologists in Sw itzerland have never seen radar anomalies like this specifically because they are hidden and scrubbed from archives, as in this particular case. Hundreds of similar radar anomalies are documented by websites that gather the data before it's purged from onl ine archives. The only viable explanation for these giant radar rings is water vapor suspended by concentric rings of standing waves in the ultra -low frequency range. Nikola Tesla was the first to scientifically describe standing waves in his Colorado Spri ngs lab 75 , later reporting: “In Colorado I succeeded one day in precipitating a dense fog. There was a mist outside, but when I turned on the current the cloud in the laboratory became so dense that when the hand was held only a few inches from the face it could not be seen.” 76 The standing waves that fogged -out Tesla’s laboratory are now suspending these giant concentric circular rings of water vapor above the entire country of Switzerland – as on April 24, 2009. A circumference of the Earth taken along the northwest/southeast axis of the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt passes exactly through the center point of the MeteoSwiss radar circles. The center point of these gigantic radar circles lies just southwest of the Semjase Silver Star Center (overlaid in red , above) in Hinterschmidrüti, Switzerland (47.416°N 8.906°E); both sites being located along the 6.7% resonant distance of about 1,680 miles from Giza. This precise resonant alignment of the Semjase spiritual center in Switzerland reflects the same advance d understanding of the Fibonacci geometry of infrasound standing waves that informs the locations of all of the ancient pyramids of the world, now approaching the time of reactivation with the magnetic reversal of December 22, 2012. The meticulous work of Eduard Meier to record his extensive contacts with the Plejaren civilization guides humanity by the light of Truth, reorienting our consciousness toward the radiant lessons of the Creation witnessed within ourselves and our mother Earth during this time of the great shift."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 123 References   1 Stevens WC Ed.

Most significant among the many extraterrestrial contacts occurring in South American regions are those reported by Urandir Oliveira, who very carefully documents many forms of evidence attesting to the veracity of his statements and the reality of his transdimensional experiences. The weight of Urandir’s evidence takes the form of demonstrations of the strong magnetic influence that he directs through his hands to move objects, in addition to physical trace evidence and video recordings of his levitation along violet-colored transport beams into luminous aerial plasma ships floating above. At Urandir’s special request, Verade TV videographers recorded and broadcast high-quality footage of his 1998 plasma beam transport into one of six disc-shaped plasma craft in an arc, each radiating pure white light. Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira was born on March 14, 1963 in Maraba Paulista , a rural area outside Sao Paulo in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He clearly states that his unusual experiences with highly advanc ed extraterrestrial beings have involved their purposeful electromagnetic activation of bioenergetic capabilities that lie dormant in the average person. At a young age, Urandir had noticed the influence of his emotional states on metal objects in his hands. He quickly learned to develop this skill over the years, eventually being able to bend and tear common coins with his bare fingers. While he does not recall any physical interactions with the cosmic visitors during early childhood, he does attribute his unusual electromagnetic abilities to artificial plasma environments that he was voluntarily exposed to. The first face- to-face meeting that Oliveira recalls occurred on March 6, 1976, at the age of 13, when he was transported from his Sao Paolo home aboard a luminous lens-shaped craft. There he met with several tall, blond-haired humans of about 6’3”-6’5” in height, who radiated love, peace and intelligence through cat-like eyes, with vertically-oriented luminous golden pupils enclosed by blue, green or yellow irises. The enhanced mental capabilities endowed by Oliveira’s visitors allowed his further development of telepathic communication with the beings at a distance, by which method they would request and prepare him for subsequent contacts. The elect ro-acoustic activation of various Earth humans was explained to be a crucial mission of this extraterrestrial group, comprised of several allied races for whom Urandir has been given no names or planetary origins, but only recognizes their personalities telepathically. The practical urgency of Urandir’s contacts involve the provision of crucial information regarding the electromagnetic changes now occurring on Earth, to prevent disastrous consequences that include the destruction of all nuclear power stations and nuclear arms storage facilities by the electrical overload and superheating of metals at specific focal points of infrasound resonance. Several contacts were conducted over many years to prepare Urandir for the complex astronomical information he would later receive: "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 127 By age eight, Urandir realized that when he fought over food with his brothers and sisters at the kitchen table, his hands could bend and twist the metal utensils. He remembers once throwing a fork that kept bending as it hit the table top... Urandir recalls physical abductions from Earth locations into an extraterrestrial craft when he was 13, 23, 27, 35 and 39, plus an encounter in Sao Paulo with ET humanoids at age 23. Age 13, March 6, 1976 - Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction #1, Sao Paulo When he was thirteen on March 6, 1976, at 10pm at his home in Sao Paulo, he had his first encounter with a craft. The beings were tall and blond-haired. Their eyes were like a cat's, vertical honey-colored pupils in blue, green or yellow irises. He understood that the frequency of his mind had been speeded up by the blond humanoids to improve communication. Since then, one of the consequences has been that Urandir Oliveira's mind control over matter resembles the powers of metal bender, Uri Geller, who linked his abilities to a childhood encounter with a glowing being. Age 23, 1986 - Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Encounter in Sao Paulo Urandir had been making money by entertaining people with his mental powers in Sao Paulo. Then one night, he came upon a beggar and child who were hit by a car and broken bones were exposed through their skin. Not knowing how or why, he bent down and placed his hands on their terrible wounds and the bleeding stopped. Shortly thereafter, tall blond beings approached him and said, 'Now you know what to do with the light energy.' Age 27, 1990 - Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction #2, Sao Paulo In 1990, he and a friend were both lifted up in beams of light into a craft where Urandir remembers many crystals pulsating with light and ‘lightning.’ He understood that the pulsating crystals ‘activated human force fields.’"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 128 Age 35, 1998 - Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction #3, Corguinho Farm In 1996, Urandir bought 209 acres of farmland in Corguinho between hills and a mesa where local farmers for decades have seen mysterious lights and aerial craft. His parents and in-laws also moved to the farm to help with the work. Over the next couple of years, Urandir appeared on several Brazilian television programs to demonstrate his Uri Geller-like ability to use his mind to bend metal, shut off and turn on lights, to move and control the direction of a small metal ball and to mentally break metal coins and glass dishes. By 1998, Brazil Verade TV traveled to his Corguinho farm because Urandir informed the station that the blond beings were coming back to get him again. The crew was videotaping when six lights in an arc appeared in the night sky and descended toward the ground. As the arc of lights seemed to lower toward Urandir, he walked through them into a small beam of light that lifted him into a disc-shaped craft while the Brazil Verade television camera rolled. Some of that video was broadcast in Brazil and the tape was sent to CNN for international broadcast. But to date, Urandir does not think CNN ever aired any of it and he wonders what happened to that professional videotape of his second abduction. What no camera had access to was the inside of the craft. There, tall, blond humanoids showed Urandir wall screens containing moving images of Earth destruction by nuclear missiles and nuclear power reactors. Urandir understood that the destructions will be caused by changing Earth magnetic fields which affect the electronic systems in the missiles and reactors. The blond beings also showed Urandir that three \"fully functional\" pyramids currently covered by sand will be uncovered for the world to see. Age 39, September 15, 2002 - Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction #4, Corguinho Farm His fourth abduction encounter began after 7 p.m. local time on September 15, 2002, in the bedroom he and his wife, Jessica, shared in their farm house. Urandir said he had received telepathic information several days before from the beings that by 10 p.m. on September 15, another transport to a humanoid craft would occur. So, anticipating another interaction, Urandir told his parents and in-laws, as well as local friends, to be ready for \"a rain of rocks\" that would last for seven minutes when Urandir was taken to the non-human craft. That same week, Jessica had traveled with their 2- year -old son, Aria, to Sao Paulo, to visit family and was not there when the drama unfolded. 1 The natural energy fields of Earth resonance are notably strong in the entire Corguinho area, one indicator of which can be easily observed in the red soil that is given its color by iron, just as is the case with our own blood. The high electrical conductivity of iron in the blood is also witnessed in iron-rich soils, which conduct ambient electrical currents in the ground transduced by the bedrock from deep, inaudible pulsations of infrasound standing waves. Oliveira’s earlier extraterrestrial experiences in the city of Sao Paulo prepared him for the later development of a spiritually and ecologically conscious community within which Urandir would be able to spread the knowledge and experiences he had gained from his contacts. 2 The electromagnetic setting of the Corguinho area provides the optimal environment for telepathy. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 129 As with many conscious individuals seeking a sustainable life-path in accordance with ancient indigenous wisdom concerning these times of great change, Urandir and his wife Jessica have chosen to relocate to a resonant location to begin a sustainable organic farming community. Just as in the case of Eduard Meier and the FIGU community in Switzerland, Urandir Oliveira has founded Project Portal at his family- owned Ecovila Fezenda organic farm. Both communities engage in the sharing of extraterrestrial spiritual teachings concerning meditation, telekinesis, levitation, telepathy and the oncoming Earth changes. Quadratic mapping of infrasound standing wave patterns reveals the Rochedo area of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul as a resonant convergence point. The Oliveiras’ 209 -acre farm (19.88°S 54.95°W) is 6,669 miles from Giza, or 26.79% of the Earth’s mean circumference. It is 1,365 miles from Nazca, Peru –a resonant circumference distance of 5.5%. The nearby giant rock formation, for which the town of Ro chedo (“Little Rock”) gets its name, is an ancient geological sign of convergent infrasound (opposite). The holistic vision and profoundly transformative consciousness that is being engendered through these communities has apparently been perceived as a threat to the US government policy of UFO secrecy and denial, resulting in repeated attacks of all kinds. Both FIGU and Project Portal have been branded ‘cults’ and libelously slandered and legally attacked by so-called ‘UFO groups’ that are nothing more than US government propaganda fronts. Both Eduard Meier and Urandir Oliveira have received numerous death threats and both have evaded assassination attempts. Oliveira was also harassed, arrested and briefly imprisoned in March of 2000 on false and absurd charges aimed at destroying Project Portal. These detractions have been unsuccessful due to the open nature of Project Portal’s workshops and events , bringing hundreds of people to the eco-village every year for spiritual and psychic development. 3 "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 130 Looming majestically over green fields and forests is Morro Ashtar, an oblong plateau that has become the center of increasing aerial activity. Continually unfolding telepathic interactions, luminous plasma ships, and very bright but completely silent aerial explosions suggest to some residents that a subterranean base exists below the plateau. Many Corguinho residents have spoken publicly about their numerous and regular sightings, and in some cases have also reported direct conscious interactions with extraterrestrial beings. One such case involving ongoing contacts has been reported by Mr. João, a 72 year-old lawyer from Rio de Janeiro living in the Corguinho area. 4 An intriguing aspect of the experiences of Mr. João involve loud booming and humming noises emitted by the invisible plasma ship of the visitors to raise his electro- acoustic vibratory field, during which time they continually asked about his perception of colors presented from the luminous craft. Success was achieved after Mr. João was asked to put his hands on the ground, as his shoes had apparently prevented the energetic activation they were undertaking! While videotaped group experiences involving interactions with plasma craft do exist, other such events in the Corguinho area have gone largely unreported. Documentary video was recorded by Fabricio da Silva during Urandir’s experience aboard the fourth-density plasma ship on the night of September 15, 2002, including footage of a ‘rain of stones’ falling from the sky during the initial beam levitation event. 5 Also included in the video document is an interview with Urandir Oliveira by science reporter Linda Moulton Howe from February 9, 2003, at his farmhouse, conducted with Portugese- to-English translation by Luciano Didier. Subsequent interviews by Moulton Howe (with translation by Didier and Felipe Branco) explored the many intriguing details of Urandir’s plasma beam transport and transdimensional experiences aboard a plasma ship for three whole days, from February 15-18, 2002:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 131 He (Urandir) was very anxious because for three days already he was expecting to be abducted, and there were only three hours left to the time the beings told him he would be abducted. (...10:00pm). He tried to prepare himself, so he went home and took a shower and put his shorts on and laid down on the bed. He picked up a book and tried to relax. A few minutes later, he realized a flash in the room. Then he felt his body like a fever warming up. Q: What was the color of that flash? The flash was sort of a light purple, or violet... [lit up] the whole room and then was condensing in the form of... a tube that included the bed and himself all the way from the bottom of the floor to the ceiling... The book was in his right hand (extended in the air beyond the right edge of the bed) and when the light flashed, eventually he released the book. The book fell from his hand. And he felt sort of a paralyzing [effect]. He could not move. He really felt this fever in his body and his body on the bed. He felt his body warmer on the bed.

Yes, because it leaves the impression that something burned someone there. But knowing in advance already the beam process of abduction (from earlier encounters), he knew it was not going to be painful at all. Q: What is happening after the heat and going upward? He felt himself rising up and going through the ceiling. From the point he was paralyzed, he could not move so much, but from what he could see, he realized everything was like normal from inside the light as he is rising. Actually the position did not allow him to see much, but what he could see are the normal things like the walls, the door, [and] the window. Q: What happens as he gets up to the wood ceiling? He saw himself going through the ceiling and he could actually see the molecules between the ceiling, like if he were going through foam. Not like a foam rubber, but like a soap, more like soap bubbles, like when you wash your hands and you produce the foam that comes out in the soap. And then he is turned upright so he is standing after he crosses that point of the ceiling, going through the ceiling, in the same violet light. Q: The other day, he mentioned he could see and hear more? Even at the height and distance he was, he could see and hear perfectly well, even better than normal, as if everything was amplified. He could see the stones falling everywhere, he could hear peoples' conversations and see them below... he could only see [the plasma craft] at the moment he approached it. Q: The rocks are falling why? It was a signal, a sign, that the beings left so that everyone would recognize that moment and everyone would know he was being abducted... As he was approaching the craft rising and saw everything that was going on down below, he goes into the first room into the craft. And it is also violet color inside this craft. 7 "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 134 The many fascinating aspects of the plasma beam transport of Urandir Oliveira on September 15, 2002 provide a wealth of information for the study of fourth-density technology. While such vivid descriptions of violet fog and levitation in luminous beams have been shared by many contactees over the last decades, none of those accounts were accompanied by accurate scientific descriptions of the entire experience. Urandir’s case is a gift to Earthly science, in that he provides detailed scientific explanations for physical trace evidence in the form of textile samples with plasma-induced molecular alterations that can be studied by physicists for potential replication by all known means. Previously obtained evidence of transdimensional plasma phenomena subjected to rigorous scientific analyses has been limited to downed plants from crop circle formations. The rapid heating of water contained within the effected plants by microwaves causes expulsion cavities in the nodes of the stalks as water is forced out by high-pressure. Video of plasma balls forming these marvelous geometric mandalas in the crops confirms their formation by the microwave emissions of airborne HHO plasma spheres that are themselves natural elemental beings giving mathematical lessons to Earthly humanity. Scientists have confirmed through various means that the microwave radiation responsible for the many geometric crop formations of non-human origin must have been delivered in a very brief period of time, perhaps involving an exposure of under 7 seconds. This is exactly the conclusion that must be drawn from analyses of the scorched bed sheet evidence presented in the Oliveira contact case (above). Urandir experienced no pain during the plasma beam transport, as the beam technologies employed are completely safe and biocompatible, normally leaving no detectable trace of its use whatsoever. Recently applied as a dental torch, helium/oxygen plasma is safely maintained near room temperatures by use of nanosecond electrical pulses, causing only a few degrees of heating in tooth enamel and gum tissues while vaporizing plaque and sterilizing oral films of bacteria in seconds. 8 During Urandir’s beam transport, the air the room was infused from above with HHO gas bearing gold and silver nanoparticles and rapidly ionized by infrared light followed by nanosecond electrical pulses to form HHO plasma near room temperature, which became concentrated within the beam’s vertical column. The paralysis"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 135 experienced by Urandir is electronically controlled by automated computers in the plasma ship above, as pulses from rotating green lasers within the plasma column created differential forces within the superfluid beam to levitate his body off the bed. The scorching of the bed sheet and pillowcase was then purposefully executed by a very brief heating of the plasma field closely surrounding Urandir’s body just above the bed, before continuing with the strangely silent levitation process. All matter within the fourth-density HHO plasma beam undergoes an atomic synchronization and expansion and that allows complete interpenetration of objects without interference, whereby Urandir’s body was brought directly through the ceiling toward the craft. He describes being rotated into a vertical position after having passed through the roof, allowing him to see all of the activity going on below. Urandir’s description of enhanced vision and hearing inside the plasma beam column is a result of the fourth-density awareness endowed by immersion of the human body in a superconductive state where the holographic aspect of consciousness becomes reunified with the eternity . The bright white light that Urandir describes as emanating from the electroluminescent metal hulls of the plasma ships also radiates from the craft’s interior walls, which electrify the interior chambers with the same biocompatibly tuned HHO plasma that is concentrated within the beam transport tube emanating both ultraviolet-A and infrared light. After Urandir’s transdimensional levitation through the roof of his farmhouse and into the plasma ship hovering silently above, the cloaked ship created a ‘rain of stones’ as a deliberate sign to the neighborhood that the foretold event was indeed taking place. In the video footage recorded by Fabricio da Silva on the night of September 15, 2002, one can hear the round stones occasionally falling on the corrugated steel roofing and rolling down to be collected from the ground by the surprised neighbors. 9 Petrographic microscope analysis of one of the disc-shaped stones collected from the Oliveira farm was conducted by Professor Gomaa Omar, Geologist at the Dept. of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, and the results discussed in an interview with Linda Moulton Howe in June of 2003: It’s very clear when you look at the cross-section here, you can see how [the stones] are banded. This is a mystery to me... I have never seen this particular ‘football-like’ shape and this particular mineral arrangement... Q: And to produce this shape – of these sort of football-shaped or disc-shaped stones... and to have all of this quartz embedded in the iron... [would require a temperature] at about 2,000°F? It was in a melt, yes... Definitely it is very clear that the quartz grains were floating in this iron liquid at high temperatures... But, as to the banding and the stratification going from the center outward, that has something to do with spinning force... and I really don’t know what would cause this spinning force to form this [symmetrically disc-shaped iron/quartz stone]. 10 "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 136 Iron in the red soils of the Corguinho area are attracted to the intense electromagnetic fields generated by the implosive hydrino plasma beam technology. Small grains of quartz sand are lifted from the ground along with the magnetic iron particles to be mixed with the liquified iron suspended in the intense rotating electromagnetic fields generated below the transdimensional spacecraft. Surface oxidation does not occur on the se disc-shaped metallic concretions due to the unique effect of HHO plasma . Inventor Denny Klein noted the rust-resistant properties of surfaces brazed by HHO plasma during experimentation throughout the 1990s, which lead to the first commercial production of HHO gas torches, however short- lived. 11 The convergence of Earthly human technology with extraterrestrial means is greatly accelerating. All over the world, these disc-shaped iron-quartz concretions are created below passing plasma craft of all kinds, even becoming commonplace in dry canyons which act like funnels to collect falling debris (opposite). Rains of these round iron stones have also been recently linked to invisible aircraft above the Indian towns of Ratria 12 Dhenkanal. 13 Infrared video obtained on March 5, 2004 by the Mexican Air Force 14 recorded a quickly moving formation of 11 disc-shaped aircraft that were completely invisible to the naked eye due to their use of HHO plasma screens surrounding each vessel like a bubble, with heat signatures of plasma vortices below each craft being clearly visible (above). The formation of the iron concretions was even filmed during a crash event in New Mexico, 15 actually showing magnetic material in the soil being trapped in the vortex below the craft, visible as molten metal glowing a bright red color. Similar phenomena involving the interaction of iron-rich substrates with the strong rotating magnetic fields of plasmas moving above the terrestrial surface has also been identified on Mars. 16 Contributing to even ts of this kind are various plasma formations including natural lightening arcs that occur before the many impacts of meteor and comet debris to produce tiny spherical iron pellets that become thrown off as slag in a wide shower. The application of this phenomena by Urandir’s fourth-density visitors as a message to the community is another example of their purposeful production of tangible evidence:"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 137 "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 138 Q: [What occurred right after transport into the plasma ship?] This being was waiting, and how many others?

He goes through it, feels very cold, lays down on the bed and then some sort of mist comes in and the shorts he had on disappear and in its place, some kind of other clothes materialized over his skin... [like those worn by the blond beings]. All of them, including his own, emanated a light like silvery-white neon lights... This light stabilizes his chakras and is sterilizing him from any bacteria on this planet. Q: What happened then after he’s in the suit? He walked out of this bubble and went towards them. The greeting with the beings is touching the (index) finger to identify the energy. And the same finger passing, like rubbing, the forehead, like if he was tuning into the other one's mind to start a telepathic conversation... The being touches his own forehead and then Urandir touches his own forehead. Only the (index) fingers touch... only telepathic conversation − no images in his mind. The tall blond male directed Urandir toward stairs and they climbed to the next floor [as seen in his drawing, above] where Urandir was to remain for the next three Earth days watching wall screens of images about the Earth, this solar system and the galaxy. Watching with Urandir were representatives of other non-human species who Urandir understands are allied with the blond beings in a mission to help humans transform and evolve. The tall blond beings are trying to transform the mind frequencies of as many people as possible, raising them in an effort to neutralize large numbers of low frequencies and help block catastrophes they see in Earth's future. Urandir considers himself one of their students and his goal is to share publicly what he has learned about mind energy over matter from the beings. The following excerpts about Urandir's memory of what he was shown and told are taken from a five hour conversation that was tape recorded in Corguinho, Brazil on February 10, 2003, with Portuguese to English translation help. Urandir said that various dates connected with earth changes - both positive and dangerous - were shown to him, but not in chronological order. (After walking up stairs with the blond being to a second floor) the wall of the craft there transforms into a monitor and they start showing scenes... The worldwide events that are going to hap pen ... [in Earth’s immediate future are presented and described telepathically.] Scene 1 - 2014, Outer Space Chunks of Ice The solar system traveling and meeting a curtain of ice pieces approaching... He said the solar system travels in a big galactic cycle through the ice... This is the second time the earth has passed through these huge clumps of ice. It's very close this and it will take maybe 15 years to go through the big pieces, but a few pieces of ice could already be coming toward Earth today. The blond beings said that we cannot see this yet because there is another body that reflects with a very strong electromagnetic field all the light of this ice curtain approaching the solar system... "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 139 Scene 2 - December 22, 2012, Galactic Pulse A giant galaxy was the next image... [with the] solar system down there. On December 22, 2012, this galaxy is going to emanate a big flash of light that will affect all the suns. Every sun reflects to all the planets surrounding them and will cause a 'reversal' not only the earth, but all the planets... It's like God synchronizing the whole universe, like a synchronization ray or beam that would come from God, the Creator. He said it will be seen by any creature on the planet that has eyes to see it... For our planet, there will be lots of solar storms. The suns will get hotter with more solar storms... Scene 3 - December 22, 2012 - Sun and Stars Moving in the Sky They showed how the human beings would see the sky from the earth... Moving, like [on a teeter-totter]... if you are looking at the sky, it will swing. You will see the moon and the stars moving. Q: Like [The Book of] Revelations in the Bible says the stars will move in the sky? Yes, exactly... [moving or wobbling during] both day and night. Scene 4 - 2014 and 2023, 'Plasma Ships' Evacuate Some Humans from Earth In the next scene are lights in the sky which are the blond beings' plasma ships picking up humans from hilltops in their beam transport technology. This is roughly near 2023. But something similar in evacuating human beings starts in 2014. These are like stars representing the plasma ships. People are on the hills and the ships are rescuing them... [The plasma ships emanate] silver light. Like a dish to a dish... Scene 5 - 2004, Cosmic Body Travels Close to Earth At end of 2004, there is a shock due to a body that travels close to our planet and interferes with the climate and atmosphere... [ This event occurred on September 29, 2004 − the close passage of Asteroid Toutatis, as also predicted during the extraterrestrial contacts of Eduard Meier in 1978, who even foretold the exact name that would be chosen by French astronomers several years before the asteroid had been observed.]"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 140 Scene 6 - 2007, Cosmic Body Disturbs Earth's EM Fields; Scientists Discover Life-Extending Water In 2007, there will be both bad news and good news for human beings. There will be a cosmic body [ − Dark Star − ] that moves toward or into the solar system that will affect the earth's electromagnetic fields... This electro- magnetic wave will affect some places locally, different, but not the whole earth. A good example is the Etna volcano in Italy. It could erupt and kill thousands of people. The rest of the world will carry on ... The beings said that science has already got the knowledge, but nothing has been published yet. In the ice caps of the Antarctic, scientists will study the water and find it is more pure, free of heavy water, deuterium? He is saying they are going to find this water with less heaviness. Scientists will discover this new purer water will retard the aging process by about 80 times. People could live 300 or 400 years. The technology to extract this new water in 2007 will be available... [whereby pure protium can be separated from heavier water molecules.] Q: Who is planning this cruel joke of us finding life-extending water just before humans are wiped out by ice blocks only seven years later? But there will be many survivors who can use the new discovery. The Earth has more than 6 billion inhabitants. Around 3 billion will die with all the catastrophes, but nearly as many will survive. Scene 7 - 2028, Blond Beings Return Some Humans to Earth And by 2028, it's like as if they are helping the population trying to help fix the planet. They start bringing back those people they evacuated before. And it starts a new era on the Earth. It's like everyone is part of a cooperative effort... After the evacuation, the people are returned years later but younger than when they were first beamed up into the plasma craft... They are taken into a different dimension that was adapted for the human beings to be preserved... 17 The specific predictive information provided to Urandir Oliveira by his extraterrestrial teachers deserves careful analysis and consideration. Their concise description of the Galactic Pulse of December 22, 2012 being a synchronization beam radiating from the galactic core − observable to all as a bright luminous flash that induces magnetic reversal of the entire Sol system − corroborates descriptions provided by other extraterrestrial sources. The wobbling of the planet for days during a major reorientation in its rotational axis echoes ancient Biblical predictions, and suggests a permanent seasonal change on Earth . We are warned that light from a threatening interstellar ice sheet is reflected by the strong electromagnetic field of the brown dwarf binary twin of our sun, itself having already invisibly entered the solar system. The foretold electromagnetic wave effects of the closing Dark Star are indeed perfectly exemplified by unusual events occurring in the Messina region of Sicily, just west of the mentioned Etna volcano . The town of Canneto di Caronia has experienced repeated evacuations throughout the last several years due to extremely high electromagnetic fields being transduced from intense acoustic energy by the piezoelectric limestone bedrock. The entire area is being bombarded by ultra-low frequency standing waves focused by the Giza pyramids, at a distance of 1,120 miles, or 4.5% of the Earth’s mean circumference. The brief explanation of localized effects given to Oliveira refers to nonlinear focal points of infrasound resonance."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 141 Information given concerning lightwater that Urandir drank with his companions for three days aboard the plasma craft is of great importance, being ‘lighter’ in reference to both its weight and optical aspects . Being comprised of pure protium , with less atomic weight than the heavier forms of water (deuterium and tritium), lightwater can be extracted from mixed terrestrial sources by virtu e of the specific freezing, boiling and vapor points of protium that differ from the lower forms. Oliveira was given astounding details concerning cellular longevity: that under bioelectrification conditions, the ingestion of pure protium lightwater endows an extended lifespan of 300 to 400 years. This is the biological effect of the fourth- density HHO plasma environment that ‘has been adapted for the human beings to be preserved’ such that they are ‘younger than they were when they were first beamed up into the plasma craft.’ It appears that Urandir’s fourth-density teachers recognize the fact of governmental concealment of the anti-aging properties of pure protium water as a valid reason for providing this important information to humanity through Oliveira’s efforts. The invisible bionanotechnological aspects of the lightwater that Urandir drank and absorbed through his skin during his extraterrestrial experiences were not discussed, yet comprise a significant factor in the formation of the HHO plasma that preserves both spacecraft and passengers. Biocompatible gold and silver nanoparticles of less than 10nm in size provide for remarkable optical characteristics, by transducing red and blue light inside all the bodies cells for the activation of DNA as an organic superconductor. This effect cannot occur without the ingestion of these trace metals. Physicists on Earth have now begun to apply the atomic implosion process of hydrogen for the transduction of free energy from the resonant field of infrasound standing waves enveloping the planet, using HHO plasma reactors that contain tungsten power and catalysts that are not biocompatible (above, left). 18 For direct application to the human body, gold and silver nanoparticles and dissolved potassium are essential. Earthly physicists have also recently defined the parameters for containing plasma within a superfluid beam, reporting the appearance of a hexagonal array of vortices during rotation (Ketterle, et al). 19 Oliveira described his experiences inside an HHO plasma transport beam to Linda Moulton Howe: The transport process was reversed, according to Urandir Oliveira, when the tall, blond beings decided to return him on the evening of September 18, 2002, after three days on a second floor room where a large wall screen showed Urandir and many other non-human beings images of Earth's alleged future. During our February 10, 2003, interview about the experience, I asked Urandir if he and the others were in the same room all three days. He answered, \"Yes, it's like the walls were endless. I walked, but never reached the walls, so it gave the impression that the room was really big”... What he says he did understand was that the meeting in the \"endless\" room with many other non-human beings was supposed to have lasted for fifteen Earth days, not only three. But many of the people who had been at the Corguinho farm on the night of September 15, 2002, when the scorched body prints were found on Urandir's bed and the bedroom ceiling told friends, relatives and the Brazilian media about what had happened."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 142 By September 16, 2002, Brazilian television reporters had traveled to Urandir's farmhouse to wait for a craft to return him. Felipe Branco and others who had been shocked the previous night by the bedroom scene had already locked the bedroom and shuttered the windows so no one could enter, including the curious media. When no dramatic aerial or beam activity was seen on September 16 or 17, the media left the farm. Urandir said, \"In the end, the blond being told me that the trip was going to be interrupted, cut short, because of all the movement down there with the media which was not in accordance with what had been committed to me\" by the beings. He understood that the non-humans did not want sensation, but left the physical evidence in the bedroom that unusual energy had interacted there for researchers to analyze. On the evening of September 18, 2002, when the farm was relatively quiet, the tall blond being walked Urandir down the stairs in the craft to the place he had entered in the violet light. There he went back into the bubble where the silver, glowing, leotard-like suit dematerialized from his body and his own underpants materialized on him again. Interview: The violet light was already there and a lot denser... When the violet transforms into a tube that comes down, the light becomes more subtle ... At this point, he walks into the light. As he is going back down in the beam, about half way down, this light changes him from a standing position and puts him in the previous exact position when he was on the bed before (on September 15, 2002). The very same position and he is paralyzed again to go all the way through the roof and ceiling of his house and back to where he was... Q: Any different feeling then? Like as if his bones are stretching. Like cracking joints... The whole skeleton of all his bones go snap, snap. Q: I wonder if it has to do with molecular expansion and contraction of passing his matter body through the roof and onto the bed?"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 143 Yes, it does have something to do with expanded molecular structure so he can interact with matter again. It's as if they are re-tuning the body ... He can see through the same [violet] light to the room... He saw himself going through the ceiling and then he feels his body touch the bed. But before he actually approached the bed, he could not see that the bed was burned because the way in which he was paralyzed would not allow him to. So the (violet) light goes off and everything comes back to normal and he stands up, switched on the room light, and then he is surprised with his bed because it is so burnt. He thought he had been melted there! ...There was some sort of smoke in the ceiling still coming out. I was puzzled... as I photographed and gathered cloth and wood samples from the sheet and the ceiling ... [because] the scorch marks on the pillow and the heavy scorch mark surrounded by the aura of his head in the wood ceiling [above] were in different places... A logical speculation about this difference is that Urandir's body was moving forward toward the head of the bed as it was lifted upward by the violet beam technology ... I asked him why he thought there were no scorch marks of his hand or feet in the ceiling. He was uncertain, but said he understood from the non-humans that the energy beam that lifted his body was precisely tuned to the molecules of his body against the bed in order to separate them from the bed... [It is an] extraordinary technology. Q: What went through his mind as he looked at the sheet and the ceiling? At the time, he started touching himself thinking, 'Have I melted?' And he wanted to know his weight, so he climbed on a scale and he lost 4 kilos (8.8 pounds) in those three days. Q: Did they feed him anything?"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 144 Some tablets with different flavors... If he wanted a meat flavor, they would give a meat flavor. If he wanted a sweet or apple flavor, he would have an apple flavor. Q: Did they give him liquid? Water that was much lighter than our own... Q: He felt perfectly fine? Relaxed, peaceful, joyful. Q: So he is now standing in the bedroom. The ceiling is smoking. He is looking at his own body to see if he is burned... [and his clothing appears unaffected by the high temperatures. Then what happens?] Then he tries to open the door of the room and it's locked. He opened the window and it is blocked from the outside... with bars. Everyone locked the room after he was gone (on September 15) after the [transport] to make sure no one would walk into the room... [thereby securing the evidence of Urandir’s beam transport.] He has an intercom phone, so he called his parents who live on the farm and they rushed to the room to open it. Q: He was gone for at least three days and humans go to the bathroom on a daily basis. What did they provide? There was some sort of a cabin, almost transparent, a plasma material. And the only need or urge he had was to urinate. He did not feel any other urge. When he arrived at the plasma material, there was no hole, no basin, nothing. So, he thought, 'Well, I will just urinate here'... Q: What happened? So he starts urinating and when it is about 10 centimeters for the urine to touch the ground, it would disappear. Q: He said he is standing before a plasma. Is it like a fog? [The plasma cabin and urinal are formed by the] same material as the bubble. [The urine just disappears] before it touches the floor. Q: Do the [extraterrestrial] blond beings urinate? Yes, not as much as we do, but they do...

Budinger [explained] ... that the blue threads in the affected Oliveira sheet are cotton and the white are polyester. The blue and white threads are woven together throughout the sheet, but there is great variability in the body imprint from what looks like burned and charred cloth right next to cloth with only slightly darker blue discoloration that also outlines the entire body print. This is especially interesting when you consider the facts that cotton decomposes, or scorches, at about 148º Centigrade, or about 300 º Fahrenheit. But polyester threads don't melt until 500ºF. There are melted, gummy threads intricately woven throughout the blue cotton threads -even in places where the cotton is not scorched, or even brown. Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory...: ‘I've never seen anything like this. This takes a very, very high precision kind of - whatever the energy, and there had to be energy here to transform, probably at the molecular level, this because it changed the internal energy of the material. Whatever it was... [this form of energy] was extremely precise. ‘I ran on to one region right at the edge of the brown material and the threads - you could actually see where they were white, normal threads, and then just a fraction of a millimeter away, they had begun to be transformed. They were glassy-looking, but you could still see the individual fibers inside. Then in another half millimeter, they were totally homogeneous into this opalescent material. So, that transition is very precise and you could see the line of demarcation if you had the incident light just at the right angle on the sample, you can see this band of change. So, the energy here is very, very precise. ‘I measured the weight per unit area of a control sample. The weight of the control cloth is 17 milligrams per square centimeter. The blue region is 24% higher in weight than the control cloth. I don't think anything was added. It means the energy has changed the density of the polyethylene and to change density means you have to change the molecular structure. There is some incredible technology [being applied] here... Q: This is a photomicrograph of a sample of the body pattern on the Urandir bed that was not scorched, but almost looks wet... [opposite, center.] But in fact that wet look has been caused by a change in the polyester? It sure has. These I call a transition, or the polyester is converted into what I call vitreous fibers. It looks wet, but this is actually sort of an opalescent liquid-looking, but it's like a plastic, very hard. Q: We know that polyester... has a melting temperature of 500°F and that cotton has a scorch temperature of 300°F. The difference of 200°F in this photograph alone is baffling because it looks as if the polyester threads have been melted and the blue cotton threads seem completely untouched. That's right. And that difference of 200°F -that's the astounding thing. The cotton threads are totally undisturbed."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 146 Levengood’s biophysical analyses of microwave-radiated plants from crop formations form the only precedent for the study of material evidence of aerial plasma beam phenomena. Further analyses of the Corguinho bed sheet were undertaken by Professor Herbet J. Barndt, Director of the Grundy Testing Laboratory of the School of Textiles and Materials Technology at Philadelphia University. In an interview by Linda Moulton Howe in May of 2003, Professor Barndt stated that the delicate burn pattern on Urandir Oliveira’s bed sheet must have been made with laser-like precision in mere seconds of exposure: Q: Could you explain a little bit about the possible importance that water might have played – both from having taken a shower and perspiration when this individual laid down? Well, when cotton gets wet, moisture actually goes into the fiber. In other words it’s inside the fiber, as well as on the surface. [In the case of] polyester, the water remains on the surface. So in the presence of a high temperature the water will evaporate from the surface of the polyester before it evaporates from the cotton, because the water is bound to the cotton fiber. So, in order to damage the cotton fiber you have to evaporate the water to get the fiber hot enough to burn. But since the polyester isn’t really holding water it can absorb heat more rapidly, and that may explain why the polyester melted, and the cotton in a number of these areas wasn’t particularly damaged... Q: Does that suggest... whatever did happen to this bed sheet happened in a very quick period of time? I would think so... especially with the temperatures that are involved and the fact that the cotton wasn’t degraded more than it was. it would seem that it had to have been a very quick occurrence, whatever happened here. Q: And we’re talking in seconds, right? I would think so... It’s very unusual... You would have to have a pinpoint heat source like a laser to do that... If you have a heat source that’s intense enough to melt the polyester, and still not cause intense damage to the cotton, or at least some of the cotton, it has to move fairly quickly along this pattern... [or] the whole thing [is briefly heated] all at once... 21 These detailed conclusions of the analyses of the bed sheet evidence from the Oliveira case point directly to a specific plasma heat source that was unknown to the ‘experts’, yet is derived from the most common and basic element in the Universe – hydrogen! It is now known that HHO plasma is unique in that it heats different materials to different temperatures depending on the molecular structure. An HHO plasma torch will not boil water, but instead reverts to water vapor on contact. The implosion of atomic hydrogen allows for precisely tuned interaction with the cotton and polyester threads in discreet bands of temperature change, producing the ultraviolet and infrared emissions described by Urandir as heat and violet light. "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" 147 HHO plasma is also responsible for the molecular changes documented by Levengood regarding the weight increase of the vitreous polyester fibers. Similar analytic results were obtained from other material evidence collected by Oliveira and his group after a brilliant nighttime aerial explosion over Mount Ashtar (above) that scattered radioactive debris later measured with Geiger counters. A small brown ball of a solid resin-coated material was found lodged in a vertical rock face and carefully collected for laboratory analysis (opposite). X-ray diffraction analyses of the roughly spherical, resin-coated metal sample were conducted in the capitol city of Brasil ia to determine the elemental composition of the artifact, which may reveal its extraterrestrial origin. Testing showed abnormally high quantities of rare Earth elements : Analysis of the nucleus, done by Centro Técnico Aerospacial [detected]... iron, oxygen, silicon, titanium and vanadium. In relation to the occurrence of these elements, the iron and the silicon can be largely found as iron ore and as silica... The oxygen is found associated chemically to the iron ore and the silica as iron oxide and silicon oxide, respectively. These oxides are mentioned in the probable presented compounds according to analysis done by x-ray diffraction. The titanium, as well as the iron and the silicon are not found in a pure state in the nature, being found also as oxides. In the sample, the probable compound that contains titanium is the iron oxide and titanium, which can be found in the nature as a mineral called ilmenite. Nonetheless, the most important aspect is the presence of vanadium. This element and all its derivatives are toxic to humans. Pure vanadium is normally used in special steels. It is found in complex minerals, such as vanadite (Pb 5 Cl(VO 4 )3) and carnotite (K 2 (UO 2 ) 2 (VO 4 ) 2 · 3H 2 O), with an occurrence in the crust of the Earth of 0.03% - a very restricted presence in the nature. Vanadium does not occur together with iron, silicon or titanium, which suggests that it was manipulated to be used with these chemical elements. Curiously, some forms of iron ore and titanium can present magnetism, which leads to certain suspicions about a possible mechanism of magnetic control of the space probe. The usage of iron bindings and silicon are also indicated in this sense, together with the bindings with Manganese... [Brasilia’s] Laboratório Instrumental da Divisão de Química do Instituto de Aeronáutica e Espaço do Centro Aeroespacial showed that [the resin] presents a fossilized-material aspect of the ester resin kind, known as amber and silica. 22 "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 148 The initial radioactivity of the recovered probe debris is evidence of molecular changes having occurred during the explosion, while the exotic composition of nucleus confirms its unearthly origin. The amber/silica resin coating presents an organic appearance, yet the roughly spherical metallic core of iron, oxygen, silicon, titanium and vanadium is certainly of non-mineral origin. Brazilian Aerospace laboratories clearly acknowledged the highly unusual magnetic properties of the combination of elements found in the nucleus, while the resonant piezoelectric properties of silicon also implicate a highly advanced magneto-acoustic levitation technology. Silence accompanied the great heat and light emitted during the brilliant flash that briefly lit up the entire area like daylight, as the fusion of the aerial object into a tiny molten mass occurred. The pointed speculation of analytical scientists supports the direct observations of witnesses to the luminous event and is further corroborated by information related in the contact case of Eduard Meier. Exactly this type of brown resin- coated mass was discussed as the byproduct of special security features commonly used by space-travelers visiting Earth. The dangerous potential misuse of technological knowledge is prevented by the installation of self-destruct mechanisms within all instruments and probes, for intentional or automatic activation in the event of malfunction. Semjase informed Meier of the necessity of the elimination of technological materials foreign to Earth, and a complete demonstration of the elimination process during his 62 nd contact with cosmic visitors from the Plejares system, on August 12, 1976: Meier: I have heard that some objects had simply disappeared or burnt, or dissolved themselves in some way, if they were found by Earth human beings and if the objects belonged to some extraterrestrial intelligences. Semjase: The reason therefore is the elimination of these objects. We and many other intelligences are able to eliminate lost, or fallen into insincere hands, things by different ways, or simply to burn these to ashes. This happens by very far-reaching transmitters, which are started by means built into each instrument, a destroyer mechanism. These destroyer mechanisms are usually built into the objects and instruments, which we take to strange and still lowly-developed worlds, for reasons of security, so there does not come the dangerous for them possibilities of progress into the hands of the concerned still lowly-developed forms of life of any planet. These instruments or objects equipped with such destroyer mechanisms are normally produced from synthetic materials, like for example this small thing here... a selective warning instrument... which announces by a fine signal tone to me, when for example now should anyone come near us, whose brainwave pattern is not noted in this instrument, by which I mean, not registered. Meier: ...Can you perhaps demonstrate for me how you destroy such a thing? Semjase: In purpose of your accomplishments, yes. Look, I simply throw it here onto the ground, and now do come a bit aside. – Like that, yes. Now look at this girdle-instrument; when you push these both flat buttons, then the warning means will start itself and burn and change towards a viscous and brown-black synthetic mass. Pay attention to the means laying there and push the two buttons. (I allow myself to push them.) Meier: Can I have the remainders? Know I want to let them get analyzed. Semjase: Yes, but then you should stop burning this mass, as otherwise nothing will remain for you. Don’t touch it until 1 1 / 2 hours have passed, as until then, certain radiations dissolved by the combustion will have escaped out of the mass. Meier: Well, but don’t you think that our scientists could analyze important facts from out of this mass? Semjase: The chance is very small, because this sort of synthetic material allows no more recognition of the original compounds, [and] will in similar form be used as well on the Earth... 23 "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 149 The explanations of Semjase perfectly describe the aerial probe debris recovered by scientific investigators involved with the Urandir Oliveira contact case, despite the more than three decades that separate the statements of Semjase with the spectacular aerial events occurring above Mount Ashtar in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The comprehensive guidance offered by visitors from other worlds, through the persistent efforts of Urandir Oliveira and other dedicated individuals, prepares Earthly humanity for the current electro- magnetic changes connected with the emergence of the brown dwarf binary companion at the outer reaches of our solar system, as the rain of Oort comet impacts bombards every continent of the Earth, continually threatening humanity for a prolonged period of many years into the future. Greatly increased solar flare activity and resulting geomagnetic superstorms will accompany the process of magnetic reversal of the entire solar system in alignment with the Galactic Pulse of December 22, 2012. The ancient calculations of the calendars of the Maya culture resonate with the future events foretold to Urandir Oliveira, as do their advanced lessons on the effects of lightwater. The Maya also identify the transformative effects of the celestial lightwaters of Tláloc that rise in the mists at dawn, in contrast to the degenerative effects of the heavy waters that run downward to the center of the Earth. Indeed, the process of activating the electro-acoustic vibratory fields of Earthly human beings is not only occurring in the plasma ships of extraterrestrial entities, but also in the Mayan pyramids and sacred sites throughout Central America. Through these cosmic methods of bioenergetic activation the disasters threatening Earth’s future may be mitigated or prevented, as the transdimensional enhancement of consciousness allows the integration of new perceptive capabilities in synchrony with the dramatic environmental upheaval.

Michel’s cosmic journey began on a clear night in June of 1987, in the northeast part of Australia, when he was levitated above his home in a bluish plasma to be met by a giant figure in mid-air. Wearing a close-fitting single-piece suit, the huge figure smiled and explained the many unusual circumstances to Michel, before inviting him aboard the giant spacecraft that floated nearby: About 100 meters from us was an enormous sphere, from which emanated a bluish Aura. I later learned that it measured 70 meters in diameter. The light was not steady, but shimmered, resembling a heat haze when one looks from a distance at sand heated by the summer sun. This enormous sphere ‘shimmered’ about ten meters from the ground. With no windows, no openings, no ladder, it appeared as smooth as the shell of an egg. 1 The giant being introduced itself to Michel as Thao, and explained the main purpose of their long journey from their gigantic homeworld, known as the golden planet of Thiaoouba. It was later identified as one of three such golden planets in our galaxy that represent the highest attainment of physical and spiritua l advancement. Michel was invited aboard the spherical super long-range spacecraft, called an ‘Alatora’, and underwent a necessary set of bacterial decontamination processes with the implicit understanding that he was to join this race of gentle giants on a great journey. Michel was given the opportunity to visit their homeworld of Thiaoouba to speak directly with their High Council of 7 Elders, known as the Thaori."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 153 No photographic or physical evidence of Michel’s cosmic journey was obtained, but his vivid descriptions, first published in 1993, provide a wealth of advanced spiritual information and detailed observations that in themselves provide the ultimate validity of his experiences. As Desmarquet clearly acknowledges, “ this extraordinary story will appear to [be]... a story entirely invented – but I do not have the imagination that such a fabrication would require. This is not science fiction. The reader of good faith will be able to recognize the truth in the message I transmit from my new friends to the people of the planet Earth.” For a period of ten days, Michel became the pupil of Thao, a quite impressive personage of 9’8” (290cm) in height, who radiated a youthful wisdom and joyfulness, representing a unisex race of giant human beings inhabiting the planet of Thiaoouba. Being hermaphrodites, all Thiaooubans possess both male and female reproductive organs. Such giant extraterrestrial hermaphrodites may have been depicted by ancient artists in giant stonework, such as the temples of Angkor from the ancient Sanskrit traditions of present-day Cambodia (above, with inset drawing of Thao based on Michel’s descriptions ). Thao’s intriguing facial features combine the elegance of very feminine eyes with a strong masculine chin: Thao... smiled at me and I clearly remember appreciating, for the first time, the beauty and nobility of her face... I have already mentioned her hair, which was long and silky, golden-blond in color, which fell to her shoulders and framed a face that was perfectly oval in shape. She had a large, slightly protruding forehead... Her blue-mauve eyes and long curled lashes would have been the envy of many women on our planet. Her eyebrows curved upwards, similar to the wings of a seagull... The chin, well shaped but slightly angular, suggested a willful determination that was somewhat masculine, but this did not detract from its charm. A faint shadow of hair above her upper lip could have spoiled this perfect face, were it not blond. 2 "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 154 [Upon entering the giant ship, we] were now ‘gliding’ at ground level along a tunnel-shaped corridor that led to a small room, the walls of which were of a yellow so intense that I had to close my eyes... ‘It is not a light. It is just the present color of the walls... There is no paint. There are only vibrations, Michel. You still believe that you are in your Earthly universe, when you are not. You are now in one of our super long-range spacecraft, capable of traveling at several times the speed of light. We will be leaving soon, if you will lie down on this bunk?’ There, in the centre of the room were two boxes - rather like coffins without lids. I stretched out in one of them and Thao in the other... I wanted to lift myself up a little but couldn’t, being held by an unknown and invisible force. The yellow color progressively disappeared from the walls, to be replaced by a blue that was certainly no less intense... [Thao explained the light intensity as a health precaution − ] ‘We come from a planet [that is] bacteriologically different from Earth, which, for us, is a veritable culture medium. Thus, in order to contact you, I was obliged to take this basic precaution. You, yourself, were a danger to me but you are no longer... When you entered this cabin, the color was too intense for you and I gave you the helmet you are now wearing, which was specially designed for you... ‘During the very short time the cabin was yellow and then blue, eighty percent of the dangerous bacteria in you was destroyed. Then perhaps you felt a coolness in the air, similar to when an air conditioner is working; this was another form of disinfection by... let’s call it radiation, although that is not the correct word – it cannot be translated into any Earth language. In this way, I have been disinfected one hundred percent, but you still have enough bacteria to harm us considerably. I am going to give you these two pills, and in three hours you will be able to consider yourself as ‘pure’ as one of us.’ As she spoke, she took a little box from beside her bunk, removed the pills and held them out to me, along with a test tube containing a liquid that I supposed to be water. I swallowed them both, lifting the base of my helmet to do so ... ‘I have given you a special drug in order to cleanse your body of all bacteria that is dangerous to us. I have also given you another drug that has caused your Astral being to leave your body - this will last three hours, the time it will take to purif y you. In this way, you will be able to visit our spacecraft, without danger of contamination to us and without wasting time.’ 3 Thao’s explanation of the intense electroluminescence of the resonant metal walls of the Alatora spacecraft and the necessary preventive bioelectrification protocols can now be properly understood. Lightwater and a pill most likely containing exotic trace elements including electroluminescent nanoparticles of gold and silver became activated by the strong force-field which impeded his movement while reclining in the resonant chamber, illuminating his cellular waters with red and blue light. The precise environmental controls exercised inside the starship reflect the luminosity of Thao’s high- resonance homeworld of Thaioouba. While in Astral body, Michel took the opportunity to ask his impressive new friend a spiritual question of great importance: “First of all, who is God? Does he exist?” ‘I have been expecting this question and it is important that you ask it. On an ancient stone tablet, which I believe is Naacal , it is written: In the beginning there was nothing - all was darkness and silence.’ ‘The Spirit - the Superior Intelligence decided to create the worlds and he commanded to four superior forces... It’s extremely difficult for the human mind, even when highly developed, to comprehend such a thing. In fact, in a sense, it is impossible. On the other hand, your Astral Spirit assimilates it when it is freed from your physical body. But I’m getting ahead of myself - let’s go back to the very beginning.’ ‘In the beginning there was nothing except darkness and a spirit - THE Spirit. The Spirit was, and is, infinitely powerful - powerful beyond the comprehension of any human mind. The Spirit is so powerful that he was able, by the action of his will alone, to trigger an atomic explosion with chain reactions of unimaginable force. In fact, the Spirit imagined the worlds - he imagined how to create them - from the most enormous to the most minuscule. He imagined the atoms. When he imagined them he created, in his imagination, all that moved and will move: all that lived and will live; all that is motionless, or seems to be - every single thing.’ "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 155 ‘But it existed only in his imagination. All was still in darkness. Once he had an overall view of what he wanted to create, he was able, by his exceptional spiritual force, to create, instantaneously, the four forces of the Universe. With these, he directed the first and the most gigantic atomic explosion of all time - what certain people on Earth call ‘The Big Bang’. The Spirit was at its centre and induced it. Darkness was gone and the Universe was creating itself according to the will of the Spirit. The Spirit was thus, is still, and always will be, at the centre of the Universe for he is the Master and Creator of it...’ ‘Well then,’ I interrupted, ‘it’s the story of God as the Christian religion teaches it - or just about - and I never believed in their nonsense...’ ‘Michel, I speak of no religion such as exists on Earth and especially not the Christian religion. Don’t confuse religions with the Creation and the simplicity of all that ensued. Don’t confuse logic with the illogical distortions of religions. We will have the opportunity to talk again later on this subject, and you are certainly in for some surprises... For the moment, I was trying to explain the Creation to you. During billions of years (for the Creator of course, it is eternally the ‘present’, but it is more at the level of our understanding to count by billions of years), all the worlds, suns and atoms were formed, as you are taught in schools, the planets revolving around their suns, and sometimes with their own satellites etc. At certain times in certain solar systems, some planets cool down - soil is formed, rocks solidify, oceans are formed and landmasses become continents. Finally, these planets become habitable for certain forms of life. All this was in the beginning, in the imagination of The Spirit. We can call his first force the ‘Atomic force’. ‘At this stage, by his second force, he conceived the primary living creatures and many of the primary plants, from which later derived the sub-species. This second force we will call the ‘Ovocosmic Force’, as these creatures and plants were created by simple cosmic rays, which ended up with cosmic eggs."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 156 ‘At the very beginning, The Spirit imagined experiencing feelings through a special creature. He had imagined Man by means of the third force that we will call the ‘Ovoastromic Force’. Thus Man was created. Have you ever considered Michel, what intelligence it took to create a human being or even an animal? Blood that circulates thanks to the heart that beats millions of times independently of the will... lungs that purify the bl ood ... the nervous system... the brain which gives the orders, aided by the five senses... the spinal cord which is ultra- sensitive... Have you ever wondered why, that of the billions of individuals on a planet like yours, there are no two fingerprints the same: and why, what we call the ‘crystalline’ of the blood, is just as unique among individuals as the fingerprint? ...Your experts and technicians on Earth, and on other planets, have tried and still try to create a human body. Have they succeeded? In regards to the robots they have made, not even the most highly perfected will ever be more than a vulgar machine in comparison with the human mechanism."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 157 ‘To go back to the crystalline I mentioned just now, it is best described as a certain vibration particular to the blood of each individual. [Scanning electron microscopy imaging of healthy red blood cells is presented below.] It has nothing to do with the blood group. Various religious sects on Earth believe absolutely in the ‘rightness’ of refusing blood transfusions. Their reasons relate to the teachings and books of their religious teachings and their own interpretations of these, whereas they should look to the real reason, which is the impact the different vibrations have on each other... If it is a large transfusion, it can have an influence on the recipient to a degree and, for a length of time, which varies according to the volume of the transfusion. This influence, of course, is never dangerous... After a time, which never exceeds one month, the vibrations of the recipient’s blood takes over, leaving no trace of the vibrations of the donor’s blood... It shouldn’t be forgotten that these vibrations are much more a feature of the physiological and fluidic body than that of the physical body.’ 4 The straightforward scientific explanations provided to Michel Desmarquet by the cosmic beings of Thiaoouba guide Earthly human thinking toward the unified logic that Nature presents all around. The simple beauty of the lessons of the Creation offered by Thao rise in harmony with the teachings of Spirit transmitted to Earth by various other advanced masters in Nature, radiating their light throughout the great depths of the cosmos. The concise explanation given concerning the formation of the cosmos through the four forces of Creation clarifies the quantum interactions of the short- and long-wave aspects of Creation, also referred to as the matter and anti-matter Universes. The Atomic force propels the material creation ( ultrasonic resonances ), the Ovocosmic force generates and maintains plant and animal life ( infrasonic resonances ) and the Ovoastromic force manifests through human life and consciousness. The fourth force was explained to Michel only later, after further necessary explanations were addressed: The Astral force. Thao’s comparison of the fingerprint with the unique resonant frequency of the ‘crystalline of the blood’ of each individual is just one of the many fascinating pieces of information that lead human consciousness on Earth toward the deeper cognitions that will unfold with this great change of the ages."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 158 Simple descriptions preserved in ancient Vedic texts belie a profound depth of awareness that confirms that visitations like the one described by Michel Desmarquet had also occurred in the Vedic Age of Atlantis, before being recorded on parchment in later times. The only precedents among the historical documents of Earth for such a story as the one told by Desmarquet are to be found among the Sanskrit cultures of the world, including sacred Mayan and Egyptian hieroglyphic texts as well as Sumerian cuneiform writings, that record the teachings of highly spiritual visitors from the stars. The great teachings of ancient prophets are being given anew through the contacts of Earthly human beings in our times, in preparation for the ascension of Earth into collective consciousness. The scribes of Sumer also recorded the malevolent extraterrestrial interests of the Annunaki involving the extraction of gold, using Earthly human slave labor, for the ultimate purpose of enriching the atmosphere of their own planet. 5 This unusual and highly advanced concept of golden atmospheres and golden rivers is also discussed in the ancient Sanskrit writings of India. An intriguing dialog between King Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami preserved in the Srimad Bhagavatam describes the golden waters of heavenly planets. The Description of Jambudvîpa (Canto 5, Ch. 16) identifies certain golden rivers on Earth (in the material world) and their benefits, as enjoyed on other heavenly planets such as Thiaoouba: The mud on both banks of the River Jambu-nadi, being moistened by the flowing juice and then dried by the air and the sunshine, produces huge quantities of gold called Jambu-nada. The denizens of heaven use this gold for various kinds of ornaments. Therefore all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and their youthful wives are fully decorated with golden helmets, bangles and belts, and thus they enjoy life... (Text 21) The residents of the material world who enjoy the products of these flowing rivers have no wrinkles on their bodies and no grey hair. They never feel fatigue, and perspiration does not give their bodies a bad odor. They are not afflicted by old age, disease or untimely death, they do not suffer from chilly cold or scorching heat, nor do their bodies lose their luster. They all live very happily, without anxieties, until death. (Text 25) 6 The se ancient dialogs quite astonishingly detail all of the known antibacterial effects of bioelectrification using nano-colloidal gold and silver water, in addition to other benefits that remain unrecognized by contemporary scientists, such as an increased tolerance to temperature extremes. Such odd, enigmatic information contained in ancient writings concerning atmospheric gold and silver is now comprehensible in the context of the scientific use of nanoparticles for the illumination of DNA within all cells of the human body and the ignition of atmospheric HHO plasma , just as vividly described by Michel on Thiaoouba:"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 159 Suddenly, there it was, right in the middle of the panel... Thiaoouba! My guess had to be correct - I could feel it. Thao immediately telepathized an affirmative, leaving me in no doubt... As we approached and Thiaoouba grew on the panel, I couldn’t take my eyes off the sight, for what I saw before me was indescribably beautiful. Initially, the first word which sprang to mind was ‘luminous’ - this then was juxtaposed with ‘golden’ - but the effect produced by this color was beyond any description. If I were to invent a word, perhaps one that might apply would be ‘lumino- vapour -golden’. In fact, one had the impression of plunging into a luminous and golden bath – almost as if there were very fine gold dust in the atmosphere. We were descending gently on to the planet and the panel no longer showed its contours, but rather, the contours of a continent could be distinguished, ending abruptly at an ocean that was sprinkled with a multitude of islands of different colors... The closer we came, the greater was the detail discernible... What captivated me most, was the color before me – I was dazzled! All the colors were, in each tonal variation more vivid than ours. A bright green, for example, almost shone – it radiated color. A dark green had the opposite effect – it ‘kept’ its color. It is extremely difficult to describe, for the colors on this planet could not be compared with any that exist on Earth. A red could be recognized as red, but it wasn’t the red we know. There is a word in Thao’s language which defines the types of colors on Earth and on planets similar to ours. Our colors are Kalbilaoka which I translate as ‘dull’, theirs, on the other hand, are Theosolakoviniki which means they radiate their colors from within. My attention was soon drawn to what looked, on the screen, like eggs - yes, eggs! I could see the ground dotted with eggs, some half covered with vegetation, and others quite bare. Some seemed bigger than others and some lay down. Others were upright with what looked like the pointed end towards the sky. I was so astonished by this sight that I turned again towards Thao to ask her about these ‘eggs’, when suddenly on the screen, there appeared a round form surrounded by several spheres of different sizes, and, slightly further away, yet more ‘eggs’. These ones were enormous. I recognized the spheres to be space vessels just like ours."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 160 ‘Affirmative’, said Thao from her seat, ‘and the round form you see is the cell in which our spacecraft will be accommodated in a few moments, for we are in the process of docking. ‘And the gigantic eggs, what are they?’ Thao smiled. ‘Buildings, Michel, but just now, there is something more important that I must explain to you. Our planet contains many surprises for you, but there are two, which could have harmful effects on you. I must therefore ensure that you take certain elementary precautions. Thiaoouba does not have the same gravitational force as your planet. Your weight would be 70 kilograms on Earth - here it will be 47 kg. When you leave the spacecraft, if you aren’t careful, you risk losing your sense of equilibrium in your movements and your reflexes. You’ll be inclined to take too great a stride, and perhaps fall and injure yourself...’ ‘But I don’t understand. In your spacecraft, I feel fine.’ ‘We have related the internal gravitational pull to correspond with that of Earth – or almost... It’s true that under this force, our bodies are heavier, but we have counter-balanced this by a semi-levitation, thus we are not uncomfortable, and at the same time, we have the satisfaction of seeing you move among us at ease.’ A slight jolt indicated we had docked. This extraordinary trip was over - I was going to put my foot on another planet. ‘The second point,’ Thao resumed, ‘is that you will be obliged to wear a mask, for a while at least, for the brightness and the colors will literally intoxicate you, just as if you had drunk alcohol. The colors are vibrations that act on certain points on your physiological body. On Earth, these points are so slightly stimulated, so little exercised, that here, consequences could be unfortunate...’ There, she took a helmet, very light, which covered my face from my forehead to just below my nose. ‘Let’s go, Michel, and welcome to Thiaoouba.’ Outside the spacecraft, we walked along a very short walkway. Immediately, I felt lighter. The sensation was very pleasant, although somewhat disconcerting, since several times I lost balance and Thao had to steady me. We saw no one, a fact that surprised me... After a short distance, we arrived at a round platform, to the side of the walkway. Thao sat down on a circular seat inside the platform and signaled that I should sit down opposite her... She took out an object the size of a walkie-talkie and immediately I felt myself pinned to the seat, just as I had been in the spaceship, by an invisible force field. Then, quite gently and with a barely perceptible hum, the platform rose by several meters and moved off rapidly towards the ‘eggs’, about 800 meters away. The thin and slightly perfumed air was lashing the exposed area of my face below my nose, which was very nice, its temperature being around 26 degrees Celsius. In just seconds, we arrived, and passed through the walls of one of the ‘eggs’, as if we’d passed through a cloud. The platform stopped and came to rest gently on the floor of the ‘building’. I looked around me in all directions... It seemed absurd, but the ‘egg’ had disappeared. We had indeed, entered the ‘egg’ and yet around us, as far as the eye could see, stretched the countryside. We could see the landing ground and the docked spaceships just as though we were outside... Not far from us, were gathered twenty or thirty people, all busy to some extent, in front of desks and screens which flashed with colored lights - similar to inside the spacecraft. A type of music played very softly, elevating me to a state of euphoria..."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 161 Michel Desmarquet’s thoroughly detailed and fascinating description of the visual splendor of the golden planet of Thiaoouba contains a wealth of information for scientific consideration, as well as a direct reference to the abundance of atmospheric gold (nanoparticles) visible throughout the luminous skies of Thiaoouba! This vaporous luminosity of Thiaoouba’s atmosphere is created by light amplification effects of the HHO plasma that forms around the gold nanoparticles, which electroluminesce under the influence of atmospheric electrical currents moving through the resonant field of infrasound standing waves. Thao’s description of the effect of high-intensity colored light on the human body is also quite intriguing. Informing Michel that “the colors are vibrations that act on certain points on your physiological body”, Thao offers an only slightly veiled reference to the pineal gland to the center of the human brain – also known as the ‘third-eye’ or ajna chakra among ancient Sanskrit traditions. The pineal gland is truly an eye , being photosensitive, and is responsible for the alignment of the body’s circadian rhythms with the sun by light reception in the center of the brain. 7 Thao later explained in great detail the role of the pineal gland as one of the six principle points within the chakra system of the human body: ‘The fluidic body [includes the brain stem and spinal cord, and ] influences the physiological body which, in turn, influences the physical body... In the fluidic body, you possess six principal points which we call Karolas and which the yogis on your planet call Chakras. The first Chakra is the one situated between your two eyes, just a centimeter and a half above your nose. It’s the ‘brain’ of your fluidic body, if you like; it corresponds to the pineal gland [in red, at left], which is placed much further back in your physical brain but on exactly the same level... ‘Now, at the bottom of the fluidic body and just above the sex organs, is found a very important Chakra, which we call the Mouladhara, and which your yogis call Sacred [or Sacral]. Above this Chakra, and meeting the spinal column, is the Palantius. It is in the form of a coiled spring and only reaches the base of the spinal column when it is relaxed. ‘For it to become relaxed, it requires the accomplishment of the sexual act between two partners who must not only love one another, but also have a spiritual affinity between them. Only at that moment and under these conditions will the Palantius extend to the spinal column, transferring an energy and special gifts to the physiological body which then affects the physical body. The person concerned will experience happiness in sexual enjoyment that is far greater than normal. ’ 8 Thao identifies the shape and function of the palantius in much the same way as the coiled Kundalini serpent of Sanskrit teachings, and further reveals the special conditions for such an activation include not only partnership in love, but also true spiritual affinity . As proven by research scientists, such spiritual affinity takes the form of a heart/mind resonance between the two , 9 whereby releasing the palantius. The identification of the chakras as existing within the fluidic body is also very concise, meaning within the spinal fluid itself. While the definition of the pineal gland as the first chakra presents an inverse order when compared with Sanskrit traditions, the Thiaoouban name of the root chakra –the Mouladhara– is identical to Sanskrit terminology. The attunements of Michel’s chakras were so powerfully influenced by the luminosity of the high-resonance atmosphere of Thiaoouba that, combined with the intensity of ambient infrasound and the resulting decreased weight, his state of consciousness was elevated to euphoric levels that are only momentarily experienced by human beings on Earth, if ever. The highly elevated levels of all frequencies of electromagnetic radiation also required longer periods of rest. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 162 The profound attainment of knowledge witnessed on Thiaoouba is reflected in the delicacy of colors and radiating brilliance of every life-form preserved there in harmony with the advanced technological lifestyle of the giant human inhabitants. Ever-present forms and forces within nature inspire the technological creations observable on this planet, whose buildings take on the form of eggs, and plasma spacecraft display a spherical perfection. The flying circular platform used for Michel’s magnificent tour of Thiaoouba (illustrated above) is resonantly designed to generate the barely perceptible humming sound that Michel described during lift-off. Invisible magnetic fields are generated as belts that act as safety harnesses, and a domed magnetic field forms a protective covering enclosing the occupants of the open platform aircraft. The grand scale of the trees and flowers, as well as the insects and animals, is a reflection of the enhanced gravity conditions of Thiaoouba, which are similarly witnessed in the geological record of Earth. During the age of dinosaurs, all life-forms on earth were correspondingly larger than witnessed today. Insects were once several times larger than the same types now living and would be crushed by the present conditions of gravity were they to be found on the planet today. The relative conditions of planetary gravity are directly tied to the intensity of atmospheric infrasound standing wave resonance. We rejoined our vehicle and immediately accelerated away in the direction of a forest, which could be seen in the distance. We flew at a height of approximately five or six meters and at a speed I would have estimated to be 70 or 80 kilometers per hour. The air was warm and fragrant and I again felt euphoric, in a way I had never experienced on Earth. We arrived at the edge of the forest and I remember having been greatly impressed by the size of the largest trees. They looked to rise about 200 meters into the sky. ‘The tallest is 240 of your mete rs, Michel.’ Thao explained without me having to ask, ‘and between 20 and 30 meters in diameter at the base. Some of these are 8000 of our years old. Our year consists of 333 days of 26 karses. A karse is a period of 55 lorse, a lorse comprising 70 kasios, and a kasio being almost equivalent to one of your seconds... "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 163 The vehicle greatly reduced its speed and we were able to glide between, or indeed, stop and observe more closely, the trees at heights that ranged from almost ground level to 10 meters above th e ground. Thao was able to guide our ‘flying platform’ with amazing precision and expertise. Our vehicle, and Thao’s manner of driving it, put me in mind of a flying carpet, which was taking me on a magical tour of this magnificent forest... Thao leaned towards me and removed my mask. The undergrowth was luminous and softly golden but I found it quite tolerable... ‘It is a good time to begin accustoming yourself to the light and color, Michel. Look!’ Following her gaze, I spotted, very high among the branches, three butterflies, vividly colored and of enormous size. These lepidoptera, which must have had one meter wingspans, fluttered high in the foliage, but we were lucky to see them fly closer and closer to us, on wings of blue, green and orange. It is as clear to me as if it were yesterday. They brushed against us with their wings that were strangely fringed, to create the most beautiful and breathtaking effect. One of them came to rest on a leaf just a few meters from us and I was able to admire its body, ringed with silver and gold, and its jade-green antennae. Its proboscis was golden and the tops of its wings were green with streaks of bright blue alternated with dark orange diamond shapes. The under-sides were dark blue, but luminous, as though they had been illuminated from above by a projector. For the duration of time this giant insect remained on the leaf, it seemed to emit a soft whistling sound and I was quite surprised by this. I had certainly not heard a lepidopteran on Earth make any sound at all. Of course, we were no longer on Earth but on Thiaoouba, and this was only the beginning of a long series of surprises for me. On the forest floor, grew an incredible variety of plants, each one stranger than the next. They covered the ground completely, but I noticed very few bushes among them... the forest's giants prevented them from developing. In size, these plants varied from a ground-covering moss-like plant, to one the size of a large rose bush. One kind, with leaves as thick as a hand in various shapes - sometimes heart-shaped or circular, sometimes very long and thin - was of a color tending much more towards blue than to green. Flowers of every shape and color, even of the purest black, entwined each other. From our altitude of several meters, the effect was absolutely glorious. We rose till we were up among the highest branches and I put my mask back on according to Thao’s direction. We emerged from the canopy and moved slowly, just above the foliage of those enormous trees."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 164 Above the forest the light was, once again, incredibly intense and I had the impression of traveling through a landscape of pure crystal. Marvelous birds were perched on the tops of the taller trees, watching us pass, without fear. Their colors, varied and rich, were a veritable feast for my eyes in spite of the subduing effect of my mask. Here were varieties of macaw, with blue, yellow, pink and red plumage; and, among them a type of bird of paradise strutted amidst a cloud of what appeared to be hummingbirds. These hummingbirds were of a brilliant red color flecked with gold. The red, pink and orange tail feathers of the birds of paradise, would have measured 250 centimeters in length and their wingspans almost two meters . When these ‘jewels’ took flight, the underside of their wings revealed a very soft, misty pink, with just a touch of bright blue on the tips - so unexpected, especially as the tops of their wings were of an orange-yellow color . Their heads wore plumes of impressive size, each feather being a different color: yellow, green, orange, black, blue, red, white, cream... I feel frustrated that my attempts to describe the colors I saw on Thiaoouba are so inadequate - I feel I need a whole new lexicon, as my language fails me. I had the constant impression that the colors came from within the objects I looked at, and the color was more than I had known it to be. On earth, we know perhaps 15 shades of red; here there must have been over a hundred... It wasn’t only the colors that claimed my attention. The sounds that I had heard since we began to fly over the forest inspired me to seek an explanation from Thao. It was almost a background music, very light and soft, similar to a flute which continually played the same air but at a distance. As we moved on, the music seemed to change, only to return to the original tune. ‘Is that music I hear?’ ‘It is vibrations emitted by the thousands of insects which, when combined with the vibrations of the colors reflected by solar rays on to certain plants, such as the Xinoxi, for example, produce the very musical results that you hear. We, ourselves, only hear it if we particularly attune to it, for it comprises an integral part of our life and our environment. It is restful, isn’t it? ... According to the experts, if these vibrations were to cease, we would experience considerable eye trouble. This will perhaps seem odd at first, since these vibrations appear to be perceptible to the ear rather than the eye. However, ...the chance of their ceasing is as remote as the chance of our sun extinguishing itself tomorrow.’"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 165 Thao turned our vehicle and in a few moments, we had left the forest tops and... I saw we were approaching the ocean. Palm trees resembling coconut palms waved their majestic fronds at impressive heights, on th e edge of a beach of golden sands... A hundred or so people basked on the sand or swam, entirely naked, in the transparent waters of the ocean. I felt a little dazed, not only because of the new and wondrous things I was constantly discovering, but also because of the perpetual sensation of lightness, due to the change in gravity. This sensation was my reminder of Earth – what a strange word, and how difficult it was to visualize Earth now! The auditory and visual vibrations were also affecting my nervous system enormously. Usually a highly-strung person, I was feeling completely relaxed... –so relaxed I felt like crying. 10 The perfection of natural beauty and harmony of life on Thiaoouba resonated deeply with Michel, its intense radiations bathing him in a field of love that has been raised to the highest resonance: The sun was already quite low and the sky was totally clear. The ocean had taken on an orange color, which was surprising. I never would have imagined water could appear such a shade. Inquiring about it, telepathically, it was explained to me that, sometimes, at this time of day, immense patches of orange colored plankton would rise to the surface. These waters, it appeared, contained enormous quantities of plankton. What a sight it was: the sky was blue-green, the sea was orange, and everything was enveloped in the golden light which, on this planet, seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere. 11 The intense luminous qualities described by Michel can only be explained as an amplification effect of diffuse atmospheric HHO plasma generated by electroluminescent nanoparticles of silver and gold suspended in the planet’s strong enveloping field of infrasound standing waves. The tranquil weather patterns well described throughout Michel’s nine-day adventure on Thiaoouba are a reflection of the planet’s highly balanced atmospheric systems. Desmarquet was also taken by the intense nighttime optical effects of Thiaoouba’s many-layered canopy of atmospheric HHO plasma, which amplifies all starlight as seen from the ground, creating a magnificent opportunity for direct stellar observation: "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 166 No one spoke; we sat in silence. Looking up, I could see the stars appearing one by one, shining colorfully as though a firework display had ‘frozen’ in the sky. On Thiaoouba, because their layers of gasses in the atmos- phere differ from ours, the stars appear to be colored and also much larger than they appear to us on Earth. 12 The color of each particular star is amplified as it passes through many atmospheric layers of HH O plasma, formed from water vapor that becomes ionized as a glowing plasma canopy. HHO plasma forms a barely visible network of thin veils suspended along the pathways of infrasound standing waves where gold and silver nanoparticles are kinetically energized, allowing the splitting of water molecules into single atoms of hydrogen and oxygen (HHO gas). The ancient Sanskrit knowledge of ‘heavenly planets’ is in complete correspondence to the experiences so richly described by Michel Desmarquet on the golden planet of Thiaoouba! The natural domed plasma canopies of heavenly planets form the divine inspiration for the unified egg-shaped design of all habitations, temples and spaceports, reflecting the Ovocosmos : The vehicle proceeded slowly at ground level and, after a final bend in the path, we arrived before a ‘little egg’, nestled among small trees and flowering vines. It seemed that every building on this planet had the shape of an egg, most often lying on their ‘sides’ but occasionally upright, as I have said, with the pointed end upwards. The ‘shells’ were off-white in color and had no windows or doors. This particular egg lay on its side, apparently half buried in the ground. It was about 30 meters long and 20 meters in diameter - quite small in comparison with those I’d seen so far. Thao stopped the vehicle in front of a bright light centered on the wall of the egg. Leaving the platform, we entered the habitation. As we did so, I felt a light pressure, with no more force than the weight of an eiderdown. I remembered experiencing the same sensation earlier, when we passed through the wall of the space centre... Having neither doors nor windows on these buildings is extraordinary in itself, but once inside, it was stranger still. As I have mentioned before, the overall impression was of still being outside."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 167 The startling beauty of color was everywhere; the greenery; the branches of the trees dissecting the blue- mauve sky above; the butterflies; the flowers...I recall a bird that came to rest right in the middle of the roof, so that we could see the bottom of its feet. It was as though it had miraculously stopped in mid-air – the effect was quite extraordinary... The only contrast with the outside was provided by the floor that was covered in a type of carpet on which was arranged comfortable looking seats and large pedestal tables. All of these furnishings were, of course, on a large scale - appropriate to these ‘large-scale’ people. ‘Thao,’ I asked, ‘how are your walls transparent and yet we can’t see in from the outside? And how can we pass through your walls as we did?’... ‘You see, Michel, this habitation exists because of a magnetic field that is quite special. We have copied the forces of nature and the creations of nature to our own ends. Let me explain. Every body - human, animal or mineral - possesses a field around itself. The human body, for example, is surrounded both by an Aura and by an etheric force (field) of oval shape [at left]. You know that, don’t you?’ I nodded. ‘The latter comprises, in part, electricity and, to a greater extent, vibrations that we call Ariacostinaki... These vibrations occur continuously for your protection while you are alive, and they are not to be confused with the vibrations of the Aura. With our habitations, we have copied nature in creating a field of mineral electro-etheric vibrations around a nucleus.’ Thao indicated an ‘egg’, the size of an ostrich egg, located in the middle of the room between two seats... [as the nucleus.] ‘This way,’ she said, smiling again and taking several steps in another direction. ‘Do you see this transparent drawer? Inside you have various compartments. From left to right: fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, dairy products, vegetables and fruits, and here in the last, we have what you call ‘manna’, which is our bread...’ ‘You tell me that, on Earth, this bread is known as ‘manna’. How is it that it exists on Earth at all?’ ‘It is a product we always carry on our intergalactic spacecraft... very practical... easily compressed and highly nourishing. In fact, it’s a complete food. It comes from wheat and oats and you could live on it alone for months.’ 13 Michel’s unusual descriptions of the giant egg-like domed magnetic fields of the buildings of the people of Thiaoouba reflect a simplicity and natural beauty that is profoundly inspiring. Thao’s concise explanation of the etheric force field surrounding the ostrich-egg sized nucleus of the building was very carefully given in terms understandable to Michel, yet can be further understood in scientific terms. Each domed building is located at precise focal points of resonant infrasound standing waves, which become transduced by the resonant metal alloys of the nucleus into a vast electromagnetic field dome of the same shape. The sacred oval or egg shape is repeated throughout Nature as reflections of the structure of the Universe, the great ovum . The Ovocosmic force can be described structurally by the Mandelbrot Set quadratic function [ z n+1 = z n 2 + c ] (above) , and the closely related function for nonlinear standing waves: [ z n+1 = z n 2 ]. The entire design of the Thiaoouban spiritual center of the City of Nine Dokos, home to the Seven Masters of the Thaori, conforms to this sacred cosmic force of resonant infrasound (opposite). Thiaoouban manna bread was described as consisting of oats and wheat, while the electrical properties of invisible constituents including nanosilver and gold are indispensible for space travel, enabling the transdimensional effect of superconductivity of the human body for hyperleaps across the Universe. Gold and silver together comprise the ancient alloy electrum , so named for high electrical conductivity. Vedic scholars recently identified the Sanskrit term for electrum as ‘Soma’ , described as granting eternal life through the luminosity of the electrum nanoparticles consumed in both foods and drinks: "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 168 “We have drunk the Soma and become immortal. We have attained the light the gods discovered.” (Rig Veda: VIII.48.3)... “Soma is food for the gods. Gods eat Soma.” (Chàndogya Upanishad : V.10.4)... “The man who supplies food hath always [his Soma] pressing stones adjusted, a wet Soma filter, well-prepared religious rites... he who hath this knowledge wins the luminous spheres.” (Atharva Veda: IX.6)... Soma , Soma ma ̄ al, asemon, asem, electrum may perhaps denote the same substance... (which required the purificatory 'mineral waters') contained in the kaman.d.alu symbols in the icons of the yaks.a legacy. It may perhaps be the same substance said to be am°tam which was considered to be the elixir of life, of immortality. It may perhaps be the same substance referred to, in sheer poetry, as amritam àyur hira ̄ yam . Gold is immortality. 14 Vedic hymns clearly identify the intracellular luminosity of electrum-enriched Soma waters and foods as endowing eternal life . Vedic wisdom also relates the yogic practice of levitation using the bodily force of ‘laghima’ – an ability that Thao suddenly demonstrated for Michel while selecting Soma food preparations : ‘We can, as readily, lift ourselves in the air, but that serves no great purpose other than our own amusement.’ Having said that, Thao, who was sitting cross-legged, began to rise above her seat and floated about the room, finally coming to rest in mid-air. I stared at her, but soon realized I was the only one fascinated by her accomplishment. Indeed, I must have looked idiotic, for all eyes were fixed on me. Evidently, Thao’s behavio r was perfectly normal to my friends but they were more interested in the astonished expression on my face... Thao descended slowly on to her seat. ‘That demonstrates one of the many sciences you have lost on Earth, Michel - apart from a few individuals who are still capable of doing it... There was a time when it was practic ed by many, along with many other skills.’ 15 "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 169 The demonstration of levitation given by Thao was one of many special lessons given to Michel on the golden planet. On Earth, this bioenergetic art form was practiced as one of the attainments, or siddhis known to Sanskrit adepts, in addition to being able to make one’s body become larger or smaller, invisible or radiant, or instantaneously translocate or bilocate (being in two places at once). Thao would make demonstrations of other siddhis later during her discussions with Michel, and proceeded with a lesson on auras and color coordination for the balancing of physical health and consciousness: ‘The colors of your robe were chosen according to those of your Aura; that’s why you feel so good. If people on Earth were able to see Auras, they too could choose colors, which suit them and thereby enhance their feeling of well-being. They’d make use of color rather than aspirin...’ ‘I’ll give you an example. Do you ever remember saying of someone: ‘oh, those clothes don’t suit you at all. He, or she, has no taste'? ...If you were to suggest it be because of the colors they were wearing, they would think you odd. You could explain that the vibrations of the colors were in discord with those of their Auras, but they would be no more inclined to believe you. On your planet, people only believe in what they see or touch... and yet the Aura can be seen... The Aura vibrates constantly with colors that vary. At the top of your head is a veritable bouquet of colors, where almost all the colors you know are represented. ‘Around the head too, is a golden halo, but it is only really obvious in the most highly spiritual people and in those who have sacrificed themselves in order to help someone else. The halo resembles a golden mist, much like painters on Earth depict the haloes of ‘saints’ and of Christ. The haloes were included in their paintings because, in those times, some of the artists actually saw them... The colors are all there in the Aura: some shine more strongly, others are dull. People in poor health, for example, or people with bad intentions... Many people on Earth could see it and read it a very long time ago, but there are few now. Calm yourself, Michel. You will see it, and not only one but several, including your own.’... Approaching the coast, I could recognize enormous dokos, their points as usual towards the sky, I counted a group of nine, but the island was sprinkled with others, smaller and less visible amongst the vegetation. Thao took us higher and we were soon flying over what Thao called Kotra quo doj Doko - ‘The City of the Nine Dokos’. Skillfully, Thao brought us down between the dokos, to a beautiful park located in their midst. In spite of my mask, I was aware that the golden mist that enveloped Thiaoouba was much denser around these dokos than elsewhere. Thao confirmed I was not mistaken in my perception..."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 170 Eventually, we reached the Central Doko and stopped below the entrance light. Thao seemed to concentrate for several seconds, then she took me by the shoulder and we passed through the wall... She immediately removed my mask, advising at the same time, that I half-closed my eyes, which I did. Light filtered through my lower lids and after a time, I was able to open my eyes normally... I must say, that this brightness, more golden than in my own doko, was considerably uncomfortable at first... This doko must have been 100 meters in diameter. We headed directly, although more slowly, for the centre, where seven seats, each occupied, were arranged in a semi-circle. The occupants sat as though petrified and, at first, I thought them to be statues... In looks they resembled Thao, although their hair was longer and their facial expressions more serious, giving them the air of being older. Their eyes seemed to be illuminated from within, which was somewhat disturbing. What struck me most of all, was the golden haze, even stronger here than outside, which seemed to concentrate in haloes around their heads... When one of them raised a hand to indicate Thao and I should each take a seat facing them, I was indeed awestruck, and the word is feeble. I could not have imagined it possible that such radiant beings could exist: it was as though they were on fire inside and emitting rays from within. They sat on block-like seats, fabric-covered, with straight backs. Each seat was of a different color - some only slightly different and others vastly different from their neighbors. Their clothes too, differed in color, suiting each wearer perfectly. All of them sat in what we call on Earth, the ‘lotus position’ that is, the sitting position o f Buddha, with hands resting on knees... It was the central figure who addressed me, in a voice so melodious and, at the same time, so authoritarian. I was stunned by it, particularly since he spoke in perfect French. ‘You are welcome among us, Michel. May The Spirit assist and enlighten you.’ The others echoed: ‘May The Spirit enlighten you.’ He began to rise gently above his seat still in the lotus position, and floated towards me. This did not entirely surprise me since Thao had previously demonstrated this technique of levitation. I wanted to rise before this undoubtedly great and highly spiritual personage, as a measure of the infinite respect inspired in me. In trying to move, I found I couldn’t - as though paralyzed in my seat... He stopped just above and in front of me, placing both his hands on my head; the thumbs joined on my forehead above my nose, opposite the pineal gland, and the fingers joined at the top of my head. It was Thao who described these details to me later, for at the time, I was overwhelmed by such a sensation, that the details didn’t register. During the time his hands were on my head, it seemed that my body no longer existed. A gentle warmth and delicate perfume originated within me, emanating in waves and blending with soft music that was barely audible... Suddenly, I could see amazing colors surrounding the figures opposite me and, as the ‘leader’ returned slowly towards his seat, I could see a multitude of radiant colors around him; ones I had been unable to perceive before. The principal color was a mass of pale pink which enveloped the seven figures, as though in a cloud, and their movements caused that wonderful, glowing pink to encircle us also! "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 171 When I had sufficiently recovered my senses to turn towards Thao, she too, was surrounded with wonderful colors, although less brilliant than those around the seven figures... You will notice that, in speaking of these great personages, I instinctively use ‘he’ rather than ‘she’. In explaining this, I can only suggest that the personalities of these special beings were so strong and their bearings so imposing, that I recognized more of the masculine in them than the feminine –I mean no offence to women– my reaction was instinctive... However, women or men, they had transformed me. I knew that the colors surrounding them were their Auras. I was capable of seeing Auras –who knew for how long– and I wondered at what I saw. The ‘leader’ had resumed his seat and all eyes were fixed on me, as if they wanted to see inside me, which indeed, is what they were doing. Silence reigned for a time, which seemed interminable. I watched the varied colors of their Auras vibrate and dance around them, sometimes far in the distance and recognized the ‘bouquet of color’ Thao had spoken of earlier... The golden haloes, clearly defined, were almost saffron colored. It occurred to me, they could not only see my Aura, but possibly read it as well. I suddenly felt quite naked before this learned assembly. The question that haunted me was: why have they brought me here? Abruptly, the ‘leader’ broke the silence. ‘As Thao has already explained to you, Michel, you have been chosen by us, to visit our planet, in order to report certain messages and to offer enlightenment on several important issues when you return to Earth. The time has come when certain events must occur. After several thousand years of darkness and savagery on the planet Earth, a so-called ‘civilization’ appeared and, inevitably, technology was developed –a development, which was accelerated during the last 150 years."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 172 ‘It has been 14,500 years since a comparable level of technological advance existed on Earth. This technology, which is nothing compared with true knowledge, is nevertheless, sufficiently advanced to become harmful to the human race on Earth in the very near future... harmful, because it is only material knowledge and not spiritual knowledge. Technology should assist spiritual development, not confine people, more and more, within a materialistic world, as is happening now on your planet... To an even greater extent, your people are obsessed with a single goal - affluence. Their lives are concerned with all that the pursuit of wealth entails; envy, jealousy, hatred of those richer and contempt for those poorer. In other words your technology, which is nothing compared with what existed on Earth more than 14,500 years ago, is dragging your civilization down, and pushing it closer and closer to moral and spiritual catastrophe.’ I noticed that each time this great personage spoke of materialism, his Aura and those of his acolytes, flashed with a dull and ‘dirty’ red, as though momentarily, they were in the middle of burning bushes. ‘We, the people of Thiaoouba, are assigned to assist, guide and sometimes punish the inhabitants of planets under our guardianship.’ Fortunately, Thao had briefed me on Earth’s history during our journey to Thiaoouba. Otherwise, I’d have surely fallen off my seat on hearing such a speech. ‘I think,’ he resumed, ‘that you already know what we mean by ‘harmful to the human race’. Many people on Earth believe atomic arms to be the major danger, but it is not so. The greatest danger concerns ‘materialism’. The people of your planet seek money - to some it’s a means of attaining power; to others it’s a means to acquire drugs (another curse), yet to others, it’s a way of possessing more than their neighbors possess... ‘Now, once and for always, we will teach you and provide you with what you French call ‘the key to the mystery’... As you have heard, in the beginning there was the Spirit alone and he created, by his immense force, all that exists materially. He created the planets, the suns, plants, animals, with one goal in mind: to satisfy his spiritual need. This is quite logical since he is purely spirit. Already I see you are wondering why the need to create material things in order to attain spiritual fulfillment. I offer this, by way of explanation: the creator sought spiritual experiences through a material world... In order to have these experiences, he wanted to embody a tiny part of his Spirit in a physical entity. To do this, he called on the Fourth force - the force which Thao has not yet spoken of and which concerns only spirituality. In this domain, Universal Law also applies. ‘You most certainly know that the pattern of the Universe dictates that nine planets revolve around their sun. It is also the case that these suns revolve around a bigger sun, which is the nucleus for nine such suns, and their nine planets... Certain accidents occur and sometimes a planet will disappear in a solar system, or perhaps enter it, but later in time, the solar system will revert and base its structure again on the number nine."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 173 ‘The Fourth force had a very important role to play: it had to bring to fruition all that the Spirit had imagined. It ‘inserted’ thus, an infinitesimal part of the Spirit in the human body. This comprises what you could call the Astral body, which forms one ninth of the essential human being and consists of one ninth of a ‘Higher-self’, which is sometimes called ‘overself'. The Higher-self of man is, in other words, an entity which sends one ninth of itself into a human body, becoming the person’s Astral being. Other physical bodies are inhabited, similarly, by other ninths of the same Higher-self and yet each part remains integral to the central entity... Further, the Higher-self is a ninth part of a superior Higher-self which, in turn, is a ninth part of a more superior Higher-self. The process continues as far back as the source, and allows the enormous filtration of spiritual experience required by the Spirit. ‘You must not think that the Higher-self of the first category is insignificant in comparison with the others. It functions at a lower level, but is nevertheless extremely powerful and important. It is capable of curing illness and even resuscitating the dead. There are many instances of people, declared clinically dead, who are brought back to life in the hands of doctors who had abandoned all hope for them. What generally happens in these cases, is that the person’s Astral body meets with the Higher-self. This portion of the Higher-self has left the physical body during the period of ‘death’. It perceives its physical body below, and the doctors trying to resuscitate it; it can also perceive loved ones who mourn for it. In his present state, the Astral body, the person will feel perfectly well –even blissful. Usually he abandons his physical body, frequently the source of much suffering, to find himself catapulted down a ‘psychic canal’, at the end of which is a wondrous light and beyond, a state of bliss. ‘If before passing through this canal into the blissful light which is his Higher- self he has the least will not to die –not on his own account but for the sake of those who need him, young children for example, he will ask to return. In certain cases it will be permitted... You are in constant communication with your Higher-self by means of your cerebral canal. Acting as a transmitting and receiving post, it conducts special vibrations directly bet ween your Astral body and your Higher-self. Your Higher-self monitors you continually, by day and by night and can intervene to save you from an accident."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 174 ‘Someone, for example, who is to catch a plane, finds that the taxi breaks down on the way to the airport; a second taxi called also breaks down - just like that... Could you really believe in such a coincidence? The plane in question crashes thirty minutes later, leaving no survivors. Another person, an old and rheumatic woman and barely able to walk, starts to cross a street. There is a loud horn blast and a screeching of tires, but this person is miraculously able to leap to safety. ‘How is this explained? It was not yet her time to die and so her Higher-self intervened. In one hundredth of a second the Higher-self triggered a reaction in her adrenaline glands, which, for a few seconds, provided enough strength to her muscles to enable her to execute the leap which saved her life. Adrenaline released into the blood can make it possible to flee from imminent danger, or to defeat the ‘unbeatable’ through anger or fear. In too strong a dose, however, adrenaline becomes a lethal poison. ‘It isn’t only the cerebral canal which is able to conduct messages between the Higher- self and the Astral body. Another channel exists sometimes in dreams –or, I should even say, in sleep. At certain times during sleep, your Higher-self is able to call your Astral body to itself and, either communicate instructions or ideas, or to regenerate it in some way, replenishing its spiritual strength or enlightening it in regard to solutions to important problems. For this reason, it is essential your sleep is undisturbed by intrusive noise or by nightmares resulting from harmful impressions received during the day. Perhaps you w ill better understand the importance of your old French saying: ‘Night brings counsel’. ‘The physical body in which you exist at the moment is already very complex, but still, it is nothing compared with the complexity of the process of evolvement which occurs with Astral bodies and Higher-selves. In order to allow ordinary people on your planet to understand as easily as possible, I will make my explanation in the simplest terms... Your Astral body, which inhabits every normal human being, transfers to its Higher-self all the sensations that are experienced during a lifetime in a physical body. These sensations pass through the immense ‘filter’ of nine Higher-selves before arriving in the etheric ‘ocean’ that surrounds the Spirit. If these sensations are based essentially on materialism, the Higher-selves have enormous trouble filtering them, just as a water filter clogs quicker if it filters dirty water than if the water was already clear... ‘If, through the numerous experiences you have in your life, you ensure your Astral body benefits in a spiritual sense, it will acquire more and more spiritual understanding. In time, which can vary from 500 to even 15,000 of your Earth years, your Higher-self will have nothing more to filter... "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 175 This part of itself, embodied in the Astral being of Michel Desmarquet, will be so spiritually advanced, it will have arrived at the next stage where it will have to contend directly with the more superior Higher-self... We can compare this process with a nine-stage filter, intended to rid the water passing through, of nine elements. At the end of stage one in the process, one will have been completely eliminated, with eight remaining. Of course, to make this information easier to digest, I am making enormous use of imagery... ‘This Astral body then, will have completed its cycle with the Higher-self of the first category and will then detach itself from Higher-self number one to rejoin the Higher-self of the second category; the entire process will be repeated. By the same token, the Astral body will be sufficiently spiritually advanced to pass to a planet of the next category, as well... ‘In his wisdom, The Spirit, by means of the Fourth force, provided for nine categories of planets. At present, you are on the planet Thiaoouba which is in the ninth category; that is, at the top of the scale... Earth is a planet of the first category and therefore at the bottom of the scale. What does this mean? The planet Earth could be likened to a kindergarten with the emphasis on teaching basic social values. A planet of the second category would then correspond with a primary school where further values are taught - in both schools, adult guidance is imperative. The third category would comprise secondary schools where a foundation of values allows exploration beyond. Next, you would go to university, where you are treated as an adult, for you would not only have attained a certain amount of knowledge, but you would also start to accept civic responsibility. ‘This is the type of progress occurring with the nine categories of planets. The more spiritually advanced you are, the more you will benefit, on a superior planet, by an environment and general way of life which is superior. The very way in which you procure food is much easier, which in turn, simplifies the process of organizing your way of life; the consequence is more effective spiritual development. On the higher planets, Nature itself, enters the stage to assist ‘the pupil’ and, by the time you reach planets of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth category, not only is your Astral body highly evolved, your physical body has also benefited from your development. ‘We know you have already been favorably impressed by what you have seen on our planet. As you see more, you will appreciate that it is what you would call on Earth, ‘a paradise’; and yet, compared with true happiness, when you become a pure spirit, it is still nothing... From this planet, it is possible either to remain in a physical body or be reunited with the Great Spirit in the ether.’ As these words were uttered, the Aura surrounding the leader shone more brightly than ever and I was surprised to see him almost disappear in a golden mist, only to reappear a second later. ‘You have understood that the Astral body is a body which inhabits your physical body recalling and noting all the understanding acquired during the course of its various lives... It can only be enriched spiritually - not materially. The physical body is merely a vehicle which, in most cases we abandon when we die... I will elaborate, for I see that ‘in most cases’ has confused you. By this, I mean that some of us, including all on our planet, are able to regenerate the cells of our bodies at will. Yes, you have already noticed that most of us seem to be of the same age. We are one of three planets that are the most highly evolved in this galaxy. Some of us can, and do, directly join what we call the great ether."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" 176 ‘So, on this particular planet, we have arrived at a stage near perfection, both materially and spiritually. But we have our roles to perform, as does every creature existing in the universe; in fact, everything, including a single pebble, has its role... Our role, as beings of a superior planet, is to guide – to help with spiritual development and even, sometimes, materially. We are in a position to give material assistance because we are technologically the most advanced people. Indeed, how could a father give spiritual guidance to his child if he were not older, more educated and more skilled in diplomacy than the child? If the child should require physical punishment, as unfor- tunately, is sometimes the case, isn’t it important that the parent be physically stronger than the child? Certain adults, who refuse to listen and who are absolutely stubborn, also need to be corrected by physical means.‘ ‘You, Michel, come from the planet Earth, which is sometimes called ‘The Planet of Sorrows’. Indeed, the name is appropriate, but it is this way for a precise reason - it is intended to provide a learning environment of a quite specific kind. It is not because life there is so difficult that you have to intervene - you cannot lightly go against Nature, destroying rather than conserving what the Creator has put at your disposal; that is, interfering with ecological systems, which have been intricately designed. Certain countries, like Australia, where you are from, are beginning to show great respect for ecology and it is a step in the right direction; but even in that country, what case is made of pollution - both water and air pollution? What is ever done about one of the worst forms of pollution? Noise. [Damage to sensitive auditory cells in the cochlea, seen below, is but one of many dangers.] ‘I say ‘worst’ be- cause people such as Australians pay virtually no attention to it at all... Ask someone if traffic noise bothers him and the response will surprise you - eighty five percent of the time it will be; ‘What noise? What are you talking about? Oh that noise - we get used to it.’ And it is precisely because they ‘get used to it’ that the danger exists.’ Just then, Thaora, as this high figure was called, made a gesture and I turned around. He was replying to a question I had mentally posed; ‘How can he speak of percentages and know so much about our planet with so much precision?’ Turning around, I almost uttered a cry of surprise for, behind me, stood Biastra and Latoli. In itself, this was nothing surprising, but the friends I knew who measured 310 and 280 centimeters in height respectively, were now reduced in size to correspond with my height. My mouth must have continued to gape, for Thaora smiled. ‘Can you understand, that sometimes, and very often in these days, some of us live among your people on Earth? - and there is my answer to your question. To continue on the very important subject of noise, it is such a danger that, if nothing is done, catastrophe is certain... Let us take the example of a discotheque. The people who expose themselves to music that is typically played three times too loudly, are subjecting their brains and their physiological and astral bodies to vibrations which are so harmful. If they could see the damage that is caused, they would vacate the discotheque quicker than if there was a fire. ‘But vibrations don’t only come from noise; they also come from colors and it is astonishing that, on your planet, experiments conducted in this field have not been followed up. 16 Our ‘agents’ reported a particular experiment involving a man who was capable of lifting a certain weight. It was found that after staring for a moment at a pink-colored screen, he consistently lost thirty percent of his strength... Your civilization pays no attention to such experimentation. In fact, colors can enormously influence the behavior of human beings and yet, control of this influence requires that an individual’s Aura be taken into account. If for example, you want to paint or wallpaper your bedroom with the colors that are truly appropriate for you, you must be aware of the colors of certain principal points of your Aura. "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 177 "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 178 ‘By matching the colors of your walls with those of your Aura, you can improve your health or maintain good health. Further, the vibrations emanating from these colors are essential for good mental balance, exerting their influence even while you sleep.’ I was wondering how we could be expected to know these significant colors in our Auras when, on Earth, we were not capable of perceiving Auras... Thaora replied immediately, without me having to say a word aloud. ‘Michel, it is now very important that your experts invent the special equipment necessary, to enable perception of the Aura, as this, in turn, will ensure that correct choices are made at the critical crossroads ahead... The Russians have already photographed the Aura [as Kirlian photography – seen above, opposite]. This is the beginning, but the results obtained allow them only to read the first two letters of the alphabet, as it were, in comparison with what we are able to decipher. The reading of the Aura in order to heal the physical body is nothing compared with what such a reading can achieve for the psychic body, or the physiological body. It is in the area of the psyche that, on Earth, your greatest problems exist. ‘At the moment, most responsibility is taken for the physical body, but this is a serious mistake. If your psyche is poor, it will influence your physical appearance accordingly, but, regardless, your physical body will wear out and die one day, whereas your psyche, being part of your Astral body, never dies. On the contrary, the more you cultivate your mind, the less you will be burdened by your physical body and the quicker you will proceed through your cycle of lives... We could have brought you to our planet in Astral body, but instead, we have brought you here in physical body - and for an important reason. I see you already understand our reason. This pleases us and we thank you for your willingness to assist us in our task.’ The Thaora stopped talking and seemed to lapse into thought, at the same time, fixing me with his luminous eyes. I cannot say how much time elapsed. I know my state became more and more euphoric and I was aware that the Auras of the seven personages were gradually changing. The colors became more vivid in places, softer in others, while the outer edges became misty. This mist became more golden and pink as it spread, gradually blurring the seven figures. 17 "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 179 The profound wealth of imagery, wisdom and spiritual knowledge transmitted by the Thaori during the fourth-density plasma experiences of Michel Desmarquet on the golden planet of Thiaoouba resonate with the highest teachings available to Earthly humanity. The importance of Aura photography, known as Kirlian photography among Russian biophysicists and referred to as ‘electro-photonics’ by Thao, is decisive in not only the deepening of our understanding of the effects of color on human perception, but as well it represents the beginning of high-energy applications of HHO plasma to the human body. While clearly visible gaps in electrical conductivity observed along the fingertips has already shown promise in reflecting the state of health of specific organs (quite useful in diagnostic readings), the more advanced beam healing systems now biocompatible and effective in rapid cellular rejuvenation. While the field of dentistry now applies nanosecond electrical pulses to ionize the HHO plasma at low temperatures to form biocompatible helium/oxygen plasmas for oral cleaning and sterilization, 18 an unnoticed effect of cellular regeneration is also occurring. The application of HHO plasma to the cleansing of the human body promises a significant reduction in the rate of cellular aging when the proper sources of lightwater (protium) are ingested. The bioelectric effect of electroporation, whereby cellular permeability is significantly lowered by rapid, milliampere electrical pulses, and can be only be generated throughout all of the body’s cells using electroluminescent gold and silver nanoparticles. Natural safeguards for immersion in the fourth-density HHO plasma environment provide for a limit to 9 full days of exposure, as succinctly explained to Michel by another temporary visitor to the golden Thiaoouba. The intense luminosity of the atmospheric HHO plasma inevitably intoxicates low-resonance human bodies:"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 180 ‘An Astral body absolutely cannot change to a superior planet until sufficiently evolved [in spirit]... This evolution occurs thanks to the physical body that improves as it progresses right up as far as this planet. You have already learned of the nine categories of planets –ours are at the bottom of the scale. We, in our present physical bodies, can be permitted only nine days’ stay here. According to Universal Law, on the tenth day, our physical bodies would die and neither Thao nor the great Thaora, within whose power it is to revive the dead, would be able to prevent or reverse the process. Nature has very inflexible rules with well-established safeguards... But it is possible that when you do die on Earth –when your moment has come– your Astral body will reincarnate in a body on... a second or perhaps third category planet... [Through reincarnation] we must be ‘reprocessed’ over and over until we emerge perfect, for eventually we will rejoin The Spirit who, being perfect himself, cannot accept the slightest imperfection.’ Around each planet, since its creation, is a kind of psychosphere or vibratory cocoon, which turns at a speed seven times that of light [or 1,302,000 miles per second]. This cocoon acts as a blotter, as it were, absorbing (and remembering) absolutely every event occurring on the planet... The human being, comprising an integral part of the universe can, because of his Astral body and if he is correctly trained, draw what knowledge he seeks from within the psychosphere. Of course, great training is required for this. 19 This description of the psychosphere corresponds closely with the ancient Sanskrit concept of the akashic field , the mnemonic body of the planet that spirals around the Earth through the pathways of standing infrasound waves (illustrated above). The (Van Allen) plasma belt that encompasses Earth possesses superfluid crystalline properties that may act as a form of cosmic memory storage."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 181 The subconscious mind is in constant contact with the planetary psychosphere where all the information of all past and future lives is stored, as elucidated by the Sleeping Prophet Edgar Cayce, in so many astoundingly advanced spiritual readings from the era of the industrial revolution.

He passed through what certain Nagas have called ‘The River of Oblivion’ - this happens whether one accepts or rejects a possible reincarnation. Of course, there is a reason for it."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 182 ‘If, for example, you remembered that, around forty years of age, you would lose your wife and two cherished children in a car accident and that you, yourself, would be confined to a wheelchair, the knowledge could tempt you to take your life rather than face up to your troubles, or it might lead you to behave badly in other spheres. So, the ‘film’ is erased, in something like the way you ‘wipe out’ a tape recording. ‘Occasionally, by accident, the machine does not erase everything and you can hear brief portions of what should have been erased. Of course, my analogies are fanciful when I speak of ‘films’ and ‘tape recordings’ but I hope they give you an idea of what I am trying to explain. In reality, the process involves electro-photonics, which mean nothing, yet, to people on Earth. This, in fact, occurs often in the ‘films’ that the Higher-self shows to an Astral body, which is why most people say, on several occasions in the course of their lives ‘I have seen that before’ or ‘I have heard that before’ and they know what the very next action or word will be. In English, people call this feeling ‘déjà vu’.’ 20 ‘Miche l... you were chosen by us to visit Thiaoouba, but the essential motive for our choice has not been revealed. It is not only because you have a mind already awakened and open, but also –and principally– because you are one of the rare soukous inhabiting Earth at the present time. A ‘soukou’ is an Astral body that has lived eighty-one lives in human physical bodies, and has lived those lives on different planets or different categories. For various reasons, the ‘soukous’ return to live on inferior planets, like Earth, when they could just as well continue to ‘climb the ladder’ without ever going backwards. You know that the number nine is the number of the Universe. You are here in the City of Nine Dokos, founded on Universal Law. Your Astral body has nine times nine lives, which brings you to the end of one of the great cycles.’ Once again, I was completely flabbergasted. I suspected I wasn’t living my first life... – but eighty-one lives! I didn’t know one lived so many... ‘It’s possible to live many more, Michel,’ said the Thaora, interrupting my thoughts. ‘Thao is up to her 216 th , but other entities live far fewer. As I said, you have been chosen from among very few ‘soukous’ living on Earth, but, in order that you acquire a thorough understanding during the trip to our planet, we have planned another journey in time for you. So that you will better understand what reincarnation is, and what its purpose is, we will permit you to revisit your previous existences. This journey in time will be useful to you when writing your book as you will fully comprehend its purpose.’ 21 "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 183 Absolutely all of the events of past lives are stored within the psychosphere and remain accessible to highly attuned adepts of meditation. The ancient pyramid technologies were developed to enhance the psychoacoustic conditions that engender synesthesia , a form of holographic consciousness. The global network of ancient pyramids function as one synchronous unit, balancing the biorhythms of initiates into telepathic communication with other worlds : ‘I must finish off my story concerning the continent of Mu... Savanasa then, was situated on a vast plateau overlooking plains which rose, on average, no more than 30 meters above sea level. On this plateau and in the centre, an enormous pyramid was constructed. Each stone used in its construction, some weighing more than 50 tons, was cut precisely to within one fifth of a millimeter, using what we can call ‘ultrasonic vibratory systems’. [These ultrasonic pulse cutting techniques were developed by scientists in 2009. 22 ] This was done in the quarries of Holaton, now found on Easter Island, which was the one place on the entire continent where this special rock could be found. There was, however, another quarry at Notora, southwest of the continent. ‘The enormous stones were transported using anti-gravitational techniques well known to these people. (They were carried on platforms, 20 centimeters above the paved roads, and were constructed using the same principals as those of the pyramids.) Roads such as these were built all over the country, converging, like a massive spider’s web, on the capital, Savanasa. ‘The huge stones were taken to Savanasa and put into position according to directions from the ‘master’ or chief architect on the project. When finished, the pyramid measured exactly 440.01 meters in height and its four faces were oriented precisely towards the four points of the compass [as seen above].’ ‘Wa s this intended to be the King’s palace, or his tomb?’ Everyone wore the same indulgent smile that often appeared when I asked a question."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 184 ‘Nothing of the sort, Michel. This pyramid was much more important - it was a tool. An enormous tool, I admit, but a tool just the same. So, too, was the Pyramid of Cheops, in Egypt, though it was much smaller... You will have realized... these were highly advanced people. They possessed a profound understanding of Universal Law and used their pyramid as a ‘captor’ of cosmic rays, forces and energies, as well as terrestrial energies ... Inside, rooms positioned according to a precise plan, served the King and certain other great initiates, a s powerful communications centers, enabling (telepathic) communication with other planets and other worlds in the universe. Such communication with extraterrestrials is no longer possible for people on Earth; but the people of Mu in those days, by natural means and by exploiting cosmic forces, were in constant communication with other beings and were even able to explore parallel universes... [The pyramid’s] second use was to make rain. By a system of plates, made of a special alloy incorporating silver as its major component, these people were able, in a few days, to cause the accumulation of clouds above the country, and so, to have rain... Thus, they were able to create, virtually, a paradise over the whole continent. Rivers and springs never dried up, but flowed lazily across the numerous plains of a land that was essentially flat. Fruit trees were laden with fruit, bowing under the weight of oranges, mandarins or apples, according to latitude. Exotic fruits, of kinds that... no longer exist on Earth, were harvested in abundance.’ 23 In describing interior “rooms positioned according to a precise plan,” Thao is making reference to the nonlinear structure of Fibonacci standing waves by which the precise positions of the pyramids’ chambers were determined, for the purpose of focusing terrestrial infrasound resonance (above). Telepathic communication was established by biorhythmic entrainment at 1.45 Hz heartbeat, also known as the tri-thalamic entrainment frequency , by which the biorhythms of initiates using the pyramid chambers are synchronized with those initiates in other pyramids across the world, or indeed with other planetary civilizations. Infrasound stimulation also provided for the secondary purpose of rainmaking, by drastically increasing the evaporation and precipitation rates , just as occurs during solar flare activity. Biorhythmic balancing in the pyramids also greatly benefits the Astral body, composed of electrons:"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 185 ‘Now we come to another kind of pollution that is of no small concern, though people might readily dismiss it. As the great Thaora told you, noise is one of the most noxious pollutants for it upsets your electrons and unbalances your physical compartment. I haven’t yet mentioned these electrons to you and I see that you are not following me very well... A normal human Astral body contains approximately four billion, trillion electrons [4.0 x 10 21 = 4 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 electrons]. These electrons have a life span of approximately ten billion, trillion of your years [10 22 = 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 years]. They were created at the moment of creation. Your Astral body contains them and, when you die, nineteen per cent rejoin the electrons of the universe until required by Nature to form a new body or a new tree or animal, and the eighty one per cent rejoin your Higher-self.’ ‘I don’t quite follow you,’ I interrupted. ‘I know, but I intend helping you to understand. An Astral body is not quite what you would call a pure spirit. On Earth, there is a belief that the spirit is made of nothing. This is false. The Astral body is composed of billions of electrons, exactly marrying your physical shape. Each of these electrons has a ‘memory’ and each is capable of retaining as much information as is contained in all the books that fill the shelves of an average town library. ‘I see you are staring wide-eyed at me, but it is as I say. This information is coded, like a microfilm containing all the plans of an industrial installation that a spy would be able to pass in a cufflink, though much more miniaturized than that. Certain physicists on Earth are now aware of this fact but the public, at large, hasn’t been informed of it. Your Astral body transmits and receives messages, by means of these electrons, through the channel of your brain, to, and from your Higher-self. Information is being transmitted without you being aware of it, thanks to a weak electric current from your brain in harmony with your electrons. ‘Since it is the Higher-self which sent this Astral body into your physical body, it is in the natural order of things that your Higher-self should receive information from your Astral body."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 186 ‘Like all things electronic, the Astral body – tool of the Higher-self – is quite a delicate tool. During your waking hours it is capable of sending messages of extreme urgency to the Higher-self but the Higher-self seeks much more than that. So, during sleep, your Astral body leaves your physical body to rejoin the Higher-self, either passing on required information or receiving information or orders... Now, those people who, through very advanced and special exercises, are able to detach their astral bodies from their physical bodies, will be able to see a light, silvery-blue thread, such as you saw yourself, linking their physical and astral bodies. Their Astral bodies, likewise, are visible during the time that the separation lasts. It is these same electrons which form your Astral body and which create the visible effect of the thread. ‘I see that you follow what I am saying and that you have grasped my point. Let me finish by explaining the dangers of noise. Noise directly attacks the electrons of your Astral body creating parasites, to use a radio and television term. If... someone is operating an electric tool next door to your house, such large parasites will be produced on your screen that the image will distort completely. ‘The same thing occurs with the Astral body, but unfortunately you won’t be aware of it in the same way that you are with a television screen; and, it’s much worse, since noise damages your electrons. And yet people say: ‘Oh, we get used to it.’ Yo ur brain ‘tenses’, so to speak and your psyche initiates self-defense mechanisms, but not so the Astral body; a parasite invades its electrons - which, of course, has disastrous repercussions for your Higher-self. ‘The sounds that reach your ears are clearly very important. A particular piece of music can elevate you to a state of euphoria, while another piece, although very pretty, will have no effect on you or, perhaps, irritate you. Try an experiment: take a piece of soft violin, piano or flute music that you like and play it as loudly as you can. The suffering of your eardrums will not be as great as the discomfort you’ll feel within. Most of your fellow human beings on Earth consider noise pollution to be of negligible concern, but the noise of the exhaust pipe of a motor bike is three to four times worse than the noxious fumes that it discharges. While the fumes affect your throat and your lungs, the noise affects your Astral body... However, no one has ever been able to take a photograph of your Astral body and, so, people don’t concern themselves with it!’ 24 Thao’s lengthy description of the Astral or electronic body brings sharp clarity to the issue of noise pollution in the industrialized world. The remarkable descriptive metaphor of electronic parasites was powerfully used to illustrate the invisible effect of the dangerous distortion caused by the incessant bombardment of disruptive oscillations from modern airplane, truck and automobile traffic. Not mentioned at the time of Desmarquet’s contact in 1987, which occurred before the mass-production of wireless devices, the lethal effects of long-term exposure of DNA to microwave radiation has since become another invisible threat to all life, mirroring the atmospheric devastation caused by combustion engines: "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 187 ‘For approximately one hundred and forty years on your planet, man has been accelerating the destruction of Nature and the pollution of the environment. This has happened since the discovery of steam power and the combustion engine. You have but a few years left in which to arrest the pollution before the situation becomes irreversible. One of the principal pollutants on Earth is the petrol-driven engine and this could be replaced immediately with a hydrogen engine that would cause no pollution, so to speak. On certain planets, this is called the ‘clean motor’. Prototypes for such an engine have been constructed by various engineers on your planet [including John Keely (above) and Nikola Tesla among others,] but they must be industrially manufactured in order to replace petrol engines. Not only would this measure mean a seventy percent reduction in current levels of pollution by combustion waste, but it would also be more economical for consumers. ‘The big petrol corporations had been terrified at the idea of this motor being popularized for it would mean loss of sales for their oil and subsequent financial ruin. Governments, too, who impose enormous taxes on these oils, would suffer equally. You see, Michel, it always comes back to money. Because of it, you have a whole economic and financial context that opposes progress towards radical change in the interest of all human life on Earth. The people on Earth allow themselves to be pushed around, bullied, exploited and led to the abattoirs by political and financial cartels which are sometimes even associated with well-known sects and religions. When these cartels fail to win the people with clever advertising campaigns intended to brainwash them, they try to succeed through political channels, and next through religion or through a clever blend of the lot. ‘Great men wanting to do something for mankind have simply been done away with. Martin Luther King is one example; Ghandi is another. But the people of Earth can no longer allow themselves to be treated as fools and led to the abattoirs like flocks of sheep by leaders that they, themselves, have democratically elected. The people form the vast majority. In a nation of one hundred million inhabitants, it is absurd that a group of financiers com- prising perhaps a thousand individuals can decide the fate of the others - like the butcher does at the abattoir. ‘Such a group has well and truly stifled the business of the hydrogen motor so that it is no longer mentioned... These people couldn’t care less what might happen to your planet in years to come. Selfishly, they seek their gains, expecting to be dead before ‘whatever is going to happen’ happens. If the Earth disappears, as a result of horrific cataclysms, they assume they will already be dead."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 188 ‘There, they are making a big mistake, for the source of the coming disasters is the pollution which is growing daily on your planet, and its consequences will be felt very soon - much sooner than you can imagine. The people of Earth must not do as the child forbidden to play with fire; the child is without experience and, in spite of the prohibition, he disobeys and burns himself. Once burnt, he ‘knows’ that the adults were right. He won’t play with fire again but he will pay for his disobedience by suffering... Unfortunately, in the case that concerns us, the consequences are much more serious than the burn of a child. It’s the destruction of your entire planet that is at risk - with no second chance if you don’t place your trust in those who want to help you. ‘It interests us to see that recently established ecological movements are gaining in momentum and power; and that the young people of Earth are ‘carrying’ other sensible people along with them in their fight against pollution... There is only one solution... the grouping of individuals. A group is only as powerful as it is large. Those whom you call the conservationists are becoming stronger and stronger and will continue to do so. But it is vital that people forget their hated, their resentment, and especially their political and racial differences. This group must be internationally united – and don’t tell me that is so difficult - for already on Earth there exists a non -violent and very large international organization – the International Red Cross, which has been functioning effectively for quite some time. It is essential that this conservationist group include in its programs not only the conservation of the environment from direct damage but from indirect damage as well, such as that which results from smoke: exhaust fumes from vehicles, smoke from factories, and so on. ’ 25 The immediate and dire consequences of the continued acoustic and atmospheric pollution of Earthy humanity could not have been more clearly stated. The hydrogen engine that Thao speak s of was discovered a century ago by Earthly scientist s − most notably by John Worrell Keely (above) and Nikola Tesla. As in the mentioned cases of Martin Luther King and Ghandi, Tesla was also assassinated 26 and his technologies stolen to be secretly developed by Nazi scientists. 27 Recent rediscoveries by Dr. Randall Mills define hydrino resonant-transfer plasma, formed by the ionization of HHO gas using metal particles (opposite). 28 These facts concerning the clean HHO plasma motor must become widely known and used.

Ask them also to explain the second disappearance of billions more ‘needles’ again put into orbit. They will know what you are referring to, never fear. We are responsible for the disappearance of these ‘needles’, judging them to be potentially disastrous for your planet... We do, at times, prevent your experts from ‘playing with matches’ but it is important that our assistance not be relied upon when mistakes are made. If we judge it appropriate to ‘lend a hand’, we do so, but we can’t, and we don’t wish to save you from disaster automatically - that would be to contravene Universal Law.’ 29 The disappearance of millions of needles in orbit described by Thao as direct evidence of the reality of the extraterrestrial prevention of disasters caused by human scientific ignorance is a powerful reminder of the fragility of our planet and the carelessness of Earthly scientists. Dangerous experimentation of this kind has subsequently led to high atmospheric use of radioactive aluminum and barium nanoparticles dispersed as ‘chemtrails’ for atmospheric and psychological manipulation. Photo-ionization of the particles generates HHO plasma by the high-energy splitting of water molecules in the near vacuum of space, which acts as an amplifier of land-based signals beamed from the HAARP array, creating a bounce-back effect for ultra-low frequency wave focusing used in the artificial generation of earthquakes. While extraterrestrial overseers have not brought a halt to the secret development and use of dangerous infrasonic technologies by Earth’s psychopathic profiteers, rare interventions do occur when catastrophic situations arise. In proving the benevolent interventions of Thiaoouban spacecraft observing Earth, Thao referred to two senseless tests in near-Earth orbit in October of 1961 and May of 1963 that were carried out as part of Lincoln Laboratory’s Project West Ford, 30 which involved a potentially disastrous attempt to create a new method of military communications using an artificial ‘dipole belt’ around the Earth:"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 190 The dipole belt was to serve, in effect, an artificial ionosphere... [by artificially creating] a belt of 480 million dipoles orbiting 2,200 miles above the earth... In addition to judiciously specifying the initial orbit parameters, we gave the dipoles a high area- to-mass ratio to ensure that the solar radiation pressure acting on the dipoles would distort their circular orbits into highly elliptical ones. The orbital perigee would eventually dip to an altitude at which air resistance would sweep the dipoles out of orbit... The first attempt at establishing the dipole belt, in October 1961, failed. The dipole-dispenser ejection mechanism didn’t spin up, so no dipoles were released. With a redesigned dipole dispenser, a dipole belt was established in May 1963... By late 1965, the dipole belt had been swept from orbit, right on schedule. 31 The Lincoln Laboratory photograph of 7 of the tiny dipole needles– 0.7” long and 0.0007” in diameter – (above) confounds the ability of the human mind to imagine the total volume of 480 million of these needles, which could easily have caused major damage to the Earth if allowed to melt together during atmospheric reentry to form several large molten masses that would rain down on the Earth in a series of major catastrophic impacts. The extreme myopia of the faulty thought process that directed this dangerous experiment is characteristic of ‘government scientists’ who endanger our planet by ignorant interference in natural atmospheric and orbital processes. Prevention of the first mission’s release of the dipole belt was achieved by interference with the functioning of the dipole-dispenser ejection mechanism. This simple preventive measure only frustrated NASA scientists, who mounted a second mission that was allowed to be released, and the experiment conducted, before the dipole belt was disintegrated by the plasma beams of Alatora spacecraft for the protection of all life on Earth.

Never forget that we have TH E knowledge - you have not seen one-tenth of what we can do. Attend carefully and I will give you a few examples to help you understand what I’m going to tell you.’ Thao stopped talking and appeared to be concentrating. As I watched, her face became a blur and, instinctively, I rubbed my eyes. Of course, this did not help and, in fact, she became progressively transparent until I could see right through her. Finally, she was no longer there - she had completely disappeared. ‘Thao,’ I called, slightly concerned, ‘where are you?’ ‘Here, Michel.’ I jumped, for the voice came as a whisper, quite close to my ear... Several feet in front of me, I saw the silhouette of Thao, completely golden yet radiant, as though inside her there burned a fire, its flames brief but intense. As for her face, it was recognizable but her eyes seemed to send forth little rays each time she spoke ... She began to rise a few feet above the ground, without having moved a muscle of her ‘body’; then she started to circle the room, so fast I had trouble keeping my eyes on her. She stopped, eventually, above her seat and sat her ghostly form down. It was as though she were made of a shining mist - she was still recognizable as Thao and yet, quite transparent. The next instant she was gone. I looked around, but she had completely vanished. ‘Look no further, Michel, I am back.’ Indeed, there she was, in flesh and bone again, sitting on her seat. ‘How do you do that?’ ‘As I was just explaining to you, we have THE knowledge . We can revive the dead; cure the deaf and the blind; make people walk who are paralyzed; we can cure any malady you care to name. We are masters, not of Nature, but in Nature, and we can do the thing most difficult of all - we can generate life spontaneously. ‘Out of the release of cosmic ray, we can create any type of living creature, including man... We can create a human body, but that is done only by the great Thaori, taking infinite care, for the human body must be inhabited by several bodies, as you are aware - the physiological, the astral etc. If not, it would merely be a robot. Perfect knowledge is therefore required for such an undertaking... A man of twenty or thirty years- of-age can be created by the Thaori in approximately twenty-four of your Earth hours.’ 32 The astounding disclosures of spiritual knowledge provided through the writings of Michel Desmarquet inspire great contemplation. The transdimensional demonstrations and many penetrating truths offered by both Thao and the Thaori reflect their purely Creational consciousness, as masters in Nature . Michel’s galactic voyage to the golden planet of Thiaoouba stands as an example of the highest attainment of Nature, inspiring the human beings of Earth to reverse the destructive effects of our ignorant ways by the advanced spiritual use of gold and silver nanoparticles for resonant atmospheric and intracellular illumination (at left). The seeds of knowledge have been widely sown, and hold the magnificent promise of an era of rejuvenation using electrum-enriched foods and drinks to reclaim our own natural ability ‘to regenerate the cells of our bodies at will’ in the enhanced cosmic ray environment of the Betelgeuse supernova blast. At this juncture, the development of human consciousness on Earth will benefit from dramatic cosmic environmental changes, ‘as Nature itself enters the stage to assist the pupil’ in the attainment of knowledge. Thiaoouban wisdom concerning the Four Forces of Creation, the Atomic, Ovocosmic, Ovoastromic and Astral, has been offered for our contemplation on Earth as all living beings receive DNA enhancements induced by cycling galactic infrasound waves. Their lessons identify the significant advances of Kirlian photography and the clean hydrogen engine as crucial developments for terrestrial technology on Earth, pointing directly toward the use of biocompatible HHO plasma for cellular regeneration, enhanced longevity and an inexhaustible source of clean, resonant energy.

Ancient Sanskrit knowledge maintained by the Maya culture explicitly describes the events surrounding the end of this solar cycle, as retold in many forms throughout the indigenous prophecies and wisdom traditions of the world. It is said humanity will be transformed in the red light of cosmic consciousness – quite directly telling us ‘man becomes god.’ Mayan wisdom identifies the energetic changes of December 22, 2012 as the effect of a synchronization ray emitted from the center of the galaxy. This event is described as an ali gnment of Earth with the galactic plane, which will ignite Earth’s high atmosphere in an all -encompassing red aurora. The Pyramid of Fire Codex foretells that the sky itself will be in flames, and the red flames will spread amongst the pyramids – from one ‘Hill of the Star’ to another along flaming plumes of celestial water: Tláloc, God of Celestial Water, god of the vapor that rises , from the E arth warmed by the sun after the rains, god of the mist that ascends from the valleys at dawn... Tláloc is the retu rn of vapor that strains to rise, is the return of time that strains to remember . Tláloc, God of the Fight Against the Current, with whose aid the hero battles against the torrent toward his own origin and beginning, towards the wings of his soul, the wing s that Tláloc hides in the hero’s past... It is the self within ourselves that we have to sacrifice. It is our own heart that has to be torn out of the false being and offered to the light. May Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of Fire, burn my false being, May Itzli, Obsidian Knife, liberate my heart. To sow life in the fires of sacrifice: Are the flames rising on the Hill of the Star, toward Cauhlacan? Or is it my own heart that is afire? The cycle of years is past - the waiting ended. Come - reunite, pilgrims, for the sky is in flames! From Xochicalco to Teotíhuacan the red spreads one step, another step, and another, only twelve short steps from the cave of the womb to the final conflagration... The flames rage in consummation - Rise, oh flames! What light, what heat! W hat great holocaust! The smoke ascends and spirals... Obscurity disappears as the flames rise to Tonatiuh, the purest light. 1 "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 195 The kundalini technology of the pyramids employs the crystalline memory of celestial waters to awaken human divinity at sacred temples like Teotihuacan, meaning ‘ site -w here- man -becomes -God’ (below). The resonant frequency of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan closely matches the 1.45 Hz heartbeat oscillation of the Great Pyramid due to its comparable base length of 740’. Itza Mayan Elder Hunbatz Men describes the pyramids as generators of the brilliant light of heaven that imbues the human being with eternal life. Cosmic Creator Hunab K’u guides the initiatic work of Mayan Elders at sacred pyramids: \"Take care of the light that I leave within my temple. When you f orm the human being, teach him to venerate my house, for within it they will find the light they need for eternal life. Teach him also that if he should stray, due to his errors, vices or ignorance, then I, Hunab K'u will reclaim my beloved beings and take them to my temple of wisdom and nourish them again with my light which is in the heavens. Then, together, Tepeu, Gugumatz and Huyubcaan will perform purification rituals using that brilliant light for the benefit of my beloved whom we created and molded, so they can live in the light of eternal wisdom.\" 2 A heavenly life -giving light radiating inside pyramid chambers is also related in hieroglyphic texts inscribed on the interior walls of the pyramids of Saqqara, Egypt. Profound details of the luminal and acoustic effects of the Great Pyramid transducer in full operation have been recorded in stone: House bright and dark of Heaven and Earth, for the [solar] ships put together; Great Pyramid, House of the gods with pointed peak; for Heaven- to-Earth it is g reatly equipped. House whose interior glows with a reddish Light of Heaven, pulsating a beam which reaches far and wide; its awesomeness touches the flesh... House of Eternity: its foundations are stones, the water; its great circumference is set in the cl ay. House the rightness of whose howling the Great -Ones -Who -See -and- Orbit bring down to rest... Mountain by which Utu ascends... whose deep insides men cannot penetrate. 3 Both the Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphs are descendant forms of the ancient logographic Sanskrit, as deciphered by epigrapher Dr. Kurt Schildmann (1909- 2001). This antediluvian proto- Sanskrit can be identified as the Atlantean script, having been found on all inhabited continents of the world on stone and ceramic artifacts dated to the Pleist ocene period – being over 12,000 years old. The pyramid traditions of these cultures of Atlantean descent provide us with stunningly explicit descriptions of future events tied into the ancient Sanskrit conception of water as the transformative agent of co nsciousness."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" 196 The Atlantean psychoacoustic technology of quartz crystal skulls reflects the Sanskrit tradition of augmenting consciousness through the purification and crystallization of the water within the human body. The refraction of light within the human body that is fueled by crystalline water enables the higher capacities of human consciousness by biorhythmic alignment at 1.45 Hz heartbeat entrainment in the pyramid chambers. The Great Pyramid’s upper chamber does not contain a sarcophagus – the granite box was actually a water -birthing resonator filled with celestial water. The closed shafts rising from the chambers are its “deep insides men cannot penetrate”, designed to focus infrasound heartbeats at 1.45 Hz into the tiny newborn infants. Usually born as twins, the infants’ skulls were elongated by this process. The celestial waters of La Maná, Ecuador (photographed above with several plasma orbs) and Tlacote, Mexico have been extensively studied for their astounding resonant properties. 4 Test results have shown the spring waters of La Maná and Tlacote have the highest water purity found anywhere in the world, containing virtually no salt or other dissolved solids. This in itself is remarkable, but tests have also identified trace amounts of g old and silver nanoparticles and an energy rating of over 1,000,000 on the Bovis scale. There is no modern technology capable of creating energize d waters like those flowing from the springs of La Maná and Tlacote. Thes e celestial waters are the nano techno logical product of the transdimensional civilization of Atlantis – the central component of the pyramid kundalini tradition of psychoacoustic gestation and water -birthing practices."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 197 Artifacts from the ancient Sanskrit sacred site in La Maná, Ecuador revea l the origin and use of these celestial waters as a technological product of the global pyramid system itself. Over 300 metal, stone and ceramic artifacts have been recovered, among which are diverse UV- fluorescent maps of standing wave resonance patterns within the electron, mineral calcite, and Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt. 5 The artifacts preserve logographic Sanskrit script, while their numerals from 1 to 10 are presented in fluorescent inlays adorning a set of 13 stone goblets precisely designed for water volume measurement. Among the artifacts found below the sacred site is a large stone lingam in the form of a kundalini cobra, engraved with complex UV -fluorescent inlaid patterns – as well as a gold psychoacoustic helmet, accompanied by dozens of ceramic figurines that show both adults and children using the helmets while barefoot for electrical contact to the pyramid. The largest stone artifact from La Maná is a breathtaking global map of the Earth with all the continents accurately depicted as the y were before the fall of Atlantis! Star maps on flat stone plates were inlaid with UV -fluorescent calcite mortars depicting the constellations surrounding Orion, with Betelgeuse (fluorescing in red) as one of the three large stars forming the Winter Triangle with Sirius and Procyon. This star map is also presented on the largest goblet (above, center). Celestial waters were the primary enablers of this advanced psychoacoustic Atlantean technology, by which human bodies became superconductors of electricit y. The suspension of gold and silver nanoparticles enhances the conductivity of the body by creating a pathway for electrical flow without shock. Shock waves do not form inside crystals for the crystal lattice distributes pressure evenly and the whole mass is set vibrating in unison. The celestial waters maintain the integrity of the body’s cells during exposure to the electrical currents inside the pyramids at resonance. The gold and silver nanoparticles are from 2 -10nm in size and act as transducers in the body, converting electrical pulses into light pulses . Gold nanoparticles scatter RED light inside all of the cells of the body . This is the key to understanding the words of the pyramid- builders concerning the “heavenly red light of eternal life”! The fact that these water sources are still flowing, and in fact greatly increasing their output with time, is primary evidence that the pyramids are automatically roaring to life with the input of infrasound energy from solar storms as we approach the full on set of the new solar age. These widespread effects are already being observed. ( Note: monatomic gold, aka white powder gold, does NOT scatter red light, and is not recommended!)"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 198 Golden waters and wisdom of the Chichimeca and Chichicastl cultures of Tlacot e, Mexico have been preserved by the Maya Elders, and presented through translation by Gerardo Aceves Quetza Sha: Tlacote is a great assembly point of the ancient gods where once existed the Golden City of the Golden Water, built by the Chichimeca and the Chichicastl. In other times, our ancestors left us transcendental information... Man has always been looking for something else, something that lives inside of him, and he recognized the inner light manifesting in his heart. It is this inner light that will cause the changes in humanity and that will make the dream come true, that the animal which is the human being will be able to live thousands of years. Man opens his heart to understand the revealing truth, creating consciousness and elevating his thought s. This process is necessary, because we must under stand and solve the enigmas of E arth and the planetary system, in order to develop in perfect conscience right from the beginning of creation. We meet thousands of phenomena in our life. Man calls this coincidence; spirit calls it cycles of comprehension in the evolution of man. Therefore, if a new race emerges to a new cycle of existence, this happens because the information imprinted in the subconscious of the Inner Self has been completed. All the in formation we need is imprinted in the subconscious of the inner self, so it may evolve according to its individual level, remembering who it is and knowing its task on E arth: 'AWAKEN, INNER SELF, and recognize your inner creation in order to understand the movements of the U niverse!' This is how the different races and religions developed in their particular states of evolution. Each religion in its particular language has accompanied us on a very important part of our path and accomplished the demands of a particular time. Now humanity is awakening to a new cycle of consciousness. A new race is born, constantly bringing in new knowledge and spheres of conscience, and being aware of the past, the present and the future... This message predicting the awakening of the Golden Water is sacred and was created and given to us by beings from other dimensions, so that other generations can be born, prepared for the great changes that will be produced from the center of the E arth. 6 Not only are the acoustic environmen ts enhanced at these sacred sites, but the quality of water is also correspondingly enhanced to become crystalline. These profound findings reveal the sophisticated yet invisible technologies that enhance human consciousness and longevity at these sites – for those who choose to live close to spirit and purify their bodies to be bathed in the energy of the pyramids. The red light scattering of golden celestial waters induces DNA enhancement through heartbeat synchronization."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 199 The ancient Hopi wisdom echoes that maintained by the Maya, describing the imminent shift from the second phase of Creation, during which the sun has shone yellow, to the third phase of Creation during which the Earth is bathed in red light: “The third phase of Creation is the time of t he red light, Talawva, the perfect light. Humanity then, having been fully formed and [crystallized,] proudly faces the Creator for the first time, to know the true warmth of love.” While the Hopi prophecies ascribe no calendar date to the coming of the red light of the new solar age, their wisdom perfectly harmonizes with that of the Mayan culture, with its profound and complex calendar system providing the end date of December 22, 2012. What could possibly trigger the dramatic changes in human consciousn ess, involving a shift in the light reaching Earth’s surface to a red hue? Solar physicists confirm the 11 -year cycle of solar activity corresponds with the 2012 end date, the last solar maximum having been recorded in 2001. At each solar maximum the sun’s magnetic field reverses, but what could possibly induce the Earth’s magnetic field to reverse with our sun? Recent stellar observations in 2009 reveal the hidden threads which link one star system’s fate with another. A research team at UC Berkeley has re cently reported data indicating the nearby red supergiant star Betelgeuse is shrinking in the process of imminent collapse: Betelgeuse is enshrouded by vast clouds of gas and dust, so measuring its size is difficult. To cut through this cocoon, Charles T ownes of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues used a set of telescopes that are sensitive to a particular wavelength of the star's infrared light. But the star's reach seems to be waning. New observations indicate the giant star has shrunk by more than 15 per cent since 1993. This could be a sign of a long -term oscillation in its size or the star's first death knells... The team used these instruments to measure the size of Betelgeuse's disc on the sky. Over a span of 15 years, the star's diameter seems to have declined from 11.2 to 9.6 AU (1 AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from the Earth to the sun)... The cause for this reduction is unknown, as it is unclear how red supergiants behave near the end of their lives. 7 One may easil y identify similar patterns in the energy fluctuations of both red supergiant Betelgeuse and our own small yellow Sol. The contraction and collapse of Betelgeuse is being mirrored on the Sun, which has seen a prolonged period of spotless inactivity for the period of 264 days preceding the appearance of Sunspot 1024 in July of 2009. Both stars dimming together represents the contraction before the full strike of the wave, as the supernova’s energetic blast wave reaches the Earth. "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 200 Plasma physicists proposing the Electric Universe theory have keenly observed the pulsed throughput of energy that generates the dynamics of stellar interactions, overturning the false notion of stars as independent thermonuclear generators with their own self -determined lifecycle. The lifecycles of stars are actually intertwined with the cycling waves of energy that traverse the spiral arms of our galaxy. Galactic waves are generated as pulsations of infrasound emitted from the center of our galaxy that traverse its arms, gaining momentum from the radiated energy of supernovae that are set off by the wave’s influence in a chain of events moving outward. Red supergiant Betelgeuse, at the shoulder of the constellation Orion (at left), is the nearest in a chain of supernova events along the expanding wave front, and acts as our local indicator by which we can estimate the arrival time of the galactic energy wave. Further analysis of the data obtained by the UC Berkeley team should also provide the rate of acceleration of the stellar co llapse and give us a fairly good estimate for the moment of supernova. Considering the fact that Betelgeuse is our close neighbor at about 600 light -years distance, this event has already occurred and the nova will be visible to us in just a few years time . So, when exactly will the electromagnetic wave hit Earth, and how will it affect us? Certainly, the Betelgeuse supernova will be seen as a major flash of light plainly visible even during the daylight hours. The supernova may shine very brightly for man y days. The more complex unfolding of events triggered by the supernova involve many factors not commonly understood by astrophysicists. For time indications of the potential hazards and benefits of these electromagnetic changes we must turn to the most an cient and most accurate calendar system known to man. Mayan wisdom gives us an exact date for the change of the ages (December 22, 2012), and an exact sign is given as well – the Red Sky. The Maya use of sacred celestial waters within the pyramids for he aling and longevity is an open invitation to sacrifice the false comforts of urban society that disrupt the natural acoustic environment and isolate people from electrical contact with the Earth. Industrial man finds dissonance and disease in concrete boxes, whereas resonance and longevity are to be found in the celestial waters and barefoot lifestyle practiced at sacred sites. The Maya invite us all to come together as one: “The cycle of years is past - the waiting ended. Come - reunite, pilgrims, for the sky is in flames! From Xochicalco to Teotíhuacan the red spreads one st ep, another step, and another...” Yaqui Elder Don Juan spoke of waiting for the 2012 event during his teachings to cultural anthropologist Carlos Castaneda, stating emphatically: “[As se ers] our case is a bit different, because we are at the end of our trail. We are not seeking anything... we go from day to day doing nothing. We are waiting. I will not tire of repeating this: we know that we are waiting and we know what we are waiting for. We are waiting for freedom!” 8 The progressive energetic changes currently raising human consciousness will cause fear and panic only for those who are unprepared, while many spiritually awakened individuals have been preparing for the Purification Day.

Two of these prophecies may already have come true. A number of people can predict the future, but few get the timing correct. \"Grandfathe r\" was an Apache wise man and scout, named Stalking Wolf, who grew up outside white man's influence. His many predictions not only came true in the manner he predicted, but also when he predicted... Grandfather had been wandering for several years and was well into his forties when the Vision of the four signs was given to him. He had just finished his third Vision Quest at the Eternal Cave when the Vision made itself known. He had been seated at the mouth of the cave, awaiting the rising Sun, when the spi rit of the warrior appeared to him. He felt as if he were in a state somewhere between dream and reality, sleep and wakefulness, until the spirit finally spoke and he knew that it was not his imagination. The spirit called Grandfather's name and beckoned h im to follow. As Grandfather stood, he was suddenly transported to another world. Again, he thought that he was dreaming, but his flesh could feel the reality of this place; his senses knew that this was a state of abject reality, but in another time and place. The spirit warrior spoke to Grandfather. \"These are the things yet to come that will mark the destruction of man. These things you may never see, but you must work to stop them and pass these warnings on to your grandchildren. They are the possible futures of what will come if man does not come back to the Earth and begin to obey the laws of Creation and the Creator. There are four signs, four warnings, that only the children of the Earth will understand. Each warning marks the beginning of a possib le future, and as each warning becomes reality, so too does the future it marks\"..."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 202 The First Sign ...\"Welcome to what will be called the 'land of starvation'. The world will one day look upon all of this with horror and will blame the famine on the weather and the Earth. This will be the first warning to the world that man cannot live beyond the laws of Creation, nor can he fight Nature... There will come starvation before and after this starvation, but none will capture the attention of the world with su ch impact as does this one. The children of the Earth will know the lessons that are held in all of this pain and death, but the world will only see it as drought and famine, blaming Nature instead of itself\"... In his dream, the spirit spoke to Grandfath er. \"It is during the years of the famine, the first sign, that man will be plagued by a disease, a disease that will sweep the land and terrorize the masses. The white coats [doctors/scientists] will have no answers for the people, and a great cry will ar ise across the land. The disease will be born of monkeys, drugs and sex. It will destroy man from inside, making common sickness a killing disease. Mankind will bring this disease upon himself as a result of his life, his worship of sex and drugs, and a life away from Nature. This, too, is a part of the first warning; but, again, man will not heed this warning and he will continue to worship the false gods of sex and the unconscious spirit of drugs.\" The Second Sign The spirit looked at Grandfather for a long moment, then finally spoke. \"Holes in the sky... will become the second sign of the destruction of man. The holes in the sky and all that you have seen could become man's reality. It is here, at the beginning of this second sign, that man can no longer heal the Earth with physical action. It is here that man must heed the warning and work harder to change the future at hand. But man must not only work physically, he must also work spiritually, through prayer, for only through prayer can man now hope to heal the Earth and himself... \"These holes are a direct result of man's life, his travel, and of the sins of his grandfathers and grandmothers. These holes, the second sign, will mark the killing of his grandchildren and will become a legacy to man's life away from Nature. It is the time of these holes that will mark a great transition in mankind's thinking. They will then be faced with a choice -a choice to continue following the path of destruction, or a choice to move back to the philosophy of the Ea rth and a simpler existence. It is here that the decision must be made, or all will be lost..."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 203 The Third Sign Grandfather spent the next four days at the cave entrance, though for those four days nothing spoke to him, not even the Earth. He said that it was a time of great sorrow, of aloneness, and a time to digest all that had taken place. He knew that these things would not appear in his lifetime, but they had to be passed down to the people of the future with the same urgency and power with which t hey had been delivered to him. But he did not know how he would explain these unlikely events to anyone. Surely the elders and shamans of the tribes would understand, but not society, and certainly not anyone who was removed from the Earth and Spirit. He sat for the full four days, unmoving, as if made of stone, and his heart felt heavy with the burden he now carried. It was at the end of the fourth day that the third Vision came to him. As he gazed out onto the landscape towards the setting Sun, the sky suddenly turned to a liquid and then turned blood -red. As far as his eyes could see, the sky was solid red, with no variation in shadow, texture or light. The whole of Creation seemed to have grown still, as if awaiting some unseen command. Time, place and destiny seemed to be in limbo, stilled by the bleeding sky. He gazed for a long time at the sky, in a state of a we and terror, for the red colo r of the sky was like nothing he had ever seen in any sunset or sunrise. The color was that of man, not of Natur e, and it had a vile stench and texture. It seemed to burn the Earth wherever it touched. As sunset drifted to night, the s tars shone bright red, the colo r never leaving the sky, and everywhere the cries of fear and pain were heard. Again, the warrior spi rit appeared to Grandfather, but this time as a voice from the sky. Like thunder, the voice shook the landscape. \"This, then, is the third sign, the night of the bleeding stars. It will become known throughout the world, for the sky in all lands will be re d with the blood of the sky, day and night. It is then, with this sign of the third probable future, that there is no longer hope. Life on the Earth as man has lived it will come to an end, and there can be no turning back, physically or spiritually. It is then, if things are not changed during the second sign, that man will surely know the destruction of the Earth is at hand. It is then that the children of the Earth must run to the wild places and hide. For when the sky bleeds fire, there will be no safet y in the world of man.\""},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 204 Grandfather sat in shocked horror as the voice continued. \"From this time, when the stars bleed, to the fourth and final sign, will be four seasons of peace [that is, one year]. It is in these four seasons that the children of the E arth must live deep in the wild places and find a new home, close to the Earth and the Creator. It is only the children of the Earth that will survive, and they must live the philosophy of the Earth, never returning to the thinking of man. And survival will not be enough, for the children of the Earth must also live close to the Spirit. So tell them not to hesitate if and when this third sign becomes manifest in the stars, for there are but four seasons to escape\" ... Grandfather said that the voice and red sk y lingered for a week, and then were gone as quickly as they were manifest. The Fourth Sign He did not remember how many days he'd spent at the mouth of the cave, nor did it make a difference, for he had received the Vision he had come for. It was in hi s final night at the Eternal Cave that the fourth Vision came to Grandfather, this time carried by the voice of a young child. The child said, \"The fourth and final sign will appear through the next ten winters [that is, ten years] following the night that the stars will bleed. During this time, the Earth will heal itself and man will die. For those ten years, the children of the Earth must remain hidden in the wild places, make no permanent camps, and wander to avoid contact with the last remaining forces of man. They must remain hidden, like the ancient scouts, and fight the urge to go back to the destruction of man. Curiosity could kill many.\" There was a long silence, until Grandfather spoke to the child spirit, asking, \"And what will happen to the wor lds of man?\" There was another period of silence until finally the child spoke again. \"There will be a great famine throughout the world, like man cannot imagine. Waters will run vile, the poisons of man's sins running strong in the waters of the soils, lakes and rivers. Crops will fail, the animals of man will die, and disease will kill the masses. The grandchildren will feed upon the remains of the dead, and all about will be the cries of pain and anguish. Roving bands of men will hunt and kill other men for food, and water will always be scarce, getting scarcer with each passing year. The land, the water, the sky will all be poisoned, and man will live in the wrath of the Creator. Man will hide at first in the cities, but there he will die. A few will run to the wilderness, but the wilderness will destroy them, for they had long ago been given a choice. Man will be destroyed, his cities in ruin, and it is then that the grandchildren will pay for the sins of their grandfathers and grandmothers.\" \"Is th ere then no hope?\" Grandfather asked. The child spoke again. \"There is only hope during the time of the first and second signs. Upon the third sign, the night of the bleeding, there is no longer hope, for only the children of the Earth will survive. Man w ill be given these warnings; if unheeded, there can be no hope, for only the children of the Earth will purge themselves of the cancers of mankind, of mankind's destructive thinking. It will be the children of the Earth who will bring a new hope to the new society, living closer to the Earth and Spirit.\""},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 205 Then all was silent, the landscape cleared and returned to normal, and Grandfather stepped from the Vision. Shaken, he said that he had wandered for the next season, trying to understand all that had be en given to him, trying to understand why he had been chosen. Grandfather had related the story to me in great detail during that night of the four prophecies. I don't think that any event had been left out, and his emotions and thoughts were such that he actually relived it for us. Thus the power of his Vision became part of our spirit, our driving force, and a big part of our fears. 9 The prophetic accuracy of Stalking Wolf's visions are quite stunningly clear thus far, both in their highly detailed desc riptions and sequence of events, as presented to the young Tom Brown and friends. Here is the prophesied timeline as interpreted in the context of the ongoing magnetic polar reversal: 1 st Sign: 1975– 1985 African famine and AIDS pandemic spread 2 nd Sign: 1985– 1995 Holes form in Earth's ozone layer, permitting destructive solar rays 3 rd Sign: Dec 22, 2012 Magnetic reversal ignites a plasma canopy seen as red skies worldwide 4 th Sign: 2013– 2023 Large -scale destruction of low -reson ance human technology ensues Apache Grandfather Stalking Wolf experienced visions of the dramatic changes that have since occurred, and are yet to come, providing us with the culminating event marking the emergence of a new solar era. However, there are m ultitudes of more subtle signs of these oncoming electromagnetic changes that can be understood only in this context. The effects of shifting gravity and enhanced electromagnetic fields have been documented all over world, especially in areas where we find pyramids, or megalithic structures. These electromagnetic fields are focused by the axis- symmetric geometries of the pyramids of Giza, Egypt, thereby redistributing solar energy into a fixed glob al pattern of infrasound standing waves. These patterns of infrasound resonance have even been observed by satellite during the last solar maximum, on the night of December 7 -8, 2001, in the infrared spectrum (above). 10 "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 206 Deeply resonant humming heard in these infrasound hotspots is continually generating millions of reports of disturbance and annoyance worldwide, with new telephone hotlines even fielding calls from concerned residents to quell the panic. Deep infrasound booms like heartbeats have been reported all over the world by residents of Llanidloes, Mawnan, Bridlington, Auckland, Sydney, Klai, Ranchlands, and in the US in Anderson, 11 Kimberley, 12 Richmond, 13 Wilmington, 14 Knoxville, 15 Mobile, 16 Knob Noster, 17 Denver, 18 Seattle, 19 Arroyo Grande 20 and Atwater. 21 Infrasound resonance focal points in the US are mapped below. What is initially perceived as an annoyance quickly becomes a clear and present danger, as the infrasound resonance starts to overload all metals and wires with electricity until the extreme heat ignites fires. As Stalking Wolf emphasizes, “when the sky bleeds fire, there will be no safety in the world of man.” All of the modern electrical technologies of humanity will not only cease to fu nction, but will endanger human beings by spontaneous combustion. The surprising ignition of plastic- sheathed copper wiring was first noted in 1859 when a massive solar eject ion shorted out and then ignited telegraph lines across the entire United States and all of Europe, and auroras were seen as far south as Rome and Hawai’i. 22 Periods of elevated infrasound resonance have generated hundreds of fires in homes across the w orld. These resonant fires are located in the nodes of an infrasound standing wave pattern that is increasing in intensity, eventually requiring total evacuation of residents from areas like Tenerife, 23 Babura, 24 Lalapansi, 25 Mapuve, 26 Bodibe, 27 Landovica, 28 Pes chici, 29 Berici, 30 Messina, 31 northern Greece, 32 Kishtwar, 33 Ratria, 34 Santo Tomas, 35 and in the US in Seattle, 36 Colorado Springs, 37 San Mateo 38 and Santa Barbara. 39 A grave danger to personal safety in these regions of infrasound resonance will be posed by cellphones, which will ignite spontaneously in the pockets of clothing, as discovered already by one unfortunate man in Vallejo, California. 40 Such surprising events will be an inevitable occurrence in the years to come. One of the most interesting incidents of th is kind recently occurred in Soesterberg, Netherlands where, on the morning of July 19, 2009, ball lightning descended on the town in an unprecedented series of events. 41 Residents reported fast -moving ball lightning in more than 100 homes that sustained ex tensive damage to electrical systems. One eyewitness described a purple beam of light that shot skyward through the roof of one home. The fact that nobody was injured in Soesterberg is remarkable."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 207 Clearly, modern civilization’s embrace of electrical wiring is becoming a dangerous trap in many parts of the world, eventually threatening to kill anyone who cannot return to a life close to spirit and in the natural places of the Earth. Even high above the planet, infrasound drumming has been reported on multiple occasions onboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 – the result of an infrasound resonance of standing waves that will inevitably destroy the station’s systems as it has in many homes far below: The two men aboard the international spa ce station heard a strange metallic sound again Friday, four months after being startled by it the first time... Cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri was talking to flight controllers in Moscow when he heard a loud drum -like noise coming from the instrument panel of t he station's Russian -built living quarters. Kaleri and astronaut Michael Foale first heard the mystery noise - described as a flapping sheet of metal - back in late November. Neither the crewmen nor flight controllers were ever able to identify the sound... \"It's very strange,\" Russian Mission Control said. \"I doubt that it would be a coincidence that you're hearing the same thing coming from the same place.\" During a spacewalk in February, Kaleri and Foale were supposed to check the exterior of the space s tation where the noise originated last November. But Kaleri's spacesuit overheated and became damp, and the spacewalk had to be cut short, so the men did not have time to inspect the area. 42 The fact that Kaleri's investigative spacewalk was not possible a s his spacesuit overheated is another result of the electrical effects of the standing wave resonance. While the event has been passed off as the result of 'space junk', NASA directed a spacewalk mission that abruptly failed, yet no link has been drawn bet ween the anomalous acoustic energy heard with the anomalous heating of the astronaut's spacesuit. The infrasound energy that is likely causing the noisy drumming and the overheating of the cosmonaut's spacesuit will likely recur for a longer duration, buil ding an electrical charge capable of rendering the syste ms of the International Space Station inoperable."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 208 Hopi Elder White Feather relates a sacred prophecy describing the nine signs preceding the emergence of the new solar age on Earth – known to the H opi as The Fifth World.

It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the cere monies of my people will cease. \"These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock to and fro.

Then there will be much to rebuild. And soon - very soon afterward - Pahana will return. He shall bring with him t he dawn of the Fifth World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their hearts. Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall smooth the way to the Emergence into the Fifth World.\""},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 209 The Hopi prophecy details the order of events to occur, which can b e deciphered when combined with the Mayan calendar wisdom which links the Red Dawn prophecy with the end date of 12.22.2012. Thus, the ISS may be interpreted as the sign of the Blue Star Katchina that precedes the 2012 event, like an alarm clock heralding its imminence. The Hopi tell that soon after the fall of the space station will come the appearance of the Red Star Katchina bringing the Day of Purification, when the skies in all lands of the Earth will bleed red. Hopi Elders describe this future cosm ic event in simple and clear terms: “a small Red Star which will come very close and sit in our heavens watching us.” Now, just wait a minute... stars are not known to wander around and sneak up on anyone! What exactly is being suggested by the Hopi? While i t may come as a startling surprise for many, the Hopi description accurately reflects the scenario presented by the Binary Research Institute. 43 Astro - physics is now coming to grips with the reality that our solar system is a binary star system - that we wi ll imminently discover a dark star companion in close proximity to our sun. The binary model is the only one that predicts the extremely elliptical orbit of Sedna (inset diagram at left) , which must be highly influenced by our sun’s dark twin to maintain such an orbit. 44 The Hopi sacred prophecies tell of the impending incandescence of a red star in the close vicinity of Earth, describing it as a r evelation of the solar twins. The now hidden brown dwarf companion star will soon reach a critical proximity to the sun – its dormant surface will reignite, transforming it into a brilliant red star. The small size and dark brown color of the long -ago extinguished dark twin sun has allowed it to creep on its elliptical path back into close proximity of the solar system without our awareness, and its ignition will likely be triggered by the imminent wave front from the supernova of Betelgeuse. The red light of purification will emanate from this newly visible star, dramatically changing the color of our skies to a flaming red. This is referred to in the ancient wisdom as the Red Dawn of the forever cycle, where the consciousness and DNA of every living being will be transformed through the influence of the red light. Dr. Robert Ghostwolf and the Hopi Elders retell sacred traditional prophecies of the coming of the new world as an opportunity for the advancement of consciousness: The return of the Blue Star K atchina who is also known as Nan ga sohu will be the alarm clock that tells us of the new day and new way of life, a new world that is coming. This is where the changes will begin. They will start as fires that burn within us, and we will burn up with desi res and conflict if we do not remember the original teachings, and return to the peaceful way of life. Not far behind the twins will come the Purifier, the Red Katchina, who will bring the Day of Purification. On this day the Earth, her creatures and all life as we know it will change forever. There will be messengers that will precede this coming of the Purifier. They will leave messages to those on Earth who remember the old ways. The messages will be found written in the living stone, through the sacre d grains, and even the waters (Crop Circles have been found in ice). From the Purifier will issue forth a great Red Light. All things will change in their manner of being. Every living thing will be offered the opportunity to change from the largest to the smallest thing. "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 210 Those who return to the ways given to us in the original teachings, and live a natural way of life will not be touched by the coming of the Purifier. They will survive and build the new world. Only in the ancient teachings will the abilit y to understand the messages be found. It is important to understand that these messages will be found upon every living thing, even within our bodies, even within a drop of our blood. All life forms will receive the messages from the twins... those that fly, the plants, even the rabbit. The appearance of the twins begins a period of seven years and will be our final opportunity to change our ways. Everything we experience is all a matter of choice... When the Purifier comes we will see him first as a sma ll Red Star which will come very close and sit in our heavens watching us. Watching us to see how well we have remembered the sacred teachings. This Purifier will show us many miraculous signs in our heavens. In this way we will know Creator is not a dream . Even those who do not feel their connection to spirit will see the face of creator across the sky. Things unseen will be felt very strongly. Many things will begin to occur that will not make sense, for reality will be shifting back in and out of the dream state. There will be many doorways to the lower world that will open at this time. Things long forgotten will come back to remind us of our past creations. All living things will want to be present for this day when time ends, and we enter the forever cycle of the Fifth World. We will receive many warnings allowing us to change our ways from below the Earth as well as above. Then, one morning in a moment, we will awaken to the Red Dawn. The sky will be the color of blood, many things will then begin to happen that right now we are not sure of their exact nature. For much of reality will not be as it is now. 45 Hopi culture foretells invisible acoustic changes in the environment and in the hearts of human beings, as “things unseen will be strongly felt .” The Elders inform us “the messages will be found written in the living stone, through the sacred grains, and even the waters (Crop Circles have been found in ice).” For decades now, conscious plasma orbs have been forming geometric messages in ice and g rain fields, providing coherent mathematical formulas. The most complex quadratic functions were rendered in England, where the Mandelbrot Set [ z n+1 = z n 2 + c ] appeared in Ickleton in 1991. 46 Subsequent agro - glyphs formed at Lurkley Hill in 2006 47 and Wayland Smithy in 2008 48 presented a variation on the fractal formula: [ z n+1 = z n 2 ].

The agroglyphs provide us with a map of the nodal points of infrasound standing wave patterns now being stimulated by increasing solar activity.

Russian researchers have used infrasound and light waves to induce DNA transmutation, by which one species is genetically t ransmuted into another. 51 This discovery provides a new framewo rk for quantum leaps in evolution, whereby quantum shifts from high to low levels of planetary infrasound resonance regulate the expression of DNA in Earth’s many lifeforms. New animal species are being encountered that are a sign of planet -wide genet ic transmutations now occurring in hotspots of infrasound humming. An unusual new species now recorded often is a mostly hairless variety of purple/grey- skinned canine dubbed the ‘hyote’ (hyena/coyote, juvenile seen alive in captivity above), photographed and videotaped in Minnesota , 52 Maryland , Texas and Saudi Arabia . Sightings of various giant species of ‘thunderbirds’ have also been increasing around the world as species exhibit spontaneous DNA changes. Another example of a new species now emerging at hotspo ts throughout the world is a kind of gracile fox that displays a long neck and large ears, with a tan coat that can be subtly spotted on the backside. The animal’s fine facial features, combined with the extremely elongated limbs and tail, give it a deer -l ike appearance. This ‘deerfox’ has been photographed and observed in the US in England (pregnant female and two juveniles seen in separate photographs, above). 53 These same infrasound -related DNA changes are expressed in extraordinary human beings who pos sess profound cosmic knowledge of their pristine origins and the unlimited holographic capabilities enabled by such knowledge. A shining example of this truth is a young woman from the taiga forests of Siberia named Anastasia who has mastered ayurveda – the art of living. Having inherited the deepest of cosmic wisdom from her Vedruss forefathers, Anastasia provides us with the spiritual information that will germinate the seeds of human divinity now being planted in the fields of the Earth. The voices of the indigenous Elders of the world speak as one, revealing ancient Vedic knowledge of the transdimensional nature of human consciousness to guide our path of ascent into the red light of Oneness."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 216 The Sanskrit wisdom traditions of Russia have recently revealed a profound knowledge of nature that forms the basis for the use of heartbeat resonance in monumental psychoacoustics. Timeless Vedic wisdom understands the seed as physician and the tree as an organic antenna - a collector of cosmic energy for the single purpose of powering the human heart and spirit. The Vedruss Elders of Siberia reveal their process of DNA imprinting of seeds for the creation of a resonant field of heartbeat synchronization. 54 By h eartbeat entrainment through seed imprinting, the family of Anastasia has created a resonant field of infrasound that amplifies their heartbeat to enable astral travel through the Akashic field of planetary infrasound standing waves on the heartbeat frequency of love : “When someone is in a state of love they emit a radiant energy. It takes but a split second for it to reflect off the planets floating overhead and come back to Earth to give li fe to everything that breathes... The Sun is one of those pla nets, and it reflects but a tiny fraction of such radiance. Only bright rays can travel into Space from Man on the Earth. And only beneficial rays can be reflected from Space back to Earth.\" \"Under the influence of malicious feelings Man can emit only dar k rays. These dark rays cannot rise but must fall into the depths of the Earth. Bouncing off its core, they return to the surface in the form of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, wars, etc. The culminating achievement of these dark rays is their direct effe ct on the Man originating them, invariably exacerbating the man's own malicious feelings.\" 55 Vedruss knowledge echoes the call of the Hopi Elders, who foretell of the great increase in the energies moving through human beings, whose inner emotional states will become amplified in the light of the Red Purifier to manifest as fires that will burn within us. Malevolent feelings will consume those who harbor them, while the rays of love will also become equally amplified to generate healing forces in human beings who harbor a deep Creational love by living as one being in heartbeat resonance . Hopi Elders also foretell of portals to the lower worlds that will be opening at this time to remind us of our past creations. Referred to as ‘sipapu’ , these lower re alms are described in Hopi wisdom traditions as having been used to preserve the human race during previous cataclysmic events on Earth. Yaqui Elder Don Juan elaborated on the secret knowledge possessed by ancient Nahuatl seers pertaining to the motive pro perties of fire and water for bodily transport to fourth -density realms of inorganic life, in artificially generated HHO plasma chambers both above and below the Earth’s surface: He continued then with his elucidation of the practices of the old seers. An other of their great findings had to do with the category of secret knowledge: fire and water. They discovered that flames have the most peculiar quality; they can transport man bodily, just as water does... They considered flames and fluidity to be higher , magical properties, and they used them as a means for bodily transportation to the realm of inorganic life. 56 Don Juan said that the old seers observed that the wetness of water only dampens or soaks, but the fluidity of water moves. It runs, they surmis ed, in search of other levels underneath us. They believed that water had been given to us not only for life, but also as a link, a road to the other levels below... to be transported bodily by the fluidity of water anywhere between this level of ours and the other seven levels below. 57 The knowledge of the below had to do with fog, water of underground springs, swamps, lightening bolts, earthquakes, the night, moonlight and the moon. 58 “[Some men of knowledge] endeavored to use seeing positively and to tea ch it to their fellow men. I’m con - vinced that under their direction, the populations of entire cities went into other worlds and never came back.” 59 "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 217 “The old seers saw that the Earth has a cocoon,” he went on. “They saw that there was a ball encasing the Earth, a luminous cocoon that entraps the Eagle’s emanations. The Earth is a gigantic sentient being subjected to the same forces we are.” 60 ”[Don Juan stated that]... one of the most worthwhile findings of the ancient seers... was the discovery that organic life is not the only form of life present on this E arth... For seers, to be alive means to be aware... For the average man, to be aware means to be an organism. This is where seers are different. For them, to be aware means that the emanations that caus e awareness are encased inside a receptacle. 61 The circular aspect... is what maintains life and awareness, fulfillment and purpose... “The reason that it’s called the circular force is that it comes in rings, thread -like hoops of iridescence... it strikes all living beings ceaselessly... to give them strength, direction, awareness; to give them life... It’s one indivisible force that fits all living beings, organic and inorganic.” 62 “They say that perception is a condition of alignment... Alignment is wh at allows awareness to be cultivated by every living creature...” When seers see perception, they witness that the luminosity of the... emanations outside those creatures’ cocoons brightens the luminosity inside their cocoons. The outside luminosity attrac ts the inside one; it traps it, so to speak, and fixes it. That fixation is the awa reness of every specific being. 63 He explained that what he called the key to everything was the first -hand knowledge that the E arth is a sentient being and as such can give warriors a tremendous boost; it is an impulse that c omes from the awareness of the Earth itself at the instant in which the emanations inside the warriors’ cocoons are aligned with the appropriate emanations inside the Earth’s cocoon. Since both the Ea rth and man are sentient beings, their emana tions coincide, or rather, the E arth has all the emanations that are present in man and all the emanations present in all sentient beings, organic or inorganic for that matter. When a moment of alignment takes place, sentient beings use that alignment in a limited way and perceive their world. Warriors can use that alignment either to perceive, like everyone else, or as a boost that allows them to enter unimaginable worlds. 64 He explained that the E arth’s boost is the force of alignment of only the amber emanations. It is a boost that heightens awareness to unthinkable degrees. To the new seers it is a blast of unlimited consciousness, which they call total freedom. 65 Don Juan restated over and over that the portio n of the emanations inside man’s cocoon is in there only for awareness, and that awareness is matching that portion of the emanations with the same portion of emanations at large. They are called emanations at large because they are immense... inside man’s cocoon the unknown is the emanations untouched by awareness. When the glow of awareness touches them, they become active and can be aligned with the corresponding emanations at large. Once that happens the unknown is perceived and becomes the known. 66 The Eagle, that power that governs the destiny of all living things, reflects equally and at once all those living things... [and] although it is not moved by the circumstances of any living thing, has granted a gift to each of those beings. In its own way and right, any one of them, it if so desires, has the power to keep the flame of awareness, the power to disobey the summons to die and be consumed. Every living thing has been granted the powe r, if it so desires, to seek an opening to freedom and to go throug h it. It is evident to the seer who sees the opening, and to the creatures that go through it, that the Eagle has granted that gift in order to perpetuate awareness."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 218 For the purpose of guiding living beings to that opening, the Eagle created the Nagual. T he Nagual is a double being to whom the rule has been revealed. Whether it be in the form of a human being, an animal, a plant, or anything else that lives, the Nagual by virtue of its doubleness is drawn to seek that hidden passageway. The Nagual comes in pairs, male and female. A double man and a double woman become the Nagual only after the rule has been told to each of them, and each of them has understood it and accepted it in full ... To the eye of the seer, a Nagual man or a Nagual woman appears as a luminous egg with four compartments. Unlike the average human being, who has two sides only, a left and a right, the Nagual has the left side divided into two long sections, and a right side equally divided in two. The Eagle created the first Nagual m an and first Nagual woman as seers and immediately put them in the world to see. It provided them with four female warriors who were stalkers, three male warriors, and one male courier, whom they were to nourish, enhance and lead to freedom... In order to ma ke sure that the first Nagual man would lead his party to freedom and not deviate from that path or become corrupted, the Eagle took the Nagual woman to the other world to serve as a beacon, guiding the party to the opening. The Nagual and his warriors we re then commanded to forget. They were plunged into darkness and were given new tasks: the task of remembering themselves, and the task of remembering the Eagle ... The command to forget was so great that everyone was separated. They did not remember who they were. The Eagle intended that if they were capable of remembering themselves again, they would find the totality of themselves. Only then would they have the strength and forbearance necessary to seek and face their definitive journey. Their last task, a fter they had regained the totality of themselves, was to get a new pair of double beings and transform them into a new Nagual man and a new Nagual woman by virtue of revealing the rule to them... Don Juan explained that the rule was not a tale, and that to cross over to freedom did not mean eternal life as eternity is commonly understood –that is, as living forever. What the rule stated was that one could keep the awareness which is ordinarily relinquished at the moment of dying... [A]t the moment of crossing , one enters into the third attention, and the body in its entirety is kindled with knowledge. Every cell at once becomes aware of itself, and also aware of the totality of the body... Therefore the crux of the warrior’s struggle was not so much to realize t hat the crossing over stated in the rule meant crossing to the third attention, but rather to conceive that there exists such an awareness at all. 67 "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 219 “Seers say that there are three types of attention... they are rather three levels of attainment. They are the first, second, and third attention, each of them an independent domain, complete in itself.” He explained that the first attention in man is the animal awareness... everything that one can think about is part of the first attention... 68 Don Juan expl ained that in order for our first attention to bring into focus the world that we perceive, it has to emphasize certain emanations selected from the narrow band of emanations where man’s awareness is located. The discarded emanations are still within our reach but remain dormant, unknown to us for the duration of our lives. The new seers call the emphasized emanations the right side, normal awareness, the tonal, this world, the known, the first attention. The average man calls it reality, rationality, common sense. The emphasized emanations compose a large portion of man’s band of awareness, but a very small piece of the total spectrum of emanations present inside the cocoon of man. The disregarded emanations within man’s band are thought of as a sort of pr eamble to the unknown, the unknown proper consisting of the bulk of emanations which are not part of the human band and which are never emphasized. Seers call them the left -side awareness, the nagual, the other world, the unknown, the second attention. 69 “[To be able]... to utilize those unused emanations, one needs uncommon, elaborate tactics that require supreme discipline and concentration... the art of dreaming ... the concentration needed to be aware that one is having a dream is the forerunner of the second attention. That concentration is a form of consciousness that is not in the same category as the consciousness needed to deal with the daily world. “The new seers... let the mastery of awareness develop to its natural end, which is to extend the glow of awareness beyond the bounds of the luminous cocoon in one single stroke. The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the fire from within: a glow that kindles not one band at a time but all the... em anations inside man’s cocoon .” Don Juan expressed his awe for the new seers’ deliberate effort to attain the third attention while they are alive and conscious of their individuality ... “The supreme accomplishment of human beings,” he said, “is to attain that level of attention while retaining the life -force, without becoming a disembodied awareness moving like a flicker of light...” 70 [He then explained that]...the glow produced by a state of total awareness... is seen as a burst of incandescence in the entire luminous egg. It is a n explosion of light of such a magnitude that the boundaries of the shell are diffused and the inside emanations extend themselves beyond anything imaginable. “Are those special cases, don Juan?” “Certainly. They happen only to seers. No other living me n or any other living creatures brighten up like that. Seers who deliberately attain total awareness are a sight to behold. That is the moment when they burn from within. The fire from within consumes them. And in full awareness they fuse themselves to the emanations at large, and glide into eternity. [As seers] our case is a bit different, because we are at the end of our trail. We are not seeking anything... we go from day to day doing nothing. We are waiting. I will not tire of repeating this: we know that we are waiting and we know what we are waiting for. We are waiting for freedom!” 71 "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 220 A Great Cycle of approximately 309,888 years (12 x 12 Precession cycles of 2,152 years) nears completion with the returning Dark Star on its near 36,650 year elliptical cycle (2,152 x 17 = 36,584), as red supergiant Betelgeuse shrinks in collapse, poised to illuminate all that is hidden within the shadows of the human heart and our entire solar system.
