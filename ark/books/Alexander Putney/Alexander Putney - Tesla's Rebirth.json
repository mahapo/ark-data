A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. 2 Exactly what does Dr. Tesla mean? What imperceptible force so directs consciousness? Infrasound. Focused low-frequency sound cancels the force of gravity, 3 known to the ancients as the syllable ‘Om’. Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a thoughtful scientist who did not rely on belief, but on his knowledge of universal laws. His dialogs with Swami Vivekananda provided a Sanskrit cosmological framework that merged seamlessly with his pragmatic scientific understandings of the electrical nature of the soul and the universe – simultaneously the perceiver and the perceived. Tesla describes the matter/energy relationship in Sanskrit terms in an article, posthumous published, entitled ‘Man's Greatest Achievement’: Long ago... [mankind] recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasha or luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life giving Prana or creative force, calling into existence, in never ending cycles all things and phenomena. The primary substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious velocity, becomes gross matter; the force subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears, reverting to the primary substance. 4 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 3 According to Swami Nikhilananda, “Nikola Tesla, the great scientist who specialized in the field of electricity, was much impressed to hear from the Swami his explanation of the Samkhya cosmogony and the theory of cycles given by the Hindus. He was particularly struck by the resemblance between the Samkhya theory of matter and energy and that of modern physics.” 5 Swami Vivekananda himself remarked on his meetings with Tesla, in a letter to a friend dated February 13th, 1896: ...Mr. Tesla was charmed to hear about the Vedantic Prana and Akasha and the Kalpas, which according to him are the only theories modern science can entertain... Mr. Tesla thinks he can demonstrate math- ematically that force and matter are reducible to potential energy. I am to go see him next week to get this mathematical demonstration. 6 How was Tesla applying the principles of the Vedanta to achieve his results? His extensive use of copper to conduct electricity is highly reminiscent of ayurvedic techniques of water cleansing still used today in Tibet, Nepal and India. Copper vessels are used to store water in sacred places, thereby accumulating energy by resonant coupling to pulsating stone altars and temples. Very simply made ayurvedic well water systems include resonant stone construction and a submerged copper tube filled with resonant oils that transfer high vibratory characteristics through the copper to the water. These advanced energetic water systems create a completely antibacterial environment, 7 achieving natural results far beyond the capability of industrial chemical water treatment. Resonant Sanskrit technologies are sophisticated examples of wireless power transmission and storage . This scientific concept was announced to the scientific world in Nikola Tesla’s 1904 paper, ‘The Transmission of Electrical Energy Without Wires.’ 8 In June of 2007 MIT scientists announced research funded by the Army Research Office, claiming Tesla’s century-old discovery as their own, cleverly named ‘wi-tricity.’ 9 Continuing the obfuscation of knowledge by hiding the theft of Tesla’s inventions, the military and mass media feeds out the falsehood that “WiTricity is rooted in such well-known laws of physics that it makes one wonder why no one thought of it before.” The absurdness of this disinformation is revealed by any search engine result for ‘tesla coil’ – the copper wireless power device is so simple that many people have been reproducing Tesla Coils for decades now, yet commercialization was vehemently blocked. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 4 The contradictory safety information on ‘non-radiative’ magnetic fields presented by MIT is another obvious discrepancy that should be questioned. The MIT graduates tell us the microwave transmitters “interact so weakly with biological systems” that they are safe to be in each and every room of the house. Are we to believe that prolonged exposure to weak radiation is perfectly safe, not carcinogenic? If radiation is unsafe, does that mean a ‘non-radiative field’ is safe? In fact, it is the frequency that determines safety, not the type of field – high-frequency microwave oscillations disrupt living systems while low frequencies enhance vitality. As early as 1994, researchers Lai and Singh reported that high- frequency emitters cause cancer by breaking apart DNA, with prolonged exposure causing death. 10 In a leaked memo Motorola executive Norm Sandler assures that the lethal microwaves of Motorola products will not hinder sales, stating confidently: \"we have sufficiently war-gamed the Lai-Singh issue.\" 11 Motorola executives used CIA terminology to identify customers as adversaries in a game of slow death? Wi -tricity is neither new nor safe to use. Microwave-heated water significantly increases aging by destroying the DNA of plants and animals alike, while microwave-heated blood kills transfusion patients. Used in medical devices, web/phone networks or ovens, microwave systems slowly and invisibly kill their users, having already sent cancer rates soaring to become the second leading cause of death in the US (after heart disease, the #1 media-driven cause of death). Conversely, ayurvedic pyramids are resonant networks that enhance health and consciousness by amplifying natural long-waves, as implicated in the astonishing claims of Tesla’s later years regarding the viability of electrical atmospheric stimulation. From his conception of infrasound standing waves Nikola envisioned the higher quantum states of the resonating atmospheric medium, eventually leading him to the hypothesis that nighttime could be eliminated on our planet by the generation of a glowing plasma canopy shielding Earth from harmful solar radiation. Might this process be related to today’s ‘noctilucent’ clouds? The converging predictions of Nikola Tesla and the Native American indigenous wisdom of the Apache, Hopi, Sioux, Maya and other ancient cultures exactly describe this scenario of red auroras enveloping the skies worldwide in the prophecy of the Red Dawn. This sacred Sanskrit and Mayan wisdom must be taken to heart, for the Mayan culture has accurately charted all major solar events from before their time until today! While there has been no suggestion that Tesla took up Sanskrit meditation or yogic practices, one of his meditative habits was recorded in portrait photographs of Tesla reading calmly amidst giant crackling arcs of lightening in his Colorado Springs laboratory. The rhythmic low-frequency oscillations of his inventions may have enhanced Tesla’s state of awareness by synchronizing thought-wave patterns. Sanskrit meditation techniques involving tri-frequency entrainment have been rediscovered and used by this author for inner searching that has recently lead to the question of reincarnation, an intriguing possibility that resurfaced when reading the material of trance medium Edgar Cayce. Several advanced teachings on reincarnation emphasize that successive incarnations of a particular spirit present strong similarities, both mental and physical. Plato wrote: “the soul returns to Earth in a body similar to its last one and has similar talents and inclinations.” I felt an intuitive connection to the work of Cayce, yet found no evidence of rebirth connection. Spiritual researcher and author David Wilcock presents a strong case for being the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce – demonstrating a remarkable likeness and life-path. 12 Looking at facial features with a new sensitivity, I opened my mind to any information that might help me unveil previous lives. My curiosity reflected an instinctive feeling that an explanation for the mysterious origin of my surging knowledge of quantum physics may involve a past life connection. I had grown up ignorant of advanced mathematics, enjoying only the visual geometry involved in calculations, yet there I was - an artist at age twenty-five, having stumbled upon the Unified Field Theory and intuitively applied it to a global map in a handful of months! What could possibly account for this sudden psychic reception? Perhaps everything that was becoming clear to me during this period of revelation in my life was the floodwater of stored memories, both traumatically harsh and ecstatically insightful, from an intense past life in science or math. I thought to browse old photographs from the early 1900s looking for an artist or scientist with a familiar face... Max Planck? A resemblance. Gustav Klimt? No... perhaps Nikola Tesla?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 6 A portrait of this author (above, left) is presented for comparison, photographed in 2005 in Mendocino, California. When I first saw the 1895 portrait of Nikola at 39 years old (above, right) I was transfixed by the familiarity of the confident, penetrating gaze of a ‘man out of time’. I pulled my eyes away from the century-old black- and -white photograph asking myself – am I the reincarnation of Nikola Tesla ? The resemblance between us is strong in virtually all of the skull structures, presenting an almost identical set of features below the brow. While our physical likeness is certainly remarkable, with an angular countenance and thin 6’ 3” build, our identical ayurvedic research angle into electro-acoustics perhaps presents the strongest parallel. The state of creative rapture Tesla achieved is one I have also learned to develop in years of art making and meditation; a solace from the confusion of the industrial world Tesla helped to manifest. When asked for his opinion on the theories of contemporary Albert Einstein, Tesla gave a scathing analysis of relativity theory, calling it a “magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king.\" 13 Tesla’s own theorem went unpublished, yet his inventions displayed a beautiful simplicity that reflected the natural order: “My explanations of natural phenomena are not so involved as his. They are simpler, and... will throw light on many puzzling phenomena of the cosmos.” 14 The profound cognitions that on occasion drove Nikola to the point of breakdown became the fuel for long hours of work in pursuit of a technological means for the advancement of world peace. 15 I have for years carried the burden of psychic awareness, and felt a strong obligation to humanity at seeing the state of needless suffering in our world – an obligation for which I could not account whatsoever until I read of the life of Nikola Tesla. When pouring over Nikola’s writings and patents I felt both elated and deeply comforted by their confirmation that ayurvedic technologies solve the problem of human suffering."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 7 Far more suggestive of karmic ties than mere physical resemblance is the continuance of Nikola Tesla’s research in my completion of his unpublished theorem of terrestrial infrasound standing waves. Perfectly describing the global resonance maps I rendered in 2003, Tesla explains their structure in 1913: The Earth is a conductor of electricity, and as such has its own electrical period of vibration... this is the interval the current requires in passing to, and returning from, the diametrically opposite point of the globe. Now, the wonderful fact is, that notwithstanding its immense size, the Earth responds to a great number of vibrations and can be resonantly excited just like a wire of limited dimensions. When this takes place there are formed on its surface stationary parallel circles of equal electrical activity , which can be revealed by properly attuned [infrasound] instruments. Imagine that a transmitter capable of exciting the Earth were placed at one of the Poles. Then the crests and hollows of the stationary waves would be in parallel circles with their planes at right angles to the axis of the Earth... The best plan would be to place three transmitters at properly chosen points on the globe so as to establish three non-interferable systems of stationary waves at right angles to one another. If this were done, innumerable results of the greatest practical value could be realized. 16 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 8 Mapping of the infrasound field stimulated by the Orion pyramids of Giza, Egypt reveals the resonant birthplace locations of both Tesla and myself. Nikola Tesla was born at the stroke of midnight 17 on July 9-10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia (encircled, p. 7). Smiljan (44.565°N 15.293°E) is a small town located precisely 1,327 miles from the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt, a distance that is 5.33% of the Earth’s mean circumference. This is a resonant distance reflecting the values of Fibonacci #353 /2 (2649... /2 = 1325...) and F#131 /2 (1066... /2 = 533...). 18 The unlimited energy available at these sacred intervals enhances consciousness, free will and awareness throughout the reincarnation process. Nikola Tesla’s very personal accounts detail a childhood fascination with nature 19 that I also enjoyed in early play among the resplendent Caribbean ocean life forms. An Aquarian water bearer, I was born Alexander Putney on February 11, 1978 in Christiansted, St. Croix, USVI (17.746°N 64.703°W). St. Croix is 5,956 miles from Giza, or 23.92%, approximating the doubled (x2) values of Fibonacci #136 and F#358. The synchronicity of the birthplaces of both Tesla and myself within the Fibonacci-ordered focal points of Magnetic Resonance reconfirms the significance of infrasound levels to the development of enhanced consciousness. I left my childhood in the Caribbean with a profound appreciation for water and nature, having had the opportunity to be enveloped by fast, shimmering clouds of tiny fishes evading diving sea birds. My first classroom experiences were shaped by the Maria Montessori teaching method that engages children in holistic, group-oriented learning. I held a great interest in visual geometry exercises, tracing and overlapping metal inset shapes onto paper –the circle, the square, and the triangle. In one instance I drew a map of the Americas from memory that was sufficiently detailed to surprise my teacher and parents; a drawing whose details I still hold fresh in my memory today. Many changes came with a move to the snow and ice of Toronto, Canada, where I attended a Montessori elementary school, as well as high school at the University of Toronto Schools. While this period was full of fun, sports and solid friendships, an odd dream cycle emerged that may be of significance. From the age of perhaps ten I recall frightening dreams of a floating object in front of me, consuming my attention by its complexity and movement. It was a jumbled Rubik’s-Cube-like puzzle of continually rearranging blocks. The object had a strangely discomforting size that was from one perspective immense and grotesque and then from another shift in perspective incomprehensibly small and invasive. My repulsion for the mesmerizing and repeating anxiety dream images seemed to stem from its overwhelming complexity and the speed of its change, like some unknown contagion. After about three years of occasionally recurring, this and other such fear dreams subsided with time and a change of residence. In retrospect, the anxiety associated with this puzzle may have had some relation to the geometry of resonance that lay embedded in my superconscious, to be accessed later by visualization and meditation on the teachings of Akasha, wherein one can find access to higher consciousness:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 9 holographic mind—a way of seeing all the possibilities at once in a flash of understanding... It is such a different way of understanding the world that most people cannot hold that understanding after they come out of it... like looking at a city map before folding it up again. You know that you saw it but you couldn’t say much about what it was that you saw and you couldn’t reproduce the map from memory. But having been shown it by someone telling you directions, you can believe that they do know how to direct you to get to your destination. 20 Tesla describes the origins of his inventive process of what is now called ‘remote viewing’ – a quintessential tool for inventors developed in flashes of light during his early youth in the 1860s: In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight of real objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures of things and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When a word was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great... anxiety... To free myself of these tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mind on something else I had seen, and in this way I would of ten obtain temporary relief; but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images. It was not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command; my \"reel\" had run out, as it were, because I had seen little of the world –only objects in my home and the immediate surroundings. As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time, in order to chase the appearances from my vision, the remedy gradually lost all its force. Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge, and I saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them, but by and by I succeeded in fixing them; they gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things. I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to travel –of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys –see new places, cities and countries– live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations. This I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radically opposite to the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much more expeditious and efficient. The moment one constructs a device to carry into practise a crude idea he finds himself unavoidably engrost with the details and defects of the apparatus. As he goes on improving and reconstructing, his force of concentration diminishes and he loses sight of the great underlying principle. Results may be obtained but always at the sacrifice of quality. My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as I conceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In twenty years there has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. The carrying out into practice of a crude idea as is being generally done is, I hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money and time. 21 The efficiency of holographic mental imaging shines throughout Tesla’s mechanical work. Over one hundred years after such dramatic technological advances, his wireless inventions themselves have been re-engineered for population control via brainwave confinement. So too has Tesla’s advanced mental imaging methodology been weaponized by the US military as ‘remote viewing’, long since taught in mystic circles as astral traveling; the projection of one’s awareness to any desired location to gather detailed information or witness events unfolding. The holographic use of mental imaging provides access to the unfailing memory of the superconscious in-dwelling spirit, by which we can recall past lives."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 10 To aid my meditations on reincarnation and time, I have extensively compared portraits of a youthful Tesla of 23 years (at left) with the death mask taken before his funeral in January of 1943, at the age of 86 (at right). One can strikingly see the effects of time on the human body, revealing the remarkable durability of our skin to the extreme environmental toxins of our era. Looking at these photographs of Nikola Tesla is, for me, like looking into a time-distorted mirror. In Nikola’s face I see that my own body is merely a reflection of my transcending spirit, and will continually regenerate for me on my path of learning until I finally transcend to become pure energy. In this way Creation allows us to know of our immortality and by spiritual effort recall our ascending path of learning through successive lives. It is a remarkable transpersonal experience that we have been offered by Creation, to pierce the veil of the cycles of time and the grand illusion of aging –an experience that perhaps first occurred for me on a subconscious level at Niagara Falls, Ontario. During my high school years in Toronto, Canada I had more than one opportunity to enjoy the rainbow mists of Niagara Falls and stand in wonder beside its plunging waters, before the bronzes were installed commemorating Tesla’s (voluntarily underpaid) work on the Niagara hydroelectric system. I had visited that site exactly 100 years after Tesla’s project, in 1993 and again in 1995 during my final year of high school. Seeking a creative path, I attended Boston University’s School of Fine Arts Sculpture program and gravitated immediately to welding steel. A deepening interest in understanding ancient artwork lead me to study eastern mysticism, especially Buddhism, and I graduated in 2000 with a Minor in Religion and a Major in Sculpture. My technical sense asserted itself during those years, in mastering various complex mould-making and fabrication techniques as well as in a fascination with analog sound, seeded long ago by exposure to the music and dance of the Caribbean. I had collected vinyl records for years,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 11 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 12 and recorded audio explorations with a mixer and turntables, and in 2000 I moved with friends to Berkeley, California where I set up a welding shop and continued manual sound melding. The following year I was privileged to be the live sound-mixer for digital filmmaking pioneer Rob Nilsson, recording for Attitude with shotgun boom microphone (above). This profile portrait of myself may serve for comparison with the profile portrait of Nikola Tesla reading, seated in front of his giant mandala-like spiral coil (facing page). The path toward conscious realization of my prior incarnation would open itself to me later that same year during journeys in the Atacama Desert. In 2001 I was awarded a Brandeis-Hayes traveling fellowship to Arica, Chile, where my introduction to the sacred sounds of the Andes occurred. On the shorelines once inhabited by the ancient Chinchorro seafarers, I discovered many bi-frequency whistles and acupressure instruments carved from resonant stones, and my deeply rooted fascination with electro-acoustics was instantly re-engaged in the analysis of ancient sounds and geometric symbols. My collection of ancient tuned whistles and acupressure tools garnered the attention of Austrian exhibition organizer Klaus Dona, and were included in his ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ exhibition of 2004 in Interlaken, Switzerland. The event was hosted by Erik Von Daniken’s Mystery Park, who accepted my proposal for the additionally production of a 7.5m (27’) giant human skeleton recreation for their permanent exhibit (pictured on the following page). The dimensions of this project required eight months of work in a bunkered airpl ane hanger just behind the Park loaned by the Swiss military, to make use of a 4m swing-arm hoist built for airplane maintenance. The preparatory work involved the selection of giant bones for exhibition from the collection of Padre Vaca, a retired medical doctor and amateur archeologist from Ecuador recently deceased. The two-week trip would initiate a stream of synchronous discoveries regarding the Sanskrit origin of the world’s pyramids and life-extending electrum water. Many answers came to me in full force in La Maná, Ecuador, after tasting the electrum ‘water of life’ that I would go on to use extensively in the following years of intensive meditation and research. Drinking the sacred electrum water in Cuenca, Ecuador, I was astounded to see hammered copper plates from the Crespi collection adorned with kundalini imagery –DNA electrification in conjunction with diagrams of pyramids and standing waves!"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 13 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 14 The Fibonacci angles of the Great Pyramid lead me to research the Fibonacci structure of standing waves, which had just that very year been first structurally defined by Cervenka et al., yet only along a single axis. I pursued the fully four-dimensional geometric problem with abandon, as these same patterns adorned all of the ancient sacred stonework and ceramics. Prominent examples of standing wave patterns are also evident in the North American Hopi culture, and they immediately stood out to me as the largest discovery that I had made up until that day –that indigenous cultures utilize focused infrasound standing waves ay sacred sites to enhance health and consciousness. Tesla’s Colorado Springs Notes recorded his observations made the night of July 3, 1899, that went unpublished until 35 years after his death. I was born in 1978 –the very year of the first publication of Nikola’s most significant discovery of terrestrial stationary waves. Tesla related his own personal feelings on the transcendence of the human spirit during his Edison Medal reception speech of May 18, 1917: I may say, also, that I am deeply religious at heart, although not in the orthodox meaning, and that I give myself to the constant enjoyment of believing that the greatest mysteries of our being are still to be fathomed and that, all the evidence of the senses and the teachings of exact and dry sciences to the contrary notwithstanding, death itself may not be the termination of the wonderful metamorphosis we witness. In this way I have managed to maintain an undisturbed peace of mind... 22 The 1899 photograph of Tesla’s hand (above, left) was the very first photograph taken by fluorescent light , 23 providing a wonderful opportunity for comparison with my own hand, photographed in 2007 (at right). While many similarities can be seen in the relative sizes and proportions of the fingers and thumbs, the fingertips somewhat differ in shape, as do the palms. I may have a slightly larger palm than Nikola had, perhaps in proportion to my greater height and weight. Nikola Tesla was 154 lbs., and “six feet two and one -quarter inches tall [or 185cm]. While his body was slender, it was built within normal proportions. His hands, however, and particularly his thumbs, seemed unusually long.” 24 I am slightly taller and heavier than Nikola, being 6’ 3 1 / 2 ” (or 189cm) tall, with a thinly-built frame of 169 lbs., dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and – thumbs that seem unusually long."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 15 Tesla’s discoveries have illuminated the world and caused many forms of pollution. I grew up on a small island witnessing powerful tropical thunderstorms, largely isolated from light pollution and urban smog, and have spent the majority of my adult life without a car, preferring to pedal a bicycle. Tesla invariably walked in Manhattan, once being hit by a taxicab in 1939 at the age of 83, receiving a hip injury for which he did not seek medical aid. In 2001, I myself sustained a hip injury in a car accident visiting Toronto, Canada, for which I did not seek medical aid. As Tesla, I maintain an ascetic lifestyle, abstaining from tobacco and enjoying a moderate diet, while I am not the vegetarian Tesla became in his later years. Nikola only drank water or milk, 25 and I myself drink only purified water with colloidal silver and gold, an ayurvedic choice made upon visiting an ancient sacred site in La Maná, Ecuador and testing its vitalizing electrum spring water in 2004. At one of the mountainside electrum water springs I enjoyed drinking from the source, as sunlight revealed minute flecks of gold sparkling in the sandy streambeds. The sacred Sanskrit site has a humming vitality and a purified water source that drastically enhances the resonant properties of the human body, transforming it into an electrical capacitor of exceedingly high quality. It was in 2005 that I confirmed the ayurvedic method of curing disease with bioelectrification using electrum water –high-purity water that contains gold and silver nanoparticles (2-15nm in size). In a strange sequence of events, I was studying the bioelectric cure for all disease right before I myself contracted Lyme disease, a bacterial infection from the bite of a deer tick in the Berkeley hills. I cured myself drinking electrum water from La Maná, Ecuador for one month, while walking daily for hours on the beaches to receive the mild electrical currents from nature through my feet! The invisible and tasteless traces of colloidal precious metals transform the body’s conductivity, enabling the thorough electrification of every cell within the body , ensuring the complete eradication of all bacteria and viri in the system in mere weeks. While pioneering medical doctors, following the research of Dr. Bob Beck, have developed handheld devices for delivering bioelectric charges to patients, the gentle electric currents generated at any beach are identical. Not surprisingly, Tesla was the first to describe the therapeutic affect of electrical currents: The cleaning of the body can be instantaneously effected simply by connecting it to a source of electric energy of very high potential, which will result in the throwing off of dust or any small particles adhering to the skin. Such a bath, besides being dry and timesaving would also be of beneficial therapeutic influence. 26 Another notable contemporary of Tesla quoted extensively on the subject was Edgar Cayce (1877-1945), who recorded in his memoirs Tesla’s inquiring visits although Cayce’s reading for Tesla was never published. Cayce described electrum colloids as well as reincarnation: "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 16 Concerning life forces themselves; that certain elements are a part of the physical manifestation of the spiritual and mental forces, from a chemical reaction – [involving] silver and gold .

Cayce’s prophetic scientific explanation of reincarnation has been thoroughly confirmed in our time, as the human genome has been mapped and heredity still not yet explained by genes alone. Edgar Cayce (above, left) predicted his own return in 1997, which coincides with the life path and facial features of David Wilcock (above, right). The extensive reincarnation studies of Dr. Ian Stevenson have statistically demonstrated a correlation between congenital deformities and birthmarks on children that correspond to their memories of past life trauma and forensic data of the deceased individual whose life was remembered . By recording remembered histories and comparing with actual records, Stevenson et al. have conclusively validated reincarnation memories with statistical observations. Literally hundreds of thousands of cases of reincarnation memories have been researched worldwide by other pioneering scientists such as Dr. Helen Wambach, Dr. Jim Tucker and Dr. Jurgen Kiel. Direct evidence proves the memory of the soul. Advanced concepts regarding the spiritual physics of reincarnation are also to be found in the contact notes of Eduard “Billy” Albert Meier, whose extraterrestrial teachers provide precise scientific explanations. Meier’s dedicated group founded the Semjase Silver Star Center in Hinterschmidrüti, Switzerland (47.41°N 8.90°E), located exactly 1,688 miles from the Giza pyramids, along a circle of focused infrasound with a radius of 6.7% of the Earth’s mean circumference. The spiritual center was named after Meier’s teacher Semjase, a very youthful woman of over 330 years from the planet Erra, in orbit of Taygeta, a star in the Pleiades system (circled, following page). “A rebirth of a spirit-conditioned human being can take place after the death of his physical body, in seconds, decades, thousands of years or millennia.” 27 Meier has recorded the spiritual science of the Plejaren, defining the human spirit as a ‘fine-matter’ form of energy – much less dense than tangible ‘coarse-matter’ objects and human bodies. Meier himself is also a water bearer born under the astrological sign of Aquarius on February 3, 1937. Furthermore, the Plejaren explain the coming effects of the Age of Aquarius as playing a decisive role in the rapid technological advances and inspired minds of our tumultuous era: "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 17 When a spirit leaves his frame (of flesh), he cannot just go anywhere. He has to vivify a body again, or he goes into a fine-material world, a spirit-form-world thus, of which there are innumerable ones. There the spirit lives in an individual form for so long, until he returns again into a newly created guest-body. This means: each spirit has an especially tuned for him dwelling (body), in which he lives out his life in material form. One can observe... that the facial appearance of the guest bodies is nearly always much the same, and only changes very slowly, until a high spiritual level has been attained. At very low or very high spiritual position, the faces of all guest bodies (of a given spirit) begin to resemble one another. 28 The in-dwelling spirit has stored only those matters and things which it collected in the course of its material existence in material bodies and lives. This, according to your understanding, is very much, but in truth is very little. During innumerable further lives, the spirit must explore further, must search, and must find; thus he must assemble further knowledge, recognitions and experiences, which then establish themselves in him as faculties. Because the spirit continues after the material death of the body, and exists within spheres of living of the “other world”, it works upon the achieved results of the other lives, and fixes these results inside it in what you call “the subconscious”. Upon taking up the human form of life again, the obtained knowledge and faculty is anchored in the subconscious, and must evolve slowly in the human form of life to help in new lessons and recognitions toward developing conscious talents... 29 Further necessary knowledge regards a cosmic change... of the “Age of Aquarius”, also called the “Golden Age”. In this respect I must first explain the religious interpretations concerning this epoch are wrong... By no means is this new age a final time, because in truth it brings real life . This epoch enables everything to develop to highest potential, including spirit, according to providence. But it will take many centuries after entering this period to reach such advanced levels... Caused by the change of epoch, religious people will fall into fanatical religious delusion. Especially [during] the 184 years of the time of change, religious beliefs of all sorts will shoot up like mushrooms and bring many humans under their control... This is the initial phase of the “Golden Age”, the transition phase of 184 years. The culmination of this period will come in 2028 (our years). The revolutionary force of this new epoch has begun in 1844, and since then the extensive alterations on Earth rush irresistibly forward... The first half of the transition period lasted 92 years, until 1936, while the Earth felt the last of the “Age of Pisces” (as it is called). Since that time, rapidly evolving events, discoveries, inventions, etc., were characteristic as for no other time. This whole sun system with all its innumerable creatures is under the control of the new age. Each and everything is influenced by it, because this is a cosmic law... The origin of this epochal change is the radiation of the huge central sun around which your system circles once in 25,860 years, and passes through 12 epochs within the meaning of your astrologer’s Zodiacs. The Earth has already touched the outer borders of the “Golden Radiation” of the central sun, which are of the strongest and most revolutionary radiation... The way-showers of these changes are in cosmic destiny and appear under the Creation laws. The way- preparers for these revolutions (affecting humans) are also human beings who, as prophets and teachers, announce the truths of knowledge and spiritual wisdom. These way-preparers will be considered revolutionaries, heretics, and exiles, for they will announce the truths for all to see. 30 "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 18 References   1 Tesla N (1932) ‘Tesla Cosmic Ray Motor May Transmit Power Round Earth’ Brooklyn Eagle, July 10 2 Tesla N (1982) ‘My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla’ Hart Brothers, Vermont, p. 106 3 De Aquino F (2000) ‘Possibility of Control of the Gravitational Mass by Means of Extra-Low Frequency Radiation’ Los Alamos National Laboratory preprint gr-qc/0005107 · http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0005107 4 O’Neill J (1944) ‘Prodigal Genius, The Life of Nikola Tesla’ Ives Washburn, New York, pp. 253- 254 5 Nikhilananda S (1973) ‘Vivekananda, the Yogas and Other Works’ Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, New York 6 Burke ML (1985) ‘Swami Vivekananda in the West’ Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, India, p. 500 7 Putney A (2007) ‘Sacred Ayurvedic Waters’ online · http://www.humanresonance.org/water.html 8 Tesla N (1904) ‘The Transmission of Electrical Energy Without Wires’ Electrical World and Engineer, March 5 9 -- (2007) ‘MIT Demonstrates Wireless Power Transfer’ Science Daily, June 8 , online · http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070607171130.htm 10 Lai H, Singh NP (1996) ‘Single- and Double-strand DNA Breaks in Rat Brain Cells After Acute Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Radiation’ Int.

In a low-lit room I easily meditate on breath with my eyes closed, and as my mind’s dialog ceases I see complex woven patterns moving slowly and steadily across my field of vision; transparent orbs skipping by, or meandering like bioluminescent jellyfish; enveloping clouds of light that flash up from the depths of my mind like reflections off the bodies of millions of tiny fish. A throbbing hum flows perpetually like a river through my mind, the flood-level rising in the night hours to fill my awareness. At times, I feel heat rising at my crown. When I saw the first high-resolution videos of solar flares I was filled with an inexpressible elation, as I had seen those exact images before –in brightly flashing geometric mental images (compared below). I jumped like a child in boundless joy. The waves of flashes and flaming rainbows that burned in my mind also burned on the surface of the sun! I had already spent years visualizing counter-rotating standing storms –the third eye of Jupiter, of Neptune; Titan’s bright spot. I had even been able to digitally model those exact patterns, and found them as mandalas among solar cultures from every part of the world. I began to see, hear and feel the force of infrasound move through me. These surging infrasound levels are igniting fires, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes in this same octagonal pattern– in Messina, Sicily; in Ratria, India; in Bodibe, South Africa; in Santa Barbara, California and elsewhere. Both the safety and spiritual growth of human beings are linked with these building resonant changes. The Earth’s urgent warnings to humanity are given through low humming and mandala crop formations that reignite human memory of our ancient collective heritage of still-resonating ayurvedic pyramids. This Earth shift will strengthen the planet’s magnetic field and human ingenuity with it inexorably, as Tesla acknowledged: Man has stored within him the creative genius for anything he requires and that after a certain period of incubation and when the need is great enough the invention for a given need suddenly appears. \"I know,\" he explained, \"that I can create any machine necessary for my needs simply by putting my mind to the problem. It is easy once Nature has given you the gift for creative work”... 1 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 21"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 22 "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 23 Extensive spiritual information was given to Swiss prophet Eduard Albert Meier by wise visitors from the Pleiades star cluster, including teachings on the process of illumination of human consciousness through 7 periods, within which scores of successive incarnations are undertaken to achieve specific developments. The teaching prescribes specific meditation conditions that synchronize collective human consciousness with the cosmic culture, literally described as billions of sentient minds simultaneously intoning one peace mantra. The truth of the oral teachings of the Plejaren are supported by Meier’s massive archive of material evidences including short films, audio recordings and hundreds of clear photographs of Plejaren ‘beamship’ spacecraft and aerial shots taken from inside , as well as unique extraterrestrial crystals and metal alloys that astound scientists. Several historic documents have informed the world of Eduard Meier’s prophecies, the first being his 1952 letter to world governments that scientifically foretells of all of the major events of our times. Meier’s 1963 discovery of an ancient resin-encased Aramaic document in a cave near Jerusalem may be primary documentation of the teachings of the man now referred to as Jesus Christ –the Talmud Jmmanuel: People obtain experience in the use of their powers and capabilities only by trying daily to unfold them. So long as people do not become one with Creation, they will never be able to rise above death or near-death, since fear of the unknown is in them; and only when they can fully recognize the perfection and unity of Creation can they slowly gain eminence. Instead of being guided by instincts and impulses, people should live according to knowledge and wisdom so that they may live justly according to the laws and commandments. People shall not lose their way in the forest of limitations, but shall expand their consciousness and seek and find knowledge, logic and truth, and from it learn wisdom, so that they may come closer to their lives’ goal and recognize the creative principle in all things. Thousands of lights will guide them on their paths, if they watch and follow them. People will attain all their knowledge and wisdom, if they seriously strive for perfection. The laws serve all those who are willing to seek truth in unlimited measure and to learn wisdom from it, inasmuch as they master within themselves all possible dimensions, develop their spiritual powers higher and higher and in so doing perfect themselves. 2 Despite the original scrolls having been destroyed by fire during an Israeli military raid, the authenticity of the Talmud Jmmanuel translation has been extensively researched by comparative analysis with the Gospel of Matthew, exposing obvious word and phrase substitutions in the Bible that confuse the original me anings so clear in the words of Jmmanuel. In Jmmanuel’s profound and straight-forward description of the laws of Creation and the process of human spiritual learning is a very interesting designation of luminous phenomena as a kind of spiritual guidance system: “Thousands of lights will guide them on their paths, if they watch and follow them.” This is a conclusion that I have also come to in my experience and spiritual seeking, and one that Tesla had also arrived at – that impulse-driven behavior is a kind of automation of human consciousness, while self-motivated scientific investigation results in a ‘brilliant idea’ or spiritual cognition that becomes energetically expressed as flashes of light around one’s body, precisely following the moment of insight. Tesla acknowledged as much in his breakthrough experiences: I never had any control over the flashes of light... [that] were, perhaps, my strangest experience and inexplicable. They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous or distressing situation or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances I have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about twenty-five years old... these luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me... 3 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 24 Interestingly, despite all of Tesla’s close work with electrical standing waves, he did not draw the conclusion that I have arrived at– that these flashes of light are actually airborne plasma discharges moving along the invisible standing waves. This hypothesis is borne out by dozens of luminous flashes that have been captured on video downlink from NASA space missions, later discovered in single frames by video editor Martyn Stubbs. 4 One particularly interesting frame (below) captures a red/pink plasma discharge streaking across the Earth’s thin horizon, amplifying the crescent Earth’s reflected light where it is crossed by the discharge. This detail is consistent with the properties of plasma. The multicolor flashes were also observed inside the shuttle and commented on by awestruck astronauts Mark Lee and Steven Smith on live audio/video downlink to mission control, during the 1997 Hubble Repair Mission STS- 82: Mark: What was that flash?... I saw a light flash past me just here. Did you see it? Steven: ... [Laughs] I just thought it was my imagination. Mark: Yeah, I saw it too... so it’s not. There were two of them. There’s another one. What are they? Steven: I thought I saw the lights flickering in here. Mark: Who’d be taking pictures? What is this? Steven: It’s just gone past in front of us. Martyn Stubbs presents dozens of NASA downlink video frames that clearly capture streaking luminous flashes that appear for mere nanoseconds. Most people who see such flashes dismiss them due to the extreme brevity of the experience, but when the flashes occur in series, as recorded on the STS- 82 shuttle mission, witnesses are able to reconfirm their observations. The highly charged electrical environment of the space shuttle while in orbit of Earth presents a perfect opportunity to witness and capture the phenomena, while on Earth it occurs more rarely. The hypothesis that the flashes of light are plasma phenomena igniting along infrasound standing waves near 1.5 Hz is supported by other strange electrical and acoustical anomalies in Earth orbit reported on several occasions by cosmonauts in 2004: The two men aboard the international space station heard a strange metallic sound again Friday, four months after being startled by it the first time. Cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri was talking to flight controllers in Moscow when he heard a loud drum-like noise coming from the instrument panel of the station's... living quarters. Kaleri and astronaut Michael Foale first heard the mystery noise - described as a flapping sheet of metal - back in late November. Neither the crewmen nor flight controllers were ever able to identify the sound, although engineers suspected space junk may have damaged something on the exterior. Kaleri said Friday morning's noise came from about the same place as before and sounded the same. \"I had the headset on, so I didn't hear it very clearly. But it sounded sort of like a drum. It sounds sort of like a sheet of something being bent,\" the cosmonaut reported. Russian flight controllers told Kaleri that they would try to figure out where the noise was coming from, and speculated that perhaps one of the systems inside the station was the source of the problem, rather than something on the outside. NASA officials, however, said all systems appeared to be operating properly. \"It's very strange,\" Russian Mission Control said. \"I doubt that it would be a coincidence that you're hearing the same thing coming from the same place.\" During a spacewalk in February, Kaleri and Foale were supposed to check the exterior of the space station where the noise originated last November. But Kaleri's spacesuit overheated and became damp, and the spacewalk had to be cut short, so the men did not have time to inspect the area... 5 While scientific descriptions of this sound or any analysis of the frequencies recorded are completely beyond the scope of the news brief, the few descriptive details provided are enough to draw a connection between the acoustical anomaly and the electrical anomaly. Ultra-low-frequency resonance of electrical "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 25 standing waves is likely causing the drumming. The fact that Kaleri's investigative spacewalk was not possible as his spacesuit overheated is another result of the electrical effects of the infrasound standing wave resonance. After the sound had been dismissed as the result of 'space junk' NASA directed a spacewalk mission that was abruptly aborted, yet no link has been drawn between the anomalous acoustic energy heard with the anomalous heating of the astronaut's spacesuit. In fact, the infrasound beating was directly transduced into electricity by the metals in the spacesuit itself. These acoustic and electric events are caused by the same resonance that produced the flashes on STS- 82. The sacred Native American knowledge of the Hopi Elders warns of a \"dwelling-place in the heavens\" that will fall from the sky to be destroyed as the final sign before the beginning of the new Fifth World. The infrasound energy that is likely causing the noisy drumming and the overheating of the cosmonaut's spacesuit will likely recur for a longer duration, building an electrical charge capable of rendering the systems of the Space Station inoperable. The stark ancient prophecies of the Hopi culture are continuing their remarkable pattern of fulfillment, having accurately foretold the white European invasion in all of its odd technological details, including the web of power lines running Tesla’s alternating currents: I am White Feather, a Hopi of the ancient Bear Clan... My people await Pahana, the lost White Brother, as do all our brothers in the land. He will not be like the white men we know now, who are cruel and greedy, we were told of their coming long ago. But still we await Pahana. He will bring with him the symbols, and the missing piece of that sacred tablet now kept by the elders, given to him when he left, that shall identify him as our True White Brother. The Fourth World shall end soon, and the Fifth World will begin. This the elders everywhere know. The Signs over many years have been fulfilled, and so few are left. This is the First Sign: We are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like Pahana (but not living like Pahana); men who took the land that was not theirs; men who struck their enemies with thunder. [gunfire] This is the Second Sign: Our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes – the white men bringing their families in wagons across the prairies. This is the Third Sign: A strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These White Feather saw with his eyes – the coming of the white men's cattle. This is the Fourth Sign: The land will be crossed by snakes of iron. [trains and railroads] This is the Fifth Sign: The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider's web. [telephone lines] This is the Sixth sign: The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun. [roads] This is the Seventh Sign: You will hear of the sea turning black [due to oil spills], and many living things dying... This is the Eight Sign: You will see many youth, [hippies] who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom. And this is the Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the Earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease. These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock to and fro. The white man will battle against other people in other lands – with those who possessed the first light of wisdom. There will be many columns of smoke and fire such as White Feather has seen the white man make in the deserts not far from here. Only those which come [after the ninth and final sign] will cause disease and a great dying. Ma ny of my people, understanding the prophecies, shall be safe. Those who stay and live in the places of my people also shall be safe. Then there will be much to rebuild. And soon - very soon afterward - Pahana will return. He shall bring with him the dawn of the Fifth World. He shall plant the seeds of his wisdom in their hearts. Even now the seeds are being planted. These shall smooth the way to the Emergence into the Fifth World. 6 "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 26 Native American traditions describe the conscious spirit of Earth as vivifying all life in endless circles of energy. Sacred sites are known to the indigenous cultures as Earth’s vibratory centers where human awareness and consciousness are naturally enhanced. Among the cultures of the southwest the corn stalk and double helix symbolize life energy, as seen in complex Navajo sand paintings (above) that express the acoustic alignments of the sacred sites where the sand paintings are executed. Ancient knowledge of the unitive power of the circle is obtained in visions like those of Apache Elder Black Elk: [T]he great Voice said: \"Behold the circle of the nation's hoop, for it is holy, being endless, and thus all powers will be one power in the people without end\"... 7 Then I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and around about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world. And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being. And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy... 8 You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round. In the old days when we were a strong and happy people, all our power came to us from the sacred hoop of the nation, and so long as the hoop was unbroken, the people flourished. The flowering tree was the living center of the hoop, and the circle of the four quarters nourished it. The east gave peace and light, the south gave warmth, the west gave rain, and the north with its"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 27 cold and mighty wind gave strength and endurance. This knowledge came to us from the outer world with our religion. Everything the Power of the World does is done in a circle. The sky is round, and I have heard that the Earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls. Birds make their nests in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle. The moon does the same, and both are round. Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The life of man is a circle, from childhood to childhood, and so it is with everything where power moves. Our teepees were round like the nests of birds, and these were always set in a circle, the nation's hoop, a nest of many nests, where the Great Spirit meant for us to hatch our children. But the Wasichus have put us in these square boxes. Our power is gone and we are dying, for the power is not in us any more... the Grandfathers had shown me my people walking on the black road and how the nation's hoop would be broken and the flowering tree be withered, before I should bring the hoop together with the power that was given me, and make the holy tree to flower in the center and find the red road again. 9 The Tree of Life is a spiritual term for immense standing waves of infrasound that are perceptible to seers who have developed their awareness by ancient methods taught to apprentices like Carlos Castaneda: “The old seers saw that the Earth has a cocoon,” he went on. “They saw that there was a ball encasing the Earth, a luminous cocoon that entraps the Eagle’s emanations. The Earth is a gigantic sentient being subjected to the same forces we are”... He explained that what he called the key to everything was the first-hand knowledge that the Earth is a sentient being and as such can give warriors a tremendous boost; it is an impulse that comes from the awareness of the Earth itself at the instant in which the emanations inside the warriors’ cocoons are aligned with the appropriate emanations inside the Earth’s cocoon. Since both the Earth and man are sentient beings, their emanations coincide, or rather, the Earth has all the emanations that are present in man and all the emanations present in all sentient beings, organic or inorganic for that matter. When a moment of alignment takes place, sentient beings use that alignment in a limited way and perceive their world. Warriors can use that alignment either to perceive, like everyone else, or as a boost that allows them to enter unimaginable worlds... Don Juan restated over and over that the portion of the emanations inside man’s cocoon is in there only for awareness, and that awareness is matching that portion of the emanations with the same portion of emanations at large. They are called emanations at large because they are immense... inside man’s cocoon the unknown is the emanations untouched by awareness. When the glow of awareness touches them, they become active and can be aligned with the corresponding emanations at large. Once that happens the unknown is perceived and becomes the known. 10 “They say that perception is a condition of alignment... Alignment is what allows awareness to be cultivated by every living creature...” When seers see perception, they witness that the luminosity of the... emanations outside those creatures’ cocoons brightens the luminosity inside their cocoons. The outside luminosity attracts the inside one; it traps it, so to speak, and fixes it. That fixation is the awareness of every specific being. 11 The circular aspect... is what maintains life and awareness, fulfillment and purpose... The reason that it’s called the circular force is that it comes in rings, thread-like hoops of iridescence... it strikes all living beings ceaselessly... to give them strength, direction, awareness; to give them life... It’s one indivisible force that fits all living beings, organic and inorganic. 12 Yaqui Elder Juan Matus provides us with a most concise explanation of the influence of Earth resonance on human consciousness by alignment with immense infrasound standing waves, or “emanations”. His description of alignment matches exactly the scientific findings of the frequency following response of human biorhythms that automatically synchronize with the environmental impulses. By this explanation, my own ability to hear infrasound humming developed by the act of listening for it in meditation. Arizona’s Hopi Elders have foretold that the rising planetary resonance will bring major changes to all forms of life: The return of the Blue Star Katchina who is also known as Nan ga sohu will be the alarm clock that tells us of the new day and new way of life, a new world that is coming. This is where the changes will begin. They will start as fires that burn within us, and we will burn up with desires and conflict if we do not remember the original teachings, and return to the peaceful way of life."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 28 Not far behind the twins will come the Purifier, the Red Katchina, who will bring the Day of Purification. On this day the Earth, her creatures and all life as we know it will change forever. There will be messengers that will precede this coming of the Purifier. They will leave messages to those on Earth who remember the old ways. Messages will be found written in the living stone, through the sacred grains, and even the waters (‘crop circles’ have been found in ice). From the Purifier will issue forth a great Red Light. All things will change in their manner of being. Every living thing will be offered the opportunity to change from the largest to the smallest thing. Those who return to the ways given to us in the original teachings, and live a natural way of life will not b e touched by the coming of the Purifier. They will survive and build the new world. Only in the ancient teachings will the ability to understand the messages be found. It is important to understand that these messages will be found upon every living thing, even within our bodies, even within a drop of our blood. All life forms will receive the messages from the twins... those that fly, the plants, even the rabbit. The appearance of the twins begins a period of seven years and will be our final opportunity to change our ways. Everything we experience is all a matter of choice... When the Purifier comes we will see him first as a small Red Star, which will come very close and sit in our heavens watching us. Watching us to see how well we have remembered the sacred teachings. This Purifier will show us many miraculous signs in our heavens. In this way we will know Creator is not a dream. Even those who do not feel their connection to spirit will see the face of creator across the sky. Things unseen will be felt very strongly. Many things will begin to occur that will not make sense, for reality will be shifting back in and out of the dream state. There will be many doorways to the lower world that will open at this time. Things long forgotten will come back to remind us of our past creations. All living things will want to be present for this day when time ends, and we enter the forever cycle of the Fifth World. We will receive many warnings allowing us to change our ways from below the Earth as well as above. Then, one morning in a moment, we will awaken to the Red Dawn. The sky will be the color of blood; many things will then begin to happen that right now we are not sure of their exact nature, for much of reality will not be as it is now. There will be many strange beasts upon the Earth in those days, some from the past and some that we have never seen. The nature of mankind will appear strange in these times we walk between worlds and we will house many spirits even within our bodies. After a time we will again walk with our brothers from the Stars, and rebuild this Earth but not until the Purifier has left his mark upon the universe. No thing living will go untouched, here or in the heavens. The way through this time it is said is to be found in our hearts, and reuniting with our spiritual self. Getting simple and returning to living with and upon the Earth and in harmony with her creatures. Remembering that we are the caretakers, the fire keepers of the Spirit. Our relatives from the Stars are coming home to see how well we have faired in our journey. 13 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 29 Ancient Hopi wisdom speaks of the oncoming Fifth World of red light, while this presently ending Fourth World has been nourished by the yellow light, like the Third and Second Worlds. They tell us that the Firs t World was nourished by the purple (ultraviolet) light, after the ‘Creation Song’ had prepared the planet for life. Science confirms that all early plant life on Earth was purple, and that plants began using green leaves for photosynthesis only later. 14 The luminous pink atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan has been recently defined as similar to that of early Earth, a rich haze of prime organic material. 15 The Purple light and Creation Song are Hopi terms denoting the Earth’s early atmospheric plasmas and resonant field of infrasound. These ideas are also reflected in the Sanskrit definition of ‘akasha’ being the quintessential element, associated with memory of the spirit, from which originated fire (plasma), water, air and earth. The Hopi inform us of the imminent natural atmospheric change to give off red light, and describe the infrasound humming as “unseen... [but] felt very strongly.” These environmental changes can now be understood as key transformational factors that produce new species by affecting spontaneous DNA alterations among living populations. The Fifth World of Hopi prophecy describes the high-energy environment found naturally inside crop circles, now linked to the plasma orbs first noted by Nikola Tesla: The lightning stroke [forms]... a ball-shaped structure which may be of any size from a couple of inches to a foot in diameter... brightly incandescent and floats like a bubble, being easily carried by [magnetic] currents... Tesla became familiar with the destructive characteristics of fireballs in his experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899. He produced them quite by accident and saw them, more than once, explode and shatter his tall mast and also destroy apparatus within his laboratory... He studied the process by which they were produced, not because he wanted to produce them but in order to eliminate the conditions in which they were created. 16 Scientific inquiry into the nature of plasma orbs has progressed significantly with the advent of high-speed digital video and infrared imaging enabling investigators to record orbs moving at velocities of several hundred miles- per -hour. 17 The rapid velocity and varying translucence of plasma disguises them from three-dimensional human sensory perception, which may only register a momentary flash or flicker of light, or nothing at all. Plasma orbs often appear near crop formations, and were even filmed creating the Wiltshire snowflake formation of August 11, 1996 –downing the 300-foot-long crop glyph in mere seconds!"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 30 The first crop circle rendering of a quadratic equation was discovered on August 11, 1991 in Ickleton, England (above, left); one that had first been digitally rendered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980 –the Mandelbrot Set (above, right). Ickleton (52.18°N 0.17°W) is situated at 8.88% of the Earth’s circumference from the pyramids of Giza, Egypt, along a resonant circle of terrestrial infrasound standing waves.

I visited and analyzed the 2003 Solano, California crop formation (below, left) 18 that was buzzing with activity. This impressive cereal formation in Solano is certainly the largest and most complex yet to appear in California on modern record. The pattern shows a true North alignment that is bent towards the magnetic North pole at the southern end of the formation, in an array of circles that do not quite show a true symmetry. The bending in the long axis of the design occurs at the central cluster of three circles, which may symbolize a molecule of water: 1 hydrogen atom linked with 2 oxygen atoms. Perhaps a deeper reference can be found to water in the offset geometry from geographic North to magnetic North, in that the resonance of a body of is dependent on the purity of its water. The asymmetry of the pattern may be a fundamental aspect of the message showing us that the water content of human beings and of Earth is contaminated by deuterium, or ‘heavy water’, (a low resonance isotope of hydrogen), and the magnetic field has been offset and vastly reduced on our planet and in our bodies. This message is perhaps calling human beings toward the emerging sites of infrasound resonance - a new dimension of energy with the potential to purify the water of the human body and while slowly raising the resonance and broaden the magnetic field of this planet. Another beautiful crop formation in Solano of June 17, 2004 is somewhat different from the previous year's formation, yet only miles away in Rockville (above, right). While it lacks the majestic size of the earlier formation, the two patterns exhibit a similar distortion from perfect symmetry. Reiterating the message of the previous year’s formation, this mandala can also be seen to represent molecular water, the 3 atoms in this diagram being shown as large circles with small circles showing their sharing of 8 electrons in covalent bonds. The repeated geometric referencing of molecular water is a visual clue to the method of formation: microwave heating of water in plant stem nodes by spherical plasma vortices , as described in the extensive work of Levengood et al. The ‘tail’ of circles that extends to the nearby power transmission tower lets the viewer ‘connect the dots’ –circles... electricity... plasma orbs... California's Solano (38.26°N 122.24°W) crop formation events have occurred 7,457 miles from the Orion pyramids of Giza, a resonant distance that is exactly 30.0% of the Earth’s mean circumference. The precision of these locations created a surge of inspiration for me to continue my research in Berkeley, California, where I had intuitively moved in 2000, as it was now reconfirmed that my home sits along the 30% resonant distance in sacred alignment with Solano, La Maná, Macchu Picchu and Saqsaywaman!"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 32 A mesmerizing mandala formation discovered June 22, 2005 at Lurkley Hill in Lockeridge, England (below, left) is another rare reiteration of a pure math equation: [ z n+1 = z n 2 modulus n ] (below, right).

I became fascinated with the four- dimensional iterated function. So small was this prime seed of resonance, and it appeared everywhere I looked for confirmation. I turned to the ancient wisdom of the Maya. Perhaps the pyramid builders themselves provide resonance maps that I might be able to compare with those from my mental imaging? Elder Hunbatz Men foretells of the activation of Mayan sacred sites (below, right) as radiating progressively from an ignition point at Calakmul –exactly matching the center point as I had defined earlier in a precise digital rendering of z n+1 = z n 2 (below left). Not only do the Mayan pyramids and maps reflect this alignment, but many of the mountain ranges that snake through Mexico also conform to the four-dimensional infrasound pattern. The map’s synchronicity with sacred Mayan wisdom is also striking. As I tirelessly repeated calculations applying the iterated function (z n+1 = z n 2 ) to the distribution pattern of the sacred sites of the world, I gained a new understanding of the deeper mysteries of consciousness and the process of spiritual development. Each season, I absorbed all of the latest findings in the fields, following the widespread excitement, careful biological and geometric analysis of cereologists around the world. Seizing the rare opportunity to experience a crop circle close to my home in Oakland, California, I visited the 2007 Red Bluff formation 19 on May 19 th and 20 th and collected samples of bent stem nodes and expulsion cavities. The Red Bluff site (40.189°N 122.235°W) sits 7,311 miles from Giza, Egypt, a resonant distance that is 29.37% of the Earth's mean circumference. The subtle residual energies of this mandala formation would manifest itself in an unusual luminous experience just ten days later. In the early morning of Tuesday May 29th I awoke from a deeply refreshing sleep to the humming infrasound that is a surging harbinger. A waiting message from my mother, Marilyn, quoted from the Tesla biography by Robinson on the Tunguska event. 20 Reading about Tesla’s false belief that his experiment had caused the Tunguska catastrophe left me in a state of shock that I strangely could not account for, as emotional release flooded my heart in a rush of uncontrolled feelings. I crumbled inward, and in that moment pinched a nerve at the nape of my neck that sent a jolt of pain shooting through me, shifting into a paralyzing bodily fever. Some hidden cosmic pain flowed out of me while slowly being replaced with what felt like an envelope of energy –a sensation of friction like a rising level of hot sand filling my hollow shell, from my toes upward . The intense wave progressed slowly until the corona of heat enveloped my head and a spectral haze of oscillations filled my peripheral vision, obscuring all but a circular portal. There entranced, my body collapsed. The tumultuous energy of latent knowledge has finally culminated in this autobiographical work, in which I provide a possible explanation for the origin of my research and theoretical work being in the embedded life memories of Nikola Tesla."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 34 I had been fully aware of the Fibonacci structures presented in crop circles the world over, yet another related code had also been found among prime numbers by chemist Peter Plichta. Prime numbers present a synchronous, non-repeating cross pattern (above) based on a cycle of six, expressed as 6 n±1. Being a universal constant “the ‘Prime Number Cross’ is not a human invention. It is in fact a model of the construction plan with which infinity was made finite in the structure of the atoms,” 21 bound together by standing waves resonantly interconnecting the cosmos in the mandala form. In deciphering these universal codes I found a new model of quantum gravity that explains resonant acoustic levitation. Yellowwood State Park, IN 22 has been the focus of attention since May 2000, after a sandstone boulder that must have weighed near 400 lbs was discovered lodged in a fork at the top of an eighty-foot chestnut oak tree, subsequently nicknamed Gobbler’s Rock. Several other similar situations in the vicinity were discovered after local investigators heard the news, yet the mystery of their lofty placement only deepened. In March 2003, a hiker in the neighboring Limon State Park, IN 23 was equally surprised to find a four-foot wide boulder in a high fork of a forty-foot tree. Interestingly, during this same time period extensive research into the physics of acoustic levitation 24 was published in science journals worldwide, yet beyond the awareness of the Indiana State Park investigators. The piezoelectric property of the quartz that is the main constituent of the treetop sandstone boulders allows their levitation by focused sound waves. The internal reflection of the parallel faces of the quartz crystals allows the acoustic energy to be stored inside the stone. The build-up of vibratory energy within the quartz lattice creates an electromagnetic field reducing the stone's weight until it becomes entirely weightless, levitating without friction along the arch of the standing wave."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 35 The source of the focused standing waves levitating these stones is the Giza pyramids of Egypt exactly 6,225 miles away (Gobbler's Rock - 39.20°N 86.35°W). This distance is precisely 25.00% of the Earth’s mean circumference. Such unusual acoustic levitation is a sign that a new resonance is emerging in central Indiana, and will be building gradually into a higher energy level that has already been observed at other infrasound focal points. Other astounding events are taking place at this resonant 25% distance from the pyramids, caused by the same resonance but manifesting quite differently. In Abadiânia, Brazil, healing medium João de Deus 25 performs multitudes of miraculous surgeries daily without anesthesia or bleeding. Scores of handicapped patients walk out of the House of Dom Ignacio, where João provides healing without charging any fees, in accordance with the spirit for whom the center is named. The procedures of the house have been specifically prescribed by the spirits through João to bring the ailing patients into resonance with the high ambient energy levels at the chosen location. The confluence of spiritual energies enabling João’s healings is focused on the Abadiânia area by the octagonal geometry of the Giza pyramids. Abadiânia, Brazil (16.1°S 48.8°W) is 6,180 miles from Giza, or 24.82%. This one-quarter-distance relationship of Abadiânia with Giza confirms the sacred geometric configuration of a square within a circle. The throbbing pulse of Earth’s heartbeat reflects the solar culmination, causing panic at focal points throughout the world. Comprehensively recorded by T. Moir (11/06) in North Auckland, New Zealand, 26 the infrasound is causing extensive tremor and fire damage in the Berici Hills of Italy; 27 Messina, Sicily; 28 Ratria, India; 29 Klai, Vietnam; 30 and Bodibe, South Africa. 31 In the US, the hum vibrates Knoxville, TN; 32 Seattle, WA; 33 Denver, CO; 34 Vallejo, CA; 35 Atwater, CA; 36 and Santa Barbara, CA. 37 The mega-quakes felt in Nazca, Peru (08/07) and before the Indian Ocean mega-tsunami (12/04) are also aligned. As discussed earlier, the powerful drum-like beating of Earth resonance has even been heard onboard the International Space Station. 38 The spherical resonance diagram below by Gugg et al. 39 presents the nonlinear structure of standing wave resonances (with distances in miles and percent added by this author).

The golden ratio (1 : 1.618) is also referred to as the Fibonacci ratio, expressed in the Fibonacci series - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, etc... An intriguing relationship exists between the Fibonacci sequence and prime numbers. One may note that in many cases Fibonacci numbers that are prime are also placed at a prime location within the sequence itself. For example, 13 is a Fibonacci number that is prime, and it is 7 th in the series (7 also being prime). The series of these special cases of ‘Fibonacci prime pairs’ begins: F#1 = 1, F#2 = 1, F#3 = 2, F#5 = 5, F#7 = 13, F#11 = 89, F#13 = 233, F#17 = 1597, F#23 = 28657, F#29 = 514229, F#43 = 433494437, F#47 = 2971215073, F#83 = 99194853094755497 ... A profound feeling for these sacred patterns has grown out of a deepening search for the universal order. I have further developed my synesthetic experience of lucent patterns within numbers by mentally modeling holographic images in four dimensions. I have developed a fascination for the Mandelbrot set and a most useful set of three Fibonacci number prime pairs – the 131 st , 137 th , 359 th in the sequence: F#131 = 1066340417491710595814572169, F#137 = 19134702400093278081449423917 and F#359 = 47542043773 4698220747368027166749382927701417016557193662268716376935476241. The correct application of these number prime Fibonacci sets struck me in sharp moments of insight when looking at the geometries of the world’s pyramids and the circle. Carl Munck 40 was the first cryptographer to crack the geometric code of the pyramids based on the Giza prime meridian, as the numbers inherently presented in the polygonal architecture of each structure correspond to its exact global positioning relationship with the Giza pyramids. Further study by Jim Alison 41 revealed the Sine Wave alignments and the prime Fibonacci distance relationships of Giza with Angkor, Cambodia and Nazca, Peru - two antipodal sites. The set of resonant distances based on these Fibonacci relationships is presented below, both in miles and percent of Earth’s mean circumference: This Fibonacci synchronicity is a transcendental acoustic code, mathematically confirming beyond any doubt that the mile is the sacred unit of measurement precisely calibrated to F#361 (12446...) and used by pyramid and megalith builders globally for millennia. However, infrasound resonance can be perceived by ultra-sensitive humans, allowing various pyramid and mound architects to know where to build within the phi network without necessarily using the mile to calculate the global macro-geometry. The fundamental constructs of both prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers combine to form a structural model of acoustic resonance that can be applied to any sphere– a planet or even the hemispheric brain. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 37 The human brain at resonance allows a mental state called synesthesia, which entangles the sensual experience of sounds, smells, colors, shapes and patterns. One of the most remarkable synesthetes is Daniel Paul Tammet (below), a young British man whose abstract four-dimensional mental imaging allows lightening-fast, complex math calculations. Tammet’s holographic memory took the world by surprise on March 14, 2004 at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, when his recitation of the transcendental number Pi shattered the British and European Pi recall record in aid of the National Society for Epilepsy. In just under five hours and ten minutes Daniel correctly recited his favorite number, Pi (3.1415926535897...), to 22,514 digits. Tammet’s exceptional talents provide penetrating insight into the nature of consciousness. He succinctly relates his unusual perceptual experience of mathematics that began as flashes of dynamic visual imagery shortly after a series of epileptic seizures at age four: I’m seeing things in my head like little sparks firing off, and it’s not until the last moment that those sparks tell me what on Earth they mean... I’m seeing the numbers –but I’m not seeing them– it’s strange. I’m seeing pictures, shapes and patterns; almost like a square; like the texture of water; drops, ripples almost; like something reflective. It’s something you can look through, almost metallic; like bubbles; like a half-cloud; a little bit like a flash... I experience numbers in a very visual way using colors, texture, shape and form. Sequences of numbers form landscapes in my mind. It just happens. Its like I’m in a fourth dimension. One, for example, would be very bright... a very bright and shiny number. Its almost like somebody flashing a light in my face... you know, it’s a very –a very interesting experience. Number two is kind of like a movement, right to left, kind of like a drifting motion. Five is like the clap of thunder or the sound of a wave against the rock. Six is very small... its actually the number I find hardest to experience in any sort of meaningful visual way, so its often the absence of anything, its like a hole or a chasm –or like a black hole. Number nine is the biggest number, it’s very tall... it can be intimidating. [When making a complex calculation] I see an image in my head, and that image starts to change, starts to almost, like, evolve. It’s quite vague at first. As I’m looking at it, it becomes clearer and clearer over a time, and then from that landscape I can read the digits out... 42 Tammet was diagnosed at the age of twenty-five with a rare form of functional autism called Asperger’s syndrome. Daniel’s symptoms do not interfere with his daily life, but enforce a rigorous structure: “I have an almost obsessive need for order and routine which affects virtually every aspect of my life. For example, I eat exactly 45 grams of porridge for breakfast each morning; I weigh the bowl with an electronic scale to make sure. Then I count the number of items of clothing I am wearing before I leave my house. I get anxious if I can’t drink my cups of tea at the same time each day.” 43 He has been able to adapt to his multi-dimensional abilities to enjoy a visually rich and expressive life. This is quite a rare achievement indeed, for as Daniel well knows, “the line between profound talent and profound disability seems really a surprisingly thin one.” 44 While the onset of Daniel’s abilities has been linked to epileptic seizures during childhood, his astrological chart also holds synchronous clues that he notes with clarity: I was born on January 31, 1979 –a Wednesday. I know I was a Wednesday, because the date is blue in my mind, like the number 9 or the sound of loud voices arguing. I like my birth date, because of the way I am able to visualize most of the numbers in it as smooth and round shapes, similar to pebbles on a beach. That’s because they are prime numbers: 31, 19, 197, 97, 79 and 1979 are all divisible only by themselves and 1. I can recognize every prime up to 9,973 by their “pebble-like” quality. It’s just the way my brain works... 45 I have always been fascinated by prime numbers. I see each prime as a smooth-textured shape, distinct from composite number (not primes) that are grittier and less distinctive. Whenever I identify a number as prime, I get a rush of feeling in my head (in the front center) which is hard to put into words. It’s a special feeling, like the sudden sensation of pins and needles. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 38 Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine the first thirty, fifty, hundred numbers as I experience them spatially, synesthetically. Then I can see in my mind’s eye just how beautiful and special the primes are by the way they stand out so sharply from the other number shapes. It’s exactly for this reason that I look and look and look at them; each one is so different than the one before and the one after. Their loneliness among the other numbers makes them so conspicuous and interesting to me. There are moments, as I’m falling into sleep at night, that my mind fills suddenly with bright light and all I can see are numbers –hundreds, thousands of them– swimming rapidly over my eyes. The experience is beautiful and soothing to me. Some nights, when I’m having difficulty falling asleep, I imagine myself walking around my numerical landscapes. Then I feel safe and happy. I never feel lost, because the prime number shapes act as signposts. 46 Prime numbers also appear to act as astrological signposts for dates of significance to the path of human learning. Daniel Tammet was born in the astrological sign of Aquarius, a water bearer like myself and Eduard Meier. All of our birth dates contain prime numbers. Meier was born on February 3, 1937; showing prime numbers 2, 3, 19, 193, 937 and 37. In my own birth date appear primes 2, 11, 19, 197 and 97. Tammet also demonstrates a facility with language that is directly enabled by the synesthetic associations that flood his perception, rapidly providing visual stimulae that trigger spontaneous recall of language forms once they have been initially absorbed. He can learn a new language in a week, and currently speaks ten with fluency: English, Finnish, French, German, Lithuanian, Esperanto, Spanish, Romanian, Icelandic and Welsh. Similarly, Nikola Tesla was fluent in eight languages– Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian and Latin. Tesla’s many social peculiarities and well-described synesthetic experiences are now recognized as indicators of Asperger’s syndrome, though in his time he was simply labeled ‘eccentric’. The quiet confidence and reclusive nature of the inventor is captured in a photograph from 1900 (at left), taken after his research triumphs in Colorado Springs, at the age of 44. Nikola spoke frankly about his unusual childhood impulses, many aspects of which persisted into adulthood: I had a violent aversion against the earrings of women but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit but I was fascinated by the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses... I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food –otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I missed I felt impelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours. 47 Tesla preferred walking Manhattan as an aid to his thought process, sometimes circumambulating a building three times before entering. He was adamant about staying in hotel rooms with numbers divisible by three, and in his old age fed pigeons at the park or from the window of his suite on the 33 rd floor of the Hotel New Yorker, where he died. Nikola also reported in his autobiography unusual experiences involving flashes of light that occurred in his youth during moments of danger in water, vividly describing having seen in the flashes visual diagrams of life-preserving information that he automatically used: "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 39 The torture of suppressed breathing was getting unendurable, my brain was reeling and I felt myself sinking. At that moment, when my situation seemed absolutely hopeless, I experienced one of those flashes of light and the structure above me appeared before my vision... [and] I finally succeeded in getting out of the trap when my friends had already given me up and were fishing for my body... Only two years later I fell into a worse predicament [almost being thrown over a river dam by the force of rushing water]. Slowly and gradually I became exhausted and unable to withstand the strain any longer. Just as I was about to let go, to be dashed against the rocks below, I saw in a flash of light a familiar diagram illustrating the hydraulic principle that the pressure of fluid in motion is proportionate to the area exposed, and automatically I turned to my left side. As if by magic the pressure was reduced... I managed to get over [to safety] with the last ounce of my force... 48 Daniel Tammet cites somewhat similar experiences in his home as a very young child: “On one expedition up the stairs with my arms clasping a particularly heavy book, I slipped and fell. The falling motion seemed to fill my mind with rapid flashes of bright and sketchy color, like scattered sunlight. I just sat at the bottom of the stairs, dazzled and sore.” 49 This electro-luminous field that spontaneously flashes data to synesthetic receivers in this manner is the preservative force of oneness that sustains all of life’s rhythms – gravity itself – responsible for the alignment of consciousness by synchronization. The cosmic dance of numbers reveals itself in layers of meaning woven inextricably into the rhythms of consciousness, as reflected in the structure of prime numbers. Not only is Daniel’s birth date revealing, the alignment of his birthplace likewise informs our understanding of the factors that have contributed to his advanced mental ability. Daniel reflects, “What I do... I don’t think it’s something that can’t be explained. Who knows? There may be abilities here that everyone can perhaps tap into in some way.” 50 In fact, the world’s pyramids and megaliths were designed for this very purpose: to synchronize human consciousness into an advanced state of synesthesia, opening the door to collective telepathy. The pyramids’ resonant functioning focuses infrasound in giant circles of standing waves at Fibonacci distances, as shown in the resonant alignments of Tesla’s birthplace and my own. Neural pathway excitations that occurred during Tammet’s seizures were very likely influenced by ultra-low- frequency resonance generating strong electric fields throughout the landscape, once sacred to the ancients, where his remarkable mental condition was developed. Daniel’s childhood home in East London, England (circled above) lies along a circle of infrasound resonance transduced by the pyramids of Giza, Egypt. East London (51.54°N 0.11°W) is 2,184 miles from Giza, a distance that is 8.77% of the Earth’s mean circumference. The Stonehenge megaliths (51.08°N 1.49°W, in red) also share this resonant location, some 2,239 miles from Giza –a distance of precisely 9.0%. This phi alignment is approximated by the doubled values of Fibonacci #134 (451... x 2 = 902...) and F#356 (1122... x 2 = 2244...), accurately reflecting this distance in percent and in miles respectively. Biorhythmic entrainment is the sacred ancient method of inducing synesthesia in initiates. An essential connection exists between the circle, the heartbeat and infrasound humming, as referenced in ancient Sanskrit texts as well as in the personal experiences of synesthetes and various individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and autism. Daniel expressed a childhood fascination for circles: “I liked drawing circles of lots of different sizes. The circle was my favorite shape and I drew it over and over again.” 51 "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 40 As commonly observed among autistic children, Daniel began at the age of two to beat his forehead rhythmically against a particular wall when distressed, and in tantrums would slap himself on the head with his hand. Daniel also recalls having had to stop from humming to himself unconsciously when brought to his attention by others. Psychologists have recognized these rhythmically repeated movements and humming as soothing influences, like being rocked in a cradle, but the reason why this is the case has remained unexplained. The crucial role of infrasound resonance in the synchronization of brainwaves is apparently being simulated by self-induced beating on the head in the heartbeat rhythm, seeking to forcibly entrain the developmental biorhythms that a fetus naturally receives in the womb. The Sanskrit conception of Kundalini energy pulsing through the seven charkas, up the spine from the root chakra at the anus to the crown chakra at the top of the head, well explains why the usual fetal position is inverted with the rear end aligned directly to the mother’s heart. The womb’s biorhythmic environment has been simulated by the infrasound pyramids of the world that inaudibly endows human consciousness with the advanced capacities of ‘enlightened’ savants and spiritual masters in every part of the world. Another fundamental and often overlooked foundation has enabled the unusual holographic abilities of Tesla, Tammet and myself: the unconditional love and support of courageous parents. I would describe my own family in much the same way as Nikola had described his, as a brilliantly gifted group with diverse talents. My parents Marilyn, Allen and Lilia, and only brother Colin are astute linguists, all of us being trilingual with the exception of my second mother Lilia who now speaks six languages. Colin has also mastered several languages that are not spoken, and writes code as a software engineer. Their guidance in life and concern for my education have enabled my unusually intuitive path that has recently unfolded curious past life continuities. My parents have also had reincarnation questions and answers come into their lives, a few years before my own unusual recollections began. I can easily trace my constantly broadening fascination for science directly back to Colin’s lessons on the nature of light and information transmission through the universe according to Einstein’s relativity theory – a theory that is convincingly contradicted by the effortless holographic imaging process of synesthetes. My own creative work has developed from synesthetic perceptions, although I do not suffer from unusual anxieties or feel any impulse for repetition. One might well use the word ‘channeled’ to describe the origin of the synesthetic solutions arrived at by Tesla, Tammet, and myself. Tammet describes “little sparks firing off,” flashing him information and enabling enhanced language skills as also seen in the case of Edgar Cayce, who, when in trance, automatically spoke and wrote in any language required. The limitless capacity of human consciousness is technologically accessed by ancient pyramid traditions, like those of the Hopi, the Apache, the Lakota and the Maya, that are witnessing a worldwide resurgence of attention for the stark accuracy of their many prophecies. Cayce’s readings engendered a reawakening of spiritual awareness in the west, at the very same time that Nikola Tesla’s synesthetic mental imaging gave birth to the wireless world we now inhabit.

Tesla’s synesthetic process of mental imaging penetrated the electro-acoustic workings of the natural order. In searching for the roots of Nikola’s inventive ability in the experiences of previous lives, much continuity is expressed in the life’s work of a prolific visionary of the Renaissance – Le onardo da Vinci . Fascinating new discoveries regarding the life and self-portraiture of da Vinci firmly establish his physical appearance in youth and at middle age, and confirm the real identity of the woman in his most famous painting, ‘The Mona Lisa’. Born Leonardo di Ser Piero on April 15, 1452 in Vinci , Florence, the prodigious artist and inventor died on May 2, 1519 at the age of 67 in Amboise , Indre- et-Loire (present- day France ) . Leonardo’s many intricate paintings and drawings divulge the essential geometries of nature, thoroughly investigating the structures of the human, animal and plant realms. An essential pattern that fascinated Leonardo is the ‘Flower of Life’; a configuration of interpenetrating circles forming a hexagonal matrix like the petals of a flower. This delicate mandala symbolizes the spherical resonance pattern that orders atomic, biological and planetary structures, as clearly seen in snowflakes, ice crystals and the clustering of water molecules. Many ink drawings by da Vinci explore this prime configuration in various compositions (above, right). The hexagonal Flower of Life mandala has also been observed among the serial messages embedded in the agricultural landscape as crop circles, like living shadows of the higher dimensional reality. One of the largest and most complex examples of the Flower of Life symbol that has graced the fields of southern England was discovered in Burderop Down, Wiltshire on July 28, 2003 (above, left). A very similar fo rm - ation appeared exactly one year later in Nukerke, Belgium on July 28, 2004. These impressive agro- glyphs were followed by subsequent Flower of Life crop formations in Calcinaia, Italy on June 17, 2006 and Klein Wiershausen, Germany on June 17, 2007 – events that also occurred exactly one year apart."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 45 One of nature’s most beautiful floral examples of the Flower of Life geometry is observed in the structure of Allium giganteum or 'Purple Sensation', a flowering variety of the onion family with an icosahedral flower head comprised of tiny star-shaped flowers (above). A deeply rooted fascination for the underlying natural geometric order formed the impetus for da Vinci’s exploratory works, which included myriad anatomical studies of flowers, grasses, trees; the vortical formations in flowing water and winds; and the various postures of animals including cats, bears, horses and even mythical creatures like the dragon. His intense interest in airborne flight filled the pages of many notebooks, and would later be collected into a large volume entitled ‘Codex on the Flight of Birds’. This passion for flight would lead Leonardo to design and build many apparati for human flight, including experimental parachutes, helicopters and winged aircraft. The subject of human anatomy also inspired endless observations made from the dissection of cadavers, exploring the mechanics of the limbs and even fetal development in the womb. Leonardo also diligently inked many three-dimensional geometric studies of the platonic solids, several of which found publication in Luca Pacioli’s La Divina Proportione , of 1509. He would visualize insetting all of the platonic solids within a sphere and produced multitudes of ink sketches exploring the variable configurations of arcs and intersection points that emerged from such an exercise. Many of his geometric studies apply the Flow of Life geometry to spheres and hemispheres, presenting hexapolar, quadrupolar"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 46 "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 47 and octopolar alignments in a wide variety of configurations. Relationships presented by triangles, squares and circles when placed on the surface of a sphere held a strong fascination for da Vinci: According to Augusto Marinoni, 'The problem in geometry that engrossed Leonardo interminably was the squaring of the circle. From 1504 on, he devoted hundreds of pages in his notebooks to this question of quadrature [below] ... that so fascinated his mentor Pacioli ... While his investigations produced no appreciable gain for mathematics, it did create a multiplicity of complex and pleasing designs.\" 1 Da Vinci’s naturalistic documentary sketches and pragmatic technical illustrations of invented machinery are sharply contrasted by his purely mathematical diagrams, which boldly delve into the realm of quantum mechanics . Leonardo’s quadratic projections now find relevance in the contemporary study of quantum states, atomic nuclear resonance and acoustic resonance. Da Vinci’s quadratic representations closely reflect the acoustic resonance mapping of spherical standing wave patterns – yet arose in da Vinci’s pure imagination, without the aid of computers, GPS systems and fractal rendering software that scientists apply today. 2 Modern global surveillance resources enable the calculation of the relative geopositions of the world’s pyramids, megaliths, temples and sacred sites, by which the sacred Sanskrit mandala of the square with a circle is decoded using the Golden Ratio, just as Leonardo had done. These geometric mandala patterns form a vital link connecting the life’s work of Leonardo, Nikola and myself. Da Vinci’s studies in quadrature were expressed in the design of Tesla’s giant mandala-shaped spiral coil and spherical capacitor. The Golden Ratio and configurations of spherical geometry fascinated Leonardo, while Tesla’s experiments with electrical standing waves generated spherical lightening and his ashes are, quite appropriately, preserved in a gold spherical urn in Belgrade. My own quantum studies on the spherical mapping of nonlinear standing waves are a direct continuation of the inventive work of these two visionaries. Major breakthroughs in my intuitive research have involved the use of ayurvedic waters with light-emitting gold and silver nanospheres, while the resulting theory of Magnetic Resonance applies the quadratic work that so deeply possessed da Vinci. Further coincidence is found in the name of my birthplace – the Island of St. Croix or Santa Cruz – of the ‘sacred cross’."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 48 The quadratic functions that have spontaneously inundated my perceptions for many years have lead me on a spiritual journey back through previous lifetimes of experience that provide a karmic context for my unusual intuition concerning the essential hidden force of nature. In this life, I have been able to bring completion to the intensive investigations of both da Vinci and Tesla in the form of precise spherical resonance maps of the standing wave fields of electrons, atoms, planets, stars and galaxies. At the core of all physical reality we find one essential energy configuration that binds all together in oneness. Known as the Akashic field, or the ‘sacred cross’, this limitless infrasound field can be visualized as a spherical quantum map (above) derived from the Octagonal Quantum Iterated Function of Dr. A. Jadczyk. 3 "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 49 Another essential spherical visualization of the transcendent infrasound field of Akasha is derived from the iterated function [ z n+1 = z n 2 ] (above) as described two-dimensionally by Paul Bourke in his ‘Circle Squares Fractal’. 4 Having completed these spherical models of standing wave resonance in 2005, I understood that these precise energy configurations governed the movement of electrons through atoms, crystals, planets, suns and galaxies. 5 I felt the bliss of cosmic synchronicity on February 22, 2008, when direct observation of a single electron was reported by scientists in Sweden. 6 There could be no greater or more immediate confirmation of the accuracy of my quantum resonance maps, which exactly predicted the standing wave structure of the electron just 3 years before it was observed by the ‘quantum stroboscope’ . More significant still, the quantum maps reveal the worldwide distribution of nodal points of infrasound standing waves as focused by the global network of pyramids. Standing waves were first identified by Nikola Tesla on July 3, 1899, during a storm at his Colorado Springs Experimental Station 7 :"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 50 The discovery of the stationary terrestrial waves... [indicates] that, despite its vast extent, the entire planet can be thrown into resonant vibration like a little tuning fork; that electrical oscillations suited to its physical properties and dimensions pass through it unimpeded, in strict obedience to a simple mathematical law, has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Earth, considered as a channel for conveying electrical energy... is infinitely superior to a wire or cable, however well designed. 8 Tesla’s worldwide low-frequency communication network was subsequently designed to drive the Earth into resonant vibration using a global configuration of towers, each synchronized to the Earth’s set of infrasound resonances. Such a state of high-resonance vibration was recorded in the infrared spectra by GOES-10 satellite over the Pacific Ocean through the night of December 7-8, 2001, revealing a complex array of concentric circles (above). 9 My past life affinity with quadratic equations and standing waves would provide the subconscious impetus to decode the anomalous energy patterns as nonlinear standing waves, which had just been mathematically modeled in acoustic resonators in 2003 (Cervenka et al 10 ). The unusual satellite image engaged dormant past life impulses, triggering an innate curiosity that would quickly lead to my mapping of global infrasound standing wave patterns by projecting the proper quadratic function from the apex of the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt. The familiarity with sacred geometry and standing wave patterns that drove my spontaneous research interests was expressed much earlier in my childhood fascination for da Vinci’s finest ink drawing, ‘The Proportions of Man’ after Vitruvius, which I studiously copied from a large book at the age of eight, in 1986. Fibonacci order displayed in the nonlinear standing wave maps I developed 20 years later (p. 51) directly informs da Vinci’s squaring of the circle 11 in ‘The Proportions of Man’ (p. 52). As emphasized by the phi-ordered concentric circles and cross (overlaid onto da Vinci’s drawing by this author), the design of Leonardo’s iconic image precisely conforms to this hidden Ø code. 12 Perhaps this model i s the prime ‘Da Vinci Code’ – referenced herein as the quadratic function for nonlinear standing waves."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 51"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 52 "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 53 Leonardo’s most famous painting, known as the ‘Mona Lisa’, has also kept a wealth of secrets. Tradition- ally mistaken as a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, her actual identity was first suggested by Robert Payne in 1979. 13 Historian Maike Vogt-Lüerssen recently identified patterning on the subject’s dark green dress as an emblem of the House of Sforza, confirming her identity as Isabella di Aragona ( † 1470 –1524), Duchess of Milan. 14 Her identity is easily reconfirmed by comparison with other portraits of Isabella (above, left). It is interesting to note that Isabella died on February 11 – the very day of my birth in 1978. Not only had the portrait of Isabella been misidentified, but she has also lost her eyebrows over the years through the successive work of conservationists retouching cracked paint, as noted by researchers in 2007. 15 While Isabella’s eyebrows may remain obscured, her true identity has been ultimately restored: Like a Renaissance detective on the trail of clues laid down by portrait painters 500 years ago, freelance Adelaide historian Maike Vogt-Lüerssen, has for two decades researched the identity of European nobility painted by the great artists, including Leonardo da Vinci. Using the libraries of the three South Australian universities, which hold works by contemporary writers from the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, German born Vogt-Lüerssen, has studied the life and culture of the times and tracked the symbols used by painters to identify their noble subjects. Along the way, she has deduced the identities of people in several famous paintings, among them da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Her conclusions, including the alarming deduction that the identity of the Mona Lisa claimed by the Louvre is impossible and wrong, have yet to gain a foothold in serious art circles. But Vogt-Lüerssen, who has published 14 books, most of them biographies and all of them so far in German, has a growing circle of admirers in minor international art history circles who found her on the internet and have sought her help identifying paintings. Next month she flies to Montpellier in the south of France and then to Florence to speak to European media about her identification of two works, one a Madonna painting she believes is Isabella of Aragon painted by da Vinci in his old age, the other a tiny medallion portrait she has identified as Anna de’ Medici."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 54 Unlike art historians, who examine brush strokes, materials and techniques, Vogt-Lüerssen, 52, who trained as a historian and biologist at the Philipps-University in Marburg before moving to Australia with her family in 1995, relies on the symbols that adorn the paintings. These are the historical markers left by the artist at a time before photography when portraits recorded a person’s family and influence. They were meant to contain a record of exactly who the subjects were... Take the Mona Lisa, which the Louvre has claimed for more than a hundred years is La Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. Not so, says Vogt-Lüerssen whose book, “Who is Mona Lisa? In Search of Her Identity” makes the case for Isabella of Aragon, a young woman of 18 who was at the time married unhappily to her dissolute husband, Gian Galeazzo II Maria Sforza, the Duke of Milan. Vogt-Lüerssen identified on the Mona Lisa’s bodice the symbols of the connected rings of the house of Sforza and below them the connected knots and strings that brought together the dynasties of Visconti and Sforza. With the choice narrowed to one of eight women, Vogt-Lüerssen eliminated all but Isabella whose mother died the previous year (which explained the mourning), who diarists said was unhappy because her husband beat her and who, significantly, was close to da Vinci, the painter at her court, for most of her life. Adding weight to the theory of a possible love affair between the painter and his subject, da Vinci never sold the painting although he was offered vast sums for it and took it with him to France, where he died. Vogt-Lüerssen believes the Madonna painting, which she was asked three years ago to help identify, shows the same Isabella and she is preparing for a press conference in Montpellier where she will explain her verification. Much is at stake; the work picked up by three French friends in a small art shop for next to nothing, could be worth a fortune even though Vogt-Lüerssen believes it was painted late in his life and was a lesser standard work. “I said it is Isabella of Aragon with her sons and it is painted by da Vinci,” says Vogt-Lüerssen, pointing to an intricate laced pattern around the top of the woman’s head. “Are you sure? Yes, he has put his special sign right here, in the halo around her head where there are not stars or rays but his symbol, which was private. Leonardo has a special note, and if he puts it in then you know it is (a painting of) Leonardo, or he painted it. All his symbols are here but you don’t see Leonardo.”..."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 55 Historical research built on contemporary diarists and research of customs combined with family trees and the unlocking of family symbols has launched Vogt-Lüerssen into an area of art history that she believes has been poorly treated, if not overlooked. She is critical of the certainty with which so many portraits have been identified and believes many of them, particularly in Italy, are wrong. “I think historians have to read a lot and know everything,” she says. ”For example, if I say this is Isabella of Aragon, the Duchess of Milan, I have to prove that with contemporary written and picture sources. If they tell me, Maike, you are wrong, then I am wrong and I have to look for another theory but art historians are not doing that. They are not into the details of history. They look at paint strokes and so on, and the rest is interpretation for them.” She has written to the Louvre more than once but has never received a reply... She will also continue to hound the National Gallery of Art in Washington about a painting she claims was wrongly attributed to Cariani and sits unheralded and all but forgotten in their archives. The painting, Portrait of a Man with a Dog [opposite], according to Vogt-Lüerssen, is the only known self-portrait of the young Leonardo da Vinci. 16 Vogt-Lüerssen’s semiotic analyses and detailed historical researches have uncovered a wealth of information that has been completely overlooked by art historians and biographers, providing the framework for an accurate revision of the life of Leonardo da Vinci. While Vogt- Lüerssen’s corrected identification of the ‘Mona Lisa’ provides insight into the romantic life of Leonardo, her identification of a misattributed portrait of the young da Vinci reveals the face of an exceptionally talented pupil. Leonardo trained his artistic eye and careful hands as a student of Andrea del Verrocchio, among a group that would become known for using each other as life models for commissioned paintings depicting historical figures. This adherence to working directly from life rather than imagination allows an insider view into both the group dynamics and physical features of da Vinci and his close contemporaries. Vogt-Lüerssen has skillfully compared the works of these colleagues and their teacher, Verrocchio, who himself used Leonardo as a model for his sculpture ‘David’ (at left), which displays facial features that corroborate her other findings: In the course of my research for the book \"Who is Mona Lisa? In Search of Her Identity\" I investigated not only the coat of arms, specific symbols or emblems and colours used by the different Italian dynasties of the 15th and 16th century, but also the hundreds of books of plates in which one can find the wonderful portraits from this epoch. Because over 95% of these portraits are unsigned, undated and give no information about the person depicted, art historians will make mistakes (and have made mistakes) when attributing a portrait to a painter, year or subject. The new portrait of Leonardo da Vinci [opposite], which was painted between 1475 and 1480 and can be found in Washington, The National Gallery of Art, was wrongly attributed to the Italian painter Cariani († 1547), be- cause Cariani used the same kind of background for his portraits. Cariani probably knew this particular painting and was inspired by the great master, although his skill was not comparable to that of Leonardo da Vinci. The latter is in his self-portrait not only dressed like the people of that time (those who could afford it), we also know that he was very interested in the study of drapery in the 70s of the 15th century. So, in this portrait you see in the background not only a look out of the window, you also see a wall upon which a cloth is showing his great interest in the study of drapery. By the way, it probably was customary for the pupils of Andrea del Verrocchio to paint a self-portrait. We also have self-portraits of Pietro Perugino († 1523) and Lorenzo di Credi († 1537). In the paintings [of his teachers and contemporaries, and in the sculpted features of Verrocchio’s ‘David’, above]... you can see what Leonardo da Vinci looks like. These portraits were painted by Leonardo da Vinci’s master Andrea del Verrocchio († 1488), co-workers of his master like Botticelli († 1510) and Francesco Botticini († 1498), and his own friends and/or students. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 56 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 57 The drawing [of an old man, seen at left]... which is regarded to be a self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, is certainly not a portrait o f the great master. It depicts a man at the age of 70 to 75 years. Leonardo da Vinci didn’t have the fortune to reach this age. The drawing in fact depicts either Leonardo’s father Ser Piero da Vinci or his beloved uncle Francesco da Vinci, both of whom died at the age of around 80. Some art historians instead made the ridiculous assumption that Leonardo da Vinci must have aged very quickly. The contemporaries of the great master described his looks very precisely, but they didn’t mention this phenomenon. In the following book „Leonardo - des Meisters Gemälde und Zeich- nungen in 360 Abbil-dungen. Reihe: Klassiker der Kunst in Gesamtausgaben. 37. Bd. Stuttgart und Berlin 1931“ you find the remark (on page 398) that this portrait was definitely made at the beginning of the 90s of the 15th century. Leonardo was at that time not even 40 years old. The great painter made some further drawings of his father and/or his uncle Francesco... However, not only is the similarity of the person in Figure 1 with the other portraits of Leonardo striking, there is further indication that this person is the great master himself: The little white dog, which was either Leonardo’s dog or the dog of his master Andrea del Verrocchio († 1488). A little white dog can also be seen in the painting “Tobias and the angel”... which was made in the school of Andrea del Verrocchio. The dog in this painting was depicted by Leonardo da Vinci according to the art historian David Alan Brown (see his book: Leonardo da Vinci – Origin of a genius. New Haven and London 1998). This little dog can also be seen in the painting “Tobias and the three angels” of a co-worker of Andrea del Verrocchio, Francesco Botticini. The dog can be found on the left side of the Archangel Michael, who is nobody else than Leonardo da Vinci himself. Leonardo was said to have had a big heart for animals. His contemporaries described how he liked to go to the markets and buy little birds in tiny little cages. He then went outside of the cities to open their cages and give them back their freedom. In his household there were always a lot of dogs and cats to be found. There are numerous drawings made by the great master that show them jumping and rolling. Leonardo also avoided to eat meat, at least as an elderly man. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 58 When viewing the countryside through the window of this portrait painting, you can see the beautiful landscape of the Mugello with its hills and mountains. Not far in the distance you can discover the township of Fiesole. That is where the rich Florentine citizens, including one uncle of Leonardo da Vinci, had their summer houses, and where they spent the unbearably hot summer months. When Leonardo visited Florence, he often lived with his uncle. Nearby, on Monte Ceceri, he carried out his famous flight experiments. Could it be that this new portrait of Leonardo da Vinci is the same portrait mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in his famous book “Lives of seventy of the most eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects”, published in 1550, when he speaks about Francesco Melzi, the beloved pupil and heir of Leonardo da Vinci: “... (Francesco Melzi) a Milanese gentleman, who, in the time of Leonardo, was a child of remarkable beauty, much beloved by him, and is now a handsome and amiable old man, who sets great store by these drawings, and treasures them as relics, together with the portrait of Leonardo of blessed memory.” (in: Giorgio Vasari: Lives of seventy of the most eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, edited and annotated by E.H. and E.W. Blashfield and A.A. Hopkins. Vol. II. London 1897, S. 392) Addendum 1: All historical sources are telling us that Leonardo da Vinci painted his portraits, paintings and beautiful portrait drawings with the right hand. There is no indication that he was left-handed. However he was better with his left hand than the normal right-handed person. For example, Leonardo sometimes wrote his documents in mirror-writing with his left hand. But he never painted with his left hand! The main historical source for this fact is Antonio de' Beatis who was the secretary of the Cardinal Luigi d' Aragona and who paid with his master a visit to Leonardo da Vinci on 10th October 1517. Luckily for us historians he used to write down everything – really everything – in his diary: „On the 10th of October 1517, Monsignor (the Cardinal Luigi d'Aragona) and the rest of us went to see, in one of the outlying parts of Amboise, Messer Leonardo da Vinci the Florentine... the most eminent painter of our time, who showed to his Eminence the Cardinal three pictures; one of a certain Florentine lady (Pacificia Brandano or Isabella Gualanda) , painted from life, at the instance of the late Giuliano de' Medici; the other of the youthful St. John the Baptist; and the third of the Madonna and the Child in the lap of St. Anne, the most perfect of them all. One cannot indeed expect any more good work from him, as a certain paralysis has crippled his right hand. But he has a pupil, a Milanese, who works well enough. And although Messer Leonardo can no longer paint with the sweetness which was peculiar to him, he can still design and instruct others...“ (in: Ludwig Goldscheider: Leonardo da Vinci. London and New York 1944, p. 20). 17 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 59 A comparison of the rediscovered self-portrait by the young Leonardo da Vinci with the 1892 portrai t photograph of Nikola Tesla presents striking similarities, with differing eyebrow forms framing their lively eyes. These two prolific inventors inspired by the ‘wheelworks’ of nature were both described as animal lovers who were known for vegetarianism in their later years of live. Both inventors were patronized by aristocrats and produced designs for war machines despite their overriding pacifism. Interestingly, Nikola was so hungry for invention at a young age that he rejected draftsmanship, stating in his autobiography: “freehand drawing... was an annoyance I could not endure... Perhaps my aversion was simply due to the predilection I found in undisturbed thought” 18 reflecting a preference for invention over artistic pursuit. The great body of works of Tesla and da Vinci have so thoroughly directed modern technology and so greatly fascinated the world’s historians and biographers that a false mythology has become entrenched within academic circles, effectively confusing the public perception of their extraordinary creative legacy: Let Leonardo da Vinci be a warning to all celebrities like politicians, actors, singers, artists and members of royal or other noble houses. If they will not share their private lives with the public, their future biographers or some art historians and last not least some psychoanalysts will fill the empty pages with their own ideas and fantasies. Of course at first there will always be some contemporaries who will defend them but after a while the lies will eventually be accepted as the truth. It becomes possible for their portraits to be confused with those of their parents, as happened with Leonardo da Vinci and his father or uncle, and they may even be described as paedophiles, as also happened with Leonardo! Now back to the great artist. When will the historians look for traces of Leonardo’s real life in the 15 th and 16 th centuries? When will the nonsense stop that so-called experts are telling about him again and again, for which they can’t offer one single historical source? When will the identity of “Mona Lisa” be recognised as the Milanese Duchess Isabella of Aragon, because she is the key of Leonardo’s private life? This riddle, for instance, is easy to solve. You only have to learn the symbols and the emblems of the Milanese dynasty of the Visconti and Sforza, which you can find in my book \"Bianca Maria Visconti: The Mother of the Sforza\" (in German). These devices will lead you to one of the greatest love stories of the Renaissance. 19 "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 60 The reattribution of the ‘Portrait of Man with a Dog’ as a self-portrait of the young Leonardo is strongly corroborated by another major find in southern Italy which provides insight into his appearance in the later years of life. An intriguing discovery by art historians in 2009 has sparked academic debate regarding a damaged self-portrait that may also be the masterwork of da Vinci. Depicting a longhaired, bearded man in his fifties, the self-portrait is likely to have been rendered circa 1508. The iconic Acerenza portrait is quite likely the original work that inspired a multitude of copies that depict the bearded Leonardo in this same feathered hat and from the same perspective. The most significant evidence that affirms this crucial reattribution is the discovery of a subtle script on the backside of the canvas – written in reverse : An Italian historian claims to have discovered a previously unknown portrait of Leonardo da Vinci. The oil painting was discovered by Nicola Barbatelli, a medieval historian, while he was studying the picture collection of a family in Acerenza in southern Italy. While it was previously thought to portray the astronomer Galileo Galilei, Mr. Barbatelli claims that the picture represents the Renaissance genius in middle age. Mr. Barbatelli said that the picture, which measures 24 inches by 17 inches, could be a self-portrait because it bears one of the artist's trademarks on the back: the words \"pinxit mea\" are written in reverse... While the authenticity of the picture is yet to be confirmed by experts, da Vinci is believed to have visited the region. The Acerenza portrait also resembles a figure in Raphael's School of Athens in the Vatican which is also thought to represent da Vinci. 20 The newly recognized self-portrait is marred by years of disregard in unsuitable storage conditions, during which time the painting was damaged by two deep gouges across the face. A digital restoration of the Acerenza self-portrait by this author provides a clearer view of the facial features of Leonardo da Vinci in his middle years (p. 61). The rediscovered Acerenza self-portrait by Leonardo shows strong consistencies with the facial features observed in his other recently rediscovered self-portrait as a youthful student. Taken together, the two images establish solid documentation of Leonardo’s physical appearance, overturning mistaken assumptions repeatedly asserted by generations of art historians. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 61 "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 62 Da Vinci’s thoughtful gaze seems very attentive in the earlier self-portrait with long brown hair, while in the later work his long grey-brown hair, flowing beard and sharp eyes give the appearance of aged discernment. The physical appearance of Leonardo remained obscured for hundreds of years after his death, until the nearly simultaneous rediscovery of not one, but two of his lost self-portraits bearing a clear resemblance to the da Vinci portrait by apprentice Francesco Melzi (p. 58). The close timing of the rediscovery of both of these lost self-portraits being reported exactly during my past life research efforts is, in itself, a profound gift of synchronicity. Equally intriguing is the existence of very good comparative photographs of Nikola Tesla from the same respective age periods as the Leonardo portraits, and taken from close to the same viewpoint. These features afford a rare opportunity to examine the many similarities between the two articulate inventors. The da Vinci self-portrait with feathered cap, of perhaps 1508 (opposite), presents a set of sharp facial characteristics also observed in a photograph of Nikola Tesla taken in 1900 (at left). The height and build of both inventors are also comparable, as are their writing styles. Outstanding collaborative research by dedicated scientists and art historians over the last decade has brought together a broad range of forensic scientific evidence of the actual life of Leonardo, by creating databases of partial fingerprints, rediscovering long hidden frescoes 21 and identifying misattributed drawings. 22 One group of researchers has deduced the long-forgotten location of da Vinci’s workshop at the Florentine friary of the Santissima Annunziata beginning in 1500, with the remains of several frescoes from that time period likely painted by Leonardo and his assistants. 23 Another group has reconstructed the fingerprint of da Vinci by piecing together fragmentary smudges from his left forefinger. 24 The print’s central whorl suggests an Arabic ancestral link, leading to rational speculation that his mother may not have been a peasant girl but instead a slave of middle-eastern origin who was married off to a worker by Ser Piero after Leonardo’s birth. This well explains why his mother’s identity remains unknown. Having recognized that “water is the driving force of all nature,” Leonardo’s experimentation with winged flight was developed into a mastery of antigravity using water plasma during the subsequent life’s work of Nikola Tesla. Tesla’s secret transdimensional spacecraft designs employed HHO plasma, derived from water, to achieve optical invisibility and electromagnetic propulsion controlled by standing waves. Water is represented astrologically by the zodiacal sign of Aquarius, the New Age to begin precisely on the day of December 22, 2012. The power of water itself will be visible in the skies, as humanity learns to use the light of HHO plasmas generated from colloidal gold and silver sacred waters as a source of physical rejuvenation, free energy and cosmic propulsion. The ignition of HHO gas induces the implosion of hydrogen atoms as HHO plasma. This occurs as atmospheric luminous flashes when water vapor is ignited along infrasound standing waves, as witnessed in the ecstatic realizations of Tesla and myself. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 63 These quantum resonance maps were produced in much the same way as Leonardo sought through his studies of spherical geometry, and provide a new geographical framework for discerning alignment within the bands of infrasound resonance at the birthplaces of individuals based on their distance from the pyramids of Giza, Egypt. Vinci, Italy (43.78°N 10.92°E) is 1,462 miles from Giza, or 5.87% of the Earth’s mean circumference. Da Vinci’s birthplace is situated along the resonant radial distance located between the 5.27% and 6.6% resonant distances from the Great Pyramid. As mentioned earlier, Nikola Tesla was born precisely on the 6.6% resonant distance alignment, at the same radial distance as the Vatican, in a band of infrasound resonance that may soon require evacuation due to continual spates of electric fires. The rapid and ongoing changes of the new Aquarian Age present fascinating opportunities for the advancement of human spirituality in synchrony with the natural shift of energy to a higher quantum state. A key tool in mitigating the impact of the extreme solar activity anticipated during the magnetic reversal event of 2012 will be an awareness of the locations of resonant focal points of standing infrasound waves. The rapidly intensifying ultra-low frequency resonance of the planet is igniting electrical systems in many parts of the world and has quickly become a hazard to the International Space Station, which continues operation at extreme risk to stationed astronauts. AC current technology must be abandoned for safety. The naturally unfolding geomagnetic and psychoacoustic changes are synchronizing the collective human memory of previous lives. Plasma orbs are among the higher dimensional forces weaving crop circles among us, tantalizing the curious minds of humanity. The orbs provide glances of the intense changes to come, when an enveloping canopy of resonant HHO plasma in Earth’s atmosphere will rebalance and enhance the frequencies of light received on the surface, inducing DNA augmentation, enhanced longevity and synesthetic consciousness among human beings."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 64 A profoundly blissful sense of recognition, synchronicity and excitement flooded my consciousness upon seeing the largest crop formation yet to grace Earth’s fields in modern times. Reported on August 7, 2009 just on the outskirts of Goes, Netherlands, the vast scale of this intricate mandala formation dwarfs all previously documented formations. 25 Extending a remarkable 1,740 x 1,480 feet, this pattern in downed wheat spans the entire field, which lies adjacent to a stream feeding the aquifer below. Proximity to underground water is a common factor identified in crop circle research conducted all over the world, and also references the transdimensional capacity of water within the human body, which comprises 77% of its weight. The winged human figure is depicted with four arms and four legs, directly corresponding to da Vinci’s ‘Proportions of Man’, which encodes the golden ratio – a defining feature of crop formations. Among many cultures of the world the butterfly symbolizes the cyclical transformation of human consciousness. The Mesoamerican Maya and Aztec civilizations associated the butterfly with the God of cosmic fire, Xiutecutli; fire being another transformative element that burns away old patterns of growth to make way for the renewal of life. Continual references to the sophisticated spiritual concepts of the Maya have been noted in dozens of complex formations. The butterfly also represents a catalyst for change in a modern scientific metaphor, ‘the butterfly effect’, which posits that quantum shifts in weather patterns or other macro-systems are affected by micro-influences like the mere flapping of a butterfly’s wings."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 65 Complete corporate media censorship of this spectacular Goes crop formation reflects corporate fear of the pattern’s powerful transformative effect on human consciousness. Meanwhile another arm of the concerted media disinformation campaign has absurdly proclaimed the gigantic butterfly formation as its own handiwork, allegedly completed in a single night. Crop formations created by human artists are quite easily discerned by careful examination of the downed stalks, yet this well-orchestrated media blackout has effectively prevented researchers from becoming aware of the formation in time to collect this definitive evidence. The only rational conclusion one can draw is that this crucial data in the wheat stalks themselves is being withheld from public awareness to support the false claims of its manmade origin. This spellbinding crop formation delivers a powerful message far beyond the creative capacity of human hands, and expresses a wealth of meaning that directly references the Fibonacci structure of standing waves that I have defined as the exact formula hidden by da Vinci in his drawing ‘The Proportions of Man’ (p. 51-52). The upper arcs of the butterfly’s wings match the specific contour and actual scale of infrasound standing waves, while the figure’s antennae symbolize the human heart’s reception of infrasound standing waves as the catalyst for the present transformation of human consciousness. All of the arcs that form the contours of the butterfly’s wings converge directly on the figure’s heart chakra! The location of the da Vinci butterfly crop formation in Goes, Netherlands (51.516°N 3.847°E – in white, above) is 2,038 miles from Giza, or 8.18% of the Earth’s mean circumference. This particular site also affirms my infrasound standing wave global map (above) based on the quadratic formula [ z n+1 = z n 2 ]. I could not imagine a greater confirmation of the research conclusions shared in this book, which was nearing completion during the formation of the da Vinci butterfly glyph. Not only have I been blessed with a plethora of information about the real life of Leonardo da Vinci coming to light precisely during the writing of this book, but also a most direct confirmation of my complete theory of Magnetic Resonance presented on a cosmic scale, and linked to insights obtained from my past life as Leonardo da Vinci."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 66 References   1 Marinoni A (1974) ‘The Writer: Leonardo’s Literary Legacy’ in Ladislao Reti, editor, The Unknown Leonardo , Abradale Press, New York, p.70 2 Gugg C, Healy T, Maier-Paape HK, Maier-Paape S (2000) ‘Nonlinear Standing and Rotating Waves on the Sphere’ Journal of Differential Equations 166, pp. 402-442, online · http://mr-fusion.hellblazer.com/pdfs/spherical_nonlinear_waves.pdf 3 Jadczyk A (2002) Jadczyk A (2003) ‘On Quantum Iterated Function Systems’ IFT University of Wroclaw internal report, online · http://quantumfuture.net/quantum_future/papers/qifs.htm 4 Bourke P (1990) ‘Circle Squares Fractal’ University of Western Australia , online · http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/fractals/circlesquares/ 5 Putney A (2008) ‘ Ø ’ HumanResonance, Lulu Press, Berkeley, California 6 Mauritsson J, Johnsson P, Mansten E, Swoboda M, Ruchon T, L’Huillier A, Schafer KJ (2008) ‘Coherent Electron Scattering Captured by an Attosecond Quantum Stroboscope’ Physical Review Letters 100, 073003, online · http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/ 7 Tesla N (1978) ‘Nikola Tesla: Colorado Springs Notes 1899-1900’ Nolit, Beograd, Yugoslavia, pp. 61- 62 8 Tesla N (1907) ‘Tuned Lightening’ English Mechanic and World of Science – March 8, p. 108 9 Putney A (2006) ‘Satellite Records Atmospheric Anomaly’ HumanResonance , online · http://www.humanresonance.org/sphere.html 10 Cervenka M, Bednarik M and Konicek P (2003) ‘Nonlinear Standing Waves in Acoustic Resonators with Arbitrary Reflection Coefficients at Their Walls’ Czech Technical University, Prague, online · http://www.sfa.asso.fr/wcu2003/procs/website/articles/000122.pdf 11 -- (2009) ‘ Geometrical Construction of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci’ World-Mysteries , online · http://www.world-mysteries.com/sci_17_vm.htm 12 -- (2009) ‘Geometry of Leonardo Da Vinci’ Atrise Golden Section Software , online · http://www.atrise.com/golden-section/scr16.jpg 13 Payne R (1979) ‘ Leonardo ’ Robert Hale, Ltd, London, pp. 137 -149 14 Vogt-Lüerssen M (2003) ‘ Wer ist Mona Lisa? ’ Books on Demand, Norderstedt, Germany 15 Holt R (2007) ‘Solved: Why the Mona Lisa Doesn’t Have Eyebrows’ Telegraph , online · http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3668700/Solved-Why-Mona-Lisa-doesnt- have-eyebrows.html 16 Debelle P (2008) ‘The Art Detective’ Adelaide Review , online · http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives.php 17 Vogt-Lüerssen M (2007) ‘Discovery of a New Self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci!’ Kleio , online · http://www.kleio.org/en/history/leonardo/newportrait.html 18 Tesla N (1982) ‘My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla’ Hart Brothers, Vermont, p. 51 19 Vogt-Lüerssen M (2008) ‘Leonardo as a Victim of Rumors’ Kleio , online · http://www.kleio.org/en/history/leonardo/index.html 20 -- (2009) ‘Leonardo da Vinci Portrait Discovered’ Telegraph , online · http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/4787368/Leonardo- da-Vinci-portrait-discovered.html 21 Lorenzi R (2005) ‘Lost da Vinci Treasure Hidden Behind Wall?’ Discovery News , June 17, online · http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/06/17/1394507.htm 22 Gilles R (2009) ‘Art Experts Find Possible New Leonardo Drawing’ AP News , October 14, online · http://www.toledoonthemove.com/entertainment/story.aspx?list=196620&id=362979 23 Lorenzi R (2005) ‘Da Vinci’s Secret Workroom Located’ Discovery News , January 21, online · http://www.discovery-channel.com/news/briefs/20050117/leonardo.html 24 Lorenzi R (2006) ‘Da Vinci Fingerprint Reveals Arab Heritage?’ Discovery Ne ws , October 28, online · http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/10/28/leonardoprint_his.html 25 -- (2009) ‘The Butterfly Crop Circle, Netherlands’ MayanProphecy2012 , online · http://mayanprophecy2012.blogspot.com/2009/09/butterfly-crop-circle-netherlands.html "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 4 Aura Reading"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 68 Aura Reading for Alexander Putney by Laura Peppard on March 19, 2008 The aura reading was conducted in Nevada at the Reno Psychic Institute, founded by Laura Peppard. While Laura knew nothing of Alex’s research, she understood the reading was sought as a form of past life release therapy for his present emotional distress. This 2hr tape-recorded session has been subsequently transcribed and edited for publication: Laura: May it be with the blessings of the Supreme Being that this reading for Alex Putney is in the highest and best good for him on his path and those that are with us, and for all of our growth and understanding. State your name for us. Alex: Alexander Russell Putney. So, I’m going to go through my regular routine, and then I will just start hitting things. The first thing I do is make a rose and let your energy fill it. Your rose is like a pink, like of flesh color. It appears, like, a little grainy maybe, the color. It’s bent at the stem, right under the blossom. No w, that’s interesting. And then the stem goes off to the side like that [gesturing horizontally]. I’ll explain these symbols. The rose is you –how open you are to your own information, your abilities. The stem is your past, your history on this planet –how your whole past is working towards where you are. So, the stem is really in a very unusual situation there. I’d say as well as the color of the rose. The rose seems to be, maybe using the word ‘frozen’ is not quite right, but it’s not blooming outward. It’s like, real stiff. The stem is real healthy, but it’s bent, and it looks like it’s blowing in the wind even though it’s very long, which would indicate a lot of lives on this planet. My overall impression here, is of some group of beings that are, kind of, present here for some reason or another, and they’re not letting themselves be known, evidently... and you kind of work for them, you know. Are you aware of that yourself, or...? Alex: Yes. [Laughing.] This is great imagery, I just can’t see where you are here, because that whole stem is waving in the wind, but then the rose and the top inch of stem –that’s real green, like someone else is holding it there, because otherwise that wind would be blowing the whole thing away. And the sun above your head, which is like a connection to your path, is, um... there’s something going on there that’s different, too. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 69 It’s like an eclipse of the sun, it’s not like the sun is shining, but it is directly overhead, which would indicate you are on your path. Either that, or, it’s like somebody’s putting the picture in front of me to show me that. That’s what they want me to see. And I look at these two clocks –the one for you as a body personality is at 4 o’clock, which would indicate you’re just beginning to explore your own information. You’re kind of in the middle of that. On a being level, on an entity level, I see the clock more at –it looks like 8 o’clock. So, you’re finishing up a cycle of creating from your own information. You’re in two different places like that, two different stages of growth. Have you had, like, uh... any alien type experiences? A: No physical interactions [that I am aware of], only through consciousness. Normally, at this point, I would look on the stem for past lives that are affecting you at the present time, and there’s a white, very fuzzy area there at the top of the stem. When I look at that is feels like, um, I don’t know, it’s like this “spaceship landing” kind of thing... Now I definitely see a being over here [beside you]. It’s kind of a golden mustard color, and it’s, like, reaching its arms around you, to draw you to it, or enfold you in itself... kind of like you’re a prize or something. Okay, so, Alex, let’s switch now we’re going to look at your aura and your chakras. So, first chakra, which is your survival information, and then that goes into the layer closest to your body also. That layer, the first thing I notice is [that it is] very close to your body and there’s not much width to it, there’s not a lot of energy going through it. It’s almost like your own survival space is, you know, on hold, or... not an issue somehow. Can I just ask what kind of decisions that your parents are not at ease with you making? A: Ascetic choices."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 70 Uh -huh. Do you, like, meditate a lot, or...? A: Yes, and I am choosing to separate myself from the confusion I feel around me. Well that corresponds to this layer, which is not... -it’s empty. No, I have seen empty before, it’s not exactly that, it’s uh... Not a lot of energy in it, not a lot of movement, kind of on hold, I guess. The [first] chakra actually has some of that gold color in it too, like this being [enfolding you in its arms]... My take on that would be, that whoever this is –and we still haven’t looked at that yet– you know, trying to take a stab at that... so I’m not really going to make a judgment on that level, but I’m seeing that same energy in that first chakra. So its kind of like that being is running your body, or, um, like you’re not having to worry about survival because it’s somehow feeding this energy into you... you know, a sense of that. And so there’s no grounding too, because of that. So I’m seeing that energy, kind of from the top of the chakra to, you know, 5-6” down and then the bottom part of it is looking to me like black, which would mean that your energy isn’t there, and normally that charka would go off into a grounding cord where you would connect with the planet. Its almost like you’re on the planet, but not of the planet . Kind of, like, hovering above it... Looking at that second chakra, at the abdomen there... it looks like the green is coming in front, kind of swirling around, and behind that the chakra itself is, um, kind of in a state of potentiality. So, like it or not, you do have a lot of normal feelings, but you’re... I’m seeing it circling around like this, and then its, you’re not really turning it back in on yourself... its like a placeholder, I guess. That’s the, like, normal, young man – assert yourself, and that kind of sex drive with it too... going outward. It’s not a problem, but it will have some consequence... Now the third chakra, that’s in the solar plexus, that’s about creating in the physical world, about how you run your energy... [After some hesitation:] Well, you just want me to be honest about what I see, right? It’s like a machine or a black box behind the chakra, and on this side of it. I’m not going to pretend to know what it is at this point, but if I get some insight into it I’ll let you know [laughter]. And then, in that layer, it’s, um, the layer is wid e –it’s not like the first layer that’s real narrow, but the energy in it is kind of like dark swirls. A feeling of like being lost or of wandering, or of no purpose maybe -kind of brown, black, smoky. And when I look behind that – you can look behind an energy to see what’s coming next, or what the person wants for themselves, you know, and I just got a real quick glimpse of you turning away... [More hesitation] Okay, here’s crazy time. When I look at that black box, what I see are like, um, clones. Maybe not exactly like you, but definitely like you... or, you know –clone is my conclusion, but what I’m seeing is like, little figures coming out this box, as I described. And that is kind of like, you don’t have to do something, because in some sense, maybe your genetic [field] –I’m postulating here– is doing some- thing... through some other process than you doing something. Does that make any sense to you at all? A: I’ve always had the feeling that something is invisibly going on around me... of importance. Anyway, when I try to look at that black box, that’s what information comes. Okay, so those are the body chakras, then if we go up to the fourth chakra, that’s very, um, let’s see... it’s a different feeling than these [lower charkas] –quite energized in a gentle, buzzy way. As far as colors, there’s definitely green and a black, a little bit, and then I see an orange that has like, kind of a spot. It’s your color, you’re producing it, and it’s about healing... Now I’m getting a picture like this [raises both arms above her head], sort of stylized. So your arms are not employed in doing something in this world. They’re golden, and I see them holding... a generator, or something that’s arching in a spiral ... And it has to do with balancing male and female energy; it’s actually arching the connection. It’s kind of interesting, because you’re completing the circuit in yourself . There’s a feeling of, like, wanting to be able to play. Either you didn’t play when you were a child, or you remembered how that felt and you want to find it again. Only it’s for a purpose... well, a child when they play can have a purpose too, but there’s a great purpose or a present-time purpose."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 71 Okay, that’s funny, now I’m seeing, like, newspapers. Kind of like if you held the spine of newspapers going back in time [makes a sound of flipping pages]. It’s like you can stop at different pictures... on this page I’m seeing you in a top hat and [with a] cane, kind of a young man, like you are now, with your arm around a girl, and you’re looking quite, um, engaged, you know... quite, like, you really believe in who you are. And the woman is beautiful, she has on this burgundy satin and she’s sad. She’s kind of acting outwardly normal, but she’s sad, like she’s knows she’s going to die, or something like that... I mean, she doesn’t know it mentally but she knows it, her spirit. And I’m kind of seeing, like, at the end of that life that it happened and you were... you lost it, kind of crazy, alone, and... drunk... trying to live through what happened. I think I feel okay to bring that into the present time to release some of that [past life anxiety]. Now, what I’m getting is... that being from that life that was the child that died or whatever happened, wants to have a contract with you in this life... There is no contract indicated –contracts are children– but it wants to make a contract with you. So, that’s your free will. But you weren’t recognizing that, so that’s why it was stuck in this unconscious space, and now you’ll have to say “I do” or “I don’t” [agree to make a spirit contract to father this being as your own child]. Yeah, so you were talking about experiencing past lives, or something about that, because I can see that your whole history is an open newspaper. It’s kind of like whatever issue you decide to stop at, then you go into that whole reality. Would that describe that [situation accurately]?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 72 A: I’m seeing past life images, many in black and white... I can go back and forth to put the pieces together as I choose. There’s another present here that you’re working to find [brief pause]. Like maybe you could say it’s the Lord of Karma, is one sense I get from it. In another sense, I’m not quite sure that that whole thing in newspapers is yours. I’m not positive of that. Or, okay, here’s another thing, because then I’m like, okay, here’s this little thing that looks like –well, that’s a wormhole. It’s like if I look through it, then it comes up, maybe let’s say on another planet, I don’t know, another place, and there’s somebody else reading these past live s –accessing your information, say. So, now my conclusion is that they’re probably your past lives, but that somebody else is reading them, you know, like we would watch TV. Or, those experiences are available, so, you’re like an open book... A: [More laughter] Yes, I feel that’s happening, but I am slowly having a more natural access to my own past and future. I can navigate. I don’t feel out of control. I’m able to choose what I want to look into. Is this the part about your future things? Does that happen too, or...? What kind of things do you see? Cataclysmic type things? A: I hear these deep, resonating sounds and the bodies in temples being cleansed with the red light."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 73 Well, you didn’t warn me about this. [Laughter] Yeah. [More laughter] Is this kind of a recent thing, or something in his childhood? Well, you’re you, obviously, but is it more like a starting date, or a point in time? Or just more, kind of... you’re involved? A: There’s definitely a calendar connection to it, of course, and it’s been progressing for many years... it was always very much inside, focusing on patterns in nature... I spent several months alone in the Atacama Desert that initiated some major changes in my perspective. Are you getting, kind of like, isolated, or...? A: In a way. I think I’m moving closer to a lot of things that are important to me. It’s almost like a drastic change that will settle into a new pattern when the time comes. I don’t feel isolated at all, but expectant. Well, you definitely are showing me this orange in your heart. That’s changed. Can you feel that in your heart chakra? That’s something you want to generate for yourself. Then, actually when I look into it there’s white in the center, and then there’s all these, um... uh... geometric kaleidoscope generator . I don’t know what else to say. There are all these geometric images emitting from it. You know, it’s kind of like, each one is different but all true to the source of it somehow. So when something is geometric like that, to me that indicates a high vibration source... The orange is self-healing. This looks like a new form of communication, or connection, that you have for yourself in place. It has to do with construction and deconstruction, so these geometric patterns are like templates. Like, you know, they interact with something. Or something connects with them on that level and can access your template. I don’t know if that’s DNA or what... But then, because you have access to that, and with the agreement of the object or person, you know, that you’re connecting with – [you could] actually be able to alter that template. And I’m getting the sense that it’s not like something you do to someone else, but it’s, like, something that is grooving there, now that you have access to the templates."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 74 And in that fourth layer, the heart layer... you’re gentle here, you must have been a gentle child. Maybe ‘gentle’ is not the right word. Language fails us in this. I keep wanting to use the word ‘magnanimous’, but I don’t think it applies... Receptive more than outgoing. You know, something coming to you, more than “I want this”, or “I love this.” So, in this way about your nature, I might, kind of suggest, you know, it’s not so much about you attracting to you something from the world. It’s about placing you somewhere and then you’ll deal quite well in that situation... A: I’ve been moving around the world a lot my whole life, seeking that path for a long time now. Uh -huh. There might be this international connection like how your father is, but I’m not quite sure if that’s his picture or whether that’s, like, in the role that you will have together. Fifth chakra? I see a blotch of red, a blotch of gray, then some green and orange, and blue. So, it’s kind of, not formative, you know –there’s no structure to those images– quite opposite to these things here [at the heart chakra]. You might have to say, maybe ‘unutilized’, or not really connected to your mode of communication, so much at the present time. So, like you say, what’s necessary, or what you need to in different situations, but you’re not really communicating, you know, from who you are, interactively. Does that sound right? A: Yes, I’m seeking other kinds of interactions right now [-of the non-verbal, telepathic kind]. So, the red is kind of like, in the area where that is painful to you, and the gray is like “this isn’t making sense to me” kind of feeling. Green and orange are like a team for change and healing. You know maybe 40% - the gray/reds, maybe 40% in that red/blue... is your own information that’s in play, so sometimes you will come out with something quite useful, or something profound in terms of who you’re interacting with. I’m kind of not feeling really happy about that chakra, just in terms of – where are you? You know, where are you? Where’s your passion? What do you do? I don’t see that. I just see these things are, kind of like, in play. That layer cloaks the fourth in this dynamic of the aura. So, that fourth layer, you know, I felt really good about that. I could feel you there –kind of an advanced soul, in the way that you have affinity, I would describe it. And then that fifth layer, which is communication, is like, I wouldn’t say a shadow, but kind of a cloak over it, but not like dark or suffocating. It’s like a transparent cloak or something. So, it’s kind of keeping that fourth layer from being more, um... You know, normally whatever energy you run in your space that’s creating consequences in the world, and you’re getting those consequences and learning and growing from it, and that’s generally how people change and grow. This is in a sense not letting that happen, as I see in the layers. Kind of more like you’re on a mountaintop, or protected? I’m feeling another presence in this layer too... Somebody else’s energy is there –jealous of your ability, but I don’t think necessarily a physical person [ here on this planet ]. A: Is this being generating a field of energy? Negativity? This specific energy which I’m on now, and I’m not applying that to the whole thing, but... You know, I’m just getting these weird things I don’t usually see in readings, but it’s kind of like this person... feels like a boy, kind of a thing... but a peer. It’s like taking your communication, but like, to another planet and using it, but it’s yours. But... he’s presenting it as his. You know, taking it from you, but it’s not in this world... [The energy of this being–] it’s smoky and goopy at the same time, and it’s kind of gray and mustard, too. So, I’m kind of assuming that this being is part of this group that you’re either working with, or they’re kind of holding you hostage –we haven’t arrived at that conclusion yet... So... you know this template thing I was describing on a heart level –yeah... as a being, you’re, like a tinkerer... –energetic, mechanical. I’m seeing that working in the same way as in your heart chakra in your out- of-body space. [A broad smile creeps over Alex’s face.] What? [Laughter.] What? Are you laughing at me? [More laughter.]"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 75 A: [Still smiling uncontrollably.] No, not at you (but at this funny situation you are accurately describing). The sixth chakra [also known as the third-eye] is kind of like a black cone, is the image I’m getting. And it’s kind of like, rejective, in a sense. So, it’s like telling the world to “back off”. Normally this chakra is ab out seeing images, vision and it’s like you’re refraining from making visions or pictures... Let’s say a hematite unicorn horn, a short one. That’s how that chakra looks to me. A: Is that a blockage, or a choice I’ve made? It’s designed to either hide, give you privacy, or not let the world see what you’re doing behind there, or what’s behind there. Which works pretty good, because when I go look and see, it’s hard to do that. [It’s] something I have to overcome. Okay, well I’m not just making this stuff up. I see, kind of like, hallways and beings with robes walking through them, holding something. I wouldn’t say an offering, but something kind of like this [gestures with two hands cupping a round container of some kind]. It’s almost like they’re in a labyrinth of some construction –of different hallways or something like that. I see red velvet, pink... In the crown chakra, there’s some green there... and then there’s a funnel, almost to a point. I see a funnel, but like this way [gestures to show it open above and narrowing to a point below]. And there’s a tremendous amount of information or energy in that cone, or funnel. But it’s not really interacting with your space, but yet it’s putting your growth, kind of, on hold. Like you’re not getting any growth out, even though you’re holding that in your space... Now, either you have a group of beings or aliens that have pretty much commandeered your space because you’re pretty capable, and you are running it, or you have some soul agreement with the group. You know, I don’t really see your growth or your empowerment in this agreement, but it might be, you know, not a place where I can understand adequately – [which might explain] why I arrive at that [idea]. A lot of the levels of information seem very profound and... of a high vibration."}]
