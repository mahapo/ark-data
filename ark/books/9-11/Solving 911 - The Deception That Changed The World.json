[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Solving 9 - 11: The Deception That Changed The World Christopher Bollyn "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Foreword by Glen Stanish Truth Marches On By Glen Stanish September 11, 2001, much like December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy. The post 9 - 11 period is one of the saddest times in American history. It has, however, provided the American people a slow and painful awakening of sorts. As an airline pilot for American Airlines, the attacks of 9 - 11 hit very close to home. I was in the middle of a four - day trip on a layover in downtown Fort Worth on 9 - 11. Like many Americans that day, I w oke up to the news of the devastating attacks. And, like most Americans, for a brief period after the attacks I was in a state of shock and awe. Very shortly after the attacks we were informed by our elected leaders and the media that we had been atta cked by Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida because they didn‘t like our freedoms. Simple enough, but lacking a plausible political motive. For those who think a bit further than what we‘re told and deeper about the causes of war - greed in a word - this explanat ion was hard to accept. It was as if President George W. Bush had given us a square peg, and no matter how hard we tried, we could not make it fit into the proverbial round hole. I suspect that the author of this book, Christopher Bollyn, may have experien ced this same thought process. My own personal discovery of the truth of 9 - 11 began with Bollyn. I had been subscribing to a newspaper, American Free Press , where he had been a regular contributing reporter. I had enjoyed reading Bollyn‘s articles, apprec iating his thorough research and open and honest candor. It was shortly after 9 - 11, when I was reading one of Bollyn‘s articles about the scene of the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. He described how many eyewitnesses, incl uding the mayor of Shanksville, reported never seeing any wreckage of a Boeing 757, saying things like there was no smoke or fire, no pieces of airframe, things along these lines. Other reports that quoted the coroner on the scene said there were no bodies or body parts. While reading these reports, I could not reconcile them with the usual scenes of airline accidents. As an airline pilot, we have been required for several years by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to complete, during our initial and annual training, a course called Crew Resource Management (C.R.M.). This is the study of airline accidents and incidents and what we as flight crew members could have done differently to have prevented a particular accident. This study of airline acci dents typically involves reviewing cockpit and air traffic control recordings, flight data recordings, and the well recorded and documented scenes of the accidents. So I have studied many airline accidents over the course of my career. It was difficult fo r me to accept the reports from Shanksville about the lack of any wreckage of Flight 93 because after an airline accident, large pieces of the aircraft are normally found. There"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com are the remains of the virtually indestructible engine cores, landing gear, a nd tail sections, to name just a few of the larger parts that would be found in the debris field. Other wreckage that one would normally expect to find from a well constructed Boeing 757 airframe would be several of the plug type entry and service doors, c argo doors, over wing exits, sections of fuselage and passenger seats, hydraulic tanks and pumps, and flight controls such as spoiler panels, flaps, slats, rudders, and elevators. Wreckage from inside the cabin that would have survived would include the em ergency exit slides, the emergency inflatable rafts, life preserver jackets, and other emergency equipment, galley carts, lavatories, coffee pots, ovens, in - flight magazines, and catalogues. Luggage, freight, and mail would also be recovered from the immed iate vicinity. These are the things eyewitnesses and first responders normally observe after a Boeing 757 collides with terrain. Temporary morgues are usually set up in nearby facilities where recovered bodies and body parts are taken and identified for t he families of the deceased. Therefore, soon after reading his article, and experiencing the difficulty of reconciling these reports with my experience and background, I contacted Bollyn and thus began my personal friendship with the author. Bollyn ha s continued to report breakthrough material and information about the inadequacies and the erroneous and deceptive nature of the official 9 - 11 reports. He has bravely pressed forward with determination, working with scientists and physics professors and ot her qualified professionals to show that the three World Trade Center buildings that collapsed on 9 - 11 were brought down by explosives in controlled demolitions. He has enlightened many to the intrigues of ―false flag‖ operations used as pretexts for war b y powerful, corrupt, and covetous politicians and bloodthirsty heads of state. This he has done in the face of heavy resistance by those who would attempt to keep the American people in the dark, namely the mainstream press and other special interest gro ups. But like a small candle in a large dark room, the light shines through. The 9 - 11 truth movement, as it is known, owes much to the work of Bollyn. Since his first writings about the subject, virtually thousands of scientists, professors, architect s, engineers, pilots, politicians, firefighters, religious leaders, lawyers, and others with expertise and qualifications have organized to have their voices heard and refute the official explanation of the attacks of 9 - 11. These are our attempts to petit ion the government for a redress of grievances, as it were. Yet some still ask, why would the U.S. government either attack its own people or cover up for those who attacked us on 9 - 11? And this is where some of Bollyn‘s most important work leads. To answer difficult questions like these, observers of history and geopolitics should consider the policies that have shifted, been postponed, cancelled, changed course, or otherwise bent as a result of the attacks of 9 - 11. And as most observers will attest, there was and still is an ongoing and unresolved major political issue in the Middle East, one whose developments have been very much affected by 9 - 11 and one that apparently has our own U.S. political house divided, or at least unable to clearly define an d implement its policies concerning this issue. And this unresolved political issue is the establishment of an independent and democratic Palestinian state, to co - exist with Israel with peace and justice for all. So what is our national policy concern ing the establishment of an independent and democratic"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Palestinian state? Is it fluid, undefined, and changing course over time with other changes in the political landscape? Or, is it solid, stable, and complete, just waiting for the ideal time to be im plemented? Or, perhaps, like other major international political issues (Iran Contra comes to mind) -- is there more than one policy? Is there one policy presented to the public, which never seems to progress towards completion, and another, planned behi nd closed doors, that develops in opposition to and in defiance of the stated public policy? As former President Jimmy Carter wrote in his book Palestine Peace Not Apartheid : The unwavering official policy of the United States since Israel became a state has been that its borders, unless modified through negotiations, must coincide with the armistice lines prevailing from 1949 until 1967... The unanimously adopted UN Resolution 242 specifies the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from occupied territories. .. these include the Golan Heights, Gaza, the Sinai, and the West Bank, including Jerusalem... U.S. policy was that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza were ̳illegal and obstacles to peace‘... also, as a member of the International Quartet that inc ludes Russia, the United Nations, and the European Union, America supports the Roadmap for Peace which espouses exactly the same requirements...and whose ultimate aim is the creation of a democratic and independent Palestinian state. To highlight U.S. and in ternational efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East, a brief historical review is in order. • The Camp David Accords led directly to the 1979 Israel - Egypt Peace Treaty. • The Madrid Conference was hosted by the government of Spain and co - spons ored by the USA and the USSR. It convened on October 30, 1991, and lasted for three days. It was an early attempt by the international community to start a peace process through negotiations involving Israel and the Palestinians as well as Arab countries i ncluding Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. • The Oslo Accords, agreed in Norway on August 20, 1993, and signed at a public ceremony in Washington D.C. on September 13, 1993, was a milestone in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict. This was the first direct, fac e - to - face agreement between Israel and political representatives of the Palestinians. It was intended to be a framework for the future relations between Israel and the Palestinians, when all outstanding final status issues between the two sides would be ad dressed and resolved in one agreement. Permanent issues such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, borders, and security were deliberately left to be decided at a later stage. • The Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Str ip, also known as Oslo 2, was signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on September 28, 1995. It became the basis and the reference point for subsequent negotiations and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com agreements such as the Hebron Protocol of 1997 and the Wye Riv er Memorandum of 1998, and it is a basis for the latter Road Map for Peace which calls for the creation of a democratic independent Palestinian state, part of the two - state solution for Middle East peace. • The Wye River Memorandum, signed on October 2 3, 1998, was an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of September 1995. • The Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum on Implementation Timeline of Outstanding Commitments of Agreements Signed and the Resumption of Permanent Status Negotiations was signed on September 4, 1999, by Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. Its purpose was to implement the Interim Agreement (Oslo II) and to implement all other agreements be tween the PLO and Israel since 1993. The two sides agreed to resume the Permanent Status negotiations to achieve the goal of reaching a Permanent Status Agreement. They reaffirmed that the negotiations on the Permanent Status will lead to the implementatio n of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. They agreed to make a determined effort to conclude a Framework Agreement and setting a timetable to achieve these goals. A timetable for final status talks to deal with Jerusalem, borders, refugees, and settl ements, and a framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS) were to be achieved by February 2000 with a permanent agreement signed by September 2000. • The Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David of July 2000 took place between U.S. President Bill Clin ton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasir Arafat. It was an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a ―final status settlement‖ to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict. • The Taba Summit were talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, held during January 21 - 27, 2001, at Taba in the Sinai Peninsula. They were talks aimed at reaching the ―final status‖ negotiations to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, and came closer to reaching a final settlement than any previous or subsequent peace talks. The talks were discontinued due to upcoming Israeli elections. As can be seen by the record, U.S. and international efforts to reach a comprehensive settlement for peace in the Middle East and the establishment of an independent and democratic Palestinian state were proceeding nicely until early 2001. One might consider that we, as a global community, were in the end game, late in the fourth quarter or in the bottom of the ninth inning, to use sports analogies – but p erhaps ̳sudden death‘ would be more apt. To have come this far and not taken the ball into the end zone, to have failed to cross the finish line when we were so close, indicates that there must be a very determined and powerful force preventing it. T here must be an opposing power, a well organized political entity whose objective is to prevent any final settlement of the crucial issues in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. This antagonistic element is opposed to any agreement that would allow the esta blishment of an independent and democratic Palestinian state."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com In February 2001, Ariel Sharon was elected prime minister of Israel, and according to former President Jimmy Carter, Sharon was committed to the rejection of the Oslo peace agreement. Histori cally speaking, Ariel Sharon, like many other Israeli politicians, made statements and policies that indicated his intention to kill the peace process. In 1977, Menachem Begin assembled a coalition that accepted his premise that the land in Gaza and the W est Bank belonged rightfully to the State of Israel and should not be exchanged in a peace agreement with the Arabs. In the early 1980s, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Israel announced the annexation of the Golan Heights (taken from Syria) and inc reased their efforts to build Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank and Gaza. As a matter of fact, since 1980, with the Likud Party in control of the government, the confiscation of Arab land has accelerated greatly with the building of illegal Jew ish settlements in the West Bank being one of the government‘s top priorities. Ariel Sharon stated that the East Bank of the Jordan is ―ours but not in our hands, just as East Jerusalem had been until the Six - Day War.‖ During the Clinton years, Prime Min ister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Likud hawk, promised never to exchange land for peace. Then Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon declared the Oslo Agreement to be ―national suicide‖ saying, ―Everybody has to move, run and grab as many hilltops as they can to enlarge the settlements because everything we take now will stay ours.‖ In Jewish History, Jewish Religion , author Israel Shahak, an Israeli Jew critical of Israeli policies, explained the reasons behind the actions of his country‘s government. Shahak wrote: The main danger which Israel, as a ̳Jewish state‘ poses to its own people, to other Jews, and to its neighbors is its ideologically motivated pursuit of territorial expansion and the inevitable series of wars resulting from this aim... In 1956, I eagerly swallo wed all of Prime Minister Ben Gurion‘s political and military reasons for Israel initiating the Suez War, until he pronounced in the Knesset on the third day of that war, that the real reason for it is ̳the restoration of the Kingdom of David and Solomon‘ to its Biblical [Old Testament] borders...The Biblical borders of the land of Israel, ―which rabbinical authorities interpret as ideally belonging to the Jewish state‖ include the following areas: in the south, all of Sinai and a part of northern Egypt up to the environs of Cairo; in the east, all of Jordon and a large chunk of Saudi Arabia, all of Kuwait and a part of Iraq south of the Euphrates; in the north, all of Lebanon and all of Syria together with a huge part of Turkey (up to Lake Van); and in the we st, Cyprus... In May of 1993, Ariel Sharon formally proposed in the Likud Convention that Israel should adopt the ̳Biblical borders‘ concept as its official policy. Well, it sounds as if we may have identified the opponent to the establishment of an independ ent Palestinian state. As we can see, up until shortly before September 2001, U.S. and international efforts to achieve a final agreement and resolution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict were very close to their goal. Shortly before September 11, 2001, an Israeli government was elected whose stated objectives were in sharp opposition to the aims of the peace efforts of the United States and the international community."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Immediately after the 9 - 11 attacks, Israeli spokesman Benjamin Netanyahu stated publi cly, ―It is a very good thing,‖ because it would strengthen American support for Israel. And as if to confirm Netanyahu‘s sentiments, using 9 - 11 as justification, Israel‘s Prime Minister Ariel Sharon escalated the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, pummeling Pa lestinian civilian infrastructure, homes and businesses in the West Bank and Gaza on the pretext of fighting terrorism. Shortly thereafter, Sharon‘s Chief of Staff Dov Weisglass admitted that the purpose of his government's policy to expand settlements in the West Bank was to undermine peace plans, stymie the creation of a Palestinian state, and halt talks about the right of return for Palestinian refugees: The significance of our disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process. It supplies the fo rmaldehyde necessary so there is no political process with the Palestinians. When you freeze the process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state... Effectively, this whole package called a Palestinian state has been removed indefinitely from ou r agenda. All of this was done with the United States' blessing. What? Wait a minute! This was done with the blessing of the government of the United States? What about our ―unwavering official policies‖? What about Israeli settlements in the West Bank bei ng ―illegal and obstacles to peace‖? What about our official support of the creation of an independent and democratic Palestinian State as an integral part of a just and final resolution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and the peace process? Do we have more than one policy here? On March 28, 2001, at the Arab League meeting in Beirut, twenty - two nations ended a long debate by endorsing a resolution introduced by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. It offered Israel normal relations with all Arab states if Israel complied with UN Resolutions 194 and 242. The next day, a massive Israeli military force surrounded and destroyed Yasir Arafat‘s office compound in Ramallah. Later, the United States voted for a UN Security Council resolution demanding Israeli with drawal from Ramallah, which Israel ignored. Arab diplomats accused Ariel Sharon of deliberately sabotaging the peace overture and Crown Prince Abdullah called the prime minister‘s assault on Arafat ―a brutal, despicable, savage, inhumane, and cruel ac tion.‖ In April 2003, a ―Roadmap‖ for resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict was announced by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on behalf of the U.S., the UN, the European Union, and Russia (i.e. the Quartet). Kofi Annan stated: Such a settlement, negotiated between the parties, will result in the emergence of an independent, democratic Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its neighbors. The settlement will end the occupation that began in 1967, based on the M adrid Conference terms of reference and the principle of land for peace, UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 1397, agreements previously reached by the parties, and the Arab initiative proposed by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and endorsed by the A rab Summit in Beirut."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The Palestinians accepted the Roadmap in its entirety. The Israeli government announced several caveats and prerequisites, some of which would preclude any final peace talks. Some of the Israeli provisos were: Israeli control over Pal estine, including the entry and exit of all persons and cargo, plus its airspace and electromagnetic spectrum (radio, television, etc.). No discussion of Israeli settlements in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza or the status of the Palestinian Authority and its ins titutions in Jerusalem. No reference to the key provisions of UN Resolution 242, and the waiver of any right of return of refugees, among others. The practical result of all this, according to former President Jimmy Carter, is the Roadmap for Peace ha s become moot, with only two results: Israel has been able to use it as a delaying tactic with an endless series of preconditions that can never be met, while proceeding with plans to implement its unilateral goals; and the U.S. has been able to give the i mpression of positive engagement in a ―peace process.‖ With Ariel Sharon and George W. Bush in office, the so - called \"peace process\" went nowhere. In early 2005, Jimmy Carter again arrived in Israel. In Palestine Peace Not Apartheid , he describes the ―most disturbing intrusions of the great dividing wall being built by the Israelis.‖ The Israeli separation wall divides the Holy Land. Described as a ̳security fence‘, Carter wrote about the Israeli wall of separation: \"...its other purpose became clear as we observed its construction and examined maps of the barrier‘s ultimate path through Palestine. Including the Israeli - occupied Jordan River Valley, the wall would take in large areas of land for Israel and encircle the Palestinians who remained in thei r remnant of the West Bank. This would severely restrict Palestinian access to the outside world. ̳Imprisonment Wall‘ is more descriptive than ̳security fence.‘"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Sharon‘s purpose was to implement the unilateral disengagement policy and to complete building a wall to separate Palestinians from territory to be claimed by Israel, according to President Carter. In Carter‘s book, he further describes the conditions and developments that have occurred in the Middle East and that have been allowed to occur in the wake of 9 - 11 have taken us further from a final resolution and the creation of an independent and democratic Palestinian state as part of the two - state solution. Carter wrote: With increasing control of East Jerusalem, with relative security from the wall surrounding what is left of the West Bank, and with thousands of remaining settlers east of the wall protected by a strong occupying force, there is a temptation for some Israelis simply to avoid any further efforts to seek a peace agreement based on the Quartet‘s Roadmap or good - faith negotiations on any other basis... In this diplomatic vacuum, Israeli leaders have embarked on a series of unilateral decisions, bypassing both Washington and the Palestinians...Utilizing their political and military domina nce, they are imposing a system of partial withdrawal, encapsulation, and apartheid on the Muslim and Christian citizens of the occupied territories. The driving purpose for the forced separation of the two peoples is...the acquisition of land... The future p rospects for the West Bank are...dismal. Especially troublesome is the huge dividing wall in populated areas and an impassable fence in rural areas. The governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert have built the fence and wall mainly within Palestinian terri tory, intruding deeply into the West Bank to encompass Israeli settlement blocs and large areas of other Palestinian land. It is projected to be at least three and a half times as long as Israel‘s internationally recognized border and already cuts directly through Palestinian villages, divides families from their gardens and farmland... One example is that the wandering wall almost completely surrounds the Palestinian city of Qalqiliya with its 45,000 inhabitants, with most of the citizens‘ land and about on e - third of their water supply confiscated by the Israelis. Almost the same encirclement has occurred around 170,000 citizens of Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus. First, a wide swath must be bulldozed through communities before the wall can be built. In addition to the concrete and electrified fencing materials used in the construction, the barrier includes two meter deep trenches, roads for patrol vehicles, electronic ground and fence sensors, thermal imaging and video cameras, sniper towers, and razor w ire – almost entirely on Palestinian land. The area between the closed segregation barrier and the Israeli border has been designated a closed military region for an indefinite period of time. Israeli directives state that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the closed area has to obtain a ̳permanent resident permit‘ from the civil administration to enable them to live in their own homes... To summarize, whatever territory Israel decides to confiscate will be on its side of the wall, but Israe lis will still control the Palestinians who will be on the other side of the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com barrier... Since 1945, the International Court of Justice has functioned essentially as the judicial arm of the United Nations system, and in July 2004 the court determined that th e Israeli government‘s construction of the segregation wall in the occupied West Bank was illegal...The court called on Israel to cease construction of the wall, to dismantle what has already been built in areas within the occupied Palestinian territory, and to compensate Palestinians who suffered losses as a result of the wall‘s construction. The Israeli Supreme Court has chosen not to accept the International Court‘s decision... The wall ravages many places along its devious route that are important to Chris tians. In addition to enclosing Bethlehem in one of its most notable intrusions, an especially heartbreaking division is on the southern slope of the Mount of Olives, a favorite place for Jesus and his disciples, and very near Bethany, where they often vis ited Mary, Martha, and their brother, Lazarus. There is a church named for one of the sisters, Santa Marta Monastery, where Israel‘s thirty - foot concrete wall cuts through the property. The house of worship is now on the Jerusalem side, and its parishioner s are separated from it because they cannot get permits to enter Jerusalem. Its priest, Father Claudio Ghilardi, says, ̳For nine hundred years we have lived here under Turkish, British, Jordanian, and Israeli governments, and no one has ever stopped people coming to pray. It is scandalous. This is not a barrier. It is a border. Why don‘t they speak the truth?‘ Father Claudio adds a comment that describes the path of the entire barrier: ̳The wall is not separating Palestinians from Jews; rather, Palestinia ns from Palestinians.‘ Nearby are three convents that will also be cut off from people they serve. These 2,000 Palestinian Christians have lost their place of worship and their spiritual center. In addition to cutting off about 200,000 Palestinians in Jer usalem from their relatives, property, schools, and businesses, the wall is designed to complete the enclosure of a severely truncated Palestine, a small portion of its original size, compartmentalized, divided into cantons, occupied by Israeli security fo rces, and isolated from the outside world. In addition, a network of exclusive highways is being built across even these fragments of the West Bank to connect the new Greater Israel in the west with the occupied Jordan River valley in the east, where 7,000 Jews are living in twenty - one heavily protected settlements among about 50,000 Palestinians who are still permitted to stay there. The area along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians, is one of Palestine‘s most lucrative and productive agricultural regions. Most of its inhabitants were forcibly evicted in 1967, and the Israelis have not allowed these original families to return. Israeli customs officers keep lists of their names and are careful t o prohibit their crossing any international checkpoint into occupied territory, where they might lay claim to their homes and farmland. President Carter continues to describe the rather hopeless prospects for the Palestinians, the result of developments that were allowed to occur in the Middle East political arena since the attacks of 9 - 11: \"It is obvious that the Palestinians will be lef t with no territory in which to establish a viable state... The Palestinians will have a future impossible for them or any portion"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com of the international community to accept.\" So it sounds as if a two - state solution to the peace process has become null an d void. Was this the real reason for 9 - 11? Was it carried out to create a condition of war, based on lies, deception, and fraud, that would distract and obfuscate attempts to reach a two - state settlement, which seemed within reach just before September 20 01? Was it designed to allow Israel to continue its unilateral goals of further expansion, to create a Greater Israel that reaches from the Euphrates to the Nile, ethnically cleansing the land of its original inhabitants? Have we established in the Green Zone in Baghdad a base to conduct future operations to assist our Zionist ally with her future expansionist conquests? Do we have more than one policy here? As observers of history and geopolitics, it certainly makes more sense now than the ridiculous, ―T hey attacked us because they hate our freedoms‖ rubbish. Recently, on April 25, 2009, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported: New foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday that Israel was changing its policies on the peace process and was not bound by commitments it made at a U.S. sponsored conference to pursue creation of a Palestinian state... A source in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s party confirmed Wednesday that his new government intended to distance itself from U.S. sponsored under standings on working towards a Palestinian state. ―Israel‘s government said Sunday that it would not halt construction of a planned housing project in east Jerusalem,\" USA TODAY reported on July 20, 2009. \"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabine t there would be no limits on Jewish construction anywhere in ̳unified Jerusalem‘\" and \"declared Israeli sovereignty over the entire city ̳indisputable.‘‖ In September 2009, ―Israel approved on Monday the building of 455 settler homes in the occupied West Bank,\" as reported by Reuters on September 7, 2009. \"A Defense Ministry list of the first such building permits since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in March showed the homes would be erected in areas Israel intends to keep.‖ As Presi dent Jimmy Carter wrote in Palestine Peace Not Apartheid : The overriding problem is that, for more than a quarter century, the actions of some Israeli leaders have been in direct conflict with the official policies of the United States, the international c ommunity, and their own negotiated agreements... Israel‘s continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land. In order to perpetuate the occupation, Israeli forces have d eprived their unwilling subjects of basic human rights. No objective person could personally observe existing conditions in the West Bank and dispute these statements. Two other interrelated factors have contributed to the perpetuation of violence and regional upheaval: the condoning of illegal Israeli actions from a submissive White House"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com and U.S. Congress during recent years, and the deference with which other international leaders permit this unofficial U.

In order to achieve its goals, Israel has decided to avoid any peace negotiations and to escape even the mild restraints of the United States by taking unilateral action, called ̳convergence‘ or ̳realignment,‘ to carve out for itself the ch oice portions of the West Bank, leaving Palestinians destitute within a small and fragmented remnant of their own land. The only rational response to this continuing tragedy is to revitalize the peace process through negotiations between Israelis and Pale stinians, but the United States has, in effect, abandoned this effort. In 1796, George Washington gave his Farewell Address which contained many important parting words of advice for future generations of politicians and citizens alike, the disregard for w hich has helped bring us to this sad post 9 - 11 political world we find ourselves in. President Washington said: Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments, which under any form of government, are inauspiciou s to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty... Nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachment for others should be excluded; and in pla ce of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is su fficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest... So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It also leads to concessions to the favorit e nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to be retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill - will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom e qual privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens, (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gild ing, with the appearance of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliance of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.

As you read Christopher Bollyn‘s Solving 9 - 11: The Deception that Changed the World , you will understand just exactly who and what foreign political interest actually attacked us on September 11, 2001. These foreign political interests with their traitors (G eorge Washington referred to these types as tools and dupes) inside our U.S. political establishment attempted to deceive us in order to pursue their foreign - sponsored political will and expansionist policies in the Middle East. As you read, the real per petrators of the 9 - 11 attacks will become apparent, and they will be identified. The motive will become clear, and you will see this peg as a natural fit. You will understand that our country is filled with ―ambitious, corrupted, and deluded citizens (in p ositions of political power, office holders, judges, the press, etc.) who devote themselves to the foreign nation, and have sacrificed the interests of their own country, with popularity, gilding, with the appearance of a virtuous sense of obligation.

Ke nnedy, February 26, 1962 Eight years have passed since the terror atrocities of September 11, 2001, heinous false - flag terror crimes which took the lives of thousands of innocent people and led to drastic changes in the United States and around the world. Although the terror attacks have yet to be properly investigated and prosecuted by the federal government, we now have scientific evidence that proves that the official explanation is nothing but a pack of lies, a massive deception foisted on the public b y corrupt government officials and the controlled media. Most significantly, this deception was promoted by officials and media owners who knew it to be false. The U.S. Department of Justice, for example, oversaw the destruction of many tons of structura l steel - crucial evidence from the crime scenes. On one hand, the government and media have intentionally pushed a fabrication that a band of Islamic terrorists hijacked airplanes and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, causing the co mplete destruction and pulverization of two 110 - story towers and a 47 - story building in lower Manhattan. Using this deception, the federal government and its agents have created a police state in the United States and forced Americans and other Western na tions to participate in an utterly fraudulent \"War on Terror,\" waging illegal wars of aggression and occupation in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. Untold thousands have died in these illegal wars of aggression. On the other hand, we have scie ntific evidence that the Twin Towers were blown up with an advanced form of super - thermite, chips of which were found in five different samples of the dust from the demolished towers by Dr. Steven E. Jones of Brigham Young University. This crucial"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com discove ry, published as a peer - reviewed paper in March 2009 with other scientists, completely disproves the official version that the Twin Towers fell as a result of fires caused by the plane crashes. This discovery also explains the explosive destruction and pu lverization of the immense steel - frame and concrete buildings. As Professor Jones says, \"The data doesn't lie.\" Rather than addressing the evidence that the World Trade Center was demolished with explosives, however, the new administration of President B arack Obama continues to use the 9 - 11 deception to increase the war effort in Afghanistan, occupying a nation that had nothing to do with the terror attacks in the United States. Neither Osama Bin Laden nor the Taliban had anything to do with the demoliti on of the World Trade Center, which the evidence proves was carried out using an advanced form of Thermite created using nano - technology. Nor did the airplane crashes themselves cause the towers to collapse. The plane crashes were merely part of the dece ption, meant to provide a plausible explanation for the pre - planned explosive demolitions that followed. This is why 2009 is such a crucial year for 9 - 11 truth. A modern republic like the United States cannot continue for very long as a free nation with a government and media that lie to the people about the murder of thousands of its citizens and illegal wars supposedly waged on their behalf. This is clearly a state in the process of a revolutionary change. The American people will not tolerate a polic e state using such outrageous lies to rob them of their money and freedom. \"We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts,\" President John F. Kennedy said in 1962. \"For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth a nd falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\" So, who is really afraid of unpleasant facts and the truth of 9 - 11? It is not the people, but the culprits of the terror atrocity and the subsequent cover - up who fear the truth. M y work provides some of the unpleasant but essential facts about 9 - 11. It represents eight years of work and is dedicated to the truth and the people who died on that day. It is unacceptable that their deaths, and the suffering of their families, have be en exploited to deceive the world and wage illegal wars.

From my position as a skeptic of the unproven o fficial version, I have examined the facts and evidence since the day it happened and have concluded that the U.S. government and controlled media have engaged in a conspiracy to deceive the world about what really happened on that terrible day. THE DREAM The early morning hours of September 11, 2001 found me with my family driving through New York City en route to Washington, D.C. after a weekend trip to Stowe, Vermont. We had visited the Trapp family lodge and gotten a late start from Stowe on Monday a fternoon. By the time we reached New York City, our two small children were fast asleep in the back seat of our rented Buick. Because the hotels were all full or outrageously expensive, I was left with no choice but to continue driving down the highway when I should have been sleeping. To keep me awake as I drove through New York City, my wife Helje told me about a vivid dream she had had a week earlier, the night before we had left our home near Chicago."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com I had heard parts of Helje's strange dream when she had first told it to our children in the backseat of the car as we set out across Indiana for Washington, D.C. Now, to help keep me awake on the busy highways of New York City, she told me her dream from the week before. In the dream we were driving toward a city with a skyline of densely packed skyscrapers when a large airplane flew right at our car and dove into the road about 50 meters in front of us. She turned and saw the plane emerge from the ground behind us and another plane coming at us fro m another angle. This was a strange dream in which she felt that our family had been under attack. Helje's dream turned out to be an eerie and uncanny premonition of what was to happen in the skies of New York City less than eight hours later. It was ab out 3 a.m. on September 11 when we finally found an affordable hotel room just inside the state of Maryland on Interstate 95. The kids woke up and jumped on the beds and then we all fell asleep about a half - hour later. I woke up about 8:30 a.m. and went down to the lobby for a cup of coffee. The television was on in the breakfast area reporting that a plane had struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. I grabbed some pastries and coffee and hurried back to the room and turned the te levision to the news channel. The children and I went to get more donuts and coffee and were on our way back to the room when the second plane hit the South Tower. Helje had seen it happen live on television. We were shocked by the events and realized t hat America was under attack. I immediately called my office in Washington , D.C. and told my boss that kamikaze airplanes had hit the World Trade Center. He thought I was joking. I said I wouldn't joke about such a thing and told him to turn on the radi o. I called the office again after the Pentagon was hit and said we would not be coming to Washington but were heading home to Chicago. Having no idea what would happen next, I thought it would be best to take the country roads and stay away from big cit ies. We drove through rural Lancaster County past Amish farmers harvesting a very tall corn crop. I stopped and walked into the fields to ask some of the German - speaking farmers if they knew what had happened in New York City . They said they had not heard anything about it and carried on working with their horse - drawn harvester. Our route from Pennsylvania to Chicago took us near the site in Shanksville where Flight 93 supposedly crashed, but I had no desire to go to the scene of the disaster . We stopped for lunch in a small town. The diner was full of people but nobody was talking. The people sat quietly, as if mesmerized, listening to the news on the radio. INDICATIONS OF ISRAE LI INVOLVEMENT We listened to the radio as we dro ve across Pennsylvania. It was a beautiful sunny day with a bright blue sky. About noon I heard a news report that five \"Middle Eastern\" men had been seen in New Jersey videotaping and celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com \"They're prob ably Israelis,\" I told Helje. For millions of Americans who automatically associate \"Middle Eastern\" with Arab, this news report planted the idea in their minds that Arabs from the Middle East were behind the terror attacks on New York and Washington. Th is line of thinking quickly became the media's only acceptable version of events and although it has still not been proven, it has become the official version of 9 - 11. The first indication that the attack on the World Trade Center was an elaborate \"false flag\" operation came with the arrest of the five men on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River . These men, described as \"Middle Eastern\" in the first media reports, were later identified as Israelis. A false flag operation is a crime which is designed an d carried out so that another party or nation is blamed. That the five jubilant Middle Eastern men, who had photographed themselves smiling and celebrating with the burning World Trade Center in the background, were indeed Israelis (namely Sivan and Paul K urzberg, Oded Ellner, Omer Marmari, and Yaron Schmuel) and that two of them were known to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies as agents of Israeli intelligence, was ignored by the mass media. The men had been observed taking video or photos of themselves with the World Trade Center burning in the background. Sivan Kurzberg told the police that the men had been driving in their van in the immediate vicinity of the towers that morning. He was photographed flicking a lighter with the burning towe rs behind him. A woman who had observed the jubilant Israelis said she was struck by the expressions on the men's faces. \"They were like happy, you know,\" she said. \"They didn't look shocked to me. I thought it was very strange.\" When they were arrested , Sivan, the driver of the van, told the police, \"We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem.\" The story of the five men celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers was dropped from the nat ional news when it became known that they were not Arabs or Muslims from the Middle East, but Jews from Israel. The noteworthy fact that these men, who clearly had prior knowledge of the attacks, were in fact Israelis, and that they had been arrested at g unpoint with box cutter knives, multiple passports, and thousands of dollars in cash in a van that tested positive for explosives was only reported by Paolo Lima in a local New Jersey newspaper, the Bergen Record , the following day. This important and tim ely information, however, was completely ignored by the New York Times and the other national mass media outlets based across the river in New York City . I discussed the pertinent details with Lima by phone, and this important and suppressed story became the subject of my first article about 9 - 11. I realized then, during the first week after 9 -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com 11, that the mainstream news media was ignoring and covering up important information and evidence about the terrorist attacks. There would be, for example, no reporting in the mainstream media of Israeli involvement or prior knowledge of the attacks. And this was just the beginning of the censorship the controlled media was to impose on the events of 9 - 11. The possibility that these men could be Israeli intell igence agents involved in a spectacular \"false flag\" terror attack was discussed in my article that went to print in the American Free Press on September 20, 2001. It was the only newspaper in the United States where such thoughts could openly be expresse d. Months later, Forward , a well known New York - based Jewish newspaper, confirmed that Urban Moving Systems, the Weehawken, New Jersey - based \"moving\" company that the men worked for, was actually an Israeli intelligence front operation and that at least t wo of the men, evidently the Kurzberg brothers, were known agents of Mossad, Israel's military intelligence agency. Dominic Suter, the Israeli \"owner\" of the company and a prime suspect, was somehow allowed to flee to Israel after the Federal Bureau of In vestigation had initially interviewed him, but before they could interrogate him a second time. He has not been extradited to the United States since. After being held for 10 weeks, the five Israelis were sent back to Israel on visa violations. Ellner, Marmari, and Schmuel appeared on an Israeli television show, without the Kurzberg brothers, in November 2001. The three sheepish and suspiciously guilty looking young men admitted on Israeli television that they had prior knowledge of the terror attacks that changed America – and the world. \"The fact of the matter is that we come from a country that experiences terror daily,\" Oded Ellner (center) said. \"Our purpose was to document the event.\" The obvious question, \"And who gave you that task?\" was not a sked, at least not openly."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com One would think that such a revealing public admission by a suspect, claiming prior knowledge of the terror attack and saying that his purpose \"was to document the event\" would be extremely newsworthy information in the United S tates. Sadly, this was not the case. Rather than discuss the evidence, the mainstream media has constructed and defended an unproven version of events in which the blame is assigned to nineteen Arabs with ties to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida. Indication s of Israeli involvement in 9 - 11 were conspicuous from the beginning. Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister and leader of the right wing Likud Party, actually said that he viewed 9 - 11 as a positive development. On the day of the attacks, Ne tanyahu was interviewed by James Bennet of the New York Times : Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, replied, \"It's very good.\" Then he edited himself: \"Well , it's not good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.\" Benjamin Netanyahu (right) and Ehud Olmert are Israeli politicians from the extreme right - wing Likud party, which grew out of the Zionist terror organization, the Irgun. Olmert, then mayor of J erusalem, made a secret visit to New York City the day before the terror attacks. Asked what the attacks meant for U.S. - Israeli relations, Netanyahu said, \"It's very good.\" Netanyahu predicted that the attack would \"strengthen the bond between our two peo ples, because we've experienced terror of so many decades, but the United States has now experienced a massive hemorrhaging of terror.\" Prior knowledge of the 9 - 11 attacks clearly indicates complicity in the murder of some 3,000 people.

The level of the personal attacks against me increased dramatically in August 2006, when a police assault by three unidentified heavily - armed men resulted in my right elbow being fractured and my being unjustifiably shocked with 50,00 0 volts from a police device known as a TASER. This outrageous and illegal assault occurred at my home in front of my wife and eight - year - old daughter. I was taken to jail and subsequently charged by the police with resisting arrest and aggravated assaul t, both misdemeanor charges. In the Chicago system nearly everyone in such a situation is forced to plead guilty and accept the sentence meted out by the judge. I refused to plead guilty, however, and spent nearly one year trying to defend myself against the baseless charges and malicious prosecution. In early June 2007, I was found guilty of both misdemeanors after a seriously flawed four - day - trial in which the police were allowed to destroy the video evidence and then lied on the stand. My expert witn ess and evidence were not allowed to be presented by the Cook County judge, Hyman Riebman, a Zionist Jew. Having seen that there was no way to obtain justice in the corrupt court system, I was compelled to leave Chicago with my family before the date of s entencing. It would have been irresponsible for me to allow this criminal system to cause more harm to me and my family than it already had. ODIGO WARNINGS In the first days and weeks after 9 - 11, I paid very close attention to the large number of Israeli terror suspects arrested, which was more than two hundred by November 2001, and investigated the published reports that an Israeli instant text message service had been used to warn Israelis of the attacks in New York, hours before they occurred. Many Is raelis were evidently forewarned of the attacks through an Israeli instant messaging service called Odigo. This story, which presents the clearest evidence of Israeli prior knowledge of the attacks, was reported only very briefly in the U.S. media – and th en forgotten. According to the published reports, Israel - based employees of Odigo reported having received warnings of an imminent attack at the World Trade Center hours before the first plane hit the north tower. Odigo, an Israeli - owned company, had its U.S. headquarters two blocks from the World Trade Center, but the forewarned Odigo employees did not pass the terror warning on to the authorities in New York , an act that would have saved thousands of lives. Two weeks after 9 - 11, Alex Diamandis, Odigo's vice president, said, \"The messages said something big was going to happen in a certain amount of time, and it did – almost to the minute.\" \"It was possible that the attack warning was broadcast to other Odigo members, but the company has not received re ports of other recipients of the message,\" Diamandis said. Four thousand Israelis were expected to have been working at the World Trade Center on 9 - 11, yet only one was reported to have died at the complex. Based on the Israeli government figure that 4,0 00 Israelis were expected to have been at the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks, it seems evident that many Israeli Odigo users got the message of warning."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Odigo, which offers real - time messaging, has a feature called \"People Finder\" which all ows a user to send an instant message to a large group based on a common characteristic, such as Israeli nationality. \"People Finder\" allows Odigo users to search for online \"buddies,\" with filters like Israeli nationality, while maintaining user privacy at all times. The message was probably sent in Hebrew. The Internet address of the sender of the warning was allegedly given to the FBI. Two months later it was reported that the FBI was still investigating the matter. Since then there have been no furt her media reports about the Odigo warning of 9/11. These two news stories about the fake Israeli \"movers\" and the Odigo messages, which clearly indicated that some Israelis had very specific prior knowledge of the attacks, were published in American and I sraeli newspapers shortly after 9 - 11. Had the recipients of these Odigo instant messages contacted the New York police department, thousands of lives could have been saved. The question that has not been asked is, why didn't they? CUI BONO? There were several early indicators that Israelis were involved in 9 - 11 and that it was a spectacular \"false flag\" terror attack designed to serve as a casus belli to drag the United States into the \"War on Terror.\" Apart from the previously mentioned evidence of Is raeli prior knowledge, there were also the amazingly insensitive comments of Netanyahu about 9 - 11 being \"very good\" in his view. Netanyahu, it should be noted, is the author of several books which call for the western nations to engage in a global \"War on Terror.\" Since 1986, Netanyahu has urged the United States and western democracies to take up arms against the enemies of Israel in the name of \"fighting terrorism,\" which is the title of one of his books. The \"terrorists\" that Netanyahu wants the West to wage war on, however, all happen to be the people and states opposed to Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian land. I approached the 9 - 11 investigation with a twenty - five year history of having lived in and followed the events of the Middle East. After many years of traveling in Europe and the Middle East, I obtained a degree in History from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1992. My academic emphasis was on Palestine and Israel. After the first U.S. war against Iraq, which I was act ively opposed to, I spent my final year of university training researching the Soviet occupation of the newly liberated Baltic republics and completing my courses at the University of Bergen in Norway. Fate brought me into the proximity of another mass di saster on the morning of September 28, 1994, when I arrived by ship in Sweden and learned that the Baltic ferry named Estonia had sunk during the night with 852 victims lost at sea. My wife's first husband, a famous Estonian singer named Urmas Alender, wa s among the missing. While it was abundantly clear that something much more explosive than a \"monster wave\" had sunk the ferry, the Swedish government and media pretended that natural forces had caused the catastrophe. In the process of investigating wha t happened in the ferry disaster, I came to realize that a modern \"democratic\" state, like Sweden, could actually be complicit in the cover - up of the mass murder of hundreds of its own citizens."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com When in the year 2000, I began working as a journalist for t he Washington - based Spotlight , later to become the American Free Press , I turned my attention to the mysterious 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of New York. I attended the final sessions of the government agency (NTSB) involved in investigating the \"crash\" of Flight 800 and was appalled at the obvious cover - up of the facts. I watched how three Jewish members of the board completely dominated the NTSB final sessions and how the testimonies of more than 100 eyewitnesses, who had testified to havi ng seen a streaking object hitting the aircraft in flight, were categorically dismissed because, according to a young Jewish member of the board, based on the time of the observations, all of the witnesses must have been drunk and hallucinating. After the two - day presentation of the NTSB findings there was no press conference or session allowing for questions from the media or public. This was clearly another cover - up. I had also studied the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty and seen how the U.S. government and military had covered up the truth of the Israeli military attack on the unarmed Navy vessel off the coast of Egypt in 1967. With this background I approached the events of 9 - 11. Well aware of the history of false - flag terror, the over whelming Zionist influence in government and media, and dishonest official investigations into recent mass disasters, I was a natural skeptic from the start. EVIDENCE OF EXPLOSIO NS IGNORED The administration of George W. Bush rushed the nation and its al lies into war in Afghanistan within one month of the 9 - 11 attacks using the unsolved crime as the casus belli for an overt act of aggression that had been planned long before. The war against the government of Afghanistan, called Operation Enduring Freedo m by the government and military, began on Oct. 7, 2001. The week before the war began I wrote an article about the immense oil and gas reserves of the Caspian Basin and the new \"Great Game\" to gain control of these valuable energy resources. I also wrot e several articles about the long - standing business and personal ties between George W. Bush and the Bin Laden family. One month after 9 - 11, I wrote about how the mass media was ignoring the large number of eyewitness accounts describing explosions at the World Trade Center before the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7. \"Despite reports from numerous eyewitnesses and experts, including news reporters on the scene, who heard or saw explosions immediately before the collapse of the World Trade Cente r, there has been a virtual silence in the mainstream media,\" I wrote in the article titled \"Some Survivors Say 'Bombs Exploded Inside WTC.'\" \"After the airplanes hit the World Trade Center there were some explosive devices inside the buildings that cause d the towers to collapse,\" Van Romero, an explosives expert and former director of the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center at New Mexico Tech, told the Albuquerque Journal minutes after the collapses. The collapse of the structures resembled c ontrolled implosions used to demolish old structures and was \"too methodical to be a chance result of airplanes colliding with the structures,\" Romero said. Coming from a man who is an"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com expert in the effects of explosives on structures, Romero's comments c arried a lot of weight in my opinion. \"It would be difficult for something from the plane to trigger an event like that,\" Romero said. If explosions did cause the towers to collapse, \"It could have been a relatively small amount of explosives placed in st rategic points.\" \"One of the things terrorist events are noted for is a diversionary attack and secondary device,\" he said. Then suddenly, ten days after the attack, without any explanation, Romero did a complete about - face in his analysis of the collaps e. \"Certainly the fire is what caused the building to fail,\" he told the Albuquerque Journal on September 21. A friend of mine from Brooklyn told me that he had been standing among a crowd of people on Church Street, about two blocks from the South Tower (WTC 2), when he saw \"a number of brief light sources being emitted from inside the building between floors 10 and 15.\" He saw about six of these brief flashes, accompanied by \"a crackling sound\" immediately before the tower collapsed. Even a veteran 51 - y ear - old fire fighter, Louie Cacchioli, told People magazine that he had witnessed explosions in the South Tower: \"I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there were bombs set in the building.\" What is most peculiar about the eyewitness reports of explosions was that they were completely ignored by the mainstream news media, even when the reports came from their own reporters on the scene. Stephen E vans of the BBC, for example, was in the South Tower where he witnessed \"a series of explosions\" and felt a \"big explosion, from much, much lower.\" Yet the BBC, like the rest of the mainstream media failed to investigate or even discuss the evidence of ex plosions in the towers. How did the editors of the mass media networks in the United States and Britain make the decision not to discuss the evidence of explosions even when the information came from their own reporters on the scene? Eyewitness reports an d images of explosions were broadcast only once and then swept under the carpet. It soon became quite clear that the mass media was censoring any discussion of the evidence of explosions in the World Trade Center. Within a few weeks I realized that the m edia and government were working together to deceive the public about what really had happened on 9 - 11 and that there was a conspiracy to promote a false version of events in order to gain public support for a previously planned war policy in the Middle Ea st. The mass media engaged in a comprehensive propaganda campaign to instill fear in the public. My family and I decided that it would be safer and more sane to live in Europe, so at the end of November, after the Thanksgiving holiday, we flew to Germany . DESTRUCTION OF EVIDE NCE"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com In Germany, I had the opportunity to interview Andreas von Bülow near Köln. Von Bülow, an author and former member of the Bundestag (the German parliament) served on the parliamentary commission which oversees the three branches of the German secret service. Von Bülow said he thought Israel's intelligence service, Mossad, was behind the 9 - 11 attacks. These attacks, he said, were carried out to turn public opinion against the Arabs and boost military and security spending. \"You don't get the higher echelons,\" von Bülow said, referring to the \"architectural structure\" which masterminds such terror attacks. At this level, he said, the organization doing the planning, such as Mossad, is primarily interested in affecting public opini on. The terrorists who actually commit the crimes are what von Bülow calls \"the working level,\" such as the nineteen Arabs who allegedly hijacked the planes on September 11. \"The working level is part of the deception,\" he said. \"Ninety - five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the world is deception and disinformation,\" he said, which is widely propagated in the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events. \"Journalists don't even raise the simplest questions,\" he said. \" Those who differ are labeled as crazy.\" Eckehardt Werthebach, the former president of the Verfassungsschutz (a branch of German intelligence), told me that \"the deathly precision\" and \"the magnitude of planning\" behind the attacks would have needed \"years of planning.\" Such a sophisticated operation, Werthebach said, required the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization, something not found in a \"loose group\" of terrorists. Both Werthebach and von Bülow said the lack of a complete \"blue ribbon\" investigation, with congressional hearings, into the events of September 11 was incomprehensible. These men made more sense to me than anyone in the U.S. government or media. As incomprehensible as it might seem, the Bush administration delayed and avoi ded an official investigation for as long as possible – at least until all of the evidence was destroyed. The steel from the World Trade Center was quickly shipped to Asia where it was melted down. The evidence from the crime scene was being destroyed as quickly as possible. This was clearly criminal, yet the highest authorities in the U.S. government and the Department of Justice were allowing it to happen. MOLTEN METAL I consider 9 - 11 to be an unsolved crime and have done what I could to investigate the crime using the available evidence. In the summer of 2002, for example, I wrote an article about the seismic data that showed unexplained spikes occurring at the beginning of each collapse. In my research into the removal of the rubble, I learned fr om one of the contractors and a demolition expert that molten metal had been discovered at the bottom of the rubble pile in the lower basement levels. This molten metal was described to me as \"molten steel\" by Peter Tully, president of Tully Construction of Flushing, New York, and Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Maryland."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The molten steel was found \"three, four, and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed,\" Loizeaux said. He said molten steel was also found at WTC 7, the 47 - story building owned by Larry Silverstein, which collapsed mysteriously in the late afternoon. Loizeaux said, \"If I were to bring the towers down, I would put explosives in the basement to get the weight of the building to help coll apse the structure.\" The molten metal found beneath the rubble was clearly important evidence that could explain how the towers were brought down. Because each tower was held up by 47 huge box core columns, there had to be an explanation for what caused these columns to fall. The official explanation that fires had caused the floor trusses to give way failed to explain what happened to the core columns. To explain the extremely quick collapse of the core columns, the seismic spikes and molten metal seem ed to be very important clues. Steven E. Jones, a professor of physics at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah, contacted me in the summer of 2005 and asked me what I had learned about the discovery of molten metal at the World Trade Center. I told Jon es exactly what Peter Tully and Mark Loizeaux had said about the discovery of molten iron in the basements of the Twin Towers and Building 7. After studying the reports and photographs of molten metal, Jones had been able to obtain some fragments of the m etal. He concluded that the fragments were primarily iron and possible evidence that Thermite had been used to demolish the buildings. The author and Professor Steven E. Jones discuss the evidence of thermite in May 2006. Encouraged by his research, I visited Professor Jones on the campus of Brigham Young University in the spring of 2006. From Provo, Utah, I then traveled by train to the University of California at Davis where I met with Professor Thomas A. Cahill, an expe rt on airborne particles. Dr. Cahill had conducted a study of the particles contained in the thin bluish smoke that rose from the rubble for nearly four months after 9 - 11. Cahill's air sampling began on October 2, 2001 and continued until late December, after the last fires were finally extinguished."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Asked why it took so long to begin a scientific evaluation of the air contamination that accompanied the destruction of the WTC, Dr. Cahill said he had assumed that there were scores of agencies and scientis ts monitoring the air quality in New York City after 9 - 11. \"I assumed it was happening. I could not believe it was not,\" Cahill said. \"The EPA did nothing.\" Cahill's work revealed the presence of extremely small metallic aerosols in unprecedented amounts in the plumes coming from the burning WTC rubble. Most of the particles in these plumes were in the categories of ultra - fine and nano - particles: from 0.26 to 0.09 microns. The extraordinarily high level of ultra - fine aerosols was one of the most unusual aspects of the data, Cahill said. \"Ultra - fine particles require extremely high temperatures,\" he said, \"namely the boiling point of the metal.\" Since the scientific data supports the theory that some form of Thermite was used to destroy the towers, the q uestion is how it got onto the 81st floor of the south tower, where large amounts of molten metal were seen falling before the collapse?

THE COVER - UP CONTINUES Despite the lega l difficulties, slander, criticism, and other setbacks, I have continued to examine the evidence from 9 - 11 and ask the questions that demand to be answered. The wasted lives of the thousands of victims from the terror attacks and the illegal wars that hav e been waged in the name of 9 - 11 deserve to be honored with the truth, not a pack of lies pushed by the controlled media onto a gullible public. It would be naïve and foolish for us to expect the truth from a government that has been shown to have repeate dly lied to the media and international community in order to accomplish its dubious goals.

Guantanamo - An affront to American values In December 2001, veteran German intelligence professionals told me that 9 - 11 had been executed by a state - sponsored criminal network and had required years of planning. Eckehardt Werthebach, the former president of Germany's domestic intelligence service, Verfassungsschutz , told me in 2001 that \"the deathly prec ision\" and \"the magnitude of planning\" of the 9 - 11 attacks would have required \"years of planning.\" Such a sophisticated operation, Werthebach said, would require the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization, something not found in a \"loose grou p\" like the one allegedly led by Mohammed Atta while he studied in Hamburg. If Werthebach's analysis is correct, and I have every reason to believe it is, the official version is nothing but a pack of lies. This would mean that the members of the criminal network are still in the highest positions of power in the U.S., Israel, and other nations. The members of this network are dedicated to preventing the evidence from being released because it would expose the real perpetrators. This is the only logical r eason why the 9 - 11 evidence has been suppressed, the investigation controlled, and the litigation and discovery processes obstructed."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com At this point, it should be clear that 9 - 11 will never be solved by the federal government, politically appointed investi gators, law enforcement agencies, or the corrupt courts. These controlled agencies, like the Zionist - controlled media, are only interested in controlling the information and preventing the real truth from being revealed. This crime will only be solved by concerned and dedicated independent researchers. THE ZIONIST STRATEGY 9 - 11 was a very sophisticated operation, as Werthebach said, which required the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization. It was carefully planned years in advance and carrie d out for one strategic purpose: to kick - start the Zionist - planned \"War on Terror.\" The rabid neo - con Zionists who have dominated the Bush administration pushed the \"War on Terror\" with its criminal wars of aggression, occupation, and Balkanization in the Middle East as the strategic response to 9 - 11. The Zionist media moguls, who dominate the U.S. mass media, have in turn pushed the \"war on terror\" into the public mind as the suitable and proper response to the attacks, which they have refused to investig ate. An Israeli official named Oded Yinon revealed the Zionist strategy to Balkanize the entire Middle East into ethnic mini - states in the early 1980s. The plan for a global \"War on Terror\" to accomplish this goal has been articulated since the mid - 1980s ad nauseam by Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister of the extreme right - wing Likud party. The Israeli military's plans to realize these strategic goals have obviously been in the works for at least three decades. THE HOAX OF 9 - 11 9 - 11 is , in fact, a gigantic hoax. Only by exposing the terrorist masterminds behind 9 - 11 will we reveal the criminals behind the fraudulent \"War on Terror\" and the epidemic of \"false flag\" terrorism that plagues the world. False flag terrorism is a crime design ed and committed by the architects with the intention of having it blamed on another faction, state, or organization. The media outlets, which the criminals control, facilitate the blame game by repeating the chorus as if from a script and stifling any ind ependent investigation or analysis of the crime. 9 - 11, after all, remains an unsolved crime. It is, however, quite obvious who is responsible for blocking discovery and obstructing justice for the victims and their relatives.

Bernard S.

There has been no independent investigation of 9 - 11 done by the controlled media other than Carl Cameron's now deeply - buried four - part series on FOX News in December 2001. Think about this for a minute. The mass media in the land of the \"free press\" has not done any independent investigation about the crime of the century. The evidence of Israeli involvement in 9 - 11 is too obvious, so senior editors in the controlled media don't let their journalists even approach the subject. The journalists of the \"free press\" in the United States are, unfortunately, confined to the same \"Auschwitz of the Mind\" as the American public they write for. They know very well that to touch the subject of Israeli involvement in 9 - 11 would be like touching a live wire. Likewise, when it comes to tracking the Israeli criminal network that has operated in the United States for decades, the U.S. media is simply a dog that won't bark - or hunt. The extent of Zionist control over the U.S. mass med ia, including the Internet, is astounding. The mass media has effectively prevented most Americans from understanding who is really behind the false flag terror attacks of 9 - 11, and, by extension, the illegal and genocidal wars in Afghanistan, Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq. The controlled media has also left Americans with an extremely distorted view of the Middle East, Zionism, and the history of the Zionist state, Israel.

Sharon is a Zionist extremist who believes that every Jew should live in Israeli - occupied Palestine. Realistically, what else besides ter rorism and bloodshed should one expect from such fanatical and genocidal terrorists? Ariel \"Arik\" Sharon (smiling on left) with Moshe Dayan and members of his notorious \"anti - terror\" Unit 101 (1953 - 56) which committed a number of atrocities such as the Q ibya Massacre of October 1953 in which 69 Palestinians were killed, many whose houses were blown up over their heads. Forty - five houses, a school, and a mosque were destroyed. Sharon, a well known terrorist, became Israel's prime minister in 2001. The s ons and daughters of the original Zionist terrorists have occupied the highest positions of power in the Israeli government. Tzipora Malka \"Tzipi\" Livni, for example, the foreign minister (2006 - 09), is the daughter of the former terror chief of the Irgun. Born in Tel Aviv in July 1958, \"Tzipi\" is the daughter of Eitan Livni (born Yerucham Bzozowitch in Grodno ) a Polish - born Irgun terrorist associated with the King David Hotel bombing.

There has only been one article that I have found that mentions what ATASCO has been doing for the past 36 years in the United States, since it was first created by the Israeli Defense Ministry in 1971. That article, entitled \"Ugandan Plane Deal Believed Key to Israeli Spy Operation,\" was published in the Washington Post of September 11, 1978. This investigative arti cle, which involved an international team of journalists that included an Israeli, focused on the \"mysterious Israeli tycoon and the Mossad, Israeli's intelligence service,\" and how they had provided the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin with two Boeing 707 jetlin ers as part of an Israeli effort to spy on Libya. The \"big winner\" and tycoon in this Mossad spying operation was Shaul Nehemia Eisenberg (1921 - 1997), \"the reclusive Israeli entrepreneur at its center.\" Eisenberg was, as the Washington Post reported in 1 978, the central figure in the Mossad spying operation on Libya: The chief Eisenberg firm in these deals was Aircraft Trading and Services Inc., or Atasco. Headquartered in Asia House, Eisenberg's luxury building in Tel Aviv, Atasco also has branches in the \"Eisenberg Building\" in New York and in London. Atasco was put together in 1971 by executives of Israeli Aircraft Industries, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Israeli Defense Ministry that makes planes and missiles. Eisenberg got into Atasco as an eq ual partner with Israeli Aircraft for $500,000 in cash. After the 1973 Middle East War, Israeli Aircraft, staggered by scandals, sold its share in Atasco to Eisenberg, leaving him its sole owner. The rest of Atasco's original capital, $5 million, came fro m the U.S. Export - Import Bank, which is supposed to make loans to promote American exports. The Ex - Im Bank certainly found the right man in Eisenberg. He quickly turned into an eager customer for Pan American Airways' used Boeing 707s.

The Washington Post , one of the most important newspapers in the United States, is a leading national newspaper of record. Oddly, however, the extremely important information contained in this article about ATASCO was never repeated in any of the subsequent articles in which t his mysterious company was mentioned, for example, when Gerald L.

The rumors about the Bush and Clinton families being involved in large scale drug smuggling operation s are legion. From George H.W. Bush's days in the Texas oil business and as head of the CIA to his position as a director of the Prozac giant Eli Lilly and Company, the drug trade is a central part of the Bush family legend. The allegations about Governo r Bill Clinton's involvement in the drug smuggling operation in Mena, Arkansas are also legion. Aircraft were used to smuggle drugs and weapons through the airport in Mena in the 1980s while Gov. Clinton protected the entire operation. \"Given the scope an d implications of the Mena story, it may be easy to understand the media's initial skepticism and reluctance,\" Sally Denton and Roger Morris wrote in their July 1995 article \"The Crimes of Mena\": Mena, from 1981 to 1985, was indeed one of the centers for international smuggling traffic. According to official I.R.S. and D.E.A. calculations, sworn court testimony, and other corroborative records, the traffic amounted to thousands of kilos of cocaine and heroin and literally hundreds of millions of dollars in drug"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com profits. According to a 1986 letter from the Louisiana attorney general to then U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese, [Adler Berriman Seal, or \"Barry\"] Seal \"smuggled between $3 billion and $5 billion of drugs into the U.S.\" Adler Berriman Seal had bee n a pilot with TWA from 1966 to 1974, according to his on - line biography. Gitner, who began his career at TWA in 1968 was a vice president when he also left TWA in 1974 to join the much smaller Texas International Airlines. The numerous reports and allega tions of involvement in drug smuggling are what the Bush and Clinton families have in common. These are the families which have dominated the executive branch of the United States government since 1981. There has been either a Bush or Clinton in the White House for the past 26 years, since January 1981. Is the illegal drug business the central criminal activity that the Bush and Clinton families have participated in with the Israeli Mossad? If the reports, allegations, and rumors are true, the illegal dru g trade is where the interests of the Bush family, the Clintons, the CIA, and the Mossad all come together. This would explain the choice to invade and occupy Afghanistan, where opium production is now at record levels after having been nearly eradicated u nder the Taliban regime. This would also explain the unusual pressure to medicate the 9 - 11 relatives. It appears that drug smuggling could very well be the illegal enterprise at the center of the criminal network behind 9 - 11. This is a subject that certa inly deserves further investigation. \"CLIPPER JUPITER\" AND ZIMEX AVIATION In the 1978 article about Eisenberg and the Mossad the Washington Post reported that ATASCO had sold the Boeing 707, which had been Pan Am's \"Clipper Jupiter,\" to a firm in Zurich, which had immediately transferred ownership to Idi Amin in Uganda: Intelligence sources say that the head of this Zurich firm is a 15 - year veteran of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and the firm is an agency 'laundry.' It exists, these sources sa y, to pass on Mossad funds for deals in which the Israeli secret service is interested. Pan Am's \"Clipper Jupiter,\" with tail registration number N766PA, was sold to a Zurich - based company called Zimex Aviation on May 12, 1976. The same day, Zimex Aviatio n transferred the plane with a new tail number, 5X - UAL, to Uganda Airlines.

ATASCO TIES TO 9 - 11 Gitner reportedly stayed with ATASCO from October 1986 through December 1989. In 1989, Gitner was appointed to head Presidential A irways of Herndon, Virginia. Gitner later served on the board of directors of another Mossad - run company, ICTS, which is one of the key defendants in the 9 - 11 litigation. Along with a handful of senior Israeli Mossad veterans, Gitner was a director of ICT S from at least 1997 through 2005. Most significantly, he was a director of the Israeli parent company which was responsible for airline security and passenger screening at Boston's Logan Airport on 9 - 11. International Consultants on Targeted Security (IC TS) International, N.V. is the Mossad - run company that owns Huntleigh USA , the airline security company that oversaw the passenger screening operation at Boston and Newark airports on September 11, 2001. How would Gitner be a director or CEO of a Mossad - r un company like ATASCO or ICTS if he were not working for the Mossad? Has Gerald Gitner from Boston been working with the Israelis since he began at TWA in the late 1960s? Is this the reason he left TWA and began working for Texas International?

Millions of Americans have blindly accepted, without any pro of, the government and controlled media's tale that nineteen Arabs, who lacked basic piloting skills, were responsible for the coordinated precision aerial attacks and subsequent carnage and destruction of 9 - 11. On the other hand, the same government and media have shown absolutely no interest in probing the evidence or looking into the many unanswered questions surrounding the attacks. There can only be one logical explanation for the persistent avoidance of the evidence by the institutions that should b e leading the investigation. It is because the evidence does not fit or contradicts the fictitious tale they have presented to the public. The number of people who realize that the government and media have lied about 9 - 11 is significant and continues to grow all the time. The pack of lies surrounding the attacks has been thoroughly exposed and can no longer be supported. Unable to defend their fictional tale against the evidence presented by honest scientists and writers, the defenders of the lie use d isinformation, defamation, and slander to try and contain the truth and prevent it from spreading like wildfire. ISRAELI PRIOR KNOWLEDGE While the evidence indicates that the Israelis had prior knowledge of 9 - 11, commonly - held misconceptions about Isra el and a general lack of understanding of Zionism's brutal history of terrorism prevent most people from comprehending the Israeli connection. An ignorance of Zionist history, cultivated by the controlled media, prevents people from understanding the pres ent reality. In order to understand 9 - 11, it is essential to have a grasp of the history of previous Israeli attacks on the United States. This chapter examines a few little - known, but key events in the history of Israeli false - flag terror attacks and the Zionist planners behind them. The names and events discussed in this chapter are at the center of Zionist terrorism, false - flag and otherwise. \"False - flag\" terrorism means an act of terror planned and perpetrated by one party for the purpose of having t he blame assigned to its enemy for political or strategic purposes. 9 - 11, like many of the terror attacks that have occurred in occupied - Iraq, was a textbook false - flag operation. False - flag attacks are designed to foment hostility or instigate war betwe en groups or nations. Only very rarely has the United States, oceans away from the conflicts of Europe and Asia, actually been attacked by foreign militaries. The British invasion during the War of 1812 and the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 ar e the only two foreign attacks, prior to 9 - 11, that come to mind. Although 9 - 11 is disguised and interpreted by the government and media as an act of terrorism carried out by Islamic fanatics, the evidence indicates that it was a carefully planned false - f lag attack carried out by the Israeli military after years of planning and preparation. EVIDENCE OF ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com This is not a hypothesis that can be easily dismissed as based on mere speculation or prejudice. There is solid evidence that Israel i intelligence agencies had prior knowledge of 9 - 11, which is indicative of involvement in the attacks. Public statements made by key terror suspects, the five jubilant \"movers\" arrested in New Jersey, for example, who were actually Israeli intelligence a gents, indicate that they possessed prior knowledge of the attacks. In November 2001, after two months in U.S. custody, three of the five agents appeared on Israeli television and admitted, in plain Hebrew, that their purpose had been to document the even t. The Israeli interviewer did not ask the men who had sent them, but it is quite clear they were working for Israeli intelligence. Three of the five Israeli agents appeared on television when they were sent back to Israel and openly admitted that their \"purpose had been to document the event.\" The five fake movers from Urban Moving Systems of Weehawken, New Jersey, were actually operatives of the Israeli secret services. The five Israeli agents, described in early news reports as \"Middle Eastern,\" had b een sought by the FBI and New Jersey authorities after they had been seen celebrating and photographing the destruction of the World Trade Center. The Israelis made a video of themselves with the burning towers behind them as they flicked their cigarette lighters, laughed, and celebrated as hundreds of innocent people were being roasted alive. Reportedly, they had worn Palestinian or Arab garb, which was later found in their van. Two of the five Israelis, who were caught with multiple passports, box cutte rs, thousands of dollars stuffed into their socks, and driving a van that tested positive for explosives, were actually on a list of foreign intelligence agents known to U.S. law enforcement authorities at the time. ABC News did a follow up on the Israeli agents in June 2002: The arresting officers said they saw a lot that aroused their suspicion about the men. One of the passengers had $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock. Another was carrying two foreign passports. A box cutter was found in the van. But per haps the biggest surprise for the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com officers came when the five men identified themselves as Israeli citizens. ̳We Are Not Your Problem‘ According to the police report, one of the passengers told the officers they had been on the West Side Highway in Manh attan \"during the incident\" — referring to the World Trade Center attack. The driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers, \"We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem.\" The other passe ngers were his brother Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner, and Omer Marmari. The five \"movers\" were evidently part of a much larger Israeli terror operation in New York City. The Urban Moving Systems company was later exposed as a Mossad \"front\" com pany, a fake agency set up to facilitate their terror operation. An American who worked with the company said he was shocked to see that the Israeli employees had openly rejoiced over the attacks. In November 2001, the five Israeli agents and terror suspe cts were returned to Israel on \"visa violations\" although they first repeatedly refused to take, and then failed lie detector tests concerning their involvement in 9 - 11. Instant messages warning of the attack at the WTC, predicting the event to the precis e minute, sent via the Mossad - owned Odigo messaging system hours before the first plane hit the North Tower, are further evidence that members of Israeli intelligence agencies had very specific and accurate knowledge of the terror attacks – long before the y occurred. In a complex and elaborately planned crime of mass murder and terrorism like 9 - 11, possession of specific prior knowledge like that held by the fake Israeli movers and the senders of the Odigo messages is clearly evidence of involvement in th e crime. Had the recipients of the Odigo warnings contacted the responsible authorities in New York City, thousands of lives would have been saved. If these people were not complicit in the crime, why didn't they contact the authorities? Taking the ev idence of Israeli prior knowledge into consideration with the Israeli military's capability to launch such a sophisticated false - flag terror attack, the obvious question has to be asked: Would Israeli military agencies commit such an atrocious act of terr orism in the United States in order to achieve a strategic goal? The question whether Israeli strategic planners would conduct a false - flag terror attack against the United States, their most powerful ally, in order to fix the blame on the Arabs, their e nemies, raises several specific questions: 1. Has the Israeli military conducted false - flag terror attacks against the United States in the past? 2. If so, are there links between the people or agencies involved in the previous terror attacks and 9 - 11?"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com 3. Is there a strategic goal for which Zionist planners would conduct such an extremely dangerous and sophisticated terrorist operation? 4. If so, has that strategic goal been realized as a result of 9 - 11? The answer to all four questions i s yes. The Israeli military has a documented history of conducting military and false - flag terror attacks against the United States. It also has a history of withholding information from the United States about threats that it has knowledge of. Specific Zionist extremists are, furthermore, the prime suspects with the strongest motive for having carried out 9 - 11. The Zionist motive was to kick - start their long - planned U.S. - led \"War on Terror\" with a spectacular terror attack against the United States. Li ke any other crime, solving 9 - 11 requires that we diligently investigate those suspects with strong motives and prior histories of committing similar crimes. There are a number of senior Israeli suspects who fit this description. On the other hand, there is no reasonable Arab motive to attack the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. Why would Arabs or Moslems commit such a counter - productive act? Why would any Arab organization commit a senseless crime knowing that it would invite a U.S. military invasion of their nation or another Islamic nation? The Arab/Islamic terror scenario makes very little sense. ISRAEL'S HISTORY OF TERROR We must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation, and the cutting of all social services to rid the Galilee of its Arab population. - David Ben Gurion, first prime minister of Israel, to the General Staff, May 1948 Zionists and Israelis, on the other hand, have long employed terrorism as a tool and a tactic. Senior officials of the Israeli government, t he Mossad, and Israeli military intelligence, an organization known as AMAN, have a long history of using terror as a tool. Zionist immigrants from Poland and Russia used terrorism to drive the native population of Palestine from their land, homes, and vi llages during the war of 1947 - 48. Some 400 Palestinian villages and towns were obliterated and their populations killed or sent into exile as refugees. Many of the Palestinian houses and villages were taken over by Jewish immigrants; others were razed to the ground. The Zionists also began using terrorism as a tactic against the West in the 1940s, carrying out false - flag terror attacks against the United States and Britain as far back as the bombing of Jerusalem's King David Hotel on July 22, 1946. The bombing of the luxury hotel was ordered by Menachem Begin, the head of the Irgun, a Zionist terrorist organization during the 1930s and 1940s. Begin, a terrorist and avowed racist, later became prime minister of Israel, a position he held during the 1982 i nvasion of Lebanon, which was led by Ariel Sharon, then minister of defense. Begin had a Jewish supremacist view of the world, which he used to justify his crimes of terrorism and genocide. \"[The Palestinians] are beasts walking on two legs,\" Begin, then Prime Minister Begin, said in a speech to the Knesset, as quoted by the Israeli"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com writer Amnon Kapeliouk in his article \"Begin and the Beasts\" published in the New Statesman of June 25, 1982.

Irgun and Haganah terrorists, disguised as Arabs, set off seven large demolition bom bs in the basement of the King David Hotel, which was the base for the British Secretariat and the military command in British - occupied Palestine. Ninety - one people were killed, most of them staff of the secretariat. The attack on the hotel was the deadli est attack against the British in the history of the Mandate. To this day, the Zionist bombing of the King David Hotel is the terrorist act which has caused the greatest number of casualties in the history of the Israeli - Arab conflict. Zionist extremists, however, are proud of the terrorist bombing as one of their actions that compelled the British to give up the Mandate over Palestine. David Ben Gurion, the head of the Haganah militia who advocated the use of terror as a tool, supported the bombing. Alth ough the Haganah publicly condemned the bombing afterwards, many researchers insist that the Haganah directly authorized the bombing. \"Everything was coordinated with the Haganah,\" former prime minister and Irgun leader Menachem Begin declared in a film c lip from the Israel Broadcasting Authority's \"Scroll of Fire\" series. \"We must use terror,\" Israel's first prime minister David Ben Gurion (on left) told the General"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Staff in 1948.

NETANYAHU'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISTS Members of the Irgun, which carried out scores of terror bombings in the 1930s and 40s (and its political successors in the Likud party) hold the world view that \"political violence and terrorism\" are \"legitimate tools in the Jewish national struggle fo r the Land of Israel,\" according to Arie Perliger and Leonard Weinberg, authors of \"Jewish Self Defense and Terrorist Groups Prior to the Establishment of the State of Israel: Roots and Traditions.\" In July 2006, the former prime minister and leader of t he Likud, Benjamin Netanyahu, attended a two - day 60th anniversary celebration of the King David Hotel bombing with former terrorists of the Irgun and Haganah. The event was organized by the Menachem Begin Heritage House, the University of Haifa, and the A ssociation of IZL [Irgun] Fighters. The seminar was held \"to mark the 60th anniversary of the bombing of the King David Hotel, Jerusalem, by members of the United Resistance Movement (Haganah and Irgun),\" the Jerusalem Post noted in its pre - event notices. The Israeli newspaper specifically noted that members of the Haganah and Irgun had been involved in the terrorist bombing. One of the terrorists even led a tour of the hotel he had bombed. The fact that the American - educated right - wing politician and te rror specialist, \"Bibi\" Netanyahu, had participated in a two - day event celebrating the bombing of the King David Hotel was reported in the Jerusalem Post , and in leading newspapers in Britain, France, and India – but not a single word about the event was p rinted in the controlled press of the United States, the nation supposedly fighting a \"War on Terror.\""},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com \"It's very good,\" said Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 - 11 about the attacks which were thought to have killed more than 10,000 Americans. Netanyahu's conspicuo us role as the main speaker at an event celebrating an act of terrorism was not reported in any U.S. newspaper until Patrick Buchanan mentioned it in his article entitled \"Moral Culpability for Qana,\" on August 2, 2006. Buchanan's comments, however, appea red only in independent regional newspapers in Pittsburgh, Wyoming, and Ohio: Rubbing our noses in our own cravenness, \"Bibi\" Netanyahu took time out a week ago to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the terror attack on the King David Hotel by Menachem Be gin's Irgun, an attack that killed 92 people, among them British nurses.

And those children in Qana should not have ignored Israeli leaflets warning them to clear out of southern Lebanon. Our Israeli friends appear to be playing us for fools. \"TERRORISTS IN DISGUISE\" In 1946, The Times (U.K.) described the Irgun as \"terrorists in disguise.\" Sarah Agassi, 80, was one of the \"terrorists in disguise\" involved in the bombing of the King David Hotel, it reported. She and a fellow agent had cased out the hotel. Her brother and other terrorists had disguised themselves as Arabs delivering milk and brought seven milk cans, each containing 50 kg. (110 lbs.) of explosives, into the basement of the hotel. There were important strategic reasons for the bombing, according to the Jerusalem Post of July 27, 2006:"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The bombing was a direct response to the events of the British Oper ation Agatha and the Black Sabbath of June 29, 1946, during which 17,000 British soldiers confiscated weapons and intelligence documents and arrested thousands of leaders of the Yishuv and Hagana activists. The documents, brought to the King David headqu arters, revealed most of the Yishuv's operational plans and incriminated the Jewish Agency in the leadership of the United Resistance, as well as the IZL and the Lehi, against the British. The evidence would be used to try the Jewish activists and, quite possibly, to hang them. Twenty - five fighters took part in the carefully - planned and precisely executed bombing. Six of them, dressed as Arab laborers, placed the seven milk cans filled with 350 kg. of explosives, fitted with timers set to go off in 40 m inutes, around the central support beam of the hotel's southern wing. Others spread explosives along the roads leading to the hotel to prevent reinforcements and emergency medical crews from arriving at the scene. NETANYAHU'S TERRORIST ROOTS Netanyahu is the son of Ben Zion Netanyahu (born Mileikowsky in Warsaw, Poland). Ben Zion was the former senior aide of Vladimir \"Ze'ev\" Jabotinsky, the militant extremist founder of Revisionist Zionism and the Irgun. His son, Benjamin \"Bibi\" Netanyahu is also a lead ing advocate of the teachings of Jabotinsky. On July 8, 2007, Netanyahu was the keynote speaker at an event at the Jabotinsky Institute to mark the 67th anniversary of the death of the founder of the Irgun. The Irgun, a Zionist terrorist organization de dicated to creating Greater Israel, is the political parent of Israel's extreme right - wing Likud party, which Benjamin Netanyahu currently heads. The Irgun was the \"armed expression\" of Revisionist Zionism, which was expressed by Jabotinsky as follows, ac cording to Howard M. Sachar, author of A History of Israel from the Rise of Zionism to Our Time : 1. Every Jew has the right to enter Palestine; 2. Only active retaliation [i.e. terrorism] would deter the Arabs and the British; 3. Only Jewish a rmed force would ensure the Jewish state. TERRORISM SPECIALIST Netanyahu is also a terrorism specialist who has made a career out of promoting the Zionist agenda of a global \"War on Terror\" since the early 1980s. On September 11, 2001, the New York Tim es asked Netanyahu what he thought of the attacks: \"It's very good,\" Netanyahu said. Who else, but a hardened terrorist involved in the crime, would use the word \"good\" to describe 9 - 11?"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com As James Bennet of the New York Times reported on September 12, 2 001: Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, replied, \"It's very good.\" Then he edited himself: \"Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.\" I n 2006, the Jerusalem Post and other newspapers reported on Netanyahu's outspoken support for the terrorists who had bombed the King David Hotel in 1946. The Irgun's chief of operations at the time of the bombing was Eitan Livni, the father of the Israeli Foreign Minister \"Tzipi\" Livni (2006 - 09). The high - level political connections in Israel with the Irgun terrorists of the 1940s are an indication of the degree of terrorist influence on the Israeli political establishment, The Hindu [India] wisely noted in an article entitled \"Celebrating Terror, Israeli - style\" on July 24, 2006: \"We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated,\" Britain's Ambassador to Israel, Simon Mc Donald, and its consul - general in Jerusalem, John Jenkins, protested weakly in a letter to the local Israeli administration in Jerusalem. PREVIOUS ISRAELI ATTACKS ON U.S. TARGETS Eight years after the bombing of the King David Hotel, the State of Israel carried out a series of false - flag terror bombings against U.S. and British libraries, theatres, and other government institutions in Egypt in a terror campaign designed to be blamed on Egyptian groups. This Israeli terror campaign of July 1954 is often r eferred to as the \"Lavon Affair\" after Pinhas Lavon, the Israeli defense minister at the time. In June 1967, thirteen years after the Lavon Affair, the Israeli air force and navy deliberately strafed, bombed, napalmed, and torpedoed an unarmed U.S. vessel , the USS Liberty , and tried to kill all of the nearly three hundred crew members, simply to achieve a strategic war - time goal. Recently released documents from the National Security Agency (NSA) confirm that the United States government at the time had e vidence that the Israelis had deliberately attacked the USS Liberty knowing it was a U.S. vessel. Oliver Kirby, the NSA's deputy director for operations at the time of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty , confirmed the existence of the transcripts to Jo hn Crewdson of the Chicago Tribune , saying he had personally read them: Asked whether he had personally read such transcripts, Kirby replied, \"I sure did. I certainly did.\" \"They said, 'We've got him in the zero,'\" Kirby recalled, \"whatever that meant -- I guess the sights or something. And then one of them said, 'Can you see the flag?' They said 'Yes, it's U.S, it's U.S.' They said it several times, so there wasn't any doubt in anybody's mind that they knew it.\" "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Kirby, now 86 and retired in Texas, sa id the transcripts were \"something that's bothered me all my life.

In 1985, he founded an un - named security company, accord ing to his obituary in the Guardian (UK) from June 2003. From 1987 until retirement in 1993, he was the chairman of Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI). ICTS, the Israeli airport passenger screening and security firm, is a key defendant in the 9 - 11 litigati on. The ICTS website says this about the company: \"ICTS International N.V. was founded in 1982 by a select group of security experts, former military commanding officers and veterans of government intelligence and security agencies.\" An employee of ICTS told me in 2001 that Huntleigh USA, their wholly owned airport security subsidiary, had handled passenger screening at Boston and Newark airports on 9 - 11.

The Israeli airline security firm went through a number of name changes as it began providing \"securit y\" to European and American airports. Moshe Dayan, defense minister during the Six - Day War, was a close associate and political ally of Shimon Peres. In 1965, former prime minister Ben Gurion and his closest followers, including Shimon Peres and Moshe Day an, broke away from the ruling labor party, Mapai, and formed a separate minority faction, the Rafi or Workers' List. COVER - UP The U.S. government, military, and media all went along with the cover - up of the deliberate attack on the USS Liberty to avoi d blaming Israel for the murder of 34 American servicemen, 26 of whom died from the torpedo blast, and the wounding of some 173 others. Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, certainly knows who made the decision to attack the U.S. vessel in 1967. The Main Battle Dressing Station on the USS Liberty was described as a ―bloody scene reminiscent of the American Civil War.‖ The Israeli torpedo and machine guns took a terrible toll on the Liberty‘s crew, killing 34 and wounding 172."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The Crewdson article reveal s that the Israelis knew very well that the USS Liberty was an American vessel in international waters – before they fired the torpedo that killed twenty - six U.S. servicemen in one fell swoop: Twenty minutes later, after the Liberty had been hit repeatedly by machine guns, 30 mm cannon and napalm from the Israelis' French - built Mirage and Mystere fighter - bombers, the controller directing the attack asked his chief in Tel Aviv to which country the target vessel belonged. \"Apparently American,\" the chief co ntroller replied. Fourteen minutes later the Liberty was struck amidships by a torpedo from an Israeli boat, killing 26 of the 100 or so NSA technicians and specialists in Russian and Arabic who were working in restricted compartments below the ship's wa terline. The Israeli torpedo killed 26 U.S. servicemen and left a hole 39 feet across. \"SINK THE TARGET – NO SURVIVORS\" Lt. James M. Ennes, Jr., an officer on the bridge of the USS Liberty , wrote his first - hand account of the Israeli attack in a 1979 b ook entitled Assault on the Liberty . Lieutenant Ennes' book is documentary evidence that the Israeli attack was deliberate and not an accident of war. Ennes describes how Israeli torpedo boats repeatedly machine - gunned Liberty sailors fighting the napalm fires on deck and shot her life rafts in the water while an oversize U.S. flag flew from its mast. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The shooting of the life rafts indicates that the Israelis did not want anyone to survive the assault and intended sinking of the U.S. vessel. Steve Forslu nd, an intelligence analyst for the 544th Air Reconnaissance Technical Wing in 1967, saw the transcripts from the Israeli pilots and their ground control as they came off the teletype machine at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha. \"The ground control station stated that the target was American and for the aircraft to confirm it,\" Forslund recalled. \"The aircraft did confirm the identity of the target as American, by the American flag. The ground control station ordered the aircraft to attack and sink the tar get and ensure they left no survivors.\" Forslund said he clearly recalled \"the obvious frustration of the controller over the inability of the pilots to sink the target quickly and completely.\" \"He kept insisting the mission had to sink the target, and was frustrated with the pilots' responses that it didn't sink.\" Chief Petty Officer Stanley W. White, president of the Liberty Veterans Association, said, \"The Israeli planes and gunboats spent more than one hour hitting us with rockets, napalm bombs, to rpedoes, cannon and machine - gun fire. They machine - gunned our firefighters on deck and they shot our life rafts out of the water...I don't know of a single member of our association who believes that attack was an accident.\" There are three reasons that ha ve been given as to why the Israelis wanted to sink the U.S. electronic reconnaissance vessel: 1. To prevent the U.S. from knowing that Israel was planning to seize the Golan Heights from Syria; 2. To prevent the U.S. from obtaining evidence that I sraeli troops were slaughtering some 1,000 Egyptian prisoners of war near Gaza; 3. To destroy the U.S. vessel that was capable of discerning that Israel was sending false communications to Jordan and Egypt to keep them in the war until the Israeli mil itary achieved its territorial goals on the ground. \"U.S. intelligence documents indicate the Israelis attacked the Liberty deliberately. They feared she would monitor their plans to attack the Golan Heights in Syria - a move the United States opposed for fear of provoking Soviet military intervention,\" James Ennes said. Wilber Crane Eveland, an author formerly with the CIA in the Middle East, wrote that the Liberty had intercepted messages that \"made it clear that Israel had never intended to limit its a ttack to Egypt.\" ISRAELI MASSACRE OF EGYPTIAN POWS The Tribune article reported that the NSA's deputy director at the time, Louis Tordella, speculated in a recently declassified memo that the attack \"might have been ordered by some senior commander on the Sinai Peninsula who wrongly suspected that the Liberty was"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com monitoring his activities.\" The activities that needed to be hidden included the slaughter of some 1,000 Egyptian POWs. Aryeh Yitzhaki of Bar Ilan University, who had worked in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) history department, said in an August 1995 interview with Israel Radio that a reconnaissance unit, known as Shaked (Almond), headed by Binyamin Ben - Eliezer, had killed hundreds of Egyptians who had abandoned their weapons and fled into the desert during the 1967 war. Yitzhaki said he had investigated six or seven separate incidents, in which approximately 1,000 unarmed Egyptian prisoners of war had been killed by IDF units. THE BOMBING OF THE U.S. MARINE BARRACKS - BEIRUT 1983 Sixteen years later, 241 U.S. Marines died when a Mercedes truck packed with explosives demolished their barracks at Beirut International Airport on October 23, 1983. A similar explosion occu rred nearly simultaneously at the French military barracks a few kilometers away, killing 56 French troops. In the wake of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Ronald Reagan sent 1,800 marines to Beirut to act as \"peace keepers.\" Ariel Sharon and the Israeli leadership, however, resented the interference and used the U.S. presence to commit a false - flag operation that killed 241 marines, according to Victor Ostrovsky in his book on the Mossad, By Way of Deception . Ostrovsky, a former Mossad o fficer, reported that Nahum Admoni, the Mossad director at the time, had very specific information about the truck being prepared for the attack on the U.S. Marines, but had intentionally withheld this crucial information from the U.S. military. \"No, we'r e not there to protect Americans. They're a big country. Send only the regular information,\" Admoni reportedly said. Admoni, the son of Polish immigrants, was director of the Mossad from 1982 to 1989. In 1947 - 48, Admoni had served in the Shai, the Hagana h intelligence branch headed by Isser Harel, and later in the newly created IDF Intelligence, Aman. After the 1948 war, Admoni studied at the University of California, Berkeley, until 1954. The purpose of the false flag terror bombings in Lebanon was to c reate U.S. animosity toward the Arab world and align the U.S. with Israel, according to Ostrovsky. There had been an earlier car bomb at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut on April 18, 1983, which had killed seventeen Marines. The bombing compelled the Marines to move offshore and President Reagan ordered them to be withdrawn from Lebanon on February 7, 1984. The Beirut bombing was the deadliest single - day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima. Israeli intelligence is suspec ted of having been involved in the bombings in Lebanon. \"WAR ON TERROR\" "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The ultimate goal of creating U.S. animosity toward the Arab world is the Zionist mega - fraud known as the \"War on Terror.\" With its U.S. - led invasions and occupations of Afghanist an and Iraq, the \"War on Terror\" is the realization of an important strategic goal for Israeli military planners. To have the armies of the U.S. and European nations occupying Iraq, the most powerful and advanced Arab nation, has always been the dream of Zionist strategic planners. Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, has explicitly called for such a global \"War on Terror\" since the early 1980s. Although it is never mentioned as such in the controlled press, it needs to be understood that the \"War on Terror\" with its pre - planned invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, constitutes a war of aggression. To prepare for and carry out a war of aggression is a serious war crime, i.e. a Crime against Peace under the Nuremberg Principles of 1950. The United States and it s allies convicted and literally strangled to death dozens of senior Nazis at the Nuremberg trials for having committed such war crimes. In the aftermath of 9 - 11, the U.S. government failed to prove that the terror attacks had been planned, sponsored, or executed by members of the ruling Taliban regime prior to invading Afghanistan. Years after invading that nation, the U.S. government has yet to prove that any link existed between the Taliban regime and 9 - 11. On June 5, 2006, author Ed Haas contacted t he Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters to ask why, while claiming that Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 1998 bombings of US Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, the \"most wanted\" poster does not indicate that Bin Laden is wanted in co nnection with the events of 9 - 11. Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI responded, ―The reason why 9 - 11 is not mentioned on Osama bin Laden‘s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9 - 11.‖ Tomb con tinued, ―Bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection to 9 - 11.‖ Likewise, there is no evidence of involvement in 9 - 11 by any member of the regime of the former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, allegations that the Iraqi regime had obta ined weapons of mass destruction, trumpeted by senior officials of the Bush administration and Judith Miller of the New York Times , turned out to be lies crafted solely for the purpose of deceiving the public and provoking another illegal invasion. The pa ssage of time does not make a war of aggression and occupation any less illegal. DECADES OF PLANNING There are key people involved in the 1954 Israeli terror bombings of the U.S. Information Agency libraries in Alexandria and Cairo who held high - level positions in the Israeli government of 2001. There are other Israelis, with long histories of terrorism and strategic planning, who revealed having very specific prior knowledge of 9 - 11 long before 2001. The highest Israeli intelligence official at the time of the Lavon Affair, Isser Harel, was evidently aware of the long - term planning of 9 - 11 -- more than twenty years before it happened. In 1980,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com twenty - one years before September 11, 2001, Isser Harel, the former director of Haganah intelligence, the Shin Bet (internal) and the Mossad (foreign) intelligence services, predicted with uncanny accuracy the events of 9 - 11 to Michael D. Evans, an American supporter of Zionist extremists of the Jabotinsky sort. On September 23, 1980, Evans visited Harel at his home in Israel and had dinner with him and Dr. Reuven Hecht, a senior adviser to then prime minister Menachem Begin. Isser Harel, Israeli spymaster and master terrorist, discussed his knowledge of the plan to bomb the WTC -- in 1980. \"AMERICA THE T ARGET\" In an editorial entitled \"America the Target,\" published in the Jerusalem Post of September 30, 2001, Evans related what Harel had told him: I sat with former Mossad chief Isser Harel for a conversation about Arab terrorism. As he handed me a cup of hot tea and a plate of cookies, I asked him, \"Do you think terrorism will come to America, and if so, where and why?\" Harel looked at his American visitor and replied, \"I fear it will come to you in America. America has the power, but not the will, to fight terrorism. The terrorists have the will, but not the power, to fight America - but all that could change with time.

Evans: The story of prophecy that has to do with the Jews goes all the way through to the end of the Book of Revelation. Jesus prophesied in Matthew 24.

On Sept. 23, 1979, the founder of Israeli intelligence ov er dinner told me that America was developing a tolerance for terror. The gentleman's name was Isser Harel, the founder of Mossad Israeli intelligence -- he ran it from 1947 to 1963.

He said if the tolerance continued that Islamic fundamentalists would ultimately strike America. I said \"Where?\" He said, \"In Islamic theology, the phallic symbol is very important. Your biggest phallic symbol is New York City and your tallest building will be the phallic symbol they will hit.\" Isser Harel prophesied that the tallest building in New York would be the first building hit by Islamic fundamentalists 21 years ago.

The founder of Is raeli intelligence tells an American Zionist in 1980 that Arab terrorism will come to America and that the terrorists will strike the tallest building in New York City. His bizarre prediction, which makes no sense, then comes to pass thirteen years later w ith a hapless and thoroughly fake attack in 1993, evidently set up by the FBI. The FBI - coordinated false - flag terror event is followed, eight years later, by a spectacular, well - planned, and extremely lethal attack which kills thousands. How did Isser Ha rel know what the Arab terrorists had planned more than two decades before 9 - 11? ISSER HAREL – MOSSAD'S MASTER TERRORIST Under David Ben Gurion, Isser Harel was the former chief of Haganah intelligence (Shai) from 1944, the Shin Bet from 1948, and the Mo ssad until 1963. Admoni, the Mossad director who refused to warn the U.S. Marines in 1983, had served under Harel. Given his unique position and penchant for terrorism as a means of coercion, the uncanny accuracy of Harel's prediction says more about the years of Israeli planning that went into 9 - 11 than it does about any criminal plots of alleged Arab origin. After nearly two decades as the head of Israeli intelligence, Ben Gurion reportedly asked Harel to resign in 1963 because of his use of terrorism bombings as a means of coercion against the West. Harel, as director of the Mossad, had initiated \"The Damocles Operation\" of the early 1960s, which was a terror bombing campaign to threaten German scientists to prevent them from helping Egypt develop its defense systems. Isser Harel, head of Israeli intelligence in 1961 Two Mossad agents were arrested and jailed in Switzerland for using terror bombs against German scientists.

On 7 October Harel [Isser Harel, Mossad head] left for Europe 'to personally supervise authorized operations and the special collec tion programme.' In November, Aman [IDF intelligence] sent several letter bombs to the rocket installations in Egypt and one of them, a large parcel that had been mailed by sea from Hamburg, killed five Egyptians. Someone with a black sense of humour dub bed the campaign 'post mortem.' It is interesting to note that Yosef Goell, a columnist with the Jerusalem Post , published an editorial entitled \"Isser Harel and the German Scientists\" on February 22, 1991, in which Israel's English - language newspaper delivered a thinly - veiled threat of Harel - type terrorism to European scientists and companies doing business with Arab nations: The directors and managers of those firms and the experts who work for them should be reminded that they are playing with their lives and the welfare of their families. It would be well if they went back and studied the episode of Isser Harel and the German scientists in Nasser's missile program of the 1960s. THE LAVON AFFAIR The Lavon Affair, or \"the shameful affair\" (Esek Habis h) as it is known in Hebrew, was an Israeli false - flag terror bombing campaign against the United States and Britain that was carried out in Egypt in 1954. Israeli military intelligence had set up a terror cell of sleeper agents in Egypt, which was activa ted in July 1954 to blow up U.S. and British targets. The Israeli operation was code - named \"Susannah.\" The false - flag terrorist bombings were meant to be blamed on Egyptians in order to alienate the U.S. and Britain from President Gamal Abdul Nasser and p revent Egypt from nationalizing the Suez Canal. The Lavon Affair is seldom discussed in the media or in university courses on Middle Eastern history. Strict censorship in the Israeli media even prevented the Israeli public from knowing about the affair for many years. Only in 2005, fifty - one years after the bombings, did Israel finally admit responsibility for its 1954 false - flag terrorist bombing campaign in Egypt. The false - flag terror bombings were carried out between July 2 and July 27, 1954 by a c overt terror cell composed of about one dozen Egyptian Jews under the command of Israeli intelligence agents. The Israeli - run terror cell was discovered and broken up on July 27, 1954, when one of its members was caught in Alexandria after the bomb he wa s carrying exploded. An Israeli terrorist cell, Unit 131, was reportedly responsible for the terror bombings. At the time of the incident, Unit 131 is said to have been the subject of a dispute between Aman and Mossad over who"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com controlled it. How conveni ent. The Egyptian operatives had been recruited several years before, when an Israeli intelligence officer named Avram Dar went to Cairo posing as John Darling, a British citizen from Gibraltar. Dar recruited Egyptian Jews, who had helped the Mossad with illegal emigration to Israel, and trained them for covert operations. The Israeli terror cell went to work in the summer of 1954. On July 2, a post office in Alexandria was firebombed. On July 14, the U.S. Information Agency libraries in Alexandria and Cairo and a British theater were bombed. The bombs contained nitroglycerine and were placed on the shelves of the libraries. After the terrorist cell was discovered, three of the Israeli terrorist commanders succeeded in fleeing Egypt and the fourth commi tted suicide. After the trial in Cairo, two of the accused Egyptian Jews were condemned to death and executed, and eight were condemned to long terms of imprisonment. MOSHE SHARETT The Israeli prime minister and foreign minister at the time, Moshe Sha rett, was evidently unaware of the intrigue, which had apparently been carried out by disciples of David Ben Gurion, namely Isser Harel, Moshe Dayan, and Shimon Peres. Sharett (born Shertok in Cherson, Ukraine) was Israel's first foreign minister (May 15, 1948 – June 18, 1956) and second prime minister (Dec. 7, 1953 – Nov. 2, 1955). Sharett held both positions at the time of the Israeli terror campaign. Sharett, who appears to have known nothing about the terror ring, only became informed of the facts aft erwards. In October 1953, shortly before Ben Gurion took a two - year hiatus in the Negev Desert leaving Sharett in charge, he appointed Pinhas Lavon, a staunch supporter of the \"retaliation\" [i.e. terrorism] policy, as minister of defense, and nominated M oshe Dayan as chief of staff of the armed forces. When Sharett was told of Ben Gurion's decision to nominate Dayan as chief of staff, he penned this note in his diary: \"The new chief of staff's immense capacity for plotting and intrigue - making will yield many complications.\" LAVON - TERRORIZE THE WEST Pinhas Lavon, Israel's minister of defense at the time of the terror bombings, was part of a group of military leaders who advocated the use of terrorism against the Western nations, particularly Britain and the United States. This group included the Polish - born immigrants David Ben Gurion and Shimon Peres (Szymon Persky), and Moshe Dayan, the kibbutznik son of Ukrainian immigrants. In January 1955, Sharett wrote about Lavon to Aharon Barkatt, secretar y general of the Mapai party: He [Lavon] inspired and cultivated the negative adventuristic trend in the army and preached the doctrine that not the Arab countries but the Western Powers are the enemy, and the only way to deter them from their plots is thr ough direct actions that will terrorize them."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com When the Israeli terrorist plot against Britain and the U.S. was exposed, Ben Gurion blamed Lavon, who, in turn, blamed Col. Benjamin Givli, another Ben Gurion protégé and the head of Aman, Israeli military int elligence. Lavon said that Givli had organized the covert operation behind his back. SHARETT & ISRAEL'S TERRORISM Prime Minister Sharett, however, had \"no doubts about the guilt of the Dayan - Peres - Givli clique,\" according to the late Israeli historian Livia Rokach, the daughter of Israel Rokach, the former mayor of Tel Aviv and minister of internal affairs in the Sharett government: For him [Sharett], the question of who gave the order was secondary to the necessity of pronouncing a judgment on the ide ology and politics of Israel's terrorism. Therefore, while he had no doubts about the guilt of the Dayan - Peres - Givli clique; to him Lavon's political responsibility was also inescapable. As Sharett wrote about Lavon on January 10, 1955: [People] ask me if I am convinced that \"he gave the order?\"... but let us assume that Givli has acted without instructions... doesn't the moral responsibility lie all the same on Lavon, who has constantly preached for acts of madness and taught the army leadership the diabolic l esson of how to set the Middle East on fire, how to cause friction, cause bloody confrontations, sabotage targets and property of the Powers [and perform] acts of despair and suicide?\" As a \"moderate Zionist,\" Sharett believed that Israel's survival would be impossible without the support of the West, Rokach wrote, but that Western \"morality\" and interests in the Middle East would not support a Jewish state which \"behaves according to the laws of the jungle\" and \"raises terrorism to the level of a sacred pr inciple.\" SHIMON PERES: \"FRIGHTEN THE WEST\" In May 1947, Ben Gurion drafted Shimon Peres into the Haganah high command, where he was initially put in charge of manpower and later became involved in arms procurement and production. Peres served as chie f of the naval department in 1948 and was sent to the United States in 1950 on an arms procurement mission. Peres was instrumental in acquiring weapons for the Haganah and establishing the Israeli defense industries, especially the aircraft and avionics i ndustries, according to his biography. He is also known as the godfather of the Israel's high - tech defense industries and illegal nuclear arsenal. Peres built an alliance with France that secured a source of arms, and was responsible for the program to d evelop nuclear weapons for Israel, convincing the French to help Israel build a secret nuclear reactor at Dimona in the Negev Desert in 1957. It was Peres who acquired the French advanced Dassault Mirage III jet fighters that the Israeli air force used to attack the USS Liberty in 1967. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com About Shimon Peres, whom Sharett considered to be one of the key planners of the terror bombing campaign of U.S. institutions in Egypt, he wrote this note in 1955: \"Peres shares the same ideology [as Lavon]: he wants to frighten the West into supporting Israel's aims.\" Two years later, in 1957, Sharett wrote even more critically about Peres: I have stated that I totally and utterly reject Peres and consider his rise to prominence a malignant, immoral disgrace. I will r end my clothes in mourning for the State if I see him become a minister in the Israeli government.

The immens e profits that have flowed into the coffers of Western drug and oil cartels as a consequence of the Anglo - American control over the opium production of occupied - Afghanistan and the oil of occupied - Iraq amply illustrate Rokach's point that Israeli false - fla g terror is \"capable of serving the cause of Western power politics in the region.\" As Rokach concluded in her study of Sharett's diary and documents: Just as Zionism, based on the de - Palestinization and the Judaisation of Palestine, was intrinsically ra cist and immoral, thus the West, in reality, had no use for a Jewish state in the Middle East which did not behave according to the laws of the jungle, and whose terrorism could not be relied on as a major instrument for the oppression of the peoples of th e region."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com By April 1957, Sharett realized that the hard - line terrorist faction headed by Ben Gurion and his protégés Dayan and Peres had won – and that he, and his vision of moderate Zionism, had lost: I go on repeating to myself nowadays, \"Admit that you are the loser!\" They showed much more daring and dynamism...they played with fire, and they won...The public, even your own public, does not share your position. On the contrary...the public now turns even against its \"masters\" and its bitterness against the ret reat [from Sinai and Gaza] is developing into a tendency to change the political balance in this country in favor of [the former Irgun terrorist leader Menachem] Begin. \"His [Sharett's] defeat in internal Israeli politics reflected the ascendancy of the po sitions of Ben Gurion, Dayan and others [Peres] who were not reluctant to use force to attain their goals,\" Noam Chomsky wrote in his forward to Rokach's book: His diaries give a very revealing picture of the developing conflict, as he perceived it, and o ffer an illuminating insight into the early history of the state of Israel, with ramifications that reach to the present, and beyond. 9 - 11 and the \"War on Terror\" are clearly two \"ramifications\" of the victory of the terrorist Zionists that \"reach to the p resent.\" Had Moshe Sharett, the Israeli prime minister, \"spoken frankly and directly to public opinion\" and torn up \"the mask of secrecy\" surrounding the Israeli terror bombings, he could have changed the history of the Middle East, Rokach wrote: At this point, Sharett could have changed the history of the Middle East had he spoken frankly and directly to public opinion, which was deeply troubled by the events in Egypt: the arrests, the trial, the executions, the contradicting rumors, the climate of intri gue surrounding the \"Affair.\" [By] tearing up the mask of secrecy, denouncing those who were responsible, exposing his true convictions in regard to Israel's terroristic ideologies and orientations, [and] proposing an alternative, he could have created for himself the conditions in which to use the formal powers that he possessed to make a radical housecleaning in the security establishment. The impact of such an act would have probably been considerable not only in Israel itself but also in the Arab world, especially in Egypt. The downfall of Lavon on one hand and of the Ben Gurionist gang, headed by Dayan and Peres, on the other hand might have blocked Ben Gurion's return to power, and in the longer range, the Sinai - Suez war. Events since then would have t aken a different course. Unfortunately, \"the Ben Gurionist gang, headed by Dayan and Peres\" came to power. Peres, who had served in high - level appointed positions, was elected to the Knesset in the 1959 elections. Peres, the former Director General of th e Ministry of Defense under Moshe Dayan, then became the Deputy Defense Minister, a position he held until 1965 when he was implicated, with Dayan, in the Lavon affair.

Yitzhak Rabin was chief of staff and Moshe Dayan was minister of defense during this crucial war that reshaped the Middle East.

Dayan and Peres had worked closely together since their days in the Haganah. SHIMON PERES: TERRORIST - IN - CHIEF Shimon Peres, a most unsuitable recipient of the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, has a long history of terrorism, which is evidently not well known in the West. Peres, the octogenarian president of the State of Israel, has a documented record of involvement in terrorist crimes over a period of more than five decades. Condoleezza Rice visits Shimon Peres, September 2007 Peres is a survivor of the struggle among Zionists between the militant hard - liners, who promoted the use of violence and terrorism, versus the softer \"moderates,\" who opposed terrorism and advocated the use of diplomacy. Shimon Peres is a hard - liner. Bo rn Szymon Persky in Wiszniew, Poland, on August 2, 1923, Peres is the first cousin of Lauren Bacall, the Brooklyn - born Betty Joan Persky. This relationship between the veteran hard - line Zionist and a Hollywood movie star is a good example of how Zionist J ewish families from the Pale of Settlement often established branches in Israel and the United States in the early 1900s. In 1947, the Polish - born Zionist leader David Ben Gurion (born David Grün) met Shimon Peres, then age twenty - three, at Haganah headq uarters and made him responsible for manpower and arms purchases for the underground Zionist militia Ben Gurion commanded in Palestine."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Ben Gurion and Shimon Peres (on left), 1969 Peres became a protégé of Ben Gurion. After the bombing of the King David Hotel and other terror killings by the Haganah and other Zionist terror gangs, the British withdrew from Palestine. The armed gangs of Zionist immigrants and veterans of the Red Army then turned their terrorist skills, which some had gained during World Wa r II, against the indigenous population of Palestine. Nearly 400 Palestinian towns and villages were completely obliterated or \"ethnically cleansed\" during the 1947 - 48 Zionist conquest of Palestine. Peres was also the chief of the Israeli navy, whose ma in task at the time was the illegal smuggling of men and arms for the Zionist forces in Palestine. When the war of 1947 - 1948 ended, Peres \"assumed the position of Director of the Defense Ministry's procurement delegation in the United States,\" according t o his biography. As director of arms procurement in the United States, Peres was responsible for organizing illegal arms smuggling. Transfers of weapons and planes to Zionist forces violated the U.S. Neutrality Act. Much of the Haganah arms smuggling ac tivity was run from an office above the \"syndicate - owned\" Copacabana Club in New York City, where Peres and Teddy Kollek, the Hungarian - born son of the director of the Rothschild bank in Vienna, worked closely with the \"crime syndicate\" headed by the leadi ng Jewish gangsters of the time.

It is interesting to note that Peres neve r attended university or served in the army, according to Ha'aretz (Israel) of June 14, 2007. As Director General, Peres was a founder of Israel's military and its subsidiary, Israel Aircraft Industries. Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, put Per es in charge of the establishment of the Israel's unlawful nuclear program and secret reactor at Dimona in the Negev Desert. Peres has never been very popular with Israeli voters. Although he served twice as prime minister, he was never elected to that position. In 2000, he even lost a parliamentary election for the presidency to Moshe Katsav, an Iranian Jewish immigrant. Peres served as Israel's foreign minister under the Likud right - wing Ariel Sharon from early 2001 until November 2002. In July 2007 , at nearly 84 years of age, Peres finally won the presidency, but only after Katsav was forced to leave office under a storm of allegations of rape and sexual misconduct. One might wonder why an eighty - four - year - old man would even want to be president. Is this an example of the maxim, \"no rest for the wicked?\" Is Peres still working because he needs to protect the critical secrets about 9 - 11 and the war agenda it launched? Oddly, prior to 9 - 11, Peres, a politician from the left, held the most powerful positions of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in a government led by a prime minister from the extreme right, Ariel Sharon. Sharon, reportedly comatose since January 2006, is a well known terrorist, war monger, and war criminal with a long reco rd of committing atrocities in Palestine and Lebanon. Peres held these highest level positions in the Israeli government from March 3, 2001 until November 2, 2002. Peres, godfather and chief architect of Israel's high tech military and unlawful nuclear arsenal, is a person who has always supported the use of terror to coerce the West to support Israel's strategic goals. He has been involved, at the highest level, in numerous covert false - flag terrorist operations, such as the Lavon Affair, which was eve n kept secret from the Israeli prime minister at the time.

May, form er U.S. Army military intelligence officer The past two decades have been marked by a large number of man - made terror events which remain unsolved to this day. Several of these events, which involve heinous crimes of mass murder, are similar in a most rema rkable way. These are the disasters which occurred during security drills or military exercises in which the scenario was incredibly similar, if not identical to the real - life terror attack. Understanding the nature of the exercises that created the back ground and framework for these attacks is essential to understanding how the attacks were carried out. The fact that these real - life terror events occurred within the context of virtually identical terrorism/security exercises has been completely ignored b y the media -- as if the exercises had never happened. Of the major terror events that occurred during such exercises, we"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com will look at three specific examples: the aerial attacks of 9 - 11, the bombings of the London Underground and a bus in 2005, and the si nking of the Baltic ferry Estonia in 1994. While there certainly have been other major disasters that occurred within the context of military exercises, the sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk in 2000, for example, and the 1988 downing of Iran Air Flig ht 655 by the USS Vincennes in the Persian Gulf, the three events being discussed here involved attacks on civilian transportation systems far from any war zone. The three disasters were all handled in the same way by their respective governments and medi a. In each case, before a real investigation could begin to establish the facts and examine the evidence, a politically acceptable explanation was put forward by government officials and repeated, without question, by the mass media. Evidence and facts tha t contradict the \"official\" version of events have been confiscated, destroyed, or simply ignored. The extremely hasty and improper sale of the steel from the World Trade Center to distant Asian smelters, for example, must rank as the most egregious case of destruction of evidence from a crime scene in American history. In late September 2001, officials uncovered a criminal scheme to divert metal to dumps in Long Island and New Jersey. Some 250 tons of scrap metal were found at unofficial dump sites. In November 2001 every truck carrying steel from the World Trade Center was outfitted with a GPS (Global Positioning System) device monitored by an Israeli named Yoram Shalmon of PowerLoc Technologies of Toronto, Ontario, a subcontractor on the clean - up proj ect. Shalmon tracked nearly 200 trucks in New York City in real time using PowerLoc's Vehicle Location Device (VLD). Each VLD unit costs about $1,000. ―We were able to start identifying patterns of behavior. If a driver arrived late, the traffic analyst would look at why. Maybe the driver stopped for lunch, or maybe he ran into traffic,‖ Shalmon told Jacqueline Emigh of SecuritySolutions.com. ―Ninety - nine percent of the drivers were extremely driven to do their jobs. But there were big concerns, because the loads consisted of highly sensitive material. One driver, for example, took an extended lunch break of an hour and a half. There was nothing criminal about that, but he was dismissed. There were also cases where trucks did little detours from their ro utes,‖ Shalmon says."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com SELLING THE EVIDENCE - The steel from the WTC, critical evidence of what caused the towers to collapse, was quickly destroyed after being sold to Asian smelters. Alan D. Ratner of Metal Management and the New York - based Hugo Neu Sch nitzer East profited from this criminal destruction of evidence. Ratner sold the WTC steel to Chinese companies, reportedly selling more than 50,000 tons of steel to a Shanghai steel company for $120 per ton. Ratner paid about $70 per ton for the steel.

Likewise, during the official dive for evidence to the wreck of Estonia , on which more than 852 people are known to have died, the crucial locking bolt from the bow visor, which o fficials blame for having caused the catastrophe, was thrown back into the sea. The bolt had been removed by divers and brought to the surface for investigation only to be thrown back by Börje Stenström, the Swedish navy commander who was the head of the t echnical group of the international investigation commission. According to German investigators, Stenström threw away the bolt, which according to his own scenario of the sinking, was \"one of the most important pieces of evidence.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Estonia's bow visor wa s blamed by corrupt investigators for causing the sinking. The crucial evidence, however, was thrown back into the sea. The Swedish government's effort to support the \"official lie\" with a computer simulation of the sinking failed because the vessel won't sink without a hole below the waterline. The first rule in maintaining a cover - up is to control access to the evidence. The second rule is to destroy any and all evidence that contradicts the official version of events. The fact that these three disasters occurred during very similar terror scenarios being staged as part of an exercise has been ignored by the mass media, which has treated these extremely uncanny coincidences as complete non - issues. Information about the exercises has been kept hidden from t he public. The government cover - ups have been greatly facilitated by the compliant mass media which has consistently ignored the fact that several mega - disasters occurred within the context of strikingly similar terrorism exercises. The terrorist attacks, for example, that struck New York and Washington on 9 - 11, and the London bombings of July 7, 2005, were the realization (i.e. the making real) of computer - based scenarios that were being staged in the same place at the same time. Would a truly free press i gnore the conspicuous fact that both events occurred within the context of very similar terror exercises? \"The easiest way to carry out a false flag attack is by setting up a military exercise that simulates the very attack you want to carry out,\" Captain Eric H.

But why has the mass media shown no interest in interviewing the families of these men in order to document and support the official story? How can it be than several of them are even reported to be alive and the media doesn't investigate? False flag terror attacks are designed and carried out with the intention of havi ng a targeted foe wrongly blamed in order to manipulate public opinion and foment war. Captain May, a Texan from Houston, certainly knows what he is talking about. He is an expert in military exercises involving simulations. May completed advanced courses at the U.S. Army's school for military intelligence officers at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and served five years with the U.S. Army's 75th Division as an Opposing Forces Controller, where he ran \"contrarian scenarios.\" May's aim, he says, as a former military intelligence officer who spent five years conducting war games, is to warn the public that the \"'next 9 - 11' -- constantly promised by officials and the media -- is likely to be carried out under the guise of future military exercises. \"If the American peo ple are aware of pending exercises and the danger they represent,\" May says, \"then the exercises cannot 'go live' and effect the very terror events that they are supposed to be rehearsing against.\" 9 - 11 and the July 7, 2005 bombings in London \"have smoking guns proving that the mass murderers were not foreign terrorists but domestic tyrants,\" May writes. The \"smoking guns,\" he says, are the terror exercises that simulated the attacks that actually occurred. While the terrorism/security drills created the \"c ontrarian scenario\" framework within which the real terror attacks occurred, it does not necessarily follow that the agency running the exercise is the actual terrorist. The true culprit is much more likely to be a foreign agency, who is covertly, but int imately aware of the planning of the exercise. By having access to the critical computer networks involved in the exercise this outside agency has the ability to hijack the drill and make it \"go live.\""},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com While the real terrorists could be from any agency tha t is involved in the drill, they could also be from a foreign intelligence organization that has gained \"back door\" access to the computer networks on which the exercise is planned and carried out.

As May says, the \"smoking gun\" ter ror drills disprove the official fairy tale that \"Islamic terrorists\" are responsible for these false flag terror attacks. The Arabs and Muslims who have been wrongly blamed for 9 - 11 and the London bombings have simply been framed, like Lee Harvey Oswald, as part of the deception.

On January 1, 1964, Rabin was pr omoted to Chief of Staff after returning from Dallas. Rabin's father, Nehemiah, had lived some thirteen years in Chicago's Yiddish - speaking Jewish community on the West Side, some of that time at 2734 Crystal Street with a Solomon Turovlin of the Jewish Da ily Forward , the Yiddish language paper.

LONDON - JULY 7, 2005 At the exact time of the terror bombings of the London Underground and a bus at Tavistock Square, a man named Peter Power was, with his crisis management company, Visor Consultants Ltd., conducting a terrorism drill for a mysterious un - named client. The Visor exercise was precisely identical to the bombings that occurred. Just how likely is such a coincidence? Peter Power had previously worked at Scotland Yard, the Anti Terrorist Branch, and as a police superintendent in West Dorset, England. In 1993, Power was himself the subject of a criminal investigation which, in April 1993, led to his suspension and retirement from the police. Superintendent Power was suspended following an internal police inquiry, which resulted in a file being submitted to the Director of Public Prosecution.

Peter Allen: To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were runni ng the exercise? Power: Precisely, and it was about half past nine this morning, we planned this for a company and for obvious reasons I don't want to reveal their name but they're listening and they'll know it. And we had a room full of crisis managers, for the first time they'd met, and so within five minutes we made a pretty rapid decision, \"this is the real one\" and so we went through the correct drills of activating crisis management procedures to jump from slow time to quick time thinking and so on. \"WE CHOSE A SCENARIO\" Later, on day of the bombings, Power also appeared in a television interview on ITV News in which he revealed more about the nature of the operation: Power: Today we were running an exercise for a company - bearing in mind I'm now in the private sector - and we sat everybody down, in the city - 1,000 people involved in the whole organization - but the crisis team.

There has been virtually no discussion in the \"mainstream\" media that the London bombi ngs, or other terror atrocities and disasters like 9 - 11 and the sinking of Estonia , occurred within the context of security drills that were very similar to what actually happened. Why has this crucial background information been censored? Astonishing firs t - hand accounts, like Peter Power's, from people engaged in these exercises were reported shortly after the events occurred, yet these important stories were confined to local news outlets and not reported in the major national and international news outle ts, in newspapers like the New York Times , for example, whose motto is: \"All the news that's fit to print.\" Power's comments about the amazing coincidences with his security drill were censored by the BBC in the same way as the eyewitness report of Stephen Evans, their reporter at the World Trade Center on 9 - 11.

The producers in London were clearly not interested in discussing that subject. How did the BBC editors know that explosions were something that should not be discussed? Why did th ey censor Evans' eyewitness account? From the first minute Evans spoke, however, it was quite obvious that his eyewitness report was being censored by the higher powers at the BBC. When the BBC revisited the events of 9 - 11 with Evans, there was absolutely no mention of the \"series of explosions\" he had witnessed on"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com the morning of the attacks. How can that be? Such blatant and intentional omissions are properly defined as censorship. Evans' astonishing eyewitness account from 9 - 11 was evidently dropped into the \"memory hole\" at the BBC. Peter Power's revealing comments about the London bombings met the same fate. The BBC has a very peculiar history regarding the events of 9 - 11. Not only did the British network censor Evans' reports of explosions at the Worl d Trade Center, but it also reported that the building known as WTC 7 collapsed about 30 minutes before the 47 - story tower fell straight down into its foundation. Jane Standley, a BBC World television reporter in New York City on 9 - 11 reported at about 4: 54 p.m. (21:54 GMT) that the Salomon Brother's building owned by Larry Silverstein (WTC 7) had collapsed. Silverstein's building, however (which he later admitted had been \"pulled\"), did not collapse until 5:20 p.m. (22:20 GMT). BBC news editor Richard Por ter subsequently wrote on the BBC website in February 2007: \"We no longer have the original tapes of our 9 - 11 coverage (for reasons of cock - up, not conspiracy).\" But, why would the BBC destroy its original tapes of 9 - 11? (This is exactly the same excuse provided by the Hoffman Estates (Illinois) police who said they had destroyed the video tapes they had made of their three - man undercover tactical squad arresting me at my house in August 2006.) The BBC's Jane Standley reported that Larry Silverstein's Salomon Brothers building (WTC 7) had collapsed 30 minutes before it fell straight into its foundation. The BBC later said it had destroyed all of its original tapes of 9 - 11 broadcasts. For independent journalists to question the controlled - media's versio n of events, from which such significant first - hand accounts have been censored, is to risk being branded a \"conspiracy theorist.\" The public is now told that eyewitness accounts cannot be trusted – at least when they differ from the official version. Eyew itness reports from people who were in the disaster or who saw it with their own eyes can not be considered as reliable testimony, we are told. How very odd."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Such was the case with the downing of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, New York in 1996, when more than a hundred eyewitnesses reported seeing what appeared to be a missile streak from the surface of the ocean, strike the aircraft, and cause an explosive fireball. I attended the final presentation of the official TWA 800 report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in 2000, when David Mayer, whose only credential as a panel member was a Ph.D. in Applied Experimental Psychology from Rice University, audaciously dismissed the reports of more than one hundred eyewitnesses as the collec tive hallucinations of intoxicated New Yorkers, based solely on the fact that it was a summer evening! At that point, it was abundantly clear that there was something seriously wrong with the NTSB and their investigation of the downing of TWA 800. The cove r - up could hardly have been more obvious. THE \"PLANE - INTO - BUILDING\" DRILL OF 9 - 11 On 9 - 11, an agency of the Department of Defense and the CIA was conducting a terror scenario in which an imaginary airplane from Washington's Dulles International Airport was to crash into one of the four towers of the suburban campus of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in Chantilly, Virginia, just a few miles from the Pentagon. The plane that allegedly crashed into the Pentagon, American Airlines Flight 77, departed f rom the same airport at 8:20 a.m. on 9 - 11. When the terror scenario became real in New York and at the Pentagon, the NRO exercise was cancelled and nearly all its three thousand employees, the people who operate the nation's \"eye in the sky,\" were sent hom e. \"BIZARRE COINCIDENCE\" The government said it was a \"bizarre coincidence\" that the NRO, a military intelligence agency working under the Department of Defense and the CIA, had planned a simulated exercise with a mock \"plane - into - building\" crash on the mo rning of 9 - 11. \"It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility,\" spokesman Art Haubold told the Associated Press in August 2002. \"As soon as the real world events began, we canceled the exercise. \" As the agency that operates many of the nation's spy satellites, the NRO personnel come from the military and the CIA. When the attacks occurred, however, most of the three thousand people who work at the agency were sent home. Why would they do that? The fact that the spy agency had planned such a drill was casually leaked in an announcement for a Homeland Security conference in Chicago in 2002. In a promotion for speaker John Fulton, a CIA officer assigned as chief of NRO's strategic gaming division, the announcement said: On the morning of September 11, 2001, Mr. Fulton and his team ... were running a pre - planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com plane were to strike a building. Little did they know that t he scenario would come true in a dramatic way that day. CRITICAL FAILURES The most pressing questions about why the U.S. military air defense system failed to intercept the four hijacked planes on 9 - 11 are obviously of crucial importance. Captain May write s that \"even official apologists call [9 - 11] the greatest defense failure in American history.\" How could the most modern and expensive air force in the world fail to intercept four airliners, three of which roamed wild for hundreds of miles before striki ng landmark buildings in New York and Washington? Why was the U.S. air defense system unable to intercept several large, slow - moving planes before they struck the nation's largest city and its capital? If the U.S. Air Force couldn't intercept lumbering ci vilian planes, how could they possibly stop a hostile invasion of fighter jets or missiles? These crucial questions have never been raised by the government - appointed commissions or the media, which have all avoided discussing the military exercises of 9 - 1 1. It's not that these drills were not reported, but rather that their connection to the disasters has not been openly discussed and investigated. Four months after 9 - 11, the Post - Standard of Syracuse, New York, published an article by Hart Seely that fea tured first - hand accounts of the military radar operators of the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) at the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, New York. These radar operators were the eyes of the U.S. air defense system for the eastern part of the na tion on 9 - 11. In Seely's article, the NEADS personnel explained how a North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD) exercise called Vigilant Guardian, which they were participating in, had caused systemic confusion which prevented an effective military respons e to the real emergency. The confusion at NEADS was evident from the moment Boston Flight Control informed them that a plane had been hijacked. At 8:38 a.m. an air traffic controller telephoned Sergeant Jeremy Powell at NEADS to inform him that one of thei r planes had been hijacked and was headed to New York: \"Is this real - world or exercise?\" Powell asked. \"No. This is not an exercise; not a test,\" Powell was told, according to the transcripts of the 9 - 11 Commission report. \"IT MUST BE PART OF THE EXERCISE \" Seely's article described the context -- and the confusion -- at NEADS: 6 a.m.: WAR GAMES Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins figured it would be a long day. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Sept. 11 was Day 2 of \"Vigilant Guardian,\" an exercise that would pose an imaginary crisis to North America n Air Defense outposts nationwide. The simulation would run all week, and Deskins, starting her 12 - hour shift in the Operations Center as the NORAD unit's airborne control and warning officer, might find herself on the spot. Day 1 of the simulation had mo ved slowly. She hoped the exercise gathered steam. It made a long day go faster. 8:40 a.m.: REAL WORLD In the Ops Center, three rows of radar scopes face a high wall of wide - screen monitors. Supervisors pace behind technicians who peer at the instruments . Here it is always quiet, always dark, except for the green radar glow. At 8:40, Deskins noticed senior technician Jeremy Powell waving his hand. Boston Center was on the line, he said. It had a hijacked airplane. \"It must be part of the exercise,\" Desk ins thought. At first, everybody did. Then Deskins saw the glowing direct phone line to the Federal Aviation Administration. On the phone she heard the voice of a military liaison for the FAA's Boston Center. \"I have a hijacked aircraft,\" he told her. A merican Airlines Flight 11, headed to Los Angeles, had veered off course, apparently toward New York. The liaison said to get \"some F - 16s or something\" airborne. Forty - one minutes earlier, Flight 11 had left Logan Airport with 81 passengers. For the last 27 minutes, it had not responded to ground control. Deskins requested Flight 11's latest position, which an operator put up on the screen. Flight 11 wasn't there. Someone had turned off its transponder, the device that identifies the plane to ground cont rol. Boston Center could still track it on primary radar, but the operators in Rome would be hard - pressed to find it amid the jumble of blips on their screens. We'll direct the intercept, the liaison told Deskins. Just get something up there. Deskins ran up a short flight of stairs to the Battle Cab and reported the hijacked plane - real world, not a simulation. NEADS RADAR OPERATORS – These were the military radar systems and personnel who were confused on 9 - 11 because of the Vigilant Guardian simulati on.

The real perpetrators of 9 - 11 did. NOT A SIMULATION What is most peculiar is that Seely's informative article about the confusion among the critical military radar operators at NEADS was never published or referenced by any national newspaper in the United States. The New York Times , for example, has never even mentioned \"Vigilant Guardian,\" the air defense exercise that contributed to the confusion behind the military's failure to protect New York City on 9 - 11. Oddly, among the national newspapers and news magazines of the Unit ed States, Vigilant Guardian was only mentioned once, very briefly, in a Washington Post book review of the 9 - 11 Commission report. The review began: \"If the 9 - 11 report had been written as a novel, nobody would believe it. The story is too far - fetched.\" The Post mentioned Vigilant Guardian when it quoted \"a little - noticed footnote\" from the report: When FAA officials realize (late) that planes are being hijacked, they can't monitor them - or decide what to do. The vice president thinks he has issued order s to shoot down civilian planes, but the pilots in the air don't get the word. The military's air - defense command isn't sure whether it's dealing with an exercise or a real event. Incredibly, according to a little - noticed footnote in the report, \"On 9 - 11, NORAD was scheduled to conduct a military exercise, Vigilant Guardian, which postulated a bomber attack from the former Soviet Union.\" Vigilant Guardian obviously confused the military because simulated hijackings and false \"injects,\" which are radar indic ations of non - existent planes, were reportedly part of the exercise. This is why Deskins and others were initially uncertain whether the reports of hijacked planes were \"real world\" or simulation. \"First thing that went through my mind was, 'Is this part o f the exercise?\" Air Force Maj. Gen. Larry Arnold, who was at a command center at the Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, told ABC News. \"Is this some kind of a screw - up?'\" The military's inability to respond effectively to the rogue aircraft of 9 - 11 was ev idently caused, at least in part, by the NORAD exercise. The fact that a similar exercise, involving a plane striking a military facility near the Pentagon, was being staged on the morning of 9 - 11, indicates that the computer - based exercises played key rol es in the actual terror attacks that occurred. What role the military exercises played in the 9 - 11 terror attacks and how they could have been hijacked, and by whom, are all questions that need to be answered, but these are questions that will be addressed in a subsequent chapter. THE ESTONIA CATASTROPHE"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The unexplained sinking of the Baltic ferry Estonia on its way to Stockholm from Tallinn in late September 1994 is the third mega - disaster (not chronologically) that occurred within the framework of a military exercise. The day before it sank, Estonia had also been the scene of a terrorism exercise in whic h the scenario was a terror bombing of the ferry. Looking at the NATO military assets that were assembled nearby and the terrorism drill that had just been conducted on the ship, the stage was set and the actors were in place for what turned out to be a re al disaster. The Estonia catastrophe is Europe's worst maritime disaster since World War II. Tragically, 852 people are known to have died when Estonia sank in the early hours of September 28, 1994, but more than 1,000 may have perished, if, as reported, s ome 150 Iraqi Kurds were being smuggled to Sweden in one of the trucks on its car deck. Scores of people died in the frigid water of the Baltic Sea waiting for rescue boats and helicopters that came too late. More than ninety bodies were retrieved from th e life rafts. THE TOLL - The bodies of some of the Estonia victims retrieved from the Baltic Sea. NATO'S \"SEARCH & RESCUE\" EXERCISE Although it is seldom mentioned, the Estonia catastrophe occurred on the first day of a 10 - day NATO naval exercise called Cooperative Venture 94, in which more than fifteen ships and \"a number of maritime aircraft\" were prepared to conduct \"humanitarian and search and rescue operations\" in nearby waters. The NATO exercise, which involved ten NATO member states and the Baltic \"partner\" nations of Russia, Sweden, Poland, and Lithuania, was to be staged in the Skagerrak, between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and the Norwegian Sea, according to the NATO press release about the exercise from September 16, 1994. The NATO nations who participated in the exercise were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. Many other allies and partners sent observers to the exercise, according to the NATO press release."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The fact that Estonia sank as the submarines, ships, planes, personnel, and satellites from the navies of fourteen nations were preparing to begin their ten - day \"search and rescue operations\" exercise off the coast of Sweden raises several obvious questions that d eserve to be answered: If NATO had fifteen ships and a number of aircraft assembled and prepared to conduct \"search and rescue operations,\" why didn't NATO assist in the early morning rescue operation for the victims from the Estonia catastrophe? The Swed ish rescue helicopters were ill - prepared and ill - equipped, which resulted in a fatal delay for those waiting to be rescued. Many Estonia victims died of exposure due to the delayed rescue. Of the 852 lives lost only 94 bodies were recovered. A complete list of the dead is here . \"Were there specially - equipped rescue helicopters or other aircraft that could have assisted?\" Drew Wilson, author of The Hole (2006), a book about the Estonia catastrophe, wrote. \"Survivors who didn't die from hypothermia while floating on upturned boats or flotsam in the biting water waited four - six hours for rescue. NATO search - and - rescue personnel and equipment could have saved some lives. Flying time was u nder 1 hour. Why didn't they respond to the distress traffic? What happened?\" The evidence also indicates that the Mayday signals from Estonia had been jammed, as were all radio communications in the area. \"A series of comprehensive malfunctions in region al communication systems all at once, and all at the exact time the ferry had sunk suggest involvement by a military or intelligence services,\" Wilson writes in The Hole . \"Was a distress call intentionally blocked? If so, why? \"Communications throughout t he Northern Baltic Sea were disrupted during the time of the accident.\" As Wilson documents, VHF Channel 16, the international Mayday channel, and Channel 2182 were blocked. \"Signal jamming of all radio communications apparently occurred on the Southern c oastline of Finland as the accident unfolded."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com \"Werner Hummel, the German investigator, said that his Group had documentation showing that the regional telephone network servicing the catastrophe site failed just as it was needed most.

NATO, with state - of - the - art satellite and airborne surveillance assets in place over the Baltic Sea certainly must know who was blocking the SOS calls. Why has this information been kept secret since 1994? Blocking SOS calls and jamming distress signals is a violation of international law. Why has this crime not been investigated? The intentional blocking of the Mayda y signals from Estonia points to complicity in mass murder. \"Naval exercises are meant to be as realistic as possible,\" Olivier Schmidt, author of The Intelligence Files: Today's Secrets, Tomorrow's Scandals , writes. What was the \"search and rescue\" scenar io of NATO's Cooperative Venture 94 exercise, which was commanded at sea by the Dutch submarine commander Gijsbert Goofert Hooft? I sent a series of pertinent questions to Robert Pszczel, NATO's press officer for Baltic issues, about NATO's response to the Estonia catastrophe: Did NATO have any naval assets in the Baltic Sea on the night of September 27 - 28, 1994 and what actions did NATO take in the immediate aftermath of the Estonia disaster? Did NATO pick up the Mayday signals being sent (and jammed) fr om Estonia ? Why didn't NATO assist, given the urgent need to retrieve hundreds of freezing people from life rafts? What was the scenario of NATO's search and recovery exercise?

ESTONIA'S BOMB DRILLS The Estonia ferry had been the object of bomb threats and had participated in at least two terror bomb exercises in 1994, one in February and another just the day before it sank. On February 2, 1994, Estonia was the subject of a major mock bomb exercise conducted with RITS, Sweden's maritime fire and rescue agency, and the Stockholm police. The Stockholm police had requested to take part in the exercise and used bomb - sniffing dogs to find explosives. The terror simulation involved a scenario in which \"bombs\" had been placed in the sa una and swimming pool area on the lowest deck, below the waterline in the bow of the ship. A second \"bomb\" was placed in the sleeping quarters on the first deck, also below the waterline. In the Estonia terror scenario, the explosives in the sauna were to be found by the dogs, while the second \"bomb\" was to explode. The purpose of this terrorism drill was to train with the ship's crew and include shore - based terrorism experts and police with bomb - sniffin g dogs, brought to the ship by helicopter. In the simulation, the \"bombs\" were set to explode about halfway between the Estonian and Swedish coasts, which is where the ship actually sank in September 1994 after a similar mock bomb threat exercise. When Est onia sank, another mock bomb exercise on the ship had just been concluded. Survivors from the sinking actually reported hearing two huge explosions immediately before the ship listed to starboard. Several crew members testified to having heard the coded fi re alarm \"Mr. Skylight to No. 1 and 2\" over the ferry's public address system at about 1:02 a.m. after the vessel had listed severely. This is the message for the crew that was used during the previous bomb drill in February 1994. \"Mr. Skylight\" was a sign al for the fire fighters to proceed to their fire stations 1 and 2 and prepare for damage control. The fact that this coded alarm was given indicates that"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com there was damage caused by a fire or explosion that required immediate attention. The ferry sank with in thirty minutes. Eyewitness testimony from survivors plus the fact that the ship sank extremely quickly strongly suggest that explosives were used to tear a large hole in the hull below the waterline. Swedish policemen who had just conducted training inv olving a mock bomb threat on the ferry were returning home when Estonia sank. Of the seventy policemen, only seven survived. The trans - Baltic ferry Estonia sank in less than 30 minutes after two explosions rocked the ship in the middle of the night. A m ock terror drill of a bombing scenario had just been completed on the ship the day before. The passenger ferry was being used to transport Soviet military contraband when she sank. The highest officials in Swedish customs, the government, and military wer e aware of the sensitive and illegal shipments that put the ferry at risk. Is this why they are so dedicated to protecting the lies about the sinking?

Kennedy's plane, are linked with a captain of Israeli army intelligence and his system to remotely control aircraft. The relationship between these appoint ed officials of the federal agencies responsible for aviation safety with a senior officer of a foreign military intelligence raises serious questions about the degree of Israeli influence at the FAA and NTSB. THE COMPUTER CRIMES BEHIND 9 - 11 The dependen ce of the U.S. government and military on computer systems, which run on software provided by outside vendors, is the Achilles' heel of the world's most powerful nation. 9 - 11 was clear proof of that fundamental weakness and vulnerability."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com 9 - 11 was a comp uter crime. Apart from being a monstrous crime of mass murder and false flag terrorism, 9 - 11 was also a sophisticated computer crime, carried out through long - term foreign infiltration of the most sensitive U.S. military and government computer networks. This infiltration, carried out by a foreign intelligence agency, gave the perpetrators of 9 - 11 \"real - time\" access to all the data on the computers of the U.S. government and military. On 9 - 11, this \"super - user\" access to the data of the most critical gov ernment computer networks gave the terrorists the ability to thwart the military response to the emergency as it developed. Most importantly, the terrorists who committed 9 - 11 through their \"super - user\" access to the most critical computer networks of the U.S. government still have that access. The evidence indicates that this infiltration was carried out by the military intelligence agency of the State of Israel. PTECH & 9 - 11 The subject of computer sabotage in relation to the aerial attacks of 9 - 11 wa s brought to the fore by Indira Singh, who spoke at early 9 - 11 truth events organized by Kyle Hence. During these early 9 - 11 \"truth\" events, a small Massachusetts - based software company called Ptech was brought up by Singh, who sought to link it to Arab t errorists. Ptech was said to be a start - up company from Quincy, Massachusetts, whose software was loaded onto the most sensitive computer systems across the U.S. government, including those of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air For ce, two agencies whose systems failed miserably on 9 - 11. Indira Singh Singh, a senior risk and IT consultant with JP Morgan Chase on 9 - 11, is described as a \"whistle - blower\" because of her revelations about Ptech's involvement with the critical computer systems that failed on 9 - 11. \"Ptech was with MITRE Corporation in the basement of the FAA for two years prior to 9/11,\" Singh said. \"Their specific job is to look at interoperability issues the FAA had with NORAD and the Air Force in the case of an emerge ncy. If anyone was in a position to know that the FAA -- that there was a"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com window of opportunity or to insert software or to change anything -- it would have been Ptech along with MITRE.\" Singh has spoken extensively about Ptech's alleged connections with Saudi Arabia, for example, with Pacifica Radio in 2005: Maybe those organizations don‘t fully know who their masters are. And Ptech is the one thread, the one golden thread you pull on and all of this is unraveled, because it goes into the corporations, i t goes into these government entities, it goes into the terrorism financing entities that were, that none of which have been, by the way, taken to task. There are just so many questions about what does this all mean. And as we investigated, as I investigat ed further, we found that the origins of Ptech were very interesting – where did this company come from obviously is the first question. And how did they get to be so powerful, who were the people, who were the organizations that brought them in, who knew, who gave them the power? Ptech software \"is utilized at the highest levels of almost every government and military and defense organization in this country,\" Singh said, \"including the Secret Service, the FBI, the Department of Defense, the House of Repre sentatives, the Treasury Department, the IRS, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, and, last but not least, the Federal Aviation Administration.\" I found it hard to believe that the most sensitive government and military computers would run enterprise softw are from a Lebanese - owned start - up company called Ptech from Quincy, Massachusetts. All the talk about the Saudi - financier behind Ptech being linked to Osama Bin Laden smelled like a \"cut out\" to me. It simply did not make sense that the most secure comp uter systems of the U.S. government would be running software written by a Lebanese Muslim financed by a Saudi who happened to be on the most - wanted list of global terrorists. When I turned my attention to Ptech, I soon discovered that the real key person involved in the development of the company was a Zionist Jewish lawyer named Michael Goff from Worcester, Massachusetts. Goff also worked for an Israeli - run computer security company called Guardium. This confirmed my suspicion that Ptech was probably an Arab \"cut out\" controlled by the Mossad, and that Goff was their point man in Ptech."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Michael S. Goff, Mossad's Man at Ptech Goff's father and grandfather had been high - level Masons in the Worcester lodge of B'nai B'rith, a secret Jewish Masonic group formed in New York City in 1843.

It seemed to me that the Ptech cut - out had be en exposed. My revelations about Ptech's Zionist roots were published in a newspaper based in Washington, D.C. Singh, however, ignored the evidence of Israeli involvement with the creation of Ptech and continued to accuse the company of being linked to S audi sponsors of terror. Meanwhile, Ptech software is still running on U.S. government and military computers. Singh and I were asking the same questions: How did Ptech get to be so powerful? Who were the people, who were the organizations that brought them in? Who knew? Who gave them the power? After 9 - 11, the crucial question was how did Ptech's software get loaded onto the critical U.S. government networks – particularly those of the FAA, the U.S. Air Force, and NORAD? Who, in their right mind, w ould have allowed Ptech personnel and software anywhere near the FAA's core air traffic control system computers in Herndon, Virginia? During my research about the military exercises that were on - going when 9 - 11 occurred, I read documents about how the FA A and NEADS computer systems failed. The FAA in particular was extremely slow to contact the military about the rogue aircraft of 9 - 11. In one case, one of the rogue aircraft had been allowed to fly without communication for nearly thirty minutes before the military was notified. \"THE HEART OF THE MATTER\" The flawed and delayed FAA procedures and communications with the military are at \"the heart of the matter,\" as 9 - 11 relative Kristen Breitweiser said:"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com You know, it is very upsetting that the 9/11 Com mission had to subpoena the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA].

These are threshold issues that go to the heart of the matter. How did the FAA overlook 150,000 documents pertaining to these issues? It is more than mildly upsetting that they would leave out these documents. MONTE BELGER – FAA DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR In the documents about the FAA failures on 9 - 11, I came across the name of a Monte R. Belger, acting deputy administrator of the FAA at the time.

As the New York Times of June 7, 2001, reported: The aviation agency is installing a co mputer system that controllers can use to determine whether airplanes can depart from established traffic lanes and fly long distances, and whether they will conflict with other airplanes by doing so."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Belger was the key decision maker at the Federal Aviati on Administration, responsible for the software and computer upgrades that involved Ptech, the suspicious upgrades which were being done during the years prior to 9 - 11. Documents and reports from the MITRE Center for Advanced Aviation System Development i n McLean , Virginia, show that Ptech was working with MITRE on FAA computer systems. As his on - line biography says, Belger, a thirty - year veteran of the FAA, was Acting Deputy Administrator for the FAA for five years, from 1997 - 2002, leading the 49,000 - per son team and in charge of operating the world's safest aviation system. During his tenure with the FAA, Belger was the Associate Administrator for Air Traffic Services, responsible for day - to - day operations of the nation's airspace system, and supervised the FAA's modernization plan aimed at improving aviation capacity, safety and service to airlines. Belger played a pivotal role in assisting in the transition of aviation security responsibilities from the FAA to the new Transportation Security Administrat ion, and he co - chaired the FAA's successful efforts to adopt acquisition and personnel reform. Belger retired from the FAA in September 2002. U.S. AVIATION TECHNOLOGY LLC After he left the FAA, Belger became the \"Vice President, Government Connection\" of a small Israeli - run company based in the Fort Lauderdale area called U.S. Aviation Technology. The company was founded by Ehud \"Udi\" Mendelson, who described himself as \"a captain in the prestigious Army Intelligence Unit of the Israel Defense Force.\" \" Ehud received his BS Degree in Business and Economics from the Bar - Elan [sic] University in Tel - Aviv, Israel.

Company documents and information from t he Israel Venture Capital Research Center website specifically name Monte Belger of Centreville, Virginia, as a Vice President and Government Connection of U.S. Aviation Technology LLC. Mendelson, age 51, was also the Chief Technology Officer of U.S. Avia tion Technology, which was based in his apartment in Parkland, Florida. Mendelson's company promoted a remote - control system that allows a \"ground pilot\" to monitor and adjust the computer flight systems on aircraft. As he says in his presentations, \"We put the ground 'pilot' in the cockpit.\" His software and design was promoted as a system to obtain real - time data from the aircraft's computer recorders (black box, FDR) in order to monitor flight systems – and make corrections – if necessary. The possib ility to remotely hijack a plane with Mendelson's system is obvious. Mendelson also promoted a Flight Data Animator, which he said gives the ground pilot all of the data and the visuals that the pilot in the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com aircraft has. In the two on - line presentations of this equipment it is implied that corrections can be made by the ground pilot to avoid an accident or situation.

Mendelson was promoting his software and system before 9 - 11 and hoped to have it on the market in November 2001, according to a document in his company presentation. I called Monte Belger to ask him about his relationsh ip with Ehud Mendelson, an officer in Israel's military intelligence agency, and his remote - control aviation company. I found it very disturbing that an administrator with the FAA would be associated with such a business project, especially after 9 - 11. I called Mr. Belger at his home on Eagle Tavern Lane in Centreville, Virginia at about 9 a.m. on January 24, 2008. I asked him about his relationship with U.S. Aviation Technology and Ehud Mendelson. He denied knowing or having anything to do with either and asked me to call him later at his office at Lockheed Martin Corporation where he is a Vice President responsible for Transportation Systems Security. When I called his office, he put me on speaker phone, he said, in order to try and access the website s where he was named as a Vice President of U.S. Aviation Technology. He continued to deny knowing anything about the company or its founder, a member of Israel's Army Intelligence Unit. PETER GOELZ – NTSB Peter Goelz, the former managing director of th e NTSB, the federal investigative body that oversees air crashes, is also named, along with Monte Belger and others, as a Vice President, Corporate Strategy, in U.S. Aviation Technology.

During my years at the National Transportation Safety Board we were greatly concerned about the increasing complexity of airplane accidents.

In a number of accidents, particular[ly] those over open water (TWA Flight 800, Egypt Air, Swiss Air) the investigations were seriously hindered until the boxes were recovered. In the tragic events of September 11th, three of the four FDR‘s were destroyed so no data (or voice recordings) was recovered. Your system of real time downloading of aircraft data meets a very real and pressing problem. Not only is it important from a safety and secu rity standpoint it also has applicability for navigation and flight management. A robust two - way data pipe from the aircraft to the ground and back could revolutionize the industry.

Computer Crimes: Understanding the Deception Behind 9 - 11 and Election Fraud The stealing of American elections is primarily a computer crime, as was the false flag terror attack of 9 - 11. These crimes are carried ou t by criminals who produce malicious computer code and enterprise software. I know Americans who watch television every night. I actually know people who spend virtually every non - working minute of the day in front of a television, bathing in the absolute ly fake and utterly non - intellectual \"reality\" of TV. Millions of Americans, in fact, receive the bulk of their news and information about the world from the television. That means that a very large segment of the American population has a worldview that has been shaped primarily by what they have seen on TV. For many people, the artificial and contrived \"reality\" of the two - dimensional television screen largely defines and informs their view of the real world. This is why so many Americans know so little about the Middle East. The most obvious symptom of this television - induced ignorance is that most Americans know nothing about the real history of Zionism and the State of Israel. They are completely unaware, for example, of the long history of Zionist te rrorism against Palestinians, Americans, Jews, and even Israelis. Raised on Hollywood television and movies, many Americans don't have the slightest clue about the real nature of Zionism. Think about this for a minute: When was the last time you saw a mov ie in which the bad guys were Israelis speaking a guttural Slavic - based language called Yiddish or \"Ivreet\"? Can you recall even one television program in which the criminals or terrorists were Israelis? Apart from The Little Drummer Girl by John Le Carr e, I have never seen a film in which Israelis were anything but heroes or victims, usually both. The Little Drummer Girl , which is a film worth watching, shows how false flag terror attacks are frequently committed by Israeli intelligence agents to be blam ed on their enemies. Such false flag Zionist terror attacks were carried out against synagogues in Europe in the movie, and in Baghdad in real life during the late 1940s. In the usual Hollywood films about terrorists, such as the Die Hard films and others produced by Zionist media moguls, the bad guys are always Arabs, Germans, or corrupt members of the U.S. military. For many decades the Zionists who control Hollywood have defined who the \"bad guys\" are for most Americans. Israelis and their fellow Zioni sts are, therefore, never the \"bad guys\" in Hollywood films, although Israelis and Zionists play a very major role, if not the leading role, in the real world of organized crime."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Kobi Alexander, one of the high - level Israeli criminals involved in Comvers e, Odigo, and 9 - 11. After stealing hundreds of millions of dollars, Alexander fled to Israel and Namibia seeking refuge from U.S. justice. Israeli criminals like Alexander are seldom portrayed in Hollywood films. For the people in the U.S. military whose job it is to protect and defend the United States, reality is largely defined by the information they receive on their computer monitors. These people spend most of their workdays sitting in front of screens that provide the data to which they respond, of ten in life - or - death situations. But who really controls the information that the average American and the specialists in the U.S. military receive on their screens? You may be surprised to discover that the man behind the curtain is an Israeli with a thi ck guttural accent and a foreign and extremely racist view of the world. ACCEPTING VIRTUAL REALITY Having observed the counting of the votes in the elections in many countries, I found this essential process of democratic elections to be the most bizarre in Chicago, where there is absolutely no interest by the public or the media in how the votes are actually counted. So far gone is the democratic franchise in Chicago that it can be said that it no longer exists in any meaningful way."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com An electronic voting machine: a device for stealing elections and controlling nations. When I was at Election Headquarters at the office of the Clerk of Cook County in downtown Chicago to observe the \"vote count,\" I was told to wait at a counter and simply watch the tel evision screens overhead. I inquired, ―But where is the vote count happening? I was informed by Scott Burnham that I could observe the counting of the votes.‖ The vote count, I was then told, was being done in a back room by the employees of a private c ompany, and there I could not go. When I monitored the election in Chicago in March 2006, the back room \"counting of the votes\" process was being run by a bunch of Venezuelans working for a mysterious company called Sequoia Voting Systems. This privately - owned and foreign company was running the elections for Chicago and Cook County, that shining beacon of democracy. Sequoia's website says this: Sequoia is a leading American - owned election technology provider with major offices in California, Colorado and New York and an unsurpassed 100 - year - plus history of providing accurate, reliable, accessible and innovative voting solutions dating back to the nation's first lever - based mechanical voting equipment in the 1890s. Nobody in Chicago had the slightest clue who really owned Sequoia, nor did anybody even care. All I could find was that it was a shell company registered in the Dutch Antilles registered to another shell company in The Netherlands. The two young Venezuelans who were running the company were appar ently Sephardic Jews whose fathers were film producers in the movie business in South America. The election results for Cook County, produced by our Venezuelan friends, were displayed on television monitors, and the members of the press simply recorded th e"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com results and called it an election. They could not have cared less about how the votes were being counted. When I told a Chicago television person that I was there to see how the votes were counted, and commented that they did a better job counting votes in Serbia, she responded that she was glad she was not in Serbia. That is how elections are done in Chicago, one of the most corrupt cities in the world, and it is very much the same in every other city and state in the United States. The counting of the votes in American elections, you see, has been completely removed from the oversight of the American people and has been turned over to private foreign - owned companies, who own the equipment and control the software that runs the voting equipment and coun ts the votes for most American voters. Some of these companies involved in U.S. elections, such as Voxeo, which processed the tally of the Iowa caucus in 2004 giving John Forbes Kerry an undeserved boost, are owned or controlled by Israeli military intell igence. Again in 2008, the Voxeo results of the Iowa caucus gave Barack Obama an unexpected victory. In many cases, the election software is controlled by the Israelis, and through back doors they are able to manipulate the results. The controlled media ignores the fundamental problem that there is no transparency in American elections. The theft of American elections by privately owned election and software companies tied to Israeli intelligence is an absolute non - issue in the Zionist - controlled media in the United States. So, who really controls American elections? Ask Shimon Peres or Ehud Olmert or the director of Mossad, but don't expect the Zionist - controlled media in the United States to tell you. The stealing of American elections is primarily a c omputer crime, as was the false flag terror attack of 9 - 11. These crimes are carried out by criminals who produce malicious computer code and enterprise software. The part of the crime done through the computer systems is very difficult to detect and trace , which gives the perpetrators a false sense of invulnerability, not unlike the bad guys in a James Bond film. There is, however, an agent who leaves a record of producing and distributing the software that is used in these computer crimes. This is the st arting point from which we can determine who is really behind these computer crimes. PTECH & 9 - 11 – THE \"ARAB\" DISGUISE FAILS During the first 9 - 11 \"truth\" events, there was a great deal of discussion about a Massachusetts - based software company called P tech, which had been involved with the computer systems of the FAA and NORAD, two agencies whose systems completely failed on 9 - 11. \"Ptech was with Mitre Corporation in the basement of the FAA for two years prior to 9 - 11 and their specific job was to look at interoperability issues the FAA had with NORAD"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com and the Air Force, in case of an emergency,\" the former risk and software specialist Indira Singh told the 9 - 11 Citizens' Commission hearings. So this mysterious little company from Quincy, Massachusetts, whose software was on all the critical computer networks of the U.S. government and military, we were told, was Arab - owned, financed, and linked to terrorists. This, however, was quite false; Ptech was simply an Arab \"cut out.\" As I quickly discovered, Ptech's Arab identity was fake; it was nothing but an Arab \"cut out.\" Ptech was, in fact, an Israeli - controlled Mossad front company, made to look like an Arab - owned company. When a company goes to such lengths to mask its true identity, you can be sure th ere is a very important reason. In an article of January 2005, entitled \"Ptech, 9 - 11, and USA - Saudi Terror, Part II,\" an author named Michael Kane wrote on Michael Ruppert's website From The Wilderness: January 27, 2005 (FTW) - Ptech - the software compa ny whose major investors and directors are strongly linked to the Muslim Brotherhood - produced software that derived from PROMIS, had an artificial intelligence core, and was installed on virtually every computer system of the U.S. government and its mili tary agencies on September 11, 2001. This included the White House, Treasury Department (Secret Service), Air Force, FAA, CIA, FBI, both houses of Congress, Navy, Department of Energy, IRS, Booz Allen Hamilton, IBM, Enron and more. Whoever plotted 9/11 d efinitely viewed the FAA as an enemy that morning. Overriding FAA systems would be the most effective way to ensure the attacks were successful. To do this, the FAA needed an evolution of PROMIS software installed on their systems and Ptech was just that; the White House & Secret Service had the same software on their systems - likely a superior modified version capable of \"surveillance and intervention\" functions. Ptech is enterprise architecture software, which Indira planned on customizing to use as \"ri sk architecture\" software. Enterprise architecture software is designed with the express purpose of knowing everything that is going on throughout the entirety of the enterprise in real - time. In the case of Ptech software installed on White House, Secret Service, Air Force and FAA systems, the enterprise included all of the data produced by those agencies in real - time. How odd. What was so telling about these early reports by Kane and others about Ptech in the 9 - 11 \"truth\" movement is that these people se emed to know a great deal about how the Ptech software works, while they were completely blind about the Israeli connection to the company. They all stressed that Ptech was an Arab - owned and financed company from Quincy, Massachusetts . Either they don't kn ow anything about"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com who Ptech is -- or they are supporting the lie that it is an Arab company. I suspect the latter. I never accepted the notion that 9 - 11 had been carried out by Muslims in Pakistan or terrorists based in the caves of Afghanistan.

It made no sense that Arab terrorists, who could barely fly, could deceive the U.S. Air Force, NORAD, and the FAA , and that the extremely sophisticated 9 - 11 operation was directed from a cave in Afghanistan. I'm sorry, but that is just not believable. Ptech, as I discovered, was from the beginning controlled by a Jewish lawyer from Worcester, Massachusetts, named Mi chael S. Goff. It is very clear that Goff worked for Mossad, because the prize client of his PR firm was a Mossad - owned company named Guardium. Michael S.

In mid - June, Bergantino received a tip from a woman in New York who suspected that Ptech, a computer software company in Quincy, Mass., had ties to terrorists. Ptech specialized in developing software that manages information contained in compu ter networks. Bergantino's investigation revealed that Ptech's clients included many federal"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com governmental agencies, including the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Naval Air Command, Congress, the Department of Energy, the Federal Aviation Administr ation, the Internal Revenue Service, NATO, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and even the White House. \"Ptech was doing business with every federal government in defense and had access to key government data,\" Bergantino said. The Mossad handler at Ptech was, in my opinion, an American named Michael S. Goff, who is disingenuous about what he did, when he worked at, and when he left, Ptech. It should be noted that Ptech \"got on its feet in 1994.\" Goff implies that he left Ptech when Goff Communications began in 1994; certainly not true. Here is what Michael Goff's website says about his work there: Michael was marketing manager at Ptech, Inc., a leading provider of business process modeling, design and development software. In this capacity, Michael managed various marketing programs and activities including public relations, direct mail, Web development, collateral, trade shows and seminars. Additionally, Michael worked closely with the Ptech sales organization to perform competiti ve analysis as well as manage lead tracking and fulfillment activities. When Michael first joined Ptech, he shared responsibilities between marketing and information systems for the company. As information systems manager, Michael handled design, deployme nt and management of its Windows and Macintosh, data, and voice networks. As part of this effort, Michael developed Lotus Notes - based systems for sales and marketing lead tracking and IS service and support requests. Michael also performed employee trainin g and handled all procurement for software, systems and peripherals. From Goff Communications website, you will notice that one of his current prize clients is an Israeli company known as Guardium. This company is located less than 5 miles from Hanscom AF B, site of MIT's Lincoln Labs and about the same distance from Boston 's Logan Airport. The Israeli presence can be seen all over MIT and Boston. Guardium, a \"database security\" firm, is clearly a Mossad operation working in a critical area - the same area that the two planes that hit the World Trade Center originated - Boston's Logan Airport. Don't take my word for it, look at who finances Guardium. Three firms, all Israeli, and all manned by Mossad agents. It should be noted that Mossad's"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com headquarters are in Herzliya. It is clear that the three firms, Cedar Fund, Veritas Venture Partners, and Stage One, are all Mossad funding outfits.

(See: Kobi Alexander and Odigo on 9 - 11) from 1999 to 2000. Bronshtein was also chairman of the investment committee of Stage One, one of the Mossad investors of Gu ardium. Do you see the links between the Israeli military intelligence and the computer crimes of 9 - 11 and the theft of elections in the United States? This is, however, just the tip of the iceberg. When I exposed the Israeli players behind Ptech, it shou ld have changed everything, at least for those who follow what happened on 9 - 11. Ptech, whose \"enterprise architecture software is designed with the express purpose of knowing everything that is going on throughout the entirety of the enterprise in real - ti me,\" was not an evil Arab company after all. It was an Israeli - run company disguised as an Arab company. Do you really think that the most critical computer networks in the U.S. government would accept and run enterprise software from a Lebanese Muslim im migrant from Massachusetts? Of course not, but there were agents on the inside, and then there was the Jewish lawyer for Worcester, Michael Goff. Another \"Arab\" cut - out company tied to 9 - 11 surfaced when I got a tip from a reader in the Fort Lauderdale ar ea of Florida. It concerned a graphics company called Next Graphics, a firm my source had done business with and which he even thought was Palestinian - owned. The facade of being a Muslim - owned firm at Next Graphics was entirely fake, like the bogus religi ous shrine they had in the entry. The principal owners of Next Graphics were Israelis and they are very closely tied to the Israelis who met with Ehud Olmert in New York on the day before September 11, 2001.

It was very clear that the people distorting the view of the Middle East were themselves Jews devoted to the very un - American political and racial agenda called Zionism, the violent and chauvinistic nationalism of Eastern European Jews which has brutally occupied Palestine since 1948. Honest and unbiased coverage of Israel and the Middle East became increasingly difficult to find in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. The sale of Ted Turner's progre ssive Cable News Network (CNN) to Gerald Levine of AOL Time Warner and the transformation of the informative Christian Science Monitor marked the end of the last independent and unbiased news outlets covering the Middle East. An ethnic minority group with a foreign agenda – Zionism – had gained monopoly control over the U.S. mass media. The Jewish monopoly of the U.S. media coincided with the United States being drawn more deeply into the Arab - Israeli conflict as the primary supporter, financier, and polit ical ally of the Zionists. This combination has been extremely detrimental for America and disastrous for the people of the region, as the criminal Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 clearly showed."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com U.S. Marines removing the dead from their bombed bar racks in Beirut, 1983. The U.S. intervention in Lebanon following the Israeli invasion was disastrous for Americans, Lebanese, and Palestinians. Aware of the increasing prevalence and dominance of Zionist Jews in the political, financial, and academic s ectors, I came to the conclusion that I was living in Jewish times. As an American raised with traditional Christian values, I realized that the culture I had grown up in was under attack and being reduced to a sub - culture. Through the Jewish - controlled m edia, a distinctly foreign and anti - Christian culture of pornography, perversion, and violence was being pushed. The producers of this \"new culture\" were primarily Jews of Eastern European origin. Through their control of the mass media, film, radio, and t elevision networks, a diet of perverse entertainment and un - American values was being force - fed to the unsuspecting American people. Concurrent with the rise of the Jewish - Zionist faction in the U.S. media was the significant increase in Jewish power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Their influence could be seen in the way the U.S. government and federal courts unfairly prosecuted innocent people, including the president of Austria, on unfounded allegations of crimes ha ving been committed decades ago against Jews in distant countries. Meanwhile, there was a noticeable increase in the number and magnitude of crimes committed by Jews in the United States and the international arena that went completely unpunished.

The lies and deception about 9 - 11 spread by the Zionist - controlled med ia have been accepted as truth by millions of Americans.

The \"War on Terror\" has also been accompanied by a massive assault on our American liberties. The controlled media has completely ignored the evidence of Israeli involvement in 9 - 11 and refused to investigate any of the unanswered questions about what really happened that day. Likewise, the media has avoided doing any serious investigation of the official version of events, which is simply not believable due to the large number of inconsistencies and complete lack of supporting evidence. As a result, the public has been left with a confusing mixture of fact, fiction, and disinformation from which the truth is ver y hard to discern. It is unacceptable for a baseless fairy tale to pass for truth while the real history is suppressed and muddled. Solving 9 - 11, this book, is my attempt to clarify this muddled history by discovering and exposing the true culprits. \"But let them go on,\" Paine wrote about the rising faction of his time, \"give them rope enough and they will put an end to their own insignificance. There is too much common sense and independence in America to be long the dupe of any faction, foreign or domes tic.\" Paine was, however, writing long before television became the most pervasive and powerful thought - control device on the planet. Given the fact that the majority of Americans now rely on television for their news and understanding of world events, I am not so sure that America will not continue to be deceived and manipulated by the Zionist faction that controls the mass media. The Jewish faction controlling the media and government has done immense and irreparable damage to our republic and national prestige. Today, our once great nation is in dire straits economically, politically, and morally. Absent a revolution or sea change in political thinking, I am not optimistic that there will be any justice for the victims and relatives of 9 - 11 or that the real culprits will ever be held accountable in a U.S. court. I am, however, convinced that the truth of 9 - 11 is of the utmost importance and that the guilty must be exposed. We all need to know who did it and how they did it. The reasons why it was done have become increasingly obvious from the criminal wars of aggression and oppressive \"homeland security\" apparatus that have followed in its wake. 9 - 11 - THE ISRAELI THESIS \"Consistency is close to being the mark of a set of true beliefs; it is at least rationally compelling.\" - Robin Waterfield on the Socratic dialectic, Gorgias , 1994 \"The worst thing in the world,\" Socrates said, \"the supreme curse, is to do wrong and not pay the penalty for it.\" I firmly believe that the available evidence and facts are sufficient to disprove the official version and that the truth of 9 - 11 is within our reach.

Finding the truth about 9 - 11 requires using the Socratic method to ask questions and develop a thesis from what can be proven to be true. Since the day it happened, I have been asking questions about Israeli involve ment in 9 - 11 because of the early and clear evidence, made public, of prior knowledge by the five dancing Israelis and members of an Israeli instant messaging network called Odigo. From the beginning, therefore, I considered the possibility that 9 - 11 was a n Israeli - produced false - flag terror spectacle. The Zionists, after all, have a long history of doing these kinds of things. I investigated and researched to see if the evidence supported this thesis. I found a great deal of evidence consistent with the I sraeli thesis, which I have examined since the day of the crime. I have discovered that agents of Israeli military intelligence or people devoted to the Zionist cause occupied every key position in the 9 - 11 cover - up. This consistency has led me to believe that the Israeli thesis is correct. \"THE MAGNITUDE OF PLANNING\" Some day, perhaps, if it's decided that the stories can be told, you'll see that the state [Israel] has been involved in acts which are a thousand times more dirty than anything going on in Colombia . But these things were decided by the government, in cabinet meetings. As long as the government decides to do something, something that the national interest demanded, then it is legitimate. But if an individual wants to do the same thing, it is n't. That's just the way it is. It's very simple. - Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eitan, Israeli Chief of Staff, 1978 - 83 \"The Colombia Connection,\" Jerusalem Post , September 1, 1989 In December 2001, I spoke with Eckehardt Werthebach, the former head of the Verfassungsschutz , the domestic branch of German intelligence, about the terror attacks of 9 - 11. \"The deathly precision\" and \"the magnitude of planning\" behind the attacks would have required \"years of planning,\" Werthebach said. Such a sophisticated ope ration, he said, would have required the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization, something not found in the \"loose group\" like the one allegedly led by Mohammed Atta while he studied in Hamburg. The nebulous Al Qaida and the Taliban of Afghanis tan clearly lacked the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization. Many people would have been involved in the planning of such an operation and the absence of leaks was a further indication that the attacks were \"state organized actions,\" Wertheb ach said. Andreas von Buelow, the former head of the parliamentary commission that oversaw the German intelligence agencies, told me that a sophisticated false - flag operation like 9 - 11 has an organizational structure with three basic levels: architectural , operational, and working. Atta and the nineteen Arabs blamed as the \"hijackers\" of 9 - 11 were part"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com of the working level, von Buelow said, and were simply part of the deception. That is, after all, how false - flag terror works. Von Buelow said that he beli eved that the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service, was behind the terror attacks of 9 - 11. These attacks, he said, were designed to turn public opinion against the Arabs, and to boost military and security spending. Six years later, with more tha n one thousand billion U.S. taxpayer dollars wasted on the fraudulent \"war on terror\" and the disastrous and costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is no question that 9 - 11 has been crassly exploited to push military and security spending through the r oof. \"You don't get the higher echelons,\" von Buelow said, referring to the \"architectural structure,\" which masterminds such false - flag terror attacks. At this level, he said, the organization doing the planning, such as Mossad, is primarily interested in affecting public opinion. It goes without saying that the mass media must be tightly controlled in order for such large - scale deception to succeed. \"Ninety - five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the world is deception and disinfo rmation,\" von Buelow said, which is widely propagated in the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events. \"Journalists don't even raise the simplest questions,\" he said, adding, \"Those who differ are labeled as crazy.\" TERROR AS DECEPTION \"Terror is theatre.\" - John Le Carré, The Little Drummer Girl , 1983 \"Terror is theatre and theatre is illusion\" is the theme of The Little Drummer Girl , the realistic novel about Israeli false - flag operations in Europe written by the late John Le Carré. \"On the old reality we impose the new fiction,\" said Joseph, the Israeli agent in the book engaged in creating a false history for a Palestinian \"terrorist\" in the same way false histories were created for the 9 - 11 \"hijackers\". \"Terror is theatre ,\" another character says. \"We inspire, we frighten, we awaken indignation, anger...The guerrilla is the great actor of the world.\" Illusion is what theatre is all about, the main character, a British actress, says: \"Theatre's a con trick. Do you know what that means? Con trick? You've been deceived.\" Le Carré gave a \"sincere thanks\" to \"certain past and serving officers\" of Israeli intelligence in his forward to the book. He expressed \"special gratitude\" to General Shlomo Gazit, the former chief of Israeli military intelligence. The Israeli characters in The Little Drummer Girl come through without a scratch while Palestinians and Europeans are blown to bits in engineered false - flag terrorism. In one scene, a kidnapped Palestinian is put into the trunk of a car, which is then exploded at a rest area on the German Autobahn."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Similar Israeli techniques have long been used in \"suicide bombs\" in occupied Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan to kill and maim thousands of innocent people and foment sectarian violence. The controlled media routinely blames these terrorist bombings on \"suicide bombers\" – without any examination of the evidence. \"Of the Palestinians,\" whose real - life stories informed the plot of The Little Drummer Girl , \"some are dead, others are taken prisoner, the rest presumably are for the most part homeless or dispersed,\" Le Carré wrote in July 1982, as the Israeli military, led by the Zionist terrorist and war criminal Ariel Sharon, carried out new atrocities on a daily basis in Lebanon. Thousands of Palestinian refugees, driven from thier h omes and villages by Zionist terrorism in 1947 - 48, were slain in the Israeli - orchestrated massacre of Sabra and Shatila camps in September 1982. An Israeli commission found Sharon personally responsible and he was judged unfit to serve in government, yet 1 8 years later, as a war criminal and genocidaire , he became prime minister of Israel. Sharon, a well - known genocidaire from the extreme right - wing Likud party became prime minister of Israel in early 2001 as George W. Bush entered the White House as an un - elected president, creating the same dangerous political and ideological conjunction that had produced the illegal inv asion of Lebanon in 1982. THE \"FIXED FRAME\" OF 9 - 11 If one accepts Werthebach's expert judgment that \"the magnitude of planning\" behind 9 - 11 required the \"fixed frame\" of a state intelligence organization, then there should be evidence of such an organiz ation connecting the key players of the operational network behind the crime. If we can only discern some elements or identify some of the key people in this network, we should be able to discover other key people involved in the organization through their mutual connections. In order to carry out the sophisticated terror attacks of 9 - 11, the architects would have had to create an organizational structure in the United States over a period of years, or even decades. This structure is needed to connect the key individuals and crucial points"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com of the crime, including those involved in the on - going non - investigation and cover - up. All the bases have to be covered. The organizational structure is required to provide secure channels or \"pipelines\" for the criminal organization, the conduits through which the terror operation is set up and carried out. A secure conduit could be a company, a group of people, or even a single individual. The most important thing is that it be wholeheartedly devoted to the organizatio n. When the 9 - 11 structure was complete and the wiring in place, the switch was thrown and the long - planned terror atrocity became real. There is simply no evidence whatsoever that any such \"Al Qaida\" or Islamic terrorist structure ever existed in the Uni ted States or that any Muslim or Arab organization was interested in or capable of carrying out such a sophisticated attack. There is, on the other hand, a great deal of evidence that an Israeli military structure, which employs Arab disguises when necessa ry, is behind 9 - 11. This network connects the highest officers and veterans of Israeli military intelligence with all the key players, companies, and funding entities involved in setting up the 9 - 11 attacks. There is evidence of an Israeli military intel ligence matrix connecting every key player and entity behind 9 - 11. At the most crucial position in U.S. law enforcement, for example, where executive decisions were made concerning the federal non - investigation, sat Michael Chertoff, an Israeli whose mothe r was one of the first agents of Israeli intelligence. Having the devoted Zionist Michael Chertoff in the key position as Assistant Attorney General controlling the criminal division of the Department of Justice gave the Israelis the operational security t o carry out this massive crime without fear of exposure or prosecution. It should be noted that Chertoff played a key role in the prosecution of the 1993 false - flag terror bombing at the World Trade Center. Michael Chertoff, son of a Mossad agent and an orthodox rabbi, is an Israeli national. As Asst. Attorney General running the Criminal Division at the Dept. of Justice in 2001, he supervised the \"non - investigation\" of 9 - 11.

Small wonder there has yet to be a single trial for any of the ninety - six families who ch ose to seek justice through the courts rather than accept the government pay - out for the loss of their loved ones. By the 7th anniversary of 9 - 11, fewer than seven of the original ninety - six cases remained to be settled and no trial was forthcoming for any of the victims of 9 - 11. A year later, there were only three cases left to be settled. This can hardly be called justice for the relatives. As they say, \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\" The appalling absence of any significant investigation or disco very, the egregious acts of confiscation and criminal destruction of evidence, the escape or removal of all Israeli suspects, and the use of unwarranted secrecy measures to block discovery in the federal investigation and litigation processes of the worst terror attack in U.S. history, all indicate the presence of an Israeli - based terror structure being protected from exposure. It stands to reason that the terror network being protected by high - level Zionist agents is itself a Zionist structure. If it were truly an Arabic, Islamic, or even American criminal network, it would have been exposed long ago. The fact that the terror network behind 9 - 11 has been protected from the beginning by Zionist agents and the controlled media strongly suggests it is an orga nization to which they are highly dedicated and devoted. There were certainly early and clear indications of Israeli involvement, particularly in the form of the five dancing Israelis and the instant messages conveyed, presumably in Hebrew, on the Israeli - owned Odigo text messaging system which warned recipients of an imminent terror attack at the World Trade Center.

This is the crucial connection that has helped expose the larger Israeli military intelligence network working be hind the 9 - 11 scene. Through Goff's connection to Guardium, we can see how a nexus of senior officers of Israeli military intelligence agencies links all the key elements of 9 - 11. This connection also explains how dodgy Israeli enterprise spy software wou nd up on critical U.S. government and military computer networks. Ptech is the allegedly Arab - owned and Saudi - financed company whose enterprise software found its way onto the most critical computer networks of the U.S. government and military. By 2002, P tech reportedly provided software to more than eighteen federal agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Treasury, Customs Service, Secret Service, Department of Energy, Army, Navy, Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Postal Service – and even NA TO. Investigators from the U.S. Customs Service searched Ptech's office on December 6, 2002. Federal authorities were reportedly concerned about Ptech's ties to a Saudi named Yassin Al - Qadi (a.k.a. Al - Kadi). Qadi's name had been added to the UN blacklist on October 19, 2001. Daniel Glaser, a Jewish deputy assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes at the U.S. Treasury, described Al - Qadi in Congressional testimony in 2004 as a \"key terrorist financier and facilitator.\" In December 2007, after an investigation that lasted six years and two months, Yassin Abdullah Al - Qadi was exonerated of all charges by judicial authorities in Switzerland. Al - Qadi's funds had been unfairly frozen for six years based merely on the reckless accusation s of Daniel Glaser, an irresponsible Zionist at the U.S. Treasury who went on to negotiate the freezing and thawing of North Korean funds. Daniel Glaser, Deputy Asst. Secretary of Treasury, in Beijing in December 2006; In 2001, Glaser supervised the Dep artment of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes. How a Lebanese Muslim immigrant funded by a Saudi suspected of being \"a sponsor of terrorism\" ever sold enterprise software to the entire U.S. government is never addressed by those, like Indira Singh, who promoted the post 9 - 11 myth that Ptech was"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com a central part of the Arab nexus of terror. Singh is a bit of a mystery. Why did she promote the Arab terrorism story without any evidence other than baseless accusations provided by Jewish insiders? The dis covery that Goff was actually the key person at Ptech, that he was Ptech's original marketing director, and that he was the person responsible for \"procuring\" software for Ptech should have demolished the Arab myth. My revelation that Goff was working for Guardium, a software company run by Israeli military intelligence officers, was ignored by the \"whistle blowers\" who had pushed the Arab myth, as well as by supposedly non - partisan investigators of 9 - 11. The Ptech - Guardium connection through Michael Goff, however, is a key link to the terror structure behind 9 - 11. Ptech enterprise software, which has spy, surveillance, and intervention capabilities - according to \"experts\" like Singh - was running on nearly all of U.S. government computer networks at the t ime of 9 - 11. Goff, who had procured all software for the \"Arab - owned\" Ptech and who had been responsible for marketing Ptech's enterprise software, went on to work for Guardium, a company that is a branch of the research and development department of the Israeli Air Force. What's the connection? WHO IS GUARDIUM? Guardium is a spin - off of Log - On Software, an Israeli military intelligence company based in Ramat Gan, Israel. Log - On Software was founded by Major Gil Migdan and Joseph Segev, the former head programmer and telecommunications officer for the Israeli Navy. The vice president of the company is Danny Zeitouny, the head of logistics programming for the Israeli military, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Michael Goff's working relationship with Amit Yoran and the Israeli i ntelligence operation known as Guardium, Inc. is an excellent example of a high - level Israeli military intelligence \"channel\" in the United States. I don't have specific information about exactly when Goff's relationship with Israeli military intelligence began, but I would assume it began sometime prior to 1994 when he suddenly left his law practice and began working \"for the Arabs\" at Ptech. Goff's father and grandfather were both highest - level Freemasons in the International (Jewish) Order of the B'nai B'rith (a.k.a. Benai Berith), an exclusive Jewish - Zionist (i.e. closed to non - Jews) order of Freemasons founded in New York City in 1843. A SON OF B'NAI B'RITH The B'nai B'rith is a secretive, but extremely powerful and influential order of Freemasonry. It is, for example, the parent organization of the Anti - Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith (ADL), which has a great deal of influence with legislators and law enforcement agencies across America. It is also the parent of Hillel, an organization for Jew ish students found on virtually every college campus in the United States. The New York Times can be called a B'nai B'rith newspaper due to its ownership by the Sulzberger family, one of the leading families of B'nai B'rith Lodge No. 1 in New York City . Go ff's relationship with the Israelis who created Guardium appears to have been the channel through which Israeli spy software was provided to Ptech. The resulting Israeli - Ptech enterprise spy software was then installed onto the most critical computer netw orks of the U.S. government in the years prior to 9 - 11."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com \"The boy's job in this operation is to play cut - out,\" the Mossadnik in The Little Drummer Girl says. \"That's all he does. He breaks the circuit.\" In real life, Goff played the \"cut - out\" at Ptech; he was the American connection between the Israeli military programmers and the crucial computer networks of the U.S. military. At the time that Goff worked for Ptech, Yoran was Network Security Manager at the Department of Defense designing computer security for the Pentagon. In this position, Yoran was ideally situated to arrange the installment of Ptech software onto the critical computer systems of the U.S. military. The Israeli nexus between Michael Goff, Ptech, Guardium, and Amit Yoran provides a logical explanation for how Israeli Ptech enterprise \"spy\" software wound up on the critical computer networks of the U.S. government and military. Guardium is closely connected with other companies of the Israeli military intelligence network in the United Stat es. Some of the key Israeli - run companies linked to Guardium are Amdocs, ViryaNet, Nice Systems, and CreoScitex. Like Guardium, these companies are all run by senior officers of Israeli military intelligence. Amdocs and Nice Systems are especially notewor thy because these two companies were involved in the espionage network of computer programmers and demolition experts from the Israeli military who posed as art students as they tried to infiltrate offices of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 2000 and 2001, according to a leaked DEA document from the summer of 2001 concerning this spying activity. The \"most activity\" of the Israeli operation aimed at infiltrating offices of the DEA was \"reported in the state of Florida,\" according to the report. \"T he Hollywood, Florida area seems to be a central point for these individuals with several having addresses in this area,\" the DEA report said. Hollywood is also the area which connected fifteen of the nineteen Arab \"hijackers\" of 9 - 11. If the \"art student \" operation is connected to 9 - 11, as it seems to be, then Amdocs and Nice Systems are also involved. \"A majority of those [Israeli \"art students\"] questioned has stated they served in military intelligence, electronic signal intercept, or explosive ordinance units. Some have been linked to high - ranking officials in the Israeli military. One was the son of a two - star general, one served as the bodyguard to the head of the Israeli Army, one served in a Patriot missile unit. That these people are now travelling in the U.S. selling art seems not to fit their background,\" the U.S. DEA investigators concluded. One of the Israeli agents was 27 - year - old Lt. Peer Segalovitz, a platoon leader with Israeli special forces 605 Battalion in the Golan Heights. Segalovitz and the eighty - man platoon he commanded specialized in demolition. \"Segalovitz acknowledged he co uld blow up buildings, bridges, cars and anything else that he needed too,\" according to the report."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com If the Israeli \"art student\" intelligence operation is connected to 9 - 11, then the prevalence of military computer programmers and demolition experts amon g the agents would make sense given the evidence that the terror attacks of 9 - 11 required a great deal of expertise with computer networks and explosives. NICE SYSTEMS Nice Systems, Inc., the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of an Israeli company with the sa me name, was headed by Brigadier General Shlomo Shamir from April 2001 when he became President and Chief Executive Officer. This is the precisely the time when Israeli employees of Nice Systems and Amdocs were caught trying to infiltrate Drug Enforcement Agency and other U.S. government buildings posing as art students. General Shamir certainly must have been aware that his employees had been sent to the United States where they were arrested for illegal spying activity prior to 9 - 11. Israeli Brigadier General Shlomo Shamir General Shamir \"built and led the planning division in the IDF [Israeli military] headquarters and served as Israel‘s military attaché to Germany\" until 1994, when he began working at Scitex America Corp., which he headed from 1997, and which later became CreoScitex America, Inc.

The explosive charges and Thermite that evidently demolished the three towers could not have possibly been placed in the buildings without the perpetrators having complete control of security.

O'Sullivan said he acted after a reporter inquired about the contract and Atwell's pr esident, Avraham Bendor, acknowledged that he was also known as Avraham Shalom. Atwell, a subsidiary of the Eisenberg Group [Shaul Eisenberg of the Mossad], had been chosen \"largely on the basis of Bendor's credentials,\" O'Sullivan said.

Malkin was, after all, a legendary figure among Zionist Jews. Malkin was one of the Israeli intelligence agents involved in the kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires in 1960. Malkin later wrote a book entitled Eichmann In My Hands about his role in the kidnapping. It was none other than I sser Harel, then head of the Mossad, who had sent Malkin and six others on the mission to find Eichmann, where previous agents had failed. Harel had worked closely with Shimon Peres and Teddy Kollek in the pre - state Haganah militia of the 1940s when they had been responsible for procuring weapons and smuggling them to Zionist forces. MOSSAD: AMERICA IS THE ENEMY Other agents on the seven - person Mossad team involved in the Eichmann kidnapping were Avraham Shalom Ben - Dor and Rafael \"Dirty Rafi\" Eitan, the senior Mossadnik [not the Chief of Staff with the same name], who ran the Jonathan Pollard espionage operation against the United States in the 1980s.

Eitan said he has close relations with senior Cuban leaders, including Fidel Castro, and has helped develop Cuba's agricultural infrastructure with Israel i irrigation equipment, chemicals, pesticides and fertilizers, along with agricultural advisers. According to Eitan, the ten Israelis actively doing business in Cuba for the past five years [1992 - 97] \"have more influence than Russia had in the last thirty years.\" The business has developed Cuba's corn, citrus fruit and tomato farming for export, and Eitan represented \"a long list of Israeli companies in Cuba.\" \"We are changing agriculture in Cuba,\" Eitan said, adding that his business violated the U.S. e mbargo and had made U.S. officials \"very angry.\" He declined to identify his business partners in Cuba, citing a U.S. law that penalizes foreigners doing business in Cuba who use confiscated American property.

Maurice Greenberg and Jules Kroll are connected to the key players of 9 - 11 in so many ways that their connections would fill a book. For the purpose of this chapter, however, there are a few key connections that need to be underlined:  Maurice Greenberg and Jules Kroll became partners in 1993, the same year Kroll Associates \"was chosen over three other companies to advise the Port Authority on a redesign of its security procedures.\" \"We ha ve such confidence in them that I have followed every one of their recommendations,\" Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority executive director, told the New York Times in 1994.  Kroll controlled security at the World Trade Center complex in 2001 and was res ponsible for hiring John O'Neill, the former chief of counterterrorism for the FBI, who died on 9 - 11, reportedly his first day on the new job.  Greenberg's son, Jeffrey W. Greenberg, became CEO of Marsh & McLennan (MMC) in 1999 and chairman in 2000. The fi rst plane of 9 - 11 flew directly into the secure computer room of Marsh (Kroll) USA, part of Greenberg's company. Mark Wood, an eyewitness, said: \"It looked like a mid - sized executive jet and the way it turned suggested it was being aimed deliberately at a target.\"  Lewis \"Jerry\" Bremer, the U.S. proconsul who ran occupied Iraq until the end of June 2004, joined Marsh Kroll's crisis group shortly after 9 - 11.

The operation describes itself as, \"two Delaware limited partnerships focused on equity investments in Israel - related privately held and publicly traded companies.\""},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The Challenge Fund was founded in July 1995. A second fund, The Challenge Fund - Etgar II L.P., was established in 1999. The funds claim to have a capital base in excess of $200 million, \"making them one of Israel's leading sources of private investment capital.\" Challenge Fund investors include \"a highly distinguished group of American and European investors,\" primarily members of the extended Bronfman and Andreas families. Charles de Gunzburg, for example, a Bronfman cousin, is on the funds ' \"investment committee.\" Bronfman, which means distiller in Yiddish, is the family behind Seagram's, the Canadian whisky company.

As a longtime observer of Israel and the Middle East, I have watched how the U.S. mass media has increasingly become an instrument of Israeli propaganda. As Zionists have extended their grip on American media networks, the major television, radio, film and print media outlets have effectively become propaganda tools of a foreign state - Israel - and are used to manipulate U.S. public opinion to support the Zionist agenda. The painfully obvious anti - Arab and anti - Islamic bias of Hollywood films and news - rela ted programs has become ever more extreme as pro - Israel Zionists have achieved near total control of the U.S. mass media. It needs to be understood that the Zionist conquest of the U.S. mass media did not simply happen by chance or as a result of natural market forces. It is the planned result of a long - term covert strategy put into effect decades ago by the government of Israel to control the news and entertainment networks that inform how Americans view Zionism , Israel, and the Middle East . The Zionists realized that if they could control what Americans read, see, and hear about Zionism and the Middle East, they would be able to control how Americans think about these subjects. Controlling U.S. public opinion is crucial to realizing the Zionist agenda. Rupert Murdoch's media empire acts as a Zionist propaganda network. Zionist control of the major media networks has resulted in Americans getting an extremely distorted and biased view of the world, particularly of the Middle East, and of such significant events as 9 - 11 and the \"War on Terror.\" Understanding the strategy and the people behind the Zionist conquest of the American mass media is an essential step to recovering our national sovereignty."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com As an independent journalist and researcher of 9 - 11, I have seen how Zionist - controlled media outlets are actively engaged in covering up the evidence of Israeli involvement in the \"false flag\" attacks of 9 - 11 and the Zionist - planned \"War on Terror.\" I have personally been subjected to slander and d efamation from a host of Zionist - controlled news outlets, including CNN and FOX News, simply because I have investigated and written about the evidence of Israeli involvement in 9 - 11. Today, the United States of America is by all appearances an Israeli - oc cupied state. The U.S. Congress dutifully authorizes the annual payment of an immense tribute to Israel, some three thousand million dollars a year. Like a subservient colony, the United States provides hundreds of thousands of young men and women to figh t and die as mercenaries in Zionist - planned wars in the Middle East. The tens of thousands of American and European Christian soldiers and mercenaries fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are very similar to the former Mamluks of Baghdad - captured \"male white slaves\" serving their Zionist rulers. This dismal situation is, of course, not new. It has only become more obvious and extreme. The United States has provided more than $108 billion in direct aid to the state of Israel since 1949 ( Washington Report , Jul y 2006) and the U.S. State Department recently promised the Israeli military another $30 billion over the next ten years - a twenty - five percent increase. Hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. soldiers have died as a result of serving on or near the front l ines in Israel's wars. The 241 American marines killed in the Beirut bombing of 1983 and the 34 servicemen killed during the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS Liberty are the first that come to mind. More than 4,000 American men and women have died during th e current phase, the occupation stage, of the nearly two - decade - long war against Iraq. The U.S. - led invasion and occupation of Iraq, an illegal war of aggression, is clearly a Zionist - planned war in which Americans and other mercenaries actually do the fig hting -- and dying. WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE? The obvious question is where is the outrage? Where is the spiritual, intellectual, and political resistance to this blatant exploitation of Americans and their national resources by a tiny foreign state with a m ilitant and racist ideology? Why do patriotic Americans tolerate this abuse of the \"land of the free and the home of the brave?\" While the power of the Israeli lobby (and an occasional murder) may explain the lack of any significant political resistance i n the U.S. Congress to Zionist demands, it cannot explain how the American population has come to accept this extremely bizarre and abusive relationship with a foreign state. How has Zionist control of the United States been foisted onto the American peop le?"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com ZIONIST DECEPTIONS Many Americans willingly accept the extremely one - sided and abusive relationship with Israel because they have internalized three fundamental Zionist deceptions, which have been forced into their brains by the controlled mass media . The first deception is the religious hoax that equates the modern state of Israel with the Israel of the Bible. This religious fraud elevates modern - day Israelis, regardless of their actual ethnicity, to being the rightful heirs of the Promised Land. Al though this hoax is quickly revealed to anyone who actually reads Zionist history, it has been successfully foisted onto millions of extremely naïve and gullible Christians. These misled and abused people are often referred to as Christian Zionists. The s econd fundamental Zionist deception is that Israel is a \"sister democracy\" of the United States and that Israelis and Americans share the same \"democratic\" values. This lie is also quickly exposed by reading Israeli history or visiting Israeli - occupied Pal estine. The only Americans who could possibly share Israeli values are those who believe in Jewish racism and supremacism -- the central pillar of the Zionist worldview that is completely un - American. The third Zionist deception is that nineteen Arab Musl ims under the leadership of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Osama Bin Laden were behind the 9 - 11 attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. This deception has been used to usher in the Zionist - planned \"War on Terror,\" which has brought U.S. and Europea n troops into an extensive long - term Middle Eastern war. Why hasn't the media interviewed the families of the nineteen suspected hijackers? Why does the media not demand an open trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged \"mastermind\" of 9 - 11, currently held by the U.S. in Guantanamo? Why is the media treatment of these people only as deep as their photos? While the first two deceptions are primarily philosophical in nature and rather pointless to argue, the 9 - 11 deception is painfully real and somethin g we accept and allow to continue at our own peril. \"AUSCHWITZ OF THE MIND\" These Zionist deceptions, which are all demonstrably false, have been carefully planted and cultivated in the minds of millions of people through the devices of the Zionist - contr olled media. Zionist domination of the mass media and academia in the United States is so pervasive that Americans are subjected, like Truman Burbank in the film The Truman Show , to a constant barrage of multi - level deception, as if the entire population were living in a false construction -- an \"Auschwitz of the mind.\""},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Like the false world of Truman Burbank, the Zionist - created worldview is so overwhelming that it prevents many people from ever realizing that they are being held mentally captive. Even wh en we peel away the layers of deception and expose the fraud, somehow the show goes on. For the criminals in high places, the show must go on. The first deception, the religious hoax of the Zionist state's connection to the biblical Israel, is doctrine to television evangelists like Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition, while the second and third have become \"conventional wisdom\" for the U.S. news and entertainment media. Because millions of Americans have accepted and internalized these Zionist - crea ted falsehoods, they are unable to understand the actual realities of the Middle East or the massive fraud of the \"War on Terror.\" The controlled media is careful to censor any information that might disturb the perverse worldview of America's Christian an d Jewish Zionists who are kept in the darkness like children locked in a closet. ZIONISM - \"THE REAL ENEMY OF THE JEWS\" When, for example, the highly - regarded Israeli historian Avi Shlaim wrote his 2005 editorial entitled \"Is Zionism today the real enemy of the Jews?\" his comments were published in the International Herald Tribune (IHT), which is read in 180 nations, but ke pt out of the pages of the New York Times , the domestic newspaper of its parent company. Now, why would the New York Times , whose motto is \"All The News That's Fit to Print,\" censor the viewpoint of a renowned Israeli historian writing on the causes of modern anti - Semitism? What did Shlaim say that the editors at the Times thought was unfit for Americans to read? \"Israel's image today is negative not because it is a Jewish state but because it habitually transgresses the norms of acceptable international behavior. Indeed, Israel is increasingly perceived as a rogue state, as an international pariah, and as a threat to world peace,\" Shlaim, an Iraqi Jew who was born in Baghdad, wrote. \"This perception of Israel is a major factor in the recent resurgence of anti - Semitism in Europe and in the rest of the world. In this sense, Zionism today is the real enemy of the Jews.\" When one understands that the primary function of the Zionist - controlled media is to keep Americans in the dark about the Middle East and Zionism, it becomes clear why Shlaim's article was published in the international publication owned by the New York Times b ut kept from their U.S. readership. Shlaim's comments would have greatly disturbed the carefully cultivated Zionist worldview of millions of Americans - both Jews and Gentiles - an audience that is both protected and held captive. THE MEDIA COVER - UP OF 9 - 11"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com As an independent journalist I have seen how many important stories have been covered - up or ignored by the controlled media. I have written about many of these suppressed stories, such as the sinking of the Estonia , the downing of Flight TWA 800, and t he dangers of depleted uranium. At the top of my list is the most egregious and criminal cover - up of the evidence of 9 - 11. \"Ninety - five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the world is deception and disinformation,\" German intelligence expert Andreas von Bülow told me in December 2001. This deception is widely propagated in the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events. \"Journalists don't even raise the simplest questions,\" he said. \"Those who differ are labeled as crazy.\" After the London press conference during Jimmy Walter's 2005 European 9 - 11 Truth tour, two reporters from the BBC were eager to interview me. \"Why are you the only journalist who does not believe the official explanation of what happened on 9 - 11?\" was t heir first question. The BBC interviewing the author in London \"If that is the case,\" I told them, \"it is probably due to the fact that others who have questioned the official version have lost their jobs as a result.\" The van was leaving for the hotel so I decided to cut the interview short. I could see where the interview was heading. When FOX News and CNN interviewed me on the pretense that they were interested in my 9 - 11 research and evidence, all they really wanted to do was to smear me as an"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com anti - Semite. In both cases the interviewers were clearly not at all interested in the 9 - 11 evidence or my research. Alan Samuel Colmes, a Jewish talking head for Fox News, was not interested in discussing the evidence of 9 - 11 but only in trying to smear the author as an anti - Semite. \"WOE BETIDE HIM...\" \"The dissident cannot be taken seriously,\" the veteran British journalist Roland Huntford wrote about the mass media in his book The New Totalitarians . \"There is a range of tolerated opinions, and a narrow on e it is: woe betide him who departs from it.\" While Huntford was writing about the controlled media of Sweden in the 1970s, his comments hold true for the Zionist - controlled mass media in the United States today, particularly when the subject is 9 - 11 or I srael. I, for example, have paid a very high price for investigating and writing about the evidence that contradicts the government's version of what happened on 9 - 11. The first attack came from the Anti - Defamation League of B'nai B'rith (ADL) in November 2001. The ADL, a private organization dedicated to supporting Zionist and Israeli interests,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com first smeared the American Free Press , the newspaper I wrote for, as a \"conspiratorial and anti - Semitic weekly newspaper,\" which it said had \"repeatedly turned t o the subject of the 9 - 11 attacks as grist for its mill.\" The ADL then singled me out for my article, \"Some Survivors Say Bombs Exploded Inside WTC\" in which, the ADL said, \"Bollyn suggests that the 'mainstream media' is ignoring eyewitness accounts of bo mbs that exploded inside the World Trade Center before the collapse of the Twin Towers.\" Indeed, the first line of my article from September 2001 said exactly that: Despite reports from numerous eyewitnesses and experts, including news reporters on the s cene, who heard or saw explosions immediately before the collapse of the World Trade Center, there has been virtual silence in the mainstream media. But, I asked, why would an organization dedicated to Israeli and Jewish interests attack me, as a journali st, for writing about eyewitness reports of explosions in the World Trade Center? What did my writing about this extremely newsworthy subject have to do with Israel or Jews? Had my BBC interview gone on, I might have asked why the BBC editors had ignored and censored the comments of their own reporter, Steve Evans, who had been in the South Tower (WTC 2) when it was hit and who reported having observed a \"series of explosions. \" Shortly after the destruction of the WTC, the BBC interviewed Evans on their television news program based in London. Because Evans' observations were ignored by the BBC and not followed up, I wrote about his report of the explosions he felt in the Sout h Tower: Evans was asked what he had seen: \"It's more what I felt really,\" Evans said. \"I was at the base of the second tower - the second tower that was hit. There was an explosion – I didn‘t think it was an explosion – but the base of the building sh ook. I felt it shake ... then when we were outside, the second explosion happened and then there was a series of explosions...\" [At this point the London news anchor cut Evans off in mid - sentence rather than listen to Evans continue to describe the \"series of explosions\" that he saw and felt. Evans' microphone was turned down.] But in a minute Evans returns to the \"series of explosions\" that he witnessed: \"We can only wonder at the kind of damage – the kind of human damage – which was caused by those explos ions – those series of explosions,\" Evans said. Evans is a professional journalist and his observations of explosions in the South Tower need to be taken into account by anybody looking into the cause of the catastrophe of September 11. Many eyewitnesses reported similar explosions, but these reports, and"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com what they suggest, are intentionally being censored and avoided by the very people who are supposed to be investigating the cause of the collapses. The same kind of censorship occurred with FOX News, CNN , and the leading U.S. news networks that had reporters at the World Trade Center. First - hand reports of explosions at the WTC from professional reporters were broadcast only once -- and never picked up again, except by the much - despised \"conspiracy theori sts.\" The news reports that five Middle Eastern men were being sought or had been captured in New Jersey after they had videotaped themselves celebrating in front of the burning towers were treated in the same way. The arrest of the five men, all Israelis , two of whom were known Mossad agents, was only reported in the Bergen Record (New Jersey ) on September 12, 2001 -- but never discussed or investigated by the national news networks. ISRAELIS FOREWARNED Likewise, the story of the Odigo text message warning of the attacks - before they occurred - was dropped into the media's memory hole. The instant text messages, which were precise to the minute, had been sent via the Israeli - owned Odigo instant messaging service and had even been received by Odigo e mployees in Israel, but the story of Israelis having prior knowledge of the attacks was never discussed in the U.S. mass media. How did the news editors at the BBC, FOX News, CNN, and the leading networks decide to censor their own reporters and avoid dis cussing certain aspects of 9 - 11? Let's look at this logically. The 9 - 11 event was the biggest story these news editors had ever handled. Suffice it to say that the editorial decisions about how to cover 9 - 11 must have been made by the boss at the top. Any decision to omit or censor reports about explosions at the World Trade Center or indications of Israeli involvement would have been made by the senior executive of each network. In the case of CNN it would have been Gerald M. Levin, the CEO of Time Warne r, who acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1997. (Levin unexpectedly announced his resignation in December 2001, less than three months after 9 - 11.) At FOX News the top decision maker would have been Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation. At ABC News it wo uld have been Michael D. Eisner, CEO of Disney, the network's parent company. Were the media moguls Murdoch, Levin, and Eisner involved in 9 - 11? How else could they know that certain aspects of the event needed to be suppressed by their news networks? The ir networks have been suppressing important information about 9 - 11 since the day of the event. They have also been actively involved in a conspiracy to cover - up the truth. How can that be? Who is behind this cover - up? What occult power, what hidden hand, would be able to communicate"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com with these men and influence them to suppress important reports and evidence from the terror attacks of 9 - 11? ARNON MILCHAN - MOSSAD'S MAN IN THE MIDDLE If one considers the known evidence of Israeli prior knowledge of 9 - 11, the Odigo text messages and the five arrested Mossad agents, for example, as indicative of Israeli state involvement in the crime, the identity of the occult power behind the cover - up is rather obvious. The \"hidden hand\" suppressing the information about 9 - 11 would have to be a high - level person in the Israeli political - military intelligence establishment who also has very close relations with media kingpins like Murdoch, Levin, and Eisner. Arnon Milchan (a.k.a. Milchen) is such a person. While millions of Americans have watched his films, such as Pretty Woman and JFK , very few know that Arnon Milchan is a \"best friend\" of Shimon Peres (born Szymon Perski in Wiszniewo, Poland) the current Israeli president and godfather of Israel's nuclear arsenal. The Israeli movie producer Arnon Milchan (between Peres and Netanyahu) is a close friend of Israel's president Shimon Peres (\"his first letter he wrote as president went to me\"), Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Likud Party leader Binyamin (\"Bibi\") Netanyahu. Milchan, who began his career with the fertilizer/chemical company Milchan Brothers, reportedly owns 30 companies in 17 countries involved in plastics, electronics, communications, and pharmaceuticals. Milchan's 40 - year friendship with Peres, the man wh o oversaw the illegal development of Israel's nuclear weapon program is key to understanding Milchan's career as an undercover operative, weapons procurer, and film producer. The fact that Milchan, the"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Hollywood producer, has been Israel's \"foremost weapo ns procurer\" for decades, brokering deals for \"everything from nuclear triggers to rocket fuel to guidance systems,\" is seldom mentioned in the U.S. news media. This is probably due to the fact that Milchan is also a \"best friend\" and business partner of Rupert Murdoch. He is also a friend a business partner with Levin (Warner Brothers) and Eisner. \"I consider him one of my best friends,\" Milchan said about Murdoch, \"and I think vice versa. We're having a ball. He's a very cool guy.\" \"Kingpins like Warne r Brothers' Gerald Levin and Disney's Michael Eisner are quick to return his calls,\" the American Jewish journalist Ann Louise Bardach wrote about Milchan in her article \"The Last Tycoon\" in April 2000. In 1997, after a six - year relationship with Warner B rothers, Milchan became a partner with Murdoch, selling him twenty percent of his film company, New Regency Productions, for $200 million. Murdoch also invested another $30 million in Regency Television. Today, Murdoch's equity partnership with Milchan is close to fifty percent. \"Milchan's deal with Fox also assures him a level of financial security,\" Bardach wrote. \"With Murdoch's $200 million investment and a subsequent $600 million line of credit from a team of banks led by Chase Manhattan, Milchan is w ell into mogul territory. \"Milchan's tony offices occupy most of Building 12, right next door to the Executive Building on the Fox lot,\" Bardach wrote. \"And it is from this seat of power that Milchan is building an entertainment empire that could one day rival Murdoch's.\" Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, left, presents Arnon Milchan with a lifetime achievement award at an event"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the state of Israel in Los Angele s on September 18, 2008.

THE MILCHAN INFLUENCE The Israeli influence in films and news media has profoundly affected the quality of news reporting and entertainment. Israeli attitudes and ideas are now disseminated through national media outlets which reach the entire U.S. population on a daily basis. Israeli - made films often reveal hints or clues about actual crimes or criminal plots the Israeli producers are aware of. One such project, The Lone Gunmen , produced by Milchan's \"best friend\" Rupert Murdoch, had an uncanny resemblance to the 9 - 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Was this Milchan's influence? The Milchan - Murdoch partnership in television production may be key to understandi ng the genesis of the plot of the pilot episode of this short - lived television series. In the first episode a passenger airliner is hijacked by remote control and flown toward the World Trade Center. Disaster is averted at the last minute by over - riding th e computer program that has hijacked the plane. The Lone Gunmen , produced by Rupert Murdoch in 2000, revealed an extremely uncanny prescience of 9 - 11. During the same year it was made, Milchan was producing two television series in collaboration with Fox Television: Roswell, which aired on Warner Brothers network, an d Malcolm in the Middle, which was aired on Fox. The Lone Gunmen pilot episode aired on FOX Television in March 2001. Given the long, close, and extensive collaboration between Murdoch and Milchan, it seems fair to ask: Was Arnon Milchan the original sour ce of the plotline for The Lone Gunmen ? Why were the people involved in the production of this episode not investigated by the media? Why did the media ignore its own uncanny prescience, The Lone Gunmen episode, which mirrored reality six months later? W as the similarity between the Murdoch - produced show and reality too close for comfort? Was it too uncomfortable to discuss the origin of the idea for the show? Apparently so."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Was the Israeli chemical magnate Arnon Milchan the author of the plotline for The Lone Gunmen pilot episode in which a passenger airplane was remotely hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center? In Milchan's highly - controversial film JFK (1991), directed by Oliver Stone, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is ascrib ed to conspirators within the U.S. military - industrial complex. Whose idea was this? Why is Arnon Milchan's own connection with Itzhak Rabin, who was in Dallas on the day Kennedy was shot, not an issue here? In his futuristic film Brazil (1985), directed by Terry Gilliam, terrorist explosions go off in cafes for no apparent reason, very much like the seemingly senseless terrorism that plagues occupied Iraq. Is this Milchan's influence? \"Anyone closely associated with Peres pretty well must be satanic,\" Ba rry Chamish, a Canadian - Israeli wrote, \"but Milchan produced a film that shows he has insider information.\" Chamish advises his readers to watch The Devil's Advocate with Al Pacino to \"understand the implication.\" \"Milchan runs his company like a family b usiness. Heading up New Regency Productions for him is his childhood friend David Matalon, whose parents were best friends with Milchan's,\" Bardach wrote. \"Daughter Alexandra [Milchan - Lambert] is vice president of"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com production in Los Angeles.\" Matalon has s erved as president and CEO of New Regency Productions since 1995. In 1986, Matalon, an Israeli co - founder of Tri - Star pictures, released a film entitled Iron Eagle , in which the aerial combat scenes were filmed entirely with the Israeli Air Force. The plo t of this film is about how a few teenagers are able to steal U.S. military codes, aircraft, and information from under the noses of the military brass and run an entire military operation in which they bomb Libya without the knowledge of the military comm and. This film gives some indication of the kind of projects and ideas the Israeli military has collaborated on with their fellow Israelis in Hollywood. THE SECRETIVE MOGUL \"Averse to publicity and little known outside Hollywood\" is how Arnon Milchan's biography begins. \"My idea of a good profile is no profile,\" Milchan told Bardach. Murdoch, Levin, and Eisner have obviously respected the Israeli's wish, but why would a Hollywood mogul not want to be known to the public? \"Arnon Milchan has kept his sec rets to himself,\" Bardach wrote. Arnon Milchan with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Indeed, very little is known about Milchan, Israel's super weapons agent, except that he spends more time in Tel Aviv and France than he does in his office on the 20th Cent ury Fox lot in Los Angeles, according to Bardach. Now, why would a Hollywood movie producer spend more time in Tel Aviv, where no movies are being made, than in Hollywood? POLISH ZIONIST ROOTS"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Milchan was born on December 6, 1944, on the Zionist settleme nt of Rehovot, in what was then Palestine, according to his biography in Current Biography (2000). Rehovot, one of the earliest Zionist settlements, was founded in 1890 by Polish and Russian Jews, one of whom was Milchan's paternal grandfather. Rehovot has a street and a neighborhood named \"Milchen\", no doubt in memory of his grandfather. \"My family's been there for 500 years,\" Milchan told Bardach. \"My grandfather was a very close friend of President [Chaim] Weizmann.\" Oddly, Bardach does not provide the name of his grandfather who was \"a very close friend\" of Israel's first president. Nor does she give the name of the ancestors Milchan proudly claims have lived in Palestine for five hundred years. \"Milchan's father was an enviable success story himself, having laid the sprinklers that irrigated Israel,\" Bardach wrote. \"Later, he would handle some of Israel's lucrative military contracts, according to his son.\" Bardach continues: However, it was young Milchan who put the company on the map internation ally, after his father's sudden death. Following a spot of schooling in London and Geneva , where he excelled in soccer and tennis, Milchan dropped out and returned to Israel. Soon, he struck gold. By marketing a newly discovered nutrient that quadrupled ci trus production, he brought his company stratospheric sales throughout the world. \"This is a man who made his fortune by screwing with nature,\" says screenwriter Shawn Slovo, who began her career as Milchan's secretary in 1977. \"He's the Israeli who ma de the desert bloom. Amazing when you think about it. He could have retired at the age of 22.\" Instead, like a kid racing around the Monopoly board, Milchan gobbled up another half dozen businesses -- including electronics, chemicals, aerospace and plastics . Still in his early twenties, he met the Shah of Iran and reportedly talked the wily Persian into dozens of contracts, one to build much of Tehran's airport. When one considers that Arnon Milchan, in his early twenties, was among the founders of Israel's Labor Party in the 1960s with Shimon Peres, Moshe Dayan, and Teddy Kolleck, then one can appreciate that his contracts in Iran and his career in arms dealing and Hollywood have been done with the active collaboration of the Mossad. \"I'M AN AGENT\" Milcha n is a \"go - between for American weapons manufacturers and the Israeli government, thus playing a major role in the strengthening of the Israeli military,\" according to Current Biography (2000). \"Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and even up until the Gulf War in 1991, Milchan was Israel's foremost weapons procurer, brokering"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com deals for such prized superweapons as the Hawk missile and the famous Scud - foil of the Gulf War, the Patriot,\" Bardach wrote. \"At different times in his career, his Israeli company, Milcha n Brothers, has represented arms manufacturers such as Raytheon, North American Rockwell, Beechcraft, Bell Helicopter and Magnavox. Or, as Milchan downplays it, 'there were a bunch of them.' Nevertheless, he bristles at being called an arms dealer. 'I'm th eir rep in Israel,' he says emphatically. 'I get a fee, a commission. I'm not even the buyer. I'm an agent.' \"What we do is send my people to the United States,\" Milchan told Bardach, \"so we know what these guys are talking about, and you go back and say t o the buyer, 'I think this guy has some interesting stuff. Would you meet with him?' And then you arrange a meeting with the head of the [Israeli] air force and the head of this and the head of that.\" In 1992, Milchan was described by the Jerusalem Post a s being \"among the handful of Hollywood moguls with the muscle and money to single - handedly give the go - ahead for a new movie project. The Mossad is undoubtedly the source of much of Milchan's \"muscle and money.\" Who pays Milchan's commissions? Whether th e commission is paid by the weapon's vendor or by the state of Israel, the money going to Milchan is American money. He is paid either by the company or from the billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars provided to Israel for weapons every year. In this way, Milc han, Mossad's man in the middle, has been greatly enriched by U.S. weapons sales to Israel. \"BIG STAR\" TO RAYTHEON In 1975, for example, Milchan reportedly received an improper $300,000 commission paid by a Raytheon subsidiary for the sale of Hawk missil es. Raytheon makes the Patriot and Hawk missile systems and key components of the Global Hawk. Of particular interest is Raytheon's Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) which allow remote operators to pilot the Global Hawk from \"thousands of miles away.\" This is the kind of technology that is thought to have been used in the terror attacks of 9 - 11. Terry Gilliam told Bardach that he'll never forget a visit to the Paris Air Show with Milchan during the filming of Baron Munchausen . \"It was wonderful to see how the whole arms business worked,\" Gilliam said. \"Arnon was very psyched about the video games. He brought his son with him, who was then a teenager, to play the games, which can replicate the destruction of the planet. He took me to the Raytheon booth, and it was all showmanship. He was obviously a big star to Raytheon.\" \"Growing up, I would read that he was an arms dealer; he was in the Mossad, and he was a movie producer,\" his daughter Alexandra told Bardach. She is married to a Scott Lambert, an agent with William Morris in Beverley Hills and graduate of American"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com University in Washington, D.C. (Lambert happens to share the same name of a former Director of Manufacturing Systems at Raytheon.) MODUS OPERANDI When one looks at Milchan's career as an Israeli agent who bought media outlets with dirty money one should consider that this may be the modus operandi he has employed to gain influence and outlets in the U.S. media market. Money laundering could explain his ability to make huge deals and control media networks - and his desire for secrecy. \"He's extremely powerful because he brings money to the table,\" journalist Anita Busch wrote. \"He's unique in that way. He's got a credit line that's astronomical, like, you know, almost a billion dollars.\" Terry Gi lliam, the director of Brazil , wondered where the money came from. \"Arnon can be great, but when it comes to money there's something - I don't know - bits just don't seem to connect.\" Charles McKeown, a film writer, had a hard time getting paid by the bil lion - dollar Israeli. \"You just never know whether he was telling the truth or not,\" McKeown said. \"The kind of deals he was in, the level of finance and the way he operated, seemed to me like a world upside down. I felt we were dealing with a sort of dange rous, shady quality.\" MONEY LAUNDERER In 1975, the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak Rabin and Defense Minister Shimon Peres recruited Milchan to launder money from South Africa. Milchan \"has admitted laundering some of the more than $100 million spen t by the South Africans during the 1970s in an attempt to improve the white government's image abroad,\" according to the authors of The Iran - Contra Connection . Because both Israel and South Africa were ostracized in the 1970s, \"The money laundering was pa rt of the two countries' plan to buy newspapers and other media in various parts of the world,\" his biography reads. \"The Rabin government recruited ... Milchan to launder cash ... to purchase influential publications,\" Andrew and Leslie Cockburn wrote in their book Dangerous Liaison . THE MIDDLEMAN Milchan told Bardach he was asked by \"prominent Israelis if 'we can use your companies to make deals to buy newspapers.' I said, 'Sure. It sounds like fun.' Basically, I was used as a middleman.\" A citizen of both Israel and Monaco, he is said to control thirty companies in seventeen countries, profiting in everything from film production to the weapons trade. But how does one man control thirty companies in seventeen countries? Clearly there must be an entir e team behind these businesses. Milchan's team could be called Team Mossad. \"I'll say it in my own words,\" Milchan told Bardach. \"I love Israel, and any way"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com I can help Israel, I will. I'll do it again and again. If you say I'm an arms dealer, that's your problem. In Israel, there is practically no business that does not have something to do with defense.\" Milchan also funds Christian Zionist movements. Milchan has reportedly contributed significantly to the Christian Coalition, an organization started by the Reverend Pat Robertson, a staunch supporter of Israel. He also underwrites the Israeli Network which transmits Israeli television programs to the United States and Canada via cable and satellite. Milchan is also an owner of the Israeli television sta tion known as Channel 10. The other owners are Ronald Lauder, who like Milchan owned about twenty - five percent, and Josef (Yossi) Maiman, who owns fifty - one percent and who has been with Channel 10 since it was founded in 2003. Rupert Murdoch bought nine p ercent of Channel 10 stock from Milchan and Lauder in 2006. Maiman, a Mossad agent, owns and controls a great deal of the gas fields of Turkmenistan. One of the main goals of the occupation of Afghanistan is to build a pipeline to bring the Israeli - owned gas of Turkmenistan to India and China. (Maiman and Lauder are both linked to the Mossad and 9 - 11. For more on Maiman read my article, \"The Great Game: The War For Caspian Oil And Gas.\" Information about Lauder can be found in \"Mossad - The Israeli Connecti on To 9 - 11\") SMUGGLING NUCLEAR TRIGGERS Milchan should have been busted in 1985 for smuggling triggers for nuclear bombs, when a business associate, Richard Kelly Smyth, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of smuggling 810 kryt rons to Israel. Because krytrons are used as detonators or triggers for nuclear weapons, their export is tightly regulated. In 1973, Smyth started a company called Milco International, Inc., financed, according to the Washington Post , by Milchan, hence it s name. Up to eighty percent of Milco's business was reportedly with Milchan and Israel. In 1980, the federal indictment asserted, Smyth and Milco sent 610 krytrons to Israel without the necessary licenses, plus another 200 in 1982. The 1985 indictment i dentified the Israeli buyers of the nuclear triggers as Heli Trading Ltd. and Milchan Brothers, two of Milchan's Israel - based companies. Federal authorities told NBC News in 1993 that Milchan also shared in the profits derived from the sales. Announcement of the indictments came four days after the Israeli Defense Ministry, reacting to news of the grand jury probe, admitted that it had the devices, known as krytrons. The krytrons were shipped between 1979 and 1983 to an Israeli firm under contract to the government for defense work. The Israeli Ministry of Defense returned only 469 of the krytrons, and Smyth vanished a week before he was to appear for trial."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com PROTECTING ISRAEL Robert C. Bonner, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, refused to comment on quest ions about whether the Israeli government had been involved in the illegal actions. State Department spokesman Edward Djerejian said, \"I can only note that the indictment does not mention any Israeli citizen.\" Djerejian added that the United States \"has expressed its serious concern to the Israeli government about this alleged violation of U.S. law\" and had been assured that Israel would cooperate with the continuing U.S. investigation \"to the full extent permitted under Israeli law.\" \"Smyth's disappeara nce, and the unwillingness of Israeli officials to cooperate with U.S. investigators on the case, left federal authorities unable to proceed,\" Robert Windrem of NBC News reported in July 2001. Although Milchan is not mentioned in the indictment, a Milco e mploye, Gretel Siler, who identified herself as corporate treasurer of Milco, told the Washington Post that Milchan had been associated with Milco in various export transactions and had been involved in purchasing the krytrons from the manufacturer, EG&G, of Wellesley, Massachusetts. Milchan denied being involved in the $60,000 krytron deal, but told \"60 Minutes\" (CBS) that he had allowed the Israeli government to use his companies as conduits for trading with the United States. \"I'm not saying I'm an inno cent person - but in this specific case, I knew nothing about it,\" Milchan told Frank Rose of Premiere magazine. In any case, Milchan was never charged in the case. Robert Mainhardt, a nuclear scientist and former director of Milco, told \"60 Minutes\" that he had resigned after Milchan had asked him to obtain advanced nuclear reactor designs and a supply of uranium hexachloride, which is used in the enrichment of bomb - grade uranium. Mainhardt's fellow directors at Milco, Arthur Biehl and Ivan Getting began to feel uneasy sometime in 1982, the Washington Post reported. The Washington Post did a series of articles about this smuggling. The most important excerpts are the following: When they joined the board of directors of Milco International in 1980, Biehl and Getting recalled, they thought the company's primary business was developing aerospace software for U.S. military and space programs. They had been recruited by the company's owner, Richard K. Smyth, while serving with him on an influential panel that advises the U.S. Air Force on advanced technologies, work that required them to have top - secret clearances. But they soon realized that Smyth, a California - based computer expert, spent most of his time trying to buy equipment with military applications, including a uranium byproduct known as \"green salt\" that can be processed into weapons -"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com grade uranium, for the government of Israel. Often, they said, the sales were made through an Israeli middleman, Arnon Milchan, a flamboyant businessman who sold arms before becoming a producer of such popular movies as the recent Brazil . \"I didn't have any evidence there was a nything improper,\" Biehl said. \"I just thought it was a strange way to do business . . . . I wondered why the Israelis were paying fees to (Milco and Milchan) when they could get the same equipment directly\" using U.S. foreign aid. In late 1982, Biehl and Getting resigned from Milco's board of directors, in part because of their misgivings about Smyth's dealings with Milchan and Israel. Asked why Israel didn't buy the krytrons through its 200 - member procurement staff in New York, which buys military equipment with $1.8 billion in annual U.S. aid, Yossi Gal, spokesman with the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., told the Post that Israel occasionally used \"independent agents\" to make purchases. Under U.S. laws, Smyth needed a munitions license from the State Department to ship the krytrons overseas. If he had tried to obtain one, according to a knowledgeable State Department source, he wo uld have been turned down because Israel has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Smyth's relations with Israel began in the early 1970s when he was working for North American Rockwell as a chief engineer in its avionics division and traveled t o Israel to help set up a subsidiary. There, he met Milchan, who was Rockwell's representative and \"point man\" with the Israeli government, according to an associate of Smyth from that period. In January 1973, Smyth founded Milco while still working at Ro ckwell. His associate recalled Smyth once saying that Milchan provided money to start Milco; this associate said he believes that the name Milco was derived from Milchan. At the time that Milco was founded, former U.S. intelligence officials said, the Cen tral Intelligence Agency knew that Israel was working to perfect a solid - fuel tactical missile, known as the Jericho, that could carry nuclear warheads. In late 1973, Smyth's associate recalled, he saw Milco order forms for several barrels of a butyl compo und used to bind explosive powders into solid rocket fuel. Smyth said he was shipping the butyl to Milchan through another company he owned in Houston, the associate recalled. Smyth's next known contact with Israel occurred in 1975, about a year after he left Rockwell to run Milco full time. On Oct. 30 of that year, Smyth applied for a munitions license to ship 400 krytrons to Heli Trading Inc., Milchan's company in"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Israel. The application, which is filed in court records in Los Angeles, said that the \"e nd user\" would be Rehovot Instruments Ltd. and that the krytrons would be used as \"remotely located intrusion detectors.\" Smyth filed the application after being told by an official from an unnamed U.S. intelligence agency that a license was required, acc ording to court records. Smyth met with the official and told him that \"Arnon Milchan [had] requested that a certain number of krytrons be shipped to Israel,\" according to a letter filed by William Fahey, the prosecutor in the current case. Internal Milco records, provided by former Smyth associates, show that the company struggled financially from 1975 to 1980. It landed several small contracts for less than $25,000 with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force for studies on co mputer software for avionics systems in advanced aircraft, the MX missile and a small ship defense missile called the Patriot. It was also in 1980, the federal indictment alleged, that Milco sent 610 krytrons to Israel in 11 shipments without obtaining th e needed licenses. Smyth bought them from EG&G in Salem, Mass., the sole producer of the switches in the United States. In mid - 1981, Smyth listed several contracts with Heli Trading to acquire training simulators for Hawk air defense missiles, a voice scr ambler and lasers. He also cited \"probable\" contracts for a computerized flight control system for Israel's Lavi fighter plane, and thermal batteries and gyroscopes. James Russell, vice president of Incosym Inc., a maker of gyroscopes in Thousand Oaks, Ca lif., said he sold Milco several $10,000 gyroscopes in that period. Smyth told him the navigation aids would be used on Israeli navy patrol boats. Milco also won a flight control contract for the Lavi in 1983, according to a listing in Aviation Week magazi ne. Smyth's world started to crumble in early 1983 after someone broke into Milco's offices and took several thousand dollars worth of computer and software equipment. Because he was doing some classified U.S. government work and feared some records of it might have been stolen, Smyth wrote a lengthy report about the theft for the Pentagon and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, then - company attorney Brian R. Carter said. Milco company records revealed that Milchan's companies had ordered large quantitie s of missile - related equipment and materials between 1977 and 1982. Among the nuclear items listed were the 810 krytrons, plus neutron generators, high - speed oscilloscopes"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com and high - voltage condensers, according to a 1996 paper on Israel's Nuclear Weapon Ca pability by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. In August 1985, U.S. Customs subpoenaed the financial records linking Smyth and Milchan. The records were neither turned over nor found. Smyth and his wife disappeared just days before his schedul ed trial, which almost certainly would have involved Milchan. \"There were so many...indictments that they probably decided just to get out,\" Mainhardt, who operates a security business in Dublin, California, said. \"If I had to make a guess, I'd say they'r e in Israel.\" \"Let's assume that there's nothing that Israel and the United States do separately,\" Milchan told Bardach. \"Smyth, a U.S. fugitive for more than a decade, was last seen in Herzliya Pituach, an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv, where Milchan owns a home,\" Bardach wrote in 2000. In July 2001, Smyth was arrested in Malaga , Spain . Smyth pleaded guilty in December to one count of violating the Arms Export Control Act and one count of making a false statement to Customs agents. Proscutors dropped twen ty - eight other counts. On April 29, 2002 Smyth was sentenced to forty months in federal prison and fined $20,000 for illegally exporting to Israel the devices that are used as triggers for nuclear weapons. Smyth, 72, was immediately made eligible for par ole at his sentencing. MILCHAN AND PERES \"In Israel, Milchan spends much of his time with best friend Shimon Peres,\" Bardach wrote. She continued, \"Milchan's political connections would prove to be the foundation of his future empire. In addition to ag riculture, there would be biotechnology, advertising, aerospace, and the biggest jackpot of them all -- arms.\" Arnon Milchan is deeply engaged in chemicals and helped build Israel's nuclear arsenal,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com which was developed by his good friend Shimon Peres. What does he know about the super - thermite that demolished the World Trade Center? In 1953, at age thirty, Shimon Peres was appointed by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, to become Director - General of the Ministry of Defense. Within three ye ars, Peres had laid the foundation for Israel's nuclear weapon program, according to the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Peres started Israel's program to develop nuclear power and nuclear weapons by convincing the French to help Israel build a secret nuclear reactor beginning about 1957. He chose France as the major supplier, arranged the sale of a nuclear reactor, and spent the next decade overseeing the construction of the Dimona nuclear weapon production complex. Peres is the one who came u p with Israel's most often repeated nuclear declaration. At an April 1963 meeting in the White House, Peres responded to President John F. Kennedy's questions about Israel's nuclear program by saying: \"Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weap ons to the Middle East .\" Two years later, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol elevated Peres's words to Israel's official nuclear line.

I have also paid a very high price for my research and writing. I learned that Jewish Zionists control even small so - called nationalist newspapers. Most journalists, lawyers, and politicians are primarily interested in advancing their own careers and learn early on to accept the yoke of their Zionist masters -- or sac rifice their careers. Ambitious people put their self interest first and agree to go along with lies and corruption rather than stand up for the truth. I've seen it many times. I am not like that. During the past thirty years, I have witnessed first - ha nd the extremely brutal Israeli occupation of Palestine and seen how Zionists operate to subjugate entire nations. My years in Palestine/Israel were my political awakening. Zionist control of the mass media and Holocaust propaganda serve to protect and p romote their criminal agenda. I have watched how the people of America and Europe are deceived and forced to bear the yoke of the ruthless Zionists who control their political systems and media. Thousands of young Americans and Europeans have been maimed or lost their lives in fraudulent wars for Israel in Middle Eastern nations about which they know nothing. Naïve Americans have become merciless mercenaries of Zionism. As an American, I can't support either presidential candidate because both are clear ly Zionist puppets who espouse positions to which I am strongly opposed. American voters aren't even given a real choice about important things – like the ongoing wars in the Middle East, for example.

MOSSAD SPIED ON HAIDER Israel and the international Zionists control the political parties and news outlets not only in the United States, but Europe as well, as the recent death of Austria's Jörg Haider reveals. Oddly, Haider, the leader of Austria's Freedom Party, allowed Peter Sic hrovsky, a Jew, to serve as \"secretary - general\" of his supposedly anti - Zionist party. In 2005, The Times (UK) reported that Sichrovsky, the managing director of the party, had served as a spy for Israel's Mossad for five years. Three years later, after h is party won parliamentary elections, Haider was suddenly killed in a very suspicious car accident. ―I wanted to help Israel and certainly did not do anything wrong,‖ Sichrovsky said. ―It‘s true, though, that I co - operated with Mossad until my withdrawal from politics in 2002.‖ Sichrovsky admitted that he had spied for Mossad, a foreign intelligence agency, because he \"wanted to help Israel.\" At the same time he maintained that he did nothing wrong. This is exactly how a great many Jews feel about suppo rting Israel, even when their actions involve breaking the laws of the nations they reside in. Facing a criminal investigation and charges of spying for a foreign power, Sichrovsky quickly fled to the United States where he began a new career as \"a busine ssman concerned with military co - operation between Israel and China.\" Sichrovsky's career with Mossad evidently continued after he left Austria. If Mossad infiltrates \"third party\" movements in small nations like Austria, imagine what they do to control the two political parties in the United States. How much control does Israeli intelligence have over the major political parties in Britain and the United States? Let's look at the most obvious connections. MOSSAD CONTROLS BRITAIN The evidence indicate s that Israeli intelligence has near complete control of the leading political parties in Britain and the United States. While the Zionist political controllers in London and Washington are well known to the owners of the mass media, discussion of the sub ject of Zionist or Israeli control of the parties is censored in the media outlets they control. This censorship illustrates how Zionist control of the media serves to deceive the people and cause extreme harm to both nations. Specific examples of the cu rrent pro - Israel bias in the mass media would include the media's unquestioning support of the 9 - 11 cover - up, the costly and disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the trillion dollar \"bail - out.\" The complete lack of"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com transparency in U.S. elections a nd the secretive private companies that run our elections are also censored subjects. The Zionist conspiracy called the \"War on Terror\" and the illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have all been designed and forced onto the American and British nations by Zionists who control the political systems of London, New York, and Washington. In Britain, the two political leaders who have promoted and supported the Zionist agenda and wars of aggression are Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Their Zionist paymasters and handlers are not hard to discern, although they are never discussed in the media in such terms. \"LORD CASHPOINT\" Michael Abraham Levy, or \"Lord Levy,\" was known as \"Lord Cashpoint\" when he was the leading fundraiser for the Labour Party from 1994 to 200 7.

Under Ehud Barak, Levy served as the prime minister's special adviser and head of the Jerusalem Affairs unit. The Levy link was obviously the connection that gave Israeli intelligence control over the head of the British government - Tony Blair. Daniel Levy, Michael Levy's Israeli son \"WE HAVE TO DO IRAQ\" Before the Anglo - American occupation of Iraq turned sour, Blair was fond of recalling what he, the first foreign leader to meet George W. Bush, told the newly installed president when they met in early 2001. \"We have to do Iraq,\" is the first thing Blair told Bush, according to his own statements."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Marching orders: \"We have to do Iraq,\" is the first thing Tony Blair told Bush when they met in February 2001.

When Tony Blair and his Zionist handler \"Lord Cashpoint\" fell from power in June 2007, Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, assumed the office of prime minister, upon the approval of Queen Elizabeth II. Prior to becoming prime minister, Brown had served ten years as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the minister responsible for economic and financial matters in Britain. Prime Minister Brown, in turn, is bankrolled and controlled by Lord Ronald Cohen, who has replaced the beleaguered and disgraced Lord Levy.

So, who is Peter Richard Orszag and what kind of decisions will he ma ke with the budget he controls? Based on his background one would be well advised to prepare for a financial train wreck. Peter Orszag has an interesting resume. He has played key roles in some of the biggest financial scandals of our time. Orszag was, for example, an advisor to the Russian Finance Ministry during the reign of the Jewish oligarchs as they plundered the wealth of Russia. He was an advisor to the Central Bank of Iceland before it crashed in 2008. During the Clinton administration, Orszag was an advisor to Rahm Emanuel and Bill Clinton on the disastrous NAFTA bill that has devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector. Oddly, Orszag's background has received virtually no attention in the media. He has a troubling background, which deserves to be looked at very carefully. Orszag, for example, should start by explaining exactly what happened to the Icelandic economy. Orszag was, after all, the founder and president of the economic consultancy firm which advised the Central Bank of Iceland - befor e it went bankrupt. How did Icelandic banks become so indebted? Ask Peter Orszag. Orszag is an economist who served six years in the Clinton administration (1993 - 98) under Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary who recently resigned from his"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com senior position at the woefully mismanaged and nearly bankrupt Citigroup. The fact that Orszag was a protégé of the now disgraced Rubin certainly does not bode well for the Obama administration. Rubin strongly opposed the regulation of derivatives when su ch regulation was proposed in 1997. Credit derivatives of mortgage - backed securities were the key reason for the recent failure of a number of large financial institutions, including AIG and Citigroup. In 1999, Rubin joined Citigroup as a board member and a participant \"in strategic managerial and operational matters of the company.\" The Wall Street Journal noted that Citigroup shareholders suffered losses of more than 70 percent since Rubin joined the firm and that he encouraged changes that led the firm to the brink of collapse. In December 2008, investors filed a lawsuit contending that Citigroup executives, including Rubin, sold shares at inflated prices while concealing the firm's risks. Orszag, a Jew, served on the president's Council of Economic Adv isers in 1993, under Rubin, when the Israeli Rahm Emanuel, Clinton's senior adviser, was pushing the disastrous NAFTA legislation through Congress. Prior to joining the Clinton team, Orszag was an economic adviser for the Russian Ministry of Finance in Mos cow from 1992 - 93. This was a period of rampant financial criminality during which many Russian mineral assets came under the control of the so - called Jewish oligarchs who became instant billionaires. Most of these oligarchs fled Russia when their crimes we re exposed and now live in Britain or Israel, where they obtained citizenship. Born in Boston on December 16, 1968, Orszag graduated from Princeton University in 1991. He then attended the London School of Economics, where he earned a degree in 1992 and w here he obtained his PhD in 1997. The London School of Economics was established by members of the Fabian Society, who believed in advancing socialism through gradual reforms. The Fabian Society is a British socialist movement, whose purpose is to advance the principles of social democracy via gradualist and reformist, rather than revolutionary means. The ideology of the Fabians is said to be described in the quote, \"Fabianism feeds on Capitalism, but excretes Communism.\" In 1998, after serving in the Cli nton administration, Orszag co - founded an economic consulting group company with his brother and Joseph Stiglitz called Sebago Associates, where he served as president through 2007. The firm's clients have included the World Bank, the Nordic Council of Min isters, and most notably, the Central Bank of Iceland. The once prosperous economy of Iceland has been devastated by the current economic crisis, which its citizens say was carried out by a gang of financial criminals who followed disastrous policies and a dvice - provided by Peter Orszag and Company.

Bush is not directly related to Isadore Bush, the Jewish wine merchant who headed the B'nai B'rith lodge in St. Louis in the late 1800s, he just as well ough t to be. As president, George W. Bush has done more to advance the agenda of the secretive Jewish brotherhood of Freemasons, the real Elders of Zion, than any other political leader in living memory. The proposed plan to use $700 billion taxpayer dollars t o bail out the Zionist gangsters of Wall Street is Bush's coup de grâce, the final thrust of the dagger of a treasonous president into the bleeding body politic. The Zionist plan to bail out A.I.G. and its criminal boss, Maurice R. Greenberg, with a government loan of $85 billion dollars should have all American taxpayers up in arms. This is, after all, taxpayer money they are stealing. The $700 billion bail - out is described by the New York Times as \"an ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street into the obligations of American taxpayers.\" Make no mistake about it, this is a massive transfer of American wealth to Zionist criminals - a huge \"rip - off\" in plain English. On Friday, Se ptember 26, 2008, President Bush scrambled to bring rebellious members of his own party behind a $700 billion dollar taxpayer bail - out of Wall St. banks amid bitter political recriminations from both Democrats and Republicans over collapsed negotiations, t he AP reported. Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, said many GOP lawmakers dislike the proposal that has been pushed on the administration's behalf principally by Henry Paulson. \"Basically, I believe the Paulson proposal is badly structured,\" he s aid. \"It does nothing basically for the stressed mortgage payer. It does a lot for three or four or five banks.\" USING FEAR TO SOFTEN RESISTANCE Like all dictators, President Bush employed fear and deception to accomplish his criminal agenda. His prime - t ime speech to the nation on Wednesday, September 24, is a classic example of how an un - elected president used fear to soften public resistance to the $700 billion bail - out of criminal enterprises like A.I.G. His speech was short on facts and long on fear. It should be noted that Bush is the same man who lied to the world about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and who recklessly started two illegal wars of aggression after 9 - 11, which he and his vice president Dick Cheney refused to investigate. The ke ystone to the Bush - Bernanke $700 billion bail - out is the $85 billion being made available to Maurice Greenberg's A.I.G. As I point out in this article, A.I.G. is a criminal operation, which engaged in illegal conduct for many years. American taxpayer mone y should never be used to support criminal operations like A.I.G. Here is the key paragraph from Bush's prime time televised speech, which was clearly meant to put fear in American hearts:"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com The government's top economic experts warn that without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic, and a distressing scenario would unfold: More banks could fail, including some in your community.

And if you own a business or a farm, you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit. More businesses would close their doors, and millions of Americans could lose the ir jobs. Even if you have good credit history, it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car or send your children to college. And ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession. A $700 billion expenditur e on distressed mortgage - related assets would be roughly what the country has spent in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon's total yearly budget appropriation. The bail - out would cost every man, woman and child in the United States more than $2,000 — before interest. Fed chairman Ben Shalom Bernanke held a series of conference calls with members of Congress to push the bail - out. No wonder hard - working Americans despise Jewish crooks like Maurice Greenberg and Ben Bernanke. I don't unde rstand why the public is not protesting and burning tires in the streets of American cities. It is certainly no secret that A.I.G. is a criminal operation; this is known to anyone who reads the newspapers. Doesn't anybody read the papers? Why are American s not massively protesting this proposed bail - out? To my mind, it can only be because the news coverage of the huge bail - out never mentions Greenberg's long history of criminal activity. The bail - out, now proposed at $700 billion, is portrayed as something that is necessary to save the economy of Main Street -- not a bail - out for Zionist criminals of the highest magnitude. \"IF WE WERE LEGAL, WE WOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS\" It should be noted that my accusations about Greenberg's criminality are well documente d, in the New York Times , for example.

For over a decade, A.I.G. engaged in a scheme to mischaracterize premiums paid on the workers' compensation line of insurance... In 1991, A.I.G.'s general counsel, newly arrived from a law firm, undertook a review of the practice... In his interviews, the general counsel learned about the cost that the company would have to incur to 'get legal.'

Mark Wood, an eyewitness, said: \"It looked like a mid - sized executive jet and the way it turned suggested it was being aimed deliberately at a target.\" THE RIP - OFF CONTINUES By April 2009, A.I.G. had received mo re than $180 billion in loans from the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs, the former employer of Hank Paulson, Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, was the largest single recipient of this money receiving nearly $13 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds. While A.I.G. ow ed this money to Goldman Sachs and other private investment banks, members of Congress and some voices in the media expressed outrage that taxpayer money was going to the banks. Had the corrupt and fraudulent A.I.G. been allowed to fail in a controlled ma nner through bankruptcy, bondholders and derivative counterparties (major banks) would have suffered significant losses, limiting the amount of taxpayer funds directly used. Ben Bernanke argued: \"If a federal agency had [appropriate authority] on September 16 [2008], they could have been used to put A.I.G. into conservatorship or receivership, unwind it slowly, protect policyholders, and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate. That outcome would have been far preferable to the situat ion we find ourselves in now.\" The \"situation\" Bernanke means is that the claims of bondholders and counterparties were paid in full - at 100 cents on the dollar - with taxpayer funds without giving taxpayers the rights to the future profits of these inst itutions. In other words, the benefits went to the banks while the taxpayers pay the costs. Joshua B. Bolten, former executive director of legal and governmental affairs at Goldman Sachs, became Chief of Staff for President George W. Bush in April 2006. B olten is credited with recruiting Henry Paulson, CEO of Goldman Sachs, to become Treasury Secretary in July 2006. Paulson crafted the A.I.G. bailout in which Goldman Sachs was the largest single recipient of this money ($12.9 billion). Paulson spoke with the CEO of Goldman Sachs at least dozen times during the week of the bailout, according to the New York Times .

On the other hand, there has been a great deal of discussion by the media about the alleged Islamic n etwork behind 9 - 11. The official - but unproven - version of events, which has been promoted without question by the media, is that Al Qaida, a non - state entity supposedly headed by Osama Bin Laden, with the support of some state actors, such as Afghanist an, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, planned and carried out the 9 - 11 terror attacks for some reason which has yet to be articulated by the perpetrators - or explained by the U.S. government."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Osama Bin Laden said he had nothing to do with 9 - 11.

The \"War on Terror\" is actually a long - planned Zionist war plan to dominate the Middle East first articulated by the right - wing Israeli politician Benjamin Netanyahu (Likud) in the mid - 1980s. This radical Zionist plan became U.S. policy in the aftermath of 9 - 11 and provided the excuse fo r at least four on - going wars and/or military occupations in the region: Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Pakistan. President Obama recently ordered some 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, whence the terrorists of 9 - 11 supposedly came, at least accor ding to the government's fabricated fairy tale about Bin Laden and the twenty hijackers.

The fundamental question remains: who really carried out 9 - 11? This is the key point where the official story diverges from the path of the evidence. It is also the basic question of culpability where \"truth seekers\" disagree. The U.S. government, which confiscated and destroyed tons of evidence, is actually holding the person alleged to be Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the \"master mind of 9 - 11,\" but refuses to put him on trial in the United States.

A.I.G., for example, a dodgy insurance company that has long engaged in criminal practices, has received more than $180 billion of U.S. tax - payer funds. As I pointed out in the chapter and articles about the bail - out, some of the key people behind the bail - out - Ben Shalom Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, for example - are themselves dedicated Zionists with histories of working with and for criminals.

SINGH: THE PTECH WHISTLEBLOWER Shortly after 9 - 11 a woman named Indira Singh came forward with claims that a Massachusetts - based e nterprise software company called Ptech had played a key role in the events of 9 - 11. In 2002, Singh was described in the Boston press as \"a former Ptech consultant.\" Indira Singh began her career at First Boston in the mid - 1970s when mortgage - based se curities were first developed by Laurence D. Fink, now CEO of BlackRock. Singh, said to be a risk architect and Information Technology (IT) professional with JP Morgan, certainly knew a great deal about Ptech and its dodgy spy software, which had reportedl y been loaded onto the most critical computer networks in the U.S. government prior to 9 - 11. A Boston Globe article from 7 December 2002 described Singh as \"a former Ptech consultant,\" citing an interview she had done with WBZ - TV: Singh said last night in an interview on WBZ that she told the FBI \"in no uncertain terms\" about the connection between Ptech and [Yasin al] Qadi. She said that weeks after talking to the Boston FBI, she was ̳'shocked\" and"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com \"frustrated\" to learn that the FBI still had not alerted any of the government agencies using Ptech software that there were questions about the company's ties to suspected terrorist fund - raisers. Indira Singh, the former Ptech consultant turned whistleblower, sought to put the blame on Arabs and the CIA. The essence of Singh's 9 - 11 presentation was that the people behind Ptech were Arab Moslems tied to Saudi financiers of terrorism and a rogue element within the CIA, which included Vice President Dick Cheney. Singh later did a series of interviews with Jamey A. Hecht, editor of From the Wilderness (FTW), a website that featured material written by Mike Ruppert. In these interviews Singh discussed Ptech's enterprise software, how it could have been used to manipulate data on critical government computer networ ks such as the FAA, NORAD, and U.S. Air Force, and who she thought was behind the company: Hecht: You said at the 9 - 11 Citizens' Commission hearings, you mentioned - its on page 139 of transcript - that Ptech was with Mitre Corporation in the basement of the FAA for two years prior to 9 - 11 and their specific job was to look at interoperability issues the FAA had with NORAD and the Air Force, in case of an emergency. Singh: Yes, I have a good diagram for that... Jamey Hecht: And that relationship had been going on mediated by Ptech for two years prior to 9 - 11. You elsewhere say that the Secret Service is among the government entities that had a contract with Ptech. Mike Ruppert's thesis in Crossing the Rubicon , as you know, is that the software that was ru nning information between FAA and NORAD was superseded by a parallel subsuming version of itself that was being run by the Secret Service on state of the art parallel equipment in the PEOC with a nucleus of Secret Service personnel around Cheney. Singh cl aimed that Ptech was connected to the CIA and Saudi millionaires, using terminology like \"blowback,\" a term that is not commonly used: \"Ptech had all the markings,\" said Indira Singh. All the markings of a CIA front company. \"I think there is a CIA withi n the CIA,\" Indira told FTW. \"I think there is a Shadow CIA that does the Iran - Contra type of things — they get funding from illicit methods – and that the Saudis are in on it. They might have trained some operatives, and later it backfired - it was blowback within blowback, perhaps.\" In one of the FTW articles about Ptech by Michael Kane, a list of three suspect groups is presented: the Muslim Brotherhood, Christian Cultists, and Nazis. Kane describes Ptech as \"the Alpha dog\" in a relationship with Mitre, but the ownership of Mitre is never discussed. Elsewhere, Vice President Dick Cheney is named as a suspect, depicted as the mastermind single - handedly running the whole show:"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Ptech was working with Mitre Corp. in the FAA and, according to Indira, Ptech was the Alpha dog in that relationship.

Mitre knew the FAA's technolog ical enterprise inside and out, including any simulation - and - testing (war game) technology operated by the FAA. This was the perfect marriage to ensure that the capacity to covertly intervene in FAA operations on 9/11 existed - in the middle of simulated war games. It is also the perfect marriage to ensure that the command and control of these capabilities was readily available to Dick Cheney via Secret Service Ptech software in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, the bunker to which Cheney was \" rushed\" by the Secret Service. As already pointed out in Part 1 of this series, Ptech does what Total Information Awareness (TIA, the DARPA program to monitor all electronic transactions in real - time) is supposed to do. There are an undetermined number of other software programs in the hands of an undetermined number of corporations also capable of this.

Like the Twin Towers, both Lehman and A.I.G. were Zionist - controlled organizations. The systems of corporate financial security, enforcem ent, and investigation were also under Zionist control. Despite repeated warnings, indictments, and violations of the law by A.I.G., the heads of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank called for the U.S. taxpayer to bail - out these corrupt and criminal enterprises. The key player in this huge and historic bail - out was Ben Shalom Bernanke, a dedicated Zionist who spent summers working for a well - known Jewish criminal who controlled elections in Dillon, South Carolina."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Maurice Greenberg, the disgraced head of the criminal A.I.G. and chairman and CEO of C.V.

The fact that the first plane that hit the World Trade Center flew directly into the secure computer room of Marsh, a company run by Maurice Greenberg's son Jeffrey, is just one of the most obvious connections between these two catastrophic events. Ptech's dodgy enterprise software is another. The first plane nosed right into the secure computer room of Marsh, a Greenberg - run company. The unusual bursts of white smoke and light orange flame that accompanied the explosions came from the Marsh comp uter room on the north and east sides of the tower and suggest that the room had been loaded with Thermate and equipped with a homing device that guided the plane into the tower. In the first part of this chapter, the key role of Ptech enterprise software in 9 - 11 was discussed. The person who first brought public awareness to the Ptech problem is a \"risk architect\" named Indira R. Singh, who lived near the World Trade Center and was working with JP Morgan Chase on 9 - 11. Singh is very knowledgeable about Pt ech and what such enterprise software can do in situations like 9 - 11 -- and the financial crisis that gripped Wall Street in September 2008. My research found that one of the key people involved in the founding of Ptech was a Jewish lawyer from Worcester, Massachusetts, named Michael S. Goff. Goff's father and grandfather had both been highest level Freemasons in the Zionist secret society of B'nai B'rith. Michael was Ptech's first marketing manager and all - around general director in 1994, according to his own published statements about his role with the company. He was responsible for all hiring, training, and procurement for the company."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Goff went on to work for Guardium, an Israeli enterprise software company founded and headed by individuals from Israe li military intelligence. As I explain in \"The Architecture of Terror: Mapping the Israeli Network Behind 9 - 11,\" one of the founders and directors of Guardium is Gill Zaphrir (a.k.a. Zafrir), an Israeli colonel who \"headed the research and development depa rtment of the Israel Air Force.\" Goff was working for Zaphrir's Guardium in 2005 when I discovered his role in founding Ptech. Col. Gill Zaphrir headed the R&D Department of the Israel Air Force. Singh doesn't say anything about Goff at Ptech, but that is understandable. This Israeli connection is something I discovered in 2005 and it has not been discussed in any of the mainstream media. It is unlikely that anybody else would have told Singh about Goff's key role in building Ptech in the mid - 1990s. Furt hermore, Israelis are generally seen as allies of the United States. Understanding the role of Ptech's dodgy enterprise software and the connection between Ptech and Israeli military intelligence requires reading my articles about Ptech and Mitre. With th is Israeli conection to Ptech in mind, I recommend reading \"The Story of Indira Singh\" from an interview she did in April 2005. This is one of the most informative and least biased interviews she has done. It's rather long, but well worth reading for anyon e interested in understanding 9 - 11 and the financial crisis. This interview also has extremely interesting testimony about the downing of Flight 93 and extremely mysterious demolition of the forty - seven - story WTC 7, which was the third tower owned by Larry Silverstein. Singh's comments about Ptech and her work at JP Morgan shed a great deal of light on how this Ptech enterprise software may have played a role in both 9 - 11 and the financial meltdown. I recommend reading the entire interview. To give an idea of what Singh discusses, I have provided some of the most interesting extracts below. Extracts from \"The Story of Indira Singh\" from Our World in Balance, April 27, 2005:"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Indira Singh has been working on Wall Street since 1975. On 9 - 11 she was working a s a senior consultant for JP Morgan Chase. She was tasked with developing a next - generation, operational, risk - blueprint. Which would proactively identify exposures, including money laundering, rogue trading, and illicit financing patterns. It was in this capacity nine months later, [that] she became aware of the biggest threat to our country, a trans - nationally protected terrorist cartel that brought us 9 - 11. Indira Singh is a private pilot and a climber. Prior to 9 - 11, she volunteered as a civilian emerge ncy medical technician, until she was injured at ground zero. They [the Twin Towers] were mysterious international structures that were the center and the heart of our Western Civilization, basically. - Indira Singh Singh: September 11th I was a senior consultant for JP Morgan Chase and Risk. I had cycled through several of their Risk areas as an enterprise architect, or an information architect, technology architect... which basically means that you take a look at the entire enterprise and come up with a blueprint, make sure that all the systems, not just one system, but all the systems, the blueprints for all the systems that are developed to support the business, are in - line, in tune with the business goals and the business architecture and the business processes and where the business is going. So it‘s pretty high - level, we call it the CXO level, or the Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer levels and there are disciplines and methodologies and very esoteric software that‘s used to manage t his. I did that at JP Morgan Chase and I also worked for a small company in Washington, D.C. that was doing some very innovative work regarding technology interoperability, they were developing some inference engines to think about how to put technology ar chitectures together and I wanted to use that for my risk work, basically. ...we were seeking funding from In - Q - Tel, which was the CIA‘s information technology seeking arm, I had been spending pretty much every Friday, Thursday - Friday down in D.C. trying to get that project off the ground, and trying to get it funded ... Singh: P - Tech is the one thread, the one golden thread you pull on, and all of this is unraveled. Because it goes into the corporations, it goes into these government entities, it goes into the terrorism financing entities... none of which have been taken to task... there are just so many questions about what does this all mean? And as I investigated further, we found that the origins of P - Tech were very interesting. Where did this company come f rom? Obviously, that is the first question. And how did they get to be so powerful? Who were the people, who were the organizations that brought them in who knew, who gave them the power? ...

Who benefits? ... Singh: The FBI. In fact, this has to be made very clear, there are some extraordinarily real patriotic Americans, and good people in the FBI, as has been said by Colleen Rowley, one of the FBI whistleblowers, there‘s a wall in the FBI. And this has been validated to me by various in Houston who are very close to the power bases and are pretty ticked off at what‘s happening in this country and are speaking out. As are many CIA agents who are very concerned that it has gone too far, as are many NSA agents who are concerned that it has gone too far, and FBI agents. So we have a lot of people who are speaking out, they have kept quiet too long, they‘re afraid, they are afraid of what‘s happening to this country ... Singh: Ari Fleischer spun it to find sugar that day. He said, ̳There‘s nothing wrong. Nothing to see here, everything‘s fine.‘ So they did a token raid and that was basically it. But everything that I have d one since that time has been for one reason and one reason only, that there may come a time, that people will find the trail to P - Tech, and it won‘t be hidden or buried, I‘ve kept it alive, whether they‘ve renamed their company and moved on I want to keep the names, the details, everything alive, no matter what I have to do, so that, should there come a time for justice and accounting for 9 - 11, and for what‘s happening in the world today, it makes it easier for other people to unravel the truth... Whatever yo u‘re political inclinations, this is wrong. This is criminal, this is murder, this is worldwide atrocity. And I have reached some very good people on the left and on the right, who are willing to speak out about P - Tech. ... Singh: It was possible that ther e was an alternate command and control system. Could you technically use P - Tech software to do the surveillance and intervention? Well, gosh, yes, that‘s exactly what I was planning on using it for in one of the largest banks in the world. ...

P - Tech worked with the FAA for several years, didn‘t they?"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com Singh: It was a joint project between P - Tech and Mitre, and they were looking at holes, basically in the FA A‘s interoperability, responding with other agencies, law enforcement, in the case of an emergency such as hijacking.

Now, if anyone was in a position to know where the holes were, P - Tech was. And that‘s exactly the point. If anybody was in a position to write software to take advantage of those holes, it would have been P - Tech. ... Singh: Now, with the FAA in particular, if something goes wrong, and there is an emergency with a particular flight, and the DOD needs to be notified, well that‘s a really major interoperability thing, a signal has to be sent in some way, shape or form, either mediated by a human in most cases, or automatically, or even if its mediated by a human something needs to be initiated on a separate computer to start a whole other sequence of events, interventions, scrambling a jet, notification up and downstream with many other organizati ons, such as NORAD, such as other terminal radar areas, such as local law enforcement, you name it. So, this all has to be blueprinted, mapped out, and that‘s where Enterprise Architecture comes in, you need some kind of blueprint to keep all of this toget her and that‘s what P - Tech was so good at. Question: Now was there a reference to P - Tech having operated in the basement, out of the FAA? Singh: Yes. Now, typically, because the scope of such projects are so overarching and so wide - ranging, when you are doing an enterprise architecture project, you pretty much have access to how anything in the organization is being done, where it‘s being done, on what systems, what the information is, and you pretty much have carte blanche. Now if it‘s a major project th at spans several years, the team that comes in has literally access to almost anything they want because you‘re operating on a blueprint level, on a massive scale. So, yes, they were everywhere, and I was told that they were in places that required clearan ces, I was told they had log - on access to FAA flight control computers, I was told that they had passwords to many computers that you may not on the surface... let‘s say you... isolated part of a notification process that was mediated by a computer, and you wa nted to investigate it further, then you typically get log - on access to that computer, and from that back upstream or downstream, so, who knows? In my experience, I could have access to almost anything I wanted to in JP Morgan Chase... and didn‘t, for the re ason if anything went wrong, I didn‘t wanna have the access.

I don‘t think these people were stupid, I think they were deliberately c onfused, if anything. Q. Well we know very well that there was a simulation of the very event taking place during the event. Singh: And I believe there is proof there was more than one. Just in case the first one didn‘t confuse people enough. So what doe s this say? I can be very objective about this and say, ―Well, the terrorists knew that there were war games scheduled for this day and they took advantage of it and called 9 - 11 a particular day, however, we do know that 9 - 11 had been selected prior... ok, s o maybe the war games were set many weeks prior for 9 - 11...‖ and you can play this game over and over and over.

A twenty - five - page scientific paper entitled \"Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9 - 11 World Trade Center Catastrophe\" presents physical evidence that an extremely powerful form of super - thermite was used to demolish the twin towers. The research paper written by nine scientists, including Dr. Steven E. Jones of Brigham Young University, analyzes red - gray chips of a highly - explosive thermitic material, \"characterized as nano - thermite or super - thermite,\" found in five dust samples from the collapsed towers. The paper was published in the Open Chemical Physics Journal and marks a historic breakthrough i n the scientific investigation of the explosive collapses of the Twin Towers, although it has not been covered by the media outside of Salt Lake City. If we had a truly free press in the United States this discovery would be front page news and a subject o f discussion on every news outlet in the nation. Super - thermite is a highly energetic form of thermite (iron oxide and aluminum) in which at least one component is in the extremely fine or nano - size range with particles 100 nanometers (1 nm = 1 billionth of a meter) or smaller, often along with silicon and carbon. Super - thermite is an extremely powerful explosive that releases much more energy per gram than any other conventional explosive used in demolition.

These chips released between 50 to nearly 100 percent more energy that the four conventional explosives. One of the chips released twice as much energy per gram than Xerogel, a similar super - thermite nanocomposite, and the chips all ignited at 430 degrees C., 100 degrees lower than the ignition temperature for Xerogel.

For the criminals of 9 - 11 and their supporters, the writing on the wall is now clear. It says, \"Game Over!\" The discovery of this active thermitic material is critical to understanding what really happened on 9 - 11. This scientific discovery reveals t hat sophisticated demolition explosives had been applied to the interiors of the Twin Towers long before the two planes struck them on 9 - 11. Although we already had evidence that the towers were demolished with thermitic explosives, this is the first time we have pieces of the actual explosives involved in the demolition of the Twin Towers. This crucial discovery is not front - page news in the United States only because our \"free press\" is actually very tightly controlled. But the truth cannot be so easil y controlled. Americans now live in an uncomfortable and conflicted state in which provable scientific evidence tells us that our leaders are complicit in a criminal cover - up of the truth of what really happened on 9 - 11. This is the state I have been in since September 2001. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was all grins during a community meeting in Los Angeles on May 15, 2009 until two 9 - 11 truth activists asked him about the evidence of super - thermite in the dust of the World Trade Center. Presented w ith the paper by Steven E. Jones and eight other scientists Biden gave a terse one - word response and retreated to his security cordon. The truth of 9 - 11, however, will not be as easy to avoid. The evidence that Jones and his team examined was in the form of very small particles found in five different samples of WTC dust. In each sample they found small chips that were composed of two layers, a red layer and a gray layer. The gray layer consisted mostly of iron oxide, while the red layer contained iron, oxygen, aluminum, silicon, and carbon -- all the components of super - thermite. The analysis and testing of the red and gray chips revealed that the super - thermite composite ignited at the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com surprisingly low temperature of 430 degrees Celsius and caused an e xplosive reaction which resulted in iron spheroids, exactly like thermite. In other words, the heat - producing explosive reaction created temperatures hotter than 1400 degrees Celsius, the melting point of iron. The U.S.G.S. survey of the dust found lar ge amounts of iron - rich spheres that were evidence that molten iron had accompanied the destruction of the World Trade Center. Nothing in the government version of the collapse of the Twin Towers explains the large amounts of molten iron found in the rubb le. Thermite does. The Jones paper concludes: The small size of the iron oxide particles qualifies the material to be characterized as nanothermite or super - thermite...Based on these observations, we conclude that the red layer of the red/gray chips we h ave discovered in the WTC dust is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporating nanotechnology, and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material. HOW DID SUPER - THERMITE GET INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER? Super - thermite, which has been fabricated at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other places, can be sprayed or even ―painted‖ onto surfaces, effectively forming an energetic or even explosive paint, the study pointed out. ―The sol - gel process is very amenable to dip - , spin - , and spray - coating technologies to coat surfaces,\" scientists from Lawrence Livermore wrote in a 2002 paper entitled \"Energetic nanocomposites with sol - gel chemistry: Synthesis, safety, and characterization.\" \"The red chips we found in the WTC dust confo rm to their description of 'thin films' of 'hybrid inorganic/organic energetic nanocomposite',\" the Jones paper says. \"Indeed, the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com descriptive terms 'energetic coating' and 'nice adherent film' fit very well with our observations of the red - chips which sur vived the WTC destruction.\" The published documentation of evidence of super - thermite in the dust of the World Trade Center has taken the 9 - 11 truth movement to a new level. If Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaida did not spray super - thermite in the Twin Towers, who did? It is now evident that a solution of super - thermite had been applied to large sections of the World Trade Center, including walls, floor sections, structural beams, and columns in the core section. It may have been applied as a thin spray coati ng applied to the undersides of the floor pans under the guise of fire - proofing, asbestos abatement, or some other form of building maintenance. Super - thermite is safe to handle and only becomes dangerous when it is dry. We need to find out who manufact ured this nano - composite thermite and who applied the bi - layered film of super explosive to the interior surfaces of the buildings. This certainly must have been a task that involved a team of men working for weeks, if not months, and their presence must have been observed by security and other personnel involved in maintaining the buildings. Finding the source of the super - thermite and identifying the people who applied it to the Twin Towers will reveal the true culprits of 9 - 11. Several years ago, I co ntacted Burton Fried, president of LVI Services, Inc., a demolition company that reportedly had done extensive \"asbestos abatement\" work in the twin towers. I considered LVI's work in the twin towers as suspicious because the company is primarily known fo r asbestos abatement and preparing structures for demolition. LVI has done millions of dollars of research and development for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2000, for example, FedSpending.org shows that LVI Group, Inc. received $3.246 million worth of contracts with the U.S. Army, of which $2.967 million was for \"Applied Research and Exploratory Development.\" It should be noted that the military is the main user and developer of super - thermite. Burton Fried of LVI"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" Bollyn.com LVI has also worked closely with Controlled Demolition Inc. on large demolition projects. LVI's role in these projects is reportedly preparing the structure for demolition prior to the placement of charges. LVI advertises that it sets up \"turn key\" demol ition projects. Is this the kind of work LVI did at the World Trade Center? Although Mr. Fried denied having done the extensive \"asbestos abatement\" work in the towers as reported in Engineering News - Record on September 13, 2001, Debra Rubin, one of the journalists who wrote the piece, confirmed that the source of this information had been LVI. Fried's quick reaction, \"I didn't do it,\" only increased my suspicions. What happens from this point on depends a great deal on what the people do with the infor mation about what really destroyed the towers on 9 - 11: The three buildings that collapsed were not brought down by the fires caused by the burning fuel of two airliners; they were demolished with pre - planted explosives, including large amounts of an extre mely potent form of super - thermite, which had been applied to surfaces of the building in the months prior to 9 - 11. Osama Bin Laden and his gang of twenty certainly did not spray super - thermite throughout the towers of World Trade Center in the weeks and months before 9 - 11 – so who did? What we have to do as concerned citizens with moral courage seeking the truth of what really happened on 9 - 11 is to spread this information to our local news media and ask them to publish the information about this crucial discovery. We also have to bring this discovery to the attention of our local politicians, representatives, and senators in the U.S. Congress. We the people have to use our power to force this issue to be discussed in the media and the halls of power. It is time for us to stand up against those who have hijacked the truth about 9 - 11.
