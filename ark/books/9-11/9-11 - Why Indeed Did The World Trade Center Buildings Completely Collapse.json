I consider the o fficial FEMA, NIST, and 9-11 Commission reports that fires plus impact damage al one caused complete collapses of all three buildings. And I present evidence for the co ntrolled-demolition hypothesis, which is suggested by the available data, and can be tested scientifically, and yet has not been analyzed in any of the reports funded by the US gov ernment. Introduction We start with the fact that large quantities of mol ten metal were observed in basement areas under rubble piles of all three buil dings: the Twin Towers and WTC7. A video clip provides eye-witness evidence regarding this metal at ground zero: http://plaguepuppy.net/public_html/video%20archive/ red_hot_ground_zero_low_quality. wmv . The photographs below by Frank Silecchia show c hunks of the hot metal being removed from the North Tower rubble on September 27 , 2001 (according to photographer's aid). Notice the color of the lower portion of the extracted metal -- this tells us much about the temperature of the metal and prov ides important clues regarding its composition, as we shall see.

"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 5 September 2006/Volume 3 Thirteen Reasons to Challenge Government-sponsored Reports and to Investigate the Controlled-demolitio n Hypothesis 1. Molten Metal: Flowing and in Pools There are several published observations of molten metal in the basements of all three buildings, WTC 1, 2 (“Twin Towers”) and 7. For exa mple, Dr. Keith Eaton toured Ground Zero and stated in The Structural Engineer , ‘They showed us many fascinating slides’ [Eaton] co ntinued, ‘ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plate s sheared and bent in the disaster’. ( Structural Engineer , September 3, 2002, p. 6; emphasis added.) The existence of molten metal at Ground Zero was re ported by several observers (see first photograph above), including Greg Fuchek: For six months after Sept. 11, the grou nd temperature varied between 600 degrees Fahrenheit and 1,500 degrees, sometimes higher. “ In the first few weeks, sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wrec kage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel,” Fuchek said. (Walsh, 2002) Sarah Atlas was part of New Jersey's Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue and was one of the first on the scene at Ground Zero wi th her canine partner Anna. She reported in Penn Arts and Sciences , summer 2002, ‘Nobody's going to be alive.' Fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet. (Penn, 2002; emph asis added.) Notice that the molten metal (probably not steel al one; see discussion below) was flowing down in the rubble pile early on; so it is not the case that the molten metal pools formed due to subterranean fires after the collapses. A video clip provides further eyewitnes s evidence regarding this extremely hot metal at ground zero: http://plaguepuppy.net/public_html/video%20archive/ red_hot_ground_zero_low_quality.wmv . The observer notes that the observed surface of thi s metal is still reddish-orange some six weeks after 9-11. This implies a large quantity of a met al with fairly low heat conductivity and a relatively large heat capacity (e.g., iron is more likely than aluminum) even in an underground location. Like magma in a volcanic cone, such meta l might remain hot and molten for a long time -- once the metal is sufficiently hot to melt in large quantities and then kept in a fairly-well insulated underground location. Moreover, as hypot hesized below, thermite reactions may well have resulted in substantial quantities (observed i n pools) of molten iron at very high temperatures – initially above 2,000 °C (3,632 °F). At these temperatures, various materials entrained in the molten metal pools will continue t o undergo exothermic reactions which would tend to keep the pools hot for weeks despite radiat ive and conductive losses. Any thermite cutter charges which did not ignite during the collapse wo uld also contribute to the prolonged heating. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 6 September 2006/Volume 3 Thus, molten metal was repeatedly observed and form ally reported in the rubble piles of the WTC Towers and WTC 7, metal that looked like mo lten steel or perhaps iron. Scientific analysis would be needed to conclusively ascertain the composition of the molten metal in detail. I maintain that these observations are consistent w ith the use of high-temperature cutter- charges such as thermite, HMX or RDX or some combin ation thereof, routinely used to melt/cut/demolish steel. [See Grimmer, 2004] Therm ite is a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum powder. The end products of the thermite reaction are aluminum oxide and molten iron . So the thermite reaction generates molten iron directly, a nd is hot enough to melt and even evaporate steel which it contacts while reacting. Here is th e thermite-reaction equation for a typical mixture of aluminum powder iron oxide powder:  2Al + Fe 2 O 3 = Al 2 O 3 + 2Fe (molten iron), ∆ H = − 853.5 kJ/mole. Thermite contains its own supply of oxygen and so the reaction cannot be smothered, even with water. Use of sulfur in conjunction with the thermite, for example in thermate, will accelerate the destructive effect on steel, and sul fidation of structural steel was indeed observed in some of the few recovered members from the WTC r ubble, as reported in Appendix C of the FEMA report. (FEMA, 2002; see also, http://www.911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/metall urgy/index.html .) On the other hand, falling buildings (absent incendiaries such as ther mite) have insufficient directed energy to result in melting of large quantities of metal; any partic les of molten metal somehow formed during collapse will not coalesce into molten pools of met al! The government reports admit that the building fire s were insufficient to melt steel beams -- then where did the molten metal pools come from? Metals expert Dr. Frank Gayle (working with NIST) stated: Your gut reaction would be the jet fuel is what mad e the fire so very intense, a lot of people figured that's what melted the steel. Indeed it did not, the steel did not melt . (Field, 2005; emphasis added.) And in an a fact sheet released in August, 2006, NI ST states: “In no instance did NIST report that steel in the WTC towers melted due to the fire s.\" http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm None of the official reports tackles the my stery of the molten metal pools. Yet this is clearl y a significant clue to what caused the Towers and WT C 7 to collapse. So an analysis of the composition of the previously-molten metal is requi red by a qualified scientific panel. This could well become an experiment crucis. Prof. Thomas Eagar explained in 2001 that the WTC f ires would NOT melt steel: \"The fire is the most misunderstood part of the W TC collapse. Even today, the media report (and many scientists believe) that the steel melted. It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot, especially with so much fuel presen t. This is not true.... The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel . In combustion science, there are three basic types of flames, namely, a jet burner, a pre- mixed flame, and a diffuse flame.... In a diffuse flame, the fuel and the oxidant are not mixed before ignition, but flow together in an unco ntrolled manner and combust when the fuel/oxidant ratios reach values within the fla mmable range. A fireplace is a diffuse flame burning in air, as was the WTC fire. Diffuse flames generate the lowest heat"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 7 September 2006/Volume 3 intensities of the three flame types... The maximu m flame temperature increase for burning hydrocarbons (jet fuel) in air is, thus, ab out 1000 °C -- hardly sufficient to melt steel at 1500 °C.\" \"But it is very difficult to reach [even] this maximum temperature with a diffuse flame. There is nothing to ensure that the fuel and air in a diffuse flame are mixed in the best ratio... This is why the temperatures in a re sidential fire are usually in the 500 °C to 650 °C range [Cote, 1992]. It is known that the WTC fire was a fuel-rich, diff use flame as evidenced by the copious black smoke. ... It is known that structural steel begins to soften around 425 °C and loses about half of its strength at 650 °C [Cote, 1992]. This is why steel is stress relieved in thi s temperature range. But even a 50% loss of strength is still insufficient, by itself, to ex plain the WTC collapse... The WTC, on this low-wind day, was likely not stressed more than a t hird of the design allowable... Even with its strength halved, the steel could still sup port two to three times the stresses imposed by a 650 °C fire .\" (Eagar and Musso, 2001; emphasis added.) We will return to the question of fire-induced stre sses and WTC collapses later. Even without a direct elemental ana lysis, we can rule out some metals based on available data. The photograph in the introduction shows a chunk of hot metal being extracted at ground zero. The hottest portion of the chunk is t he lower portion, which was deepest down in the slag, and the metal is seen to be yellow-hot, c ertainly above cherry-red hot. The following table (see http://www.processassociates.com/process/heat/metco lor.htm ) provides data regarding the melting temperatures of lead, aluminum, structu ral steel and iron, along with approximate metal temperatures by color. Note that the approxi mate temperature of a hot metal is given by its color, quite independent of the composition of the metal. (A notable exception is falling liquid aluminum, which due to low emissivity and high refl ectivity appears silvery-gray in daylight conditions, after falling through air 1-2 meters, r egardless of the temperature at which the poured-out aluminum left the vessel. Aluminum does incandesce (glow) like other metals, but faintly, so that with the conditions described in t he previous sentence (which prevailed at the WTC on 9/11), falling liquid aluminum will appear s ilvery-gray. Rapid oxidation of the hot flowing aluminum will contribute to the observed ap pearance.

The temperature is well above the melting temperatures of lead, zinc a nd aluminum, and these metals can evidently be ruled out since they would be runny liquids at m uch lower (cherry-red or below) temperatures. However, the observed hot specimen c ould be structural steel (from the building) or iron (from a thermite reaction) or a combination of the two. Additional photographs of the hot metal could provide further information and advance the research. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 9 September 2006/Volume 3 The following photograph has become available, evid ently showing the now-solidified metal with entrained material, stored (as of November 200 5) in a warehouse in New York:   The abundance of iron (as opposed to aluminum) in t his material is indicated by the reddish rust observed. When a sample is obtained, a range of ch aracterization techniques will quickly give us information we seek. X-ray energy dispersive spect rometry (XEDS) will yield the elemental composition, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy will tell us the elements found in very small amounts that were undetectable with XEDS. Electron -backscattered diffraction in the scanning electron microscope will give us phase information; the formation of certain precipitates can tell us a minimum temperature the melt must have reached . We will endeavor to obtain and publish these data, whatever they reveal. An intriguing photograph found as Figur e 9-44 in the NIST report provides evidence for a highly exothermic reaction at the corner of the S outh Tower just minutes before its collapse.

I assert that this glowing liquid metal is consistent with flowing liquid iron from a nearby t hermite reaction zone, the \"bright spot\" in the NIST photo.

Who can deny that liquid, molten metal exist ed at the WTC disaster? The yellow color implies a molten-metal temperature of approximately 1000 o C, evidently above that which the dark-smoke hydrocarbon fires in the Towers could pr oduce. If aluminum (e.g., from the plane) had melted, it would melt and flow away from the he at source at its melting point of about 650 o C and thus would not reach the yellow color observe d for this molten metal. Thus, molten aluminum is already ruled out with high probability . But molten iron with the characteristics seen in this video is in fact consistent with a the rmite-reaction attacking the steel columns in the Tower, thus weakening the building just prior to it s collapse, since thermite produces molten iron at yellow-to-white hot temperatures. (As some of th e molten metal hits the side of the building in the video clip above, the white-hot interior is evi dently exposed as the metal \"splashes\".) Also, the fact that the liquid metal retains an orange hu e as it nears the ground (right photograph) further rules out aluminum, and suggests a mid-flig ht thermite reaction (typical of thermite)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 13 September 2006/Volume 3 Here are two independent videos of the yellow-white liquid metal pouring out of the South Tower: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=- 2991254740145858863&q=cameraplanet+9%2F11 and http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8564772103 237441151&q=cameraplanet+9%2F11 . A third and independent video of the yellow-hot fa lling liquid metal has recently been obtained by the Loose Change team and will be publicly avail able soon. [\"Final Cut;\" Dylan Avery, private communication.] The absence of dark smoke trailing behi nd the falling liquid material indicated it was not fuel-soaked debris. Indeed, white ash is seen in t hese videos trailing away from the falling liquid material. Falling molten steel would not produce such a white ash, whereas thermites produce a white aluminum-oxide ash which indeed trails away f rom the falling molten metal generated in the reaction, corresponding to the observations. We are studying residues found in soli dified slag as well as in dust from the WTC collapses, in order to determine the nature of the reactions which produced this molten material. We have performed electron-microprobe, X-ray Fluore scence and other analyses on samples of the solidified slag and on the WTC dust. The prove nience of the WTC dust sample is an apartment at 113 Cedar Street in New York City, NY. A memorial constructed from structural steel from the WTC Towers located at Clarkson Unive rsity in Potsdam, New York, is the source of previously-molten metal samples. Porous, solidi fied splatter found with the compacted dirt from this memorial is being analyzed. Results fro m these studies were presented at the 2006 meeting of the Utah Academy of Science followed by the American Scholars Symposium (Los Angeles), and are made available here: http://www.journalof911studies.com/JonesAnswersQues tionsWorldTradeCenter.pdf . Further strong evidences for the use of aluminothermics con tinue to be discovered in our analyses and will be reported in a separate paper. Other explanations for the observations are sought, of course. For example, F. Greening has suggested that aluminum from the planes which s truck the Towers could melt, and that this aluminum might fall on \"rusted steel surfaces induc ing violent thermite explosions . \" [Greening, 2006] So a few students and I did straightforward experiments by melting aluminum and dropping molten aluminum on pre-heated rusted steel surfaces. There were in fact no \"violent thermite\" reactions seen. We observed that the tem perature of the molten aluminum in contact with the rusty iron simply cooled at about 25 o C per minute (measured with an infrared probe) until the aluminum solidified, so that any thermite reactions between the aluminum and iron oxide must have been minimal and did not compete wi th radiative and conductive cooling, thus NOT supporting predictions made by Greening. There was no observable damage or even warping of the steel. (See photograph below.) Nor were violent reactions observed when we dropped molten aluminum onto crushed gypsum and con crete (wet or dry) and rusty steel. [Jones, 2006; available at http://www.scholarsfor911truth.org/ExptAlMelt.doc ] These experiments lend no support whatever to the notion [see Greening, 2006] that molten aluminum in the WTC Towers could have destroyed the enormous steel columns in the cores of the buildings, even if those columns were rusty and som ehow subjected to direct contact with liquid aluminum. F. Greening’s latest hypothesis (anothe r try) is this: oxygen tanks from planes somehow survived the plane crashes and the fireballs, yet l eaked about an hour later to release the oxygen in the tanks. This relatively small amount of oxyg en was somehow enough, he suggests, to burn office materials such as to melt the structural ste el in the building, to produce the large metal"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 14 September 2006/Volume 3 flow seen at yellow-hot temperature, flowing from W TC2. [Greening, 2006] Note that the latest proposed explanation provides no mechanism for feed ing fuel (office materials) into the oxygen stream, i.e., this is not like an oxy-acetylene tor ch. Moreover, even if the tanks survived the plane crashes, to melt steel would require steel (n ot air) temperatures of over 2,700 degrees F – while the steel structure is wicking the heat away from the heat source. Greening needs to consider heat transport in the steel as well as the probability that oxygen tanks in the planes could survive the destructive crashes of the planes . Finally, no plane hit WTC 7, so this latest hypothesis fails from the outset in this case. But we do consider alternative hypotheses such as these. Finally, the data from the solidified slag are not consistent with molten structural steel since it contains almost no chromium, yet shows sig nificant fluorine and elemental sulfur, and high concentrations of nickel and zinc. These resu lts will be the subject of a separate paper. A brief discussion of recent results, presented at th e Utah Academy of Sciences and subsequent colloquia is available here: http://www.journalof911studies.com/JonesAnswersQues tionsWorldTradeCenter.pdf , and here: http://worldtradecentertruth.com/volume/200609/DrJo nesTalksatISUPhysicsDepartment.pdf . We also noted that while a steel pan ho lding the aluminum glowed red and then yellow hot, when poured out the falling aluminum displayed a silvery-gray color, adding significantly to the evidence that the yellow-white molten metal flo wing out from the South Tower shortly before its collapse was NOT molten aluminum. (Reca ll also that the yellow color of the molten metal (video clip above) implies a temperature of a pproximately 1100 o C -- too high for the dark- smoke hydrocarbon fires burning in the building.) This is a point worth emphasizing: aluminum has low emissivity and high reflectivity, so that in daylight conditions after falling through air 1-2 meters, molten aluminum will appear silvery-gray, while molten iron (with its characteristic high emissivity) will appear yellow- white (at ~1100 o C) as observed in the molten metal dripping from the South Tower just before its collapse (see: http://www.supportthetruth.com/jones.php ). We also recall that this molten metal, after f alling approximately 150 meters (or yards) still retained a reddish orange color (photograph above). This is not the behavior of falling, molten aluminu m. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 15 September 2006/Volume 3 Molten aluminum poured onto rusted stee l: silvery flow, and no violent reactions observed at all (contrary to predictions by some of a vigorous aluminum-rust “thermitic reaction”). Same result -- when the rusty steel pi ece was pre-heated with the torch. In a fact sheet posted in August, 2006, NIST provides a possible explanation regarding this flowing liquid material: \"NIST concluded that the source of the molten mater ial was aluminum alloys from the aircraft, since these are known to melt be tween 475 degrees Celsius and 640 degrees Celsius (depending on the particula r alloy), well below the expected temperatures (about 1,000 degrees Celsius) in the vicinity of the fires. Aluminum is not expected to ignite at normal fire t emperatures and there is no visual indication that the material flowing from the tower was burning. \"Pure liquid aluminum would be expected to appear s ilvery. However, the molten metal was very likely mixed with large amoun ts of hot, partially burned, solid organic materials (e.g., furniture, c arpets, partitions and computers) which can display an orange glow, much like logs burning in a fireplace . The apparent color also would have been affected by slag formation on the surface.\" http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 16 September 2006/Volume 3 NIST states the hypothesis that flowing aluminum wi th partially burned organic materials mixed in, \"can display an orange glow.\" But will it reall y do this? I decided to do an experiment to find out. Our group melted aluminum in a steel pan usin g an oxy-acetylene torch. Then we added plastic shavings -- which immediately burned with a dark smoke, as the plastic floated on top of the hot molten aluminum. Next, we added wood chips (pine, oak and compressed fiber board chips) to the liquid aluminum. Again, we had fire a nd smoke, and again, the hydrocarbons floated on top as they burned. We poured out the aluminum and all three of us observed that it appeared silvery, not orange! We took photos and vi deos, so we will have the recorded evidence as these are processed. Of course, we saw a few bu rning embers, but this did not alter the silvery appearance of the flowing, falling aluminum. We decided to repeat the experiment, with t he same aluminum re-melted. This time when we added fresh wood chips to the hot molten aluminu m, we poured the aluminum-wood concoction out while the fire was still burning. An d as before, the wood floated on top of the liquid aluminum. While we could see embers of burni ng wood, we observed the bulk of the flowing aluminum to be silvery as always, as it fal ls through the air. This is a key to understanding why the alum inum does not \"glow orange\" due to partially- burned organics \"mixed\" in (per NIST theory) - beca use they do NOT mix in! My colleague noted that it is like oil and water - organics and molten aluminum do not mix. The hydrocarbons float to the top, and there burn - and embers glow, yes, but just in spots. The organics clearly do NOT impart to the hot liquid aluminum an \"orange gl ow\" when it falls, when you actually do the experiment! Videos of our experiments involving or ganics added to liquid aluminum are available here: http://www.scholarsfor911truth.org/Experiments-to-t est-NIST-orange-glow- hypothesis.html In the videos of the molten metal falling f rom WTC2 just prior to its collapse, the falling liquid appears consistently orange, not just orange in spots and certainly not silvery. We conclude from all these studies that the falling me tal which poured out of WTC2 is NOT aluminum. Not even aluminum \"mixed\" with organics a s NIST hypothesizes. However, if NIST will tell us how to mix organics into molten alumin um to get the “orange glow” observed with the liquid material as it flows out of the South To wer just before its collapse, we will be happy to try any experiment they suggest. We have tried aga in (October 3, 2006), this time with carpet remnants and glass added to wood/paper ash, all of this added to aluminum chips and pieces, which was then melted in a pot and stirred. Still the organics floated to the top (or most of them), and when the molten stuff was poured out, it appeared silvery-gray. No orange glow was observed in the falling, poured-out material.  It is important to note that initiatin g the thermite reaction requires temperatures well above those achieved by burning jet fuel or office materials -- which is an advantage of using thermite charges over conventional monomolecular ex plosives such as TNT, RDX and PETN. Below is a photograph of an experiment performed by the author and colleagues at BYU in which a sample of thermite was heated to orange-hot temperature (about 1700 o F). We demonstrated that the thermite reaction would not ignite at this high temperature. Later, the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 17 September 2006/Volume 3 thermite reaction was triggered by burning a magnes ium strip in contact with the thermite. An electrical superthermite \"match\" could have been us ed and remotely triggered via radio signal. Thermite did not ignite when heated with a propane torch. \"Superthermites\" use tiny particles of aluminum known as \"nanoaluminum\" (<120 nanometers) in order to increase their reactivity. Explosive superthermites are formed by mixing nanoaluminum powder with fine metal oxide pa rticles such as micron-scale iron oxide dust. \"Researchers can greatly increase the power of weapons by adding mat erials known as superthermites that combine nanometals such as nanoaluminum with metal oxides such as iron oxide , according to Steven Son, a project leader in the Explosives Science and Technology group at Los Alamos. \"The advantage (of using nanometals) is in how fast you can get their energy out,\" Son says. Son says tha t the chemical reactions of superthermites are faster and therefore release greater amounts of energy mo re rapidly... Son, who has been working on nanoenergetics for mor e than three years, says that scientists can engineer nanoaluminum powders with different particle sizes to vary the energy release rates . This enables the material to be used in many appl ications, including underwater explosive devices ... However, researchers aren't permitted to discuss what practical military applications may come from this research.\" (Gartner, January 2005) Based on these and other discoveries, the possibl e use of incendiary thermites and explosive superthermites on 9/11 should be investigated immediately and vig orously.

It is labeled “Red Hot Debris” and is published in LiRo News, Nov. 2001, http://www.liro.com/lironews.pdf . Moreover, there is recorded eyewitness testimony of the molten metal pools under both Towers and WTC 7; see: http://georgewashington.blogspot.com/2005/12/why-wa s-there-molten-metal- under.html . . A video clip provides eye-witness evidence regardin g this metal at ground zero: http://plaguepuppy.net/public_html/video%20archive/ red_hot_ground_zero_low_quality.wmv . Are there any examples of buildings top pled by fires or any reason other than deliberate demolition that show large pools of molten metal in the rubble? I have posed this question to numerous engineers and scientists, but so far no ex amples have emerged. Strange then that three buildings in Manhattan, supposedly brought down fin ally by fires, all show these large pools of molten metal in their basements post-collapse on 9- 11-2001. It would be interesting if underground fires could somehow produce large pools of molten steel, for example, but then there should be historical examples of this effect since there have been many large fires in numerous buildings. It is not enough to argue hypo thetically that fires could possibly cause all three pools of orange-hot molten metal. Furthermore, we have seen published rep orts that \"molten steel [or other metal] flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet\" -- how could building fires have caused that"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 19 September 2006/Volume 3 effect? Has it ever been seen before? We know of no such instances. However, thermite- derivative reactions as conjectured would produce m olten flowing iron, as observed. The very high temperatures (correspondi ng to salmon-yellow colors) of the molten metal observed in videos and photographs are difficult to explain in the context of the official theory that fires finally caused the collapse of the WTC T owers and WTC 7. Highly exothermic reactions other than jet-fuel or office-material fi res, such as thermite reactions which produce white-hot molten metal as an end product, are clear ly implied by the data. In addition, the use of explosives such as HMX or RDX should be considered. \"Superthermites\" are also explosive as must be remembered in any in-depth investigation which considers hypotheses suggested by the available data. The official reports by NIST, FEMA and the 9-11 Commission strikingly omit mention of large quantities of molten metal ob served in the basement areas of WTC 7 and the Towers. The facts that the official reports d o not address the molten metal pools or their chemical compositions provide compelling motivation for continued research on the WTC collapses. I appreciate all who have joined the in vestigation, including those at st911.org. 2. Observed Temperatures around 1000°C and Sulfidat ion in WTC 7 Steel One of the relatively few previous peer -reviewed papers relating to the WTC collapses provides \"An Initial Microstructural Analysis of A3 6 Steel from WTC Building 7.\" This brief but important letter states: While the exact location of this beam could not be determined, the unexpected erosion of the steel found in this beam warranted a study of microstructural changes that occurred in this steel. Examination of other secti ons in this beam is underway. ANALYSIS Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of he ating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to th e presence of sulfur . The formation of the eutectic mixture of iron oxide and iron sulfide lowers the temperature at which liquid can form in this steel. This strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached ~1000°C by a process similar to making a “blacksmith’s weld” in a hand forge. (Barnett, 200 1) How were these ~1000°C temperatures in the steel beam achieved? As noted above in the quotation from Eagar, it is difficult to reach temp eratures above 650°C in the type of diffuse fires evident in the WTC buildings, let alone in the stee l columns where heat is transported away by the enormous heat sink of the steel structure. So the high steel (not just air) temperatures deduced by Barnett, Biederman and Sisson are indeed remarkable. Then there is the rather mysterious sul fidation of the steel reported in this paper -- Wh at is the origin of this sulfur? No solid answer is g iven in any of the official reports. Of course, there is a straightforward w ay to achieve 1000°C temperatures (and well above) in the presence of sulfur, and that is to us e thermate (or a similar variation of thermite). Thermate is a high-level thermite analog containing sulfur developed by the military (see http://www.dodtechmatch.com/DOD/Patent/PatentDetail .aspx?type=description&id=6766744& HL=ON ). Thermate combines aluminum/iron oxide (thermit e) with barium nitrate (29%) and sulfur (typically 2% although more sulfur could be added). The thermate reaction proceeds rapidly and is much faster than thermite in degradi ng steel leading to structural failure. Thus, both the unusually high temperatures and the extrao rdinary observation of steel-sulfidation"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 20 September 2006/Volume 3 (Barnett, 2001) can be accounted for -- if the use of thermate is allowed in the discussion. Note that other oxidizers (like KMnO4) and metals (like titanium and silicon) are commonly used in thermite analogs. Finally, sulfidation was observed in st ructural steel samples found from both WTC7 and one of the WTC Towers, as reported in Appendix C in the FEMA report. It is quite possible that more than one type of cutter-charge was involved on 9/11, e.g., HMX, RDX and thermate in some combination. While gypsum in the buildings is a source of sulfur, it is highly unlikely that this sulfur could find its way into the structural steel in such a way as to form a eutectic. The evidence for the use of some variant of thermite su ch as sulfur-containing thermate in the destruction of the WTC Towers and building 7 is suf ficiently compelling to warrant serious investigation. 3. Near-Symmetrical Collapse of WTC 7 As you observed (link above), WTC 7 collapsed rapid ly and nearly-straight-down symmetrically -- even though fires were randomly sc attered in the building. WTC 7 fell about seven hours after the Towers collapsed, even though no major persistent fires were visible (considerable dark smoke was seen). There were twe nty-four huge steel support columns inside WTC 7 as well as huge trusses, arranged non-symmetr ically, along with some fifty-seven perimeter columns, as indicated in the diagram belo w (FEMA, 2002, chapter 5; NIST, 2005). Diagram showing steel-column arrangement in WTC 7, view looking down on the roof. Circled columns were possibly damaged due to debris from WTC 1 collapse, some 350 feet away (NIST, 2005) so the damage was clearly non-sym metrical, and evidently, none of the core columns was severed by falling debris. WTC 7 was never hit by a plane. A near-symmetrical collapse, as observed, evidently requires the simultaneous “pulling” of many of the support columns (see below, particul arly discussion of Bazant & Zhou paper). The likelihood of complete and nearly-symmetrical c ollapse due to random fires as in the “official” theory is small, since non-symmetrical f ailure is so much more likely. If one or a few"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 21 September 2006/Volume 3 columns had failed, one might expect a portion of t he building to crumble while leaving much of the building standing.

L'Ambiance Plaza collapse (right) shows how pancaked concrete floor slabs are largely intact and clearly reveal stacking effects with minimal fine dust, as expecte d from random progressive collapse.

The reader may wish to review controlled-demolition examples at http://www.implosionworld.com/cinema.htm for examples of complete symmetrical collapses due to c arefully pre-positioned explosives. (The videos of the Philips Building, Southwark Towers, a nd Schuylkill Falls Tower collapses are particularly instructive.) Concluding remarks in the FEMA report on the WTC 7 collapse lend support to these arguments: The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they ca used the building to collapse [“official theory”] remain unknown at this time. Al though the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis [fire/debris-damage- caused collapse] has only a low probability of occu rrence. Further research, investigation, and analyses are needed to resolve t his issue . (FEMA, 2002, chapter 5; emphasis added.) That is precisely the point: further investigation and analyses are indeed needed, including serious consideration of the controlled-demolition hypothesis which is neglected in all of the government reports (FEMA, NIST and 9-11 Commission reports). Note that the 9-11 Commission report does not even mention the collaps e of WTC 7 on 9-11-01. (Commission, 2004) This is a striking omission of data highly relevant to the question of what really happened on 9-11. 4. No Previous Skyscraper Complete Collapse Due to Fires A New York Times article entitled “Engineers are baffled over the c ollapse of 7 WTC; Steel members have been partly evaporated,” provide s relevant data. Experts said no building like it [WTC7], a modern, steel-reinforced high-rise, had ever collapsed because of an uncontrolled fire . (Glanz, 2001; emphasis added.) Fire engineering expert Norman Glover agrees: Almost all large buildings will be the location for a major fire in their useful life. No major high-rise building has ever collapsed from fire ... The WTC [itself] was the location for s uch a fire in 1975; however, the building survived with minor damage and was repaired and returned to service.” (Glover, 2002) That’s correct – no steel-beam high-rise had ever b efore (or since) completely collapsed due to fires! However, such complete and nearly symmetric al collapses in tall steel-frame buildings have occurred many times before -- all of them due to pre-positioned explosives in a procedure called “implosion” or controlled demolition. What a surprise, then, for such an occurrence in downtown Manhattan— three skyscrapers completely co llapsed on the same day, September 11, 2001, presumably without the use of explosives. Engineers have been trying to figure out exactly wh at happened and whether they should be worried about other buildings like it around the country... Most of the other buildings"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 23 September 2006/Volume 3 in the [area] stood despite suffering damage of all kinds, including fire... ‘Fire and the structural damage ...would not explain steel members in the debris pile that appe ar to have been partly evaporated’ , Dr. [Jonathan] Barnett said. (Glanz, 2001; empha sis added.) The observed “partly evaporated” steel members is p articularly upsetting to the official theory, since fires involving paper, office materials, even diesel fuel, cannot generate temperatures anywhere near the ~5,180 o F (~2860 o C) needed to evaporate steel. (Recall that WTC 7 wa s not hit by a jet, so there was no jet fuel involved in the fires in this building.) However, thermite- variants, RDX and other commonly-used incendiaries or explosives (i.e., cutter-charges) can readily slice through steel, thus cutting the suppo rt columns in a controlled demolition, and reach the required temperatures. This mystery needs to b e explored – but is not mentioned in the “official” 9-11 Commission or NIST reports. 5. Plume-timing during the Collapse of WTC 7 Horizontal puffs or plumes of smoke and debris are observed emerging from WTC-7 on upper floors, in regular sequence, just as the buil ding starts to collapse. (The reader may wish to view the close-up video clip again.) The upper flo ors have evidently not moved relative to one another yet, from what one can observe from the vid eos. In addition, the timing between the puffs is less than 0.2 seconds so air-expulsion due to collapsing floors (see Chertoff, 2005) is evidently excluded. Free-fall time for a floor to f all down to the next floor is significantly longer than 0.2 seconds: the equation for free fall, y = ½ gt 2 , yields a little over 0.6 seconds, as this is near the initiation of the collapse. However, the presence of such “squibs” proceeding u p the side of the building is common when pre-positioned explosives are used, as can be observed at http://www.implosionworld.com/cinema.htm The same site shows that rapid timing between explosive squibs is also common. (It is instructive to view several of the implosion videos at this web site.) Thus, squibs as observed during the col lapse of WTC 7 going up the side of the building in rapid sequence provide additional signi ficant evidence for the use of pre-placed explosives. Release by the government (NIST, in particular) of all videographic and photographic data showing details of the fires, dam age, and collapse of WTC 7 on 9/11/2001would allow us to analyze these plume data in greater detail , to determine whether breaking windows or explosive charges are evidenced in the observed puffs of smoke. Horizontal plumes and sounds of explosions are even more pronounced in available videos of the collapses of the WTC Towers (see sections 7 and 8 b elow). Regarding this highly-secure building , a NY Times article entitled “ Secretive C.I.A. Site in New York was Destroyed on Sept. 11 ,” provides an intriguing puzzle piece: \"The C.I.A.'s undercover New York station was i n the 47-story building at 7 World Trade Center ... All of the agency's employees at the site were sa fely evacuated... The intelligence agency's employees were able to watch from their office windows while the twin towers burned just before th ey evacuated their own building.\" (Risen, 2001) "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 24 September 2006/Volume 3 6. Early Drop of North Tower Antenna The official FEMA 9-11 report admits a striking ano maly regarding the North Tower collapse: Review of videotape recordings of the collapse taken from various angles indicates that the transmission tower on top of the structure bega n to move downward and laterally slightly before movement was evident at the exterio r wall. This suggests that collapse began with one or more failures in the central core area of the building. (FEMA, 2002, chapter 2; emphasis added.)

(See http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/videos/wtc 1_close_frames.html ; also http://home.comcast.net/~skydrifter/collapse.htm .) A NY Times article also notes this behavior: The building stood for more than an hour and a half . Videos of the north tower's collapse appear to show that its television antenna began to drop a fraction of a second before the rest of the building. The observations suggest that the building's steel core somehow gave way first ... (Glanz and Lipton, 2002; emphasis added) But how? What caused the 47 enormous steel core col umns of this building which supported the antenna to evidently give way nearly simultaneously , if not cutter charges? The anomalous early antenna-drop was note d by the FEMA report (FEMA, 2002) and the New York Times (Glanz and Lipton, 2002) yet not resolved in the o fficial reports (FEMA, 2002; Commission, 2004; NIST, 2005).

Furthermore, the FEMA investigators also revi ewed \"videotape recordings of the collapse taken from various angles\" yet came to the sense th at \" collapse began with one or more failures in the central core area of the building.\" (FEMA, 2002) Quantitative analysis needs to be done and shown to resolve the issue. Gordon Ross has written a scholarly p aper on the collapse of WTC 1, which carefully considers conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, here: http://www.journalof911studies.com/ . He shows that even if the Tower started to coll apse due to fire and damage, it would not continue to complete collapse. Note that the collapse of the McCormick Place building in Chicago is an example o f a partial collapse only of a steel-frame building due to fire. The roof collapsed, but sinc e the walls of that one-story building remained standing, it is clearly not comparable to the complete collapses of three WTC skyscrapers on 9/11/2000. 7. Eyewitness Accounts of Flashes and Loud Explosio ns Multiple loud explosions in rapid sequence were heard and reported by numerous observers in and near the WTC Towers, consistent wi th explosive demolition. Firemen and others described flashes and explosions in upper fl oors near where the plane entered, and in lower floors of WTC 2 just prior to its collapse, f ar below the region where the plane had struck the tower (Dwyer, 2005). For instance, at the star t of the collapse of the South Tower a Fox News anchor reported: There is an explosion at the base of the building... white smoke from the bottom ... something happened at the base of the building! Th en another explosion.” (De Grand Pre, 2002, emphasis added.) Firefighter Edward Cachia independently reported: [We] thought there was like an internal detonation, explosives, because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the to wer came down...It actually gave at a lower floor, not the floor where the plan e hit. (Dwyer, 2005; emphasis added.) And Assistant Fire Commissioner Stephen Gregory pro vides additional insights: When I looked in the direction of the Trade Center before it came down, before No. 2 came down, ..I saw low-level flashes. In my convers ation with Lieutenant Evangelista, never mentioning this to him, he questioned me and asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the building, and I agreed with him bec ause I thought -- at that time I didn't know what it was.

It is highly unlikely that jet fuel was present to generate such explosions especially on lower floors, and long after the planes hit the bui ldings. Dr. Shyam Sunder, Lead Investigator for NIST stated: \"The jet fuel probably burned out in l ess than 10 minutes.” (Field, 2005) \"Electrical explosions\" would clearly be insufficie nt to bring a steel-frame skyscraper down, in any building built to code. On the other hand, pre -positioned explosives provide a plausible and simple explanation for the observed detonations fol lowed by complete building collapses. Thus, it cannot be said that “no evidence” can be found f or the use of explosives. This serious matter needs to be treated as a plausible scientific hypot hesis and thoroughly investigated. \"118 Witnesses: The Firefighters’ Testimony to Explosio ns in the Twin Towers\" by Graeme MacQueen in http://www.journalof911studies.com/ provides significant details regarding eyewitness accounts. Another (shorter) summary is given here: http://911proof.com/11.html . 8. Ejection of Steel Beams and Debris-plumes from t he Towers The horizontal ejection of structural steel membe rs for hundreds of feet and the pulverization of concrete to flour-like powder, obs erved clearly in the collapses of the WTC towers, provide further evidence for the use of exp losives – as well-explained in http://911research.wtc7.net/talks/towers/index.html . (See also, Griffin, 2004, chapter 2.) The observed plumes or \"squibs\" are far below the pulve rization region and therefore deserving of particular attention. They appear much like the pl umes observed in http://www.implosionworld.com/cinema.htm (e.g., the controlled demolition of the Southwark Towers)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 27 September 2006/Volume 3  North Tower during top-down collapse. Notice mysterious horizontal pl umes far below pulverization region. Unlike WTC7, the twin towers appear to have been ex ploded “top-down” rather than proceeding from the bottom – which is unusual for controlled d emolition but clearly possible, depending on the order in which explosives are detonated. That i s, explosives may have been placed on higher floors of the towers and exploded via radio signals so as to have early explosions near the region where the plane entered the tower. Certainly this hypothesis ought to be seriously considered in an independent investigation using all available da ta. 9. Rapid Collapses and Conservation of Momentum and Energy The NIST team fairly admits that their report “does not actually include the structural behavior of the tower after the conditions for coll apse initiation were reached. ” (NIST, 2005, p. 80, fn. 12; emphasis added.) Quite a co nfession, since much of the external evidence for explosive demolition typically comes after collapse initiation, as seen in cases of acknowledged controlled demolition. (Harris, 2000. ) The NIST report could be called the official \"pre-collapse theory.\" The rapid fall of the Towers and WTC7 has been anal yzed by several engineers/scientists ( http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/spe ed.html ; Griffin, 2004, chapter 2). The roof of WTC 7 (students and I are observing the southwest corner as it commences its steady fall) falls to earth in (6.5 +- 0.2) seconds, while an ob ject dropped from the roof (in a vacuum) would hit the ground in 6.0 seconds. This follows from t = (2H/g) 1/2 . Likewise, the Towers fall very"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 28 September 2006/Volume 3 rapidly to the ground, with the upper part falling nearly as rapidly as ejected debris which provide free-fall references ( http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/proofs/spe ed.html ; Griffin, 2004, chapter 2). Where is the delay that must be expected due to conservation of momentum – one of the foundational Laws of Physics? That is, as upper-falling floors strike lower floors – and intact steel support columns – the fall must be significantly impeded by the impacted mass. If the central support columns remained standing, t hen the effective resistive mass would be less, but this is not the case – somehow the enormous sup port columns failed/disintegrated along with the falling floor pans. Peer-reviewed papers which further analyze the WTC skyscraper collapses, by Dr. Frank Legge, Professor Kenneth K uttler, Gordon Ross and Kevin Ryan, are recommended and available here: http://www.journalof911studies.com/ . How do the upper floors fall so quickly, then, and still conserve momentum and energy in the collapsing buildings? The contradiction is ign ored by FEMA, NIST and 9-11 Commission reports where conservation of energy and momentum a nd the fall-times were not analyzed. Gordon Ross argues that when conservation of energy and momentum are factored in, then a gravity-driven collapse will be arrested, so that o nly a partial collapse of the Tower would occur (see http://www.journalof911studies.com/ , Gordon Ross). The paradox is easily resolved by the explosive demolition hypothesis, whereby explosives quickly remove lower-floor material including steel support columns and allow near free -fall-speed collapses (Harris, 2000). And these explosives also readily account for the t urning of the falling Towers to fine dust as the collapse ensues. Rather than a piling u p with shattering of concrete as we might expect from non-explosive-caused progressive collap se (“official theory”), we find that most of the Towers material (concrete, carpet, etc.) is con verted to flour-like powder WHILE the buildings are falling. The Towers’ collapses are n ot typical random collapses, but quite possibly a series of “shock-and-awe” explosions coupled with the use of thermate-incendiaries – at least the evidence points strongly in this direction. Th e hypothesis ought to be explored further. Those who wish to preserve fundamental physical law s as inviolate may wish to take a closer look.

What happens to the block and its angula r momentum? We observe that approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east. They begin to topple over, not fall straight down. The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then – a nd this I’m still puzzling over – this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air ! How can we understand this strange behavior, with out explosives? Remarkable, amazing – and demanding sc rutiny since the US government-funded reports failed to analyze this phenomenon. But, of course, the Final NIST 9-11 report “ does not actually include the structural behavior of the tow er after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached.” (NIST, 2005, p. 80, fn. 12; emphasis added.) Indeed, if we seek the truth of the matter, we must NOT ignore the data to be observed during the actual collapses of the towers, as the N IST team admits they did. But why did they follow such a non-scientific procedure as to ignore highly-relevant data? The business smacks of political constraints on what was supposed to be an “open and thorough” investigation. (See Mooney, 2005.) So I with others call for an open and thorough inve stigation. I hope the international community will rise to the challenge.

Controlled Demolition “Implosions” Require Ski ll The occurrence of nearly symmetrical, straight-down and complete collapses of the WTC 7 and the Towers is particularly upsetting to the “offic ial” theory that random fires plus damage caused all these collapses. Even with high- level cutting charges, achieving such results requires a great deal of pre-planning and expertise . As Tom Harris, an authority in this field, has explained: The main challenge in bringing a building down is c ontrolling which way it falls . Ideally, a blasting crew will be able to tumble the building over on one side , into a parking lot or other open area. This sort of blast is the easiest to execute. Tipping a building over is something like felling a tree. To topple the building to the north, the blasters detonate explosives on the north side of t he building first... Sometimes, though, a building is surrounded by stru ctures that must be preserved. In this case, the blasters proceed with a true implosion, demolishing the building so that it collapses straight down into its own footprint (the total area at the base of the building). This feat requires such skill that only a handful o f demolition companies in the world will attempt it. Blasters approach each project a little differently ... [A good] option is to detonate the columns at the center of the building before the ot her columns so that the building's sides fall inward .... Generally speaking, blasters will explode the major support columns on the lower floors first and then a few up per stories ... [nb: The upper floors then fall as a tamper, resulting in “progressive co llapse”-- this is common in controlled demolition.] (Harris, 2000; emphasis added.) Careful observation of the collapse of WTC 7 (video clips above) demonstrates a downward “kink” near the center of the building first, sugge sting “pulling” of the support columns, then the building’s sides pull inward such that the building “collapses straight down into its own footprint” (Harris, 2000). The plumes of debris ob served on upper floors of WTC 7 as the collapse begins appear consistent with explosive cu tting of supports for \"a few upper stories\" as outlined above. FEMA admitted that WTC 7 collapse d onto a well-confined footprint: The collapse of WTC 7 had a small debris field as t he facade was pulled downward, suggesting an internal failure and implosion ... The average debris field radius was approximately 70 feet. (FEMA, 2002, chapter 5.) Evidently we agree that this was a beautifully done implosion in the collapse of WTC 7, and yet: This feat requires such skill that only a handful o f demolition companies in the world will attempt it. (Harris, 2000 ; emphasis added. ) Consider: Why would terrorists undertake straight- down collapses of WTC7 and the Towers, when “toppling-over” falls would require much less work and would do much more damage in downtown Manhattan? And where would they obtain th e necessary skills and access to the buildings for a symmetrical implosion anyway? Thes e questions suggest the need for further investigation. One of the people a thorough investigation should q uestion would be demolition expert Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. Speaking of the way the WTC buildings came down, he said in an interview: “ If I were to bring the towers down, I would"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 31 September 2006/Volume 3 put explosives in the basement to get the weight of the building to help collapse the structure. ” (Bollyn, 2002; emphasis added.) Just right – “explosives in the basement” agrees wi th eyewitness reports of pre-collapse explosions down low in the buildings (point 7 above ). Also, this would be the way to effectively sever the support columns, consistent with both the apparent initial drop of the communication tower (WTC Tower 1) and the “kink” in the middle of WTC 7 as its collapse began. Yes, and as president of Controlled Demolition, Inc., Mr. Loize aux would know the “handful of demolition companies in the world [that] will attempt” a symme trical controlled demolition or \"implosion\". (Harris, 2000) His company is certainly one of the se and was hired to help in the rapid clean-up work following the building collapses. In summary, we have discovered substantial evidence supporting the idea that thermites were used on the steel columns of the WTC Tower to weaken the huge steel supports, not long before explosives finished the demolition job. We can next estimate the amount of explosives needed by comparing with a known controlled demolit ion: the explosive demolition of the Landmark Tower. “The explosive charges used to bring down the Landmark T ower [380 ft tall, 30 stories] weighed only 364 pounds [165 kilograms], consisting of 198 pounds of 60-percent nitroglycerine-based gel in 1-1/4 inc h sticks, and 166 pounds of RDX (a C-4 derivative).\" http://www.acppubs.com/article/CA6325450.html Scaling to the 110-story WTC Towers, roughly 1300 pounds [590 kg] of explosives per Tower would suffice . Scaling to the size of WTC 7, 570 pounds [260 kg ] would be indicated. The videos referenced above show WTC 7 falling top-down , in conventional controlled demolition fashion. On the other hand, the Towers were eviden tly demolished from the top downward, which although unusual is certainly possible using explosives. Indeed, for very tall towers such as these, top-down demolition seems be the best app roach, to avoid toppling over of the tower onto surrounding buildings. Explosives such as RDX, or HMX, or su perthermites, when pre-positioned by a small team of operatives , would suffice to cut the supports at key points s uch that these tall buildings would completely collapse with little damage to sur rounding buildings. Radio-initiated firing of the charges is implicated here, perhaps using superthermite ma tches. (See http://www.journalof911studies.com/JonesAnswersQues tionsWorldTradeCenter.pdf .) Using computer-controlled radio signals, it would be an e asy matter to begin the explosive demolition near the point of entry of the planes in the Towers (to make it appear that the planes somehow initiated the collapse.) In this scenario, linear cutter-charges would have been placed at numerous points in the building, mostly on the crit ical core columns, since one would not know beforehand exactly where the planes would enter."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 32 September 2006/Volume 3 Above: two men install a conventional cutter c harge to steel column, preparing for a controlled demolition of the building.

Steel Column Temperatures of 800°C Needed: A Problem in the Argument of Bazant and Zhou A Mechanical Engineering professor suggested that I review a paper by Zedenek P. Bazant and Yong Zhou, which I did. Quoting: The 110-story towers of the World Trade Ce nter were designed to withstand as a whole the forces caused by a horizontal impact of a large commercial aircraft. So why did a total collapse occur? (Bazant and Zhou, 2 002, p. 2.) Correct – the WTC Towers were designed to withstand forces caused by large commercial aircraft – we can agree on that. MIT’s Thomas Eaga r also concurs “because the number of columns lost on the initial impact was not large an d the loads were shifted to remaining columns in this highly redundant structure” (Eagar and Muss o, 2001). We continue with Bazant & Zhou: The conflagration, caused by the aircraft fuel spil led into the structure, causes the steel of the columns to be exposed to sustained temperatures apparently exceeding 800 o C ... (Bazant and Zhou, 2002, p. 2.) But here we note from the recent NIST report that: “ The initial jet fuel fires themselves lasted at most a few minutes ” and office material fires would burn out within a bout 20 minutes in a given location. (NIST, 2005; p. 179, emphasis added .) Certainly jet fuel burning was not enough to raise steel to sustained temperatures abo ve 800 o C, although air temperatures could have exceeded that value. But we continue: Once more than half of the columns in the critical floor.. suffer buckling (stage 3), the weight of the upper part of the structure above this floor can no longer be supported, and so the upper part starts falling down onto the lower part below...”(Bazant and Zhou, 2002, p. 2.) Bazant & Zhou do not explain how “more than half of the columns in the critical floor [can] suffer buckling” at the same time to precipitate th e complete and nearly symmetrical collapse observed. There were 47 huge steel core columns in each Tower, and 24 such support columns in WTC 7 (NIST 2005; NISTb, 2005). "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 34 September 2006/Volume 3  The WTC towers were solidly constructed with 47 steel core columns and 240 perimeter steel columns. 2 87 steel-columns total.

Notice workers standing on floor pan which is firmly attached to the interconnected core columns. Clearly, the Towers were not “hollow tubes.” They do NOT explain how steel-column temperatures a bove 800 o C were achieved near- simultaneously due to burning office materials. NI ST notes that office materials in an area burn for about 15-20 minutes, then are consumed away (NI ST, 2005, pp. 117, 179). This is evidently not long enough to raise steel column temperatures above 800 o C as required in the Bazant & Zhou model, given the enormous heat sinks of the st ructures. And to have three buildings completely collapse due to this unlikely mechanism on the same day strains credulity. Moreover, the Final NIST report on the Towers admit s: Of the more than 170 areas examined on 16 perimeter column panels, only three columns had evidence that the steel reached temperatures ab ove 250ºC... Only two core column specimens had sufficient paint remaining to make su ch an analysis, and their temperatures did not reach 250 ºC. ... Using metall ographic analysis, NIST determined that there was no evidence that any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 ºC . (NIST, 2005, pp. 176-177; emphasis added.) "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 36 September 2006/Volume 3 Relevant to this point, Eagar noted that \"Factors s uch as flame volume and quantity of soot decrease the radiative heat loss in the fire, moving the temperature closer to the maximum of 1,000 ºC.\" (Eagar and Musso, 2001) While this is the maximum air temperature possible in the WTC fires, this does not mean that the structur al steel reached this temperature in the time the fires acted. Indeed, NIST emphasizes that ther e was no evidence that \"any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 ºC.\" This state ment is consistent with their data plots of \"predicted column temperatures\", which \"shows maxim um temperature reached by each column\" in that no temperature above 600 ºC is given for an y of the steel columns. (NIST, 2005.) As for WTC 7, Bazant & Zhou say little but mention in a separate “addendum” that burning natural gas might have been a source of the needed heat (Bazant and Zhou, March 2002, p. 370). The FEMA report (FEMA, 2002) addresses this issue: Early news reports had indicated that a high pressu re, 24-inch gas main was located in the vicinity of the building [WTC 7]; however, this proved not to be true .\" (FEMA, 2002, chapter 5; emphasis added.) 12. Problems in the NIST Report: Inadequate Steel Temperatures and Tweaked Models I have read through the hundreds of pages of the Final NIST report on the collapses of the WTC Towers. (NIST, 2005) It is interesting to note that NIST “decoupled” and delayed their final report on WTC 7, which is overdue as of this writing (NIST, 2005; NISTb, 2005). I agree with some of the NIST report; for example: Both WTC 1 and WTC 2 were stable after the aircraft impact, standing for 102 min and 56 min, respectively . The global analyses with structural impact damag e showed that both towers had considerable reserve capacity . This was confirmed by analysis of the post-impact vibration of WTC 2... where the damag ed tower oscillated at a period nearly equal to the first mode period calculated fo r the undamaged structure. (NIST, 2005, p. 144; emphasis added.) At any given location, the duration of [air, not steel] temperatures near 1,000 o C was about 15 min to 20 min. The rest of the time , the calculated temperatures were near 500 o C or below .” (NIST, 2005, p. 127, emphasis added.) NIST contracted with Underwriters Laboratories, Inc . to conduct tests to obtain information on the fire endurance of trusses like t hose in the WTC towers... All four test specimens sustained the maximum design lo ad for approximately 2 hours without collapsing .” (NIST, 2005, p. 140, emphasis added.) However, I along with others challenge NIST’s colla pse theory. NIST maintains that all three building collapses were fire-initiated despit e the observations above, particularly the fact that fire endurance tests with actual models did no t result in collapse. In a paper by fire- engineering experts in the UK, we find: The basis of NIST’s collapse theory is... column beha viour in fire... However , we believe that a considerable difference in downward displace between the [47] core and [240] perimeter columns, much greater than the 300 mm proposed, is required for the collapse theory to hold true... [Our] lower reliance on passive fire protection is in contrast to the NIST work where the amount of fire protection on the truss elements is"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 37 September 2006/Volume 3 believed to be a significant factor in defining the time to collapse... The [proposed effect] is swamped by thermal expansion ... Thermal expansion and the response of the whole frame to this effect has NOT been described a s yet [by NIST]. (Lane and Lamont, 2005.) I agree with these pointed objections, particularly that the “response of the whole frame” of each building should be considered, especially heat tran sport to the whole frame from localized fires, and that the “core columns cannot pull the exterior columns in via the floor.” (Lane and Lamont, 2005) The computerized models of the Towers in the NIST s tudy, which incorporate many features of the buildings and the fires on 9-11-01, are less than convincing. The Final report states: The Investigation Team then defined three cas es for each building by combining the middle, less severe, and more severe values of the influent ial variables. Upon a preliminary examination of the middle cases, it became clear that the towers would likely remain standing. The less severe cases were discarded after the aircraft impact results were compared to observed events. The middle cases (which became Case A for WTC 1 and Case C for WTC 2) were discarded after the structural response analysis of major subsystem s were compared to observed events. (NIST, 2005, p. 142; emphasis added.) The NIST report makes for interesting read ing. The less severe cases based on empirical data were discarded because they did not result in building collapse. But ‘one must save the hypothesis,’ so more severe cases were tried and th e simulations tweaked, as we read in the NIST report: The more severe case (which became Case B for WTC 1 and Case D for WTC 2) was used for the global analysis of each tower. Complet e sets of simulations were then performed for Cases B and D. To the extent that the simulations deviated from th e photographic evidence or eyewitness reports [e.g., complete collapse occurred], the investigators adjusted the input , but only within the range of physical reality. Th us, for instance,...the pulling forces on the perimeter c olumns by the sagging floors were adjusted ... (NIST, 2005, p. 142; emphasis added.) The primary role of the floors in the collapse of the t owers was to provide inward pull forces that induced inward bowing of perimeter columns. (NIST, 2005, p. 180; emphasis added.) How fun (perhaps) to tweak the model like that, unt il the building collapses -- until one gets the desired result. But the end result of such tweaked computer hypotheticals is not compelling. Notice that the “ the pulling forces on the perimeter columns by the sagging floors were adjusted ” (NIST, 2005, p. 142; emphasis added) to get the per imeter columns to yield sufficiently – one suspects these were “adjusted” by hand quite a bit -- even though the UK experts complained that “ the core columns cannot pull the exterior [i.e., perimeter] columns in via the floor.” (Lane and Lamont, 2005; emphasis added.) I also agree with Kevin Ryan’s objections regarding the NIST study. Kevin Ryan, at the time a manager at Underwriters Laboratories (UL), m akes a point of the non-collapse of actual WTC-based models in his letter to Frank Gayle of NI ST: "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 38 September 2006/Volume 3 As I'm sure you know, the company I work for certif ied the steel components used in the construction of the WTC buildings. In requesting in formation from both our CEO and Fire Protection business manager last year... they su ggested we all be patient and understand that UL was working with your team... I'm aware of UL's attempts to help, including performing tests on models of the floor assemblies. But the results of these tests... indicate that the buildings should have easi ly withstood the thermal stress caused by... burning [jet fuel, paper, etc.] . (Ryan, 2004) That models of WTC trusses at Underwriter Laborator ies (UL) subjected to fires did NOT fail is also admitted in the final NIST report: NIST contracted with Underwriters Laboratories, Inc . to conduct tests to obtain information on the fire endurance of trusses like t hose in the WTC towers.... All four test specimens sustained the maximum design lo ad for approximately 2 hours without collapsing ... The Investigation Team was cautious about using t hese results directly in the formulation of collapse hypotheses. In addition to the scaling issues raised by the test results, the fires in the towers on Sep tember 11, and the resulting exposure of the floor systems, were substantially different fro m the conditions in the test furnaces. Nonetheless, the [empirical test] results established that this type of assembly was capable of sustaining a large gravity load, without collapsing, for a substantial period of time relative to the duration of the fire s in any given location on September 11 . (NIST, 2005, p. 141; emphasis added.) So how does the NIST team justify the WTC collapses , when actual models fail to collapse and there are zero examples of fire-caused high-rise co llapses? Easy, NIST concocted computer- generated hypotheticals for very “severe” cases, ca lled cases B and D (NIST, 2005, pp. 124- 138). Of course, the details are rather hidden to us. And they omit consideration of the complete, rapid and symmetrical nature of the colla pses. Indeed, NIST makes the startling admission in a foo tnote on page 80 of their Final Report: The focus of the Investigation was on the sequen ce of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower . For brevity in this report, this sequence is referred to as the \"probable collapse sequence,\" although it does not actually include the structural behavior of the tower after the cond itions for collapse initiation were reached ...(NIST, 2005, p. 80, fn. 12; emphasis added.) Again, on page 142, NIST admits that their computer simulation only proceeds until the building is “poised for collapse”, thus ignoring any data fr om that time on. The results were a simulation of the structural deterioration of each tower from the time of aircraft impact to the time at which the building became unstable, i.e., was poised for collapse. ...(NIST, 2005, p. 142; emphasis added.) What about the subsequent complete, rapid and symme trical collapse of the buildings? What about the observed squibs? What about the antenna dropping first in the North Tower? What about the molten metal observed in the basement are as in large pools in both Towers and WTC 7 as well? Never mind all that: NIST did not discuss at all any data after the buildings were “poised for collapse.” Well, some of us want to lo ok at ALL the data, without \"black-box\" computer simulations that are “adjusted,” perhaps t o make them fit the desired outcome.

NIST's Failure to Show Visualizations An article in the journal New Civil Engineering (NCE) lends support to concerns about the NIST analysis of the WTC collapses. It states: World Trade Center disaster investigators [at NIST] are refusing to show computer visualizations of the collapse of the Twin Towers despite calls from leading structural and fire engineers, NCE has learned. Visualisations of collapse mechanisms are routinely used to validate the type of finite element analysis model used by the [NIST] investigators. The collapse mechanism and the role played by the hat truss at the top of the tower has been the focu s of debate since the US National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) publishe d its findings.... University of Manchester [U.K.] professor of struct ural engineering Colin Bailey said there was a lot to be gained from visualising the s tructural response. “NIST should really show the visualisations; otherwise the oppor tunity to correlate them back to the video evidence and identify any errors in the m odeling will be lost ,” he said.... A leading US structural engineer said NIST had obvi ously devoted enormous resources to the development of the impact and fire models. “By comparison the global structural model is not as sophisticated,” he said. “T he software used [by NIST] has been pushed to new limits, and there have been a lo t of simplifications, extrapolations and judgment calls.” (Parker, 2005; emphasis added.) Here we have serious concerns about the NIST WTC co llapse report raised by structural and fire engineers, augmenting the arguments raised here by a physicist. The thirteen points above provide scientific data a nd analyses that support my call for an immediate investigation of 9/11 events, while chall enging the official story. A few other considerations provide further motivation for the p roposed urgent investigation. Some Additional Considerations “Burning Questions that Need Answers” I agree with this urgent yet reasoned ass essment of expert fire-protection engineers, as boldly editorialized in the journal Fire Engineering: Respected members of the fire protection en gineering community are beginning to raise red flags, and a resonating theory has emerge d: The structural damage from the planes and the explo sive ignition of jet fuel in themselves were not enough to bring down the towers ...."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 40 September 2006/Volume 3 Fire Engineering has good reason to believe that the \"official investigation\" blessed by FEMA and run by the American Society of Civil Engineers is a half- baked farce that may already have been commandeered by political forces whose primary interests, to put it mildly, lie far afield of full disclosure. Except for the marginal benefit obtained from a three-day, visual walk-through of evidence sites conducted by ASCE investigation committee members- described by one close source as a \"tourist trip\"-no one's checking the evidence for anything. Some citizens are taking to the streets to protest the investigation sellout . Sally Regenhard, for one, wants to know why and how the b uilding fell as it did upon her unfortunate son Christian, an FDNY probationary fir efighter. And so do we. Clearly , there are burning questions that need answers. Ba sed on the incident's magnitude alone, a full-throttle, fully resourced, forensic investigation is imperative . More important, from a moral standpoint, [are consi derations] for the safety of present and future generations ... (Manning, 2002; emphasis added). This editorial does not mention the controlled-demo lition hypothesis, but rightfully objects to the rapid destruction of the structural steel which wou ld provide crucial evidence from the crime scene. We agree that such destruction of evidence is wrong, and that a thorough investigation is imperative. For more than three months, structural steel from the World Trade Center has been and continues to be cut up and sold for scrap. Crucial evidence that could answer many questions about high-rise building desi gn practices and performance under fire conditions is on the slow boat to China , perhaps never to be seen again in America until you buy your next car.   Such destruction of evidence shows the astounding i gnorance of government officials to the value of a thorough, scientific in vestigation of the largest fire-induced collapse in world history. I have combed through ou r national standard for fire investigation, NFPA 921, but nowhere in it does one find an exemption allowing the destruction of evidence for buildings over 10 stori es tall .

In an editorial in Fire Engineering , September, 2004, Bill Manning criticizes the 9/11 Commission report and renews his call for a new inv estigation, the major goal of this paper also: The recommendations contained within Chapter 9 of t he 9/11 Commission Report, the chapter dealing with emergency response, are disapp ointingly sparse in details. Surely, the largest and most tragic emergency response in h istory demands a more intensive, more critical investigative effort, especially sinc e the 9/11 Commission touts its effort as the \"definitive account\" of the incident. More impo rtantly, the response community, the public, and the fallen heroes and their families de serve the naked truth, whatever that may be .

To do anything less would be a disservice to the 343 brothers and all the other good people who perished that day , a disservice to our nation, and a disservice to ourselves. (Manning, 2004) Analysis by Whistleblower Ryan Kevin Ryan, the whistleblower from Underwriters L aboratories, did his own brief statistical analysis in a recent letter regarding t he NIST report, arguing that probabilities of collapse-initiation needed to be calculated (Ryan, 2005). NIST nowhere provides such a likelihood analysis for their non-explosive collaps e model. Ryan’s estimate is that the probability that fires and damage (the “official th eory”) could cause the Towers complete collapse is less than one in a trillion , and the probability is much less still when the c omplete collapse of WTC7 is included: To follow the latest \"leading hypothesis\" [of NIST ], what are the odds that all the fireproofing fell off in just the right places, even far from t he point of impact? Without much test data, let's say it's one in a thousand. A nd what are the odds that the office furnishings converged to supply highly directed and (somehow) forced-oxygen fires at very precise points on the remaining columns? Is it another one in a thousand? What is the chance that those points would then all soften in unison, and give way perfectly, so that the highly dubious \"progressive global collaps e\" theory could be born? I wouldn't even care to guess. But finally, with well over a h undred fires in tall buildings through history, what are the chances that the first, secon d and third incidents of fire-induced collapse would all occur on the same day? Let's say it's one in a million. Considering just these few points we're looking at a one in a trilli on chance, using generous estimates and not really considering the third building (no plane , no jet fuel, different construction [for WTC 7]). How convenient that our miraculous resu lt, combined with several other trains of similarly unlikely events [no interception of hijac ked planes by the military on 9/11, etc.], gives us reason to invade the few most strategicall y important lands for the production of oil and natural gas...” (Ryan, 2005). Nor does NIST (or FEMA or the 9-11 Commission) even mention the molten metals found in the basements of all three buildings (WTC 1, 2 and 7). So where does that leave us? I strongly agree with Kevin Ryan when he says, This [“official”] story just does not add up.... Tha t fact should be of great concern to all Americans.... There is no question that the e vents of 9/11 are the emotional driving force behind the War on Terror. And the is sue of the WTC collapse is at the crux of the story of 9/11.

"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 42 September 2006/Volume 3 Faculty Support Investigation I presented my objections to the “official” theor y at a seminar at BYU on September 22, 2005, to about sixty people. I also showed evidence and scientific arguments for the controlled demolition theory. In attendance were faculty from Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, Ge ology, and Mathematics – and perhaps other departments as I did not recognize all of the peopl e present. A local university and college were represented (BYU and Utah Valley State College). The discussion was vigorous and lasted nearly two h ours. It ended only when a university class needed the room. After presenting the material summarized here, including actually looking at and discussing the collapses of WTC 7 and the Towers, only one attendee disagreed (by hand-vote) that further investigation of the WTC collapses was called for. The next day, the dissenting professor said he had furt her thought about it and now agreed that more investigation was needed. He joined the others in hoping that the 6,899 photographs and 6,977 segments of video footage held by NIST plus others held by the FBI would be released for independent scrutiny; photos largely from private p hotographers (NIST, 2005, p. 81). Therefore, I along with others call for the release of these data to a cross-disciplinary, preferably international team of scientists and eng ineers. Note that I did not ask if those present believed that the WTC Towers and WTC 7 had been bro ught down by explosives. Rather, I asked if they agreed with me that an in-depth inves tigation of this hypothesis by a team of scientists was needed. Inconsistencies in “Official” Models Finally, and by way of review, we consider the va riations and inconsistencies in the fire/damaged-caused collapse models with time. The earliest model, promoted by various media sources, was that the fires in the towers were suff iciently hot to actually melt the steel in the buildings, thus causing their collapse. For exampl e, Chris Wise in a BBC piece spouted out false notions with great gusto “It was the fire that killed the buildings. There’ s nothing on earth that could survive those temperatures with that amount of fuel burning ... The columns would have melted, the floors would have melted and eventually they wo uld have collapsed one on top of the other.” (quoted in Paul and Hoffman, 2004, p. 25) But as we have seen from later serious studies, mos t of the jet fuel burned out within minutes following impact. And recall the statement of expe rt Dr. Gayle refuting the notion that fires in the WTC buildings were sufficiently hot to melt the steel supports: Your gut reaction would be the jet fuel is what mad e the fire so very intense, a lot of people figured that's what melted the steel. Indeed it did not, the steel did not melt . (Field, 2005; emphasis added) Then we have the model of Bazant and Zhou, which r equires the majority of the 47 huge steel columns on a floor of each Tower to reach sus tained temperatures of 800 o C and buckle (not melt) – at the same time. But as we’ve seen, such temperatures are very difficult to reach while burning office materials, in these connected steel structures where the heat is wicked away by"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 43 September 2006/Volume 3 heat transport. (Paul and Hoffman, 2004, p. 26) An d then to undergo failure at the same time for straight down collapse, well, no, this scenario is far too improbable. That approach was, understandably, abandoned in the next effort, that by FEMA (FEMA, 2002). The FEMA team largely adopted the theory of Dr. Thomas Eagar (Eagar and Musso, 2001), which was also presented in the NOVA present ation “Why the Towers Fell” (NOVA, 2002). Eagar expresses the view that \"the failure of the steel was due to two factors: loss of strength due to the temperature of the fire, and lo ss of structural integrity due to distortion of the steel from the non-uniform temperatures in the fire .\" (Eagar and Musso, 2001) Instead of having the columns fail simultaneously, FEMA has floor pan s in the Towers warp due to fires, and the floor connections to the vertical beams break, and these floor pans then fall down onto the floor pans below, initiating “progressive collapse” or pa ncaking of one floor pan on another. Very simple. But not so fast – what happens to the enor mous core columns to which the floors were firmly attached? Why don’t these remain standing l ike a spindle with the floor pans falling down around them, since the connections are presumed to have broken away? This interconnected steel core is founded on bedrock (Manhattan schist) . FEMA does not totally ignore the core: As the floors collapsed, this left tall freestandin g portions of the exterior wall and possibly central core columns. As the unsupported height of these freestanding exterior wall elements increased [no mention of the huge cen tral core anymore!], they buckled at the bolted column splice connections and also colla psed.” (FEMA. 2002; emphasis added) This approach finally fails to account for the obse rved collapse of the 47 interconnected core columns which are massive and designed to bear the weight of the buildings, and it has the striking weakness of evidently requiring the connec tions of the floor pans to the vertical columns to break, both at the core and at the perimeter col umns, more or less simultaneously. That didn’t work out, so NIST goes back to the drawing board. They require that the connections of the floor pans to vertical columns d o NOT fail (contrary to FEMA’s model), but rather that the floor pans “pull” with enormous for ce, sufficient to cause the perimeter columns to significantly pull in, leading to final failure (contrary to objections of ARUP Fire experts, discussed above). Also, NIST constructs a computer model -- but realistic cases do not actually lead to building collapse. So they “adjust” inputs until the model finally shows collapse initiation for the most severe cases. The details of these “adjustments” are hidden from us, in their computerized hypotheticals, but “the hypothes is is saved.” NIST also has Underwriters Laboratories construct models of the WTC trusses, b ut the models withstand all fires in tests and do NOT collapse. (See above for details.) We are left without a compelling fire/i mpact-damage model, unless one blindly accepts the NIST computer simulation while ignoring the mod el fire-tests, which I’m not willing to do. NIST did not even do the routinely-used visualizati ons to validate their finite-element analysis model (point 13 above). And none of the “official” models outlined above accounts for what happens to the buildings AFTER the building is “poi sed for collapse” (NIST, 2005, p. 142) – namely the rapid and nearly-symmetrical and complet e collapses. Reports of explosions, heard and seen, are not discussed. And they ignore the squibs seen ejected from floors far from where the jets hit – particularly seen in WTC 7 (where no jet hit at all). Finally, what about that molten metal under the rubble piles of all three WTC skysc rapers and the yellow-white hot molten metal seen flowing from the South Tower just prior to its collapse? Remarkably, the controlled demolition h ypothesis accounts for all the available data rather easily. The core columns on lower floors ar e cut using explosives/incendiaries, near-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 44 September 2006/Volume 3 simultaneously, along with cutting charges detonate d up higher so that gravity acting on now- unsupported floors helps bring down the buildings q uickly. The collapses are thus near- symmetrical, rapid and complete, with accompanying squibs -- really very standard stuff for demolition experts. Thermate (whose end product is molten iron) used on some of the steel columns readily accounts for the molten metal which then pooled beneath the rubble piles as well as the sulfidation observed in steel from both the WTC 7 and Towers rubble piles (points 1 and 2 above). I believe this is a straightforward hypothesis, muc h more probable actually than the official hypothesis. It deserves thorough scientif ic scrutiny, beyond that which I have been able to outline in this treatise. Conclusions I have called attention to glaring inadequacies in the “final” reports funded by the US government. I have also presented multiple evidenc es for an alternative hypothesis. In particular, the official theory lacks repeatability in that no actual models or buildings (before or since 9-11-01) have been observed to com pletely collapse due to the proposed fire-based mechanisms. On the other hand, hundreds of buildings have been completely and symmetrically demolished through the use of pre -positioned explosives. And high- temperature chemical reactions can account for the observed large pools of molten metal, under both Towers and WTC 7, and the sulfidation of structural steel. The controlled- demolition hypothesis cannot be dismissed as \"junk science\" because it better satisfies tests of repeatability and parsimony. It ought to be ser iously (scientifically) investigated and debated. A truly independent, cross-disciplinary, internatio nal panel should be formed. Such a panel would consider all viable hypotheses, including the pre-positioned-explosives theory, guided not by politicized notions and constraints, but rather by observations and calculations, to reach a scientific conclusion. If possible it would question, under oath, the officials who approved the rapid removal and destru ction of the WTC steel beams and columns before they could be properly analyzed. None of the government-funded studies h ave provided serious analyses of the explosive demolition hypothesis at all. Until the above steps are taken, the case for accusing ill-trained Muslims of causing all the des truction on 9-11-01 is far from compelling. It just does not add up. And that fact should be of great concern to America ns. (Ryan, 2004). Clearly, we must find out what really caused the WTC skyscrapers to colla pse as they did. The implications of what happened on 9/11/2001 clearly supercede partis an politics. Physics sheds light on the issue which we ignore to our peril as we contemplat e the wars that have been and may yet be justified on the basis of the 9/11 tragedy and i ts \"official\" interpretation. To this end, NIST must release the 6,899 photograph s and over 300 hours of video recordings – acquired mostly by private parties – w hich it admits to holding (NIST, 2005, p. 81). Evidence relating to WTC 7 and its mysteri ous collapse must not be held back. In particular, photos and analyses of the molten metal observed in the basements of both Towers and WTC7 need to be brought forth to the int ernational community of scientists and engineers immediately. Therefore, along with ot hers, I call for the release of these and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 45 September 2006/Volume 3 all relevant data for scrutiny by a cross-disciplin ary, international team of researchers. The explosive-demolition hypothesis will be conside red: all options will be on the table. AFTERWORD In writing this paper, I call for a serious investi gation of the hypothesis that WTC7 and the Twin Towers were brought down, not just by impa ct damage and fires, but through the carefully planned use of explosives/incendiaries. I have presented ample evidence for the controlled-demolition hypothesis, which is scientif ically testable and yet has not been seriously considered in any of the studies funded by the US g overnment. At the same time, I acknowledge that other notions have sprung up in the near vacuum of official consideration of this very plausible hypot hesis. These notions must be subjected to careful scrutiny. I by no means endorse all such id eas. A March 2005 article in Popular Mechanics focuses on poorly-supported claims and pr oceeds to ridicule the whole “9-11 truth movement” (Chertoff, 2005). Serious replies to thi s article have already been written (Hoffman, 2005; Baker, 2005; Meyer, 2005). William Rodriguez has sent important information (p rivate communications, November 2005) which I append in closing:  \"Thank you so much for coming o ut with a report questioning the \"official Story\" of 9/11. I read with a lot of dedication you r paper and I distributed it widely to all the Victims and survivors of that day (I am the lea der of the families and the last person pulled from the rubble from the North Tower). You are just missing my experience. I told the 9/11 Commission about the explosions and the events on the sub-basement on that day. They di d not put it in the final report. Please check the internet under \"William Rodriguez 9/11\". I am trying to raise the same questions. Since I am a respected figure internatio nally, I noticed how my testimony has been presented unedited all over the world. But in the USA, I am edited and even though I have a lot of respect from the media, I am asked constantly about other subjects and issues but nothing about the explosions of that day . Congratulations from the side of the really affected on that day. Keep up your investiga tions. William Rodriguez Hispanic Victims Group, 9/11 Un ited Services Group, Lower Manhattan Family Advisory Counsel I thanked Mr. Rodriguez and asked him how he could say the explosion came from the sub- basement below him, rather than far above (where th e plane hit), also regarding the timing of the explosions. He replied: About my experience. My basis was, like I told the Commission, there was an explosion that came from under our feet, we were pushed upwar ds lightly by the effect, I was on basement level 1 and it sounded that it came from B 2 and B3 level. Rapidly after that we heard the impact far away at the top. My assertions are [that] my 20 years experience there and witnessing prior to that many other noise s [enable me] to conclude without any doubt where the sounds were coming from. 2ND- Some of the same people that I saved gave testimonies in interviews of the same experien ce prior to my actually being reunited with them after the event!!! Like I explained, some of these survivors stories were told in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Journal of 9/11 Studies 46 September 2006/Volume 3 countless [interviews] of coverage, but in SPANISH! ! I have the actual recordings available of some of the Television Specials that f eatured our stories. Mr. Rodriguez worked for years in the building and his perception of sounds cannot be overlooked. He is a reliable witness. Above (and elsewhere) he records that the explosion in the sub-basement was followed “rapidly after that” by t he sound of an impact far above. This assertion is remarkable for it strongly suggests th at the colliding plane or its fuel could not have caused the (earlier) explosion in the sub-basement. William Rodriguez and other witnesses may shed additional light on the explosions in the Towe rs on 9/11/2001.
