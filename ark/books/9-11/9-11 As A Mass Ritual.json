There is, among conspiracy afficionadoes, a kind of brotherhood. (I use the gender-specific term “brotherhood” deliberately.) It is a brotherhood buried alive. What does that mean? Imagine a person buried alive. Imagine yourself. You are equal parts alive and dead. You are in your own tomb; you feel the sensations of mor - tality with a keenness you never did before. Death approaches. Or maybe it h as already arrived and you just don’t know it yet. Edgar Allen Poe wrote about it. More importantly, such premature burial is an essential part of the Ma - sonic initiation ceremony of the third degree. To be ritually and symboli - cally slain, buried, and raised again is a feature of many initiatory programs a round the world, from Siberian shamanism to quaint nineteenth century English secret societies. It is a liminal event: you are on the threshold of living and dying, and in that sacred spot you can see in both directions. Conspiracy theorists are kind of like that. They have one foot in the world of mainstream history and culture, what Robert Anton Wilson used to call “consensus reality.” That’s the world where most of us live. We are all products of that world, and of the ideas and worldview it represents. We are trained in this world virtually from birth: school, church, government, me - dia all conspire to present an image—a picture—of reality that will result in the de velopment of perfect citizens in an easily-managed society. There is a social contract: we contribute to this society with the expectation that we will receive goods and services in return. We obey the laws that are cre- ated by other people, believing that our best interests are being addressed the reby. We fight in wars declared by our governments in order to preserve our society: this carefully-structured, albeit artificial, society. And all is right with the world."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"vi Top Myri Dghtpaynr Byyl sh iop Wyaev But conspiracy theorists have their other foot ... well, somewhere else. Not everyone is asleep to the darker mechanisms of reality. In fact, every - one becomes aware of them at some point in their lives. Everyone ques - tions. The very nature of reality itself is at times so hostile to human life th at human institutions must be challenged for their inadequate protection of their constituents. Conspiracy theorists seize on this inadequacy as ev - idence of the tenuousness of consensus reality. There are other forces at w ork, forces that are unacknowledged by the state, the church, the media because to admit their existence is to admit failure. Thus, when things go wrong terrorists are blamed, or communists, or witches. This serves to rally the citizens around the government once again, instead of stopping to in - sist that explanations be given, that evidence is properly analyzed, that the g uilty are apprehended and punished. And we once more go to war, against ... someone, somewhere. Paranoia becomes institutionalized. It is appropriated by the govern- ment as its own prerogative. The state determines the nature and quality of the p aranoia: it creates intelligence agencies whose sole purpose is to give a form to paranoia, to enshrine paranoia as one of the necessary qualities of an observant and caring state. To prove that paranoia is an acceptable characterisic of the paternalistic regime. The citizens are not allowed to become paranoid unless it is at gov - ernment direction and sanction. Individual cases of paranoia are frowned u pon. The state tells us that if we are not paranoid the way it is paranoid— and about the same things—it’s because we don’t have all the facts: about terrorism, fundamentalism, communism, foreign countries, weapons of mass destruction, sleeper cells. The state has all the facts: classified doc - uments, wire-tap transcripts, intelligence feeds, high-altitude reconnais - sance images, none of which the citizen is permitted to see. I t does not realize that the logical conclusion of all this paranoia is sus - picion of the state apparatus itself. W hat the conspiracy theorist often fails to realize, however, is that those working for the state are often just as clueless as the average citizen when it comes to the origin and function of the forces at work to subvert it. The strength of a conspiracy, after all, rests in the limited number of per - sons who are aware of its existence and parameters. No one has the entire p icture. Each member of the state apparatus only has possession of a sin - gle piece of an enormous jigsaw puzzle. Putting together all these disparate p ieces—particularly when one does not have the original picture to work from—is a soul-destroying enterprise that consumes decades of work and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"vii Popyprig years of one’s life. This is especially true when the state has in its arsenal of lies the techniques of disinformation and misdirection, of false testimony and planted documents. Anyone who works with this material eventually comes to that realiza - tion. But the motivation to keep digging is still alive; the urge to uncover one mor e piece of the puzzle, one more document, is perhaps a central characteristic not only of the conspiracy theorist but of human nature it - self. The more intelligent of the theorists soon come to realize that Hansel a nd Gretel have left breadcrumbs everywhere, in no discernible pattern. Thus, the inclination among some of the best to stop looking for the chil - dren and start looking for the Witch. The deeper one delves into the conspiracy literature, the more one is struck by the tendency of some theorists to look beyond the documents and the tan- gible evidence of government malfeasance or political conspiracy to more transcendental sources of power. One begins with the government agents, the spies, the politicians, the military and soon gravitates towards the secret societ - ies: the Freemasons and the Illuminati (among so many others). This involves studying their texts, their social structures, their stated goals, their secret con- claves, their antinomian beliefs and practices. One comes face to face with the Occult. A strange journey, indeed, from a presidential assassination to an inter - view with the Devil. Y et, once one has made the leap from BU-Files and documents stamped LIMDIS and NOFORN to grimoires and magical diaries, it all seems to hang together... for awhile. New sources of evidence become available. New testimony appears. Weird cults are seen linked to secret government machinations. George Washington was a Freemason. So was Simon Boli - var. And Gerald Ford. What does it mean? I t would take a 21 st century Kabbalist to figure it out. Someone with knowledge of codes and decoding. Someone like the author of this book, S.K. Bain. Someone who was observant enough to notice the details most of us ignore, since we have not been trained that way. Since we have not done the reading. It needs someone who is as versed in Kabbalah as in conspiracy, in ge - matria as in government. It requires a new science, a new art, a new ap - proach to the old material. Furthermore, it requires a sense that conspir - acy may be transcendental, may have its origins in the unconscious mind of the s tate. The numerology alone is significant: someone, somewhere is pulling these particular quantum strings.

They are either the result of a conscious and deliberate series of acts by agents so powerful and so unknown that a belief in an ultimate Secret Society is our only option, or they are evidence of the workings of an even Darker Force ... and no one is in charge. This is where S.K. Bain comes in. He notices things. He sees patterns in the dates, names, places, and documents that most of us either ignore or can’t see on our best days. I have stayed away from 9/11 conspiracy theo - rizing since there are already a lot of people doing that and I have nothing of v alue to add to the conversation. That is not true of S.K. Bain. What the author adds to the ongoing dialogue about 9/11 transcends the hideous events of that day and extends into other times, other spaces. This is new material, a new approach to the conspiracies and cover-ups that surround the day that—in the view of the mainstream media—“changed everything” (although many of us know better, know that nothing had changed, know that it was the twentieth century taken to its logical conclusion). What is more, Bain develops his thesis with a rare sense of humor and style. This is not merely another angry diatribe about government com - plicity and corruption. This is not the work of a man who sees reptiles in h uman form, or Jewish-Masonic plots hatched in Czech cemeteries. Bain doesn’t scream at you. He doesn’t try to shout you down. Instead, his prose is written with a sense of astonished discovery that invites us in, to share in his startled and startling conclusions. Bain may very well be the 21 st century Kabbalist we have been waiting for, and this— The Most Dangerous Book in the World —may prove to be his Sepher Yetzirah , his Zohar , his Liber 777 . As someone who writes about the link between magic and politics, be - tween ritual and conspiracy, I can recommend this text for its revolutionary a pproach to the central political event of our recent history. Many times during reading I found myself thinking of other connections, other links to earlier events, all suggested by Bain’s Kabbalah. Whether or not you believe in a con- spiracy surrounding 9/11 is not really important. The nature of Bain’s argument i s such that you will find your mind expanded by the new possibilities, the ar - cane potentialities lurking behind political and historical events. By choosing t o see 9/11 as a ritual on a massive scale, we paradoxically may better be able to understand it, to accommodate it’s message on a psychological—even spiritu - al—level as we approach the end of 2012 and the birth of a new aeon. Y ou may be mystified by Bain’s work. You may be frustrated, exalted, annoyed, confused, even relieved ...but you will not be bored.

Which ones have possible merit? Which ones sound plausible, but have in fact been effectively debunked? From the patently false statement that “nobody imagined that terrorists would use planes as weapons,” to suspicious insider trading in the weeks and days leading up to 9/11; from the inordinate number of military drills taking place on 9/11 (and a much-delayed response from the Air Force), to the un- heeded warnings from multiple nations regarding suspiciously high levels of terrorist activity leading up to the event; from Bush family members in key positions in corporations responsible for providing security to the World Trade Center and Dulles Airport, to documented instances of the FBI failing to follow up on field agents’ warnings—there are in fact so many suspicious circumstances, unexplained anomalies, misleading statements (official and otherwise), and outright fabrications surrounding 9/11 (the detailed chroni - cling of which is far beyond the scope of this work) that it is easy to understand why a veritable 9/11-Conspiracy-Theory cottage industry has developed over the last ten-plus years. “Set Up to Fail” M illions of Americans—and concerned citizens around the globe—have serious questions about the events of 9/11, and why shouldn’t they, when even the individuals in charge of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, a.k.a. the 9/11 Commission, have no confi - dence in the process or its outcome, The 9/11 Commission Report ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2 Top Myri Dghtpaynr Byyl sh iop Wyaev Thomas Kean, former Republican Gover - nor of New Jersey, was the Commission Chair - man, and Lee H. Hamilton, former Democratic U.S. Representative from the 9 th District of In- diana, was its Vice-Chairman. Months after the commission issued its re- port and ceased functioning, Chairman Kean and other commissioners toured the country to draw attention to their recommendations, claiming that some of their findings and sug - gestions were being ignored. Co-chairs Kean and Hamilton subsequently co-authored a book about the constraints they faced as com- missioners, entitled Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission . Released in 2006, the book chronicles their work, and in it, they charge that the 9/11 Commission was “set up to fail,” writing that the commission became so frustrated with repeated misstatements by Pentagon and Federal Aviation Administration officials during the course of the investigation that it considered a separate investigation into possible obstruction of justice by these officials. John Farmer, Jr., senior counsel to the Commission, stated that the Com- mission “discovered that...what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when—was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.” Farmer continues: “At some level of the government, at some point in time... there was a decision not to tell the truth about what happened.... The (NORAD) tapes told a rad- ically different story from what had been told to us and the public.” Commis - sion head Kean concurred: “We to this day don’t know why NORAD told us what they told us, it was just so far from the truth.” 1 More Questions Than Answers F ormer high-level officials have made serious allegations concerning the in- volvement of elements within U.S. intelligence agencies. Richard Clarke, who was the White House counter-terrorism czar at the time of the attacks, has accused the CIA of deliberately suppressing informa - tion before 9/11, information that might have prevented the attacks. Clarke claimed: “There was a high-level decision in the CIA ordering people not to share information.” And who made this decision? “I would think it would have been made by the director (George Tenet).” 2 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3 Iopyrighptro Similar accusations have been leveled at federal law enforcement. Ac - cording to various sources, no fewer than 14 countries attempted to warn the U .S. about the impending attacks, to no avail. Then there’s Robert Wright, the top bin Laden financial tracker at the FBI’s Chicago office, who through tears of frustration and anger told a National Press Club audience, “The FBI allowed 9/11 to happen.” Come again? “FBI management intentionally and repeatedly thwarted and obstructed my investigations into Middle Eastern terrorist financing.” 3 And what could explain the lack of an effective response by the military, the Air Force, in particular, on 9/11? According to Webster Griffin Tarpley, the morning of September 11 saw “the greatest density of drills in US mili - tary history.” With names like ‘Vigilant Guardian’, there were reportedly up to 46 military exercises taking place—some involving scenarios uncannily similar to the actual events that would unfold that day (a happenstance that would be repeated in the London 7/7 bombings)—which diverted resourc - es, manpower and attention away from the real threats and resulted in under - standably considerable levels of confusion as the actual attacks unfolded. 4 A range of foreign officials have also questioned the official government version of the events of 9/11. Andreas von Bülow, a Social Democratic Party member of the Ger - man parliament from 1969 to 1994, was on the parliamentary committee on in telligence services, a group that has access to classified information. Von Bülow was also a member of the Schalck-Golodkowski investigation committee which investigates white-collar crime. He has estimated that in - side trader profits surrounding 9/11 totaled approximately $15 billion. Von B ülow told The Daily Telegraph “If what I say is right, the whole US govern - ment should end up behind bars.” Further, he said, “They have hidden be- hind a veil of secrecy and destroyed the evidence...they invented the story of 19 M uslims working within Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda in order to hide the truth of their own covert operation.” He also said, “I’m convinced that the US apparatus must have played a role and my theory is backed up by the [Washington] government’s refusal to present any proof whatsoever of what happened.” 5 With domestic intelligence, defense, and law enforcement agencies like these, who the hell needs foreign enemies? Well, one could rightly point out that these agencies do —and one might also point to volumes of evidence that they go to great lengths to ensure the existence of aggressive, well-motivated and sufficiently-funded adversaries...all the better to justify their enormous budgets and scare the pants off the civilian population."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 Top Myri Dghtpaynr Byyl sh iop Wyaev Is it even possible to determine if there were indeed conspirators within our own government, and, if so, their identities? Repeated calls for a new offi - cial investigation have been ignored—not that anyone should expect to have any more confidence in the results of a new investigation than the original one. Is there, then, a path on which to proceed, an explanatory framework that can help us make sense of all this? Psych Warfare W hat if the ongoing confusion surrounding 9/11, and the persistent lack of clarity ten years on, is not the residual result of the “fog of war,” but rather compelling evidence of something altogether different—psychological warfare. The U.S. Department of Defense defines psychological warfare as “the planned use of propaganda and other psychological actions having the prima - ry purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups in such a way as to support the achievement of national objectives.” However, psychological warfare tactics can be employed by any adversary against any opponent or intended target, including a domestic pop - ulation, for instance. Such as in Orwell’s dystopian novel, 1984 . In their article “9/11, Psychological Warfare & the American Narrative,” authors Elizabeth Gould and Paul Fitzgerald write that “the state’s use of psy - chological warfare to bend the population to war is as old, if not older than the existence of states themselves.” They continue, “But it was perhaps Nazi Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering whose statement while on trial at Nurem- berg best summed up the cynical simplicity of the logic: Of course people don’t want war. But after all, it’s the leaders of the coun- try who determine the policy and it’s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it’s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parlia - ment, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders, that is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to greater danger. Gould and Fitzgerald explain that “psychological warfare in the form of propaganda comes in all shapes and sizes as well as shades of black, grey or white.” The United States government’s coordinated use of psychological war - fare on its own citizens “began in earnest during World War II and ever since has grown and expanded into public relations, advertising, cinema, radio and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"5 Iopyrighptro television, electronic video games and now social media. Its pro-war booster - ism extends over sports, religion, education, news and entertainment (and of course the military) to form a seamless electronic cocoon-like web.” Gould and Fitzgerald conclude that psych warfare “is employed on an ever growing list of those deemed as enemies of America as well as on a confused and agitated American public—whose corporate news networks frame and manage an increasingly shallow narrative while engaging in a kind of Orwellian Kabuki Theatre of fairness and balance.” Could this be an accurate assessment of what is taking place within our country, and, if so, does it help explain what happened on 9/11? In his book, Psychological Warfare and the New World Order , Servando Gonza - lez confirms this suspicion, describing “a long, protracted war against the American people. It is not a convention- al war waged with tanks, battleships and planes in con- ventional battlefields—at least not yet.” Gonzalez con- tinues, “It is a secret, insidious type of war whose main battleground is the people’s minds. Its main weapons are propaganda and mass brainwashing mostly by using dis - information, deception, and lies in a large scale not used against the people of a nation since the end of Nazi Ger - many. Though important, those elements are just part of a series of carefully planned and executed long- and short- term psychological warfare operations. In synthesis, it is a psychological war.” A 9/11 Black Op? 9 /11 is often referred to by conspiracy theorists as a “false flag” operation, which are covert operations designed to deceive a target population in such a way that it appears as though the action is being carried out by an entity other than the one actually responsible. False flag operations are not limited to war and counter-insurgency operations, but are also used in peace-time. 6 F alse flag events are a type of black operation (op, for short), a covert action typically involving activities that are highly clandestine and often out - side of standard military protocol or even against the law. Black ops missions often fit into the plausible deniability category, in which there is no claim of responsibility for the action, and/or a false flag operation is used to give the appearance that another actor was responsible. Black ops frequently involve extensive arrangements so as to be able to hide the fact that the black opera - tion ever occurred."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 Top Myri Dghtpaynr Byyl sh iop Wyaev The methods used in black operations are also used in unconventional warfare, in which civilian populations and political parties are targeted di - rectly. Black ops may include such things as assassination, sabotage, extor - tion, spying on allied countries or one’s own citizens, kidnapping, support - ing resistance movements, torture, use of fraud to obtain funds, use of child soldiers, human experimentation, trafficking in contraband items, as well as false flag operations. 7 It certainly seems that false flag or black op, or both, might be an apt de- scription of what occurred on 9/11, and that this could well have been part of a broader domestically-focused psychological warfare campaign. But, if true, this raises more questions than it answers. Something Worse? W hat if the many conflicting official accounts surrounding the events of September 11, 2001, are not just bureaucratic incompetence, or mis - takes made under intense media pressure to produce information quickly, but part of a deliberately designed campaign in which obfuscation, misinformation and disinformation play key roles in deceiving and manipulating the public? We are bombarded with such volumes of conflicting information that our ability to meaningfully process it is overwhelmed. Out of necessity, we give up trying to figure it out. Self-preservation kicks in and we shut down before we blow a fuse. There are so many things that just don’t add up, that don’t make sense and are genuinely suspicious, and the lack of any real answers on so many fronts after such an extended period of time might in itself be viewed as evi - dence of an active and ongoing conspiracy. Was 9/11 a black op on the American public by their own government, or rogue elements from within? If so, what were the objectives? To build public support for going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan? Was the U.S. government/ military manipulated or “hijacked” by extremely sophisticated and powerful international actors? What if the above were all true, but this wasn’t even the half of it? What if the truth were even more disturbing? Strong Evidence of a 9/11 Conspiracy T here is an aspect of 9/11 that has largely gone unexplored, and been com- pletely ignored by the mainstream media. It represents a new avenue of investigation, one that has the potential to produce conclusive evidence of the existence of a conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"7 Iopyrighptro Many conspiracy theories have been effectively debunked, while others have seen experts weigh in on both sides of the issue with equal effectiveness and remain an open question—leaving the general public with a sense of un- ease but precious few hard answers to allay their fears or confirm their suspi - cions one way or the other. What would hard evidence of a 9/11 conspiracy look like? If such exists, it would have explosive potential, the power to ignite a furor among 9/11 Truth groups at home and abroad, and among the public at large. Many people al - ready suspect foul play on 9/11, but they don’t feel they have proof conclusive enough to warrant action. Others do believe conclusive proof already exists, and new hard evidence would further radicalize their attitudes. Conclusive proof of a 9/11 conspiracy could possess the ability to ignite a global firestorm, to generate unimaginable levels of public distrust of govern- ment, to incite civil unrest and calls for revolution. A Reconstructed Occult Script A n as yet unexplored avenue of investigation does in fact exist. 9/11 wasn’t simply a black op; it was that, and more. Highly compel - ling evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the perpetrators of this massive criminal act not only employed a broad range of sophisticated psycho - logical warfare tactics but, even more disturbingly, incorporated a wide variety of occult symbols and other esoteric elements into multiple levels of the event. This implies the ability to manipulate, to control, on such an enormous scale that it is beyond what most people are prepared to accept. It so strongly conflicts with our perception of reality that we dare not even contemplate it. Unfortunately the evidence points to a worst-case scenario. In a re- al-life CSI-meets-Dan-Brown, the picture that emerges is that of 9/11 as an ultra-powerful mind-control and propaganda weapon—a psychological warfare tool of enormous proportions—infused with techno-sorcery and deep-level occult programming. 9/11 was a global MegaRitual, and the painstakingly reconstructed occult script for the event contained herein con- vincingly shows this. We instinctively reject such conclusions, even if they are supported by solid evidence. However, we must have the courage to let the evidence tell the story, because, as the reader will learn, what is at stake is not simply our view of reality. Whether or not our worldview is challenged, or shattered, by the revelations in this material, doesn’t change the truth of the matter, which is that the conspiracy that generated 9/11 is real, that it is ongoing—and that September 11, 2001, was just a prelude to what they have planned for 2012/2013."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8 Top Myri Dghtpaynr Byyl sh iop Wyaev What to Expect A s serious a topic as this is, however, don’t expect a dry, academic discourse in the pages that follow.

Leav - ing aside whether or not Bush actually saw the impact when and where he claimed (before entering a Florida classroom), how could anyone viewing footage of the incident have concluded—again, as Bush himself claimed to have said—“It must have been a horrible accident.” Bush, a former Texas Air National Guard pilot, was no Top Gun (actually he went AWOL), but even he, upon viewing footage of a jetliner flying directly into a skyscraper in perfectly clear skies, could not have possibly thought that it was the result of pilot error.

These individuals were not Muslim extremists, not motivated by ha - tred for the “Great Satan,” but paradoxically by a love for Satan himself. Independent researchers and conspiracy theorists would later question whether or not those flights were even scheduled on 9/11, whether they were in fact the planes that struck the towers, whether they ever took off, whether they were in the air long after supposedly crashing into the towers ... a swirling stew of unending theories about fake passenger manifests, remote-controlled drones, fictitious passengers, still-living hijackers, and on and on.

Powerful numbers and symbols played key roles in this global ceremony. Co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, William Wynn Westcott (1848-1925), writes, “The followers of Pythagoras ... referred every object, planet, man, idea and essence to some number or other, in a way, which to most moderns Symbol Illiteracy I n an insightful piece entitled “Symbolic Literacy,” author Michael Tsarion observes that we suffer from “chronic symbol illiteracy” and are subjected to subliminal and subtextual persuasion that constitutes what he refers to as a psychic dictatorship. This dictatorship, Tsarion says, “involves the deliberate and subversive manipulation and public purveyance of words, images, numbers, colors, rhythms, and symbols which are subsequently directed, via ubiquitous media oracles, toward the limbic areas of the human brain,” which, he continues, “produces an elaborate and insidious cryptic language specifically designed to stimulate conflict between fantasy and reality.” Tsarion rightly believes that we will remain subject to mass manipulation until we “be - come lucidly cognizant and profoundly educated concerning the power of symbols, not only as transcendental portals, or mathematical devices, but as weapons in the hands of plutocratic elites, with occult agendas, laboring to arrest the mental, emotional, and spiritual maturation of the underclasses.” “Subliminal messages,” writes Tsarion, “permeate television programs, computer games, mag - azines, billboards, products, and musical productions,” foisted upon us by “technological witch - doctors and cyber-space sorcerers.” He continues, “Their particular concoction of spells are cast via t echniques that go by names such as Tele-hypnosis, Metacontrast, Hemisync, Synaesthenia, and Embedding . New techniques, yes, but with the same deadly effect as any past voodoo, sorcery, or telepathy.” Tsarion also reminds us of the high stakes: Cynics who continue to doubt whether symbols and images have any lasting negative affect on consciousness should remember and study the most recent example of mass control, that of Nazi Germany. The Nazis openly used ritual choreography, ancient symbols and rallying chants, powerful mystical logos and regalia, and so on, to force men into a hive mentality. We now know that Hitler and his cronies were deeply involved with powerful occult societies and were fascinated by ancient mysticism. Hitler sent agents throughout the world, to visit tribes and sects in order to procure occult works and doctrines, and to learn how to employ magical arts.

Of the number 11, William Wynn Westcott writes, “This seems to have been the type of a number with an evil reputation among all peoples.

The Twin Towers were not only mod - ern concrete-and-steel re-creations of the famed Pillars of Hermes, but also symbolically marked the boundary between this realm and the next—between our world and that of the dead. Associated with the crossing of boundaries, Hermes, also the god of doorways, was a fitting psychopomp, or conductor of the dead to the Underworld, as he was known—a role that was certainly invoked on 9/11. Homer and Hesiod portrayed Hermes as the author of skilled or deceptive acts; in the Iliad, he was said to be “excellent in all the tricks.” The Homer - ic hymn to Hermes invokes him as the one “of many shifts (polytropos), blandly cunning, a robber...a thief at the gates.” Among the functions commonly linked to him in Greek literature are intrigues and covert rea- sons, fraud and perjury, wit and ambiguity. Thus he was a patron of speak - ers, heralds, ambassadors and diplomats, messengers and thieves. In mythology, and in the study of folklore and religion, a trickster is a god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who plays tricks or otherwise disobeys normal rules and conventional behavior. 2 According to prominent folklorist Yeleazar Meletinsky, Hermes is a deified trickster. 3 A Gateway W hether as the god of commerce, the psychopomp, or deified trickster, multiple aspects of Hermes’ character were invoked on 9/11 by those conducting the ceremony, and the destruction of these modern representa - tions of the fabled Pillars of Hermes, signified—fittingly for the god of door - ways—the opening of a metaphysical doorway. The Twin Towers, and the space between them, represented a gateway and their destruction signified the rending of the barrier between worlds, the sym- bolic tearing of the Veil of Isis—creating a portal, unveiling the Holy of Holies. The idea of the Twin Towers as gateways further links to the Zodiacal sign of Gemini, the Twins, and its position as a celestial/heavenly gateway (see page 83 for additional discussion on this topic), a prime example of the key princi - ple of “As Above, So Below.”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"23 P—ttTh ft—— The Two Pillars of Freemasonry, Sacrificial Altars N ot to be ignored is the tradition of the Freemasons in regard to the two pillars, which are a prominent emblem of their Craft. They represent the pillars Jachin and Boaz, which Hiram of Tyre made for Solomon, and set one on either side of the entrance to the Temple, to commemorate the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night which guided the Israelites in their forty years’ wanderings in the wil - derness. 4 Thus, the Twin Towers not only represented the Pillars of Hermes, but also evoked the Freemasons’ Jachin and Boaz. Beyond what they represented, however, is what the towers became on 9/11—altars, massive sacrificial altars, for sacrifice by fire. “The Number of Magick in Itself” B efore moving on to interpret Scene Two, there is one other occult authority we must meet, one who consid - ered the number 11 as “the number of Magick in itself...

In his best known writing, entitled The Book of the Law , Crowley states “My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us.” (Crowley used the spelling “magick” to distinguish ceremo - nial magic from ordinary sleight-of-hand trickery.) The repeated use of the number 11 (and it will make further appearances throughout the script), then, not only characterized the nature of the act, but also signaled the commencement of a magical operation. “The Wickedest Man in the World” “I was not content to believe in a personal devil and serve him, in the ordinary sense of the word,” Aleister Crowley once said about Satan. “I wanted to get hold of him personally and become his chief of staff.” Born Edward Alexander Crowley, Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), also known as both “Frater Perdurabo” and “The Great Beast,” was an influential English occultist,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24 T—tt MTh ft Dfifffltt\u0017Th\u0016 BThTh\u0015 \u0014ff ft—tt WTh\u0017\u0013\u0012 astrologer, mystic, poet and cere- monial magician, responsible for founding the religious philoso - phy of Thelema. In this latter role, Crowley came to see himself as a prophet entrusted with informing humanity that it was entering the new Aeon of Horus. Born into a wealthy upper-class family, as a young man he became an influential member of the eso - teric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Subsequently believ - ing that he was being contacted by his Holy Guardian Angel, an en - tity known as Aiwass, while staying in Egypt in 1904, he “received” a text known as The Book of the Law from what he be- lieved was a di - vine source, and around which he would come to develop his new philosophy of Thelema. He would go on to found his own occult society, the A:.A:., and eventually rose to be- come a leader of Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), before founding a reli - gious commune in Cefalù known as the Abbey of Thelema, which he led from 1920 through 1923. After being evicted from Cefalù he returned to Britain, where he continued to promote Thelema until his death. Crowley was a bisexual, a recreational drug experimenter and a social critic. In many of these roles he was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time, espousing a form of libertinism based upon the rule of “Do What Thou Wilt.” Because of this, he gained widespread notoriety Aleister Crowley, proponent of a New World Order To the eyes of a god, mankind must appear as a species of bacteria which multiply and become progressively virulent whenever they find themselves in a congenial culture, and whose activity diminishes until they disappear completely as soon as proper measures are taken to sterilize them. —Aleister Crowley Crowley’s vision of a New Aeon coincides with the Il- luminati’s age-old plan for a secular world order ruled by an enlightened elite. The wording might be different, but the hermetic philosoph- ical background is the same. Crowley and the Establish- ment see eye-to-eye on the subject—and this eye is the Eye of Horus. 1 Author William Ramsey observed that Crowley “wrote numerous books detailing his vision of the ideal society: the strong over the weak, the maintenance of a patriarchal aris- tocracy ruling over a slave state, and the Dar - winian killing of the unfit. According to the Great Beast, a small elite must rule over the masses: ‘You will observe that I am advocat - ing an aristocratic revolution.

A Cambridge-educated world traveler, Crowley associated with the artistic and cultural luminaries of his era, including such noted figures as Ernest Hemingway, W. B. Yeats and H. L. Mencken. 5 References to him can be found in the works of numerous writers, musi - cians and filmmakers, and he has also been cited as a key influence on many later esoteric groups and individuals. 6 Today, Crowley is regarded as either a misunderstood mystical genius or a depraved charlatan, a proph- et for an era of spiritual enlightenment or a Satanic harbinger of the Anti-Christ, an agent for the sexual liberation of mankind or drug-addicted pederast. As a youth, Crowley wished to become a celebrity and to change the course of history and, in his own way, he accomplished both objectives. Not only did his peculiar character make him something of a cult icon, his philosophic and esoteric works are today a major force influencing mainstream culture, values and spirituality. Unlike most historical figures who lose their relevancy as the years go by, Crowley’s influence is steadily increasing in the 21st century. This is not only a re - sult of luck or natural evolution, however. C rowley and his OTO maintained ties with high-level members of the British and American governments, as well as with influential figures in science, law and culture. The world’s elite, predominated by Illuminist values, are in perfect accord with Crowley’s Thelema. These connec - tions facilitated the dissemination and a cceptance of his works in popular culture. Crowley not only predicted so - ciety’s abandonment of traditional religions and the embrace of the Aeon of H orus, he was part of the motor that made these changes happen. 7 Excerpt from Hymn to Pan by Aleister Crowley Goat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god, Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.

Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, and by his own account (on two sepa - rate occasions, no less) says he sees Flight 11 hurtle through clear skies, slam into the North Tower and then remarks, “There’s one terrible pilot.” Minutes later, Bush sits before a group of predominantly Afri - can-American second-grade school children listening to a recita - tion of The Pet Goat , when Chief of Staff Andrew Card whispers in his ear, “A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.” Bush continues to sit in front of the class listening to the reading for an additional seven minutes. Fair Enough A ndrew Card’s recollection of the sequence of events that morning varies from Bush’s. He recalls a National Security Council staffer telling him- self and the president, “Sir, it appears there’s been a small twin-engine plane crashed into one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City.” If this version of events is accurate, and Bush did not in fact see the crash of the first plane on television before entering the classroom, this would explain why he initially assumed pilot error (but not why he failed to accurately recall the cor - rect sequence of events on two separate occasions or subsequently clarify the issue for posterity).

Fair enough. But why did Bush sit there for a full seven minutes after being told that “America is under attack”? He would later claim in his own book that he didn’t want to alarm the children by getting up abruptly during their reading. A bit weak, but fair enough. In the end, however, these may be about the only things concerning Bush’s presence in Sarasota that fateful day which can potentially be explained away. The Pet Goat Black Mass in Paradise Let him say: “I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me with deeper devotion to Him.” Aleister Crowley, Liber 175 W hen Anton Szandor LaVey published his Satan - ic Bible in 1969, he wrote that: “A black mass is essentially a parody on the religious service of the Ro - man Catholic Church, but can be loosely applied to a satire on any religious ceremo - ny.” He went on in Satanic Rituals (1972) to present it as the most representatively satanic ritual in the book. 1 A s atirical ceremony, a Commander-in-Chief that wouldn’t leave his seat until the reading of a story about a pet goat was completed (“ I read this book that I may study the nature of my Deity ”), during which time hundreds of his fellow Americans were in harm’s way, many of them meet - ing horrific ends as they burned alive or plunged to their deaths from the towers (“ Yet also may he deliberately practise cruelties ”)—conjuring the image of The Tower tarot card (variously referred to as “the Devil’s house,” “the house of the damned” and “Inferno,” or “Hell”)—all taking place in ... “Paradise,” the city of Sarasota’s unofficial yet widely-used and acknowl - edged nickname. Well, how about that?"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"31 T—ff PffTh GttfiTh Paradise Lost O f course, the reference here is not to the Biblical paradise of heaven, and not simply to the Devil’s paradise, Hell, although that is certainly part of it. There is a more serious occult-philosophical point they’re aiming at: that of a Man-made/Masonic Par - adise, their version of paradise on earth, created by them, ruled by them, and not-altogether too differ - ent from hell for the masses who have to live there. This speaks to the heart of their enterprise, “perfecting creation”: taking God’s imperfect cre- ation and, through their human wisdom bringing it into a state of perfection. Historian John Michell states: “...it is their immediate concern, having eat - en of the tree of knowledge, to apply all their new - ly acquired arts to constructing a facsimile of the Garden, a model paradise.” Echoing this, Michael Hoffman writes in his book Secret Societies and Psycho- logical Warfare (the subject of Chapter Six), “If Chronos-Saturn destroyed a divine Eden, Saturn being the force of time, decay and the progress of matter... man will recreate a true Theleme, a better Eden than God. And that, in sum, is the masonic cover story that maintains cachet to this day.” Serious stuff for a parody, you may be thinking. True, and unfortunately there’s more weighty discussion ahead, because although a black mass may be a satire on a religious ceremony, the underlying precepts are deadly serious, and in this context a story about a pet goat is no laughing matter. Get Your Goat A ccording to a research monograph on the Dionysian Artificers and Early Masonry edited by mystic Manly P. Hall, the symbolism of the goat relates to the pre-Christian God Pan, Dionysius. Pan is represented as being half-human, half-goat with horns, and would later be used in me- dieval times to represent the devil. 2 The Go at of Mendes, or Baphomet, is a goat-headed deity, being formed of both male and female principles, with Mer - cury’s Caduceus for its phallus.

This is not the Christian devil but a symbol of the ancient alchemists representing the fact that nature and nature’s God is a com- bination and balance of male and female forces, light and darkness, moisture and dryness. The very principle of Hermes Trismegitus, “As Above, So Below,” is symbolized by Baphomet. 3 S ince 1855, the name Baphomet has been associ - ated with a “Sabbatic Goat” image drawn by Eliphas Lévi. Lévi called his image “The Goat of Mendes,” pre- sumably following Herodotus’ account that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was de- picted with a goat’s face and legs. 4 The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of Thele- ma, the mystical system estab - lished by Aleister Crowley in the early twentieth century. In Magick (Book 4) , Crowley assert - ed that Baphomet was a divine androgyne and “the hi - eroglyph of arcane perfection”: This serpent, SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade ‘Know Thyself !’ and taught Initiation. He is ‘The Devil’ of the Book of Thoth , and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane per - fection... He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreover his letter is ayin, the Eye, so that he is Light; and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty. 5 A Child’s Guide to the Luciferian Doctrine O stensibly a children’s story about a girl and her goat, The Pet Goat was in reality a strategically employed device used to introduce this key occult element into the 9/11 MegaRitual; yet, it is more than this. A deeper reading of the text reveals that this children’s story is an allegory of the Luciferian Doc - trine: The Father is an overbearing hyper-authoritarian, and the goat—whose initial poor behavior is, in broader context, relatively benign—saves the day.

It is Lucifer, the light-bearer, who seeks to set humanity free. Luciferianism constitutes the nucleus of the ruling class religion and represents a radical reevaluation of humanity’s ageless adver - sary: Satan. It is the ultimate inversion of good and evil: Luciferian mythology carica - tures Jehovah as an oppressive tyrant; Satan, who retains his heavenly title of Lucifer, is the liberator of humanity. Masonry, which acts as the contemporary retainer for the ancient Mystery religion, reconceptualizes Satan in a similar fashion.

The teacher pounded out the syllables with a pen on her book and read in unison with the children, the overall effect being not unlike the ritualis - tic chanting of a religious ceremony. (You really need to see the YouTube video to get the full effect.) So, there sits Bush as the Satanic High Priest in Devil’s Paradise, listening to little black children (yes, skin color does matter to the occultists...what, you thought they were politically correct?) chant out a humorous story about a pet goat—which is actually a thinly-veiled simplification of the Luciferian Doc - trine—while people burn to death in the North Tower and UA175 slams into"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"34 T—ff MThttfi Dftffi ffflTh\u0016tt BThTh\u0015 \u0014ffi fi—ff WThfl\u0013\u0012 the South Tower in New York City. Crowley’s Liber 175 , “the book of Uniting to a particular Deity by devotion,” outlines precisely what the perpetrators are seeking to accomplish at that exact moment through their sadistic, homicidal ritualistic acts—unite themselves with Satan. And although the locations for these two events are separated by hundreds of miles, the two acts are bound together in an ingenious and sophisticated manner by a cohesive ritual unity. Atta B oy T here is yet another, potentially more disturbing aspect to the selection of Sarasota as the backdrop for the Bush-Baphomet Black Mass. Roughly ten miles south of Sarasota is Venice, Florida, and the Venice Municipal Air - port, home to Huffman Aviation, where Mohamed Atta and another purport - ed 9/11 conspirator allegedly undertook flight training. Subsequently, both individuals trained for a brief time at Jones Aviation in ... Sarasota. Of the hundreds of flight schools in the United States, Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists and the hijacker-pilot of the first plane to hit its target on the morning of September 11, 2001, attended a school located in the very city President Bush was visiting that same fateful morning, where he was presiding over the Pet-Goat Ritual Reading. Bush was in his Devil’s Paradise while Atta (so we are led to believe) was busy gaining entry into the Islamic Paradise of Martyrs. This is neither coincidence nor synchronicity; rather, it is yet another ex - ample of the twisted humor and sophisticated logistics employed in the 9/11 MegaRitual. Welcome to Terrorland T here is, however, even more to the Sarasota-Bush-Atta story. Venice Munic- ipal Airport is reported to be a long-time base of operations for the CIA, with allegations of a 60+ year history of “Company”-sanctioned drug running. In fact, some investigative reporters refer to Florida as “Terrorland” (see Welcome to Terrorland: Mohamed Atta & the 9-11 Cover-up in Florida by Daniel Hopsicker) and tell of CIA training camps, banks used to launder drug money, and flight schools/airports used for discreet arms-drugs-cash transfers. There are obvious implications here that the CIA (or elements within in) was involved on some level with the events of 9/11—a theory supported by many other pieces of evidence. Bush’s presence in Sarasota on 9/11 could then"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"35 T—ff PffTh GttfiTh be viewed as a tip-of-the-hat to the CIA’s historical activity in that area (keep in mind, too, that Bush Sr. was head of the Agency in 1977-78). And let’s not for - get that on 9/11 the governor of Florida—where the 2000 Presidential elec - tion was allegedly “stolen”—was none other than Jeb Bush. (For more on this topic, see Appendix C, “The Mohamed Atta Myth,” on page 175.) Mohamed Atta’s Flying Circus of Death: The Greatest Show on Earth Y et another highly attractive aspect of Sarasota from an occult perspective is that, in 1919, Ringling Brothers Circus established its winter home there, and performers and staff members began to settle in Sarasota, as did some of the seven Ringling Brothers, all of whom were Masons. Decades later in 1968, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College located there, as well, and new CIA recruits were reportedly sent to the college from Langley to learn sleight-of-hand. Clowns are modern incarnations of the trickster deity—of which Hermes, Pan and Satan are all prime examples. The trick - ster-clown is a Jungian archetype, and the most ancient clowns have been found in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt. Through inverted speech, illogical actions, mimicry of spirits and animals, and ludicrous acrobatic stunts, clowns perform functions attribut - ed to Tricksters in mythology, blurring boundaries, toying with social and sexual r ules, and mixing the obscene with the sacred. 7 There has emerged a much darker contemporary image of the clown, how - ever—the evil clown, in which the playful trope of the clown is rendered disturbing through the use of horror elements and dark humor. Cultural critic Mark Dery has theorized the postmodern archetype of the evil clown in “Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstruct - ing Psycho-Killer Clowns.” Tracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across popular culture, Dery analyzes the “Pogo the Clown” persona of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the obscene clowns of the neo-sit - uationist Cacophony Society; the Joker (of “Bat - man” Fame); the grotesque art of R .K. Sloane; the sick-funny Bobcat Goldthwaite comedy Shakes the Clown; and Stephen King’s It."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36 T—ff MThttfi Dftffi ffflTh\u0016tt BThTh\u0015 \u0014ffi fi—ff WThfl\u0013\u0012 Using Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of the carnivalesque, Jungian and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the Information Age, Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. 8 C lowns, especially evil clowns, are often depicted as murderous psycho - paths, an apt description of the occult perpetrators of the 9/11 MegaRitual, who used pseudo-Islamic-extremist patsies to pilot planes full of terrified pas - sengers through the skies into buildings (and into the ground, where Flight 93 disappeared completely in an astonishing vanishing act), in what one could call a Flying Circus of Death—the Greatest Show on Earth, with performanc - es in New York, Washington and Shanksville, and ‘ringleader’ Mohamed Atta as ringmaster. The Infamous Seven Minutes Revisited I n light of all we have learned about Bush’s seemingly innocent little trip to Sarasota, we return to those troublesome seven minutes. Film maker Mi - chael Moore observed that, “Not knowing what to do—with no one telling him what to do—and no Secret Service rushing in to take him to safety, Mr. Bush just sat there and continued to read ‘My Pet Goat’ [sic] with the chil - dren,” the obvious implication being that Bush was simply too stupid and/or indecisive to do anything else. Bush himself would have us believe that he sim- ply didn’t want to startle the little tykes, and most people readily accepted that explanation, as if in collective agreement that the entire classroom of second-graders would have all shit their pants if he’d gotten up and walked out. Now, however, Bush’s actions, or rather his temporary inaction, makes more sense. Andrew Card’s timely delivery of the message regarding the impact of the second plane may or may not have been a scripted element of the MegaRitual (although having the High Priest visibly acknowledge the receipt of news con- firming the successful execution of a companion ritual hundreds of miles away is a nice touch), but in any case, Bush sure the hell wasn’t going to get up and interrupt an ode to the Goat. Bush’s immobility even caught the eye of his arch nemesis, Osama bin Laden, whose alleged comments on the matter are reproduced below from the full transcript of a videotaped monologue sent to Al Jazeera in 2004:"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"37 T—ff PffTh GttfiTh And for the record, we had agreed with the Commander-General Mu- hammad Atta, Allah have mercy on him, that all the operations should be carried out within 20 minutes, before Bush and his administration notice. It never occurred to us that the commander-in-chief of the Amer - ican armed forces would abandon 50,000 of his citizens in the twin tow - ers to face those great horrors alone, the time when they most needed him. But because it seemed to him that occupying himself by talking to the little girl about the goat and its butting was more important than oc - cupying himself with the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers, we were given three times the period required to execute the operations— all praise is due to Allah. 9 “...the goat and its butting was more important than occupying himself with the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers”... Osama had a sense of humor? Who the hell knew? He has the world’s largest military and most-for - midable intelligence services scouring the earth for him, and he’s cracking jokes on Al Jazeera. Or, perhaps those who say that Bin Laden was a CIA as - set/scapegoat/boogeyman are right, and it’s not Osama mocking us, but the Shadow Government and the orchestrators of the 9/11 Global MegaRitual. It is certainly worth noting that Bin Laden initially denied involvement with the attacks. On September 16, 2001, three years before turning comedian, Bin Laden issued a statement that was broadcast on Al Jazeera in which he said emphati - cally, “I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation.” (Last time I checked, terrorist masterminds weren’t in the habit of denying responsibility for acts of violence.)

And where was DoD’s a ccounting division located? In the west wing, which was in the final stages of renovation at the time, and into which those responsible for conducting the related investigation had recently been relocated. Now, to some crackpot types, this might all sound a tad suspicious— throw in the fact that the groundbreaking ceremony for the Pentagon was held on September 11, 1941, 60 years to the day before 9/11, and we’ve got our - selves a genuine conspiracy theory. 77: “Magical Power in Perfection” F light 77 strikes the Pentagon, which sits on the 77 th Meridian West and is 77 feet tall. Anton Szandor LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and author of The Satanic Bible , lists the 77 “infernal names” of the “Gods and Goddesses called upon, which make up a large part of the occupancy of the Royal Palace of Hell.” The number 77 is also a Masonic signal, the number of the Revenge of Lamech, ancestor of Hiram Abiff the Master Mason. Written in 1941 and originally entitled “the Book of the Goat” ( The Pet Goat , anyone?), Aleister Crowley’s Liber OZ (or Book 77 ) is a single page pur - porting to declare mankind’s basic and intrinsic rights according to Crowley’s philosophy of Thelema, and he considered it as a sort of manifesto for OTO.

Again we discover, as in Act One, a number of supreme occult significance, ceremonially coupled with a potent super-sized occult symbol, in this case, the Pentagon. Pentagon: Powerful Symbol S ymbols don’t kill people; people with symbols kill people. The pentagram is not universally held to be a symbol of evil—some cultures have considered it as a sign of protection and good fortune. However, it also has a long history of asso - ciation with the dark arts. As with firearms, the difference is the intent of the user. The antiquity of the pentagon’s use as an occult symbol is well demonstrat - ed by the following quote from Friedrich Nicolai (1733-1811), a bookseller, Freemason and member of the Bavarian Illuminati. Writing in 1782, he stated: What properly was the sign of the Baffomet, ‘figura Baffometi,’ ... cannot be exactly determined... I believe it to have been the Pythagorean penta - gon (Fünfeck) of health and prosperity ... It is well known how holy this figure was considered, and that the Gnostics had much in common with the Pythagoreans ... it appears that these serpent-worshippers believed they must produce a token that they had been clean on earth. I believe that this token was also the holy pentagon, the sign of their initiation. However, the idea of causing damage to a symbol of protection is also at - tractive to practitioners of the dark arts. Writing in Magic: White and Black , Franz Hartmann, writing about the pentagram, observes, “The spiritual knowl - edge of the Five-pointed Star is identical with its practical application. Let us beware that the figure is always well drawn, leaving no open space, through which the enemy can enter and disturb the harmony existing in the Pentagon ” [emphasis added]. According to The Donning International Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary , the pentagram is the “most powerful symbol of all ceremonial rites,” and among the powers ascribed to it is the notification of “etheric world intelligences.” The"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"43 A—ffflffifi! pentagram, which contains a pentagon at its heart, is widely used to evoke spirits, and the inverted pentagram, a universal Satanic symbol, to sum- mon demons and even the Devil himself.

Happy Birthday, Mr. Olson T heodore Olson served as United States Solicitor under President George W. Bush from June 2001 to July 2004. Previously, Olson had successfully rep - resented then presidential candidate George W. Bush in the Supreme Court case B ush v. Gore , which ended the Florida recount in the 2000 Presidential election, effectively handing Bush the Presidency. 2 As fate would have it, Mr. Olson was born on Sep - tember 11, 1940, and, as fate would also have it, Ol - son’s third wife, Barbara, just happened to be a passen- ger on hijacked American Airlines Flight 77—which, on S eptember 11, 2001, crashed into the Pentagon, for which the groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 11, 1941 . A string of Satanic synchronicities? A cruel cosmic joke played on a poor soul unfortunate enough to have been born on September 11th? Or, perhaps, something altogether different... On 9/11, Barbara Olson—a lawyer and conservative com- mentator who worked for CNN, Fox News, and other outlets— was on her way to Los Angeles for a taping of Politically Incorrect , on which she was a regular guest. Under normal circumstances, she would have departed the previous evening, but stayed home to be with her husband on the morning of his birthday. According to Ted Olson, his wife phoned him after the hijacking had commenced and informed him that the hijackers had knives and boxcutters"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"44 T—ff Mflffifi DThftttff\u0017fl\u0016ffi Bflfl\u0015 \u0014ft fi—ff Wfl\u0017\u0013\u0012 (shanks), a key detail in the overall 9/11 scenario. Again according to Ted Ol - son, this call was cut off, as was a second call, during which Olson claimed to have informed his wife of the two crashes at the Twin Towers. Those researching this incident on the internet will find claims that Ted Olson’s version of events reportedly changed several times, with him first claiming that his wife had called him from her cell phone, and later, a seatback phone. Researchers will also find conflicting reports regarding whether or not 757s had seatback phones in 2001, and whether or not it was possible to make cell phone calls from an airplane in flight. Then there are related claims that the calls Mrs. Olson placed from the seatback phone were collect calls, and also that an official FBI report stated that there was only one call placed to the Justice Department and it lasted 0 seconds. There is even online speculation that Ted Olson’s fourth wife (but who’s counting), Lady Evelyn Booth, is actually a still-very- much-alive Barbara Olson after plastic surgery, which, given all of the other “peculiarities” surrounding this incident, is in fact quite intriguing, as is the following little detail. Lady Evelyn Cobbold (1867-1963) achieved celebrity at the age of 65, in 1933, when she became the first British-born Muslim woman to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca. Taking into consideration the radical-Muslim cover story employed by the orchestrators of the 9/11 MegaRitual, as well as their propensity towards dark humor and outright mockery of the victims and general public (as well as the remarkable facial and other physical similarities between Barbara and Lady Evelyn), one could draw the conclusion that the entire incident was a ruse. The 9/11 birthday boy may or may not have knowingly and selflessly endured the sacrifice of his beloved third wife (but who’s counting) so that America, nay, the world, could have a play-by-play via cell phone of Flight 77’s doomed journey to the Pentagon, and learn the method by which the hijackers took control of the plane(s). Barbara may or may not in fact have been on that plane, and Lady Evelyn may or may not be Ted’s third and fourth wife. Was what happened, whatever that may be, all simply the cruel hand of fate? Or, was this the case of a Washington insider chosen for a special task in the 9/11 MegaRitual because of a personal connection to this highly-significant occult date? And, perhaps, one helluva reward—in the form of a major supporting role in the star-studded cast of the Greatest Show on Earth—for his participation in what many believe to be the theft of the American Presidency in 2000?"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"45 A—ffflffifi! As Below, So Above... O n the morning of 9/11, a white “mystery plane” was spotted in the skies over Washington, DC. In the minutes immediately following the attack on the Pentagon, it was seen circling in the restricted airspace above the White House, further alarming already tense Secret Service agents. As Mark Gaffney details in his book, The 9/11 Mystery Plane , the aircraft turned out to be an E-4B, the world’s most advanced com - munications platform and state-of-the-art airborne com- mand center. The $800 million aircraft is a modified Boe - ing 747-200, and is characteristically painted white with its mos t distinguishing feature being a pronounced pod locat - ed directly behind the cockpit. L et’s put this bit of information in context: the Air Force, which couldn’t manage to get a single interceptor fighter-jet in the air that morning until it was too late, had its aptly-named “Doomsday Plane” aloft in the skies above Washington at the very moment the Pentagon was sup - posedly struck with pin-point accuracy by a flying dunce (after he performed a 330- degree downward spiral that lasted over 3 minutes, mind you). Even though the airspace above Washington is the most heavily monitored on the entire planet, the Pentagon never ordered an evacuation of the building, and as a result 125 servicemen and women died—again, as with the victims in the Twin Towers, amidst flame and smoke. “The Pentagon was simply not aware that this aircraft was coming our way,” one official is quoted as saying in David Ray Griffin’s foreword to Gaffney’s book—which is a patently absurd statement given the blanket, overlapping ground radar coverage of the area, and even more so considering the presence of the E-4B. We are to believe, then, that not only did Hani Hanjour perform one hell of a feat of kamikaze barnstorming, but snuck up on the nerve center of the most formidable military in the world as well, right under the watchful eye of its most sophisticated surveillance aircraft? (Any suggestion that bureaucratic paralysis or lack of real-time information or adequate threat analysis or proto - col was to blame strains credibility to the breaking point.) And just when you think that you’ve heard it all, that the entire scenar - io couldn’t get any more ridiculously suspicious (or suspiciously ridiculous), this little fact emerges: in information obtained from the FAA in 2008 under a FOIA request, we learn the call sign of the doomsday plane circling in the skies above DC on 9/11...VENUS77."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46 T—ff Mflffifi DThftttff\u0017fl\u0016ffi Bflfl\u0015 \u0014ft fi—ff Wfl\u0017\u0013\u0012 That’s right. Yet another 77 (apparently you just can’t have too many), and, wouldn’t you know it, yet another pentagram reference: the successive inferior conjunc - tions of the planet Venus against the Z odiac form a pentagram, thus in occult thought this geometric form represents Venus, and Ve - nus invokes the pentagram...just Goo gle it.

It’s more, more of the amazing Fly- ing Circus of ... oh, hell, nevermind. Gimme Five: The House of Death A s has been far more than duly noted, occultists believe that numbers con- tain inherent spiritual and temporal power, and that to launch a plan without inc orporating the proper occult power numbers could doom the plan to failure. The Pentagon is a 5-sided building, with 5 concentric rings and 5 above- ground floors (5-5-5), and a 5-acre central plaza, which, interestingly enough, is also referred to as “ground zero,” a nickname that originated during the Cold War with the logical assumption that the USSR would target the Pentagon in the event of nuclear war. According to the official version of events, there were 5 hijackers onboard Flight 77, and the Pentagon sits just across the Potomac River from the Washington Monument, which is 555 feet tall (a fact men- tioned four times in Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol ). If this last sentence strikes you as over-zealous piling on, recall the inten- tional (and zealous) piling on of the number 77, and consider this: modern occultists hold 5 to be the Number of Death, and the number five, according to some, is sacred to the hoariest of secret societies —the Illuminati. Just Typical A s a case study in the purposely-generated information fog that exists around all as- pects of 9/11, the Flight 77-Pentagon element is particularly instructive. The obviously conflict - ing theories are typical of the entire event. There are claims that the doomed flights of 9/11 were never in fact scheduled for that day; that they never took off; that there were fake passenger manifests and/or fictitious passengers; that the planes which were claimed to have crashed were airborne well after the time they were re - ported down; that some of the hijackers are still alive, and on and on. One report claims that Flights 11 and 175 appeared to have crossed paths at precisely the same time over Stuart Air Force Base, but in ac- tuality they shut off their transponders, landed and were replaced by already-airborne drones which then began broadcasting counterfeit signatures and were then used in the attacks on the Twin Towers. Many, if not all, of the components of the 9/11 script were designed to confuse, to distract, to mesmerize, to appear suspicious on second glance and thus suck investigators and conspir - acy theorists alike down a bottomless rabbit hole of misinformation and disinformation."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"47 A—ffflffifi! In basic terms, the number five symbolizes the five points of the pentagram and all that it connotes—death, in particular, in this instance. Some occult - ists would contend that the greatest intensification of a number of power is its triplicate, with 555 thus yielding “Highest Death”; the U.S. Military may disagree slightly with this interpretation, however, as the rank of their most senior operational commanders is that of “five- star” (five 5-pointed stars). So, as many would argue is the case even without refer - ence to five as the number of death, the Pentagon is a House of Death (or, if you take this line of reasoning to its logical extent, The House of Highest Death, and who could really argue with that)—as it most certainly was to those soldiers who lost their lives within its walls on 9/11 in what by all appearances was a self-inflicted wound."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter Six Ritual Murder As Mind Control ...a clown-like, grinning mockery of the victim(s) as a show of power and macabre arro - gance.

Could this really be what it ap - pears to be? Is there any historical precedent for this type of thing? The Prophet of 9/11 M ichael Hoffman is a former reporter for the New York bureau of the Associated Press, and the first edition of his Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare was published in 1989, well before September 11, 2001. His work was prescient not in that it actually predicted 9/11, but in that it clearly defined the motives and modus operan - di of those ultimately responsible for the terror attacks— and this would not be Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda. Much of Secret Societies reads as though it were written spe- cifically about 9/11, and Hoffman notes in particular the diffi - culty we have accepting the idea that we could be manipulated on a mass scale: The issue of controlling humanity with esoteric words and symbols encoded within a play, a media spectacular or a"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"50 T—ff Mfittffi DTh\u0019\u0018ff\u0017fi\u0016tt Bfifi\u0015 \u0014\u0019 ffi—ff Wfi\u0017\u0013\u0012 ritual is one of the most difficult for people to comprehend.... Even as [modern man] dances to the tune of the elite managers of human be- havior, he scoffs with great derision at the idea of the existence and op - eration of a technology of mass mind control emanating from the media and government. 1 Hoffman further observes that “ritual murder is mind control,” and refers to the machinery of manipulation as “a technological tyranny so immense it is difficult to grasp. It is both a physical, technological tyranny as well as a tyranny of the mind.” 2 Like Clockwork H offman describes modern existence as “life in an open-air mind control laboratory”: In the study of mind control and psychological warfare, it is not enough to simply review the latest technology of coercion, the most recent gad - getry and techno-junk littering the hardware and supply depots of gov - ernments and cults. Far more dangerous than these appliances is the praxis behind them, the underground current which informs the modern project and this modern era. For life in our modern era is little more than life in an open-air mind control laboratory where a form of human alchemy has emerged to transform the mass of targeted percipients—targeted mere- ly by virtue of their being urban dwellers plugged into the electronic and digital pageantry of the Establishment’s system-of-things. 3 “The induction of terror into the mass mind of Americans in association with certain key-words and key-symbols or ‘sigils’ in connection with con- trol-symbols” Hoffman states, “is the most efficacious means of ensuring a brain-dead and mind-controlled, subject population.” 4 He continues, asserting that “ritual murder is mind control...symbolism embedded within terrorism and achieved with seeming invincible accomplishment by ‘invisible’ princi - pals, is a great way to control and process people.” 5 Hoffman explains that it is the subconscious mind that is being targeted in occult ritual. “In occult crimes the objective is not linear,” he states, “that is to say, is not solely bound to the achievement of the immediate effects of the attack on the victim, but may in fact be a part of a larger, symbolic ritual mag -"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"51 R—fffittffi MfiTh\u0019\u0018Th tt\u0017 M—\u0016\u0019 C\u0015\u0016ffTh\u0015ffi nified by the power of the electronic media, for the purpose of the alchemical processing of the subconscious Group Mind of the masses.” Hoffman contin- ues, telling us that “it is the subconscious that is being addressed in occult rit - ual, in a process CIA behavioral scientist Dr. Ewan Cameron termed, ‘psychic driving’.” 6 “The Black Arts adepts,” he concludes, “are not simply ‘crazed’, nor are such intensely publicized ritual murders merely superstitious sacrifices to some kooky devil-god.” They are in fact “a brilliantly orchestrated ritual whose cere- monial aspects were as precise and detailed as the internal workings of a clock.” Tick-Tock."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven “Let’s Roll” ...humor is all-important and the most appalling crimes may be committed under its cloak...ghoulish murders with a Puckish sense of fun. —Stephen Knight, Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution Act Four: United Airlines Flight 93 and Shanksville “L et’s roll,” were the last words she heard him say as he put down the phone and joined a group of fellow passengers as they prepared to attempt to regain control of the airplane from the hijackers.

The Vice-President had au- thorized the Air Force to shoot down the aircraft: was that what actually brought the plane down? There were reports of a wider debris field, with wreckage strewn about in other locations. If the entire plane had gone in nose first at such a high rate of speed that it left a practically wreckageless Wile-E.-Coyote silhouette in the ground, how could there be debris elsewhere? So, here again, before we even get started dissecting this component of the MegaRitual to expose its grisly innards and occult inner-workings, something already stinks to high heaven. Shanksville A ccording to official accounts, on the morning of 9/11, Islamic radicals forced their way into the cockpits of four separate airplanes using box - cutters, with which they injured or killed a number of persons. In colloquial terms, the victims were “shanked” (see the Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions , published by McGraw Hill), and the whole affair might be insensitively referred to as “shanksville.” Now, if even after all of the other instances of the use of morbid hu - mor that have been elucidated thus far (and remain to be exposed in further ch apters) you still find it difficult to accept this idea—the notion that the orchestrators of the MegaRitual engineered the real-or-faked crash of a jet - liner in a specific location because its name provided another instrument for the mock ery of the victims and of the public at large—well, it won’t come as any comfort to you to learn that manipulat - ing the circumstances surrounding rituals so as to cr eate “meaningful coincidences” (involving place names, the names of victims, etc.) is a common practice among occultists. And it may further disrupt your sense of reality to learn the following: one Bill Crowley was the field"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"55 “L—tt’ft Rffififi” director in the Pittsburgh Office of the FBI, which has jurisdiction at Shanks - ville. Certainly, you may be thinking at this point, the author is not insinuating what he appears to be: that the planners of 9/11 somehow pre-positioned an individual (either uninvolved and unsuspecting or complicit in some fashion) with the Crowley surname in this law enforcement position so that the name Crowley would be connected with the event in media reports. That would be absurd... Perhaps, except for the fact that they turn right around and do almost ex - actly the same thing in Act Five, ingeniously engineering circumstances so that the Crowley surname appears in numerous media reports connected with the incident. And, on top of that, the name of the location for the next component of the MegaRitual is, like Shanksville, slang—and to top it all off, slang famous - ly connected with Aleister Crowley himself. As Michael Hoffman astutely observes, “Coincidence can be summoned. It’s a matter of attention and timing.” All too true, and we haven’t even gotten to the numbers, symbols and other occult elements yet, where we’ll find more Crowley and more mockery. Flight 93: An Airmail Greeting to Thelemites Worldwide I t shouldn’t surprise the reader at this stage in the reconstruction of the script to learn that 93 is of great significance in Aleister Crowley’s Thelema. The central philosophical concepts of Thelema are encapsulated in two phrases from Crowley’s Liber AL : “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law” and “Love is the law, love under will.” The two key terms in these sentences are “Will” and “Love”; in Greek, Thelema and Agape. Employing isopsephy, which is the Greek practice of assigning a numerical value to the letters of a word and then adding them to obtain their sum (similar to gematria), the value of both these words equals 93. It is common for Thelemites to greet each other with “93” in person as well as in the opening and closing of written correspondence. This custom derives from Crowley’s instruction that Thelemites should greet each other with the Law of Thelema by saying, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” Since saying the entire Law can be cumbersome, using 93 has become a kind of shorthand. In informal written correspondence, one often finds the number singularly at the head of a letter and in the form “93/93” at the end. In this case, the ini - tial “93” stands in for “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56 T—tt Mftffifi DflThfftt\u0017ft\u0016ffi Bftft\u0015 \u0014Th fi—tt Wft\u0017\u0013\u0012 “93/93” stands for “Love is the law, love under will.” Crowley often used this form within his own letters, and wrote thusly on the matter: I am often asked why I begin my letters this way. No matter whether I am writing to my lady or to my butcher, always I begin with these eleven words. Why, how else should I begin? What other greeting could be so glad? Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me, sister, there is no law beyond Do what thou wilt! 1 Writing in The Confessions of Aleister Crowley , he further states that, “The matter is of extreme importance; because Aiwass in dictating The Book of the Law repeatedly makes use of correspondences in Greek, such as Thelema, Will, 93 – Agape, Love, 93 ... his own name spelt in Hebrew has the value 93.” Elsewhere in Confessions , Crowley adds, “93 is also the number of the Secret Word of the Neophyte of A:. A:., a word indicating symbolically the whole course of existence.” Well, son of a bitch. Flight 93 was a flying airmail greeting to Thelemites around the globe...and they’re not even done yet. Let’s Roll (or, maybe not) J ust as alleged Flight 77 passenger Barbara Olson’s supposed call to husband Ted gave us the crucial detail concerning the hijackers’ use of box-cutters, Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer’s supposed in-flight phone call to customer service supervisor Lisa Jefferson at GTE Airfone’s Chicago call center gave us the battle-cry for 9/11. According to Jefferson, these were the last words she heard Beamer say after he laid the phone down to join a passenger revolt against the terrorists. As the Washington Post reported, by May 2002 “Let’s roll” had been “embraced and promoted by President Bush as a patriotic battle cry,” and was “now em- blazoned on Air Force fighter planes, city fire trucks, school athletic jerseys, and countless T-shirts, baseball caps and souvenir buttons.” The Post further noted, “It’s also commemorated in popular songs.” The London Evening Standard called Beamer’s final words “a symbol of America’s determination to fight back,” and Rowland Morgan, author of the book Flight 93 Revealed , concluded: “Truly, the Let’s Roll slogan had become a call to arms—just at a time the White House needed it most.”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"57 “L—tt’ft Rffififi” Beamer was able to talk to Jefferson for 13 min- utes, even though many calls were being dropped due to high call volume. In her 2002 book, Let’s Roll!: Or- dinary People, Extraordinary Courage , Todd’s wife Lisa Beamer revealed that Jefferson had informed her that “it was a miracle that Todd’s call hadn’t been discon- nected.” Due to the incredible number of calls being placed that morning, Lisa explains, “the GTE systems overloaded and lines were being disconnected all around [ Jefferson] as she sat at the operator’s station outside of Chicago, talking to Todd. [ Jefferson] kept thinking, This call is going to get dropped! Yet Todd stayed connected ... all the way to the end.” In her own 2006 book, Called (now that’s funny, I don’t care who you are), Jefferson wrote, “[H]is voice was devoid of any stress. In fact, he sounded so tranquil it made me begin to doubt the authenticity and urgency of his call.” Jefferson told Beamer’s wife: “If I hadn’t known it was a real hijacking, I’d have thought it was a crank call, because Todd was so rational and methodical about what he was doing.” This would be an observation echoed by Lyz Glick, wife of another Flight 93 passenger Jeremy Glick, who, in describing a call from her husband recalled, “He was so calm, the plane sounded so calm, that if I hadn’t seen what was go- ing on on the TV, I wouldn’t have believed it.” She continued, “I was surprised by how calm it seemed in the background. I didn’t hear any screaming. I didn’t hear any noises. I didn’t hear any commotion.” Similarly, concerning passenger Lauren Grandcolas’ voice message to her husband Jack, journalist and author Jere Longman recounts, “It sounded to Jack as if she were driving home from the grocery store or ordering a pizza.” Jack Grandcolas later states, “She sounded calm. There is absolutely no back - ground noise on her message. You can’t hear people screaming or yelling or crying. It’s very calm, the whole cabin, the background, there’s really very little sound.” An entire plane-load of cool, collected frequent flyers and hijacker-battling heroes, one of whom just happens to utter forth the phrase that becomes the rallying cry for the all-hell-unleashed, shock-and-awe retribution heaped upon the heads of Islamic radicals and their supporters, enemies far and wide, real and imagined? Certainly not impossible, but in context of everything else we know (and suspect) about the falsehoods of 9/11, this very much sounds like more of the same old chicanery and force-fed propaganda."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58 T—tt Mftffifi DflThfftt\u0017ft\u0016ffi Bftft\u0015 \u0014Th fi—tt Wft\u0017\u0013\u0012 Bizzaro-world S everal witnesses in and around Shanksville reported seeing a white cor - porate jet flying low and fast in the vicinity of the crash site immediate- ly before and after the stated time of impact. Eye-witnesses were very clear that what they saw was not the doomed Flight 93—which yet other witnesses claimed to have seen flying not at the steep angle that would’ve been required for the craft to disappear entirely into the soil, but at a much lesser angle. Compellingly, USGS aerial photography of the mine site dating to well be- fore 9/11 shows a narrow trench in the landscape of exactly the same width, depth and length, and in precisely the same location, as the supposed Flight 93 crash site. The only difference in the before and after images—the central crater where the fuselage reportedly burrowed completely out of sight, a sim- ple round feature easily enough added with a bomb, missile or other explosive device. There was an additional eyewitness report, however, that added even fur - ther intrigue to the incident. One local resident stated on camera that while stopped at an intersection in a rural area near the location of the crash, her van was overflown by what appeared to be a white aircraft so low to the ground that she dove to the floorboard of her vehicle. The most interesting aspect of her account, though, was that she claimed that the “plane” made absolutely no noise whatsoever, had no markings what - soever (as well as no distinguishable details, such as would be readily visible from that distance, appearing to have been created as a solid unit, the result of a molding process perhaps), flew underneath telephone wires, and, as the flying vehicle banked hard upwards to avoid the tree line, produced no discern- ible wake. That’s either some really creative b.s. generated by psyop experts or evidence that the orchestrators of 9/11 have access to some mind-blowing technology and are using it against the American public. Adding (Further) Insult to Injury: “The Crescent of Embrace” A ccording to the official government version of events, Islamic terrorists bring down Flight 93, killing all aboard ... and the memorial designers propose a crescent-shaped design highly evocative of the Islamic crescent and named “The Crescent of Embrace.” There are even claims that the Crescent of Embrace, as it was originally proposed and would have been oriented in the landscape, pointed directly to Mecca, a common practice in Islamic architec - ture.

Suspicious Minds A gain, from the outset, suspicious circumstances, unanswered questions, and we haven’t even begun peeling the onion. Once we do, we will of course find Crowley (both Aleister and Tim), as well as the Egyptian god Thoth, whom you’ve actually already met in his other incarnation as the Greek god Hermes. But before that, let’s listen to a little Ozzy Osbourne. “White Horse” J ohn Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne’s 40+ year career was launched when he rose to prom- inence as lead singer of the pioneering En- glish heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which time he became known as the “Prince of Darkness” (he has since become known as the “Godfather of Heavy Metal” if that’s any improvement). Recording albums with titles such as “Speak of the Devil” in his subsequent solo career, Osbourne was ac - cused of Satanism, and more than one commentator has compared the controversy surrounding Osbourne to accusations leveled against Aleister Crowley. Both men were certainly demonized by the media and religious groups and enjoyed the infamy associated with being la - beled Satanists. In 2002, Osbourne and wife Sharon were invited to the White House Cor - respondents’ Association dinner, where President Bush noted his presence by joking: “The thing about Ozzy is, he’s made a lot of hit recordings—‘Party with the Animals’, ‘Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath’, ‘Facing Hell’, ‘Black Skies’ and ‘Blood -"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"63 M—ffffiThRA M—KAThfittffiThft bath in Paradise’.” He continued (again jokingly one would hope, but after all we’ve learned here, who knows), “Ozzy, Mom loves your stuff.” Osbourne abused drugs and alcohol most of his life, and his excesses led to, among numerous other things, getting himself banned from the city of San Antonio for an entire decade for drunkenly urinating across from the Alamo while wear - ing his future wife’s dress. Likewise, Crowley had been a notorious heroin addict, and in his 1980 song, “Mr. Crowley,” Osbourne made reference to this fact, singing, “Mr. Crowley, won’t you ride my white horse? Mr. Crowley, it’s symbolic of course.” White horse—slang for heroin. You fooled all the people with magic, (Yeah) You waited on Satan’s call...Mr. Crowley... Three for the Price of One L eaving the mouth of a metal god, we now turn to the mouth of an Egyptian god. Thoth, Hermes and the Roman god Mercury were all held to be one- and-the-same. Of particular relevance in relation to 9/11 is that Thoth is heav - ily associated with the art of magic and the judgment of the dead (Certain of Thoth’s other aspects, particularly as the God of Time, will come into play later.) Various scholars hold Egyptian religion to be primarily henotheistic, where all the gods and goddesses were aspects of the sun god Ra, similar to the devas in Hinduism. In this view, Thoth was considered to be the heart— which, according to ancient Egyptians, is the seat of intelligence or mind—and tongue of Ra, the means by which his will was translated into speech. The Opening of the Mouth Ceremony D escribed in various funerary texts, the Opening of the Mouth ceremony was an ancient Egyptian ritual involving the sym- bolic animation of a statue or mummy by magically opening its mouth so that it could breathe and speak. The Book of the Dead also contains a spell for this process, and this text reads in part, “Thoth has come fully equipped with spells, He looses the bonds of Seth from"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"64 T—ff MffiThRA DKAfittffftffi\u0016Th Bffiffi\u0015 \u0014fi RA—ff Wffift\u0013\u0012 my mouth...” This ritual essentially gives life after death, focusing on the mouth in order to allow the spirit to spring forth from the body. The Number 85 G ematria is a system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase, in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other, or bear some relation to the number itself as may apply to a person’s age, the calendar year, etc. According to Strong’s Concordance , the transliteration of the Hebrew word for mouth is “peh.” Peh is the 17th letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and as sym- bolic of the mouth, Peh represents the capacity for speech and self-expression. The letter Peh spelled in full, Peh Heh, equals 85 through gematria and cor - relates with the tongue as an organ of speech. The sound “peh” is made by the air bursting forth from the mouth, and is thus related to the Opening of the Mouth ceremony. Peh and the Tower Card P eh is attributed to The Tower by the Golden Dawn, in which the card sym- bolizes the destruction of old structures and could be thought of as a form of purification. The illustration for The Tower in Aleister Crowley’s Book of Thoth shows the eye of Shiva opening at the top: reality is the dream of Shiva, and when he awakens, all is destroyed. I n “Gematria,” from 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley, we find: “85. PH, the letter P‚ 85 = 5 x 17: even the highest unity, if it move or energise, means War.” Flight 85, the 85 in motion, engergized—9/11 would in- deed be used to facilitate war, multiple wars. Further, Peh is connected to The Tower, to destruction, and is thus a ref - erence to the demolition of the Twin Towers, the basis for those wars ... and all of this takes place under the auspices of Thoth-Hermes, in Whitehorse.

Due to the severity of the damage and low water pressure in the vicinity, firefighting efforts were greatly hampered and fires on multiple floors burned uncontrolled for hours. The North Tower had collapsed at 10:28 a.m., and WTC 7 remained standing until 5:21 p.m. Writing in the New York Times in November of 2001, journalist James Glanz said of WTC 7: “By 11:30 a.m., the fire commander in charge of that area, Assistant Chief Frank Fellini, ordered firefighters away from it for safety reasons.” End of story? Not hardly. Giuliani’s Skybox Bunker A fter the 1993 World Trade Center attack, an Emergency Operations Cen- ter (EOC) was created to coordinate local, state and federal efforts in the event of a disaster like 9/11. Naturally, the EOC was located in 7 World Trade, directly adjacent to the target of the 1993 attack. Even better, the EOC was housed on the 23rd floor."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"68 T—Th Mftfiff DflttffiTh\u0017ft\u0016fi Bftft\u0015 \u0014tt ff—Th Wft\u0017\u0013\u0012 Numerous parties, including George Marlin, then executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owned the WTC, urged Rudolph “America’s Mayor” Giuliani not to locate the EOC at the Trade Center. And in 1998, New York Times columnist Bob Her - bert called Giuliani’s EOC a “skybox bunker”—with a heckuva view on 9/11, one might add—and ques - tioned the wisdom of locating a supposedly secure facility 23 stories above ground in a building shared by numerous private tenants and requiring eleva - tors to reach. But that wasn’t the half of it. To keep the EOC and elevators operational in the event of a power outage, backup generators were installed along with large storage tanks for the diesel fuel needed to run them. Yep, that’s right—the Emergency Operations Center for the City of New York was not only located yards from one of the most attractive terrorist targets in the entire world, was not only 23 floors in the air, but was sitting on top of thousands of gallons of flammable liquid. As the New York Times reported, “Fire Department officials warned the city and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1998 and 1999 that a giant diesel fuel tank for the mayor’s $13 million command bunker in 7 World Trade Center...posed a hazard and was not consistent with city fire codes.” Ya think? Investigators would later determine that the burning fuel weakened a transfer truss that allowed the skyscraper to be built atop multistory under - ground electrical transformers and was critical to the structural integrity of the building. (Interestingly, a failure of the same type of truss contributed to the partial collapse of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City when it was bombed in 1995.) Dr. John Osteraas with Exponent Failure Analysis Associates in Menlo Park, California, was quoted in the Times in 2002 concerning the collapse: “Without the fuel, I think the building would have done fine.” “Pull It” A high-rise Emergency Operations Center that provided front-row sky box seats to the most spectacular terrorist attacks in history...fuel stor - age tanks to run backup generators and elevators that, according to various assessments, were at least partially responsible for the collapse of the building itself...one can begin to understand why some have theorized that the EOC Rudy"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"69 K—Thft—ft? was in fact the command center for the at - tacks on the Twin Towers, and take more seriously the idea that WTC 7 was inten- tionally brought down after all. Ironically, weighing in in apparent sup - port of the latter notion was none other than the owner of the building, Larry Sil - verstein, who stated in a 2002 PBS docu- mentary entitled ‘America Rebuilds’: “I remember getting a call from the, er, fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, ‘We’ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.’ And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.” After two years of stonewalling, Silverstein Properties finally responded to numerous questions concerning what Mr. Silverstein meant when he used the phrase “pull it,” which most people would assume to mean “bring down by controlled demolition.” Their explanation? He meant pull the firefighters from the building. And exactly which firefighters would those be?...the ones that had withdrawn at 11:30 a.m., over five hours earlier? 1 Déjà Voodoo O n September 11, 2001, WTC 7 and the entire staff of the EOC were evac - uated after United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower. The direc - tor of the EOC at the time made the poignant observation that the center was out of commission “at the moment when it was needed most.” The evacuation of the EOC further hampered communication and rescue coordination ef - forts, which had been already compromised by a malfunctioning radio system that had been known to be faulty as early as March 2001. The deaths of some 121 firefighters in the North Tower, which collapsed second, were attributable to their not being able to hear the evacuation orders. If the primary objective in selecting the location for the EOC had been to create additional chaos and confusion in the event of a disaster, with regards to 9/11 specifically, they sure couldn’t have made a better choice than the 23rd floor of WTC 7 ... hey, wait a minute..."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"70 T—Th Mftfiff DflttffiTh\u0017ft\u0016fi Bftft\u0015 \u0014tt ff—Th Wft\u0017\u0013\u0012 Here we are again, confronted with circumstances that are beyond suspi - cious—absurd seems to be the norm—and we haven’t even begun to consider what occult kookiness may be waiting around the corner for us. But it’s there all right, you can count on it. Salomon’s Temple C ompleted in 1987 and constructed with a trapezoidal design, the 47-story World Trade Center 7, situated directly beside the Twin Towers, was known as the Salomon Brothers building. Recalling from Chapter Three that the Twin Towers represented the Two Pillars of Freemasonry, Jachin and Boaz, it shouldn’t surprise you to learn (if you didn’t already know) that according to tradition these pillars were located on the porch of, you betcha, King Solomon’s Temple. Noted English scientist, mathematician and theologian Sir Isaac Newton studied and wrote extensively about the Temple of Solomon, dedicating an entire chapter of The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms to his observations re- garding the temple. Newton was intrigued by the temple’s sacred geometry and believed that it was designed by King Solomon with divine guidance. Solomon’s Temple is intimately intertwined with the story of Hiram Ab - iff, who some consider to be the Freemason’s Messiah. According to Masonic legend, Hiram Abiff was a man of Tyre, the son of a widow, and the chief archi - tect of King Solomon’s Temple. Abiff, Masonry teaches, was the only person on Earth who knew the secrets of a Master Mason, including the most important secret of all, the “Grand Masonic Word,” the ineffable name, the name of God. To make a long story short, Hiram was killed for refusing to reveal this word, and then brought up out of the grave and restored to life. There is a Hiram from Tyre mentioned in the Bible in connection with the construction of the Temple, but not as chief architect: scripture is actually quite clear that God Himself was the designer and architect of the Temple. But that’s really neither here nor there, because the legend of Hiram Abiff is not based on an historical character but rather on the myth of the Egyptian Sun-god Osiris. 2 Writing in The Secret Teachings of All Ages , Manly P. Hall tells us that The efforts made to discover the origin of the Hiramic legend show that, while the legend in its present form is comparatively modern, its under - lying principles run back to remotest antiquity. It is generally admitted by modern Masonic scholars that the story of the martyred CHiram is based upon the Egyptian rites of Osiris, whose death and resurrection"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"71 K—Thft—ft? figuratively portrayed the spiritual death of man and his regeneration through initiation into the Mysteries. Hall continues, stating, “CHiram is also identified with Hermes through the inscription on the Emerald Table. From these associations it is evident that CHiram is to be considered as a prototype of humanity; in fact he is Plato’s Idea (archetype) of man. As Adam after the Fall symbolizes the Idea of human degeneration, so CHi - ram through his resurrection symbolizes the Idea of human regeneration.” Pretty deep stuff, and there’s more where that came from, but you get the point: Solomon’s Temple and Freemasonry go together like terrorists and hi - jacked airplanes. The 47th Problem of Euclid A ccording to the Bible, the Lord gave King David very exact mea - surements and specifications for Solo - mon’s Temple, an idea that must have struck the fancy of those responsible for the design of WTC 7, because the building was a deceptively-simple yet powerful modern occult-Masonic construct. Its trapezoidal shape and 47 stories were an architectural embod - iment of the 47th Problem of Euclid, more widely known as the Pythagore- an Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem has at - tracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruse- ness and intellectual prowess; popular references in movies, literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps and cartoons abound. There are a range of mathematical proofs for the theorem, but one is of particular interest: it was published by future-U.S.-President and Mason James A. Garfield, and instead of the customary square it utilized a trapezoid. The essence of the Pythagorean Theorem concerns the importance of establishing an architecturally true or correct foundation based on use of the square, an ability of great value to real masons, but there are of course deeper"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72 T—Th Mftfiff DflttffiTh\u0017ft\u0016fi Bftft\u0015 \u0014tt ff—Th Wft\u0017\u0013\u0012 related symbolic meanings as well (one having something to do with the Phil - osophical Male, Female, Offspring and the Theosophy of the Trinity...if you want to know any more than that, you will need to look it up yourself ). Writing of the significance of the Pythagorean Theorem to Freemasonry in general, this unnamed Masonic author states that “The 47th Problem of Euclid represents such a perfect symbol of Freemasonry... encompassing both art and science, that the simple knowledge of it demands a breathtaking awe to which we may only bow our heads in reverence at the perfection, the universality and the infinite wisdom of that which has been given to us by God.” 3 One really couldn’t put it any more strongly than that, and it’d be a waste of time to try. But before we leave Salomon’s Temple, it’d be negligent to fail to note the following: In the 1960s, Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey formed a group which later became the governing body of the church.

Choke on it “A s caustic and alkaline as Drano” is how EPA scientist Dr. Cate Jenkins described some of the dust at Ground Zero in a 2006 interview on CBS, claiming that EPA officials had known about the toxicity of the air and lied about it. On September 13, 2001, then-EPA head Christine Todd Whitman told reporters at Ground Zero, “We have not seen any reason—any readings that have indicated any health hazard.” And on September 18, Whitman told the public via press release, “We are very encouraged that the results from our monitoring of air-quality and drinking-water conditions in both New York and near the Pentagon show that the public in these areas is not being exposed to excessive levels of asbestos or other harmful substances,” and that “given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York ... that their air is safe to breathe and the water is safe to drink.” Time magazine’s 2001 “Person of the Year” Rudy Giuliani echoed this assessment, claiming shortly after the attacks that “the problems created...are not health-threatening” and that “the air quality is safe and acceptable.” Yet, an August 2003 report by the Office of the Inspector General of the EPA said the Bush administration pressured the EPA to remove cautionary information from statements about the air quality at Ground Zero. Language used to describe excessive amounts of asbestos in the area was altered drastically to minimize the dangers it posed. Described by one air pollution expert as “wildly toxic,” the thousands of tons of dust and debris from the collapsed towers contained more than 2,500 contaminants, included asbestos, lead, mercury and a range of carcinogens, as well as other substances that can trigger kidney, heart, liver and nervous system deterioration. Back to Work The Giuliani administration seized control of the cleanup operation from federal agencies and subsequently failed to enforce federal requirements requiring use of respirators, simultaneously threatening companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed. New York Committee for Occu- pational Safety and Health industrial hygienist David Newman said, “I was down there watching people working without respirators.” He continued, “Others took off their respirators to eat. It was a surreal, ridiculous, unacceptable situation.” Critics assert that government officials—notably Bush, Whitman, and Giuliani—down- played health risks and rushed to reopen the area around Ground Zero, although this posed a grave danger to emergency personnel and cleanup workers. Subsequent investigations would suggest that the Bush administration pressured Whitman and Giuliani to provide reassurances ostensibly in order to allow Wall Street to resume business-as-usual. It is certainly worth noting that on September 12, 2001, Christie Whitman issued a memo directing that “All statements to the media should be cleared through the NSC (National Secu- rity Council in the White House) before they are released,” and that the following sentence was added by White House officials to a September 16 EPA news release: “Our tests show that it is safe for New Yorkers to go back to work in New York’s financial district.” A Legacy of Misery Several square miles were blanketed by the fine dust resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers, dust which, as previously noted, contained asbestos fibers from pulverized fire-proof- ing material as well as numerous other contaminants. An ever-increasing number of first re - sponders (reportedly as high as 70% for this group), recovery workers and members of the public are developing debilitating illnesses, serious respiratory ailments in particular. Some es- timates indicate that as many as 70,000 people might have long term health problems due to the dust. Hundreds of rescue workers are now on “permanent respiratory disability,” and there are ongoing concerns regarding negative effects on fetal development. Hell of a price to pay just to make a buck...but, then again, maybe all this misery was not just “collateral damage” but rather a desired outcome, adding to the purposefully-inflicted suf- fering and death on 9/11 itself and in the wars that followed."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN Epilogue: Over But Not Finished W ith the close of Act Six, the production mercifully comes to an end, and although the show may be over, there will be spin-offs (“Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego Osama bin Laden?”) and reruns (A gazillion 9/11 History Channel-National Geographic-Discov - ery Channel documentaries and counting) for years to follow.

On a profound level, the numerical combination 9/11 has become synonymous with “terror” over the last decade. Given the scope and scale of the Global MegaRitual and the mind-numb - ing level of planning that obviously went into scripting the occult aspects of the event, it is of far more than passing interest to note that, in the thirty years prior to 9/11, 9-1-1 had become the universal code in the United States for “emergency.” In light of all else that has been revealed, and the supreme importance of numbers in this megaritual, it strains credibility to suggest that this is mere co - incidence. Other than being an “engineered synchronicity” designed to make people do a double-take and scratch their heads before falling back into a me- dia-induced trance, though, what would the purpose be?

Yet, there’s a deeper level still... That Old Black Magic I n his book Numbers: Their Occult Power and Mys- tic Virtues , William Wynn Wescott writes that the number nine holds great significance among many secret societies. “The number nine is the number of the earth under evil influences,” he states. Our con- stant companion in the exploration of this megaritu- al, Aleister Crowley, concurs with Wynn, revealing in Gematria : “9. Most Evil, because of its stability. AVB, witchcraft, the false moon of the sorceress.” Yet, as with many occult matters, the meaning of the number nine is multi-layered. Crowley continues in Gematria , “9. The Ennead, Stability in Change.” The Ennead (derived from Greek, meaning the nine) is a grouping of nine related deities, most often used in the context of Egyptian mythology, including Osiris, Isis and Set, whose lineage and functions were arranged and explained by the theologians of Heliopolis. As three threes, the number was considered of great carnal power, and the groupings of the nine gods were very significant. The term is also used to describe the great council of the gods as well as a collective term for all the gods. Nine, then, is not simply “most evil,” but further invokes deities of supreme importance to occultists. Eleven, as we already know, has a bit of an evil repu- tation in its own right, but, more importantly in this context, is “the number of Magick in itself,” and “the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon,” as well as “My number” according to Aleister Crowley, to whom the entire 9/11 MegaRitual is in part dedicated.

This is a branch found in most traditions of astrology in which a practitioner decides the most appropri - ate time for an event based on its “astrological auspiciousness.” The most com- monly used and distinctive form of election is the ephemeral election, which involves selecting a date based on the position of the celestial bodies in the sky at the moment of the event. The horoscope for any given moment shows the general trends, alignments, planetary strengths and weaknesses, etc., and whether success or failure is indicated. Astrology-speak sounds like absolute gobbledygook to most people, but many occultists swear by the use of astrology for their purposes. Saying, then, that on the day of the attacks “transiting Pluto was within seventeen minutes of an exact conjunction to the U.S. ascendant at 12 degrees Sagittarius” doesn’t mean jack-shit to most people, and fortunately we don’t have to figure out what this statement means. But we do have to push forward into the astrology of 9/11 and try to make some sense of it. The Lords of Death A pparently, astrologers, bless their hearts, had worried for months in ad- vance about the opposition of Saturn to Pluto that was in effect at the time of the attacks.

The god Pluto was known in both the Greek and Roman traditions as the ruler of the underworld, and became casually interchangeable with Satan as an embodiment of Hell. The planet of the same name is thus viewed as a fairly nasty character. Modern astrologers don’t find Saturn as evil as the more traditional astrol - ogers do, but “the stress between the restriction of Saturn and the transforma - tive power of Pluto can be difficult at best,” whatever the hell that means. One gathers that when these two guys get close to each other, it means something bad is going to happen. And on 9/11, where they had their con- frontation apparently wasn’t a good thing, either, as there was a “sensitive and critical placement of the Pluto/Saturn opposition,” with Pluto, “the planet of death/rebirth/transformation” in the 12th house, “which rules darkness, se- crets, imprisonment” and Saturn, “the planet of death and limitation” in the 7th house, “which rules our country’s relationship with others.” 1 The astrological interpretation, then, would go something like this: the two Lords of Death came too near each other in a couple of astrologi - cal houses that amplified their malevolent characters (or whatever), which made it a great day to sacrifice 3,000+ people to the Prince of Darkness (and I don’t mean Ozzy)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"85 TThtt Afiffffi—\u0019—\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0019 F—\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0015ff\u0017—\u0013fi —\u0011 ffThtt 9/11 Mtt\u0018\u0015ffi\u0017ff\u0014\u0015\u0019 Up Next A s bad as dealing with the Deadly Duo may have been, there’s still more as - trology to absorb—in fact, we haven’t even gotten to the best part yet.

Prometheus: the Original Torch-Bearer T he torch is an ancient symbol: in Greek mythology, the original “torch-bearer” was Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods in order to give it to humanity. Writing in The Secret Doctrine , it is again Blav - atsky who tells us of “the allegory of Prometheus, who steals the divine fire as to allow men to proceed consciously on the path of spiritual evolution, thus transforming the most perfect of animals on Earth into a potential god, and making him free to take the kingdom of heaven by violence.” She continues, “Hence also, the curse pronounced by Zeus against Prometheus, and by Jeho - vah against his ‘rebellious son,’ Satan.” Master Freemason Manly P. Hall makes similar observations in Lectures on Ancient Philosophy : “Man wandered hopelessly in the gloom of mortality, living and dying without light or understanding in his servitude to the Demiurgus and his host of spirits. At last the spirit of rebellion entered the creation in the form of Lucifer, who in the guise of a serpent tempted man to revolt against the mandates of Jehovah (the Demiurgus). In Greece this character was known as Prometheus, who brought from the gods the impregnating flame that would release the life latent in this multitude of germlike potentialities.”"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"89 S—fittTh Ofltt\u0019\u0018tttt\u0019 \u0017\u0016 \u0015tt 9/11 Mtt\u0014\u0013R— \u0012\u0013fi Identity “Decoded” B rad Meltzer’s investigative series, Decoded , which airs on the History Channel, devoted an entire episode in its 2010 season to the occult identity of the Statue of Lib - erty.

The last interviewee in the program reported that, indeed, the statue does represent Lucifer, but purely as light-bringer, as the illuminator and savior of humanity—asserting a non-existent uniformity of thought within the historical and contemporary occult communities. Again we hear, That Lucifer, he’s not such a bad guy after all. In reality, the Decoded investigative team demonstrated a truly profound ignorance of occult beliefs and traditions, and missed some of the most compelling evidence pointing to the statue’s true occult identity. A Powerful Luciferian Presence T here is in reality much evidence to support the contention that occultists view the Statue of Liberty as a representation of Lucifer—not exclusively so, to be sure, as there are also esoteric connections to Isis, among others. But in the final analysis there is little doubt that the deity invoked on 9/11 was Lu- cifer, and that the Statue of Liberty was intended to serve as a powerful mani - festation of the Luciferian Presence during the 9/11 Occult MegaRitual. In the end, though, the concept of Liberty is in fact applicable—but only in a very narrow sense. To the engineers of 9/11, liberty means the freedom to do whatever they wish, to whomever, when- ever they so desire. Liberty to them is freedom from all constraints, moral, legal and otherwise.

T he tablet held by the Statue of Liberty is inscribed in Roman numerals with July 4, 1776, which is widely recognized as the date of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The year 1776 is also the year that the Illuminati was founded; however, there is an even deeper significance behind the date on which our Independence Day falls, as we will soon discover. A Common Foundation T he cornerstone for the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty was laid in a Masonic ceremony on August 5, 1884; eighty two years later, on August 5, 1966, the groundbreaking ceremony for the World Trade Center was conducted. Was this merely a means employed to connect the two locations through time and space in preparation for the 9/11 MegaRitual? Or is there even more to the story? A Common Denominator T he birthday of the United States of America and the date inscribed on the Statue of Liberty’s tablet; the cornerstone laying for the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and the groundbreaking for the World Trade Center; the groundbreaking ceremony for the Pentagon and the attacks in New York and Arlington/Washington—why were these dates used by occultists in repeated fashion, and what do they have in common? The dates in question are all connected to the brightest object in the occult pantheon (as well as the brightest star in the night sky), Sirius, the Dog Star. “It would be difficult to exaggerate the fanatical degree of attachment the priest - hood of Egypt and all subsequent related Hermetic traditions had for Sirius,” writes Michael Hoffman in Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare . “The en- tire calendar year of the Egyptians was based upon the rising times of this star.”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"92 TThfi Mtt—ffi Dffftflfi\u0017tt\u0016— Btttt\u0015 \u0014ft ffiThfi Wtt\u0017\u0013\u0012 Indeed, Sirius was of unique importance to the Egyptians, and is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. During the Middle Kingdom, Egyptians based their calendar on Sirius’ heliacal rising, the date on which a star or other celestial body first becomes visible above the eastern horizon just before sun- rise after a period of being absent from view. In ancient Egypt, Sirius’ heliacal rising originally occurred just before the annual flooding of the Nile River and the summer solstice, after a 70-day absence from the skies. 1 Sirius in Antiquity T he Greeks and Romans knew Sirius well. Writing in the Iliad , Homer, the greatest ancient Greek epic poet, said this concerning Sirius: Sirius rises late in the dark, liquid sky On summer nights, star of stars, Orion’s Dog they call it, brightest Of all, but an evil portent, bringing heat And fevers to suffering humanity. Homer elaborates, referring to Sirius as the star “whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train.” 2 Sirius is part of the constellation Canis Major, which Roman myth referred to as Janitor Lethaeus, the watchdog of Hell. Canis Major (Latin for ‘greater dog’) is one of the dogs following Orion the hunter, and Sirius is recognized as the dog’s nose. “An evil portent,” the nose of the watchdog of Hell—now there’s a pretty bad historical reputation. The Blazing Star S irius occupies a unique position in more contemporary occult thought, as well. Writing in Morals and Dogma concerning the preeminence of the star within Freemasonry, Albert Pike states, “The Ancient Astronomers saw all the great Symbols of Masonry in the Stars. Sirius glitters in our lodges as the Blazing Star.” He continues: In Freemasonry, it is taught that the Blazing Star is a sym- bol of deity, of omnipresence (the Creator is present every - where) and of omniscience (the Creator sees and knows all)."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"93 CThfifitt—ffifffift Tfltt D\u0017ffitt\u0016: A Sff\u0015ff\u0014\u0016 A\u0013\u0013\u0017ff\u0015 Sirius is therefore the “sacred place” all Masons must ascend to: It is the source of divine power and the destination of divine individuals. To achieve perfection, the initiate must successfully understand and internalize the dual nature of the world (good and evil; masculine and feminine; black and white, etc.) through alchemical metamorphosis. This concept is symbolically represented by the union of Osiris and Isis (the male and female principles) to give birth to Horus, the star- child, the Christ-like figure, the perfected man of Freemasonry—who is equated with the Blazing Star. Here, again in Morals and Dogma , Pike reiterates the last point: “The sun and moon ... represent the two grand principles ... the male and the female ... both shed their light upon their offspring, the blazing star, or Horus.” Elsewhere in the book, Pike states, “[The Blazing Star] originally represented SIRIUS, or the Dog-star, the forerunner of the inundation of the Nile; ...It was HER- MES, also, the Master of Learning, whose name in Greek is that of the God Mercury.” Writing in her Theosophical Glossary , Helena Blavatsky records a similar obser - vation: The dog-star: the star worshipped in Egypt and reverenced by the Oc - cultists; by the former because its heliacal rising with the Sun was a sign of the beneficient inundation of the Nile, and by the latter because it is mysteriously associated with Toth-Hermes, god of wisdom, and Mercu- ry, in another form. Thus Sothis-Sirius had, and still has, a mystic and direct influence over the whole living heaven, and is connected with al - most every god and goddess. Sirius, the Freemasonic Blazing Star, their ‘sacred place’, equated with the perfected man, Horus; yet, also representing Thoth-Hermes-Mercury, exercis - ing “a mystic and direct influence over the whole living heaven.” However, as many are aware, there are various levels within Freemasonry, and there is often more to a story than first meets the eye.

Hermes, the god of wisdom, called also Thoth, Tat, Set, Set, and Sat-an; and that he was, furthermore, when viewed under his bad aspect, Typhon, the Egyptian Satan, who was also Set.” The plot thickens... The “Silver Star” of Aleister Crowley and others S irius was called the “Argentinium Astrum,” or Silver Star, by the Masons and Rosicrucians, and in 1907, Aleister Crowley started his own occult order, called the A:.A:.. Brit - ish occultist, novelist and poet Kenneth Grant met Aleister Crowley in 1944 and was initiated into the A:.A:. in 1946. In his book, The Magical Revival , Grant writes, First and foremost is the energy or force emanat - ing from the sun Sirius. If it might be so expressed, the energy of thought, or mind force, in its totality, reaches the solar system from a distant cosmic centre via Sirius. Sirius acts as the transmitter, or the focalising centre, whence emanate those influences which produce self-consciousness in man. But in his 1973 book, Aleister Crowley & the Hidden God , Grant provides a decidedly different perspective, informing us that “The Silver Star (A:.A:.) is Sirius. ...the key to the present aeon of Horus, for it represents the energy of Satan that will permeate the earth during the present cycle.” Ah, yes, the energy of Satan ... Sirius, then, according to sources ranging from Homer to Crowleyite Grant, is a fairly nasty character, a fact that others will readily attest to. The Devil of Darkness, the Dwelling of Lucifer I n her 1971 book, Woman’s Mysteries: Ancient and Modern , New Age author M. Esther Harding states that Sirius is portrayed by Black Magick Satanists as the “Devil of Darkness” and the “Lord of the Underworld.” In addition to this sinister characterization of Sirius, Christian author Texe Marrs reveals that Sirius is also viewed as the dwelling of Lucifer, stating in his 1990 Book of New Age Cults and Religions : “Throughout the centuries, Sirius has been recognized by most occultists and esoteric teachers as the location where Lucifer and his hierarchy dwell. In Christian terminology, Sirius is sim- ply a secretive codeword for ‘hell’.”"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"95 CThfifitt—ffifffift Tfltt D\u0017ffitt\u0016: A Sff\u0015ff\u0014\u0016 A\u0013\u0013\u0017ff\u0015 A Sirius Affair S o now we’ve come to it...Although certainly not viewed as purely evil by all cultures and esoteric traditions, it has been well established that a considerable consensus exists across a broad spectrum of occult thought regarding Sirius’ malign influence. At this point in the examination of the occult script for the 9/11 MegaRitu- al, it would be safe to assume that the orchestrators of the event were, to put it mildly, intently focused upon Sirius’ negative aspects. Confirming this suspicion, the late James Shelby Downard argues in “Sorcery, Sex, Assassination, and the Science of Symbolism” that a Sirius cult exists today at the high - est levels of US military intelligence. D ownard goes so far as to say that the viewing chamber of the Palomar Observatory is used for its rituals, which evoke those of ancient Egypt, and are performed in the star’s fo - cused light. 3 But how, exactly, does this re - late to Independence Day, the Twin T owers, the Pentagon and the Stat - ue of Liberty/Lucifer?

More of Sirius in Antiquity: Hesiod, Virgil, Statius and Manilius on the Dog Star “Their souls passed beneath the earth and went down into the house of Haides; but their bones, when the skin is rotted about them, crumble away on the dark earth under parch- ing Seirios.” —Hesiod, Shield of Heracles “And now Sirius (the Dog Star), fiercely parch- ing the thirsty Indians, was ablaze in heav - en, and the fiery Sun had consumed half his course; the grass was withering and the hol- low streams, in their parched throats, were scorched and baked by the rays down to the slime.” —Virgil, Georgics 2 “Twas the season when the vault of heaven bends its most scorching heat upon the earth, and Sirius the Dog-star smitten by Hyperion’s [the sun’s] full might pitilessly burns the pant- ing fields.” —Statius, Silvae 3.1.5 (trans. Mozley) “The brilliant constellation of the Dog: it barks forth flame, raves with its fire, and doubles the burning heat of the Sun. When it put its torch to the earth and discharges its rays, the earth foresees its conflagration and tastes its ulti- mate fate. Neptune lies motionless in the midst of his waters and the green blood is drained from leaves and grass. All living things seek alien climes and the world looks for another world to repair to; beset by temperatures too great to bear, nature is afflicted with a sickness of its own making, alive, but on a funeral-pyre: such is the heat diffused among the constella- tions, and everything is brought to a halt by a single star. When the Dogstar rises over the rim of the sea, which at its birth not even the flood of Ocean can quench, it will fashion unbridled spirits and impetuous hearts; it will bestow on its sons billows of anger, and draw upon them the hatred and fear of the whole populace. —Manilius, Astronomica"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Chapter Fifteen New Year’s Day and the Malevolent Mega-Talismans 9/11—Happy New Year! T he Egyptians’ New Year was originally marked by the first dawn rising of Sirius, which at that time occurred in June on the summer solstice. However, over time the heliacal rising of Sirius drifted forward from the solstice. Today’s Coptic calendar (also called the Alexandrian calendar) is based on the ancient Egyptian calendar and is still used in Egypt, and also by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The first month of the year is named Thout, after Thoth, and thus the first day of the New Year is the 1st of Thout. On the Gregorian calendar, this date coincides with September 11th—so that date is not only New Year’s Day, but, more importantly, it is the symbolic, or observed, date of Sirius’ heliacal rising. (September 11 = 1/1; yet another 11, of sorts.) We already know Thoth as the Egyptian God of Magic and as the pre- cursor/counterpart to the Greek God of Commerce, Hermes—with the pair having jointly played key roles thusfar in the MegaRitual—yet Thoth was also known as “the reckoner of times and seasons,” a god of the measurement and regulation of events and of time itself. Thoth was credited with making the calculations for the establishment of the heavens and everything in them, and was said to direct the motions of the heavenly bodies. Thus, the entire 9/11 Global MegaRitual unfolded on the first day of the New Year on a calendar derived from the ancient Egyptian calendar, in a month named for Thoth, the Egyptian God of Time (the full significance of which will be made clear soon)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"98 Tfift MTh—tt Dff\u0019\u0018ft\u0017Th\u0016— BThTh\u0015 \u0014\u0019 ttfift WTh\u0017\u0013\u0012 Even more significantly from an occult perspective, this date is tied direct - ly to Sirius in a most powerful fashion, with the intent being to bring the entire day’s events under the dark energies of Sirius, and to invoke the blessings of Lucifer, who resides there. However, the utilization of this malign occult strategy wasn’t confined to September 11, 2001... Magical Elections T alismans represent the logical extension of a spiritual world view and have been a part of Western culture for thousands of years. Renaissance Magi like Marsilio Ficino and Cornelius Agrippa saw the entire Cosmos as one great, interconnected Be- ing, a system based on intricate harmony, sympathy and corre- spondence, both spiritual and material. Astrology, alchemy and magic were seen as the preparatory studies for Hermetic Gno - sis, a practical way of experiencing the unity of the Cosmos. 1 Talisman comes from the Greek telesma , meaning consecrated or sacred object, and unless a talisman is created at an astrologically auspicious time and ritually consecrated, it is nothing more than a piece of jewelry with astrological designs, lacking any magical or spiritual charge. The key to astrological talismans, then, is the timing of their creation as determined by electional astrology. Although astrology is not inherently con- nected with magic, ephemeral elections have been used in ancient and modern times to make talismans and seals (in such instances, the term “magical elec - tions” is used). These items are seen to be imbued with the qualities of the auspi- cious date on which they are made... 2 A rmed with this last little bit of information, let’s revisit two dates: July 4th, and August 5th. The Fourth of July “C onjunction” is a term used in positional astronomy and astrology, and means that, from a particular geographic location (say, New York, for instance), two celestial bodies appear near one another in the sky. In the mod - ern era, the date on which Sirius conjuncts with the Sun, which esoterically is considered the embrace of our physical and spiritual Suns, is ... July 4th. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty’s tablet is not, then, simply a reference to the founding of America (or even of the Illuminati), but, far more importantly, is an encoded tribute to Sirius."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"99 Nfift YfiTh—’tt DThff Th\u0019\u0018 \u0017\u0016fi MTh\u0015fi\u0014\u0013\u0015fi\u0019\u0017 Mfi\u0012Th-TTh\u0015\u0011tt\u0010Th\u0019tt August 5th I f 9/11 is the observed date of Sirius’ heliacal rising, then the date of the “initi - ation” of both the Statue of Liberty and the Twin Towers corresponds with... wait for it...the actual date of Sirius’ heliacal rising. Writing in Secret Chamber: The Quest for the Hall of Records , researcher Robert Bauval notes, “Precession has since caused that date to shift 45 days, and now the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs on the 5th August.” (August 5 = 8/5...Flight 85...just sayin’) Malevolent MegaTalismans S eptember 11th, July 4th, August 5th—all directly connected with the abode of Lucifer—and we now see that the Statue of Liberty, the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were all intended to be imbued with the seething en- ergies of Sirius/Lucifer—and are/were, in effect, malevolent MegaTalismans. Work on the Pentagon mega-talisman started on September 11th, and then the structure was attacked on that very same day exactly 60 years later in an act of synergetic magickal destruction saturated with Sirian/Luciferian energies. In similar fashion, the August 5th commencement date for the Statue of Lucifer and the Twin Towers mega-talismans brought them under the spell of the Silver Star, with the towers being born on 8/5 and destroyed on 9/11 under the watchful eye (and torch) of the Illuminated One. Indeed, marked with both August 5th and July 4th, we can be doubly as - sured that our beloved Statue of Liberty has a dual identity, and that its hidden occult persona is that of none other than Lucifer. Best Wishes I n light of the significance of August 5th, you have to wonder if the following widely-known quote from President George W. Bush—taken from remarks he made in Washington, D.C., on August 5th, 2004—is just another Bushism, or perhaps something much more intentional and deliberately spoken: “Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.” Making the comment even more compelling is that he was reading closely from prepared remarks when he made it, during a speech at the signing ceremony for a $417 billion defense spending bill (The Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005). Interesting, too, is that no one in the audience of military brass or Pentagon chiefs reacted in the slightest. Maybe Bush wasn’t quite the bumbler everyone thought he was, and maybe he meant it when he said in 2009: “I’m telling you there’s an enemy that would like to attack America, Americans, again. There just is. That’s the reality of the world. And I wish him all the very best.”"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Chapter Sixteen Are You Sirius?

(It’s also the name of a 1972 New Age hippie film starring rock legend Jimi Hendrix.) The rainbow bridge, also called the Antahkarana, can refer to this internal connection, or to the bridge between Heaven and Earth—which, apparently, is still under construction—and some New Age spiritualists believe that Sirius is a major guiding force in the building of this bridge between worlds. One could, then, draw the conclusion that those inclined to do so, such as the occult scripters of 9/11, would pervert the concept and envision the building of a Rainbow Bridge to Lucifer (and you’d be correct).

Yet, the Twin Towers were not merely imbued from their beginning with evil energies, or trans - formed through astrological and magickal means into symbolic, then literal, Gates of Hell.

Dr. Cathy Burns, writing in Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated , illuminates us as to the significance of this fact: “Mythologist Joseph Campbell reminds us that the ‘trefoil or trident is the symbol of Shiva, Poseidon, Satan’. The Trident is also a fire symbol.” Indeed, in Christian iconography, the trident is the weapon of the Devil. It might come as a surprise to some, but that’s not a pitchfork ol’ Pip is carry - ing—and the Twin MegaTalismans were literally wrapped in a Satanic sym- bol.

If the capstone could in a positive sense represent the transformation of the initiate into a perfected being, under a more sinister interpretation the unfinished pyramid represents the mass of humanity, as “a rough and unfinished block...taken from the quarry and by the secret culture"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"111 A Mfi——Thttfl Cflftfl\u0019\u0018\u0017Thfi\u0016 C\u0018\u0019\u0015\u0016fl\u0014 of the Mysteries gradually transformed” into their image of perfection—into a posthuman, transhuman collective hive awaiting the bidding of its masters. The orchestrators of 9/11 would not have had a utopian vision of the physical and spiritual evolution of mankind in mind. To them, the unfinished pyramid infers an artificially-accelerated, technologically-and-pharmacologi - cally-induced synthetic evolution of humanity, directed by their hand for their own nefarious purposes. The 9/11 MegaRitual was indeed part of that very process, one designed to utilize fear and terror to force the transmutation of human society, of our very consciousness, individual and collective. The Stepped and Square Pyramids P yramids are viewed as “stairways to heaven,” symbolic stairways to the stars, and the stepped pyramid of the World Financial Center might well represent a Stairway to the occult-Masonic heaven, Sirius. The square pyramid is symbolic of a mountain, with its corners repre- senting the four corners of the world and the four cardinal directions. More significantly, it is a path between Heaven and Earth, with its peak rising into the sky. In occult lore, the pyramid is considered to be the ultimate symbol of the Mysteries, representing the transition from the material plane to the spiritual world. From the square base of the pyramid, representing the ma- terial world, rises—in mathematical perfection—four triangles, represent - ing divinity.

Albert Pike, writing in Morals and Dogma , concurs, stating that “The more the great Hierophants were at pains to conceal their absolute Science, the more they sought to add grandeur to and multiply its symbols. The huge pyramids, with their triangular sides of elevation and square bases, represented their Metaphysics, founded upon the knowledge of Nature.” There may be no singly-important meaning of the pyramid in this context, as it is “the ultimate symbol of the Mysteries.” For certain, it rep - resents the path of illumination, and we have well seen that the inspired s ource of illumination from the perspective of the 9/11 script writers is the Light-Bearer, Lucifer. The Dome L ast but certainly not least, the dome is often associated with both Isis and Sirius, and is in fact a component of the hieroglyph for Sirius. The image invoked is of a womb, birthing a new humanity, giving rise to a new aeon, Aleis - ter Crowley’s Aeon of Horus. Interpreting the Complex T he Twin Towers were sacrificial altars or vessels, and were themselves ‘sacrificed’ as part of the 9/11 MegaRitual. The mass human sacrifice and the destruction of the sacrificial vessels (recalling the burning of the Wicker Man) were performed in the presence of these four over-sized occult symbols—each of which bears its own significance and meaning. More than one of these symbols invokes the Blazing Star, Sirius, and it is also possible that these four symbols together constitute a coherent occult statement. Perhaps they are a three-dimensional explication of what could well be the ultimate goal of the MegaRitual itself: the transmutation of human consciousness through fear and terror.

The Palladian Rite A lbert Pike, who lived from 1809 to 1891, was a prominent Freemason and author of Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry . Pike was elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite’s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859, a position he held for the remainder of his life. Pike was also reportedly the Grand Master of an organization known as the Order of the New and Reformed Palladian Rite, which was a resurrected version of an earlier group founded in Paris in the 1700s called the Order of the Palladium. According to legend, the Order had been brought to Greece from Egypt by Pythagoras in the fifth century, and it was said that this “cult of Satan” was aligned with the Palladium of the Templars and introduced to the inner circle of the Masonic lodges. Pike’s Palladium Rite was said to be an international Luciferian alliance of key Masons, and in her book, Hidden Secrets of the Eastern Star , Dr. Cathy Burns writes, Knowing of Pike’s admiration for Lucifer, we shouldn’t be astonished to find out that Pike created a Palladium Rite which was a secret rite that openly worshipped Lucifer and practiced blatant occultism. This rite was to be kept secret at all costs and only a chosen few were selected. The Palladium, we are told, would be an international alliance of key Masons. It would bring in the Grand Lodges, the Grand Orient, the 97 degrees of Memphiz-Mitzraim (the Ancient and Primitive Rite) and the Scottish Rite. The name, Palladium, was taken from a Masonic order founded in 1720 which died out, only to re-emerge in Charleston under Pike. The Palladian Rite was to be a supreme, universal rite of Masonry that would over-arch all of the other rites, and centralize all high Masonic bodies in the world under one head, that head being Lucifer with Pike as his human agent. The “H” Word A s described, the Palladian Rite certainly sounds like a logical suspect on which to pin the blame for the 9/11 Global Occult Monstrosity.

Man, that fits the bill—that’s it, cased closed, get the torches and pitchforks. There’s just one problem. Pike’s Palladian Rite probably doesn’t even exist, and was almost certainly a hoax perpetrated by one Léo Taxil (originally Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès). Taxil, a French writer and journalist, wrote a series of pamphlets and books in the 1890s denouncing Freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshipping the devil—which, as it turned out, was only one of a series of hoaxes he’d concocted. The ultimate truth of the matter may be more complicated than that, and just because Taxil’s writings may have been a hoax, doesn’t mean there’s not a Luciferian core at the heart of Freemasonry—but good luck proving it. Re- gardless, our next suspect, although it may be a familiar one to some, certainly warrants closer scrutiny in light of what we’ve learned about the 9/11 occult framework.

In fact, the entire secret society revolves around death-centered imagery. The initiates are told that they must ‘die to the barbarian world’ and be born again in the company of the elect or, as they call it, The Order.” Whitehead also tells us that, Some critics point to the fact that Skull and Bones is similar to other powerful secret societies such as the Thule Society, which emerged in Germany in the early 20th century. Much like its modern counterpart Skull and Bones, the German Thule Society initiated its members with elaborate rituals that mimic those of black magic—replete with sexual practices, blood orgies and communicating with spirits such as the devil. And, in fact, both groups use identical symbols to identify their respec - tive group—the nefarious skull with two crossed bones. Skull & Bones is a regular fea - ture in many conspiracy theories, some of which assert that the so - ciety plays a key role in a global ca - bal bent on world domination. It has been alleged, for example, that the society—informally referred to as “Bones” (and its members as “Bonesmen”)—is a branch of the Illuminati and controls the Cen- tral Intelligence Agency. 1 “Bone smen are like a cross be- tween Forrest Gump and Zelig,” writes Washington Post Staff Writ - er Don Oldenburg in a 2004 arti - cle, “always in the picture at major historical crossroads: Bonesmen oversaw development of the atom- ic bomb and influenced the deci - sion to use it on Japan.

They love to point out that statues of the patriot spy Nathan Hale, Yale 1773, stand on both the university’s campus and the CIA’s headquarters in Langley.” John Whitehead adds further detail: “Known for its celebrity membership, Skull and Bones’ alumni include numerous power-wielding individuals such as former President William Howard Taft, Henry Luce—the founder of Time magazine, U.S. Supreme Court justices, mega-corporation founders and lead - ers and such recent luminaries as former President George H.W.

Writing in the May 2000 issue of the Atlantic maga - zine, Alexandra Robbins states, Bush men have been Yale men and Bonesmen for generations. Prescott Bush, George W ’s grandfather, Yale ‘17, was a legendary Bonesman; he was a member of the band that stole for the society what became one of its most treasured artifacts: a skull that was said to be that of the Apache chief Geronimo. 2 Prescott Bush, one of a great many Bonesmen who went on to lives of power and renown, became a U.S. senator. George Herbert Walker Bush, George W.’s father, Yale ‘48, was also a Bones - man, and he, too, made a conspicuous success of him- self. Inside the temple on High Street hang paintings of some of Skull and Bones’s more illustrious members; the painting of George Bush, the most recently installed, is five feet high.

Maybe George W. Bush himself provided a partial answer of sorts to this question when he remarked in 2008, “I’ll be long gone before some smart per - son ever figures out what happened inside this Oval Office.” Or, perhaps Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez was more on target than anyone realized in a 2006 address to the United Nations General Assembly when he made the following remark con- cerning President Bush’s presence there the day before (and then made the sign of the cross, brought his hands together as if in prayer and glanced toward the ceiling): El diablo está en casa.

The number of magic is everywhere, including an 11-year countdown to 9/11 (see next chapter), and the entire MegaRitual takes place “in plain sight.” (For another humorous overview of the events of 9/11, see Appendix D on page 181.)"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Chapter Twenty-Two Two Final 11s, and the Question of Time “Boy, they were big on crematoriums, weren’t they?” —President George H.W.

W. Bush in an ad - dress to a joint session of Congress on September 11, 1990, in which he referenced the “new world order” that 9/11 would be highly instru- mental in bringing about: We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge: a new era—freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.

The occult script proves the existence of a massive conspiracy beyond a shadow of a doubt. Exactly who did it is another matter, and exactly how they did it yet another still. And while the former question remains open and screams for further investigation, the latter—how—doesn’t matter any - more (except in determining who-all’s asses to execute or put in jail). The ugly truth is that the conspirators could have done—and did—any - thing and everything they wanted to. Bringing down two skyscrapers under our noses? Child’s play, easily enough accomplished from a technical perspec - tive, however it was done. The beautiful truth, however, is that we can now basically ignore all the pesky little details because we can see the big picture. The apparently-fireproof jet-fuel-soaked passport of one of the Twin Tow - ers hijackers that supposedly survived the crash and was found on the ground by a passerby? Who cares. Mohamed Atta’s luggage—reportedly containing the 9/11 hijackers’ names, assignments and al-Qaeda connections—which conve- niently failed to make it onto his plane and not only allowed the FBI to quickly identify the hijackers but also amounted to “the Rosetta stone of the investiga - tion”? Who cares. The airline passenger manifests that strangely didn’t include any of the hijackers’ names? Who cares. The Bush family member on the board of directors of Securacom/Stratesec, the company that provided security for the World Trade Center and Dulles Airport? Who cares. The power outages in the towers in the weeks leading up to the attacks? Who cares. The presence of nan- othermite in the dust at Ground Zero and the discovery of pools of still-molten steel more than a month after 9/11? Fuhgedaboud-it. To use a slightly modified cliché, Don’t miss the MegaRitual for the burning buildings. A Total Fabrication I n the context of the occult script, all of the inconsistencies, suspicious facts and blatant lies make perfect sense—it was a huge multi-faceted operation involving so many different working parts that the conspirators never expected to be able to cover it all up, or even cared about doing so. In many instances, they didn’t even try, or, worse still, were so bold and arrogant that they mocked us to our faces by leaving clues in plain sight."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"137 T—tt Rttfi PThflfl All of the maddeningly suspicious details and inconsistent official accounts that merely left us confused and befuddled now lose their power over us. In context of the MegaRitual, we see that it was all theatre. In many instances, they didn’t even attempt to hide their stagecraft, because they know we can’t see something that we don’t believe exists. We can now explain why everything about 9/11 seemed suspicious—the entire event was engineered and the entire official story is a fabrication. Every official explanation for every aspect of 9/11 is now suspect, and, in fact, we can and should assume that the official explanation for every single element of 9/11 is a falsehood. But what can we do about it, against unseen actors with practically omnip - otent power? Is it even possible to hold such people accountable—are they not untouchable? With certain knowledge of conspiracy, we must act, and Michael Hoffman tells us why: if we don’t, we enable our own enslavement. The Hoffman Lens H offman reminds us of the purpose of the 9/11 MegaRitual: “This theater of death began as a ritual for the cult members themselves and ended as a giant magical ceremony for the processing of the entire nation... This is the al - chemical psychodrama for the transformation of humanity. We are processed just by reading or watching ‘the news.’” 1 Hoffman continues, The French adept Antonin Artaud, architect of the “Theater of Cruel - ty” with its transformative power, and the prophet of the extreme sex- and-death media of our time, had this to say about the processing of the Group Mind: “Aside from trifling witchcraft of country sorcerers, there are tricks of global hoodoo in which all alerted consciousness - es participate periodically...That is how strange forces are aroused and transported to the astral vault, to that dark dome which is composed above all of...the poisonous aggressive- ness of the evil minds of most people...the formidable tentac - ular oppression of a kind of civic magic which will soon appear undisguised.” “... which will soon appear undisguised.” Artaud wrote those words in the 1940s. The public sorcery he forecast is here, now."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"138 T—tt MfiThfl Dffiftfftt\u0017fi\u0016Th Bfifi\u0015 \u0014ft fl—tt Wfi\u0017\u0013\u0012 Theater of death, global hoodoo, civic magic, public sorcery... “What we are witnessing in the wake of the public enactment of these alchemical psycho - dramas,” writes Hoffman, “whose spiritual consequences for mankind are far more momentous than most have thus far guessed, is a process of global occult initiation. These are open-air masonic ceremonies which produce awe in the wake of the physical and technical accomplishment of their time-lost objec - tives.” 2 A lchemical psychodrama, global occult initiation, open-air masonic cer - emony—the 9/11 Global Occult MegaRitual was all of these, and more. But the secrets contained therein, the “secrets of the script,” were not meant to be kept secret forever. Hoffman describes how the occult secrets buried within the rituals are meant to be revealed eventually, and calls this ... “the Revelation of the Method”...the process wherein murderous deeds and hair-raising conspiracies involving wars, revolutions, decap - itations, secret archaeo-astronomic deity cult-worship, and every man- ner of horror show are first buried beneath a cloak of secrecy...and then, when finally accomplished and secured, slowly revealed to the unsus - pecting populace who watch...deep-frozen...as the hidden history is unveiled. 3 Hoffman explains the Method further, and reveals its purposes: The alchemical principle of the Revelation of the Method has as its chief component, a clown-like, grinning mockery of the victim(s) as a show of power and macabre arrogance. When this is performed in a veiled man- ner, accompanied by certain occult signs and symbolic words and elicits no meaningful response of opposition or resistance from the target(s), it is one of the most efficacious techniques of psychological warfare and mind-rape. This ceremonial nose-thumbing, this perverse jesting and clowning is taken to the highest level of intensity by the Truth or Consequences principle which ultimately hinges upon the issue of consent. It is one thing for the media, the police, the judiciary and the killers themselves to commit terrible acts without our knowledge or consent. It is quite another matter, with grave repercussions in the realm of psy - chodrama, public ritual and advanced mind control, when these crimes are committed with our consent. It is an ancient rule of both the moral"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"139 T—tt Rttfi PThflfl and common law that silence connotes consent—silence and a lack of meaningful action constitute consent in the face of these crimes.

This is exactly what we found throughout the 9/11 MegaRitu- al script, and now we must face the conclusion that the conspirators in fact wanted us to eventually discover what they’d done. Hoffman shares further insight into the Revelation of the Method, and ex - plains the “game plan operant”: ...the after-the-fact revelations are as much a part of the...plot as the murder and its initial cover-up. It’s a deliberate psychological process they’re taking us through, a psychodrama of enormous scale. 5 ... The following is a statement which comes from within the British-intelli - gence wing of the Cryptocracy: This demonstrates one of our simpler methods. Realizing that our activities will sooner or later come to light, we structure our activities so that as conspiracy researchers unravel them, they will release information into the public consciousness in such a way that it mirrors our initiatory procedure. In this way, the more we are investigated, the more masses of people are psychologically processed by the very people who seek to ex - pose us. The meme that constitutes our essential structure is then successfully mimicked within the consciousness of those who investigate us. Success can then be measured precisely to the extent that our work is “exposed.” ...the one-two punch repeatedly conveyed in these highly symbolic murders, which transmit alchemical cant language command phrases and trigger-words over the airwaves and into the news racks. One: the ritual murders are successfully accomplished. The principals get away, the scapegoat conveniently takes the blame. Two: later we learn the truth but no one is prosecuted.

That is the game plan operant here. Enabling Our Enslavement S o, is that all we’re doing here, is this all we’ve accomplished: spreading the tale of their immunity and invincibility? Hoffman goes on to discuss the motive behind the Method, and reminds us that ““silence and a lack of mean- ingful action constitute consent in the face of these crimes.” And the conse- quences of consent?... Why would the perpetrators want their secrets revealed after the fact— even if it is years later? ...secrets like this were rarely revealed in the past because traditional people had not yet completed the alchemical pro - cessing. To make such perverse, modern revelations to an unprocessed, healthy and vigorous population possessed of will, memory, adherence to their deepest inner intuition and intense interest in their own salva - tion...

Hoffman reiterates, repeating that con- sent is key: If the truth of what the cryptocracy has perpetrated is grasped and acted upon, the consequences for the conspirators will be annihilation. But if the people fail to perceive the truth or fail to act on their perception, thus rendering unto the Process a kind of tacit consent born of apathy, amne- sia and abulia, the consequence for the conspirators will be a giant step in the advancement of their system of control, that is to say, ever tighter bonds of enslavement for humanity.

Again, it’s Michael Hoffman guiding us through the maze: “Aleister Crow - ley, in a statement to OTO initiates concerning one of his books, describes the underlying epistemology behind the glamour and enchantment which causes the occult con-game to become the weird reality we inhabit in America today: ‘In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist.

Often called Druj (“the Lie”), Ahriman was the force behind anger, greed, envy, and other negative and harmful emotions. He also brought chaos, death, disease, and other ills into the world. In the Islamic religion, he is identified with Iblis, the devil. 1 Ahriman is the all-destroying Satan, the source of all evil in the world. Rudolph Steiner, the initiator of the anthroposophy movement, has published detailed and elaborate studies on the Zoroastrian Ahriman. He claims that Ahriman and the Hebrew demon Mephistopheles can be considered as the same spiritual entities, with the biblical demons Mammon and Beelzebub as his associates. Ahriman’s as - signment is to alienate humanity from its sp iritual roots and to inspire materialism and heartless technical control. As such, his influence is highly relevant to pres - ent-day Western culture. 2 A hriman’s acolytes seek a kind of “immortality” in the slag-earth-sur - rounded-with-Old-Moon-forces, but an immortality with egotistic, earthly con- sciousness instead of the cosmic con- sciousness of the individualized spiritual Ego.

Sigils A sigil (lat. sigillum, diminutive of signum, “sign”) is a symbol designed for a specific magical purpose. They are designed to represent a glyph, com- posed of a variety of symbols or concepts with the intent and inherent iconic meaning. Essentially, sigils are symbolic icons that are condensed representa - tions of more complex ideas or information. A sigil may have an abstract, pictorial or semi-abstract form. It may appear in any medium, physical or virtual, or only in the mind. Visual symbols are the most popular form, but the use of audial and tactile symbols in magick is not unknown. 1 “9/11” is not technically a sigil, in that it is not purely a symbolic icon (it can be read at “face value”)—unless you consider numbers themselves as symbols and assign ultimate importance to the character of these symbols. 9 is evil and 11 is magic; further, the 11 simultaneously represents the Pillars of Hermes and the Twin Towers.

Mount Carmel is west of US77, and only a short distance to the east of the roadway is Crawford, Texas. George Bush’s Prairie Chapel Ranch is located seven miles northwest of Crawford and was acquired by Bush in 1999. In case you were wondering, April 19 is a Satanic holy-day, requiring sac - rifice by fire, most preferably involving the sacrifice of children, and, indeed, multiple children perished in both Waco (more than 20) and Oklahoma City (19 under the age of 6). So, to summarize, in this instance we have three sepa - rate geographic locations, physically connected by a roadway bearing the num- ber 77, and also linked by a highly-important occult date—on which, in two of those locations, mass ritual sacrifices appear to have been performed (if you’ve never examined the suspicious circumstances surrounding both the OK City bombing and the Waco massacre, you should). We would do well to remember Michael Hoffman’s wisdom on this point: “Mystical toponomy and alchemical cant language are part of a process which hinges on a marriage between action in time [or recorded history] and physical locations on the earth regarded as ‘places of power’ by the cryptocracy’s mag - ical-geographical vision of the earth as a giant chess board, symbolized by the tessellated floor of Solomon’s Temple and the masonic lodge.” Mr. 77 A pparently the Bushes have a great affinity for the number 77 (or it has a great affinity for them, or both). The USS George H.W. Bush is the U.S. Navy’s tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier, and Bush’s daughter Dorothy Bush Koch was the ship’s sponsor. The ship’s designation is CVN- 77.

This verse reads, 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. The verse is commonly referred to—by Thelemites—as “R P Stoval” after the last group of letters. No one knows what it means, although many have claimed to decode the enigmatic phrase. A photograph found at Ruth Paine’s home—a photograph of a ’57 Chevrolet in the driveway of General Walker, the man Oswald is sup - posed to have fired upon and missed in the weeks leading up to the as - sassination—was mutilated. The license plate had been removed from the photo so that it would be impossible to identify. The Dallas detec - tive who seized the photo from the Paine home and put it into evidence claimed that it was already mutilated; Marina Oswald denied this and later evidence—a photo of the photo, to be precise—shows that Ma - rina was telling the truth. The photograph when it came into custody of the Dallas police was intact; someone in the department must have chopped the license number out of the picture. The Dallas police detective who confiscated the photo and who subse- quently lied by stating that it arrived in his possession in its mutilated state was one R . B. Stoval. In addition, Oswald worked for a photographic firm in Dallas that had Defense Department contracts: Jaggers-Chiles-Stovall. The job had been arranged for Oswald by George de Mohrenschildt. In de Mohrenschildt’s entire existence, as with so much else surround - ing Oswald, we seem to be looking at a kind of voodoo. —Dick Russell, The Man Who Knew Too Much Is any of this data meaningful in a forensic sense?

The conspiracists further claim that these globalists planned 9/11 and used it to further their NWO agenda, to implement key components of their strategy for global domination by: facilitating wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; decreasing civil liberties through the enactment of the Patriot Act; and enabling the de- velopment of a domestic police state and massive new domestic surveillance infrastructure (the Washington Post did a major investigation and published a series of articles on this infrastructure, which include numerous “threat fusion centers” and so on); etc. The Wikipedia entry for the New World Order reads in part: In conspiracy theory, the term New World Order or NWO refers to the emergence of a totalitarian one-world government. The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive pow - er elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which replaces sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda that ideologizes its establishment as the culmination of history’s progress. Significant oc - currences in politics and finance are speculated to be orchestrated by an unduly influential cabal operating through many front organizations. Numerous historical and current events are seen as steps in an on-going plot to achieve world domination through secret political gatherings and decision-making processes."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"164 TTh— Mfiflff Dtt ft—ffifi\u0016fl Bfifi\u0015 \u0014 ffTh— Wfiffi\u0013\u0012 In his book Psychological Warfare and the New World Order , Servando Gonzalez describes the NWO as “... a sort of neo-feudalism incorporating some characteristics of total - itarian fascist and communist regimes as well as modern techniques of mass mind control. ...

Most of them are members of the Council on Foreign Relations or some of its parasite organizations like the Trilateral Commission, the United Nations...the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, just to mention a few. The Illuminati M any conspiracy theorists believe that a group called the Illuminati is be- hind the push for a New World Order. Again, from Wikipedia: The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus , “enlightened”) is a name given to several groups, both real (historical) and fictitious. Histori - cally the name refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. In more modern contexts the name refers to a purported conspiratorial organization which is alleged to mastermind events and controls world affairs through governments and corporations to establish a New World Order. In this context the Illuminati are usually represented as a modern version or continuation of the Bavarian Illuminati. It’s hard not to be at least a tad suspicious of the group, given the following quote attributed to Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt: “By this plan we shall direct all mankind. In this manner, and by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames [emphasis added]. The occupations must be so allotted and contrived, that we may, in secret, influence all political transactions.” Some researchers assert that not only are the Illuminati incredibly secre- tive and powerful, but also inherently evil. In The Illuminati Conspiracy Against God , Henry Makow writes: The Illuminati consist of the Jesuits and some of the world’s richest families, including the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers and the Windsors. While they pay lip service to religion, they worship Lucifer. Their agents"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"165 AThTh—fiflfftt A: T — Uftffi\u0016\u0015 SffiftTh—\u0014\u0013ft control the world’s media, education, business and politics. These agents may think they are only pursuing success, but success literally means serving the devil. Prisoners of their wealth, the Illuminati prefer hatred and destruction to Love... They pretend to be moral while working be- hind the scenes to degrade and enslave humanity in a “new world order.” Hiroshima, Dresden, Auschwitz, Cambodia and Rwanda were sacrifices to their god Lucifer. They are responsible for the two World Wars, the Depression and the Cold War. Sept. 11, the War on Terror and the Iraq War are their latest achievements. The Freemasons F reemasons are a standard fixture in New World Order conspiracy theories, and are often associated with the Illuminati. The Wikipedia entry reads: Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation that arose from obscure or - igins in the late 16th to early 17th century. Freemasonry now exists in v arious forms all over the world, with a membership estimated at around six million, including approximately 150,000 under the juris - dictions of the Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland, o ver a quarter of a million under the jurisdiction of the United Grand Lodge of England and just under two million in the United States. ... Conspiracy theorists have long associated Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organization is either bent on world domination or already secretly in control of world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically extreme right (e.g. Nazi Germany) and the extreme left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe). Stephen Knight, in his book, Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution , gives us the following very compelling insight: Freemasons applaud violence, terror and crime providing it is carried out in a crafty manner. One section of the (masonic) notes says humor is all-important and the most appalling crimes may be committed under its cloak...ghoulish murders with a Puckish sense of fun. If Masonic su- premacy appears in jeopardy, it is re-established by a show of strength, by crimes of violence, perpetrated to demonstrate... the far-reaching power of Freemasonry to initiates the world over."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"166 TTh— Mfiflff Dtt ft—ffifi\u0016fl Bfifi\u0015 \u0014 ffTh— Wfiffi\u0013\u0012 And writing on Infowars.com, Mark Dice observes: It is often doubted that the Illuminati are still operating within the cover of Freemasonry. It is often dismissed that any kind of “inner circle” exists with - in Freemasonry, but Manly P. Hall, one of Freemasonry’s greatest philoso - phers and recognized as such by the official magazine of Scottish Rite Free - masonry, wrote in his book, Lectures on Ancient Philosophy on page 433, that, “Freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity—an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood of the elect...the visible society is a splendid camaraderie of ‘free and accepted’ men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical, educational, fraternal, patriotic, and humanitarian concerns. The invisible society is a secret most august fraternity whose members are dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcanum arcano - rum (secret of secrets.)” The “Bible” of Freemasonry, Morals and Dogma , written by Albert Pike, explains Masonic philosophy, and is read primarily only by dedicated Freema - sons. Part of this philosophy, Pike explains, is, Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Al - chemy, conceals [emphasis in original] its secrets from all except the Ad- epts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpre- tations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be mislead; to conceal the Truth, which it [the Mason] calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) T he CFR and its members make frequent appearances in NWO conspir - acy theories. “The Council,” reads Wikipedia, “has been the subject of debate...partly due to the number of high-ranking government officials (along with world business leaders and prominent media figures) in its membership, its secrecy clauses, and the large number of aspects of American foreign policy that its members have been involved with.” Former member of the FBI Headquarters staff Dan Smoot writes in The Invisible Government , I am convinced that the Council on Foreign Relations, together with a great number of other associated tax-exempt organizations, constitutes"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"167 AThTh—fiflfftt A: T — Uftffi\u0016\u0015 SffiftTh—\u0014\u0013ft the invisible government which set the major policies of the federal gov - ernment; exercises controlling influence on government officials who implement their policies; and, through massive and skillful propagan- da, influences Congress and the public to support its policies. I am con- vinced the objective of this invisible government is to convert America into a socialist state and make it a unit in a one-world socialist system. Carroll Quigley, in Tragedy and Hope , elaborates, writing, There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international An- glophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, has no aver - sion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and fre- quently does so.... The Council on Foreign Relations is the American Branch of this network ... and ... believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one-world rule established. And in Psychological Warfare and the New World Order , we find: In 1975, Admiral Chester Ward, a former Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Navy and a member of the CFR from 1959-1977 who broke with the organization, wrote that the CFR’s stated goal is the “submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful, one- world government.” Furthermore, Admiral Ward warned, “... this lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership.” The Rockefeller Brothers T he Rockefeller Brothers are by no means the only individuals implicated in the New World Order scheme, but they are certainly worthy of being singled out for special attention. David Rockefeller was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1970 to 1985 and the founder of the Trilateral Commission. In his 2002 auto - biography Memoirs , he writes, For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the polit - ical spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents...to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.

If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it. And in an address to the Trilateral Commission in 1991, David Rockefeller stated: We are grateful to the Washington Post , the New York Times , Time mag - azine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected the promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world-government. The supranational sovereignty of an intel - lectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the National auto - determination practiced in past centuries. Peter Levenda, writing in his book Sinister Forces: A Grimoire of American Polit- ical Witchcraft , shares the following: In 1976, Congressman Larry P. McDonald pointed to the true source of the conspiracy: The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies [is] to create a one-world gov - ernment combining super capitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control....the Rockefellers and their allies have, for at least fifty years, been carefully following a plan to use their economic pow - er to gain political control, first of America, and then the rest of the world.

The new American Revolution has not used (at least, not yet) rifles and cannons to enforce its rule, but stealth, cunning, deception, lies and psychological warfare. The ideology of the new American revolutionaries who conspire behind our backs to impose it upon the rest of us is a mixture of fascism and communism, which they euphemistically call the New World Order. However, the techniques they are using to implement it are not the ones preferred by Fascists or Communists, but have been copied from the British Fabians and the Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci. The British Fabians advocated communism as conceived by Karl Marx, but contrary to Marx, Lenin, Trotsky and other Communist ideo - logues, they believed that the right way to do it was gradually, by infiltra - tion, capturing the existing institutions from inside and putting them to work for their goals. Writing in their article “9/11, Psychological Warfare & the American Narra - tive,” authors Elizabeth Gould and Paul Fitzgerald share insights that are par - ticularly compelling in context of the discussions in this book: The creation of the World Trade Towers by Rockefeller brothers Nelson and David had been steeped in psychological symbolism from their start in the early 1960s. As the most well known scions of American business, the Rockefeller family brought more than just money to their endeavors, they brought a vision for the future of the planet and a philosophy to guide it. Begun as a massive undertaking to revitalize lower Manhattan, Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David and New York Governor Nelson pushed hard for the project and each tower stood as a symbol of their respective power. As metaphor, the towers were more than just two of the tallest buildings in the world. It might be said they were as important as the two pillars Joachim and Boaz which stood at the entrance to Solo - mon’s Temple; mystical gates to a Cathedral of wisdom in which all could worship under one religion; the reli - gion of business, Capitalism. The Rockefellers were no strangers to the power of psychological warfare and its impact on American opin- ion.

It also serves to stimulate the compulsive urges of man’s base ap - petites, and a plethora of mundane and dissonant drives that conflict with our higher aspirations and intentions.

They transmit archetypal ideas that words are unable to convey.

The Nazis openly used ritual choreography, ancient symbols and rallying chants, powerful mystical logos and regalia, and so on, to force men into a hive mentality. We now know that Hitler and his cronies were deeply involved with powerful occult societies and were fascinated by ancient mysticism.

He reports his find - ings in his book Welcome to Terrorland: Mohamed Atta & the 9-11 Cover-up in Florida . As well as describing evidence of large-scale illegal activity going on in and around the Venice Airport, this book casts serious doubt upon the official account of who the hijackers really were. We have all heard how these 19 alleged hijackers were Islamic extremists. Yet evidence uncovered by Hopsicker, particularly regarding alleged ring - leader Mohamed Atta, depicts unlikely personalities and lifestyles for a bunch of religious fanatics. For example, almost totally ignored by the mainstream press is that Atta had an American girlfriend for over two months whilst in Venice, with whom he would go out clubbing almost every night. At the time, this at - tractive young woman—Amanda Keller—had spiky pink hair and was working as a “lingerie model” for an escort service called Fantasies & Lace. Atta is known to have been a heavy drinker who snorted cocaine. Local newspapers reported how in February 2001, along with Keller, he went on a three-day binge of drinking and drug taking in Key West."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"176 Tttfl Mffftfi Dffi—Thfl\u0017ff\u0016ft Bffff\u0015 \u0014— fittfl Wff\u0017\u0013\u0012 Just days before 9/11, Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi (another of the alleged suicide-pilots) spent the evening drinking heavily at a bar in Fort Lauderdale. The bar’s manager later told reporters that the men “got wasted,” drinking “Stolichnaya and orange juice, and Captain Morgan’s spiced rum and Coke.” Bartender Patricia Idrissi concurred, saying: “Atta drank Stoli vodka for three straight hours. They were wasted.” Amanda Keller describes a typical night out at a club with Atta: “Marwan [al-Shehhi] was in the reggae room drinking with a bunch of women at the bar, there were a lot of women around him, and he was just flaunting money.” As Hopsicker points out: “It’s one thing to hear Atta described as living it up with wine, women and song. But Marwan flaunting money at the bar pretty much puts the lie to the ‘Islamic fundamentalist’ tag.” Hopsicker suggests that, rather than being a fundamentalist Muslim, Mo - hamed Atta better fits the profile of a member of Arab society’s privileged elite and also a spy. Amongst many oddities contradicting the ‘fundamentalist’ label is the fact that his e-mail list included the names of several employees of U.S. defense contractors. More alarming, he and as many as six of the other alleged 9/11 hijackers appear to have trained at U.S. military bases. Hopsicker writes: “On the Saturday following the Tuesday attack, the Los Angeles Times broke the story in a long article on their front page. “A defense official said two of the hijackers were former Saudi fighter pi - lots,” reported the paper, “who had studied in exchange programs at the De- fense Language School at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas and the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.” The story went wide the next day, Sunday, September 15th. Newsweek , the Washington Post and the Miami Herald all reported as many as seven of the ter - rorist hijackers in the September 11th attacks received training at secure U.S. military installations. “Two of 19 suspects named by the FBI, Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmed Al - ghamdi, have the same names as men listed at a housing facility for foreign mil - itary trainees at Pensacola. Two others, Hamza Alghamdi and Ahmed Alnami, have names similar to individuals listed in public records as using the same address inside the base,” the Washington Post reported. “In addition, a man named Saeed Alghamdi graduated from the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, while men with the same names as two other hijackers, Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari, appear as graduates of the U.S. International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, respectively,” the Post said."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"177 AttttflffftfiffiC: T—fl MTh—\u0017\u0016flft A\u0015\u0017 M\u0014\u0013— Newsweek detailed how U.S. military facilities routinely trained pilots for oth - er countries: “A former Navy pilot told Newweek th at during his years on the base, ‘we always, always, always trained other countries’ pilots. Whoever the country du jour is, that’s whose pilots we train.’ Candidates begin with ‘an officer’s equiv - alent of boot camp,’ he said. ‘Then they would put them through flight training.’” Hopsicker explains how this crucial story came to be dismissed: “Someone was going to have to answer for a lot. “But Atta is a fairly common surname in the Middle East,” the Post quot - ed Laila Alquatami of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee as saying, and the suspected hijacker’s first name is “probably the No. 1 name that is given to babies, in honor of the prophet Mohamed.” The Boston Globe reported the Pentagon’s denial: “Some of the FBI sus - pects had names similar to those used by foreign alumni of U.S. military cours - es,” said the Air Force in a statement. “Discrepancies in their biographical data indicate we are probably not talking about the same people.” How easy was it to tell the Pentagon was lying? Think about it. It is neither plausible nor logical that the reports were false because of seven separate cases of mistaken identity. One or two, maybe. But seven? No way. None of the newspapers retracted the story, yet it disappeared. One per - son who sought answers was Senator Bill Nelson, who faxed Attorney General John Ashcroft, demanding to know if the story was really true. However: “The Senator has still not received a reply, we heard from his spokesman, when we called his office eleven months later. “In the wake of those reports, we asked about the Pensacola Naval Air Sta - tion but we never got a definitive answer from the Justice Department,” stated the Senator’s press spokesman. “So we asked the FBI for an answer ‘if and when’ they could provide us one. Their response to date has been that they are trying to sort through some- thing complicated and difficult.” Deciding to investigate for himself, Hopsicker phoned the Pentagon and spoke with the public information officer who helped write and disseminate their original denial of the story: “Biographically, they’re not the same people,” she explained patiently, us - ing the same language contained in the Air Force’s press release. “Some of the ages are twenty years off.” Was she saying that the age of the ‘Mohamed Atta’ who had attended the Air Force’s International Officer’s School at Maxwell Air Force Base was differ - ent than that of ‘terrorist ringleader Mohamed Atta?’"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"178 Tttfl Mffftfi Dffi—Thfl\u0017ff\u0016ft Bffff\u0015 \u0014— fittfl Wff\u0017\u0013\u0012 Not exactly, she admitted. She could not confirm that—in this specific in- stance—they had different ages. What she could do was once again deny that the International Officer’s School attendee named Mohamed Atta had been the Mohamed Atta who piloted a passenger plane into the World Trade Center. However, she could offer no specifics for her assertion, and repeatedly declined requests for biographical details about the Mohamed Atta who had trained at Maxwell Air Force Base. After Hopsicker’s persistent questioning, she finally said in exasperation: “I do not have the authority to tell you who attended which schools.” Hopsicker reflects: “It was hard to read this as anything other than a back-handed confir - mation. When she said that she didn’t have the authority, the clear implication was that someone else does? Somewhere in the Defense Dept. a list exists with the names of Sept. 11 terrorists who received training at U.S. military facilities. She just didn’t have the authority to release it.” Furthermore, Hopsicker spoke to a woman who works at the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama: “I have a girlfriend who recognized Mohamed Atta. She met him at a party at the Officer’s Club,” she told us. “The reason she swears it was him here is because she didn’t just meet him and say hello. After she met him she went around and introduced him to the people that were with her. So she knows it was him.” Saudis were a highly visible presence at Maxwell Air Force Base, she said. “There were a lot of them living in an upscale complex in Montgomery. They had to get all of them out of here. “They were all gone the day after the attack.” Despite it being a key 9/11 crime scene, there has been a surprising ab - sence of investigations into the goings on in Venice, Florida. In fact, to the con- trary, “the FBI’s full attention seemed to have been engaged—not in investigat - ing what had happened—but in suppressing evidence and even intimidating the witnesses who had seen and heard things that fly in the face of the ‘official story.’” For example, Mohamed Atta’s former girlfriend Amanda Keller says that even after she left Venice, the FBI called on her every other day for several months, telling her not to talk to anybody. Similarly, a woman called Stephanie Frederickson who lived next-door to Atta and Keller in Venice reported how she and other residents at the same apartment building were harassed and in- timidated by FBI agents, to prevent them from talking to reporters. According to Frederickson: “The question [the FBI] asked was always the same. You aren’t saying any - thing to anybody, are you?"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"179 AttttflffftfiffiC: T—fl MTh—\u0017\u0016flft A\u0015\u0017 M\u0014\u0013— “At first, right after the attack, they told me I must have been mistaken in my identification. Or they would insinuate that I was lying. Finally they stopped trying to get me to change my story, and just stopped by once a week to make sure I hadn’t been talking to anyone.” What is more, the FBI arrived in Venice just hours after the 9/11 attacks. A former manager from Huffman Aviation said: “They were outside my house four hours after the attack.” He added: “My phones have been bugged, they still are. How did the FBI get here so soon? Ask yourself: How’d they get here so soon?” Within 24 hours of the attacks, records from Huffman Aviation, where Atta and al-Shehhi attended, were escorted aboard a C-130 cargo plane to Washington by Florida governor and brother of the president Jeb Bush. Similarly, according to a sergeant with the Venice police, the FBI took all their files and flew them to Washington with Jeb Bush aboard. (Presumably this was on the same flight as the Huffman records.) Hopsicker notes: “The import - ant point was that taking files was a lot different than copying them. The FBI wasn’t taking any chances.” He concludes: “There is a demonstrable, provable, and massive federally-supervised cover-up in place in Florida.” As this and my previous evidence shows, there are countless unanswered questions about 9/11 that at some point are going to have to be properly ex - amined. Even an investigation into just a few of these questions, such as those around the war games on 9/11, could be enough to start a major scandal. However, as numerous writers and independent researchers have found, there are so many suspicious circumstances that the truth could be very different to what we have been led to believe. The human rights lawyer Richard Falk has written: “There are so many gaping holes in the official accounts of 9/11 that no plausible coherent narrative remains, and until now we have been stagger - ing forward as if the truth about these traumatic events no longer mattered.” But if the mainstream press start investigating properly, it could lead to a com- pletely unprecedented ‘9/11 scandal.’"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Appendix D: 9/11: A Conspiracy Theory (A Satire) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98&feature=colike Uploaded by corbettreport on Sep 11, 2011 T RANSCRIPT: On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with box - cutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world usin g a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.

It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance.” Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imag - ination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” ex - cept the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO. The DI A destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it prob - ably wasn’t important. The S EC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading be - fore the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investiga - tion in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.

Then, at 9:03, Flight 175 slammed into the 78th floor of the South Tower just below the 84th floor where Euro Brokers were located. Brian Clark, the manager at Euro Brokers, heard numerous explosions, appar - ently unrelated to what he referred to as the oxygen-starved fire caused by the plane crash. The September 11 attacks related to the financial improprieties during the preceding ten years which spurred at least nine federal investigations which were initiated in 1997-1998, about the same time that Osama bin Laden, after twenty years as a CIA asset, announced a fatwa against the U.S. The records of many of those investigations were held in the Buildings Six and Seven and on the 23rd floor of the North Tower. ... Building Seven, not hit by a plane, collapsed at 5:20 p.m. but was vacated as early as 9:00 when evacuees claimed to see dead bodies and sporadic fires within the building. By 2008 and even earlier the covert securities were worth trillions. The se- curities used to decimate the Soviets and end the Cold War were stored in cer - tain broker’s vaults in the World Trade Center where they were destroyed on September 11, 2001. They would have come due for settlement and clearing on September 12 , 2001. The federal agency investigating these bonds, the Of - fice of Naval Intelligence, was in the section of the Pentagon that was destroyed on September 11. Renovations at the Pentagon were due to be completed on September 16, 2001. However, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), the en- tity that often monitors war games, was hurriedly moved. If they were mon- itoring the simultaneous war games that morning, they would have realized that the games were used as a distraction from the actual assault. Whatever hit the pentagon struck the Navy Command Center and the offices of the Chief of Naval Operations Intelligence Plot (CNO-IP). There were 125 fatalities in the Pentagon; thirty-one percent of them were people who worked in the Naval Command Center, the location of the Office of Naval Intelligence. Thirty-nine of the forty people who worked in the Office of Naval Intelligence died. On September 10, 2001 Rumsfeld announced that the Pentagon couldn’t account for $2.3 trillion, “We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it’s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.” It was forgotten the following morning.

Prologue Are We There Yet? by Peter Levenda This is like no story of 2012 you have ever read. T he Mayans gave us the year 2012 as a deadline, a drop-dead date if you will. Now there has been a lot of mystification about 2012, an insistence that it signals the end of an era, or the end of the world. But we’ve been through this before. We had the Y2K phenomenon, when everyone “knew” that the computer systems of the world—including those running power grids, nuclear plants, and military defences—would go off-line at midnight on December 31, 1999/ January 1, 2000 to accompanying global chaos. It didn’t happen. And we have had generations of believers in various Christian denomina - tions believing that the world would end—and that Jesus would return—on all sorts of dates throughout the last two thousand years of history. Apocalyp - tic cults have been with us for centuries, and they always make for interesting reading. Of course, maybe the Rapture did happen and we are all that’s left. I wouldn’t be surprised. But why should we pay attention to the Mayans culture no one really knows very much about, and whatever they had to say about the end of their own calendar? The short answer is: we shouldn’t. After all, the Mayan End-of-the-World-2012 meme may be the most po - tent form of misdirection on the planet right now. It implies that if there is some kind of major disturbance in December 2012 that it was inevitable, that it was cosmic, that it was written in our stars.

The Mayan astronomers created their elaborate calendrical system—one of the most sophisticated in history—in the employ of the state. This was a time when church and state were one, as they have been for millenia of western and eastern history. We in the United States of America have grown up believ - ing that there is no crossover between these two institutions: that our political lives and our religious lives are separate and do not “bleed” over from one side to the other. That, of course, is nonsense. You don’t need to be a forensic ana - lyst with a can of Luminol to see that the blood is everywhere. While the legal separation of church and state—enshrined in our Consti - tution and most specifically in our Bill of Rights—is a fact, it is one of those things that looks better on paper than it does in real life. We live in one of the most spiritually frantic eras of all time, when abortion rights, gay marriage, and other “social” issues divide the country along what seem to be political lines but which are, in reality, purely religious boundaries. For instance, the arguments concerning abortion rights and gay marriage really boil down to the question of the soul and its relation to the human body: when does the soul enter the developing foetus? Does that make it a person? If gay people cannot procreate—and thus provide material basis for more souls—should their unions be blessed? Or even tolerated? But these are questions for philosophers, theologians and talk radio hosts. The manipulation of religious sentiments for political purposes is a mainstay of American life. We know that. But right now the survival of our individual human bodies may seem more immediately important than fuzzy theories about the na - ture of the soul, the spirit, or life after death. The New Age Mayan “prophecies” answer both needs, by framing human survival in almost mystical terms. The re- birth of the planet. The illumination of the masses. Cosmic consciousness. Which is not to say that some form of spiritual advice—some Kabbalah, for instance—would not be relevant (and welcome) to the matter at hand. Which brings us to this, the addendum to S.K. Bain’s Most Dangerous Book in t h e Wo r l d . It is, in a sense, the climax to the long build-up in volume one. It’s the punch line, but no one is laughing. Readers will be shocked at what Bain has to say about 2012. This has noth- ing to do with Mayan prophecy or Biblical millenialism, which are only win- dow-dressing for the actual event. It has everything to do with political events as mega-rituals, and with the conscious application of ritual technology to the manipulation of mass psychology. Isn’t that what the Mayans were all about? If the Mayan astronomers painted the veil in the millenial Temple full of stars, Bain’s book is about the Man Behind the Curtain.

I just hope that Bain is wrong. I pray that he is just another millenialist in a long tradition of millenialism, chiliastic panic and eschatological angst. But I have my doubts. Bain’s Konspiracy Kabbalah is internally consistent, and the numbers are infernally insistent. He knows that we are being worked up into some kind of fever over the end of 2012, with everything from History Channel documen- taries on aliens and ancient astronauts to New Age mystics and their groupies burning sage bundles in airless New York City apartments. Everyone is point - ing everywhere else ... except at where it matters. For if the world is coming to an end in 2012 do we have any doubt at all that the Powers That Be—that Free- masonry of fratricides, homicides and genocides—have already fueled their space shuttles and wire-transferred their Cayman Island account holdings to a Savings and Loan on Mars? More likely, according to Bain, they have orchestrated a magnificent tragedy for us to witness on the winter solstice, some cinematic devastation that will fin- ish what 9/11 only started. It will be an event replete with arcane symbols and ritual gestures, something that would make a semiotician blush with shame or lust: Earth-shattering explosions. Destruction of biblical proportions. Human sacrifice. Martial law. This is not a book for the nervous. It is, after all, the Most Dangerous Book in t h e Wo r l d . It should come with a warning, like a pack of cigarettes or an R-rated movie. But aren’t we tired of being protected by the state? Haven’t we finally realized that taking our shoes and belts off at airports is nothing more than theater? And isn’t the root of theater ritual itself? So throw caution to the radioactive winds. Open this book and start in. Unless, that is, you move your lips when you read. In which case close the book now. We don’t need another voice chanting the evocations that will bring Apocalypse even closer than the December 25, 2012 drop-dead date. And let the Powers That Be realize that Bain is on to you. He knows where the bodies will be buried. He has counted the numbers of the Beast—all of them— and has calculated the odds and hedged our bets with a view towards balancing the books.

Phoenix, Arizona. The unmarked white lor- ry-style delivery van traveled south down Interstate 17, taking the Cap - itol exit and then turning onto 17 th Street, again traveling south until it stopped directly in front of the Arizona State Capitol building at 1700 West Wash - ington Street. The driver sat motionless, eyes tightly closed, repeating “Allahu Ak- bar”—“God is Great”—over and over to the 9-1-1 operator... In Paradise Valley and in other communities all across the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix metropolitan area is often referred to, children and their parents were awakening to a beautiful Christmas morning. The sun had ris - en about forty-five minutes earlier and was slowly warming the crisp morning air. Children were unwrapping their presents, families anticipating a day full of gifts, fellowship and food—the joys of Christmas. Peace on earth and goodwill toward men. 8:15 a.m. The sun glinted off the circular stainless-steel band that was the primary element of Arizona’s 9/11 Memorial, situated in the park directly in front of the Capitol. Then, a brilliant instantaneous flash, appearing as a second sun, superheating the air around it. The fireball travelled outward at unimag - inable speed, incinerating almost everything in its path. Less than ten miles away, the windows at the Hall of Flame Fire Museum and the National Firefighting Hall of Heroes shook violently as the blastwave hit them and the intense light reflected off their tinted glass. The first new reports began to appear only minutes later on Fox and CNN, soon followed by footage from local stations showing the specter of nuclear terror realized, a mushroom cloud towering over a major American city. The nation, the world, was in a state of complete shock, far beyond any - thing experienced on 9/11. Some screamed in fear for loved ones in Phoenix, many sat stupefied staring at their televisions, repeating “Oh my God” again and again. Parents shouted at children to leave the room or clutched them close to comfort them."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"204 TftTh NThfi— 9/11? Those living in towns surrounding Phoenix could look out their windows and see the massive pillar of smoke rising into the sky.

There was no hope for those at ground zero ... in the surrounding blast zones, the horror was unspeakable: the suffocating heat, the smoke-filled air; the screams of the injured, the moans of the dying. Those nearest the blast who had survived and managed to make their way out of the burning build - ings couldn’t get their bearings—all familiar landmarks had disappeared. They wandered aimlessly in a choking sea of smoke, a literal hell on earth. Who would do this to America, on Christmas Day ? A Christmas to Forget A s the morning wore on, many couldn’t pull themselves away from the non-stop coverage of the disaster, while others were forced by emotional fatigue to turn away. When news anchors first began breaking in with other news alerts, many of those glued to their televisions initially thought, What the hell could be im- portant enough to interrupt this for?

It was becoming obvious to many that the terrible events of that morning were something new altogether—not simply a new 9/11 or a Mega-9/11, not simply a nuclear terrorist attack or a globally-coordinated attack—but a world - wide assault on Christendom itself. An attack on the United States and Israel, the Muslims’ “Great Satan” and “Little Satan,” as well as on the head of the Catholic church, God’s representative on earth to the faithful...an attack on one of Christianity’s holiest sites, on the most holy day of the year ... this was clearly the launch of an all-out Islamic jihad against Christianity.

Chapter Two Unholy War An Attractive Target A lthough not New York City or Washington, DC, Phoenix was certainly a logical and attractive terrorist target by any measure. The largest city in Arizona and the largest capital city in the nation, Phoenix was at the time of the attack the sixth most populous city in the United States, home to almost 1.5 million people according to the 2010 U.S. Census—the only state capital with over 1,000,000 residents. The Phoenix metropolitan area was the 14th largest in the nation by population, with about 4.2 million people in 2010, and Phoenix itself one of the largest cities in the U.S. by land area. (To top it all off, Phoenix is also the county seat of Maricopa County.) Arizona’s 389-mile-long border with Mexico had long made it a point-of- entry into the U.S. for illegal immigrants, drug runners and gangs, as well as terrorist organizations. Mexican gangs, including the notorious MS-13, had reportedly been cooperating with al Qaeda and Hezbollah in moving equip - ment and personnel across the border. With its resources stretched thin, the U.S. Border Patrol couldn’t begin to keep up with the ever-increasing volume of cross-border incursions. The Trigger T he immediate response to the attacks had been predictable for anyone who had access to the History Channel in the last decade: Americans had been fed a steady diet of programming on “continuity of government” and nuclear-disaster-response protocols. The declaration of emergency powers and martial law had come as a surprise only to those who had no idea what these phrases meant. A substantial number of Executive Orders put in place by President Obama and past Democratic and Republican administrations were invoked, and the majority of Americans welcomed these measures: Do any - thing, just keep us safe.

That’s what happens when you mess with America. After several months had passed and no additional attacks had occurred, one might have expected the usual calls for a full Congressional investigation. With the billions spent on increased intelligence gathering and threat analysis capabilities since 9/11, how could this have happened? There was no new 9/11 Commission, though, no Patriot Act II. They were unneeded. The government’s power was absolute, and it exercised that power fully. The apparatus of control that had been constructed in the wake of 9/11 had been so complete, so all-encompassing, all that was needed to bring this vast machinery to full power was a new and improved terrorist attack, and Phoenix was just that—the trigger that activated a massive engine of domination. The Official Story T he official government story was that, with the assistance of Irani - an-Guard-backed terror cells already in the U.S., al Qaeda and Hezbollah operatives smuggled a nuclear device containing Iranian-enriched uranium across the Arizona-Mexico border and transported it to Phoenix. There was no variation of Bush’s patently-absurd “We never imagined that terrorists would use planes as weapons,” no need for the President to say “We never imagined that terrorists would bring nuclear weapons across the Mex - ican border.” If 9/11 had been a failure of imagination, as it was repeatedly asserted, then Phoenix was a failure of intelligence—the government need - ed more information, more power, more authority and it needed it now. No questions asked, no excuses offered: If you want us to keep you safe, give us everything we demand, give us the rest of your freedoms. Despite the post-9/11 creation of the massive Department of Homeland Security, despite the numerous new threat fusion centers and hundreds of pri - vate corporations devoted to “national security”—chronicled in the Wa s h i n g - ton Post ’s 2010 investigative reporting series, “Top Secret America”—Phoenix happened. The problem was obviously not a lack of intelligence-gathering in- frastructure or analytical capacity, it was a lack of actionable information, a re- sult of too many protections of privacy and personal information.

There was no questioning it, this bedrock upon which old freedoms were sacrificed and new wars of righteous reprisal were launched. A new civic “religion” was born, this one much more powerful than the 9/11 Testament, the pages of which had worn thin and the masses had begun to question. Tens, hundreds of thousands of Americans had lost their lives in this vi - cious unprovoked attack rooted in religious hatred, hatred of the faith of our fathers. Doubting the government’s official story was far beyond unpatriotic, it was unChristian. There was no room in America for those who had any ques - tion about the justness of our cause and the rightness of our actions.

Chapter Three The New Ground Zero The People’s House: Sold (and Bought Back) T rying to look on the bright side (if there is such a thing in the wake of a nuclear terrorist attack), the destruction of the Arizona State Capitol buildings, all things considered, hadn’t been that much of a loss. The Old Capitol Building, which had been converted into a museum in the 1980s, had been built on the cheap in the first place and was one of the least impres - sive state capitols in the entire nation. Arizona was the last of the 48 contiguous states admitted to the Union; perhaps this had somehow dampened their en- thusiasm when it came to the construction of their capitol. The two identical Senate and House annexes that had been added in the ‘60s were the typical featureless architectural garbage common to the era, and were inadequate in practically every way. So little affection had lawmakers for the buildings that they in fact sold them in 2010 to raise money (under a 99- year lease-back arrangement)—only to turn around and consider buying them back 2 years later just in time for the state’s centennial celebration in 2012. (One supposes they figured that it’d be better to have a capitol that no one could be proud of than no capitol at all.) Although no one ever said as much, state officials, who had been looking at proposals for a new capital complex for some time, probably experienced somewhat the same sense of relief that Twin Towers owner Larry Silverstein felt upon realizing that he wouldn’t have to pay for costly asbestos remediation on the aging buildings. Yet Another Monumentally-Insulting Memorial T ruth be told, the annihilation of the Arizona 9/11 Memorial was no great loss, either. Like the original design for the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, initially entitled “The Crescent of Embrace” you might recall, the design of this memorial generated controversy from the very beginning. Some took offense to its distinctly crescent shape (sound famil - iar?), others to several of the self-flagellating blame America inscriptions, such"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"212 TttTh NThfiff 9/11? as “Foreign-born Americans afraid,” “You don’t win battles of terrorism with more battles,” and “Fear of foreigners.” Although she had no say in the final design, former Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano heartily endorsed the monument, stating, “ This Memorial is unique, bold, dynamic, educational and unforgettable. The thoughts and re- marks etched in stone will serve as learning tools for all of us, our children and our children’s children.” Or, maybe not. Aside from being offensive, the memorial was just plain ugly, although it did complement the plain-Jane Old Capitol in a weird sort of way. Viewed from above, the memorial looked like a big zero, which, in terms of its aesthet - ics, it certainly was. Ironically, it was as if this oversized symbol had somehow marked that spot as the next Ground Zero... Okay, here we go."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11?

They ’d done it, again, bigger and better, and the only thing that made the moment any more enjoyable was the certainty that they’d get away with it, again. For sure, 9/11 had changed the world, but it was simply preparation for this blow—Sep - tember 11, 2001 had merely been the warm-up routine for a really Big Show.

Don’t tell me that, I don’t want to know. For those who pick up on and manage to process the not-so-subtle hints, the message is abundantly clear: Yes, we did it, do what you’re told, or else. But most people simply lack the ability to grasp who they are dealing with: fantas - tically powerful psychopaths who view the vast bulk of humanity as a bunch of useless eaters, as sacrificial pawns to be disposed of at their pleasure, slain to honor the god of the week. Still Hiding in Plain Sight T he horror of the event—the sheer magnitude of the loss, suffering and terror—made a more elaborate public cover story completely unneces - sary. The elite programmers knew that the average citizen couldn’t see past the scenes of mass devastation to even begin to look for clues that didn’t fit into the official story, for the signs and symbols through which they communicate in plain sight—and take much pleasure in doing so. They had ruled the past decade with the spectre of a few passenger air - planes crashing into buildings and a couple of imploding skyscrapers—they would likely dominate the next half-century with the non-stop replay of imag- es of a mushroom cloud rising into the skies over American soil. The Occult Script for Black Christmas was in no danger of being exposed, least of all in any way that could pose any sort of serious threat to them. Even if some armchair-conspiracy-theorist jackass happened to piece together any part of it, what was he going to do? Put up a website? He’d be thrown in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp so quickly it’d make his head spin. Just like on 9/11, there was real destruction, there were real dead people, real Muslims (or at least Muslim-looking) involved—it didn’t matter who the actual producers of the show were, the production itself was reality, end of sto - ry...but not for us."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11?

Another Sirius affair. The Washington reference is not a coincidence, either, as our first President was himself a Freemason, and his own surprise attack on Christmas Day, at Trenton, New Jersey, is such a delicious historical connection that it’s difficult to put into words. The Trident Returns A pproaching Arizona’s capitol from the east, West Washington Street (be- fore it was vaporized) became part of a roadway configura - tion directly in front of the capital complex that was tantalizingly similar to a classic trident design—such as that found at Dealey Plaza in Dallas or encasing the Twin Towers—and although it fell short of the mark, one has to believe that the similarity sent a shiver up the spine of more than one globalist freakazoid. Such an important symbol would never be shortchanged in this fash- ion, though, and indeed the trident was employed in all its full glory in the weeks and months following Black Christmas. Arizona State University’s downtown Phoenix campus had been obliterated by the nuclear blast, and the Sun Devil Stadi - um—aptly named “The House of Heat”—located on the main campus at Tempe less than ten miles away, had become a primary triage point for the tens of thousands of wounded. ASU’s mascot, Sparky the Sun Devil, carries a trident, and the indelible image of this trident-toting imp became engrained in the public consciousness as the character was included in all manner of national and international media coverage surrounding Black Christmas. The icing on the cake was that the general public began using the hand sign for the trident—a tradition with fans of the school’s athletic teams—as a show of sympathy and support for the Sun Devils, and over time, this practice expanded and became a means of demonstrating support for the residents of Phoenix and the recovery effort in general, and rapidly exploded into a national phenomenon.

Americans of all walks of life flashed the sign en masse at events of every sort, from football games to Black Christmas fundraising concerts. Huge, shouting hordes of people, all over the nation, yelling patriotic slogans, chanting “USA, USA!” or “Phoenix will rise!,” all enthusiastically throwing the trident hand sign...to the occultists, these were scenes of incredible meaning and beauty, bringing a tear to the eye. A Real Shocker N ow, it’s not quite clear if this next aspect was somehow intentionally engi - neered as part of the MegaRitual, or just happened, a fortuitous byprod - uct of the elitists’ devotion to the black arts—perhaps a reward for being bad. As Americans are wont to do, many never paid too much attention to the details involved with forming the hand sign, with significant numbers of well-intentioned folk throwing around sloppy facsimiles. And it just so hap - pens that the trident hand sign is very, very similar to one called “the shocker” and known colloquially as “two in the pink, one in the stink.” To make the shocker, the thumb is used to fold the ring finger downward while the other fingers are extended, as with the trident. The only difference between the trident and the shocker is that with the latter, the index and mid - dle fingers are kept together and the back of the hand faces outwards, away from the gesturer. This gesture of course has a sexual connotation, referring to the act of inserting the index and middle fingers into the vagina and the lit - tle finger into the anus—hence the shock. (Alternate phrases that refer to the shocker include “two in the goo, one in the poo,” “two in the mush, one in the tush,” and “two in the gum one in the bum.”) An unfortunate percentage of Americans persisted in enthusiastically mis-forming the trident, with the result that at any given event, hundreds if not thousands of persons in the crowd would be unknowingly slinging around this pornographic hand gesture, with everyone else flashing the trident—the sign of the devil himself.

Now a nuclear blast isn’t good for anyone’s business, but the bar was well outside the secondary blast zone and hadn’t received that much actual damage. It certainly wasn’t a vital public service or critical to the proper functioning of the community (well, that would depend on who you asked).

Not only was this component of the occult script a tribute of sorts to the star of the 9/11 MegaRitual, Aleister Crowley, and his favorite sexual activity, which involved the “infernal entrance,” but obviously it was also a quite crafty means of repeatedly blasting out “Oz” to the entire planet—which, of course, further invokes Crowley, 77 and all the other crap.

Prior to that was the Arizona Broadway Theatre’s 2010 production of “Christmas in the Land of Oz” (the theatre itself being located at 7701 West Paradise Lane), and making his anticipated appearance in this latest MegaRitual is none other than our old pal Ozzy Osbourne, who held the very first Ozzfest in Phoenix in 1996.

In hindsight, it is plain to see the main characters and plotlines being es - tablished well in advance of the attack. The pre-programming/pre-scripting was everywhere, in fact, so obvious and brazen it’s amazing that we didn’t see it—right there, under our noses, just like in the lead-up to 9/11. The Politics of Fear P laying the lead female role was of course Janet Napolitano, head of the De- partment of Homeland Security (DHS), who was the governor of Arizona when President Obama tapped her for the position (and it must be said here at the outset that the notion of having the capital of the home state of the top dog at DHS play host to Black Christmas possesses an unmistakable twisted beauty). The creation of DHS in response to the attacks of Septem- ber 11th constituted the most significant government reor - ganization since the Cold War, and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Se- curity Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agen- cy. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies—including the U.S. Coast Guard and Secret Service—into a single organization."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"226 T—tt NttThfi 9/11? DHS is the third largest Cabinet depart - ment, with more than 200,000 employees and a fiscal year 2011 budget allocation of almost $100 billion, and its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. In addition to having served as Governor, Napolitano had been a lawyer (serving as attor - ney for Anita Hill) and Arizona’s Attorney Gen- eral, and in 1993 was appointed by President Bill Clinton as United States Attorney for the District of Arizona, in which capacity she was involved in an investigation connected with the Oklahoma City bombing. Despite having that level of experience, though, Napolitano, in retrospect, may not have been the best pick to head a massive federal agency whose single greatest responsibility and challenge was thwarting another major attack on the United States by Muslim extremists. From the outset, Napolitano seemed far more concerned about right-wing extremism (which in her opinion might well have been fueled by the election of the first African-American president) than Islamic terrorism. Worse still, displaying an almost insane politically-correct mindset, she even refused to use the word “terrorism,” telling the German news site “Spiegel Online” in a 2009 interview that she preferred the term “‘man-caused’ disasters.” She con- tinued, “That is perhaps only a nuance, but it demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.” 1 Move away from the politics of fear ...into the reality of a nuclear holocaust.

Despite having been governor of a state that borders Mexico and seeing first-hand the immediate and growing threats presented to national security by a porous southern border, in response to the above criticism Napolitano stated, “Nonetheless, to the extent that terrorists have come into our country or suspected or known terrorists have entered our country across a border, it’s been across the Canadian border.

We might also have been clued into Napolitano’s self-blinding and zealous adherence to the religion of radical political correctness by her actions as gover - nor of Arizona, where she: (as governor-elect) instituted interfaith prayer break - fasts before the start of every session; gracefully accepted the sprinkling of holy water from the Ganges on her forehead along with blessed garlands from Hare Krishna; stopped by to greet Hare Krishna devotees who were singing the Holy Names of the Lord during the Sankirtan in Phoenix; and, became the first-ever government official in the world to issue a proclamation for Krishna Janmashta - mi, the largest Hindu festival celebrating the appearance of Lord Krishna.

In an interview with CNN’s Can- dy Crowley (oh yeah, baby), Napolitano stated: What we are focused on is making sure that the air environment remains safe, that people are confident when they travel. And one thing I’d like to point out is that the system worked. Everybody played an important role here. The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action. Within literally an hour to 90 minutes of the incident occurring, all 128 flights in the air had been notified to take some special measures in light of what had occurred on the Northwest Airlines flight.

All the Rage “I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein,” John McCain used to joke about himself on the campaign trail. McCain was well known for his sense of humor, which sometimes went spectacularly awry, as with the following 1998 joke widely deemed unfit to print: “Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? Be- cause Janet Reno is her father.” Ouch. McCain was also known for his temper, profanity and fits of shouting, to the extent that long-time colleague Thad Cochran, senior U.S. Senator from Mississippi and a fellow Republi - can, once remarked about the possibil - ity of a McCain Presidency: “The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine.” Not wishing to be misunderstood, Cochran added, “He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.” Ouch. In his bid to become the Republican nominee in the 2000 Presidential contest, an anonymous smear campaign was initiated against McCain, de- livered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants.

Although George W. Bush’s campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks, McCain would say of the rumor spreaders, “I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.” (Not to worry, John, the Bushes already have reservations.) Unbelievable I f you wanted to create a character for a novel to serve as arch nemesis for the pre-ordained President of the World and champion of a state devastated by nuclear terrorist attack, you couldn’t invent a character like McCain—he’d be too unbelievable. The man is practically a real-life “Captain America.” McCain had been a ubiquitous presence inside the beltway—and a house- hold name—for decades, but especially so in the years leading up to Black Christmas, from his participation in the historic first Presidential Debate to in- clude an African American—fittingly held in Oxford, Mississippi, where Civ - il Rights hero James Meredith’s bid to enroll at the University of Mississippi resulted in riots and the mobilization of the National Guard—to the endless interviews following the Phoenix attack. In the wake of the national tragedy, Captain America McCain was every - where, much like Rudy “America’s Mayor” Giuliani after 9/11. But if anybody ever earned a role in a MegaRitual, it was McCain. American Hero A fter surviving a major conflagration on the USS Forestall that nearly cost him his life, John McCain was subsequently shot down and held as a pris - oner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years, two of those during which he was in solitary confinement. McCain turned down an offer of early release from captivity and suffered years of brutal torture as a result. McCain’s capture and resulting imprisonment began when his A-4E Sky - hawk was shot down over Hanoi. During ejection from the aircraft, both of McCain’s arms and one of his legs were fractured, and he nearly drowned after parachuting into Truc Bach Lake. The North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him before trans - porting him to the infamous “Hanoi Hilton.” Although he was badly wounded, McCain’s captors refused to treat his injuries, beating and interrogating him, only providing medical care after dis -"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"231 CttfiThttfl— Aftff fl\u0017tt covering that his father was a top U.S. admiral. McCain spent six weeks in the hospital receiving marginal care: entombed in a chest cast, he lost 50 pounds and his hair turned white. In December 1967, McCain was transferred to a different camp on the out - skirts of Hanoi, where he was placed in a cell with two other Americans who didn’t expect him to live out the week. Beginning in August 1968, McCain was subjected to a program of severe torture, forced to endure rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours—during this same time he was also suffer - ing from dysentery. His extensive injuries eventually led to a suicide attempt, and he later wrote, “I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.” McCain and other POWs cheered the 1972 “Christmas Bombing” cam- paign carried out by the US Seventh Air Force and US Navy Task Force 77 (yes 77), believing it to be an effective means of forcing North Vietnam to end the conflict. McCain was released in 1973. Listen, pal A fter returning to the states and settling in Phoenix, McCain went to work for Hensley & Co., his new father-in-law’s large Anheuser-Busch beer dis - tributorship. In 1982, McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizo - na’s 1st congressional district. A newcomer to the state, McCain was accused of being a carpetbagger. Responding to one voter making such an allegation, McCain replied with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist would later describe as “the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I’ve ever heard”: Listen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things.

Forget What I Said B efore becoming governor, Brewer was elected as Arizona’s Secretary of State, and prior to this she served in both the state’s House of Representa- tives and Senate. As state senator, she’d sought legislation to create an office of lieutenant governor, arguing that holding the office of Secretary of State does not qualify one to become governor, and that the office should be filled by a member of the same party, should a vacancy arise. Despite her earlier objec - tions to the line of succession, however, Republican Brewer was readily sworn in after Janet Napolitano resigned from her position to become Secretary of Homeland Security. (Brewer was elected to a full term in 2010.) Arizona v. United States T he “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act” (in- troduced as Arizona Senate Bill 1070 and referred to as SB 1070) was at the time of its passage in April 2010 the broadest and strictest anti-illegal im- migration measure in recent U.S. history, receiving national and international attention and sparking considerable controversy. Thousands of people staged protests in Phoenix after Governor Brewer signed the bill into law, with some calling the measure racist, and tens of thou- sands demonstrated against the law in over 70 U.S. cities on May 1, 2010, In- ternational Workers’ Day. (Some demonstrators, however, used the opportu- nity to express their frustration with what they saw as President Obama’s lack of action on immigration reform, carrying signs displaying messages such as, “Hey Obama! Don’t deport my mama.”) The legislation drew sharp criticism from civil rights groups, who assert - ed that it would encourage racial profiling. President Obama called the law “misguided” and warned that it could be applied in a “discriminatory fashion.” Obama’s Justice Department filed suit to stop the law from being implemented, which prompted a countersuit by Brewer, who alleged that the federal govern- ment had failed to protect her state from an “invasion” by illegal immigrants. As the Arizona Republic reported, The countersuit alleged that the federal government has failed to gain “operational control” of the border, is not enforcing federal immigration law, has not adequately reimbursed Arizona for more than $760 million in costs for the state to incarcerate illegal immigrants, and has tried to pre-empt the state from protecting its citizens by filing a lawsuit to halt the enactment of SB 1070."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"235 T—fi RThffffift ftttffiflTh Tfifl—\u0016ft ftttffi\u0015\u0014 Gft\u0013fi\u0012\u0016ft\u0012 The state asked the court to require the federal government to finish building 700 miles of fence along the U.S. border with Mexico, pro - vide enough federal immigration officers in Arizona to respond to local law-enforcement needs, allow Arizona to enforce federal immigration laws, and fully reimburse states for incarcerating criminal illegal immi - grants. Arizona also argued that because the federal government isn’t ade- quately enforcing immigration laws, the state incurs additional costs to provide public services such as education and health care. The countersuit was later dismissed and the matter eventually wound up at the Supreme Court in Arizona v. United States , where in late June 2012 three out of four provisions of the Arizonia law were held to be preempted by federal law. Sound Strike I n response to SB 1070, boycotts of various types were organized, includ - ing a boycott by various musicians called the Sound Strike, which failed to gain much support within the industry. Some musicians even opposed the boycott, with singer Elton John remarking at a concert in Tucson: “We are all very pleased to be playing in Arizona.

So what the #@!% is with these people?” Fingergate T he ongoing feud between Obama and Brewer erupted into full public view as Gov. Brewer “welcomed” Obama upon his arrival at the Phoe- nix-Mesa Gateway Airport on January 25, 2012. Meeting on the tarmac, the two immediately engaged in an intense conversation, talking over each other, the President abruptly walking off with Brewer in mid-sentence. During the exchange, Brewer pointed her finger in Obama’s face, and photos of the encounter imme- diately went viral and dominated TV news and the blogosphere for days, with some referring to the incident as “Fingergate.”"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"236 T—fi NfiThff 9/11? “He was a little disturbed about my book,” Brewer told a reporter after the incident. Obama reportedly objected to a description in Brewer’s book of a prior meeting at the White House, which at the time Brewer had referred to as “very cordial,” whereas in print she had described Obama’s behavior during the meeting as patronizing and condescending. “I felt a little bit like I was being lectured to, and I was a little kid in a classroom, if you will, and he was this wise professor and I was this little kid, and this little kid knows what the problem is and I felt minimized to say the least.” Keep Your Finger N aturally, the Rev. Jesse Jackson saw fit to weigh in on the matter, calling on Brewer to apologize and “put her hand in her pocket.” “Even George Wal - lace never put his finger in Dr. King’s face,” Jackson said. “She should not get away with that. She knew the cameras were rolling. She knew what she was doing.” Jackson encouraged people to flood Brewer’s office with calls and emails, calling her gesture “the ultimate insult.” He gave out an 800-number for Brewer’s office and urged those calling to say, “We don’t need her fin- ger,” and later reiterated, “Tell Ms. Brewer, ‘Keep your finger in your pocket.’” Whether at Jackson’s urging or other - wise, Brewer’s office did receive more than 12,000 letters and emails from people across the nation, most of them condemning the governor’s actions. While many of the writ - ers were upset with the governor, some calling her “trashy” and “tasteless,” oth- ers offered etiquette tips on welcoming a head of state. “If you approached me like you did the president I would have taken great comfort by poking you in the nose,” wrote Eleanor Tafolla from Cathedral City, Calif. “You might want to work on you (sic) prissy attitude you project. Whoa lady you did not deserve a talk with the president or anyone else for that matter.” Chuck Bower of Indiana, meanwhile, congratulated the governor, writing, “The only thing you did wrong was wave the ‘wrong’ finger in his face.” Brewer herself attempted, unsuccessfully, to downplay the incident, telling Greta Van Susteren on Fox, “When I talk I am animated and I talk with my hands,” continuing, “The picture was probably shot when I was moving my hands around.”"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"237 T—fi RThffffift ftttffiflTh Tfifl—\u0016ft ftttffi\u0015\u0014 Gft\u0013fi\u0012\u0016ft\u0012 Captain America to the Rescue S enator John McCain defended Brewer by saying that she had a “legitimate point” to make concerning the president’s immigration policies. “He has been to Arizona on many occasions,” McCain said. “He’s never been to the U.S.-Arizona border where Fast and Furious took place, where we had a Bor - der Patrol agent killed, where we’ve got drugs are flowing into Arizona, into Phoenix, and around the country.... The cartels have people sitting on moun- taintops in Arizona, guiding the drug runners up to Phoenix, which are distrib - uted all over the country. It’s a big issue with our governor, and it should be.” McCain’s former Vice-Presidential running mate Sarah Palin was a little more blunt in expressing her views on Obama’s border policy, saying that he lacked “the cojones” to deal effectively with illegal immigration and border security. Scorpions for Breakfast W hile campaigning for President in 2008, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee adopted a lighter tone on the border issue in one of his commercials, saying, “My plan to secure the borders—two words: Chuck Norris.” Norris later recalled this in a column he wrote for World Net Daily , fol - lowing up with, “Well, I join millions of others by saying that Arizona’s remedy for securing the borders is three words: Gov. Jan Brewer.” Chuck also commented in his column, “I commend Gov. Brewer not only for her courage and tenacity, but for doing what the federal government refuses to do: protect Americans from more border invasion,” and shared several of his favorite “Jan Brewer facts,” including these two: Jan Brewer flosses her teeth with barbed wire from the border. Jan Brewer eats scorpions for breakfast and burps up rattlesnakes. Thanks for sharing, Chuck. As it happens, “Scorpions for Breakfast” is the title of Brewer’s 2011 book, the subtitle for which was “My Fight Against Special Interests, Liberal Media, and Cynical Politicos to Secure America’s Border.” Released in Novem- ber, the book ranked 276,665th in sales on Amazon.com before the airport showdown, but quickly shot to No. 21 on the “Best Sellers in Books” category and No. 2 on the site’s “Movers and Shakers.” Asked whether the spat with Obama had been a ploy to sell more books, Brewer told CNN, “Absolutely not, that’s absolutely ridiculous.”"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"238 T—fi NfiThff 9/11? Hitler’s Daughter I nevitably, Brewer became the focal point of much of the criticism of the SB 1070’s opponents, with an unfortunate percentage of the personal at - tacks directed against her attempting to paint her as a Nazi, to which Brewer re- sponded, “Knowing that my father died fighting the Nazi regime in Germany, that I lost him when I was 11 because of that... and then to have them call me Hitler’s daughter. It hurts. It’s ugliness beyond anything I’ve ever experienced.” Very unfortunate indeed, except for the fact that her father died ten years after World War II ended from lung cancer, believed to be the result of his ex - posure to chemicals while working as a civilian supervisor at the Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada.

Snubbed G overnor Brewer also felt insulted at having not been invited to a 2011 White House meeting on immigration reform, even though the guest list didn’t include any current governors or members of Congress. “You would have thought one of the governors would have been invited, since we are on the front lines fighting for security there,” Brewer observed, a fair comment given that the Rev. Al Sharpton and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had been in attendance. “I wish I would have been invited,” Brewer told Fox News. “It was a little bit of a snub, if you will,” she continued, later clarifying her feel - ings with, “not having been invited today was truly a snub. It was a snub.” Perhaps this was one reason Brewer skipped a White House dinner hon- oring the nation’s governors—considered a highlight of the annual National Governors Association conference—saying that she didn’t want to participate in a “social” event. Crying Wolf S peaking on illegal-immigration-related crime in 2010, Brewer made the statement that “law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert either buried or just lying out there that have been beheaded.” A Fox News team subsequently investigated this claim, and concluded that in the previous two years only one human skull had been found, and it had been determined to be related to animal activity.

Obama D epending on your politics, Sheriff Joe Arpaio was either a modern-day Wyatt Earp, representing “America’s last line of defense against illegal im- migration” as the organization “Americans for Sheriff Joe” sought to brand him, or a real-life Buford T. Justice, the bungling foul-mouthed sheriff in Smokey and the Bandit played by Jackie “I’m gonna barbeque yo’ ass in molasses” Gleason, engaged in yet another grand pub - licity stunt (which was simultane- ously an attempt to divert attention away from a Justice Department investigation into allegations of ra - cial profiling) by launching an of - ficial inquiry into the supposedly long-settled question of President Obama’s eligibility."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"242 Tffi— N—fftt 9/11? As is generally the case in these situations, the truth would likely have lain somewhere in between, except for the fact that the Arpaio-vs.-Obama plotline was a highly-intentional component of an even larger script, one designed to captivate the American public and focus their attention on Phoenix, all part of a sophisticated subconscious psychological preprogramming regimen. Still, even given that it was all part of the lead-up to a nuclear attack on innocent civilians, one has to admit that, in retrospect, this second ongoing feud between an Arizona official and the President of the United States made for damn fine entertainment. Elvis has left the police station S heriff Joe once told the listening audience during an interview on a Las Vegas radio station that “my best arrest was Elvis Presley,” a story he is ever- so-fond of repeating, “but I let him go. I took him down to the police station. I guess he conned me out of giving him a ticket. That was in 1957.” When asked by the interviewer if Elvis had comped him some tickets to The King’s Vegas act, Arpaio retorted, “No, but he gave 10 Cadillacs to narcotics detec - tives around the country, but I never got one.” The arrest reportedly happened when Arpaio was a rookie cop with the Las Vegas Police Department, Joe recalling that he stopped Elvis for speeding on his motorcycle, with a beautiful blonde on the back of the bike hanging on to the King. “Maybe because I was young...I let him talk me out of giving him a ticket,” Joe relates. Then, as the story goes, Presley followed Joe down to the station house where he signed autographs and even asked if the police garage could tune up his bike. Interestingly, there are no photos of the incident (maybe all of the cam- eras in the police station were broken), and since Elvis didn’t get a ticket, there’s no paper trail. And although Arpaio’s fellow officers supposedly got autographs, Arpaio didn’t. When asked about this at one of his book sign- ings, Joe snapped, “Why did I need his? He should’ve asked me for my auto - graph.” Alrighty, then.

In a statement that just about tells you all you need to know, the Phoenix New Times observed, If you’d told us last week that one day we’d be sweatin’ it out in a make- shift, outdoor jail in the Arizona desert as the 79-year-old sheriff of one of the largest counties in the country sang a duet with an Elvis imper - sonator—as female inmates threw pink panties at him—we honestly wouldn’t have been too surprised; this is Maricopa County under the Joe Arpaio regime/reality show. Arpaio naturally took the opportunity to point out that he’d once busted the real Elvis in Las Vegas, and, as the story in the New Times continued, At first glance, the inmates seemed to be having a blast—several served as dancers who swayed behind “Elvis” as he sang “Jailhouse Rock” and many laughed along as the sheriff joked about the heat. However, when the inmates lined up to get a piece of cake and a cup of ice cream (the ice cream cups expired a year ago, as one deputy nervously pointed out. “That’s alright, though” he then said) we had a chance to speak to some of the gals when they weren’t under the sheriff ’s watchful eye. “We don’t want cake and ice cream,” one inmate then told the New Times , “we want some f*cking air conditioning.” Hunka hunka burnin’ love . Shut Your Mouths L iving conditions were certainly an ongoing concern in Tent City, which Ar - paio himself described as a concentration camp, especially in 2011 when the t emperature in Phoenix hit 118 °F and Arpaio measured the temperature inside Tent City at 145 °F. Some inmates complained that their shoes were melting from the heat, which didn’t seem to matter much to Sheriff Joe, who had told inmates complaining of the heat in 2003 (when the temperature outside was a mere 110 °F), “It’s 120 degrees in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents, have to wear full body armor, and they didn’t commit any crimes, so shut your mouths.”"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"244 Tffi— N—fftt 9/11? In 1997, Amnesty International published a report on Arpaio’s jails which found that Tent City is not an “adequate or humane alternative to housing in - mates in suitable...jail facilities,” and in 2008, Federal Judge Neil Wake ruled in a l awsuit brought by the ACLU that the Maricopa County jails violated the constitutional rights of inmates in medical and other care-related issues. The suit alleged that “Arpaio routinely abused pre-trial detainees [housed in Tent City] at Maricopa County Jail by feeding them moldy bread, rotten fruit and other contaminated food, housing them in cells so hot as to endanger their health, denying them care for serious medical and mental health needs and keeping them packed as tightly as sardines in holding cells for days at a time during intake.” Pink Underwear, Green Bologna, Playboy and Newt P ink underwear was standard issue not only for women in Sheriff Joe’s jails, but for men, as well. The Maricopa County Sheriff ’s website cited the pink undies as “world-famous,” and Arpaio sold customized pink boxers (with the sheriff ’s logo and “Go Joe” printed on them) as a fund-raiser for his Sheriff ’s Posse Association. Limiting meals to twice daily, Arpaio served inmates surplus food (in - cluding green bologna)—with meals costing just 40 cents, a fact of which he w as most proud—for which each person incarcerated was charged a dol - lar a day. “It costs more to feed our police dogs than our inmates,” Arpaio bo asted, continuing, “The dogs never committed a crime, and they’re work - ing for a living.” He cut out smoking, and when he eliminated coffee, inmates complained loudly, to which he responded, “This isn’t the Ritz-Carlton. If you don’t like it, don’t come back.” He also banned possession of sexually-explicit material, including Playboy magazine, and limited prisoners’ viewing to G-rated movies and a select few television channels, including Disney and the Weather Chan- nel. Why the Weather Channel? “I think my chain gang deserves to know how hot it is when they hit the streets.” Arpaio took away weight-lifting equipment and reinstituted chain gangs for men. In 1996, he created the nation’s first chain gang for women, saying “I don’t believe in discrimination in my jail system. Crime knows no gender and neither should punishment.” In February 2007, the sheriff instituted an in-house radio station called KJOE, which broadcast classical music, opera, Frank Sinatra hits, patriotic music and educational programming.

So asking for the public’s help in this endeavor makes sense.” Commenting further on the posse, Arpaio said, “People from all walks of life have contacted my office saying they want to help me in this fight in some way.” He continued, “This is how they can do that—by being members of a vol - unteer posse with the specific aim of fighting illegal immigration and lending their particular expertise to the fight.” Those sworn in as members of the posse by the sheriff included pilots, attorneys, former law enforcement or military officers, truckers, business owners, computer programmers, financial advisers and real estate experts. “Let’s face it,” Arpaio said, “my deputies are outnum- bered so the more volunteers we can get trained and out on the streets to fight illegal immigration, the better off we will be to fight it.” Interestingly, those joining the posse included one Wyatt Earp, a local resi - dent whose uncle, so it was claimed, was the famous lawman of the same name, and a former Chicago police official who had retired to Arizona, named, no kidding, Dick Tracy. Also sworn in as illegal immigration fighters and part of the posse: martial-arts master, movie star, and former sheriff ’s deputy Steven Seagal; body-builder and actor Peter Lupus, best remembered for the role of strong - man Willy Armitage on the 1960s Mission: Impossible television series; and, fellow body-builder, actor and deputy with the Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Office, Lou Ferrigno, best known for portraying Bruce Banner’s green muscled-up alter ego in The Incredible Hulk CBS television series ...

Oh, Jesus I n late 2008 and early 2009, Arpaio was featured in the three-episode Fox Re- ality Channel series, Smile...You’re Under Arrest! , in which individuals with outstanding warrants were tricked into presenting themselves to authorities. Apparently this must’ve only whetted Sheriff Joe’s appetite for reality TV, because in 2011 he found a way to get himself back on the air in an incident best described by Pete Kotz of the True Crime Report (truecrimereport.com). In “Joe Arpaio, Steven Seagal Take Down Cockfighting Ring...With a Tank?,” Kotz writes, Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio fancies himself as “Ameri - ca’s toughest sheriff.” But he may have outdone himself this time by pull - ing off a rare politician’s trifecta of utter shamelessness, self-aggrandize- ment, and wholesale government waste... When we last left this one-man lawsuit machine, he was busy running up huge settlements against his department, which covers greater Phoe- nix. He also has a history of using his department to spy on political enemies. But this time Arpaio went for the gold. It seems alleged actor Steven Seagal was in town filming for his al- leged-reality TV show, Lawman . And since Arpaio is to television cam- eras what shit is to stink, the good sheriff gladly offered to help him out with some dramatic crime-fighting footage. The problem was that when you’re more showman than working man, you’re not very good at catching actual bad guys. So Arpaio was a little short on quality criminals to film getting bagged. That’s when these two dopes came up with the comical idea to raid Jesus Llovera’s cockfighting ring. Llovera raised chickens at his home. He also has a previous misde- meanor bust for attending a cockfighting match. But there’s no record supporting anything that would imply he was armed or dangerous. Nonetheless, when the sheriff ’s department raided his house, they arrived with dozens of SWAT team members, a bomb robot, armored vehicles and, yes, even a tank [actually it’s a self-propelled howitzer, not that that’s any less absurd]. Deputies blew out the windows of the home and used the tank—commanded by Seagal—to smash down a wall. When it was all over, they found 115 chickens—which they mysteri - ously euthanized on the spot. They also found Llovera, unarmed. The sheriff ’s department claims it had info that Llovera was armed. It just won’t say what that info is.

After all, this kind of manpower is usually only used against terrorists and cartel kingpins. The operation is estimated to have cost tens of thousands of dollars. But in the end, all they have to show for it is lowly Jesus Llovera, who was pinched on suspicion of cockfighting. Oh, Jesus. Disneyland on the Public Dime A n analysis by the Maricopa County Office of Management and Budget completed in 2011 found that Arpaio had misspent almost $100 million in taxpayer dollars over the previous five years. Among the findings was that Arpaio had used a detention fund to pay for investigations of political rivals, and the analysis also showed a number of inappropriate spending items, in- cluding a trip to Alaska where deputies stayed at a fishing resort, and, of course, the obligatory tax-payer funded excursions to Disneyland. Separate investigations by the Arizona Republic uncovered widespread abuse of public funds and county policies by Arpaio’s office, including high-ranking employees routinely charging expensive meals and stays at luxu- ry hotels on their county credit cards. Making History I n June 2008, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of Arpaio’s office amid accusations of discrimination and unconstitutional searches and seizures, in response to which Arpaio sub - sequently held a press conference to announce that he would not cooperate with the investigation. DoJ then filed suit against him, with a spokeswoman stating that Arpaio’s refusal to cooperate was unprecedented and that this was the first time DoJ had been forced to sue an agency to compel access to docu- ments and facilities. In December of 2011, the Justice Department released the findings of a 3-year investigation of Arpaio’s office amid complaints of racial profiling and a culture of bias at the top level of the agency. DoJ accused Arpaio of engaging in “unconstitutional policing” by unfairly targeting Latinos for detention and arrest, and retaliating against critics. The report concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history. Based on the report, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security revoked the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office’s (MCSO) federal authority to identify and detain illegal immigrants."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"248 Tffi— N—fftt 9/11? In a separate action that same December, a U.S. District Court Judge enjoined Arpaio and the MCSO from “detaining any person based only on knowledge or reasonable belief...that the person is unlawfully present with- in the United States,” thereby halting anti-illegal immigration enforcement by MCSO as it was then practiced. Reign of Terror I n connection with an FBI inquiry, a federal grand jury investigated Arpaio’s office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations, and in February 2010 Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio had indeed “misused the power of his office.” The Mayor of Phoenix, himself a target of Arpaio’s alleged politically-motivat - ed legal actions, called the sheriff ’s long list of questionable prosecutions “a reign of terror,” with other of Arpaio’s targets including: his 2004 and 2008 opponent for the office of Sheriff of Maricopa County; the Arizona Attorney General and Maricopa County Manager; the Maricopa County Board of Su- pervisors; the current and former Maricopa Superior Court Presiding Judge; an attorney for the ACLU; the former Maricopa County School Superinten- dent; and the editor of the Phoenix New Times . Arpaio’s partner-in-crime in these matters, Andrew Thomas, Maricopa County’s top prosecutor, has since been disbarred, and criminal investigations are ongoing. Protecting America N ews of a corrupt sheriff is about as surprising as stories of an unscrupu- lous attorney; a corrupt sheriff under investigation by the Department of Justice for charges relating to immigration enforcement who turns around and launches an investigation of the President of the United States for possibly being, well, an illegal immigrant (or constitutionally ineligible to hold the pres - idency at the very least), now that’s a different story altogether. When Arpaio wasn’t singing Sinatra, or serving as a judge for “Maricopa County Jail Idol,” or smashing through the gates of chicken farms with Steven Seagal, or having dinner with Motor City Madman Ted Nugent, or filing some bogus legal action against one of his perceived rivals, one would have hoped that he’d have been up to the business of protecting the good citizens of Maricopa County. Apparently, however, Arpaio felt that his law enforcement duties by ex - tension included the safeguarding of the entire American public from illegal immigrants, and as such, the sheriff saw fit to take action regarding what an ev - er-growing number of concerned citizens in Arizona and all across the country"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"249 Affi—ffttfiTh’ft Tfl\u0017\u0016\u0015—ft\u0014 S\u0015—fftt\u0013\u0013 viewed as President Obama’s failure to provide proof of citizenship (natural born or otherwise), and, by extension, his ineligibility to hold the highest of - fice in the land.

For those following the story closely during those years, it certainly seemed probable that, if not for the birther issue in general and Sheriff Joe in particular—a saga complete with suspicion-generating birth certificates and oddly-missing records—internet news site World Net Daily (WND) would have gone slap out of business, as the birther nerve-center featured stories on one related topic after another in a never-ending torrent of coverage. (WND’s CEO Joseph Farah even went so far as to encourage people to donate to Ar - paio’s investigation of Obama.) There was so much fodder left lying around (Obama’s long form birth certificate, for example, released in electronic format supposedly contained all-too-obvious evidence of digital fakery). WND and other conservative al - ternative media outlets grew fat on the bounty, and provided the faithful with nigh-daily evidences of a usurper in their midst. “Patriots” everywhere were washed in the digital ink of conspiratorial enlightenment and nourished by the truth of subversives revealed. However, it is all simply scripted entertainment: polarizing the masses. Showdown at the AZ Corral A s one might have expected, Arpaio’s Cold Case Posse turned up evidence of forgery, among a number of other issues which in their assessment warranted further investigation, and the only thing less surprising than these results was the mainstream media’s complete blackout of the findings—yet more evidence of a vast left-wing elitist conspiracy to protect the Usurper-in- Chief, many would claim. And thus the showdown was set, the good-ole-boy racist sheriff vs. the mi - nority President, with the fact of Arpaio being the first law enforcement official in the entire county willing to take on the commander-in-chief on this matter qualifying as genuinely newsworthy in itself.

Nickel-Bag Joe A former U.S. Army military policeman, Arpaio served as a cop in D.C. and Vegas before being appointed as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (precursor to the DEA). During his 25-year tenure with the DEA, Arpaio was stationed in Argentina, Turkey and Mexico, advancing through the ranks to become head of DEA’s Arizona branch. While working for the DEA, Arpaio earned the nickname “Nickel Bag” for the small-time drug busts he became well-known for, which, for those with inquiring minds, raises the question of how an agent with such a reputation got to be head of operations for the state of Arizona in the first place. As we quietly contemplate this conundrum, we spot them, lurking in the shadows, in the dark recesses of the internet—unsubstantiated allegations, ru- mors that Nickel-Bag Joe was in reality a CIA asset, assigned to the DEA and ushered upward to top management to help insure non-interference with the Company’s drug-running operations in Arizona. The blurry picture becomes a little clearer—Sheriff Joe, former DEA, per - haps not-so-former CIA, a bumbling dupe that could be counted on, as always, to do the bidding of his handlers; or, perhaps, a shrewd operator hiding behind a façade of illicit activity and enshrouded in a veil of corruption (which some- how never seemed to catch up to him), designed to shield covert activities— maybe a combination of the two.

This group polled citizens and employees of the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office and compiled a list of Top Ten Reasons NOT to vote for Arpaio, which included rather obvious—but se - rious nonetheless—allegations such as, “With Arpaio, real law enforcement takes a backseat to publicity stunts,” and, “Millions of tax dollars have been wasted on lawsuits.” Each of the points was backed up with further details, and as support for the contention that Arpaio was “responsible for a critical and dangerous shortage of personnel in both the jails and patrol,” the following evidence was given: ...Arpaio has created a critical and dangerous shortage of deputy sheriffs needed to per - form fundamental law enforcement services in the unincorporated areas of the County. Deputies that could be assigned to patrol, are assigned instead as personal bodyguards for Sheriff Arpaio. Detention officers, desperately needed in the jails, are assigned to the labor-intensive, publici- ty-producing chain gangs in order to get Arpaio on more TV news programs. Projects that bol- ster Arpaio’s ego, satisfy his need for publicity, and insure his personal safety are all fully staffed. Unfortunately, at the same time on the streets and in the jails of the county, lives are placed at risk by Arpaio’s self-serving abuse of authority. Also Sheriff Arpaio has the largest executive staff of any police agency in Arizona and per - haps the United States. By comparison, the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department, the na- tion’s largest, has half as many on the executive staff. The millions spend on excess executive po - sitions should be used to hire employees that could be assigned where really needed. The list also included the fact that “Hundreds of current sheriff ’s office employees, represented by a number of employ- ee organizations”—reportedly including the State of Arizona Fraternal Order of Police, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Five, Maricopa County Deputies Association and others—“have ex - pressed a vote of no confidence in Sheriff Arpaio.” Considering the source, still kinda makes you wonder how he got re-elected four times."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"252 Tffi— N—fftt 9/11? toyed with the nation’s national security apparatus like a child with Legos on Christmas morning.

Section Three The Ritual Proper"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11? Chapter Eleven Aleister Crowley’s Liber 44: The Mass Of The Phoenix T he phoenix is a mythical sacred firebird found in the mythologies of numerous cultures around the world, including the Egyptians and Greeks. Depending on the myth, the lifecycle of the phoenix varies from 500 to 1,000 years, at the end of which it is fully consumed in a self-generated con- flagration (sometimes the bird is said to build a nest, a funeral pyre of sorts, other times not). Up from the ashes, so the cliché goes, a new phoenix arises. Although physical descriptions of the creature vary considerably, writing in his book, The Phoenix: An Illustrated Review of Occultism and Philosophy , au - thor and mystic Manly P. Hall describes it thus: Among the ancients a fabulous bird called the Phoenix is described by early writers ... in size and shape it resembles the eagle, but with certain differences. The body of the Phoenix is one covered with glossy purple feathers, and the plumes in its tail are alternately blue and red. The head of the bird is light in color, and about its neck is a circlet of golden plumage. At the back of its back the Phoenix has a crest of feathers of brilliant color. 1 The Bennu, Ra and Murder T he Bennu was the Egyptian version of the phoenix, thought to be inspired by the now-extinct Bennu heron. Associated with the rising of the Nile, resurrection and the sun, the Bennu represented creation and renewal and was connected with the Egyptian calendar."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"256 Tfifl NflffTh 9/11? The titles of the Bennu included “Ascending One” and “Lord of Jubilees” (Arizona’s 100 th anniversary in 2012!), and the name itself is related to the verb “we- ben,” meaning “to rise brilliantly,” or “to shine.” Accord - ing to legend, it was the Bennu bird’s cry at the creation of the world that marked the beginning of time, and the Bennu helped oversee the regulation of time and its di - visions: hours, days and nights, weeks and years (more on the relationship between time and the phoenix in Chapter 22). 2 Kno wn from the Book of the Dead and other Egyptian texts as one of the sacred sym- bols of worship at Heliopolis, the “City of the Sun,” the Bennu was closely associated with the rising sun and was considered the soul of the Egyptian sun-god Ra. (In some variations of the myth, the reborn phoenix embalms the ashes of its former self in an egg and deposits it in Heliopolis.) Due to its association with rebirth, the Bennu was also be- lieved to be a manifestation of the resurrected Osiris and the bird was often depicted perched in his sacred willow tree. The Greeks envisioned the bird more as a peacock or eagle—both Hesiod and Herodotus referenced the mythical bird in their writings—and related it to their word for the color purple-red/crimson, phoinix , also meaning palm tree, or its fruit, dates. Other related Greek words include phoinós , “blood-red,” and, interestingly, phonós , “murder.” A Symbol of Resurrection and Initiation T he phoenix became popular in early Christian art and literature as a sym- bol of Christ, representing resurrection and the life ever-lasting. Chris - tians, however, were not the first or only group to adopt the symbol by any stretch of the imagination: the ancient Mystery Schools also used the phoenix as a symbol of immortality. Again, writing his book, The Phoenix, Manly P. Hall informs us, The Phoenix is generally regarded as representing immortality and resur - rection ... The Phoenix is one sign of the secret orders of the ancient world a nd of the initiate of those orders, for it was common to refer to one who had been accepted into the temples as a man twice-born, or reborn. Wisdom confers a new life, and those who become wise are born again. 3 "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"257 AfiflffThftfl— C—ffittfifl\u0017’Th Lff\u0016fl— 44: T\u0015fl M\u0014ThTh O\u0013 T\u0015fl P\u0015ffifl\u0012ff\u0011 A Symbol of Lucifer D uring a 1988 interview with Barbara Walters while on the presidential cam - paign trail, George H.W. Bush seemed caught off guard when asked by Walters i f he was a Christian. After fumbling around for a moment, he answered shrewdly, “If by being a Christian, you ask if I am ‘born again’, then yes, I am a Christian.” Like all Bonesmen, Bush had been reborn during a Satanic initi - ation rite at Yale, emerging from a coffin after a perverse ritual (during which they reportedly pleasure themselves while recounting their sexual exploits, among other things) in a blasphemous mockery of the Resurrection which signifies the ini - tiates’ rising to new life in Lucifer. Satanists often utilize well- known Christian symbols, inverting their meaning to suit their own dark pur - poses. The idea of the phoenix as a symbol of Lucifer is not new, and many occultists see the firebird as appropriately representing the fallen angel who was cast down in flames, and who, they believe, will one day rise triumphant (or, perhaps that day was in fact Black Christmas). Crowley’s “Mass of the Phoenix” T he “Official Instructions of the A:.A:.” give a basic description of the Mass of the Phoenix, referring to it as “an instruction in a simple and exoteric form of Eucharist” and “A Ritual of the Law.” This indicates that the ritual is considered a true Mass by Thelemites in that it celebrates the Blessed Sacra - ment: this is not, however, your father’s (or your Father’s) Eucharist. In Liber Aleph , Crowley puts the Mass of the Phoenix on par with the Gnostic Mass, stating, “Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by the Rite of the Gnostic Catholic Church, or that of the Phoenix”—the “Miracle of the Mass” being the process of transubstantiation, in which the bread and wine are held to be transmuted into the literal flesh and blood of Christ/the god of your choice.

The bottom line is that the Mass of the Phoenix is designed as a perverse counterpart to the Lord’s Supper, one of the most holy sacraments in all of Chris - tendom, and the sick bastards that orchestrated Black Christmas took enormous pleasure in invoking The Mass of the Phoenix through their actions in Phoenix on the traditional day of the celebration of the Savior’s birth—in yet another repug - nant tribute to the Great Beast, Aleister Crowley. Oh, but it ain’t over yet. 4 Forty-Four T he abominable Mass of the Phoenix was first printed as Chapter 44 in Crowley’s The Book of Lies , and later as Liber 44 . In the ritual, a bell is rung a total of 44 times, 44 also being the gematria value of the Hebrew word for blood, dam ( damn! )—with blood playing, as we’re all-too-aware, a major role in the mass, as well as, unfortunately, in Black Christmas. Liber 44 invokes Ra, the Sun God—with the sun beginning its annual upward journey on December 25 th —and wouldn’t you know, 44 is also the sacred number of Horus, son of the aforementioned Osiris, the green-skinned Egyptian god of the Underworld. Furthermore, in what might to the uninitiated seem an unrelated coincidence, Barack Obama is the 44 th President of the United States, but you’ll have to wait until Chapter 16 to learn more about the Illuminati’s Sun King. Make no mistake, however, in the occult worldview, the spilling of blood is absolutely necessary for regeneration and renewal, and the New World Order was born out of the blood, and ashes, of Phoenix—a mass sacrifice to the one true bringer of illumination, Lucifer. 44 Monroe N aturally, the scripters of Black Christmas sought to tie the number 44 to the MegaRitual in a tangible way, which they were readily able to accom-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"260 Tfifl NflffTh 9/11? plish in an ingenious manner that yielded even further insid - er-baseball jollies. Located at the northeast corner of Monroe Street and First Avenue in downtown Phoenix, and well within the primary blast zone, 44 Monroe was Ar - izona’s tallest resi - dential structure. Al - though the building was not toppled by the blast, and didn’t collapse from the re- sulting fires (hmmm, must’ve been the lack of jet fuel), it naturally sustained massive damage. Reporters and commentators far and wide used the building’s hulking skeleton as a visual reference-point in the alien post-blast downtown landscape, with the phrase “44 Monroe” likely being uttered nearly as many times as “Route 93,” although who knows for sure. What really gave the occultist insiders the giggleshits, however, was the fact that 44 Monroe included a direct reference to President James Monroe, after whom the street was named, Monroe of course being one of a number of Masons to hold the highest office in the land. (If you’re really up on your 9/11 fruitcake trivia, you’ll recall from Most Dangerous that President James Garfield was a fellow Mason, and submitted a proof for the 47th Problem of Euclid that utilized a trapezoid...oh, go look it up.) A Lament for Black Christmas “Forty-Four” or “44 Blues” is a blues standard popularized by Roosevelt Sykes in the 1930s. His lyrics played on the differing use of the phrase forty-four: a .44 caliber revolver, train number 44 and, presumably, prison cell number 44: Well I walked all night long, with my .44 in my hand (2x) Now I was looking for my woman, found her with another man Well I wore my .44 so long, Lord it made my shoulder sore (2x) After I do what I want to, ain’t gonna wear my .44 no more Now I heard my baby say, she heard that 44 whistle blow (2x) Lord it sounds like, ain’t gonna blow that whistle no more Now I got a little cabin, and it’s number 44 (2x) Lord I wake up every morning, the wolf be scratching on my door. Speaking of the Wolf, in 1954 Howlin’ Wolf recorded his version of the song in the Chicago blues style, with Willie Dixon on the bass and an in- sistent “martial shuffle on the snare drum plus a bass drum that slammed down like an industrial punch-press.” Wolf retained Sykes’ handgun ref- erence and added, “Well I’m so mad this morning, I don’t know where in the world to go.” With Wolf ’s usual gruff and overpowering vocals, the overall effect was menacing. Given the repeated use of the number forty-four in this MegaRitual, 44 Blues might not be a bad lament for Black Christmas, particularly con- sidering that “Blue Christmas,” most notably performed by Elvis Presley, is out of the running.

Also known as DeMolay International, the Order derives its name from Jacques DeMolay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. Founded by a Freemason and modeled after Freemasonry, it is an international organization for young men ages 12-21, and the DeMolay Hall of Fame includes such luminaries as former Pres- ident Bill Clinton, Walt Disney and John Wayne. Cooper is regarded as being the first artist to introduce horror imagery to rock’n’roll and is credited with helping shape the sound and look of heavy metal. Cooper’s 1976 album “Alice Cooper Goes to Hell” featured the classic tune, “I’m Al- ways Chasing Rainbows,” also sung by Wizard of Oz star Judy Garland in the 1941 movie Ziegfeld Girl . Although the majority of his career was marked by substance abuse and de - bauchery, in his later years Cooper became a born-again Christian, holding an annu- al charity event in Phoenix for the Solid Rock Foundation called “Christmas Pudding.” Yet, following Black Christmas, some began to wonder if Cooper’s conversion had actually been of the Christian variety, in particular because of the lyrics from one of the songs on his 2000 album entitled Brutal Planet .

Benediction PostScript F rom Paul Weston’s Aleister Crowley and the Aeon of Horus : [Robert Anton] Wilson stated that his entry to Chapel Perilous began when he was reading Crowley’s The Book of Lies in 1971. It is a work full of codes and riddles, Zen-type epigrams, poetry, jokes and magick. Crowley had stated that somewhere within it was concealed the inner secret of Freemasonry and Illuminism.... Wilson was inspired to make major use of the symbol of the eye in the triangle, treating it as a mo - tif of the secret brotherhood. He knew that its portrayal on the dollar bill had been linked to Freemasonry. Gradually he came to know that it connects with the Egyptian Eye of Horus design and was used on cere- monial headgear by Crowley. The Beast referred to his work as ‘scientific illuminism’, and occasionally to himself as ‘Epopt of the Illuminati.’... On July 22nd Wilson performed a customised Crowleyan ceremony involving ‘Tantric sex-trance’. The next morn- ing he ‘awoke with an urgent message from Dreamland’. It stated that ‘Sirius is very im- portant’. Looking for relevant information in his occult books, he struck gold in Kenneth Grant’s The Magical Revival . Wilson was im- pressed to read that: ‘Phoenix was Crowley’s secret name in the Ordo Templi Orientis ... The Phoenix was also an ancient constellation in which Sothis, or Sir - ius, was the chief star.’ ‘Crowley identified the heart of his magical current with one particular Star. In Occult Tradition, this is “the sun behind the sun,” the Hidden God, the vast star Sirius.’"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11?

This was not surprising, given that mainstream Mayan scholars had never supported the notion that the culture had viewed this date as anything other than the end of one block of time and the beginning of another. The Mayans created a sophisticated system of interlocking calendars marking various in- crements of time, and December 21 st , 2012 merely corresponded to the end of “13 baktun,” a baktun being a period of 144,000 days."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"264 Tff— N—ttTh 9/11? Galactic Alignment T he Mayans were also highly competent astronomers, and had been able to calculate the dates of solstices far into the future, including the date for winter solstice in the year 2012. Various researchers, including John Major Jenkins, contended that the Mayans were further aware of an astronomical alignment occurring during this same general timeframe, which Jenkins called “galactic alignment.” This term simply refers to the sun’s alignment (as viewed from earth, obviously) with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, which lies some 26,000 light years from our solar system. (Actually, the phenomenon of galactic alignment occurs over about a sixteen-year period, but that doesn’t sound very urgent or dramatic, so very few 2012ers pointed this out). It was thought that, to the Mayans and other ancient cultures, this appar - ent return of the sun to the heart of the galaxy—viewed as the womb of cre- ation—marked a grand re-birth of the sun, the beginning of a new age; actual - ly, not of a “New Age” (as in “the dawning of the Age of Aquarius”), but rather of a new Great Age. The Cycle Restarts Anew T he cycle of precession is the amount of time, estimated at roughly 26,000 years, that it takes the earth’s axis to complete one full rotation as our plan- et wobbles slightly in its orbit of the sun year after year. During this cycle, the earth’s axis is oriented towards, or pointing at, one of the twelve (now thirteen) zodiacal signs for approximately 2,000 years. Each of these 2,000-year periods is viewed as an Age, with the entire cycle being referred to as the Great Age. In occult thought (not universally so, but certainly for those behind Black Christmas) and on the occult calendar, December 21 st , 2012, was not only the annual winter solstice, with the sun at its lowest point in the sky—marking the yearly “death” of the sun—but also marked the end of a Great Age. It was the most auspicious date in human history, or at least in the last 26,000 years of it. Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, on Steroids T he Zodiac is a near-universal artifact found in practically every great civ - ilization around the globe, used to keep track of the passage of the ages. For the purposes of this discussion, if you want to think of the earth’s axis as one hand (pointing to one of the Zodiacal signs) of a giant cosmic clock, the other hand would be formed by a line running from the earth through the center of the sun.

So 12/21/12 was the death, the final setting, of the sun of the prior Great Age; yet, it was not this occasion that the globalists were intent upon commem- orating in grand fashion. Rather, the orchestrators of Black Christmas were fix - ated upon greeting the first rising of the re-born sun of the new Great Age. After reaching its lowest point in the sky on winter solstice, the sun re- mains “in the depths of the earth” for three days before beginning its annual journey upward through the heavens on December 25 th (previously commem- orated by the Roman festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti , or “Birthday of Sol Invictus”)—and it was this event, the inaugural appearance of the Sun of the New Great Age, that was the focus of the Great American Holocaust. The Great Wedding T here is another visual phenomenon (again, solely from earth’s perspec - tive) in which the Milky Way Galaxy has been drifting slowly closer to - wards the earth’s horizon over the past several thousand years. Supposedly ancient cultures were aware of this astronomical fact, as well, and integrated it into their myth-making as a prophecy of a future time when the Milky Way— which was often viewed as a heavenly abode—would join with earth, i.e. the fabled union of Heaven and Earth, which is indeed occurring in our era. This, too, informed occult thought on the importance of the 2012 timeframe, making it all-the-more attractive to practitioners of the dark arts as an appropri - ate period during which to engineer a modern-day slaughter of the innocents.

The Bennu, the Shen-shen and the Rech T he ancient Egyptians identified the phoenix, or bennu, with the soul of Osiris, “the rising god.” According to tradition, the mythical bird connected the morning star (Venus)—“the heart of the renewed sun”—with the sun itself, which represented light, life and conscious- ness. The bennu reflected this synthesis of creative impulses in the form of a bird which is actually two birds. The Theosophical Glossary describes the bennu in terms of both the Shen-shen (heron) and the Rech (a red bird), both of which were sacred to Osiris: It was the latter that was the regular Phoenix of the great Mysteries, the typical symbol of self-creation and resurrection through death—a type of the Solar Osiris and of the divine Ego in man. Yet both the Heron and the Rech were symbols of cycles; the former, of the So - lar year of 365 days; the latter of the tropical year or a period covering almost 26,000 years. In both cases the cycles were the types of the return of light from dark - ness, the yearly and great cyclic return of the sun-god to his birth-place, or—his Resurrection. Hmmm... A 26,000-year cycle, associated with a red bird. Kinda like this one? Go Big Red!

The Sun-God Myth F or many occultists and Luciferians (as well as less notorious groups to be sure), it is viewed as common knowledge that the story of Christ is just that, a story—an ingenious anthropomorphic tale built upon the now not-so- secret secrets of the Mystery religions of the East. Christ played the part of the sun, the twelve disciples represented the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the en- tire yarn unfolded around the Sea of Galilee, with galilee meaning “the circuit” (or path of the earth through the ecliptic). The writers of the gospels had taken the as-above-so-below correspon- dence to its ultimate extent, linking every setting in their version of the classic sun-god myth to a real location (Bethlehem, “the House of Bread,” Virgo... forget it)—and contending that all of the characters in the story were, in fact, real people, with Jesus Christ as the living Son of God. Now, for those who don’t buy the take-it-on-faith argument that a flesh- and-blood redeemer ever walked the earth, certain facts become obvious during critical analysis of scripture. First is that the early church fathers went to great lengths to strip the canonical books of every last bit of their Jewishness, replacing YHWH with Lord in hundreds of instances, and altering the spell - ing of names so as to remove references to the Jewish god, Yahwey. “Yah” was used as a shortened version of the Jewish deity’s name, and at - tached to the beginning and end of many personal names. In numerous in- stances in the Bible where names today end with “iah,” they originally ended in “yah,” so that a person’s very name referenced their god. The person referred to as Jesus Christ was, in the original scriptures, called Yahshua Messiah, Yah-shua meaning “Yah saves” and Messiah meaning “the anointed one.” (There was even an Old Testament Yahshua. Hint: there was no letter “j” in Hebrew— Yoshua becomes Joshua, the spelling of which, as you might have guessed, was a liberty taken by early translators in the first place.) Thus do many non-believers contend that not only was there never an histor - ical “Jesus Christ,” as the name analysis yields, but that neither did a real “Yahshua M essiah”—the Sun, excuse me, Son of God, excuse me, Son of Yahwey—ever exist. Skull Hill W hat the hell has all this got to do with the megaritual, you might be thinking. Well, the second fact that becomes obvious in a critical anal - ysis of scripture is that the life of Christ does indeed unfold according to a heavenly design, only not some mysterious “plan of god,” but rather according to the life of the sun as it journeys through the sky."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"269 A H—ThThfitt B—ffifl—orfl Pdftff\u0014fio\u0013, T\u0014fi Td—ffflfi Cdft\u0012\u0012 rttTh \u0011\u0014fi Pdftff\u0014fio\u0013 ft\u0010 \u0011\u0014fi Lr\u0012\u0011 Pftfffi And here is where the tie-in to our Galactic MegaRitual occurs... The cross is an ancient symbol, by no means exclusive to Christianity, and quite often used in connection with the sun. A heavenly cross, or Great Cross, is said to be formed by the ecliptic, or the path of the sun through the sky, and the visible band of the Milky Way, or the Galactic Equator, the plane of our galaxy’s rotation around Galactic Center. Multiple symbols were used for Galactic Center, one being, as previously mentioned, a womb (the Womb of Creation, which, at least in our galaxy, it truly is), and another being a cosmic mountain—both owing to the mounded or domed shape of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Yet another symbol used for Galactic Center was, not surprisingly, the skull, with the celestial fea - ture looking very much like a skull cap. “Calvary” is Latin for “Golgotha,” which ac - cording to scripture means “Skull Hill.” The sun being suspended upon the Great Cross at Skull Hill, then, points to a very specific time: that in which our sun is aligned with the heart or cen- ter of the Milky Way—which by the way also has a visual feature that ancients likened unto a cave, or tomb. Christ’s crucifixion at Calvary, and subsequent burial in the tomb, is ac - cordingly viewed by many modern practitioners of the ancient Mystery reli - gions as a mythical anthropomorphic prophecy of Galactic Alignment—that very same phenomenon of which the Maya, and many others, were reportedly well aware. So at the heart of Christianity, one of the world’s greatest religions, is not only a myth, the Black Christmas conspirators would argue, but a prophecy as well, one fulfilled in our time , and which only they could fittingly commemo - rate. OMG. The Triple Cross A s the Gospels record, two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on either side, thus the three crosses often associated with Christianity. As - tronomically, in addition to the Great Cross, there is: Cygnus (the Latinized Hellenic Greek word for swan), lying on the plane of the Milky Way, which contains the Northern Cross; and, Crux (Latin for cross), with contains the Southern Cross—both of which are in close proximity to Galactic Center and lie on either side of the Great Cross."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"270 T—Th NThfitt 9/11? Compellingly, the Mayans also recognized two cross-shaped constellations in this same region (although they are not identical with Cygnus and Crux): “Xic,” the Hawk (hawk, swan, whatever) and The Thieves’ Cross (criminals, thieves, whatever)—both of which figured into Mayan myths focused on tell - ing the unfolding story of the heavens, past, present and future. Thus, again we find that the basis of the crucifixion story is rooted in the stars, but lest you get the mis - taken impression that the ancient Biblical writers and Mayans were the only ones interested in these things, consider that the long-awaited year of 2012 also brought the London Olympic Games, the 30 th Olympics, the XXX Olympiad, the Olym- piad of the Triple Cross. Indeed, just as Black Christmas marked the year of the Sun’s Crucifixion on the Great Cross— the middle of the three celestial crosses—so did the XXX Olympics commemorate this once-in-a-26,000-year occurrence. Also, for added effect, the “triple cross” might also be thought of as referring to the alignment of three other “crosses” involved in the alignment process: the three crosses formed by the equators and axes of the earth, sun and Milky Way, which all aligned in 2012. (Don’t think for a minute, either, that the triple-X pornographic connotation was overlooked or that great pleasure was not derived from the widespread use of the XXX label on everything from baseball caps to children’s lunchboxes.) Why in the world, then, didn’t the globalists roast up several hundred thousand Olympic spectators in honor of the occasion? Well, that would’ve spoiled the biggest Christmas Surprise in history, now, wouldn’t it? Come on, where’s your sense of timing, of theatre? (Not that there wasn’t a major psyop to convince the public that a nuclear strike on the Olympics was immiment, however, but that’s the subject of Chapter 25.)

Indeed Paul had alluded som- berly to “the smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary.” . .an oblique reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican.” According to Horn, Martin had concealed greater detail of this luciferic ‘enthronement ceremony’ in his novel, Windswept House , in which Martin wrote that “the Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer was effected within the Roman Catholic Citadel on June 29, 1963.” Horn further relates that “Martin stated publicly on more than one occasion that the enthronement of Lucifer in Rome was based on fact, and that to facilitate the black magic, a parallel ceremony was conduct - ed simultaneously in the United States in Charleston, South Carolina.” Horn continued: The reason this location was selected has remained obscure to many, but given what Mal- achi said about the Masonic connection, it makes sense that South Carolina was chosen: It is the site of the first Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the United States, called “the Mother Lodge of the World,” where in 1859, champion of luciferian dogma for the Masonic-Illuminatus, Albert Pike became Grand Commander of the Supreme Council, where he served the Order of the Quest until his death in Washington DC on April 2, 1892. Malachi Martin, again writing in his novel Windswept House , provides further details concerning the parallel enthronement ceremonies: Such unobtrusive elements as the Pentagram and the black candles and the appropriate drap - eries could be part of the Ceremonial in Rome. But other Ruberics—the Bowl of Bones and the R itual Din, for example, the sacrificial animals and the victim—would be too much. There would have to be a Parallel Enthronement. A Concelebration could be accomplished with the same effect by the Brethren in an Authorized Targeting Chapel. Provided all the participants in both locations “targeted” every element of the Event on the Roman Chapel, then the Event in its fullness would be accomplished specifically in the target area. It would all be a matter of unanimity of hearts, identity of intention and perfect synchronization of words and actions between the Targeting Chapel and the Target Chapel. The living wills and the thinking minds of the Participants concentrated on the specific Aim of the Prince would transcend all distance. Wow. A Concelebration in which the living wills and the thinking minds of the Participants concentrated on the specific Aim of the Prince would transcend all distance . Sort of like what President Bush, et al, did with The-Pet-Goat Ritual-Reading Black Mass in Sarasota in conjunction with Flight 175 slamming into the South Tower in New York, thereby invoking Crowley’s Liber 175 , “the book of Uniting to a particular Deity by de - votion.” I get it. However, this wouldn’t be the only time that a Concelebration for a major Luciferian event was held in Charleston, SC, home to the “Mother Lodge of the World.” ... you’ll have to wait until Chapter 22 to learn more about that."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"272 T—Th NThfitt 9/11? To be certain, it played brilliantly into the global jihad storyline—payback for the Crusades and all that—but the real genius in the Christmas Day killing of the Pope was that it paved the way for the fulfillment of the “Prophecy of the Last Pope.” (Incidentally, the last pope to die on Christmas Day was Pope Adrian I in 795; other individuals of note who passed away on this day include W.C. Fields, Charlie Chaplain, Dean Martin, Denver Pyle and James Brown.) According to St. Malachy’s “Prophecy of the Popes,” first published in 1595, the pope following Benedict XVI is the final pontiff, whose reign will mark the beginning of the great apostasy, which will be followed by the great tribulation. So bringing about the conditions which Catholics world-wide anticipate will accompany the apocalypse, or at least the begin - ning of the end, creates exactly the kind of atmosphere of tremendous fear and anticipation that the globalists are so adroit at exploiting to their great advantage. And wouldn’t you know it, the nuclear strike on Phoenix played directly into the Muslim eschatology involving the return of the 12 th Imam and the End of the World—the subject of the next chapter.

Jesus must be on his way back, but until he gets here we’ll mop the place up with them towelheads. The Islamic sheeple’s response was no less predictable: enthused to the point of insanity by what they believed to be a global victory for Islamic jihad carried out by blessed martyrs of Allah, they took to the streets by the millions to celebrate (only to get mowed down in droves by pissed-off Predator drone operators) and carried out untold acts of violence against Christian churches and businesses worldwide. Two global groups of religiously-inflamed mouth breathers ready to fight to the death in the name of God, be it Allah or Yahwey—just what the doctor ordered to create absolute chaos and help usher in a New World Order.

Pike’s Peek I n a letter purportedly from prominent Free- mason Albert Pike (1809-1891), whom you’ll remember from Most Dangerous , to Italy’s Giuseppe Mazzini (who conspiracy theorists claim was a 33 rd -degree Mason and became head of the Illuminati in 1834 and founder of the Mafia in 1860), Pike wrote: The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the dif - ferences caused by the “agentur” of the “Illuminati” between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other na - tions, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion... Pike continued, We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will extermi - nate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be with- out compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time. 1 Giuseppe Mazzini"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"276 TThff Nffflfi 9/11? Ah, yes, the true agenda is revealed; unfortunately, how - ever, as with Pike’s almost-cer - tainly fictitious Satanic “Pal - ladian Rite,” this letter is also a confirmed hoax. Yet, here again we must observe that just because it’s fake doesn’t mean it’s untrue: just because Léo Taxil claimed credit for the Palladian Rite hoax doesn’t mean there’s not a Luciferian core at the heart of Freema - sonry; likewise, just because Pike’s letter to Mazzini is a forgery doesn’t mean that it does not contain the Illuminati strategy for fomenting World War III, taking control of the entire planet and creating a One World Religion rooted in the worship of Lucifer. Actually, in hind sight, the letter seems pretty spot on, doesn’t it? Vigilant Guard B lack Christmas was successfully pulled off in Fortress America, with its bloated, hyper-vigilant, post-9/11 national security infrastructure. Not only that, it took place in the home state of the Secretary of Homeland Security, under the nose of America’s Toughest Sheriff, in Captain America’s back yard. Even better, Arizona’s other U.S. Senator, John Kyl, was the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. Not to mention that pre-B.C., Arizona itself ranked eighth of 50 states in the number of domestically-fo - cused counterterrorism and homeland security organi- zations, and 10th overall in organizations established or newly involved in counterterrorism since 9/11. Oh, and this should have been a tip off if anyone had been paying attention—remember on 9/11 that multiple military exercises were taking place, with one of the largest being “Vigilant Guardian”? Well, in 2011, Phoenix was the location of a drill simulating a nucle - ar terrorist attack. Its name? Vigilant Guard.

Chapter Fifteen Winning the War on Christmas N othing takes place in a vacuum, and Black Christmas was in signif - icant respects the culmination of the perpetual War on Christmas, which was itself but one front in the larger assault on Christianity and in the even-broader global effort to remove God not only from the public square but from the face of the planet. A Satanic Mass Sacrifice in Paradise Valley T he Phoenix Holocaust had been the Pearl Harbor (the new “New Pearl Harbor,” as 9/11 was often referred to) in the world-wide Luciferian war on the Christian faith—the biggest Christmas Day Surprise in history, an un- provoked attack that everyone again blamed on Muslim extremists. For the real perpetrators, it was truly “The Greatest Gift of All,” to themselves. Recalling from Most Dangerous that a black mass is, according to Church- of-Satan founder Anton LaVey, essentially a parody of a traditional religious ser - vice, and remembering President Bush’s Pet-Goat Black Mass in Paradise, we can better understand Black Christmas as the ultimate inversion of the Catholic Dawn Mass traditionally celebrated on Christmas Day—and see it for what it was, a Satanic Dawn Mass Sacrifice in Paradise Valley on X-Mas morn. It was a red hot Christmas...boy, talking about Santa leaving ashes for the children. A Stroll Down Bad-Memory Lane F lashback from the carnage of Phoenix for a moment to the 2004 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, where a slide show featuring quirky pho - tographs from inside the White House accompanies a portion of President Bush’s remarks.

Nope, no weapons over there ... maybe under here?”"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"278 Tffft Nft—tt 9/11? Democrats of course immediately seized upon his remarks, calling them “astonishingly insensitive.” Terry McAuliffe, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told ABC’s “Good Morning America,” “It’s inappropriate to the thousands of people obviously who have been wounded over there,” continuing, “This is a very serious issue. We’ve lost hundreds of troops, as you know, over there. Let’s not be laughing about not being able to find weapons of mass destruction.” The threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s alleged WMDs was cited by Bush administration officials, including Colin Powell, as one of the primary justifica - tions for going to war in Iraq—which resulted not only in thousands of Amer - ican killed, wounded and permanently maimed, but hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqi civilians. That no weapons were ever in fact discovered was blamed on “faulty intel - ligence,” but the real inside joke was that this supposed bad intelligence had been manufactured in the first place by those who stood to benefit from the war and had orchestrated 9/11 itself. When Mark Katz, a former speechwriter for President Clinton (who also wrote jokes for the former President’s own Correspondents’ Dinner appear - ances), told CNN in response to Bush’s comments, “sending American troops to war to find weapons of mass destruction, that’s a joke that’s playing out on the world stage,” he didn’t know the half of it. Bush wasn’t just making a highly-insensitive or inappropriate remark, he was mocking the press—and everyone else—to their faces. 1 “I will win the war on Christmas” N ow fast forward eight years from 2004 to the 2012 White House Correspondents’ Dinner in April, a mere eight months before Black Christmas, and we find President Barack Obama engaged in a little mockery of his own, only in this instance it was mockery-in-advance , part of the extensive predictive programming for the American Holocaust. Although no one at the time took much notice of the comment, in retro - spect it was one heckuva hint—actually, it was an outright declaration of his intentions. During his monologue, Obama joked, “Now, if I do win a second term as President, let me just say something to all the — (applause) — let me just say something to all my conspiracy-oriented friends on the right who think I’m planning to unleash some secret agenda: You’re absolutely right.”"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"279 Wffftftffft— ttThfi Wffi\u0018 \u0017ft CTh\u0018ff\u0016tt\u0015ffi\u0016 More applause.

After waiting for applause, he cues up another one: “In my first term,” Obama began, “we ended the war in Iraq”; then, “In my second term,” he paused, “I will win the war on Christmas.” I will win the war on Christmas ... Some Heads Are Gonna Roll J udas Priest was one of the premiere heavy metal acts of the 1970s and 80s, performing such head-banging classics as “Living After Midnight,” one of the bands most popular songs. Starting out with the oft-repeated lines, “Livin’ after midnight, rockin’ to the dawn. Lovin’ till the mornin’, then I’m gone, I’m gone,” the tune thrilled millions upon millions of leathered-up biker types and tough guys the world over for decades. It was quite interesting, then, when former lead singer Rob Halford came out of the closet in 1998 as the first openly-gay heavy metal star, and subsequently revealed that “Living After Midnight” had actually been written as a cryptic tribute to San Francisco’s gay bar scene. Halford, who lived in Paradise Valley, AZ, just outside Phoenix, had earlier in his career— and quite deliciously—sung for the bands Lord Lucifer and Hiroshima, and thus it was a logical development that Judas Priest’s classic “Some Heads Are Gonna Roll” became a sort of anthem for Black Christmas, a very-much intentional parallel with 9/11’s official battle-cry, “Let’s roll” (Priest’s “Screamin’ for Vengeance” came in a close second). “Some Heads Are Gonna Roll” lyrics excerpt: The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth, Will show how little they think you’re worth. With animal lust they’ll devour your life, And slice your world to bits like a knife. One last day, burning hell fire. You’re blown away... You know, though, you sort of get the impression that maybe this song isn’t what every- one thought it was, either. It sounds less like the “we’re gonna kick some ass” that the title seems to imply and everyone infers, and more like the “you got your ass kicked” mockery we keep getting in one form after another. Shit, yet another perfectly good Judas Priest classic ruined for posterity."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11? Chapter Sixteen A Companion Ritual I t was the only good news of the day that fateful Christmas morning: Presi - dent Obama would live—not only that, he would make a full recovery. He had looked increasingly thin in the months leading up to Black Christmas, and rumors swirled about his health. Was it simply the stress of campaigning for reelection? Then, on December 21 st , 2012, had come the news reports: the President had been rushed to Bethesda Naval Hospital and was in a coma; there was even speculation that he might even be brain dead. Yet, only three days later, in the midst of wall-to-wall coverage of the Phoe- nix attack, had come the unexpectedly positive report from Obama’s doctors. It was a ray of hope on an otherwise dark day—a miracle some called it. Obama had been resurrected, reborn like the Phoenix ... hey, wait a minute... that, too, was part of the Black Christmas Galactic MegaRitual? An Election of Biblical Proportions I n the lead-up to Obama’s 2008 election and immediately afterwards, many seemed to lose all perspective, if not their grip on reality altogether. On MSNBC , Chris Matthews exclaimed, “This is bigger than Kennedy.... This is the New Testament! I felt this thrill going up my leg.” In Politico , Jesse Jackson Jr. remarked that “The event itself is so extraordi - nary that another chapter could be added to the Bible to chronicle its signif - icance,” and in The Free Liberal Micah Tillman predicted: “He won’t just heal our city-states and souls. He won’t just bring the Heavenly Kingdom—dreamt of in both Platonism and Christianity—to earth. He will heal the earth itself.” With such Messianic rhetoric, it was no surprise when an inaugural pa - rade in Des Moines, Iowa, featured a re-enactment of the triumphal entry of Christ with a facsimile of Obama riding on a donkey and onlookers waving palm branches. As things would turn out, though, these folks couldn’t have been any more mistaken."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"282 T—Th NThttft 9/11? The Obama Psyop T he person of Barack Hussein Obama and his Presidency may have been one of the biggest on-going psyops ever mounted against the American and global public, filled to the brim with that same familiar always-present mockery, more out-in-front than ever. The clues and cues were so robust it’s ridiculous, rivaled only by the general public’s refusal to even take notice, de- spite the fact that they were hit repeatedly in the face with one absurdity after another. From the millions spent on attorneys’ fees to keep all his records—kin- dergarten through college—sealed from public view, to Obama’s not placing his hand over his heart during the singing of the National Anthem (on more than one occasion), from the suspicion-generating elements of his birth cer - tificates), to an equally suspicious selective service registration form and the apparent use of multiple social security numbers, one could surmise that the man was, by design , a walking, talking conspiracy-theory generator. Karma Chameleon W as the Obama image an ingeniously media-crafted chameleon, created to be many things to many groups? For Christians, there was ample evidence that he was a closet Muslim (in one interview, he supposedly misspoke, using the phrase “my Muslim faith,” whereupon the interviewer corrected him, “Your Christian faith,” which Obama merely parroted, “My Christian faith”); for patri - otic conservatives, ample evidence that he was a socialist-communist subversive; for C hristian apocalyptics, evidence that Obama was in fact the long-awaited an - ti-Christ. Having been fed a steady diet of political-correctness indoctrination for decades, had Americans been in such a rush to elect an African American as president that they had unwittingly—and with immense enthusiasm and total consent—installed a socialist-communist-Muslim-non-citizen in the highest office in the land? And then the dark beauty of using a constitutional law professor—es - pecially one held to be closely affiliated with communist, serial-bomber and co-founder of the Weather Underground, Bill Ayers—to destroy the Constitu- tion would be an act of genius unto itself.

Obama later gave his acceptance speech for the Democratic Party’s nomination on a stage that some believed to be inspired by the Pergamon Altar, which Obama had re- portedly visited while in Berlin. This altar had been the model for the Zeppelintribüne , the Tribune at Zeppelin Field in Nuremberg that Hitler used for his Nazi rallies. Take Two: After Chief Justice John Roberts “accidentally” flubbed the words to the oath of office during the swearing-in ceremony, the ceremony was repeated in the Map Room of the White House, only the second time it was conducted without the use of the Holy Bible— and directly in front of a portrait of Freemasonic architect Benjamin Latrobe.

Man o’ war: After less than two weeks in office, Obama was nominated for and subsequently received the Nobel Peace Prize, when obviously at the time of his nomination he hadn’t done anything to deserve the prize— particularly ironic, given that this Man of Peace proceeded to continue existing wars and order new acts of aggression by the military, not to men- tion to win the war on Christmas ...but that was all ... an inside joke? A Reinforcing Ritual O bama’s staged illness and miraculous Christmas day recovery had been a companion ritual to the Mass Sacrifice of Black Christmas. The Pres - ident of the World, the globalists’ Sun King—the earthly counterpart of the sun itself—for all intents and purposes died, mirroring the death of the sun occurring on Winter Solstice (when the sun reaches the lowest point in the sky during its annual journey through the heavens), and he had remained in death"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"284 T—Th NThttft 9/11? for three days before being resurrected on December 25, exactly as the sun remains at its lowest point for three days before beginning its upward journey. The location of Obama’s “death” had been symbolically significant, as well, with his collapse occurring directly underneath the Capitol Dome, which rep- resented the Cosmic Womb of Galactic Center—an earthly reenactment of the heavenly demise of the sun in the heart of creation, prelude to the ultimate regenerative act. And, speaking of regeneration, don’t forget the Washington Monument, standing opposite the Capitol, a massive modern-day representa - tion of the phallus of Osiris, magically imbuing the Womb of Isis and the entire ceremony with supernatural procreative vitality. (Another XXX megaritual!) This was not simply a ritual mirroring the annual rebirth of the sun, and it didn’t concern entry into a new Zodiacal house. No, this was the Birth of the Sun of the New Great Age, and the resurrected Obama-Osiris had been reborn in all his full glory as its flesh-and-blood representative. Lucifer Ascended C hosen in part for his physical characteristics and looking for all the world like an Egyptian Pharaoh, Obama was on one lev - el transformed into Osiris resurrected. Lest you balk a t the idea, recall Obama’s own words as he toured Egyptian archaeological sites accompanied by Dr. Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian Minister of State for Antiquities: looking at a hieroglyph of a large-eared individual, who was in fact non-royalty, the President remarked, “That looks like me. Look at those ears.” However, moments later, Dr. Hawass made the key comparison, com- menting on Obama’s resemblance to the most well-known Egyptian ruler of all: “Mr. President, you look like King Tut,” he said, to which Obama replied, “I’ve been told.” Dr. Hawass punctuated his observation—“It’s true.” (Egyp - tians were so inspired that they created plaques inscribed with “Obama: New Tutankhamon of the World.”) On a deeper level still, to the hard-core Luciferians behind the B.C. MegaRitual, the New King Tut also represented the embodiment of the spirit of the New Great Age, the Age of Lucifer: the resurrected Obama was on one level the anti-Christ himself. They had ritually accomplished the ultimate sacrilege: The Birth of the Anti-Christ on Christmas Day. Publicly, of course, the ritual was all perfectly believable for the vast major - ity of the unwashed masses: Obama’s illness had caused a change in his person- ality, and not for the better."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11?

As with the abrupt reversal from Most Dangerous , 9-1-1=help à 9/11=terror, here you have an equally-clever subconscious re- versal of meaning intended to create cognitive dis - sonance: Osama=bad guy à Obama=good guy + Saddam Hussein=bad guy à Barack Hussein=good guy.

What’s in a Name, Part II: He is with us W riting in his book Apollyon Rising 2012 , author Thomas Horn states: A Hadith (tradition) sacred to Shiite Islam from the seventeenth cen- tury contains a prophecy from Ali ibn Abi-Talib, which predicts that just"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"286 T—fi NfittTh 9/11? before the return of the Mahdi (the end-times redeemer of Islam) a “tall black man will assume the reins of government in the West.” This leader will command “the strongest army on earth” and will bear “a clear sign” from the third imam, Hussein . The prophecy concludes that: “Shiites should have no doubt that he is with us .” Does this Islamic prophecy identify Obama as the “promised warrior” who comes to help the savior of Shiite Muslims conquer the world? Amir Taheri asked this very question for Forbes Magazine in October 2008, pointing out how “Obama’s first and second names—Barack Hus - sein—mean ‘the blessing of Hussein’ in Arabic and Persian” while his “family name, Obama, written in the Persian alphabet, reads O Ba Ma, which means ‘he is with us,’ the magic formula in Majlisi’s tradition.” “He is with us,” eh? Very interesting, if true, considering that the name of the Messiah as prophesied by Isaiah was Immanuel, “God is with us.” (And worth noting is that Al-Burāq, meaning “lightning,” is the name of the myth- ological steed that carried Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and back during his famed “Night Journey.”) What’s in a Name, Part III: Amen Ra is Back I n the end, perhaps what awakened the greatest number of people to Obama as the creation of the globalists and his role as their Sun King was the timely revelation of what had obviously been an intentional formulation, one that had clearly played a role in the selection of the name for this CIA-Hollywood-cre- ated character in the first place. Ingeniously, “Barack Hussein Obama” contained an anagram which was an outright statement that he was indeed the occult Sun King reborn: “Amen Ra is back BHO USA” . . .

Io Saturnalia W hile we’re on the subject of Saturn, Saturnalia was the ancient Roman festival honoring the deity of the same name, originally held on Decem- ber 17 th and later expanded with unofficial festivities through December 23 rd , the poet Catullus calling them “the best of days.” Characterized overall by social role reversals, behavioral license, drunken- ness and gluttony, Saturnalia featured a day of gift-giving on December 23 rd , often involving gag gifts, of which Julius Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of the Roman Empire, was particularly fond. Such gifts might be expensive or quite cheap, and included items such as toothpicks, spoons and sausages. In the spirit of Saturnalia, then, one supposes, and seeking to incorporate the glorious goat into the Galactic Megaritual in some darkly-humorous and fitting manner, the conspirators chose to have delivered anonymously via FedEx on December 24 th to the homes of numerous U.S. and Arizona public officials—including Joe Arpaio, Jan Brewer, John McCain, and Jon Kyl—the cutest damn cellophane-wrapped straw Yule Goats you’ve ever seen. Enclosed with these oversized Christmas ornaments were, quite oddly, thought many of the recipients, packs of Atomic Fireball Hard Candy, boxes of dates (from the date palm tree, Phoenix dactylifera ), and boxes of Hanukkah candles (44 to a box). There had been much discussion about including packets of Phoenix mush- rooms, but it was decided that this would just be too damn weird— but they couldn’t let the mushroom thing go (had to have a mushroom cloud reference, you know), and ended up throwing in a little miniature red-and-white felt toy mushroom, complete with a silk green bow, with each package. (It was similarly decided that bottles of Vicks Formula 44 would be too peculiar to include, and might be a bit of overkill anyway.)

Before the finale, then, we visit Tucson, Arizona, and Aurora, Colorado, separated by hundreds miles, but connected to both 9/11 and Black Christmas through perverse occult rituals you’ll have to pick apart to believe...but, sadly, we’re used to that by now, aren’t we?"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11?

U.S Representative Gabrielle Giffords is holding a “Congress on Your Corner” event in front of the Safeway supermarket located at 7110 North Or - acle Road (Arizona Highway 77) in La Toscana Village mall in Casas Adobes, Arizona, an unincorporated town ne ar Tucson. Approximately 30 people are gathered around the Congresswoman’s table or are standing in line to visit with her, when, at 10:10 a.m., 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner pulls out a 9mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol—with a 33-round magazine—shoots Giffords in the head, and proceeds to shoot 18 others, six of whom will die, including Arizona District Court Chief Judge John Roll, Con- gressional staffer Gabriel Zimmerman and 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. President Obama called the shooting an “unspeakable tragedy,” adding that “such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society,” and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack “senseless and cruel violence.” Numerous politicians and public figures issued statements, including Ari - zona’s Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Jus - tice John Roberts, who couldn’t accurately recite the Presidential oath of office in 2009, managed to issue a coherent statement of his own, noting, “we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own,” referring to the death of Chief Judge John Roll. Never Mind that Rifle V arious foreign officials, including Fidel Castro, commented on the inci - dent, and the French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm “an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence.”"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"296 Tff— N—ttfi 9/11? Thus began yet another scripted round of heated recriminations in the per - petual left-right mock battle for the public’s fickle affections (in itself mere the- atre, to wit, the whole Sarah-Palin-and-the-crosshairs routine, which, if you’re unfamiliar with it, isn’t worth going into detail on), and thus was more fuel spewed upon the ever-smoldering gun-control controversy, reigniting it into a full-blown conflagration once again. With all of the script elements kicking into full play, then, no one really took any notice when, despite the mainstream media’s relentless billing of the shooting as yet another senseless lone-wolf killing in America, Pima County Sheriff ’s Deputy Rich Kastigar told reporters that a rifle with an extended mag - azine had been found at the scene of the shooting spree. 1 Details? Who the hell wants details that don’t fit into the pre-established storyline? Shut the hell up, Rich. A Deeper Look W hether the rifle was a second weapon that Loughner brought to the scene but didn’t use (which wasn’t part of the reporting, by the way), or a weapon left behind by a second shooter (unconfirmed reports indicated that the weapon had been found on the roof of the Safeway), or a prop planted to generate confusion and suspicion (as we see time and again in our investiga - tions), this detail matters in that it’s exactly the kind of incongruent factoid that we have come to recognize as potential-probable evidence of sophisticated psychological warfare tactics being employed against the unsuspecting public. While not definitive in and of itself, it says, Look deeper.

Indeed, this ritual was a warm-up performance designed to focus nation- al and international attention on Arizona in general and the Tucson-Phoenix area specifically—a means of generating mass sympathy and empathy tied sub - consciously, perhaps psychically, to this geographic location, and intended, if it were possible, to compound the psychological trauma of the holocaust to come—a dress rehearsal involving the key players for 12/25/12 (whether all of them knew it at the time or not). It incorporates elements and themes from 9/11 and points symbolically toward Phoenix. A Being From of Old Am I J anus was the animistic spirit of doorways ( januae ) and archways ( jani ), the god of gates as well as the guardian deity of non-physical boundaries, espe- cially the threshold between one year and the next. He was the god of begin- nings and endings, transitions and time (recall the similar functions of Hermes and Thoth from the 9/11 Occult MegaRitual). In Lawful Days (Fasti), Book 1, Ovid quotes Janus as saying “The ancients called me Chaos, for a being from of old am I ... all things are closed and opened by my hand. The guardianship of this vast universe is in my hands alone.” 2 Janus is the first of the gods and thus their father. Men must invoke Janus first, regardless of the god they want to pray to or placate. Janus as the Gatekeeper has jurisdiction over every kind of door and passage and the power of opening or closing them. Janus is at the origin of time as the guardian of the gates of Heaven, and possesses mastership over time—he is the initiator of new historical ages. Nothing could have been more fitting than to invoke Janus at the doorstep of Phoenix on the cusp of the roll-over to the Next Great Age. January 8: The Eve of Agony A n Agonalia or Agonia was a religious observance celebrated in ancient Rome several times a year in honor of various divinities, and the January 9 th Agonalia was the Festival of Janus, during which sacrifices were made to the god. Also known as the Agonium, it was a celebration of doors and gateways symbolized by Janus in ascendancy after the winter solstice. January 8 th (which fell on Saturday in 2011) was the eve of the Agonium (the word agonium also referred to the sacrificial beast or victim, or, in this instance, victims)."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"298 Tff— N—ttfi 9/11? The Arch of Janus and The Royal Arch of Freemasonry B efitting of the god of gateways and archways, there is a literal Arch of Janus in the Forum Boarium in Rome, the only remaining example of the quadrifrons triumphal arch preserved there. The arch is also a highly significant symbol in Freemasonry as evidenced by their Royal Arch (or Holy Royal Arch) degree, which derives its name from the “Royal Arch of the Ages of the Zo - diac,” where the twelve Zodiacal constellations— representing the twelve ages in the Precession of the Equinoxes (or the Great Age)—appear to arch their way across the sky as if in royal procession. The Royal Arch ritual purportedly attempts to convey a picture of the life hereafter, of our re-integration with the Supreme Being, but it’s highly doubtful that our idea of the Most High is in line with the upper-echelon Freemasons’ God (whether that be the Mason’s “Jahbulon,” who in- cidentally is depicted looking a lot like Yoda from Star Wars, or Lucifer himself ).

Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, and his brother Scott are, in fact, the only twins (the only siblings, for that mat - ter) to have both traveled in space. At the time of the shooting Scott Kelly was serving as commander aboard the Internation - al Space Station, from which he led a National M oment of Silence for the victims of the Tucson shooting. At 220 miles above the Earth, this went from being a global public ritual to an Outer Space MegaRitual, quite fitting given that Black Christmas was to be in essence a Galactic MegaRitual. Paging Dr. Bowman S cott Kelly’s first spaceflight was as pilot of the Space Shuttle Discovery , which was also the name of the spaceship on which Dr. David Bowman made his fateful journey in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (recall the Millennium Monolith from the first book) on his way to crossing through the stargate ( Janus!) and becoming the Starchild. Bowman’s character appears in the sequel to 2001 , entitled 2010: The Year We Make Contact , as well as in two additional books by Arthur C. Clarke, 2061: Odyssey Three and 3001: The Final Odyssey . In the for - ward to 2061 , Clarke points out that the plots of the movies and books do not follow a lin- ear arc and take place in parallel universes. Consequently, there are apparent inconsistencies in Bowman’s character throughout the series, and his dual identities are referred to, albeit infrequently, as being “twin astronauts” (identical twins perhaps?). Speaking of 2001 and twins, be careful not to confuse the fictitious Dr. Bowman with Dr. David Bowman the Tucson physician, who was picking up a few items in Safeway when the shooting began, and rushed out to help tend the wounded. “Bowman,” by the way, is an encoded reference to the constellation Sagittarius, the bow-man or archer, one of the guardians of Galactic Center (along with Scorpio), whose arrow points directly at the center of the Milky Way."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"300 Tff— N—ttfi 9/11? The 9/11 Birthday Girl O ne of those who unfortunately didn’t survive the shooting was 9-year-old Christina Taylor-Green of Tucson, newly elected to the student council at her school.

I never hold back.”) and daughter of John Green, a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers; she was also the niece of actress Sophia Bush.

As reported in the Arizona Republic , Christina’s uncle, Greg Segalini, stated that a neighbor had invited the young girl to the event simply because she thought Christina, new member of the student council and all, would enjoy it. Turns out that this neighbor who took the 9/11 Birthday Girl by the hand and led her off to her slaughter was one Susan Hileman, a 1973 graduate of Cornell University’s College of Human Ecology and mem- ber of the Human Ecology Alumni Association Board. (Giffords was also a Cornell alum.) Hileman was shot three times but survived and was one of the main victims treated by Dr. David Bowman.

Those recruited under this program included rocket engineer Wernher von Braun, the chief architect of the Saturn V launch vehicle that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. Also brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip was Dr. Hubertus Strughold, a German-born physiologist and prominent medical researcher, who played a pioneering role in the study of the physical and psychological effects of manned spaceflight and became known as “The Father of Space Medicine.” Following his death, Strughold’s activities under the Nazis came under increased scrutiny, and allegations of involvement in human experimentation—in which camp inmates were immersed in freezing water, placed in pressure chambers and forced to drink seawater—at the Dachau concentration camp greatly diminished his reputation. In May 2006, Strughold’s name was removed from the International Space Hall of Fame by unani - mous vote of the New Mexico Museum of Space History’s board of directors. (Strughold even made a post-hu - mus appearance in The X-Files as the character of Victor Klemper in the 1995 episode “Paper Clip.”) S o, as you can see, things didn’t always go so well with this Employ-a-Nazi program, and there could be a much worse, yet generally unknown, case involving the U.S. government’s utilization of a former Nazi doctor. Mind-control programming is often called Monarch programming and is sometimes referred to inter - changeably as “Green programming.” Thousands of mind-control victims in the U.S. report having a “Dr. Green” as their chief pr ogrammer, and at least some of these subjects indicate that certain experiments were conduct - ed at facilities in the desert surrounding Tucson (others say Cornell University, as well). Dr . Green also purportedly went by the names Dr. Greenbaum, Greentree, Greenberg, etc., and may or may not be one-in-the-same with Dr. L. Wilson Greene, the one-time Scientific Director of the Chemical and Radio - logical Laboratories at the Army Chemical Center. Tad Szulc, in “The CIA’s Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” ( Psychology T oday , November 1977), writes that the “man whom the CIA documents credit with inspiring the program is Dr. L. Wilson Greene of the Army Chemical Corps, who had long urged the United States to embark upon psy - chochemical warfare.” 1 Whether Dr. Green is Dr. Greene or not, one very interesting theory surrounding the development of the United States governments’ mind-control program is that Dr. Green’s true identity is that of ex-Auschwitz doctor and “Angel of Death” Joseph Mengele. Menge - le (who incidentally had a particular interest in identical twins) conducted one of the first methodical studies on trauma-based mind contr ol and is thought by some to be one of the principle developers of Monarch Programming and the CIA’s MK-Ultra program. Hell, he certainly has the credentials. 2 Writing in The Relationship Between Mind Control Programming and Ritual Abuse , Dr. El - len P. Lacter further defines what we’re talking about here: T rauma-based mind control programming can be defined as systematic torture that blocks the victim’s capacity for conscious processing (through pain, terror, drugs, illusion, sensory depri - vation, sensory over-stimulation, oxygen deprivation, cold, heat, spinning, brain stimulation, and of ten, near-death), and then employs suggestion and/or classical and operant condition- ing (consistent with well-established behavioral modification principles) to implant thoughts, dir ectives, and perceptions in the unconscious mind, often in newly-formed trauma-induced dissociated identities, that force the victim to do, feel, think, or perceive things for the purpos - es of the programmer. The objective is for the victim to follow directives with no conscious a wareness, including execution of acts in clear violation of the victim’s moral principles, spiritual convictions, and volition. Installation of mind control programming relies on the victim’s capacity to dissociate, which permits the creation of new walled-off personalities to “hold” and “hide” programming. Already dissociative children are prime “candidates” for programming. To achieve this objective, programmers use a variety of horrific means, including forced sodomy, which in children can produce vaso-vagal shock and aid tremendously in splitting their personality. And while we’re on the subject of the horrible things adults do to children, would it be—given everything else we’ve discovered about this ritual and the others regarding name games, tributes, tips-of-the-hat, and pure mockery, as well as the use of mind-control techniques—too inappropriate to ask whether Christina-Taylor Green’s last name was a purposeful reference to “Dr. Green,” and, perhaps, the “Angel of Death” himself, Joseph Mengele? One argument that absolutely cannot be raised against this line of inquiry is that it’s too sick or twisted, because, as we’ve learned by now, there’s nothing these baby-killing, child-raping sadistic Satanists won’t do. 1 http://cognitiveliberty.tribe.net/thread/2ed1e3fb-e9d6-4e73-8363-ec2bd94e0ab0 2 http://secretarcana.com/hiddenknowledge/monarch-programming-mind-control/#fn-197-1"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"302 Tff— N—ttfi 9/11?

(Interesting, that in his mug shot following the shooting, Loughner looked like he’d been on the receiving end of a massive dose of some psychotropic drug.) There is other potential evidence that Lough- ner might have been the victim of a mind-control operation, but in the interests of keeping this as brief as possible and to avoid the tedium of having to sort through it all—in the end, there’s no defini- tive proof, anyway, as is many times the case in situ- ations like this—ask yourself this: if you were plan- ning an occult public ritual and needed to make sure that your assassin showed up on location, on time and able to put bullets on target, would you not use whatever pharmacological and behavior-modification tools and tech- niques were at your disposal to insure a flawless performance?

Christians and Muslims alike believe him to have foretold the births of John the Baptist to Zacha - rias and Jesus to the Virgin Mary. Muslims further believe that Gabriel was the me - dium through which God revealed the Quran to Muhammad over a period of 23 y ears—and also accompanied the Prophet on his “Night Journey”—and hold that Gabriel sent messages to most, if not all the prophets revealing their obligations. In Jewish belief, Gabriel, as the Power of God, is regarded as the angel of judgment, and many Christians likewise believe that Ga - briel will blow a sacred trumpet to signal the Last Judg - ment (quite appropriate, as 2012 was held to mark the End of the Age). Thus, although the primary affront was intended for the followers of Christ, this aspect of the Tuc - son Outer-Space MegaRitual in the end turned out to be an equal-opportunity insult to all three of the world’s great religions. To recap, then, the globalists popped a cap in the Mes - senger of God, who delivered the good news to Mary and is supposed to blow the Trumpet of the Apocalypse: this was the symbolic Killing of Gabriel, prefiguring the sym- bolic Killing of Christ affected on 12/25/12.

Christian author Texe Marrs refers to the “Janus Factor,” which he asserts is the “Illuminati secret formula for world revolution and deceit”—“Satan’s hid - den method.” (According to others, there also supposedly exists a super-secret organization called the Janus Group that utilizes highly-trained psychic assas - sins to eliminate enemies of the Illuminati—good luck confirming that one.) Marrs contends that “throughout history, Janus operatives...have success - fully employed the Janus method to psychically and culturally churn global events and overturn all standards of morality and human dignity.” Janus-faced, two-faced: deceitful, treacherous, devious; saying one thing and doing another (Orwell’s Newspeak, doublespeak), altering meanings to confound and con- fuse—you know, the standard operating procedure of the globalists.

Former neuroscience doctoral candidate James Eagan Holmes (born December 13, 1987), dressed in full-body protective armor and a gas mask, had allegedly entered a midnight screening of the latest Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, let loose with a couple of tear-gas gre- nades, and then opened fire on the audience with a variety of weap - ons, including an assault rifle and a shotgun—shooting or other - wise injuring over seventy people, killing 12 of those (13 if you count the fetus of the victim who miscar - ried as a result of her injuries).

The shooting had taken place in Colora - do, in a city named Aurora (which, by way, is"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"307 T—fl Jffififl’Th Off UTh the birthplace of Skull & Bones member and 2004 Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry, as well as the home of Buckley Air Force Base). Unfor - tunately, many Americans would only have recog - nized that name as belonging to the Marvel Comics character who is the sister of Northstar and the for - mer lover of Sasquatch (she has also had a relation- ship with Wild Child)—or, God forbid, as the title character from Disney’s Sleeping Beauty . Aurora, however, is also the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn. In Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (I.i), Montague says of his lovesick son Romeo But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from the light steals home my heavy son...

They might have even come to the realization that the entire incident had nothin g whatsoever to do with Batman, and everything to do with keeping them in a state of constant fear and confusion. But such was not to be. No, Seriously I n retrospect, it probably would have been just way too much to ask of the general public to get their faces out of their iPhones and iPads and consider the date on which the slaughter occurred. Having already missed the Mother of Lu- cifer and the Trickster, why would they have bothered to notice that July 20 th is, on the Satanic calendar, the start of the Grand Climax, which, among other things, requires human sacrifice? I mean, there are all the in- gredients for a nice public ritual sitting out on the ta - ble, and everyone just walks right past asking, What’s for supper? Since they didn’t have a clue about The Joker as a mind-control program- ming tool, they had no idea that when James Holmes told police that he was The Joker, he was entirely seri - ous. He wasn’t referring to the Batman villain, or even Suspicious Minds H olmes was allegedly dressed as a police SWAT offi- cer—the bad guy dressed as one of the good guys, an intentional and purposefully-harmful reversal of ex - pectations and meaning (where have we seen that be - fore?)—except that the assailant was also wearing a gas mask. No one actually saw his face as he did the shooting. In any case, movie goers had at first assumed that the figure dressed in black battle gear was part of some special gimmick related to the movie, until, that is, he began firing live rounds. Confuse them, defy their expecta- tions, then slaughter them . Of course, the classic reports of multiple shooters emerged almost immediately from eyewitnesses, con- flicting with official accounts of a lone-wolf assassin. How ironic, too, various observers commented, that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history took place less than 20 miles from Columbine, site of the deadliest shooting at an American high school. Yeah, what a f*cking coincidence. It was probably just happenstance, too, that the shooting took place less than 20 miles from the Denver International Airport, which with its bizarre murals and Masonic symbols, plays a key role in many New World Order conspiracy theories (according to some, there are miles of secret tunnels and numerous well-appointed bunkers beneath the airport). Aurora, gateway city to Den- ver, Capitol of the New World Order? Finally, recalling the multiple drills on both 9/11 and 7/7 that involved wildly-similar, if not identical, scenarios to those which unfolded (and, in a number of instances, the actual locations where the real events occurred), you won’t be at all surprised to learn that on the same day that the Aurora massacre took place, Rocky Vista Univer - sity College of Osteopathic Medicine in nearby Parker, Colorado, held specialized classes in disaster life-support for 150 second-year medical students that included the scenario of a mass shooting at a movie theater. “The irony is amazing, just amazing,” commented Rocky Vista Dean Dr. Bruce Dubin in an interview following the shooting.

Involuntary Participants? A s with Jared Loughner, the alleged shooter in the Gabby Giffords inci- dent, the suspect in this case didn’t simply look psychotic, but had the appearance and behavior of someone who’d been pumped full of a cocktail of psychotropic drugs. In his police photo and in subsequent court appearances, Holmes appeared to be completely dissociated from reality. He had reportedly been seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Lynne Fenton, to whom Holmes sent a notebook containing all sorts of incriminating writings and draw - ings (how convenient). The doctor he rself apparently had an interesting background, as well, with some con - spiracy researchers claiming that she h ad connections with government mind-control programs. (If you’ll recall, Loughner was near-obsessed with the subject of government mind control and appeared to be drugged out of his gourd in his own mug shot.) In light of these observations, it is of particular interest that in No - vember 2011, lawyers for al - leged assassin Sirhan Sirhan argued in feder - al court that he “was an involun- tary participant in the crimes being committed because he was subject - ed to sophisticated hypno program- ming and memory implantation techniques which rendered him un- Movies and Mind Control: A Brief History L. Frank Baum, author of The Wizard of Oz , was an ardent occultist and an initiate in the Theosophic Society, and his tale of Doro - thy and Toto was rich in esoteric references and occult symbology. So much so, in fact, that if conspiracy theorists’ descriptions of U.S. intelli- gence mind-control programs (such as MK-Ul- tra, Project Bluebird, etc.) are accurate, the film was one of a number of motion pictures cho - sen to provide a thematic foundation for their trauma-based mind-control experiments in the 1940s (and beyond). The Wizard of Oz , and other similar films such as Alice in Wonderland , are reportedly used by programmers to create a “common program- ming matrix” utilizing the movies’ themes, im- agery and music. Often referred to as Monarch programming, this approach allows handlers to create triggers in subjects’ minds enabling ac- cess to multiple levels of their personality, which have been split through a process known as dissociation—the result of systematic and high- ly-traumatic physical and psychological torture, often involving terrifying occult rituals. “Over the rainbow,” or “through the looking glass,” is where the subjects must go in order to escape the un- bearable pain being inflicted upon them. Once a split in the core personality is achieved, alter personas can be programmed through audio and visual aids."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"310 T—fl Nflffifi 9/11? able to consciously control his thoughts and actions at the time the crimes were being committed,” according to court papers. So if Loughner or Holmes wants to lodge a complaint about being forcibly subjected to mind-control techniques, they’ll have to get in line behind Sirhan, who’s been there quite a while. Please pass the Haldol. Conspiracies’r’us T he plethora of conspiracy theories that have already cropped up around this incident is seemingly indicative (as with other black ops, including 9/11) of misinformation and disinformation campaigns associated with psy - chological warfare. Sure, there probably are genuine tantalizing and ingenious - ly-devised connections to a variety of suspicion-arousing government agencies and educational institutions, but the sheer number of the conspiracy theories would also tend to support the presence of an active nonsense-dissemination program. Without attempting to determine the validity or significance of the fol - lowing claims in any way, we can note in advance the presence of numerous pieces of information that do seem to fit within the pattern of evidence and/or disinformation surrounding similar events: •\t James Holmes had been a research intern at the Salk Institute at the University of California at San Diego, which had previously partnered with DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) on projects related to DARPA’s “Peak Soldier Performance Program.” Some consider this “Super Soldier” program as part of a broader, secretly-co - ordinated effort that is moving the world ever-closer towards an era of trans-humanism. •\t Holmes’ paternal grandfather had connections to the CIA through the Army Language School, now the Defense Language Institute. •\t Dan Oates, Aurora’s chief of police at the time of the massacre, worked as head of intelligence for the New York Police Department up until al - most immediately before the attacks of September 11, 2001. •\t Holmes went to tremendous effort to rig his entire apartment with nu- merous explosive devices (including more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline), then very uncharacteristically left loud music"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"311 T—fl Jffififl’Th Off UTh playing, ostensibly to annoy neighbors and attract the authorities, who would then be blown to smithereens. Yet, when apprehended, Holmes told police that he had booby-trapped his apartment (he shoots 70 peo - ple and then has a change of heart?) •\t James Holmes’ father, Robert, was involved with fraud investigation, loosely paralleling a plotline in The Dark Knight Rises in which the char - acter Bane secures software that he uses to expose Wall Street fraud. Robert Holmes was supposedly scheduled to testify before Congress on a major banking scandal (pphhht), and also worked earlier in his career for HNC, a company with DARPA connections (hmmm). •\t Holmes reportedly told police that he’d taken 100mg of the painkiller Vicodin before the shootings. This same drug was found in the blood of actor Heath Ledger, who portrayed The Joker in The Dark Knight , fol - lowing what was officially determined to be an accidental overdose in 2008 (conspiracy theorists think otherwise, but of course they would, wouldn’t they?). Last but not least, James Holmes was reportedly awarded a $26,000 sti - pend by the National Institutes of Health to help cover graduate school ex - penses. Some conspiracy researchers have claimed that Holmes used these funds to purchase all of the necessary equipment for his shooting rampage— an unlikely assertion, but good fodder for the rumor mill just the same (and isn’t that what really counts?). What’s in a Name? (Aurora Edition) L ee Harvey Oswald and Jared Lee Loughner, Sirhan Sirhan, Jack Ruby— sometimes within the names of the alleged perpetrators of infamous crimes (that in many instances turn out to have been the result of active con- spiracies), we find odd similarities, interesting clues and seeming hints. Some- times our intuitions about these things turn out to be nothing after all, and sometimes this line of inquiry leads us places we’d never expect. James Eagan Holmes—nothing sinister-sounding or terribly odd about that name. So why bother dissecting it? Given that we already suspect that Holmes was a patsy, it’s interesting to note that James means “he who sup - plants (takes the place of ).” Eagan as a boy’s name is Irish or Gaelic in origin and means “fire,” and Holmes is a variant of the surname Holme, which is de-"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"312 T—fl Nflffifi 9/11? rived from a name for someone who lived next to a holly tree (from the Middle English holm ). Holmes was either set up to take the fall for the real shooter(s), or was subconsciously coerced into undertaking the task himself. The entire incident has all the hallmarks of the type of occult ritual frequented upon the American public by the Illuminati, whose symbol is the Torch of Illumination (or the Fire of Prometheus, take your pick). The whole thing looks like any number of other media-generated occult affairs/illusions—a Hollywood creation, if you will, with the name “Hollywood” deriving from the traditional use of the wood of a holly tree in the making of magic wands. Holmes was a patsy, set up by the Illuminati, who brought us this dark Hol - lywood production—we already knew that much. Having the patsy’s name spell it out for us and using his signature as an Illuminati signature? That’s a real nice touch. Foreshadowing Black Christmas O n July 27 th , 2012, one week to the day after the Colora - do shooting, a giant inflatable Lord Voldemort did rise quite literally at the Opening Ceremony of the Lon- don Olympics. Considering this fact, the hidden message conveyed by the Colorado shooting, “Born of Aurora, the Dark Knight Rises,” might seem to have a dual meaning. As an occult statement, Lucifer Rises is fairly straightforward; yet, it rais - es the question, When? Are we to understand that Lucifer arose on July 20 th , 2012, or that the Aurora tragedy foreshadowed or foretold the rising of the Inflatable Dark Lord a week later—or both? And what the hell does any of this have to do with Black Christmas? Shooting up a theatre full of innocent civilians is all sport and fun and racks up points with the Big Guy to be certain (as does sending aloft a Super-Sized Blow-Up Beezlebub in front of a global television audience of billions), but neither of these acts is by any means a fitting manner in which to welcome the very presence of the Dark Lord into our world. That requires far more thought and planning, and a far greater sacrifice—along the lines of a nuclear holocaust. So, where’s the connection to Black Christmas?

Two Heads Are Better Than One T he eagle itself has been used from time immemorial to represent such ideas as no - bility and just rulership, and the double-headed eagle is a common symbol in heraldry and vex - illology (the study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags), being most closely associat - ed with the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and Russia."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"316 T—tt NttflTh 9/11? The symbol of the double-headed eagle has been in use for millennia, and has been found in the archaeological remains of both the Sumerian and Hittite civilizations. In Byzantine heraldry, the two heads of the eagle represent the dual sovereignty of the Emperor (secular and religious) and/or the dominance of the Byzantine Emperors over both East and West. In the heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire, the heads represented the Church and the State. Use by Freemasons T he Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash, as it is known within the Craft, is used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Some researchers believe that Masonic use of the double-headed eagle derives from an ear - ly European rite of degrees called the Order of the R oyal Secret, from which the Scottish Rite descended, which used the symbol as a heraldic device, having likely appropriated it from the Roman Empire. Writing in The Chain of Union: Journal of Symbolic and Masonic Studies , Pierre Mollier informs us in his article entitled, “The Double-Headed Eagle: Iconographic Sources of the Masonic Symbol,” that “the double-headed eagle, an image of chivalry and sovereignty belonging to the shared imagery of Western symbolism ... appeared in Masonry in France in the early years of the 1760s with the degree of Knight Kadosh or Grand Inspector Grand Elect (G.I.G.E.).” 1 But this tells us nothing of why they selected the symbol or what it rep - resents to them. Two Heads are Worse than One I t would be easy to understand the eagle’s appeal to the Freemasons as a sign of rulership, particularly in its two-headed form signifying dominance over East and West, church and state. But we must be careful not to confuse the symbol and its exoteric (public, outer) interpretation with its esoteric (inner, secret) interpretation and what it means within the context of Freemasonry.

Birds of a Feather? W e are already familiar with the Egyptian bennu, which was that ancient culture’s representation of the mythical phoenix. Do we find here a sim- ilar substitution of the real for the mythical, of a real bird for a mythical one: have we any contemporary sources of support for draw - ing such a conclusion? To be certain—none other than Manly P. Hall in his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages , tells us that, “The American eagle upon the Great Seal [of the United States] is but a conventionalized phoenix.” The Freemason’s double-headed eagle could in actu- ality then be a double-headed phoenix , and we are well aware of the symbolic significance of its single-headed cousin: as a sign of immortality in the ancient Mystery Schools, as a “sign of the secret orders of the ancient world and of the initiate of those orders” (Hall, The Phoenix ), and as a sign of one “twice- born”—even, to some, as a sign of Lucifer himself (and his followers, those twice-born of hell). Yet, before drawing any firm conclusions, let’s ex - amine additional elements of this symbol. The 33 and the Triangle W riting in The Secret Teachings of All Ages , Manly P. Hall asks the reader to “... consider the number 33. The first temple of Solomon stood for thirty-three years in its pristine splendor... Also King David ruled for thirty-three years in Jerusalem; the Masonic Order is divided into thirty-three symbolic degrees; there are thirty-three segments in the human spinal column; and Jesus was crucified in the thirty-third year of His life.” (There were also 33 passengers on Flight 93...which departed from Gate A17.) The number 33 having tremendous occult significance and the highest de- gree of Freemasonry being the 33 rd , we find the number emblazoned upon the emblem of that degree. Not only that, but we also find it contained within a triangle, representative of the pyramid, which, if you’ll remember from Most Dangerous , may be considered as the ultimate symbol of the Mysteries, and as a symbol of illumination."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"318 T—tt NttflTh 9/11? Deus Meumque Jus A bove the bird’s two heads we observe a crown, and in its claws, a sword, which would seem to have the ob - vious connotations of sovereignty and rule-by-force. We also find a banner bearing the phrase, Deus Meumque Jus , which is generally translated as, “God and my right” or, less frequently, as “God and my moral rightness.” Freemasons would assert that this refers to their right to worship and re- spect God in any manner they so choose, as well as to their duty to defend and respect the religious beliefs of others. Yet, might an alternative interpretation be, My rights are granted by my god ; or, much more sinisterly, My rights are granted by my god, Lucifer, who gives me license to do whatever I wish ? This would certainly be in keeping with the dis - torted concept of liberty we encountered in Most Dangerous : not “liberty and justice for all,” but rather the liberty to do as we damn well please—freedom from God, granted by the light-bearer who frees us from the unnatural con- straints of artificial morality. “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.” There Will Be Blood A double-headed phoenix, the number 33 ...

As time rolled on, it passed from the Sumerians to the men of Akhad, from the men of Akhad to the Hittites, from the denizens of Asia Minor to the Seljukian Sultans, from whom it was brought by Crusaders to the Emperors of the East and West, whose successors to-day are the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs, as well as to the Masonic “Emperors of the East and West,” whose successors to-day are the Supreme Councils, 33°, that have inherited the insignia of the Rite of Perfection. 2 Others, including the illustrious Albert Pike, held the view that the origins of the two-headed bird ultimately derived from the arcane symbol - ism of alchemy, which portrays a wide variety of two-headed beings often symbolizing the union of opposites. (One might also think of the symbol as representing two-birds-in-one, such as the Shen- Shen and the Rech from Chapter 12, but I just sor - ta made that up so you shouldn’t put a lot of stock in that interpretation.) The double-headed eagle as an alchemical symbol illustrates the hermetic and alchemical axiom SOLVE et COAGULA,” writes 32° Masonic author Gregory H. Peters in “ Solve et Coagula : Alchemical Symbolism of the Dou - ble-Headed Eagle,” which is, “the process of separating the elements and the n bringing them together after purification and consecration. 3 Peters continues, highlighting the ultimate aim of alchemy, the transmutation of man: “The double headed-eagle, as the ensign of the Alchemical Rebus or Stone of the Philosophers, symbolizes this process, the magnum opus or Great Work of spiritual regeneration. Through its unification of opposites and association with al - chemical Fire, the path of regeneration and ascent up the Tree of Life is indicated.” The double-headed black eagle, to be precise, was indeed a principal motif in early alchemical literature, at times being equated with the Philosopher’s Stone and thus properly viewed as a symbol of the Great Work itself—and the two-headed bird of the Freemasons is, in fact, a double-headed black eagle,"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"320 T—tt NttflTh 9/11? not a double-headed phoenix, despite Dan Brown’s repeated assertions in The Lost Symbol , in which he references the double-headed phoenix as the emblem of the highest degree of Freemasonry a reported 13 times.

This is the demonic transmutation of the species through fear, terror, torment and torture, the establishment of a mechanistic Ahri - manic paradise. Theirs is a supernaturally-informed scientific system of oppression that could actually be viewed as an advanced form of witchcraft, rooted in alche- my and magic, designed for a single unified purpose: full-spectrum dom- inance, total control of humanity’s physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual selves. Thy Will Be Done A ccording to the age-old plan of the Illuminati, God shall be diminished and Lucifer exalted in the minds of man, which is only fitting from their perspective, as the Bible is a fiction, and in truth, Lucifer is God. It is they who are the true light-workers, setting mankind free from the tyranny of the mind Christianity has held them under for 2,000 years. They offer us a new take on the hermetic wisdom, As Above, So Below. Their interpretation is more readily understood by reversing, as is their practice, this sacred formulation, yielding: As Below, So Above—as in hell, so on earth . Thy will be done, on earth, as it is in hell. The Mascot of Black Christmas T he emblem of the 33 rd degree of Freemasonry was ingeniously employed by the Illuminati, hiding behind a veil of tradition and secrecy, as an in- plain-sight signature of authorship, an in-your-face claim of responsibility for the heinous crimes of Black Christmas. To them, the Double-Headed Black Eagle of Lagash—as it represents a monstrous two-faced, ill-tempered, self-immolating, self-resurrecting rapa - cious beast of prey—is truly a fitting symbol for Lucifer, the Light-bearer, re- born, newly ascendant after having been unjustly cast down from heaven in the days of old. The Black Phoenix, if you will, was the mascot of Black Christmas, a cel- ebration of the Dawning of the Age of Lucifer, involving a mass sacrifice by fir e—and not just any old fire, but rather the fire of creation, the fire at the heart of all matter, the fire at the heart of the sun, nuclear fire.

Universal Motion, the Great Secret and the Royal Secret I n regard to the “Sublime Mysteries of the Illuminati’s Double-headed Eagle,” Texe Marrs wrote that “Illuminists refer to the ‘Universal Motion’ of forces that will annihilate the world as we know it, giving rise to the New Age New Order led by Satan and his Illuminati chiefs.” The long-held “Great Secret” of the illumined ones is, in fact, that the God of the Mysteries, the God of cunning, lies and deceit, the two-faced deity, is Lucifer in disguise; and the exalted “Royal Secret,” the Illuminati’s core doc- trine, their cardinal teaching, is that out of bloody, universal chaos will ulti - mately arise equilibrium and the Holy Empire of the Illuminati, to be ruled by the cabalistic Messiah, the Anti-Christ. 4 Have we not, God help us, witnessed the fulfillment of these things in our time?

Now We Are All Sons of Bitches J . Robert Oppenheimer, often called the “father of the atomic bomb” for his key role in the Manhattan Project, recalled that while watching the first test of a nuclear weapon at the Trinity site in New Mexico, he was reminded of a line from the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture: Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds. After witnessing the incredible explosion, test director Kenneth Bainbridge turned to Op - penheimer and established a legendary saying of his own, commenting, “Now we are all sons of bitches,” which Oppenheimer later stated was the best thing anyone said immediately fol- lowing the test. “Trinity” was the project code name for the first detonation of a nuclear device, and al- though the exact origin of the name is somewhat unclear, it is often attributed to Robert Op - penheimer as a reference to the poetry of John Donne. In 1962, in his response to a letter inquiring about the matter, Oppenheimer wrote, Why I chose the name is not clear, but I know what thoughts were in my mind. There is a poem of John Donne, written just before his death, which I know and love. From it a quotation: “As West and East / In all flatt Maps—and I am one—are one, / So death doth touch the Resurrection.” That still does not make a Trinity, but in another, better known devotional poem Donne opens, “Batter my heart, three person’d God.” Now, you can take the man at his word if you want to (I personally can’t make a whole lot of sense out of his comment), but it is certainly worth noting that it was Oppenheimer himself who recorded for posterity his thoughts at the moment of the explosion itself: “Now I am be - come Death, the destroyer of worlds.” This fact is of more than mere passing interest, con- sidering that the third person of the Hindu “Great Trinity” is Śhiva the destroyer, whose symbol, like Satan, is the trident, a fire symbol. Remember, too, from Most Dangerous , that “The illustration for The Tower [tarot card] in Aleister Crow- ley’s Book of Thoth shows the eye of Shiva opening at the top: reality is the dream of Shiva, and when he awakens, all is destroyed.” C ould the Father of the Atomic Bomb truly not re - member where he got the inspiration for the project name, or perhaps he just thought it better to keep it to himself. Might Oppenheimer have been drawing on the same source of inspiration as the planners of other “major proj- ects”: Dealey Plaza is less than 3,000 feet from the Trinity River; Trinity Church (on Trinity Place) in downtown Man- hattan is less than 1,000 feet from where the Twin Towers stood; and, wouldn’t ya know, the Trinity Cathedral at 100 W. Roosevelt Street in downtown Phoenix was well within the blast radius (although it was not completely destroyed and, again, as with 44 Monroe, its hulking shell was fre - quently used by the media as a visual reference point in the now-unrecognizable cityscape). In the end, after all the mockery, all the pain and suf- fering, all the occult devices and rituals, all the carnage, perhaps Trinity test director Kenneth Bainbridge’s immortal words are in fact the best that we can hope for in describing our own situation: Now we are all sons of bitches.

Chapter Twenty-Three Prescott, Geronimo and Skull & Bones L ess than 100 miles north of Phoenix lies Prescott, Arizona, named in honor of prominent 19 th century historian William Hickling Prescott. In 1869, James G. Sheldon, a settler from Maine, was killed by Apaches at Camp Willow Grove, located west of the town of Prescott. During World War I, six young men from Yale University were serv - ing as Army volunteers at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which is home to the Apache Indian Prisoner of War Cem- etery. During their time there, it is alleged that they stole the skull, and at least one bone (along with a few other items) of famed Apache war - rior Geronimo. Remembered as one of the last Native American leaders to hold out against the US government, Geronimo evaded capture for years and eventually surrendered in Skele- ton Canyon, Arizona, in 1886. These six men were all members of the Yale secret society Skull & Bones, among them a purported distant relative of William Prescott himself: his name, Prescott Sheldon Bush, who later became a U.S. Senator and was the father of President George H.W. Bush and the grandfather of President George W. Bush, both Bonesmen themselves. While it is not known whether Prescott Sheldon Bush was also a distant relative of James Sheldon (after whom a major street in Prescott was named), avenging his death decades after the fact, what is known is that Geronimo’s"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"330 TttTh NThft— 9/11? great-grandson, Harlyn Geronimo of Mescalero, New Mexico, appealed to Prescott Bush’s grandson, George W., while he was President, requesting his help in securing the return of his relative’s remains. Speaking to a reporter cov - ering the story, Mr. Geronimo said, I am requesting his help in getting the remains—the skull and the fe- mur—returned, if they were taken. According to our traditions the re- mains of this sort, especially in this state when the grave was desecrated ... need to be reburied with the proper rituals. To return the dignity and let his spirits rest in peace ... is important in our tradition. Sorry, Harlyn, but Skull & Bones reportedly has a tradition of its own, and it involves kissing a skull, referred to as “Geronimo.” True or False I n 2009, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of individ - uals claiming to be Geronimo’s descendants— against, among others, Barack Obama, Robert Gates and Skull & Bones—requesting the return of Geronimo’s remains, al - though the plaintiffs’ attorney acknowl - edged that he had no hard proof that the story of their theft was even true. Various investigators have rejected the story as false, and a Fort Sill spokesman stated, “There is no evidence to indicate that the bones are anywhere but in the grave site.” The chairman of the Fort Sill Apache tribe of Oklahoma also calls the story a hoax. However, in 1986, a former chairman of the San Carlos Apache had re- ceived an anonymous letter with a photograph and copy of a ledger claiming that Skull & Bones was indeed in possession of the remains. The Bonesmen’s attorney denied the claim and said the ledger was a hoax, and then, quite oddly, offered to return what appeared to be the skull of a child, which was refused. Then, in 2006, a letter written in 1918 by a Skull & Bones member was discovered which appeared to openly claim credit for the theft: The skull of the worthy Geronimo the Terrible, exhumed from its tomb at Fort Sill by your club... is now safe inside the [society’s] tomb and bone together with his well worn femurs, bit and saddle horn."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"331 PttThft—fiff, GThttfiflffi\u0017fi \u0016fl\u0015 S\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0012 & BfiflThft An Outrageous Insult R egardless of whether Skull & Bones has Geronimo’s remains or not, in 2011 the U.S. military decided that “Geronimo” would be a fitting code- name for the raid to capture yet another highly-elusive fugitive from American justice, Osama bin Laden (some reports stated that the name referred to the overall operation; others, to bin Laden himself; and, yet others, to the act of killing or capturing the terrorist leader). Many Native Americans understandably objected to the selection of the name for the operation, with the president of one advocacy group observing, “It’s how deeply embedded the ‘Indian as enemy’ is in the collective mind of America,” and Harlyn Geronimo telling the Senate Commission on Indian Af - fairs that it was an “outrageous insult.” The End of the bin Laden Fairy Tale W hat no one realized was that “Operation Geronimo” was designed as an “outrageous insult” to all of us , and represented the closing of one of the main chapters in the whole 9/11 work of fiction, that of Osama bin Lad - en as the Islamic-radical boogeyman (CIA-trained, nonetheless, with family connections to the Bushes), whom the combined decade-long efforts of the largest and most-sophisticated intelligence services in the world had somehow failed to locate. The partially-botched raid had all the tell-tale signs of being yet another made-for-reality-TV production, complete with continually-changing details and lies within lies (as well as related follow-up drama), from bin Laden being buried at sea “according to Muslim tradition,” which it’s sure the hell not, to Secretary of State Hilary Clinton claiming to be covering her mouth as she sneezed in a photo taken in one of the White House’s situation rooms, when it was obvious she was somewhat aghast at something she was viewing."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"332 TttTh NThft— 9/11? Whether bin Laden was actually killed during the raid, or, as some conspiracy theorists assert, has been dead for years, the only thing that you can be sure of is that nothing was what it seemed to be, and you’ll never know the real truth. And if you start flapping your gums about it, you might end up like some of the mem- bers of Seal Team 6 that con- ducted the raid, who paid the price for their team members running their mouths about the inconsistencies in the official story, and found themselves— against normal operating procedure—on board an Army National Guard helicopter in Afghanistan, sent out on a mission (first it was fire-support for pinned-down soldiers, then it was search-and-destroy) during which their air - craft was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing all aboard. So, keep your mouth shut, and remember: Operation Geronimo was just the end of one chapter in a fairy tale that doesn’t end happily-ever-after, and those who brought us the production don’t give a shit about offending Native Americans or anyone else. “Geronimo,” the idea of using the name of one slippery character to refer to another—that’s just window dressing. The real purpose in the selection of that name, if you hadn’t figured it out by now, was as yet another tip-of-the-hat to Skull & Bones and the Bush Family Crime Syndicate. I Should Have Never Surrendered I n February 1909, Geronimo was thrown from his horse while riding home, and lay in the cold all night before being found the next day. He contracted pneumonia as a result, and while on his deathbed, expressed regret to his neph- ew over his decision to surrender to U.S. forces years earlier. His last words were reported to be, “I should have never surrendered. I should have fought until I was the last man alive.” So should we, by god, so should we. Not Worth Counting D espite their cultural differences, one has to think that hard-core anti-illegal immigration cham- pions Governor Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio would have gotten along fairly well with Geronimo, at least on this particular issue. Geronimo had his own problems with our south-of-the-border neigh- bors, and wrote in his 1905 autobiography (which you get the impression he may have titled himself ), Geronimo, My Life: the Autobiography of Geronimo , I have killed many Mexicans; I do not know how many, for frequently I did not count them. Some of them were not worth counting. It has been a long time since then, but still I have no love for the Mexicans. With me they were always treacherous and malicious.

There are thirteen coils in a true hangman’s noose and thirteen witches in a coven, sometimes referred to as a “Devil’s dozen”—12 witches plus Satan. There are 13 stripes on the U.S. flag, and there were of course 13 original colonies. In the Great Seal of the United States, both sides of which are reproduced on the reverse of the one-dollar bill, there are: 13 steps in the unfinished pyramid, 13 letters in “ E Pluribus Unum ,” 13 stars above the eagle, 13 bars on the shield, 13 leaves on the olive branch (as well as 13 olives), and 13 arrows.

When de Molay later retracted his confession, Philip had him slowly burned upon a scaffold on an island in the River Seine in Paris. Philip then used the previously-forced confessions to sentence 54 Templars to be burnt at the stake. In Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry by John J. Robinson, it is proposed that the Templars, who had been officially abolished by papal decree, subsequently went underground among masons in England and later devel - oped into the Freemasons; regardless of whether this is true, the story of de Molay’s defiance of his captors has been well-incorporated into Masonic lore.

Vari - ous explanations were offered for this new sign, but the truth of the matter is that Ophiucus has been a recognized constellation for centuries. It’s been right there all along, between (and slightly above) Sagittarius and Scorpio, the guardians of Galactic Center. Now that fact alone should make your ears perk up, as we’ve just finished (well, not quite) dissecting the inner workings of a Galactic MegaRitual cen- tered upon the Womb of Creation, or Skull Hill, or whatever you want to call it.

In traditional astro - logical iconography, Ophiucus appears to carry the great serpent, but, tech- nically, Serpens is a completely separate constellation said to run behind the great healer (thus Serpens is the only split or two-part figure in the heavens).

B orn Albert Nelson on a cotton plantation in Indianola (some say Ab - erdeen), Mississippi, blues legend Albert King occasionally referred to himself as “B.B. King’s half-brother,” although they were unrelated. The iconic blues tune “Born Under a Bad Sign” was originally recorded by Albert King as the title track for an album of the same name released in 1967, and it be - came one of the most popular and influential blues albums of the late ‘60s. Bands or performers who subsequently recorded covers of the song include the British rock group Cream and rock legend Jimi Hen- drix, who, if you’ll remember from book one, starred in the 1972 New Age hippie film, Rain- bow Bridge —also the name of Hendrix’s posthu- mously-released fifth album. Known as one of the “Three Kings of the Blues Guitar” (along with B.B. King and Freddie King), 250-pound Albert stood an intimidating 6-foot 4-inches tall and was known as “The Velvet Bulldozer.” The “velvet” part of his nickname arose from his smooth voice and laid-back singing style; the “bulldozer” part from a time early in King’s career when he worked as a bull- dozer operator during the day before hitting the stage at night. King shuffled of his mortal coil on December 21st, 1992, and although I don’t even think we’re even remotely off into the realm of conspiracy or synchronicity here, then again, perhaps that assessment is a failure of imag- ination on my part.

The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius? D etermining when one “New Age” ( not New Great Age) ends and another begins depends on establishing in what time frame earth’s axis could be said to cease pointing at one constellation and start pointing at another. If this strikes you as being fraught with all sorts of difficulties and room for disagree- ment, you couldn’t be more correct. Astrology is not an exact art by any stretch of the imagination, and there is little consensus within the astrological community about the beginnings and endings of ages. Although the “Age of Aquarius” is typically used to refer to the heyday of the hippie and New Age movements of the 1960s and 1970s, as the opening song from the 1967 musical Hair tells us, “This is the dawning of the Age of Aquari - us”—the full manifestation of the Age will not oc - cur until sometime in the future. Actually, though, there’s not even agreement on this point. Writing in The Book of World Horo- scopes , Nicholas Campion shares that he has col - lected over 90 dates provided by researchers for the start of the Age of Aquarius, with a range of over 2,000 years and beginning in the 15 th century: from 1447 to 3621. All this is a moot point, anyway, because the globalist Luciferians weren’t laying claim to one puny little age, they were playing for all the marbles, estab- lishing the New Great Age from its birth as their own—claiming the entire new Cycle of Precession as belonging to their god.

W riting in the New York Observer in April of 2001 in an article entitled “At Skull and Bones, Bush’s Secret Club Initiates Ream Gore,” Ron Rosenbaum (the self-described Ahab of Skull & Bones) recounted his successful attempt to surveil the secret society’s initiation ritual. Rosenbaum and several accomplices—using three night-vision-capable digital-video cameras, on tape recorder, a stepladder and two walkie-talkies—managed to record the occult pyscho-drama, which included “Patriarchs,” or Bonesmen, playing the parts of various characters, including the Devil and Presi- dent George W. Bush (to clarify, two separate characters). As Rosenbaum recounts, the dialogue was most interesting: Then someone—one of the initiates?—called out “Uncle Toby!” (Many Bone ritual personae are taken from Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy —you gotta give them credit there for good taste.) “Uncle Toby!” the cry repeated. “Shut up, neophyte.” “Take that plunger out of my ass, Uncle Toby.” Presumably, this mocking [Abner] Louima reference was a ploy to scare initiates into think - ing Uncle Toby was going to give them the plunger treatment. That cheerful rectal theme was followed up by: “I’m gonna ream you like I reamed Al Gore!” from the George W. imitator. Followed by “Help me! It’s the devil!” And then “George W.” really getting into it: “I’m gonna kill you like I killed Al Gore.” Silence. Then a door opened. Voices—half of them, it seemed, women—were screaming: “Run! Neophyte! Run, neophyte!” (The neophytes are, of course, the new initiates.) From my post, I could only see hooded figures racing about in the darkness above my head, accompanied by cries of: “Run, neophyte!” “Find the femur!” And (again): “Take that plunger out of my ass, Uncle Toby!” Then silence for awhile. The neophyte seemed to have gone back inside the Tomb. After which one of the Patriarchs complained, “We ought to get better blood than this fuckin’ syrup, man.” It was only later that I learned what the blood was for: the whole throat-slitting “barbarian” tableau after the skull-kissing. But first there was a different kind of kissing being referred to. There were cries of “Lick my bumhole, neophyte!” “Lick my ass, neophyte!” “Do you like my bum, neophyte?” (Despite these heartfelt pleas, we did not witness any of those acts being consummated.) The bumhole tribute was followed by more cries of “Get the femur!” and at least part of the death mantra I’d heard before: “DEATH EQUALS DEATH.” Following which, “George W.” chimed in with “I’m the President of the motha-fuckin’ U.S.A.”—apparently just for the sheer pleasure of saying it. (He was sounding more like the real George W. all the time.) It began to be clear that what was going on outside in the courtyard was the climax of an initiation ceremony that began inside the Tomb. There, it’s reputed, the initiates must first enter into a coffin and “die to the barbarian world,” to the world of “savages” (all but the Skull and Bones elect), in order to be reborn as a member of “The Order.” Then comes the skull-kissing and the throat-slashing. ...

We’ll stop just long enough to note that the fourth of four separate attacks that day took place aboard a dou- ble-decker bus in Tavistock Square, which was a tip-of-the- hat to the Tavistock Institute, an organization up to its ears in mind-control projects in both the UK and US and a pio - neer in the field. (Also, I would be remiss if I didn’t at least mention in passing that the third bombing took place near Russell Square, opposite the British Medical Association, which is headquartered in a building originally constructed for Madame Helena Blavatsky’s House of Theosophy.) Although there are many similarities between 9/11 and 7/7, the key shared ingredient is one we’re all-too-fa - miliar with: mockery. And, lest you doubt it, a picture is worth a thousand words...actually, the picture is of words, so I’m not sure how you figure that, but in any case, all you really need to know about 7/7 can be seen in these photos of the attack at Tavistock Square. “Outright terror, bold and brilliant” ...my god, you’ve just got to love that British sense of humor, don’t you?"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"340 T—tt NttfiTh 9/11? And, with that brief stop, we’re off to the London 2012 Olympics, which, by the way, were awarded to the city by the International Olympic Committee on... July 6 th , 2005. Those Brits sure know how to celebrate a win. Too Obvious W e’re only going to stay a few minutes at the Olympics, too, primarily because it was such a blatantly obvious Illuminati affair that it presents a relatively minor challenge compared to all the muck we’ve already waded through ... that, and I suppose I’m a little biased in believing that we Yanks do put on a much better MegaRitual. We’ve already explored the origin of the XXX in the 30 th Olympiad in Chapter 13, so there’s no need to repeat that here. We’ve also noted that the rationale—or at least part of it—behind the lack of a terror spectacular at the Games: they didn’t want to spoil the surprise of Black Christmas, didn’t want to preempt the The Big Show. In addition to that, there’s the obvious fact that many of them were in atten- dance in London, as it was, after all, designed as an Illuminati MegaSpectacle, with some of the most awe-inspiring and in-your-face monumental symbols of Illumination of the 21 st century. Spooks: Code 9 A nother reason for the lack of an attack during the London Olympics was that it was just too obvious a target—what’s the use in killing a bunch of people if the world is expecting it? Really, where’s the fun in that? That’s not to say, however, that the Illuminati didn’t derive great satisfac - tion from gaming the public for years in advance on the likelihood, nay, the practical certainty, of a nuclear terrorist strike during the Games of the 30 th Olympiad. Hell, the Brits even made a TV series in 2008 centered upon the idea, Spooks: Code 9 , which ran on BBC and was set in 2012 just after a nuclear attack during the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics.

One of the best featured main-stream-media reports concerning sizable quantities of radioactively contaminated soil stored in a containment unit 250 meters from the north end of the Olympic Stadium. The area reportedly used to be an industrial dump site, as well as home to a small nuclear reactor used for research purposes, and officials allegedly chose not to remove the radioac - tive material because of concerns about transporting it through such heavily populated areas. Another of the best stories served up for conspiracy theorists concerned the existence of, no shit, unexploded Nazi ordnance on the property; some ex - perts said the bombs might actually be located underneath the stadium itself. Radiological material, conventional explosives—last time I checked, those were the two key ingredients of a “dirty bomb,” both already on-site and in close proximity to one another. Even without the Nazi bombs, there were plenty of explosives around, with a warship sitting in the Thames River and anti-missile batteries all around, part of the most sophisticated, all-encompass - ing, comprehensive security shield ever erected. In truth, there was no way in hell that any terrorist organization could have gotten a dirty bomb, or even a container of expired yogurt, through the mas - sive security ring; but it was made to look for all the world like a false-flag -ter- rorist strike was imminent. Glorious Symbolism T he true glory of the XXX Olympics lay not in the pomp and circumstance of the opening ceremony—the opening music for which was scripted by the group Underworld —but rather in the magnificent (unparalleled, really) display of Illuminati symbols in and around Olympic Stadium, and elsewhere. From the world’s largest congregation of all-seeing-eyes (incorporated into the construction of the stadium and incarnated as the two All-Seeing-Eye mas - cots) to the world’s largest torch of Illumination, it was truly a sight to behold."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"342 T—tt NttfiTh 9/11?"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"343 T—tt 2012 LfiThfffiTh Iftftffifl\u0017Th\u0016\u0015\u0017 Mtt\u0014\u0016\u0013\u0012tt\u0011\u0015\u0016\u0011fttt Ah, yes, children as a living Torch of Illumination.

We’re Marching to Zion S everal years before the London Olympics, one bright young chap named Rik Clay happened to notice that the hideous official logo (pictured below, left)—which seemed to defy all standards of aesthetic acceptability—spelled out, when properly rearranged, the word “Zion.” Rik wasn’t the only person to take notice: in February 2011, Iran submit - ted a formal complaint to the IOC and threatened to boycott the Olympics, describing the logo as “racist” and asking both that it be withdrawn and that the logo designers be confronted. The IOC quietly rejected the demands; Iran eventually announced that it would not boycott the games. The question of whether or not there was any substance to the allegation that this was an intentional aspect of the logo design was never actually an- swered. Had the London Olympics somehow been intended to facilitate the creation of an earthly Zion, or the arrival of the “New Jerusalem” from the Book of Revelation? Those in favor of such theories cited William Blake’s short poem (print - ed c. 1808) “And did those feet in ancient time,” from the preface to his epic poem, Milton , one of a collection of writings known as the Prophetic Books. Blake’s poem was inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accom- panied by his uncle Joseph of Arimathea, travelled to what is now England during Christ’s so-called “lost years,” and reads: And did those feet in ancient time, Walk upon England’s mountains green: And was the holy Lamb of God, On England’s pleasant pastures seen!

We re there powerful hidden interests whose agenda this poem reflected and for whom these verses served as a source of inspiration? Well, the famous hymn based upon the poem, called “Jerusalem,” has been featured in many television programs and movies, including Monty Python’s Flying Circus . Perhaps more to the point, however, freelance journalist David Hambling, writing in the Fortean Times , informs us in his article, “City of Symbols,” that To the builders of the new London, the city was to be the New Jerusa - lem. Rome was in the hands of Catholics, so London must succeed it as the capital of the true faith. This was reinforced by a popular theory that the English were the descendants of the Lost Tribe of Israel, who disap - peared into the West after the destruction of the kingdom in 722 BC. Londoner William Blake—who had a tendency to employ Masonic im- agery—was merely echoing this idea when he wrote of Jerusalem being “builded here” decades later. This belief was a help to those who believed that Britain should be a global empire, a true successor to Rome, with a temporal and religious capital to match it. 1 The London 2012 XXX Olympics as a Church-of-England conspiracy then? Not so much. As an Illuminati MegaSpectacle? To be sure. But was the logo in fact intended to spell “Zion,” just for kicks or otherwise? Who the hell cares, because look what else it spells just as convincingly: That’s right— Ozzy ! The British “Prince of Darkness,” the Wizard of Ozz, the embodiment of the True Spirit of the XXX Olympiad. Incidentally, speak - ing of August 12 th , the closing date of the 2012 Games, was the same day that the Wizard of Oz premiered way back in 1939.

In Closing T he closing ceremony of the 17-day-long London Olympics, and what do we find but a 20m-wide illuminated, flaming phoe- nix, rising atop the Olympic flame which has been fanned out into a dome representing the creature’s burning nest—with the British pop band Take That singing “Rule the World,” in which the lyrics “we can rule the world” are repeated six times. But it gets better still. This was the 30th Olympiad, the XXX Olympics, the Olympics of the Triple Cross, the significance of which has been thoroughly explained. The message is that the phoenix rises at the time of the triple crossing—and the phoenix at the closing ceremony rises before a stage laid out in the shape of the Union Jack, a triple cross. (The current design of the flag of the United Kingdom dates from the union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. The flag consists of: #1, the red cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, edged in white and superimposed on #2, the Cross of St Patrick, pa - tron saint of Ireland, which are superimposed on #3, the Saltire of Saint Andrew, patron saint of Scotland. Three crosses, aligned.) The stage floor itself is covered in oversized newsprint with headlines pulled from British literature. As one observer noted, “Oddly morbid, if not inappropriate choices” included the following: “To die will be an awfully big adventure” ( Peter Pan ); “This is the way world ends” (T.S. Eliot, The Hollow Men ); and “The rest is silence.” This last line consists of the final words spoken by Shakespeare’s Hamlet just before he expires. In Shakespeare’s day, belief in an afterlife was near uni - versal, and the reality of Heaven, and Hell, was accepted unquestioningly. But Hamlet, a child of the philosophical Renaissance, seems to question the cer - tainty of Heaven with his final line. Hamlet speaks of death throughout the play, in one scene staring into the eyes of a freshly-unearthed skull in search of meaning. As he lays dying, he utters the words, “the rest is silence,” in which context the word “rest” could have a dual meaning: it could be read as “the remainder is silence”, he dies and will speak no more; or, “rest” could refer to eternal rest, the sleep of death. “For in that sleep of death,” Hamlet asks himself earlier in the play, “what dreams may come?” As he slips into death, does he find the answer to his question? What dreams may come? None, the rest is silence. There is no Heaven, just the silence of the grave. Death equals death ."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The Next 9/11? Chapter Twenty-Six The Illuminati End-of-Days Code T he precise time for the winter solstice in 2012, as listed on the U.S. Naval Observatory’s website for years in advance, was 11:11 Univer - sal Time. Given that 2012 was the year of “Galactic Alignment,” New Agers and spiritualists went absolutely bonkers over this seeming super-syn- chronistic Message from the Matrix. The exact moment of the 2012 winter solstice, and thus Galactic Align- ment itself, they believed, was 11:11— the Universe was speaking to us . Entire books were written on the subject and there were more 11:11 YouTube videos than you could shake a stick at. Nobody stopped to consider the alternative explanation: that, as opposed to being a loving message from the Creator indicating the impending ascen- sion of mankind, this was yet another indicator of the exact depth of the tyr - anny humanity was now living under—a tyranny so pervasive that it extended into every aspect of our lives, of our existence, including time itself. Zero Hour W inter solstice: December 21 st . 12/21. 11:11. If that looks strangely like a code to you, you’re instincts are correct, and if you remember 11 from Most Dan - gerous as “the number of magick in itself,” you’re starting to put the pieces together. 2012, the year of the Triple Cross, the year of the Great Wedding (Heav - en/MWG meets Earth/horizon).

Do you not think that, being the insane control freaks they have repeatedly shown themselves to be, the Illuminati had some ingenious scheme for count - ing up (or counting down) to this most momentous of occasions—of defining time itself, according to their own designs?"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"348 TTh— N—ttfi 9/11? The Math Structure of the Order of the Ages T o what, exactly, am I referring? This—11:11 UT December 21 st , 2012, was not simply a time and date. It was a code , one that reflected the very mathematical structure of the order of the ages: 11:11, 12/21 11 x 111 = 1221 Intriguing , you might be thinking, but what does that really tell us? For one thing, it hints at an ability to manipulate our reality that defies what most of us are willing to accept. But only hints , because that’s not the full code, not by a long shot. You’ll recall that the Cycle of Precession is approximated at 26,000 years by as - tronomers—that’s just not good enough for the Global Controllers. Their mastery of our r eality is total, and their knowledge of its secret inner workings complete (at least by their own estimation): some would call it magic, some would call it super-knowledge...others would call it occult bullshit, but I’d say we’d better pay close attention to what the folks calling the shots actually believe. The Mayan long-count calendar, consists of 13 baktun (there’s our thirteen again), a baktun being comprised of 144,000 days. December 21 st , 2012, corresponded to the end of 13 baktun, to the end of a period of 1,872,000 days. The Mayans maintained a complex set of interlocking calendars, tracking sets of 260, 360 and 365 days. Dividing 1,872,000 by 360 yields 5,200, and in the Western tradition, a 360-day year is known as a “prophetic year” (p.y.). The Mayans divided the Great Age into five sub-ages, versus the traditional twelve (thirteen, whatever), each consisting of 13 baktun. So, each Mayan age equaled 5,200 p.y., and the Great Age equaled exactly 26,000 p.y.; a Great Age that is 26,000 p.y. in length contains exactly 9,360,000 days. Now, t h a t ’s the kind of precision occultist control-freaks can dig, baby; yet, nev - er satisfied with the status quo, they desired a time-keeping system all their own, one jus t as perfect, or, better still, more perfect. And their wishes were fulfilled. Mathematical Shorthand for the Apocalypse A s a side enterprise, the Illuminati took great pleasure in devising “mathematical shorthand” for the End of the Age (not that it had any practical use whatsoever): •\t The number of prophetic years in the Great Age: 26,000= 360 x 72.2 r epeating •\t The number of days in the Great Age: 9,360,000 = 360 2 x 72.2 repeating Fascinating —pointless, but fascinating, yet again I say, it’s damn hard to argue with mathematical perfection."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"349 TTh— Ittttfiflftff\u0018\u0017ft Eff\u0016-\u0015\u0014-D\u0018\u0013\u0012 C\u0015\u0016— The Illuminati SuperNumber B ringing the beginnings of our date code forward, we commence the op - eration: 11 x 111 = 1221 1221 x 21 = 25641 25641 = 777 x 33 = 77 x 333 Now, anybody that knows numerology or Crowleyian gematria will im- mediately recognize the significance of the 333 (the number of the demon Choronzon) and the 777 (often viewed as the number of God, too much other stuff to even go into), and we of course recognize at least the superficial impor - tance of the 33 and 77 from our own investigations. Yes, but again, what does this tell us? 25641 is the Illuminati SuperNum- ber: a mathematical alchemical formulation capable of transmuting its very nature, much like the mythical phoenix. It is 777 and 33, the number of God and the number of Christ, and si - multaneously 77 and 333, the number of Satan and the number of Choronzon. Or, would you rather invoke the Biblical anti-Christ, whose number is listed in the Book of Revelation as 666? 25+641 = 666. But wait, some Bibli - cal manuscripts list the number of the Beast as 616. That’s okay: 641-25 = 616. 25641 mathematically represents the synthesis of all things, the reconciliation of opposites. It speaks of Unification, of Union. That’s not all, however. Recall that the number of days in the Great Age is 9,360,000, and divide this by 25641: the result, 365.04036. The Illuminati SuperNumber is also the number of 365- day years in the Great Age. (Yes, I know that the length of a year is currently 365.242 days—we have no way of knowing what the actual average length of a day is over the last twenty-five thousand plus years, and, besides, it’s damn hard to argue with the mathematical perfection above.) To fully comprehend this, let’s examine further: 11 x 111 = 1221 x 21 = 25641 A total of 25641 “Illuminati years,” broken down into 21 sets of 1221, the final set of which came to an close on 12/21 at exactly 11:11 UT—the literal End of Days (9,360,000 days, to be precise). Now that is mathematical genius, and, I dare say, real magick."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"350 TTh— N—ttfi 9/11? PostScript: Revelation L est you leave with the false impression that the Illuminati date code was based upon Mayan calendrical wisdom alone, I will briefly point out that there are tremendous similarities between the astrotheological teachings of that South American civilization and those of certain ancient Hebrew priests and writers, in particular the author(s) of the Book of Revelation. Although the authorship of the book is traditionally attributed to John, who wrote it is not nearly as important as what it contains —which is something far different than what most Christians and Biblical scholars conceive of. In Chapter 21, Revelation describes the New Jerusalem, the purported City of God, in considerable detail. These details include a variety of items, in- cluding 12 gemstones, which are in fact the gemstones associated with the 12 signs of the Zodiac. Revelation is replete with zodiacal symbolism, and what we find in the twenty-first chapter is an encoded calendar very similar in cer - tain respects to the Mayan long-count calendar. Hebrew writers sometimes used distance as a metaphor for time, and without getting into all of the measurements and the math, this is precisely the case in this instance. These ancient keepers of wisdom utilized a geometric construct as a means of encoding specific numerical information concerning the passage of time, lots of time.

And if you have read this book, I’m sure your head is already aching, and a full recap wouldn’t do anything but make it worse—so I’ll mercifully keep this as short as possible. Like federal officials riding high above the carnage follow - ing a major nuclear attack, we’re just going to skim over the surface, picking out the major details in the landscape... reminding ourselves where we’ve been and what we’ve seen (just when you thought you might be able to forget it). ‘Twas the Night before Black Christmas... W e started out in Paradise Valley, in the Valley of the Sun, where we wit - nessed the birth of a second sun, a nuclear-fueled conflagration that was at the very heart of the 2012 Black Christmas XXX Galactic MegaRitual, and the New Ground Zero. We found yet another monumentally-insulting memo - rial to match the one in Shanksville, PA, and were paid a visit by our old friend 17, who, like a bad rash, seemed to be everywhere. We then witnessed the Re- turn of the Trident and visited with Sparky the Sun Devil in “The House of Heat,” but the real shocker was, well, “the shocker” (hand sanitizer, anyone?). We took a bad trip down US Route 93, the favored roadway of Thelemites in the Land of AZ and, now, around the globe, and we made a pit stop at the OZ Gay & Lesbian Bar before being treated to some “Black Rain” in the Land of Ozz. We met a cast of real characters, including Joe “America’s Toughest Sheriff ” Arpaio ( aka Nickel Bag Joe) and Jan “The Wicked Witch of the West” Brewer (Arizona’s Radiological-Technologist Governor), as well as the deadly duo of Barack “No-Denyin’-I’m-Hawaiian” Obama (the Comic-in-Chief, or, Usurper- in-Chief ) and Janet “The Man-Caused Disaster” Napolitano (the Secretary of"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"352 T—ffi Nffittfl 9/11?

Actually, we didn’t meet John last, and the five above weren’t the entire cast by any means. There was Elvis Presley (or, maybe not—Sheriff Joe was a little sketchy on the details), commentator Chuck Norris and fellow tough- man Steven Seagal, who helped the Sheriff lead a daring daytime raid on un- armed Jesus Llovera and his chickens in a self-propelled howitzer. Hero that he was, Seagal turned out to be just one member of Arpaio’s Insane Clown Posse (actually an armed “illegal immigration operations posse”), but one could be forgiven for making such a characterization given that the bunch also included Wyatt Earp and Dick Tracy, as well as the actors who played Willy Armitage from the Mission Impossible TV series and CBS’s The Incredible Hulk . Somewhere along the way, we learned about Hitler’s Daughter being in- volved in “Fingergate,” as well as some things we didn’t really want to know about Sheriff Joe’s pink underwear and green bologna. We became intimate with Aleister Crowley’s Liber 44 , the Mass of the Phoenix, as well as the num- ber 44 in a variety of other incarnations. We did a little bird-watching, sighting the Bennu, the Shen-Shen and the Rech— Go Big Red!— and were serenaded by shock-rocker and DeMolay International member Alice Cooper. We witnessed the Mayan Non-Apocalypse and gazed upon the Galactic Alignment, occurring primarily in the minds of New Agers, attended the Great Wedding, and contemplated the use of nuclear power. We discovered a hidden Biblical prophecy, sighted the Triple Cross and watched the fulfillment of the Prophecy of the Last Pope. On Jerusalem’s Skull Hill, we sifted through the pile of rubble formerly known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and in the heavens, we peered into the Womb of Creation, and saw a hawk, or a swan, and the crosses of two criminals, or the Thieves’ Cross...shit, I get confused. And just when we thought we’d seen one cross too many, here came the XXX Oympiad, followed by the 12 th Imam, the Superforce, “the Mother Lodge of the World” and the Ayatollah Khomeini. We watched Barack “I will win the war on Christmas” Obama drop a big one on the public unnoticed, and then grimaced as the Biggest Christmas Day Surprise in history was unwrapped. It was a red hot holiday, a Satanic Dawn Mass Sacrifice in Paradise Valley, and Santa left ashes for all the little boys and girls.

Gabby Giffords was among the wounded, and the 9/11 Birthday Girl was among the dead, along with Let’s Roll, excuse me, Federal Judge John Roll, and Gabe Zimmerman. The main target of the attack that morning, however, was the Messenger of God, Gabriel, who was symbolically struck down on the Eve of Agony—under the watchful eye, as well as the Arch, of Janus, or, if you prefer, the Royal Arch of Freemasonry. Identical twin astronauts came into play somehow, but I keep getting them confused with Dr. David Bowman from the movie 2001 , who I in turn get con- fused with the fellow of the same name who tended the wounded that morning in Tucson. One of the twins was Gabby’s husband, and one was in the Interna - tional Space Station at the time of the shooting, and one of them was a pilot on Discovery , no, wait, that was Dr. Bowman...oh, screw it.

We are not the brave souls of the Fellowship of the Ring, standing at the wrecked Black Gates of Mordor, celebrating the extinguishing of the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron.

As many are aware, this is a Latin expression meaning “Order out of Chaos.” It is a motto of the Thirty-third Degree of Freemasonry, and its invention is attributed to the Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish petite at Charleston, S.C.—the significance of which will become abundantly clear in the very next chapter. Chapter Twenty-One 1. In context of mind-control, The Joker is an elusive, chameleon-like persona—a wild card within the psychological programming system that can imitate anything and take any form necessary. Jokers will manifest when a mind control victim attempts to study the codes and programming that direct their actions.
