Examination of four of these samples, collected from separate sites, is reported in this paper. These red/gray chips show marked similarities in all four samples. One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later. The properties of these chips were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The red material contains grains approxi- mately 100 nm across which are largely iron oxide, while aluminum is contained in tiny plate-like structures. Separation of components using methyl ethyl ketone demonstrated that elemental aluminum is present. The iron oxide and aluminum are intimately mixed in the red material. When ignited in a DSC device the chips exhibit large but narrow exotherms oc- curring at approximately 430 ̊ C, far below the normal ignition temperature for conventional thermite. Numerous iron-rich spheres are clearly observed in the residue following the ignition of these peculiar red/gray chips. The red portion of these chips is found to be an unreacted thermitic material and highly energetic.

INTRODUCTION The destruction of three skyscrapers (WTC 1, 2 and 7) on September 11, 2001 was an immensely tragic catastrophe that not only impacted thousands of people and families di- rectly, due to injury and loss of life, but also provided the motivation for numerous expensive and radical changes in domestic and foreign policy. For these and other reasons, knowing what really happened that fateful day is of grave importance. A great deal of effort has been put forth by various gov- ernment-sponsored and -funded investigations, which led, in large part, to the reports released by FEMA [1] and NIST [2]. Other studies of the destruction have been less well *Address correspondence to these authors (NH) Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, DK-2100, Denmark; Tel: (+45)35321846; Fax: (+45)35320460; E-ma il: harrit@nano.ku.dk, (SEJ) at S&J Scientific Co., Provo, UT, 84606, USA; Tel: 801-735-5885; E-mail: Hardevidence@gmail.com publicized but are no less important to the outstanding obliga- tion that remains to the victims of that tragedy, to determine the whole truth of the events of that day [3-10]. A number of these studies have appropriately focused attention on the re- maining physical material, and on available photographs and video footage, as sources of evidence still in public hands, relating to the method of destruction of the three skyscrapers. The collapses of the three tallest WTC buildings were remarkable for their completeness, their near free-fall speed [11] their striking radial symmetry [1, 12] and the surpris- ingly large volume of fine toxic dust [13] that was generated. In order to better understand these features of the destruc- tion, the authors initiated an examination of this dust. In June 2007, Dr. Steven Jones observed distinctive bi-layered chips, with both a red and a gray layer, in a sample of the WTC dust. Initially, it was suspected these might be dried paint chips, but after closer inspection and testing, it was shown that this was not the case. Further testing was then performed on the red/gray chips in an attempt to ascertain their compo- "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"8 The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Volume 2 Harrit et al. sition and properties. The authors also obtained and exam- ined additional samples of WTC dust which had been col- lected by independent observers on, or very soon after, 9/11. All of the samples examined contained these very small, peculiar red/gray chips. Previous studies discussing observa- tions of the WTC dust include reports by the RJ Lee Com- pany [14], the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [15], McGee et al . [13] and Lioy et al . [16] Some of these studies con- firmed the finding of iron-rich microspheres, which are also peculiar [5, 8, 11, 13-15] but the red/gray chips analyzed in this study have apparently not been discussed in previously published reports. It is worth emphasizing that one sample was collected about ten minutes after the collapse of the sec- ond Tower, so it cannot possibly have been contaminated by clean-up operations [17]. MATERIALS AND METHODS 1. Provenance of the Samples Analyzed for this Report In a paper presented first online in autumn 2006 regard- ing anomalies observed in the World Trade Center destruc- tion [6], a general request was issued for samples of the WTC dust. The expectation at that time was that a careful examination of the dust might yield evidence to support the hypothesis that explosive materials other than jet fuel caused the extraordinarily rapid and essentially total destruction of the WTC buildings. It was learned that a number of people had saved samples of the copious, dense dust, which spread and settled across Manhattan. Several of these people sent portions of their samples to members of this research group. This paper dis- cusses four separate dust samples collected on or shortly after 9/11/2001. Each sample was found to contain red/gray chips. All four samples were originally collected by private citizens who lived in New York City at the time of the trag- edy. These citizens came forward and provided samples for analysis in the public interest, allowing study of the 9/11 dust for whatever facts about the day might be learned from the dust. A map showing the locations where the four sam- ples were collected is presented as Fig. ( 1 ). Fig. (1).

He saw the tower fall and was enveloped by the resulting thick dust which settled throughout the area. He swept a handful of the dust from a rail on the pedestrian walkway near the end of the bridge, about ten minutes after the fall of the North Tower. He then went to visit his friend, Mr. Tom Breidenbach, carrying the dust in his hand, and the two of them discussed the dust and decided to save it in a plastic bag. On 11/15/2007, Breidenbach sent a portion of this dust to Dr. Jones for analysis. Breidenbach has also recorded his testimony about the collection of this dust sample on video- tape [17]. Thus, the Delessio/Breidenbach sample was col- lected about ten minutes after the second tower collapsed. It was, therefore, definitely not contaminated by the steel- cutting or clean-up operations at Ground Zero, which began later. Furthermore, it is not mixed with dust from WTC 7, which fell hours later. On the morning of 9/12/2001, Mr. Stephen White of New York City entered a room in his apartment on the 8th floor of 1 Hudson Street, about five blocks from the WTC. He found a layer of dust about an inch thick on a stack of folded laun- dry near a window which was open about 4 inches (10 cm). Evidently the open window had allowed a significant amount of dust from the WTC destruction the day before to enter the room and cover the laundry. He saved some of the dust and, on 2/02/2008, sent a sample directly to Dr. Jones for analy- sis. Another sample was collected from the apartment build- ing at 16 Hudson Street by Mr. Jody Intermont at about 2 pm on 9/12/2001. Two small samples of this dust were simulta- neously sent to Dr. Jones and to Kevin Ryan on 2/02/2008 for analysis. Intermont sent a signed affidavit with each sample verifying that he had personally collected the (now- split) sample; he wrote: “This dust, which came from the ‘collapsed’ World Trade Center Towers, was collected from my loft at the corner of Reade Street and Hud- son Street on September 12, 2001. I give per- mission to use my name in connection to this evidence”. [Signed 31 January 2008 in the pres- ence of a witness who also signed his name]. On the morning of 9/11/2001, Ms. Janette MacKinlay was in her fourth-floor apartment at 113 Cedar St./110 Lib- erty St. in New York City, across the street from the WTC plaza. As the South Tower collapsed, the flowing cloud of dust and debris caused windows of her apartment to break inward and dust filled her apartment. She escaped by quickly wrapping a wet towel around her head and exiting the build- ing. The building was closed for entry for about a week. As soon as Ms. MacKinlay was allowed to re-enter her apart- ment, she did so and began cleaning up. There was a thick layer of dust on the floor. She collected some of it into a large sealable plastic bag for possible later use in an art piece. Ms. MacKinlay responded to the request in the 2006 paper by Dr. Jones by sending him a dust sample. In No- vember 2006, Dr. Jones traveled to California to visit Ms. MacKinlay at her new location, and in the company of sev- eral witnesses collected a second sample of the WTC dust directly from her large plastic bag where the dust was stored. She has also sent samples directly to Dr. Jeffrey Farrer and Kevin Ryan. Results from their studies form part of this re- port. Another dust sample was collected by an individual from a window sill of a building on Potter Street in NYC. He has not given permission for his name to be disclosed, therefore his material is not included in this study. That sample, how- ever, contained red/gray chips of the same general composi- tion as the samples described here. 2. Chip Size, Isolation, and Examination For clarification, the dust samples collected and sent to the authors by Ms. Janette MacKinlay will be sample 1; the sample collected by Mr. Frank Delassio, or the Delas- sio/Breidenbach sample, will be sample 2; the sample col- lected by Mr. Jody Intermont will be sample 3; and the sam- ple collected by Mr. Stephen White will be sample 4. The red/gray chips are attracted by a magnet, which facilitates collection and separation of the chips from the bulk of the dust. A small permanent magnet in its own plastic bag was used to attract and collect the chips from dust samples. The chips are typically small but readily discernible by eye due to their distinctive color. They are of variable size with major dimensions of roughly 0.2 to 3 mm. Thicknesses vary from roughly 10 to 100 microns for each layer (red and gray). Samples of WTC dust from these and other collectors have been sent directly from collectors to various scientists (in- cluding some not on this research team) who have also found such red/gray chips in the dust from the World Trade Center destruction. An FEI XL30-SFEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to perform secondary-electron (SE) imag- ing and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging. The SE imag- ing was used to look at the surface topography and porosity of the red/gray chips, while the BSE imaging was used to distinguish variations in average atomic number, Z. The mi- croscope was also equipped with an EDAX X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (XEDS) system. The XEDS system uses a silicon detector (SiLi) with resolution better than 135 eV. The spectrum resolution was set to 10 eV per channel. Operating conditions for the acquired XEDS spectra were 20 keV beam energy (unless otherwise specified) and 40-120 second acquisition time (livetime). XEDS maps were ac- quired using the same system at a beam energy of 10 keV. For general surface analysis in the SEM, dust samples were mounted to carbon conductive tabs. The samples were left unwashed and uncoated unless otherwise specified. In order to more closely observe the characteristics of the red and gray layers, and to eliminate the possibility of surface contamination from other dust particles, several red/gray chips from each of the four WTC dust samples were frac- tured. The clean, cross-section surfaces were then studied by BSE imaging and XEDS."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"10 The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Volume 2 Harrit et al. Some samples were also tested in a differential scanning calorimeter (Netzsch DSC 404C) to measure heat flow into or out of the red/gray chips. The DSC tests were conducted with a linear heating rate of 10 ̊ C per minute up to a tem- perature of 700 ̊ C. During heating, the samples were con- tained in alumina pans and air was allowed to flow at 55 milliliters per minute during the heating. The plots were gen- erated by acquiring data points at a rate of 20 points per ̊ C or 200 points per minute. The equipment was calibrated to display the data in watts per gram. The plots were set to dis- play positive heat flow out of the sample such that exother- mic behavior of the sample would yield a peak and endo- thermic behavior a trough. The dust samples were also examined by visible-light microscopy (VLM) through a Nikon Epiphot 200 stereomi- croscope, an Olympus BX60 stereomicroscope and a Nikon Labophot microscope and camera. RESULTS 1. Characterization of the Red/Gray Chips Red/gray chips were found in all of the dust samples col- lected. An analysis of the chips was performed to assess the similarity of the chips and to determine the chemistry and materials that make up the chips. Fig. ( 2 ) displays photomi- crographs of red/gray chips from each of the four WTC dust samples. Note the scale marker in each image as they were acquired at different magnifications. At approximately 2.5 mm in length, the chip in Fig. ( 2a ) was one of the larger chips collected. The mass of this chip was approximately 0.7 mg. All of the chips used in the study had a gray layer and a red layer and were attracted by a magnet. The inset image in Fig. ( 2d ) shows the chip in cross section, which reveals the gray layer. The gray layer is also partially visible in Fig. ( 2b ). Similarities between the samples are already evident from these photographs. Fig. ( 3 ) shows three images for comparison of views of the same set of chips using different methods. Fig. ( 3a ) is a VLM photomicrograph of a group of particles, which shows the red material and in some cases the adhering gray mate- rial. Fig. ( 3b , c ) are, respectively, a secondary electron (SE) image and a backscattered electron (BSE) image of the same group of particles, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) without a conductive coating over the sample. It can be seen in the SE image that the red layer of the particles has very bright regions caused by a slight accumulation of charge under the electron beam, owing to the relatively poor conductivity of the red layer (see Discussion section). The BSE image shows the red layer darker than the gray layer, Fig. (2). Photomicrographs of red/gray chips from samples 1-4 of the WTC dust involved in this study, shown in ( a )-( d ) respectively.

A higher-magnification BSE image of the corner of one of the chips, shown in Fig. ( 4 ), allows for closer examination of the difference in grayscale intensity of the two layers and confirms the higher average atomic number of the gray layer. The red material also shows specks and other heterogene- ities, in marked contrast to the smooth gray layer. Newly fractured cross sections of red/gray chips from the four different dust samples are shown by BSE imaging in Fig. ( 5 ). These four cross sections are representative of all the red/gray chips studied from the dust samples. The BSE images illustrate the finding that all of the red layers studied contained small bright particles or grains characterized by a high average atomic number. The size and presence of the particles was found to be consistent throughout the layers, but the concentration of the particles was found to vary lo- cally, as can be seen from the images. Fig. (3).

X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) analyses of both the red and gray layers from cross sections prepared from the four dust samples were performed and representa- tive spectra are shown in Figs. ( 6 , 7 ). The four spectra in Fig. ( 6 ) indicate that the gray layers are consistently characterized by high iron and oxygen content including a smaller amount of carbon. The chemical signatures found in the red layers are also quite consistent (Fig. 7 ), each showing the presence of aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O), and a significant carbon (C) peak as well. At still higher magnifications, BSE imaging of the red layer illustrates the similarity between the different dust samples. BSE images of small but representative portions of each red-layer cross section are shown in Fig. ( 8 ). The re- sults indicate that the small particles with very high BSE intensity (brightness) are consistently 100 nm in size and have a faceted appearance. These bright particles are seen intermixed with plate-like particles that have intermediate BSE intensity and are approximately 40 nm thick and up to about 1 micron across. Furthermore, by comparing the BSE image in Fig. ( 8a ) to the SE image in Fig. ( 9 ), it can be seen that all of the particles are embedded in an unstructured ma- trix which gives a dark BSE intensity. XEDS maps of the cross-section surface of the red layer were acquired at a beam energy of 10 kV. The acquisition area of the maps is shown by the BSE image in Fig. ( 10a ). The XEDS maps, several of which are shown in Fig. ( 10b-f ), indicate by color, the degree to which the particular element is present at or near the surface from point to point across the area. The results indicate that the smaller particles with very bright BSE intensity are associated with the regions of high Fe and O. The plate-like particles with intermediate BSE intensity appear to be associated with the regions of high Al and Si. The O map (d) also indicates oxygen present, to a lesser degree, in the location of the Al and Si. However, it is inconclusive from these data whether the O is associated with Si or Al or both. The carbon map appears less defini- tive, that is, it does not appear to be associated with a par- ticular particle or group of particles, but rather with the ma- trix material. In order to learn more from these findings, a focused electron beam was placed directly onto the different parti- cles, and the XEDS data were collected. By placing the beam on a cluster of plate-like particles, the spectrum in Fig. ( 11a ) was generated. The spectrum in Fig. ( 11b ) was acquired Fig. (5).

Again it was observed that the thin sheet-like particles are rich in Al and Si whereas the bright faceted grains are rich in Fe. Both spectra display significant carbon and oxygen, which may be partially due to the beam spreading and receiving an over- lapping X-ray signal from the matrix material as well as par- ticles below the surface. The beam energy (20 keV) is such that the volume of material from which the X-ray signal is generated is larger than the particles. Hence, some Al and Si are seen in Fig. ( 11b ) which may not be inherent in the fac- eted grains, and some Fe is seen in Fig. ( 11a ), which may not be inherent in the plate-like particles. The consistently rhombic-shaped, faceted appearance of the iron-rich grains strongly suggests that they are crystal- line. From these data, it is determined that the red/gray chips from different WTC dust samples are extremely similar in their chemical and structural makeup. It is also shown that within the red layer there is an intimate mixing of the Fe-rich grains and Al/Si plate-like particles and that these particles are embedded in a carbon-rich matrix. 2.

The initial objective was to compare the behav- ior of the red layer with paint when soaked in a strong or- ganic solvent known to soften and dissolve paint. Red/gray chips were soaked in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) for 55 hours with frequent agitation and subsequently dried in air over several days. The chips showed significant swelling of the red layer, but with no apparent dissolution. In marked contrast, paint chips softened and partly dissolved when similarly soaked in MEK. It was discovered in this process that a significant migration and segregation of aluminum had occurred in the red-chip material. This allowed us to assess whether some of the aluminum was in elemental form. The chip that was used for this experiment was extracted from dust sample 2 and is shown in the images below. Fig. ( 12a ) shows an SE image of the chip prior to the MEK treatment. It is positioned with the interface between the red and gray layers nearly parallel to the plane of the image. Fig. ( 12b ) shows a BSE image of the chip after the MEK soak. Note that the chip fractured during the MEK treatment and handling. In this image the red layer and gray layer are side by side so that the interface between the layers is edge-on (perpendicular to the plane of the image) with the gray layer on the right. The red layer of the chip was found, by visual inspection, to have swelled out from the gray layer by a fac- tor of roughly 5 times its original thickness. The photomi- crograph shown in Fig. ( 13 ) also shows the chip after the MEK soak. The red layer can be seen extending out from the gray layer. Fig. (13). Photomicrograph of the MEK treated chip. Prior to soaking the chip in MEK an XEDS spectrum was acquired from an area of the red-layer surface. The resulting spectrum, shown in Fig. ( 14 ), produced the expected peaks for Fe, Si, Al, O, and C. Other peaks included calcium, sul- fur, zinc, chromium and potassium. The occurrence of these elements could be attributed to surface contamination due to the fact that the analysis was performed on the as-collected surface of the red layer. The large Ca and S peaks may be due to contamination with gypsum from the pulverized wall- board material in the buildings. Fig. (14). XEDS spectrum of red side before soaking in MEK. No- tice the presence of Zn and Cr, which are sometimes seen in the red layers. The large Ca and S peaks may be due to surface contamina- tion with wallboard material. XEDS maps were acquired from the swollen red material at a beam energy of 10 kV, in order to determine the loca- tions of various elements following the MEK treatment. The data shown in Fig. ( 15 ) illustrate regions where iron, alumi- num and silicon are concentrated. Furthermore, the data in- dicate that wherever silicon or iron is concentrated, oxygen is also concentrated. On the other hand, there also exist re- gions where the aluminum is concentrated but where the Fig. (12).

To confirm and to quantify these observations, XEDS spectra (subse- quent plots) were acquired from specific regions of high Si, Al and Fe concentrations. Focusing the electron beam on a region rich in silicon, located in Fig. ( 15e ), we find silicon and oxygen and very little else (Fig. 16 ). Evidently the solvent has disrupted the matrix holding the various particles, allowing some migra- tion and separation of the components. This is a significant result for it means that the aluminum and silicon are not bound chemically. The next XEDS spectrum (Fig. 17 ) was acquired from a region that showed a high concentration of aluminum. Using a conventional quantification routine, it was found that the aluminum significantly exceeded the oxygen present (ap- proximately a 3:1 ratio). Thus, while some of the aluminum may be oxidized, there is insufficient oxygen present to ac- count for all of the aluminum; some of the aluminum must therefore exist in elemental form in the red material. This is an important result. Aluminum particles are covered with a layer of aluminum oxide irrespective of size, thus it is rea- sonable to find a significant oxygen content with the alumi- num, given the very high surface area to volume ratio of these very fine particles.

XEDS spectrum from a silicon-rich region on the porous red matrix of the MEK-treated red material. Fig. (17). XEDS spectrum obtained at 10 kV from a probe of the region of high aluminum concentration on the MEK-soaked red chip. Next a region of particularly high iron concentration was analyzed, yielding the XEDS spectrum shown in Fig. ( 18 ). Fig. (18). XEDS spectrum obtained from a probe of the region of high iron concentration on the MEK-soaked red chip, acquired with a 15 kV beam. Oxygen is very consistently found in high concentration with the iron in the red material even after soaking in MEK solvent (Fig. 15 ), and in Fig. ( 18 ) an abundance of oxygen is found relative to iron. Based on quantification of the XEDS spectra, and after accounting for oxygen fractions to trace ele- ments, it is found that the Fe:O ratio for the spectrum in Fig. ( 18 ) is approximately 2:3. This indicates that the iron is oxidized and apparently in oxidation state III, indicating that Fe 2 O 3 , or perhaps an iron (III) oxo-bridged polymer, is present. To check the quantification method, tests were performed with the known chemical, iron (III) oxide, and the elemental- quantification was found to yield consistent and repeatable results for iron and oxygen. In particular we made eight 50- second measurements on Fe 2 O 3 samples and found consis- tency for iron (± 6.2%, 1 sigma) and for oxygen (± 3.4%, 1 sigma) with the O/Fe ratio consistently near 1.5 as expected. The existence of elemental aluminum and iron oxide leads to the obvious hypothesis that the material may contain ther- mite. However, before concluding that the red material found in the WTC dust is thermitic, further testing would be required. For example, how does the material behave when heated in a sensitive calorimeter? If the material does not react vigorously it may be argued that although ingredients of thermite are present, the material may not really be thermitic. 3. Thermal Analysis using Differential Scanning Calorimetry Red/gray chips were subjected to heating using a differ- ential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The data shown in Fig. ( 19 ) demonstrate that the red/gray chips from different WTC samples all ignited in the range 415-435 ̊ C. The energy re- lease for each exotherm can be estimated by integrating with respect to time under the narrow peak. Proceeding from the smallest to largest peaks, the yields are estimated to be ap- proximately 1.5, 3, 6 and 7.5 kJ/g respectively. Variations in peak height as well as yield estimates are not surprising, since the mass used to determine the scale of the signal, shown in the DSC traces, included the mass of the gray layer. The gray layer was found to consist mostly of iron oxide so that it probably does not contribute to the exotherm, and yet this layer varies greatly in mass from chip to chip. 4. Observation of Iron-Rich Sphere Formation Upon Ignition of Chips in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter In the post-DSC residue, charred-porous material and numerous microspheres and spheroids were observed. Many of these were analyzed, and it was found that some were iron-rich, which appear shiny and silvery in the optical mi- croscope, and some were silicon-rich, which appear trans- parent or translucent when viewed with white light; see pho- tographs taken using a Nikon microscope (Fig. 20 ). The abundant iron-rich spheres are of particular interest in this study; none were observed in these particular chips prior to DSC-heating. Spheres rich in iron already demon- strate the occurrence of very high temperatures, well above the 700 ̊ C temperature reached in the DSC, in view of the high melting point of iron and iron oxide [5]. Such high tem- peratures indicate that a chemical reaction occurred. Using back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging, spheres were selected in the post-DSC residue which appeared to be rich in iron. An example is shown in Fig. ( 21 ) along with the corresponding XEDS spectrum for this sphere. - ) \t\u000e \u00150 \u0019\f \t\u000e \t\u000e \u0003 \u0006 \u0002 6 : 9 < = > ; \u000e\u000f\u0010 \u0011\u0017 \u0019 / )0 \u0002 \u0003 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \u0007 \b \t \u000b \u0002\u0003\u0004 \f\r \f\r \u000e \u000f \u0010\u0011 \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005 \u0006 \u0007 \b \t \u000b \u0002\u0003\u0004 \f\r\u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011 \u0012 \u0013 \u0014\u0015"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20 The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Volume 2 Harrit et al.

In the case of this iron-rich spheroid, the iron content exceeds the oxygen content by approximately a factor of two, so substantial elemental iron must be present. This result was repeated in other iron-rich spheroids in the post-DSC sample as well as in spots in the residue which did not form into spheres. Spheroids were observed with Fe:O ratios up to approximately 4:1. Other iron-rich spheres were found in the post-DSC residue which contained iron along with aluminum and oxygen (see Dis- cussion section). That thermitic reactions from the red/gray chips have indeed occurred in the DSC (rising temperature method of ignition) is confirmed by the combined observation of 1) highly energetic reactions occurring at approximately 430 ̊ C, 2) iron-rich sphere formation so that the product must have been sufficiently hot to be molten (over 1400 ̊ C for iron and iron oxide), 3) spheres, spheroids and non- spheroidal residues in which the iron content exceeds the oxygen content. Significant elemental iron is now present as expected from the thermitic reduction-oxidation reaction of aluminum and iron oxide. The evidence for active, highly energetic thermitic mate- rial in the WTC dust is compelling. 5. Flame/Ignition Tests The DSC used in our studies does not allow for visual in- spection of the energetic reaction. Therefore tests were also performed with a small oxyacetylene flame applied to red/gray chips. Samples were either heated on a graphite block (Fig. 22 ) Fig. (21).

Several paint samples were also tested and in each case, the paint sample was immediately reduced to fragile ashes by the hot flame. This was not the case, however, with any of the red/gray chips from the World Trade Center dust. The first WTC red/gray chip so tested was approximately 1mm \u0001 1mm. After a few seconds of heating, the high-speed ejection of a hot particle was observed under the hand of the person holding the torch (Fig. 22 ). The intense light and bright orange color of the particle attest to its high tempera- ture. In this case, the attempt to recover the diminutive end- product of the reaction was unsuccessful. A short video clip of the test (including slow-motion) is available here: http://journalof911studies.com/volume/2008/oxy_redchip_sl ow.mov In a later flame-ignition test, the end product was recov- ered and is shown in the photomicrograph and SEM image in Fig. ( 23 ). Once again, the formation of iron-rich semi- spherical shapes shows that the residue had been melted, enabling surface tension of the liquid to pull it into spherical shapes. However, the evidence obtained in the DSC analyses is more compelling that a thermitic reaction actually occurs as in that case ignition is observed when the red material is heated to no more than 430 ̊ C. DISCUSSION All of the dust samples that were inspected were found to contain red/gray chips. The chips are characterized by a red layer in which XEDS analysis identifies carbon, oxygen, aluminum, silicon, and iron, and a gray layer in which mainly iron and oxygen are found.

The BSE imaging also shows the consistency of the red layers by re- vealing the size and morphology of the particles that are con- tained in the bulk of the layers. The results clearly show the similarities of the red/gray chips from the different dust samples from all four sites. There are a number of questions raised by our results. 1. How Much of the Energetic Red Material Survived During the WTC Destruction? In the sample provided by collector J. MacKinlay the fraction of red/gray chips was roughly estimated. Fifteen small chips having a total mass of 1.74 mg were extracted from a 1.6 g sample of dust from which readily identifiable glass and concrete fragments had been removed by hand. Thus the fraction of red/gray chips was approximately 0.1% by weight in the separated dust Another sampling showed 69 small red/gray chips in a 4.9 g sample of sepa- rated dust. Further samples are being analyzed to refine this estimate. The fall of the WTC Towers produced enormous clouds of dust whose total mass is difficult to ascertain; but clearly the total mass of red/gray chips in the WTC dust must be substantial given the fraction observed in these sam- plings. 2. Is the Red Material Thermitic in Nature? Our observations show that the red material contains sub- stantial amounts of aluminum, iron and oxygen, mixed to- gether very finely. In the sample soaked in MEK, we ob- served a clear migration and aggregation of the aluminum away from other elements and determined that elemental aluminum and iron oxide must be present. In the product collected after DSC ignition, we found spheres which were not initially present. Many of these spheres were iron rich and elemental iron was found in the post-ignition debris. Further, the DSC traces demonstrate that the red/gray chips react vigorously at a temperature below the melting point of aluminum and below the ignition (oxidation) point of ultra- fine grain (UFG) aluminum in air [18]. These observations reminded us of nano-thermite fabricated at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and elsewhere; available papers describe this material as an intimate mixture of UFG aluminum and iron oxide in nano-thermite composites to form pyrotechnics or explosives [19-21]. The thermite reac- tion involves aluminum and a metal oxide, as in this typical reaction with iron oxide: 2Al + Fe 2 O 3 \u0003 Al 2 O 3 + 2Fe (molten iron), \u0002 H = \u0001 853.5 kJ/mole. Commercially available thermite behaves as an incendi- ary when ignited [6], but when the ingredients are ultra-fine grain (UFG) and are intimately mixed, this “nano-thermite” reacts very rapidly, even explosively, and is sometimes re- ferred to as “super-thermite” [20, 22]. We would like to make detailed comparisons of the red chips with known super-thermite composites, along with comparisons of the products following ignition, but there are many forms of this high-tech thermite, and this comparison must wait for a future study. Meanwhile, we compare with products of commercially available (macro-) thermite. Dur- ing ignition of thermite, we have observed that many spheres and spheroids are formed as part of the molten product of the reaction is vigorously scattered. These particles tend to be- come spherical due to surface tension and, being small, are rapidly cooled and solidify as they fall through the air, thus their spherical shape is preserved. To facilitate comparisons between the products of red/gray chip ignition and commercial thermite ignition, we juxtapose the respective images and XEDS spectra. We observe that the spheroidal residues from ignition of red chips (Figs. 25 , 26 ) possess a strikingly similar chemical signature to a typical XEDS spectrum from a spheroid gen- erated by commercial thermite (Fig. 24 ). This similarity sup- ports our hypothesis that the red chips are indeed a form of thermite. Images of spheroids XEDS spectra of spheroids Fig. (24).

These con- tain the same elements as the residue of thermite, as noted in a previous paper [5]. We show spheres found in the WTC dust (Fig. 27 ) and a representative XEDS spectrum from such a sphere (Fig. 28 ); we invite the reader to compare these results with those found for ignition of commercial thermite and for ignition of red/gray chips (above). 3. Could the Red Material Be Unreacted “Super- Thermite”? We have noted that ordinary thermite acts as an incendi- ary when ignited. However, when the ingredients are ultra- fine-grain and are intimately mixed, the mixture reacts very rapidly, even explosively [20]. Thus, there is a highly ener- getic form of thermite known as an energetic nanocomposite or “super-thermite,” composed of aluminum and iron oxide with at least one component being approximately 100 nm or less, often along with silicon and carbon [19-28]. “Reaction rates between nanosize aluminum and metal oxides can be significantly greater than those observed with traditional micron-size thermite powders. Reactions occurring between metal and metal oxide powders are accompa- nied by the generation of high temperatures (>3000 K). Super-thermites, formed by mixing of aluminum and metal oxide nanopowders re- sult in energy release rate by two orders of magnitude higher than similar mixtures consist- ing of micron size reactants” [22]. The red layer of the red/gray chips is most interesting in that it contains aluminum, iron and oxygen components which are intimately mixed at a scale of approximately 100 nanometers (nm) or less. Now we compare a DSC trace ob- tained for a WTC red/gray chip with a DSC trace obtained for known super-thermite (see Fig. ( 29 )). Ordinary thermite ignites at a much higher temperature (about 900 ̊ C or above) and gives a significantly broader trace than super-thermite [21]. All these data suggest that the thermitic material found in the WTC dust is a form of nano- thermite, not ordinary (macro-) thermite. We make no at- tempt to specify the particular form of nano-thermite present until more is learned about the red material and especially about the nature of the organic material it contains. 4. Did the Technology to Make Highly Exothermic Nano- composites Exist Prior to 9/11/2001? We find the answer in a report by Gash et al . dated April 2000, seventeen months before the tragedy: “Nanostructured composites are multicompo- nent materials in which at least one of the com- ponent phases has one or more dimensions (length, width, or thickness) in the nanometer size range, defined as 1 to 100 nm. Energetic nanocomposites are a class of material that have both a fuel and oxidizer component intimately mixed and where at least one of the component phases meets the size definition. A sol-gel de- rived pyrotechnic is an example of an energetic nanocomposite, in which metal-oxide nanopar- ticles react with metals or other fuels in very exothermic reactions. The fuel resides within the pores of the solid matrix while the oxidizer comprises at least a portion of the skeletal ma- Fig. (29).

The compositions are stable, safe and can be readily ignited” [19]. We gather that the technology to make materials re- markably fitting the characterization of the red chips was available by April 2000. In the same report, the scientists noted that “polymers” can be added to the nanocomposite: “This sol-gel method allows for the addition of insoluble materials (e.g., metals or polymers) to the viscous sol, just before gelation, to produce a uniformly distributed and energetic nanocom- posite upon gelation. Al metal (as a fine pow- der, ~6 μ m diameter) was added to some Fe x O y gel syntheses just before gelation to produce Fe x O y /Al(s) pyrotechnic nanocomposites.... These nanocomposites were subsequently proc- essed to make both a xerogel and aerogel of the material.... The pyrotechnic nanocomposite can be ignited using a propane torch” [19]. Indeed, the red chips can be ignited using a torch and they have properties of a pyrotechnic nanocomposite. All the required ingredients are present – aluminum, iron, oxygen, silicon, and carbon – and they are incorporated in such a way that the chip forms (and sometimes ejects) very hot material when ignited. The Gash report describes FTIR spectra which characterize this energetic material. We have performed these same tests and will report the results elsewhere. We note that polymers in the matrix may be responsible for ab- sorption of MEK and the subsequent swelling which we ob- served [29]. A report on an April 2001 conference discloses who was known to be working on such explosives at that time: The 221st National Meeting of the American Chemical Society held during April 2001 in San Diego featured a symposium on Defense Appli- cations of Nanomaterials. One of the 4 sessions was titled nanoenergetics.... This session pro- vided a good representation of the breadth of work ongoing in this field, which is roughly 10 years old.... At this point in time, all of the military services and some DOE and academic laboratories have active R&D programs aimed at exploiting the unique properties of nano- materials that have potential to be used in energetic formulations for advanced explo- sives.... nanoenergetics hold promise as use- ful ingredients for the thermobaric (TBX) and TBX-like weapons , particularly due to their high degree of tailorability with regards to energy release and impulse management [20]. The feature of “impulse management” may be signifi- cant. It is possible that formulations may be chosen to have just sufficient percussive effect to achieve the desired frag- mentation while minimizing the noise level. 5. Can Super-Thermite be Handled Safely? The April 2000 report by Gash et al . states: “The nature of the wet nanocomposites also af- fords an additional degree of safety. In our hands, the wet pyrotechnic nanocomposites cannot be ignited until the drying process is complete. This property should allow the pro- duction of a large quantity of the pyrotechnics that can be stored safely for some time and dried shortly before its use” [19]. Safe handling of the malleable sol-gel material allows easy coating of surfaces (such as steel), which the same group, in a subsequent report, says they have achieved. “The sol-gel process is very amenable to dip-, spin-, and spray-coating technologies to coat surfaces. We have utilized this property to dip- coat various substrates to make sol-gel Fe 2 O 3 /Al/Viton coatings. The energetic coating dries to give a nice adherent film.” “We have prepared fine powders, pressed pellets, cast monoliths, and thin films of the hybrid inor- ganic/organic energetic nanocomposite” [25]. Thus, the energetic nano-composite can be sprayed or even “painted” onto surfaces, effectively forming an ener- getic or even explosive paint. The red chips we found in the WTC dust conform to their description of “thin films” of “hybrid inorganic/organic energetic nanocomposite”. Indeed, the descriptive terms “energetic coating” and “nice adherent film” fit very well with our observations of the red-chips which survived the WTC destruction. We cannot determine at this time, however, whether the thinness of the chips re- sulted from the application method or the manner of reac- tion. While the application of a thin film might have suited specific desired outcomes, it is also possible that the quench- ing effect of the steel the material was in contact with may have prevented a thin film of a larger mass from reacting. The fact that most of the chips have a distinctive gray layer suggests that the unreacted material was in close contact with something else, either its target, a container, or an adhe- sive. Clapsaddle et al. further noted in their report: “These results indicate that under ambient con- ditions the hybrid inorganic/organic energetic composite is very stable to impact, is spark in- sensitive, and only very slightly friction sensi- tive. As noted in the Experimental section of this report, in our hands wet hybrid nanocompo- sites are safe to handle and difficult to thermal [sic] ignite. However, once dry the material burns very vigorously and rapidly with the evo- lution of significant amounts of gaseous spe- cies” [24]. The organic component contributes to the rapid gas evo- lution and explosive nature of these energetic super- thermites when dry [24]. “Super-thermite electric matches” have been developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for which “applications include triggering explosives for ... demolition” [30]. It is indeed possible that such matches, which are designed to be ignited by a simple electric pulse, could contain material"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Active Thermitic Material Found in WTC Dust The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Volume 2 27 similar to the red material we have found in the WTC dust. With regard to the safety of super-thermite matches, the Los Alamos announcement notes: “Unfortunately, conventional electric matches use lead containing compounds that are ex- tremely sensitive to impact, friction, static, and heat stimuli, thereby making them dangerous to handle. In addition, these compounds produce toxic smoke. The Super-Thermite electric matches produce no toxic lead smoke and are safer to use because they resist friction, im- pact, heat, and static discharge through the composition, thereby minimizing accidental ig- nition. They can be designed to create various thermal-initiating outputs—simple sparks, hot slag, droplets, or flames—depending on the needs of different applications” [30]. 6. What is the Energy Release of Super-Thermite Com- pared to Conventional Explosives? A graph in an article on nanostructured energetic materi- als [21] shows that the energy/volume yield for Al/Fe 2 O 3 composite material exceeds that of TNT, HMX and TATB explosives commonly used in demolitions (see Fig. ( 30 )). It is striking that some of the red/gray chips release more energy in kJ/g than does ordinary thermite, as shown in the blue bar graphs above. The theoretical maximum for ther- mite is 3.9 kJ/g [27]. We suggest that the organic material in evidence in the red/gray chips is also highly energetic, most likely producing gas to provide explosive pressure. Again, conventional thermite is regarded as an incendiary whereas super-thermite, which may include organic ingredients for rapid gas generation, is considered a pyrotechnic or explo- sive [6, 24]. As this test was done in air it is possible that some of the enhancement of energy output may have come from air oxidation of the organic component. 7. Could the Red Chip Material be Ordinary Paint? We measured the resistivity of the red material (with very little gray adhering to one side) using a Fluke 8842A mul- timeter in order to compare with ordinary paints, using the formula: Specific resistivity = RA / L where R = resistance (ohms); A = cross-sectional area (m 2 ); L = thickness (m). Given the small size of the red chip, about 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm, we used two probes and obtained a rough value of ap- proximately 10 ohm-m. This is several orders of magnitude less than paint coatings we found tabulated which are typi- cally over 10 10 ohm-m [31]. Another test, described above, involved subjection of red chips to methyl ethyl ketone solvent for tens of hours, with agitation. The red material did swell but did not dissolve, and a hard silicon-rich matrix remained after this procedure. On the other hand, paint samples in the same exposure to MEK solvent became limp and showed significant dissolution, as expected since MEK is a paint solvent. Further, we have shown that the red material contains both elemental aluminum and iron oxide, the ingredients of thermite, in interesting configuration and intimate mixing in the surviving chips (see Results, section 1). The species are small (e.g., the iron oxide grains are roughly 100 nm across) in a matrix including silicon and carbon, suggesting a super- thermite composite. Red chips when ignited produce very high temperatures even now, several years after the 9/11 tragedy, as shown by the bright flash observed and the pro- 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Energy (kJ) HMX TNT TATB Al/Fe2O3 WTC Chip 1 WTC Chip 2 WTC Chip 3 WTC Chip 4 Energy by volume (kJ/cc) Energy by mass (kJ/g) Fig. (30).

Correspondingly, the DSC tests demon- strate the release of high enthalpy, actually exceeding that of pure thermite. Furthermore, the energy is released over a short period of time, shown by the narrowness of the peak in Fig. ( 29 ). The post-DSC-test residue contains microspheres in which the iron exceeds the oxygen content, implying that at least some of the iron oxide has been reduced in the reac- tion. If a paint were devised that incorporated these very energetic materials, it would be highly dangerous when dry and most unlikely to receive regulatory approval for building use. To merit consideration, any assertion that a prosaic sub- stance such as paint could match the characteristics we have described would have to be accompanied by empirical dem- onstration using a sample of the proposed material, including SEM/XEDS and DSC analyses. 8. What Future Studies are Contemplated? We observe that the total energy released from some of the red chips exceeds the theoretical limit for thermite alone (3.9 kJ/g). One possibility is that the organic material in the red layer is itself energetic. Determination of the chemical compound(s) involved in the organic component of the red material would promote understanding. Further studies of the red material (separated from the gray material) compared to known super-thermite variants using DSC, TGA, FTIR (etc.) analyses would certainly be in order. In particular, NMR and GC-mass spectroscopy and related studies are urged to iden- tify the organic material. We have observed that some chips have additional ele- ments such as potassium, lead, barium and copper. Are these significant, and why do such elements appear in some red chips and not others? An example is shown in Fig. ( 31 ) which shows significant Pb along with C, O, Fe, and Al and displays multiple red and gray layers. In addition, the gray-layer material demands further study. What is its purpose? Sometimes the gray material ap- pears in multiple layers, as seen in Fig. ( 32 ). Fig. (31). Photomicrograph of a red/gray chip found in sample 3, showing multiple layers and an unusual light-gray layer between the red layers. The red-mesoporous material is on the left in this view, with the touching dark-gray layer next and a lighter-gray material on the right as seen in a photograph of the same chip (right hand image in Fig. ( 32 )). The gray layer in con- tact with the red layer has the XEDS spectrum shown in Fig. ( 33 ) in which iron is not seen, while the outer gray material had an XEDS spectrum just like those displayed in Fig. ( 6 ). Thus, the middle-layer gray material contains carbon and oxygen and presumably also contains hydrogen, too light to be seen using this method. Since the gray inner layer appears between two other layers, it may be a type of adhesive, bind- ing a red porous thermitic material to another, iron-rich ma- terial. One might speculate that the red thermitic material has been attached to rusty iron by an adhesive. The cooling ef- fect of the iron in such close proximity, acting as a heat sink, might quench the reaction and explain the fact that unreacted red thermitic material, always found by us in thin layers, remains in the dust. These hypotheses invite further experi- ments. Fig. (32). Close-up SEM image of the chip pictured on the right, the same chip but not precisely the same spot.

XEDS spectrum for gray layer which touches the red layer of the chip shown above. No red/gray chips having the characteristics delineated here were found in dust generated by controlled demolition using conventional explosives and methods, for the Stardust Resort & Casino in Las Vegas (demolished 13 March 2007) and the Key Bank in Salt Lake City (demolished 18 August 2007). Of course, we do not assume that the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers occurred conventionally. The red material does burn quickly as shown in the DSC, and we have observed a bright flash on ignition, but determi- nation of the burn rate of the red material may help to classify this as a slow or fast explosive. It may be that this material is used not as a cutter-charge itself, but rather as a means to ig- nite high explosives, as in super-thermite matches [30]. Hav- ing observed unignited thermitic material in the WTC residue, we suggest that other energetic materials suitable for cutter charges or explosives should also be looked for in the WTC dust. NIST has admitted that they have not yet looked for such residues [11]. CONCLUSIONS We have discovered distinctive red/gray chips in signifi- cant numbers in dust associated with the World Trade Center destruction. We have applied SEM/XEDS and other methods to characterize the small-scale structure and chemical signa- ture of these chips, especially of their red component. The red material is most interesting and has the following charac- teristics: 1. It is composed of aluminum, iron, oxygen, silicon and carbon. Lesser amounts of other potentially reactive elements are sometimes present, such as potassium, sulfur, lead, barium and copper. 2. The primary elements (Al, Fe, O, Si, C) are typically all present in particles at the scale of tens to hundreds of nanometers, and detailed XEDS mapping shows intimate mixing. 3. On treatment with methyl ethyl ketone solvent, some segregation of components occurred. Elemental alu- minum became sufficiently concentrated to be clearly identified in the pre-ignition material. 4. Iron oxide appears in faceted grains roughly 100 nm across whereas the aluminum appears in thin plate- like structures. The small size of the iron oxide parti- cles qualifies the material to be characterized as nano- thermite or super-thermite. 5. Analysis shows that iron and oxygen are present in a ratio consistent with Fe 2 O 3 . The red material in all four WTC dust samples was similar in this way. Iron oxide was found in the pre-ignition material whereas elemental iron was not. 6. From the presence of elemental aluminum and iron oxide in the red material, we conclude that it contains the ingredients of thermite. 7. As measured using DSC, the material ignites and re- acts vigorously at a temperature of approximately 430 ̊ C, with a rather narrow exotherm, matching fairly closely an independent observation on a known super-thermite sample. The low temperature of igni- tion and the presence of iron oxide grains less than 120 nm show that the material is not conventional thermite (which ignites at temperatures above 900 ̊ C) but very likely a form of super-thermite. 8. After igniting several red/gray chips in a DSC run to 700 ̊ C, we found numerous iron-rich spheres and spheroids in the residue, indicating that a very high- temperature reaction had occurred, since the iron-rich product clearly must have been molten to form these shapes. In several spheres, elemental iron was veri- fied since the iron content significantly exceeded the oxygen content. We conclude that a high-temperature reduction-oxidation reaction has occurred in the heated chips, namely, the thermite reaction. 9. The spheroids produced by the DSC tests and by the flame test have an XEDS signature (Al, Fe, O, Si, C) which is depleted in carbon and aluminum relative to the original red material. This chemical signature strikingly matches the chemical signature of the sphe- roids produced by igniting commercial thermite, and also matches the signatures of many of the micro- spheres found in the WTC dust [5]. 10. The carbon content of the red material indicates that an organic substance is present. This would be ex- pected for super-thermite formulations in order to produce high gas pressures upon ign ition and thus make them explosive. The nature of the organic mate- rial in these chips merits further exploration. We note that it is likely also an energetic material, in that the total energy release sometimes observed in DSC tests exceeds the theoretical maximum energy of the clas- sic thermite reaction. Based on these observations, we conclude that the red layer of the red/gray chips we have discovered in the WTC dust is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporating nanotechnology, and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material. \u0002\u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u000b\f \r \u000e"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"30 The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Volume 2 Harrit et al.
