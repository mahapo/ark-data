    "pageContent": " 6 INTRODUCTION The New World Order system of world conquest has always been visible, but it is so hulking and massive that it has remain ed hidden in plain sight. One of the most common pre-conditioned responses I hear from the average compartmentalized individual is that there co uldn’t be a society of people working for world government. Those in denial procla im, “It’s too big...it would unravel...they couldn’t keep it hidden...” The average person judges the world according to their moral compass. Because most individuals are not ruthless, so ciopathic control-freaks, they cannot even begin to fathom the dark gulfs that are the souls of the servants of the global elite. The New World Order is a synthesis of the survivors of empires, of super-merchant families, of barbarian kings, of banking families established in the middle-ages, and of the royal families of Europe. Over time, they have learned that if they can simply conceal the true magnitude of their power and install puppet rulers from the cultures they dominate, the people will accept greater forms of tyranny. In the late 20 th Century, as the formation of a true world government entered its final stages, the globalists began to do what was unthinkable just a few years before. They began to admit that there really was a move towards a New World Order, complete with a World Court, World Taxes and a World Ar my to enforce its despotic laws. Just a few years ago, the average man on the st reet refused to even admit the possibility of a world government. Now that same individual will bellow, “Yes, there’s a world government – and we need it to protect ourselves from terrorism!” The globalists’ plan is so far along that now they must admit that world government is a reality. Their propagandists are hailing the New World Order as the only system that will keep us safe and secure. In reality, it is the world government itsel f which is conducting the terrorist acts. I can think of no better way to introduce th is book than with a collection of quotes by members of the global elite touti ng this dehumanizing system. "

Countless people – will hate the New World Order – and will die protesting against it.

This collec tion of power-mad megalomaniacs has been engineering a successive string of terroris t events to usher in a corrupt world government—a world government where, public documents show, populations will be herded into compact cities, issued nati onal ID cards, and even given implantable microchips. In this book we are first going to look at some historical examples of tyrants and governments—oligarchies alike—using disaster s (in many cases terrorist events that these tyrants themselves perpetrate against their populations and bureaucracies) to create a crisis in order to convince the people to exchange liberty for so-called security. We will start our analysis of the use of the Hegelian dialectic of problem-reaction- solution by looking at some historical exam ples, going back to Nero, who burned Rome, then blamed the fire on the Christians. We w ill then fast-forward to Adolph Hitler, who burned the Reichstag (the German Capitol Bu ilding Complex) shortly after being elected so that he could blame its destruction on the Nazis’ political enemies. He did this in order to destroy the German bill of rights and constitution, using the crisis to declare martial law in the Reich. Turning next to the Northwoods document from 1962, we will examine how the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ma ny other sectors of the federal government, up to the highest levels, were planning to blow up airliners full of American citizens as a pretext for war."

The FBI was caught on vi deo and audiotape by their informants admitting to helping arrange the bombing of the World Trade Center complex in order to get their Police State agenda through. Then, of course, in 1995 there was the Oklahoma City bombing. There are staggering amounts of evidence which we will cover in this book proving the fact that the government ha d prior knowledge and was instrumental in engineering the attacks on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Of course, none of you have to be reminded of the tragic events in 2001 on September 11. My friends, the government didn’t just have prior knowledge of the September 11 Al-Qaeda attacks. They actually funded, traine d, protected, coddled, and shepherded Al- Qaeda into this country. The shadow government trained many of the terrorists at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida.

Right after the attacks, Bush’s appr oval rating went from fo rty-five percent to ninety-plus percent. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, which effectively eviscerated the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, was passed, radically expanding the scope of the already colossal police state complex. Their cashless society, compact city, control grid is accelerating into place as Ameri cans scramble for “security.” The people were pre-conditioned be fore all of these attacks to give up their liberties so that the government could prot ect them from terrorists. Ho wever, we must look at who really stands to gain from these acts and at who has the motive. Take the case of the Oklahoma City Bombing. The government tr ipled the FBI’s anti- terrorism funding in 1996 after the attack, but, of course, more f unding and police powers in the hands of the Feds only insured that the next attack would be worse. Now the government is demanding even more power and funding. They didn’t protect us in 2001 from Al-Qaeda, did they? No, instead they funded and protected the terrorists. The US government has consistently created or exacerbated problems so the social engineers can call for more control. For ex ample, the government has been orchestrating the phony drug war for decades. Now there is triple the heroin and double the cocaine on our streets (Justice Department crime statistics) than th ere was eight years ago. Our prison population has gone from 1.3 million to 6.5 million in the last two years, with the numbers of Americans who are incarcerated ever increasing. Similarly, the globalists held a war on poverty, and now poverty and personal and corporate debt have only increased. The government had a fifty year program supposedly fighting illiteracy. Drops in children’s test scores ca n be tracked to uniformly follow the level of government involvement -- the more government i nvolvement, the lower the test scores. Now the government is stepping up their “w ar against terrorism.” As this “war” progresses, you are only going to see escalati ons in terrorist acts, because after each horrible event the government gets more power , more control over our lives, and more funding.

Already the states admit that they are implementing a national ID card scheme. And then there is the total goal, the reason the New World Order elites are pushing all of this. We know they want tyranny. We know th is global government is behind it. (They are now publicly talking about a New World Order.) How did they get all this power? And what is their final goal? Their goal is a world populati on reduction of eighty percen t with everyone crammed into compact cities. The United Nations is preparing to release mass plagues on the earth because the elite forces want to extend thei r lives with life extension technology while culling the “human herd” down to a “manageable level.” They know that technology is a double-edged sword. It can be used to empowe r humanity, but it can also be used to totally enslave humanity. They know they are in a race against time and their window of opportunity is closing. They must dehumanize us now -- they’ve got to enslave us here on the global plantation, or they are going to lose control. The New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals who are hell-bent on dehumanizing the entire populace. They are obsessed with total control. These megalomaniacal sadists are absolutely swor n to the creation of a worldwide tyranny called the New World Order. This is the evidence, and it is conclusive. Terror in History War.

If there isn’t an enemy to fight, one has to be manufactured. Here are some examples from history of dict ators using terrorism to get what they want: Nero and Rome In A . D . 64, on the tenth of August, Nero, the emperor of Rome, set the city ablaze while he fiddled. You see, he had a problem: the Ch ristians were getting too popular. So Nero torched Rome and blamed it on the Christians. After this manufactur ed crisis, the people were more than happy to put the Christians into the arena and to cheer as they were torn them limb from limb. This persecution of the Christians is only one of many ancient examples of governments persecuting gr oups of people afte r creating crises. The Maine and the Lusitania On February 15, 1898, William McKinley’s navy committed treason when it blew up its own ship in Havana Harbor to create a pret ext for war with the Spanish government. Simply by blowing up this ship, the Maine, the United States was able to finally dominate the Western Hemisphere and take control of do zens of islands in the Pacific. Then in World War I, when the American population was reluctant to enter the European conflict, the British sailed one of their largest naval auxiliary ships, the Lusitania, through waters known to be heavily patrolled by German U- boats. The Germans ran multiple full-page warnings in the New York Times, telling Ameri cans not to travel on this ship which they knew to be heavily laden with armaments de stined for the trenches. When German torpedoes sunk the Lusitania, Americans were faced with casualty lists of their dead countrymen and finally succumbed to war-fever. Hitler’s Reichstag "

Adolph Hitler had already been elected pr esident, but he wanted to abolish the chancellery and to make himself Führer. To do that, he had to create enough of a crisis to create massive levels of fear in the populati on so that they would willingly lay down their republic and give it into the ha nds of his monstrous system. Historical documents from Nazi archives show that on the night of February 27, 1933, Adolph Hitler’s Stormtroopers burned the Re ichstag government building to the ground. A wave of arrests then took place across the Re ich as the Führer told the people that he would protect them and that they would ha ve a Utopian world. Everything would be given to them by the state, as long as they o ffered total fealty and support of their Führer. The people bought Hitler’s promise of a Ut opia . . . and were totally enslaved. Hitler had used the alchemy of dictators: the Hegelian dialectic of problem-reaction- solution. Attack yourself, blame your enemies, and tell the public you can protect them if they give up their freedoms. FDR and Pearl Harbor On December 8, 1941, after the Japanese att ack on Pearl Harbor, the following words were broadcast across the United States by US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. “Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenl y and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.” It may have been a surprise attack to the American people, but it wasn’t to the federal government and the military. Months before the attack, they knew the Japanese were preparing for an all-out a ssault in the Pacific.

Roosevelt had campaigned to keep America out of the war, but his backers had been funding the Japanese war machine for years. They had also been financing and encouraging Hitler’s blitzkrieg. The Anglo-American establishment based in New York and London needed a global crisis to bring in a global government and th e birth of the United Na tions. That’s why six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt had the naval command remove the code-breaking machines from P earl Harbor, as well as dismantle the radar. They had to have the crisis to justify the crea tion of this global system of tyranny. Think of the dastardly deed the White House had committed, leaving our troops, our sailors, our boys to die. The global elite had at tempted to create a League of Nations at the end of World War I. When it failed, World War II had to be bigger, on a larger scale, so the people would say, “Give us a global gove rnment to protect us from these horrible wars.” "

Kennedy broadcast these words on October 22, 1962: “Good evening, my fellow citizens. This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned islan d. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.” In the early 1960s, the federal government needed an excuse, a pretext, to invade Cuba. The government actually put the plan to pa per in the notorious Operation Northwoods document. The story was first reported in James Bamford’s Book, Body of Secrets and carried in published medi a reports on ABC News ( ABC News , May 1, 2001: “Friendly Fire: U.S. Military Drafted Plans to Terrori ze U.S. Cities to Provoke War with Cuba”) as well as in the Baltimore Sun ( Baltimore Sun , April 24, 2001: “New book on NSA sheds light on secrets: U.S. terror plan called Cuba invasion pretext”). In the Operation Northwoods document, the federal government proposed blowing up airliners full of Americans, saying: “Casua lty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of indignation.” The madman, the architect of this plan, was General L. L. Lemnitzer, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. He got his Faustian plan approved all the way up to the Secretary of Defense. President Kennedy was not amused. NOTE TO PUBLISHER – INSERT IMAGES 4-6 4.

In another part of the plan, just as the U.S.S. Maine was sunk as a pretext for entry into the Span ish-American War, it was suggested that the Navy could blow up one of its own ships. The whole document is an insane testament to the effectiveness of the cold-blooded use of problem/reaction/solution. The document details how the Hegelian dialec tic could be made to work in order to motivate the American people to get behind the government ’s push for a war, in this case a nuclear war with Cuba and the Soviet Union. It’s hard for any decent person to be able to wrap their mind around the thought processes that the controllers are/were using. You mu st understand that they are after raw power and that history has shown that there is no better way to seize power, expand power and maintain power than through controlled crises that harness the militant tribal enthusiasm of the howling mob. President Kennedy had always b een a servant of the elite, bu t he was so shocked by the Operation Northwoods document that he signed Executive Order 11110 shortly before his death announcing that he w ould abolish the Federal Reserv e System.

    "pageContent": " 20 The Federal government had their eye on the Wo rld Trade Center complex as a target for a manufactured crisis since at least the early 1990’s. Th is time the problem-reaction- solution system was to be activated not ag ainst some foreign enemy, but against the American population’s sense of security as a pretext to expand the pow ers of the security and intelligence agencies inside the US. The October 28, 1993, edition of the New York Times ran an article headlined, “Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast” (see also October 31, 1993, New York Times ; Chicago Tribune , December 15, 1993: “Informants’ Recordings Show FBI Had Prior Knowledge of the Bomb ing”). The federal government was caught on tape by their informants ordering them to let the bombing go forward, to cook the bomb, to give the terrorists the detonators, to create yet another crisis . . . this time to usher in a police state and a war upon the American people. Unlike the Operation Northwoods plan, the FB I actually carried out the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. They hired a re tired 43-year-old former Egyptian army officer, Emad Salem, paid him $1,000,000 and gave him real explosives and a detonator. They told him to build the bomb and to gi ve it to the foolish people that he was controlling in order to allow them to attack the World Trade Center complex. There was a major problem with their pl an: Mr. Salem was not as ruthless and sociopathic as the FBI and its globalist contro llers. He began to get very concerned right before the attack, asking himself why he was be ing giving real explosives if this were to be just a “sting operation.” When he was to ld to let the attack go forward, Mr. Salem secretly recorded John Anticev, head of the New York office of the FBI, ordering him to let the bombing take place. The World Trade Center bombing of 1993 is just one of many stories consisting of government-sponsored terrorism that has been swept under the rug. One of the spin masters’ favorite tools is to underreport stories of earth -shattering importance while magnifying stories of little or no significance to mammoth proportions."

One main problem with thei r plan: the drivers of the truck didn’t park it against the main support column as they had been ordered to do by Mr. Salem and the FBI. Instead they parked it about a dozen feet away, and so it didn’t bring down the building. Consequently, the Federal Governme nt didn’t get the massive death toll it needed to create the martial law system it was hell-bent on implementing against our Constitutional Republic. To the horror of the American people, the Feds finished the job on September 11, 2001. Oklahoma City Bombing April 19, 1995. Multiple bombs ripped through the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. As usual, Federal fi ngerprints were all over this tragic event. President Bill Clinton, taking his orders from the New World Order chieftains, needed a crisis to get his plans for a socialized America and gun c ontrol agenda through. Taking a page out of history’s handbook , Bill Clinton knew that a crisis of this magnitude, including endless images of mangled child ren would pull on the heartstrings of Americans. They would beg for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S.735) that he had failed to pass just a year before. The bill absolutely eviscerated massive sections of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. We have been investigating the Oklahoma C ity tragedy for over six years and the amount of evidence is staggering. Let’s ju st hit some of the key points: Oklahoma City’s NBC affiliate, KFOR, in a live broadcast immediately after the bombing, reported: "

The first bomb that was in the Federal Building did go off. It did the damage that you see right there. The second explosive was found and defused. The third explosive that was found—and they are working on right now as we speak, I understand— both the second and third explosives—if you can imagine this—were larger than the first. So try to im agine two or threefold happening what we’ve already seen there. It is just incredible to think that there was that much heavy artillery that was somehow moved into the downtown Oklahoma City Federal Building.” A few minutes later, Oklahoma City CBS af filiate KWTV’s Jennifer Reynolds had the following to add: “We just saw, if you were watching, there was a white pickup truck backing a trailer into the scene. They are trying to move people out of the way so they can get it in. It appe ars to be the Oklahoma City bomb squad—their bomb disposal unit essentia lly is what it is—and it is what they would use if the report that we gave you just a few moments ago turns out to be correct, that they ha ve found a second explosive device of some kind inside that building. They will back that trailer down there, and the bomb squad folks will go in and they will use that trailer. . . . This is how they would transport the explosiv e device away from this populated area to try to do something with it.” At the same time, CNN reported: “The Justice Department is reporti ng that a second explosive device has been found in the A.P.

It was an explosion at 9:00 this morning that did that damage you’re look at right there—blowing off the entire north face of that building. Again, you’re looking at the north face. A second bo mb was found on the east side of that building. A bomb squad is on the scene. That second bomb has not exploded. We don’t know quite the status yet—if they have managed to defuse it—but it has been confirmed that a second bomb has been found on the east side.” Oklahoma governor Frank Keating, on th e telephone with reporters, said: “The report that I have is that one device was deactivated. Apparently there is another device, and obviously whatever did the damage to the Murrah Building was a tremendous, very sophisticated explosive device.” KFOR also reported: “President Clinton just called Governor Frank Keating. He says that three FBI anti-terrorist teams are en route to Oklahoma City right now. They are saying that this is the work of a sophisticated group. This is a very sophisticated device and it has to have been done by an explosives expert, obviously with this type of explosion.” "

I see another bomb truck going, so apparently they are going to try to get out that third bomb that’s been talked about. Still a lot of activity around the Murrah Building . . . security concerns that another one could go off.” KFOR also reported: “Fortunately, it didn’t, because the second device that they found, we understand, was even more powerful than the first. They then found a third device. You can see the look on this woman’s face—the fear that she might have to go through the same thing again. They then found a third device, which was also larger than the first. Hard to feel lucky at this point, but certainly through some goo d work by some munitions experts and the explosive sniffing dogs, furthe r tragedy has certainly been averted here.” Terrorism expert Dr. Randall H earther had this to say: “It was a great stroke of luck that we have actually got defused bombs. It’s through the bomb material that we will be able to track down who committed this atrocity.” "

Unfortunately the BATF agents, acco rding to police and firefighter testimony, were inside removing them and spiriting them away, because they had to keep their story straight (that there was only one bomb, a truck bomb). Out of hundreds of people we interviewed, we couldn’t find a single person who said they’d only heard one explosion. One witness, Charles Williams, who worked in downtown Oklahoma City at the time of the bombing, said unequivocally that he felt two blasts very close together. It is historical fact, part of the public reco rd, that there were multiple devices inside the Oklahoma City building and that there were at least two explosions. The emergency radio transmission transcripts show clearly that the police and firefighter s witnessed the BATF removing unexploded devices. We also have the scientific evidence. The University of Oklahoma’s own seismographic reports, as well as the U.S. Geological Su rvey reports—two different scientific institutions—show multiple explosions. But fo r there to have been multiple explosions, Timothy McVeigh would have had to have accompli ces . . . and that didn’t fit in with the federal story, especially if th e reality showed that it had to be a group that had access to a federal building for long, extended periods of time, like the BATF and the FBI. General Benton K. Partin, former head of Air Force Weapons Development with thirty- plus years running the Air Force Weapons Development Program, has multiple engineering degrees. General Partin was amazed by press reports claiming that the building had been blown in and that a truck bomb could cause that damage, when even a basic understanding of explosive signatures sh ows that the building was blown not from the outside in, but from the inside out. Within days of the blast, General Partin wa s on the scene. He was, of course, barred access. Thankfully, from video as well as photographs of the columns, it was obvious to his trained eye that the columns had been bl own off by shaped charges. In a detailed report, the former head of Air Force Wea pons Development laid out the physics, the"

In his report, he stated that it was a physi cal impossibility that a truck bomb—even made with military-grade explosives—could even begin to generate the explosive force that was brought agai nst the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Now the seismographs come in. The seismogra phs first registered one distinct explosion, and then a group of explosions so close to each other that they could not be separated. You see, the Feds had to have a diversionary blast. They had to be able to tell the world that it was one lone nut—Timothy McVeigh— out front. They need ed McVeigh’s truck bomb outside so that they could cover the fact that there were actually explosives inside the structure. If you look at the actual crat er that the supposed truck bomb generated, it was so small that it could hardly be meas ured. However,in later media reports that explosion grew bigger and bigger and bigger ( Newsweek, May 1, 1995). Another key piece of evidence that General Partin raised was that a single bomb explosion could not account for the failure of co lumns that were farther away at the back of the building compared to the non-failure of columns that were much closer to the supposed truck bomb blast. He concluded that the asymmetrical nature of the damage to the Murrah Building was one indication that shaped demolition charges were used in the bombing. In modern history, thousands of buildings of every type and design have been destroyed commercially to make way for new structures. But that didn’t matter to the BATF, the federal government, or the media. They tu rned structural engineering on its head, demanding and telling the world that a single truck bomb actually did this damage, even though the blast’s signature clea rly showed that the building had been blown out, not in. Not only was the scientific and engineering wo rld shocked with disbelief, but the general public wasn’t buying the story either. They ha d seen what had happened.

Witness: ‘I asked him if his office was in the building, and he said yes. And I asked if there were any ATF agen ts still in the building and he said, “No we weren’t here.” Reporter: Witness #1 approached an ATF agent nearby. He claims he asked the agent what had happened and Witness #1 said this is what the agent told him: "

Why wasn’t anybody else? There was a lo t of people, good people, died down there, and if they knew, they s hould have let everybody else know.’” Oklahoma City paramedic Tiffany Bible, who heroically responded with her unit just minutes after the blast on April 19, 1995, swore in an affidavit that when she arrived the BATF was in full mock gear. Bomb gear ta kes at least thirty minutes to put on. When she asked them, “Oh my goodness, were you guys hurt inside the blast?” they said, “No, we got tipped off by our pagers not to come in today.” Linda Cavanaugh, a reporter for KFOR News, reported: “Were agents forewarned about a bomb in Oklahoma City? Did they know the Murrah Building was a target? Th e ATF says no, absolutely not. But tonight in a story you will see only on the NewsChannel, you are about hear otherwise from people who were at the Murrah Building that morning.

KFOR had this to report following the Oklahoma City bombing: “$62 million is coming to Okla homa soon to help anti-terrorism and disaster relief efforts.” That’s right, the BATF locally got tens of millions of dollars in extra funding. So did every ot her controlling federal agency. Increases in Federal funding to the State of Oklahoma in 1996: • $23.52 million—General Services Admi nistration, Counter-terrorism Fund salaries and expenses • $27.94 million—FBI salaries and expenses • $3.27 million—FEMA’s Disaster Relief Emergency Contingency Fund. There was a $24 billion increase in anti-te rrorism funds, which was tripled after September 11. Of course, the BATF ensured that the Murrah building was completely demolished so there couldn’t be any evidence of their heinous acts. And—that’s right— they actually buried the building under guard at a private landfill with Wackenhut guards protecting it. From A to Z, there are federal fingerprints all over the Oklahoma City Bombing, and the government is doing everything it can to suppress the truth.

Now we can see a new world coming into being, a world in which there is the very re al prospect of a new world order.” —President George Bush, State of the Union Address, September 11, 1991 The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—an organization publicly sworn to destroy American national sovereignty and to ushe r in a tyrannical police state—could not contain its glee on September 14, just days af ter the tragic attack, when its members announced their New World Order. At a mee ting broadcast on C-Span, Gary Hart, co- chair of the U.S. Commission on National Securi ty in the 21st Century, stated: “There is a chance for the president of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father only used once, a nd it hasn’t been used since—and that is a New World Order.” There it is. The CFR actually admitted that th is crisis was helping it to bring in a New World Order, a global government. Now let’s ex amine how the globalists plan to get that job done. "

Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with Da vid Rockefeller and other luminaries of the global system, actuall y bragged in his 1998 book The Grand Chessboard, of how America would be attacked by Afghan terrorists. A war for global government would then take place in Central Asia that would be used as a reason to roll out national ID cards and a global police state here in the United States. According to Brzezinski’s book, everything that is happening now was planned decades ago. Brzezinski’s book continues to explain how America must survive by following the basic rules of empire and how outside enemies ar e needed to mobilize the population behind the imperium ’s hegemony. In The Grand Chessboard Brzezinski writes: \"...To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostr ategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.\" (p.40) - \"Moreover, as America becomes an increa singly multi-cultural society, it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on fore ign policy issues, except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceive d direct external threat.\" (p. 211) - \"The attitude of the Ameri can public toward the external projection of American power has been much more ambivalent. The public supported America's engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. (pp 24- 5) "

    "pageContent": " 41 The relationship between the CIA and the Afghan freedom fighters, the Mujhadeen, predates Ronald Reagan. The bonds of rapport there with the Centra l Intelligence Agency led to the creation of their super-asset: Os ama bin Laden, the rich Saudi Arabian sheik whose family to this day builds most Unite d States military bases in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. It is on the record that bin Laden is a CIA asset (see MSNBC article, “Bin Laden comes home to roost: His CIA ties are only the beginning of a woeful story,” by Michael Moran). So, every time an American president needs a distraction overseas, a ship or an em bassy gets blown up. On October 12, 2000, the U.S.S. Cole, while docked at the port of Aden in Ye men, was attacked. Seventeen Americans were killed, and thirty-nine wounded—sacrific ed yet again on the altar of globalism. For examples of this, look at Bill Clinton’ s Presidency. Every time Bill Clinton was in trouble an embassy, a ship, a barracks would suddenly blow up, just like the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The CIA asset bi n Laden was delivering time and time again, and Bill Clinton was there, protecting him, re fusing to take files from foreign countries like Sudan, Iraq, and Afghanistan that indica ted where Al-Qaeda was in the world, where they were active -- even in the continental United States. Sudan offered to arrest bin Laden on three separate occasions. Bill Clint on answered by bombing, with state-of-the- art cruise missiles, their only pharmaceutical plant, denying Africa desperately needed medicines ( Los Angeles Times , December 5, 2001: “Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize”; London Times, January 6, 2002, “US Missed Three Chances to Seize Bin Laden”; Worldnetdaily, October 31, 2001, “Was C linton pro-Taliban?”; The Village Voice, October 31, 2001, “Thanks, But No Thanks—How the U.S. Missed a Chance to Get Bin Laden). In reality the New World Order scheme is a lot bigger than just Republicans or Democrats. The truth is that the Central In telligence Agency, controlled by Wall Street, has been grooming Bin Laden and his family over the last fifty years to carry out dangerous projects in the Middle East, Cent ral Asia, and North Africa. Back in 1996, according to the Times of India, the CIA worked in tandem with Pakistan to create the Taliban ( Times of India , March 7, 2001: “CIA Worked in Tandem with Pak to Create"

They needed this bogeyman for one more big action ( Washington Post, October 29, 2001: “Diplomats Met with Taliban on Bin Laden—Some Content U.S. Missed Chance”). Through all of this, Bin Laden’s family was being rewarded with giant satell ite company deals, oil company mergers, and some of the biggest construction projects in the world. Gary Hart, at the CFR mee ting mentioned earlier, said: “There is a new world coming. Am erica will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland, and our military superiority will not entirely protect us. American s will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.” So, bin Laden in a known CIA asset that the New World Order has used time and time again to further its agenda. No matter what corner of the September 11 tragedy you look into, you will always find government invol vement. Here, broken down for you, are just some of the many facts that prove that Se ptember 11 was part of a larger globalist program. CIA Meeting with Bin Laden in July 2001 Shortly after September 11, witnesses came fo rward documenting for the record the fact that bin Laden met with the CIA Section Chief for ten days in Dubai in the American hospital. French intelligence was so upset by what they had learned that they purposely published media reports prior to September 11 specifically warning that bin Laden was planning to hijack aircraft and fly them in to tall buildings in downtown Manhattan as well as the Pentagon ( This Is London, October 31, 2001: “CIA agent ‘met Bin Laden in July’; Ananova , October 31, 2001, “Bin Laden 'met CIA agent before terror attacks”; Le Figaro , October 31, 2001, “La CIA aurait rencontré Ben Laden en juillet”).

Newsweek ran the headline, “The Hijackers We Let Escape,” reporting the fact that the CIA followed these two men into Malaysia where they had a meeting with seni or leaders of the Al-Qaeda in 2000. The CIA flew out of Los Angeles closely tracking Al-Qaeda-Pakistani Intelligence useful idiots Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid Almihdhar. Both men attended what the FBI called an Al-Qaeda summit. The American people were shocke d to learn that the CIA had been following the hijackers for four years. Even after th eir meeting in 2000 with the leadership of the Al-Qaeda, Alhazmi and Almihdhar were allowed to return to the United States and to enroll in flight schools. Reports in the BBC and the Washington Times confirmed that the CIA had pressured US Embassies abroad and the INS to issue visas for all 19 of the hijackers ( Newsnight , November 6, 2001, “Has Someone Been Sitting on the FBI?”). Pengtagon Mass Casualty Exercise Even before July 2001, the government had received multiple warnings. The military district of Washington, D.C. t ook the warnings of the plans to fly hijacked passenger jets into New York and Washington, D.C. landmarks seriously. The Army’s online news service reported in its N ovember 3, 2000 edition that the Pentagon conducted a mass casualty exercise simulating a terrorist at tack on the Pentagon building by a suicide hijacker flying a large passenge r jet. Despite this publicly available record, a Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee conducted a top to bottom whitewash concerning government prior knowledge The committee found that the government had never even considered the possibility of hijacked airliners being flown into buildings. Of course, the Pentagon and the Defense Department didn’t need to be warned. The first media reports that came out said that five of the hijackers had been trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station ( Newsweek, September 15, 2001, “Alleged Hijackers May Have Trained at U.S. Bases” ). Later reports from the Pensacola News Journal, in an article headlined “Pensacola NAS links faces more scrutiny,” confirmed that three of the hijackers had been trained there two y ears before the September 11 attack.

FBI Deputy Director John O’Neill’s Untimely Demise We have already talked about FBI Deputy Di rector John O’Neill quitting because George Bush signed the order forbidding him to stop Al-Qaeda. The reason for his not going public now? Mr. O’Neill is dead.

There were other witnesses: former military munitions experts and police officers, as well as structural engineers who ma de similar observations.

Judicial Watch also questioned why th e FBI, that had threatened Robert Wright and many other agents, was so supportive of FBI Agent Coleen Rowley, who had come forward with peripheral information about pr ior knowledge. The reason the FBI did this was because they were desperate to have th e appearance that they were not engaging in a cover-up, and Coleen Rowley, in her now-fam ous memo, was stating that she had been blocked from going after the hijackers, but that it was just a bureaucratic snafu, and that the government just needed more funding.

Bush at the Pentagon Memorial: “The hijackers were instruments of ev il who died in vain. Behind them is a dark cult of evil who seeks to ha rm the innocent and thrives on human suffering. Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty—the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears. Theirs is the wo rst kind of violence! Pure malice while daring to claim the authority of God. We cannot fu lly understand the designs and power of evil. It is enough to know that evil—like goodness— exists. And in the terrorists evil has found a willing servant.” "

Following is a transcript of an exclusiv e interview with David Schippers from my syndicated radio broadcast, The Alex Jones Show: DS: I began to get information concerning a Middle Eastern connection to Oklahoma City AJ: We’ve had Colonel Craig Robert s, who was a detective working the case, on this show many times—a month before the attack predicting that one was imminent. He has all that same information. They actually arrest ed some of these guys and the Justice Department in ’9 5 said, “Release them.” DS: That’s right. And the word’s out even today that they—the Oklahoma City Police—are not a llowed to touch them. And again, from what I’m understanding, they are up to something again in Oklahoma City. I don’t know what it is or what their target it, but these same people are at it again. AJ: Now later, you got it from FBI agents in Chicago and Minnesota that there was going to be an attack on lower Manhattan. DS: Yeah, that’s what started me calling. First of all, I tried to see if I could get a congressman to go to bat for them, and at least bring these people out there and listen to them. I sent them information and nobody cared. It was always, “We’ll get back to you.” Then I reached out and tried to get to the attorney-general when finally we got an attorney-general in there th at I would be willing to talk to.

He said, “You know, we don’t start our investigations at th e top.” I said, “I’d like to talk to the attorney-general because th is is vital.” He said, “We don’t start our investigations at the top. Let me look into this and I’ll get back to you.” Well, as I sit here today, I’ve never heard back from him. AJ: Again, David Schippers, you’re bi g in Washington. You were the top lawyer who got Clinton impeached. You are highly respected. You know the senators, the congressmen. You’re calling up. You’ve got these FBI agents and others feeding you this information. They are being pulled off the cases. They are angry. That’s even been in the news in Minnesota and Illinois. They know what is going to happen. The Sudanese in ’96 and ’98 tried to arrest bin Laden for Clinton, trie d to give us the names of Al- Qaeda. Clinton wouldn’t take it. DS: He didn’t want any part of it. AJ: Wouldn’t touch it. So we’ve got all of this developing. We’ve got police officers and FBI on th e ground who know who bombed Oklahoma City. They’ve got them in custody with blue jogging suits and bomb-making components. They are ordered to release them. All of this is unfol ding. 3,500 to 5,000 Iraqi Republican Guard.

In 2000, US intelligence agencies aided General Mush arraf in a successful coup. In late 2001, Pakistani intelligence, using US aircraft, ai rlifted 6,000 taliban and al-Qaeda leaders to safety out of Afghanistan ( MSNBC , November 29, 2001, “Airlift of Evil”; The New Yorker , January 21, 2002, “The Getaway”; The Times , January 21, 2002, “US Let Taleban Men Escape”). In the summer of 2001, Pakistani ISI chief, Ge neral Ahmed, ordered an aide to wire- transfer $100,000 to Mohammed Atta, who, according to the Federal Government, was the head terrorist in the suicide hijackings.

Months later, in July 2002, these same Congressmen on the Joint Intelligence Co mmittee feigned ignorance and conducted a shameless Warren Commission-style whitewash of the government prior knowledge story. It is important to note that the government prior knowledge st ory that dominated the front pages of newspapers in May of 2002 was in itself a distraction.

Ari Fleischer and Condoleeza Rice, and even Bush gave speeches admitting that mistakes were made, but “it was all accidental. They just missed the clues...and if the people would just give up their liberties the security forces would be more than happy to ensure their safety.” The problem wasn’t that the CIA had founded, funded and shepherded the radical Islamic brigades, nor was it that they were using these groups to de stabilize Arab countries as a type of super-provocateur core , it was that the tripling of the anti-terrorism budget in 1996 wasn’t enough.

The Motive In order to be able to profile the elite and to understand what their plans are for the future, it is integral to refocus on their mo tive in carrying out their September 11 th operation. The illuminati and its allied organizations, which represent the dominant power cartels of the world, are threatened by sovereign nati ons. They view sovereign nations as populations of human beings th at are not under their control. The term that the New World Order mouthpiece media uses for sove reign nations is “rogue states.” By carrying out September 11 th , the globalists created a tailor- made excuse to invade and subjugate sovereign nations simply by labeling them as “those that harbor terrorists.” They created a situation to get the people li ving in the heart of the empire to support endless wars of aggression.

Out of the legion of reasons that the New World Order launched that attack the two biggest are: ushe ring in an Orwellian police state that would make the “Ministry of Love” feel second string, and the fuelling a worldwide neo- imperial hyper-tyranny where the indi vidual is completely dehumanized. Putin Uses Terror Back in 1999 Vladymir Putin was a rising young star in Russia who had just stepped down from his position of KGB (now known as the Federal Security Bureau (FSB) Section Chief of Saint Petersburg. Putin was Boris Yeltsin’s top deputy, and he had a problem on his hands. How was he going to get into office when the polls showed the people didn’t want him? Simple. Putin used the Hegelian dialectic. His secret police were caught blowing up three separate apartm ent buildings. Moscow police arrested his agents in an apartment building placing hexa gen, a highly explosive plastique. Now, in 2002, members of the FSB have gone public with the information, as well as explosives experts and Vladimir Putin’s form er associate, Boris Berezovsky ( The Guardian , March 6, 2002, “Former ally links Putin to Moscow blasts”; Moscow Times, March 6, 2002, “Berezovsky Says Putin Knew About FSB Rol e”). After Berezovsky reported that the government was behind the bombing, Putin ordered his media empire seized. Back in 1999, desperate to apprehend whoeve r was responsible for the deadly bombings of three apartment buildings in which 350 people had died, Moscow police caught three members of the FSB in the act of planting bombs in a fourth apartment building.

We interviewed the commander of the Marines and he admitted they were doing house-to-house searches with volunteers for weapons sweeps. When we talked to Marines on the ground, they admitted this was for a domestic takeover, to fight domestic insurgents. How do you feel about the military patrolli ng America? Taking over the City Council? Taking over the Town Hall? Working with the local police? Wide-awake Americans realize that this is all part of a process to integrate the public into the new homeland security police state. The Army teams descending on America’s cities have an obsession with the youth. They coordinated large gangs of young children to rove around day a nd night on their bicycles, reporting intelligence about citizens in Hebr on, Maryland to Marine Corps officers in plain clothes. There were also hundreds of active duty military marching around in plain clothes directing the civilian police. "

An article from Reuters, February 16, 2002, was headlined “Marines to Practice Urban War in Real City.” This article details how Marines are occupying multiple cities in the continental United States, and that they ar e engaging in strategic deception against the population. Jenny Holbert, the Marine Corps war fighting spokesperson, told the public, “Oh, this is the first time we’ve done someth ing like this. It’s very unusual. We’ve never been in an American city. We’ve never done urban warfare training in an American city before.” The above statement is an out a nd out lie counting on the ignorance of the reporter.

There is also the Emergency Health Powers Act whic h allows the government to force entire towns into sports stadiums or aircraft hangers and authorizes troops to “shoot a grandmother” if ordered to do so ( Detroit Free Press Washington, November 7, 2001, “Vast quarantine role advocated for states”). Concerning the passage of the Model States Emergency Health Powers Act(MSEHPA) by many of the states, Joseph Farah, Director of the Western Journalism Center, wrote in a report for WorldNetDaily (June 21, 2002, “Fas cism at the Door”) that MSEHPA is a “nightmarish, Orwellian federal-state power grab.” Reporting on the text of the legislation, Farah writes, “It authorizes the \"control of property\" – a nice term for confiscation of everything, including – but not limited to – your house, your car, your guns, your food, your clothing and your fuel. It authorizes the management of people – meaning forced vaccinations, incarceration a nd restrictions on transportation. It also authorizes the government to se ize control of communications.” Most of the fifty states are passing the M odel States Emergency Health Powers Act as we write this book. It is an Adolph Hitler wish list that is quickly manifesting itself at every level of government. The plans talk about how to deal with the millions of dead bodies; how they are going to round us up; how they are going to herd us into compact cities (November 7, 2001 Detroit Free Press quotes the Federal head of MSEHPA detailing how they plan to use sport stadiums as detention camps); and how to use slave labor at the different federal camps, which they have already been doing si nce 1989 at twelve different Army bases – see the Army Civilian Inmate Labor Program.

Drills at Schools Across the country, SWAT teams are putting the finishing touches on our new prison- style schools, by conditioning our kids with “mock-terrorist/school shooting attacks.” SWAT teams’ so-called anti-terror drills at schools are really just conditioning exercises that are part of Federally-funded FEMA pr ograms to condition the children that it’s completely normal to have men dressed up like executioners screaming at them, taking over their schools without warrants, and orde ring them, with their hands behind their heads, onto busses where they are ta ken to undisclosed locations.

It has been confirmed that at least six of the thirteen were killed by the SW AT teams (AP, December 7, 2001, “Columbine Student Killed by Cop”; AP, December 8, 2001 “Rohrbough: Ballistics show police killed Daniel”). In terrorist drills, sadistic predators across the nation get to enjoy abusing and traumatizing children as young as six years of age. Men in black uniforms yell and scream and throw profanities at them (that we won’t print here) as they beg and cry and plead. They are then loaded on buses and ta ken to a local jail where they are dragged around like filth and treated like criminals. A whole generation is learning how to be slaves, learning how to bow down and beg and to put their hands behind their heads when the “ring wraiths,” the “dark lords” appear. The controlled news media claims that there is an epidemic of school violence. The fact is that more Americans die in football accidents in public schools than from gun shot wounds. Fifty-four children died in the year 2000 in high school football accidents. Fifty-two died in school shootings (s ource: Department of Justice). And many of these children died at the ha nds of SWAT teams. SWAT teams are notoriously trigger-happy and frequently s hoot their own officers. Take Fort Worth, Texas, where the “Cop of the Year” was shot in the head by one of his comrades at a SWAT team drill at a school. In Detroit, they shot a kid in the face in one of these so- called drills. Conditioning Through Media and Cartoons "

One cartoon, featuring the character Buzz Lightyear recently ran an episode where a delivery was being made to the superh ero’s home by a futuristic mailman. In this cartoon, the deliveryman used not only a retinal scan but also DNA to verify the identity of the recipient. If we were to show you a ll the evidence in children’s cartoons and media of face scanning, thumb scanning, national ID cards, and the overall police state, this book would be five hundred pages long. Let’s just look at the facts. Biometrics and the Cashless Society Washington, D.C., has already implemented a card—which is held with the CIA and the National Security Agency—for all children. It contains all kinds of biometric information -- face scans, thumb prints, you name it ( Washington Post, August 15, 2001, “DC Plans ID Card for Students”). If the childre n want their school lunches, they have to thumb scan to get them. No thumb scan, no food ( ABCNews.com, January 10, 2002, “Finger Food”; CBS News , January 24, 2002, “Fingerprint s Pay for School Lunch”). All this trains the children for the cashless society and gets them into the database. Think about it. Thumb scanning in government schools to get food. You would expect to read about something like this in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World or George Orwell’s 1984 , but it’s actually happening . . . and it’s only the beginning. It’s not just children who are being conditione d. Adults across the land are biometrically scanning to bank. And not just bank— but to get their lunches too, at Kroger and HEB food stores from Texas to New York. GPS Control Grid Now the Feds have expanded their tracking co ntrol grid by passing a law that all new cell phones, starting in October 2001, have to be sa tellite trackable so they know exactly where you’re at . . . for your safety ( www.bn.com, September 16, 1999, “Feds OK Cell"

The federal government is in talks with the states to force everyone to have an OnStar-type tracking system in their car for tracking as well as taxation purposes. Private companies are racing ahead to implement this Big Brother system. Rental car companies are imposing fines of $450 for going one mile over the speed limit ( ZDNet News, June 19, 2001, “Car spy pushes privacy limit”), and that’s if you pass the thumb scan to get the rental car ( Wired News , November 21, 2001, “No Thumprint, No Rental Car”). England, the United States, Canada and Aust ralia have published plans for a unified satellite tracking system to be in all cars by 2005. This system will tax and trace all drivers and turn your car off if you haven’ t been a “good globalist.” The Canadian newspaper, The National Post , on June 10, 2002, reported, “Transport Canada wants to make global positioning systems and igniti on immobilizers standard issue on new vehicles.” The London Guardian , on February 24, 2002, in an ar ticle titled “Drivers Face Road Charge by Satellite,” reported that dr ivers face charges up to 45 pence (around 65 cents) a mile. Such plans would effectively turn your car into a taxicab for the New World Order. This entire tracking/taxing grid is being set up to be integrated with the world tax on fossil fuels known as the Kyoto Treaty. We saw all this coming in 1997, when I got arre sted protesting that fact that Texas had already implemented mandatory biometric face/ thumb scans to get a driver’s license. I led a protest of over 100 concerned citizens at th e State driver’s license facility in Austin, Texas, pointing out that the database created by this agency in concert with the Federal government was to be used as a part of a cas hless society taxation control-grid. In my case, disorderly conduct charges mysterious ly disappeared off the books. The control- freaks didn’t want to create a court case wh ere I could challenge them for violating my God-given rights.

In the civilian world, people receive mechanical hearts and other organs. Society has come to accept most of these implants as a fact of life. By 2025 it is possible medical technology will have nerve chips that allow amputees to control artificial limbs or eye chips that allow the blind to see.

GP: Yes, well, see one of the things that happe ned is that - we've got examples from, I've got inside documents recently from Argentina, the secret Argentine plan. This is signed by Jim Wolfensen, the presiden t of the World Bank. By the way, just so you know, they are really upset with me that I've got the documents, but th ey have not challenged the authenticity of the documents. First, they di d. First they said thos e documents don't exist. I actually showed them on televi sion. And cite some on the we b, I actually have copies of some... AJ: Greg Palast dot com? GP: Yes, gregpalast.com. So then they b acked off and said yea those documents are authentic but we are not going to discuss them with you and we are going to keep you off the air anyway. So, that's that. But what they were saying is look, you take a country like Argentina, which is, you know, in flames now . And it has had five presidents in five weeks because their economy is completely destroyed. AJ: Isn't it six now? GP: Yea, it's like the weekly president because they can't hold the nation together. And this happened because they started out in th e end of the 80s with orders from the IMF and World Bank to sell-off all their assets, public assets. I mean, things we wouldn't think of doing in the US, like selling off their water system. AJ: So they tax the people. They create big government and big government hands it off to the private IMF/World Bank. And when we ge t back, I want to get to the four-parts that you elegantly lay out here where they actual ly pay off the politicia ns billions to their Swiss bank accounts to do this transfer. GP: That's right. AJ: This is one of the bigges t stories ever, please continue. GP: So what's happening is - this is just one of them. And by the wa y, it's not just anyone who gets a piece of the action. The water system of Buenos Aires was sold off for a song to a company called Enron. A pipeline was so ld off, that runs between Argentina and Chile, was sold off to a company called Enron. AJ: ...And then the globalists blow out their shell corporation, En ron after transferring the assets to another dummy corporation and then they just roll the theft items off. GP: You've got it. And by the way, you know why they moved the pipeline to Enron is that they got a call from some body named George W. Bush in 1988. AJ: Unbelievable. Stay right there. We are talking to Greg Palast.

    "pageContent": " 127 AJ: We are talking to Greg Palast. He is an award-winning journali st, an American who has worked for the BBC, London Guardian, who has dropped a massive bomb-shell on the Globalists and their criminal activity. There is no other word for it. You link through at inforwars.com, you can link to his web site - gregpalast.com, or any of the other great reports he has been putting out. He now has the secret documents. We have seen the activity of the IMF/World Bank for years. They come in, pay off politicians to tran sfer the water systems, the railways, the telephone companies, the nationalized oil compan ies, gas stations - they then hand it over to them for nothing. The Globalists pay them off individually, billions a piece in Swiss bank accounts. And the plan is total slavery for the entire population. Of course, Enron, as we told you was a dummy corporation for money laundering, drug money, you name it, from the other reporters we have had on. It's just incredibly massive and hard to believe. But it is actually happening. Greg Palast has now broken the story world- wide. He has interviewed the former top World Bank economist. Continuing, Sir with all these points... for the average person out there, in a nutshell, what is the system you are exposing? GP: We are exposing that they are systema tically tearing nations apart, whether it's Ecuador or Argentina. The problem is some of these bad ideas are drifting back into the U.S. In other words, they have run out of pl aces to bleed. And the problem is, this is the chief economist, this is not some minor guy. By the way, a couple of months ago, after he was fired, he was given the Nobel Prize in Ec onomics. So he is no fool. He told me, he went into countries where they were talking about privatizi ng and selling off these assets. And basically, they knew, they literally knew and turned the other way when it was understood that leaders of these countries and the chief ministers would salt away hundreds of millions of dollars. AJ: But it's not even privatization. They just steal it from the people and hand it over to the IMF/World Bank. GP: They hand it over, generally to the cronies , like Citibank was very big and grabbed half the Argentine banks. You've got British Petroleum grabbing pipelines in Ecuador. I mentioned Enron grabbing all over the place. An d the problem is that they are destroying these systems as well. You can't even get drinking water in Buenos Aires. I mean it is not just a question of the theft. You can't turn on the tap. It is more than someone getting rich at the public expense. AJ: And the IMF just got handed the Great La kes. They have the sole control over the water supply now. That's been in the Chicago Tribune. GP: Well the problem that we have is - l ook, the IMF and the World Bank is 51% owned by the United States Treasury. So the questi on becomes, what are we getting for the money that we put into there? And it looks like we are gett ing mayhem in several nations. Indonesia is in flames. He was telling me, the Chief Economist, Stiglitz, was telling me"

And he was saying that he questioned this and he got fired for it. But he was saying that they even kind of plan in the riots. They know that when they squeeze a country and destroy its economy, you ar e going to get riots in the street s. And they say, well that's the IMF riot. In other words, because you have ri ot, you lose. All the capital runs away from your country and that gives the opportunity for the IMF to then add more conditions. AJ: And that makes them even more desperate. So it is really an imperial economy war to implode countries and now they are doing it he re with Enron. They are getting so greedy. GP: I've just been talking to, out in California just ye sterday, from here in Paris, the chief investigators of Enron for the State of Califor nia. They are telling me some of the games these guys are playing. No one is watching that . It's not just the stockholders that got ripped off. They sucked millions, billions of dollars out of the public pocket in Texas and California in particular. AJ: Where are the assets? See, everybody says there are no as sets left since Enron was a dummy corporation - they tran sferred all those assets to other corporations and banks. GP: Well yea, this stuff has really gone just like a three-card Monty game. I mean remember that there is money at the bottom. You did pay California's electric bills according to the investigations, they ar e telling me that they were pumped up unnecessarily by 9 to 12-billion dollars. And I don't know who they are going to get it back from now. AJ: Well they caught the Governor buying it for $137 per megawatt and selling it back to Enron for $1 per megawatt and doing it over and over and over again. GP: Yea, the system has gotten completely out of control and these guys knew exactly what was happening. Well, you have to understa nd that some of the guys who designed the system in California for dere gulation then went to work fo r Enron right after. In fact, here I'm in London right now and we have, th e British has some responsibility here. The guy who was on the audit committee of Enron, Lord Wakeham. And this guy is a real piece of work, there isn't a conflict of interest that he hasn't been involved in. AJ: And he is the head of NM Rothschild. GP: There isn't anything that he doesn't have his fingers i n. He's on something like fifty Boards. And one of the problems, he was s upposed to be head of the audit committee watching how Enron kept the books. And in fact, they were paying him consulti ng fees on the side. He was in Margaret Thatcher's government and he's the one who authorized Enron to come into Britain and take over power plants here in Britain. And they owned a water system in the middle of England. This is what this guy approved and then they gave him a job on the board. And on top of being on the board, they gave him a huge consulting contract. So you know, this guy was supposed to be in charge of the audit committee to see how they were handling their accounts."

You can't have your own water. GP: Yea, and that's Lord Wake ham. I mean this is the guy from Enron. He is a real piece of work. He can't be touched here because like I say he actually regulates the media. So if you complain, he's got his hand on your pen. AJ: Burrow into NM Rothschild, you'll find it all there. Go through these four points. You’ve got the documents. The IMF/World Ba nk implosion, four points, how they bring down a country and destroy the resources of the people. GP: Right. First you open up the capital markets. That is, you sell off your local banks to foreign banks. Then you go to what's called market-based pricing. That's the stuff like in California where everything is free market a nd you end up with water bills - we can't even imagine selling off water companies in th e United States of America. But imagine if a private company like Enron owned your water. So then the prices go through the roof. Then open up your borders to trade - comple te free marketeering. And Stiglitz who was the chief economist, remember he was runni ng this system, he was their numbers man and he was saying it was like the opium wars. He said this isn' t free trade; this is coercion trade. This is war. They are taking apart economies through this. AJ: Well look, China has a 40% tariff on us, we have a 2% on them. That's not free and fair trade. It's to force all industry to a country that the globa lists fully control. GP: Well, you know Walmart - I have a story in my new book about how Walmart has 700 plants in China. There is almost nothi ng in a Walmart store that comes from the United States of America, despite all the eagles on the wall. AJ: Exactly, like 1984, then they have big flags saying \"Buy American\" and there's hardly anything --- it's Orwellian double-think. GP: What's even worst is they will hire a fact ory and right next to it will be the sister factory which is inside a prison. You can imagine the conditions of these workers producing this lovely stuff for Walmart. It's really.... AJ: And if an elitist needs a liver, they just call. GP: (Laughs) I know, it's grim. In fact, I talk ed to a guy, Harry Wu, is his name and, in fact, he broke into, he's been in Chinese pr ison for 19 years. No one believed his horrible stories. He actually broke back into pris on, took a camera with him and took pictures of the conditions and said this is the conditions of factories where Walmart is getting its stuff made at, it's all...."

And I was threatened, if you ever air that again, you will be arrested. GP: Well you know, it is horrifying stuff that , unfortunately, I have been handed and Stiglitz, was very courageous for him to come out and make these statements. The documents really sealed it because it said this is what really happened. They really do say sign on the dotted line agreeing to 111 condi tions for each nation. And the public has no say; they don't know what the hell is happening to them. AJ: Go back into privatization. Go through th ese four points. That's the key. It sends billions to politicians to hand everything over.

I actually spoke to a Senator from Argentina two weeks ago. I got him on camera. He said that after he got a call from George W. Bush in 1988 saying give the gas pipeline in Argentina to Enron, that's our current president, George W. Bush. He said that what he found was really creepy was that Enron was going to pay one-fifth of the world' s price for their gas and he said how can you make such an offer? And he was told, not by George W. but by a partner in the deal, well if we only pay one-fifth that leaves quit a little bit for you to go in your Swiss bank account. And that's how it's done. AJ: This is the .... GP: I've got the film. This guy is very conser vative. He knows the Bush family very well. And he was public works administrator in Arge ntina and he said, yea, I got this call. I asked him, I said, from George W. Bus h. He said, yea, November 1988, the guy called him up and said give a pipeline to Enron. Now this is the same George W. Bush who said he didn't get to know Ken Lay until 1994. So, you know..... AJ: So now they are having these white-wash hearings... GP: Well, you know, I was there in May, telling people in Britain you've never heard of Enron, but ... And these are the guys who have figured out how to manipulate this government. In fact, we saw some interes ting documents, a month before Bush took office, Bill Clinton, I think to get even with Bush's big donor, cut Enron out of the California power market. He put a cap on the prices they could charge. They couldn't charge more than one-hundred times the norma l price for electricity. That upset Enron. So Ken Lay personally wrote a note to Dick Cheney saying get rid of Clinton's cap on prices. Within 48 hours of George W. Bush ta king office, his energy department reversed the clamps on Enron. OK, how much is that worth for those guys. You know that has got to be worth a lot, that paid off in a week all the donations. AJ: Listen at the bombs you are dropping.

A fifth of the population of Argentina is unemployed, and they said cut th e unemployment benefits drastically, take away pension funds, cut the e ducation budgets, I mean horribl e things. Now if you cut the economy in the middle of a recession that wa s created by these guys, you are really going to absolutely demolish this nation. After we were attacked on September 11, Bush ran out and said we got to spend $50 to $100 billion dollars to save our economy. We don't start cutting the budget, you start trying to save this economy. But they tell these countries you've got to cut, and cut, and cut. And why, according to the inside documents, it's so you can make payments to foreign banks - the foreign banks are collecting 21% to 70% interest. This is loan-sharking. If fact, it was so bad that they required Argentina to get rid of the laws against loan-sharking. beca use any bank would be a loan-shark under Argentine law. AJ: But Greg, you said it yourself and the doc uments show it. They first implode the economy to create that atmosphere. They set up the entire clim ate that does this.

AJ: Part 3 and Part 4. What do they do after they do that? GP: Like I said, you open up the borders for tr ade, that's the new opium wars. And once you have destroyed an economy that can't produ ce anything, one of the terrible things is that they are forcing nations to pay ho rrendous amounts for things like drugs - legal drugs.

The story has been featured on the cover of Esquire Magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as on television from England to Japan. This story of the occult rituals conducted by the New World Order el ite at the Bohemian Grove is true and documented on film. Occult Activities at the Elite Bohemian Grove in Northern California Exposed! Alex Jones Tells His Story Austin, TX -- Last July, documentary filmmaker Al ex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove, becoming the first person to capture the bizarre occult activities of the all-male elite club membership on videotape. This footage recently aired in England, Ireland and Scotland on UK Channel Four as Part Th ree of a four-part special: The Secret Rulers of the World. Alex Jones was inside the 2,700 acre elite compound for over five hours, and states, \"Thank God I caught the whole thing on videotap e because no one would believe me if I hadn’t. I have trouble believing what I witnes sed with my own two eyes. It was actually that bizarre.\" For over 128 years, world leaders have trav eled to Sonoma County California in the month of July. Almost immediately, bizarre ru mors began to circulate in the local press that something dark and occult was going on. Th e rumors entailed dark stories of men in black and red robes and a giant 40-foot stone owl, to which something, or someone was being sacrificed. Alex Jones, being a radio talk-show host had heard the rumors many times, so he decided to look into it and did some research. To hi s surprise, mainstream media articles from Parade Magazine, the Associated Press, Reuters, the Sacramento Bee, and the Washington Times confirmed the incredible. World leaders were traveling yearly to the rural redwood-covered hills of Northern Ca lifornia and photos actually existed of the giant stone owl and the men in black and red robes. \"I was angered,\" Jones said, \"that in over 50 years there had been only a handful of news stories written on Bohemian Grove, and that these stories calmly reported on the rumors and engaged in a whitewash, thus hi ding a giant story in plain view.\" Reading about all the law enforcement a nd Secret Service protecting the Grove’s mysteries every July, Jones took the cha llenge of Jon Ronson of World of Wonder Productions to \"blow Bohemian Grove wide-open with his hidden cameras.\""

    "pageContent": " 134 After traveling from Austin, Texas to San Fr ancisco, Jones and the other members of his team, met up with the British filmmakers and began a three-day investigation before attempting to enter the Grove. On July 15, 2000, Alex Jones and his assistan t, Mike, equipped with two hidden video cameras and disguised as members of the Bohe mian Club successfully infiltrated the elite cult compound. One of the most commonly asked ques tions is: How did they get in? Following is a transcript of a taped interv iew with Alex Jones, who describes his infiltration of the super-secret elitist camp and what he witnessed inside: \"The Bohemian Club lies within a range of large hills and cliffs with 300-400 ft. drops. The club itself consists of large log cabin -style homes built into the gorge walls. There is only one entrance on the north side of the compound, which is a paved road, appropriately named \"Bohemian Avenue.\" A low barbed-wire fence surrounds the entire perimeter of the club, but the fence doesn’t matter because there is only one place where the hills come together, leaving an opening traversable by foot or car. Simply state d, the Bohemian Grove is a walled city. After being dropped off near the Bohemian Cl ub, we inserted ourselves into the woods about 100 yards from the main entrance. After going over the barbed wire fence, we found ourselves in what can onl y be described as a moat. Th e entire area along the road to the foot of the cliff walls had been dug out and flooded. We were able to make our way across the expansive swamp by jumping from broken tree limbs and other debris. After climbing up a steep embankment, pulli ng our way up by grippi ng on tree roots, we found ourselves in a large parking lot, w ith hundreds of cars. We saw several dozen Bohemian Club employees/servants getting out of the vehicles, which were everything from Mercedes-Benz to Ford Tempos. At about 100 yards through the trees, we saw a much larger parking lot, filled with more late-model, luxury-style cars. Obviously, th is was the parking area of the actual 2,000 members of the Bohemian Club. When you come in on the main road, the moat, the swamp and the embankment are off to the right (off to the west) just 50 yards of so. By going across the swamp or moat, we made our way past the first two checkpoints, which consisted of a small guard shack on the left-hand side of the road and another 50 yards down the road another guard shack on the right-hand side of the road. It’s a good thing that we decided to sneak around the first two ch eckpoints, by entering through the Bohemian Grove employee parki ng lot, because the real checkpoints lie deeper inside the Grove. There was a checkpoint in the middle of the road (a large guard shack with several dozen security people) a nd then guard shacks on the left and right"

I told Mike I thought it would be a good idea if we tried to get on one of the large trucks (the flat-back open trucks that had padded seats that were picking up members of the Bohemian Club as well as the employees). So, we went ahead and walked through the woods to the Bohemian Club member parking area and waited for one of the large trucks to pull up, at which time myself and Mike climbed onto the back with two older gentlemen. Mike and myself made small-talk conversat ion as we got onto the black-top road and drove deeper into the Grove, now approachi ng these larger checkpoi nts. In the two or three minutes that we were on board the tr uck, we caught an interesting conversation on tape, as two of the members discussed the prices of their ceremonial r obes (all of that is in my video, Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove). Our first close call happened as we neared the main checkpoint. The truck actually stopped, at which time an older, gray-haired ma n made eye contact with the driver of the truck and walked around the back of the truck to stare myself and Mike right in the eye. Obviously, he was afraid that we might be guests of the two olde r gentlemen we were riding in with in the truck (as Bohemian Club members are allowed to bring guests) so he didn’t ask us who we were or what we were doing. The guards went ahead and waved us on with a look of suspicion. Then we were really inside the Bohemian Gr ove. We had heard all of the bizarre rumors and were about to find out what was real ly going on inside. The mystery was getting closer to being solved. The truck drove in for several more minutes and stopped at which time we off-loaded. I told Mike that I wanted to get to cover. It took us about 45 minutes to an hour to walk all the way through to the bottom of the gorge, at which point the road ended and a car could no longer drive on it, as it turned into a concrete-p aved, blacktop foot-path. We reached the end of the gorge, which is an observation deck at the top of a 300-foot cliff overlooking the Russian River and the sma ll town of Monte Rio on the other side. It was my plan to have the least amount of c ontact with the Bohemian Club members and staff as I could and to wait until nightfall to attempt to get out our hidden cameras and to catch the Cremation of Care ceremony on tape. At this point, I should digress and go back and say that as we were walking into the Grove we came within about ten yards of the 40 foot stone owl that s its to the north side of the small lake. We were only about seven ya rds away from the black altar that sits at the base of the owl. So, already at this point we had proven a big rumor true: yes there is a giant stone owl – yes there is an altar. As we were walking d eeper into the grove, past the lake, we even saw little metal crosses sticking up from the wa ter’s edge. We’ll get to those little metal crosses later."

All of the sudden, there was an olde r gentleman, about 67-70 years old, wearing a Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department uniform coming up the path . We didn’t even see him coming. I believe he was the Sheriff, and he started speaking to us in some kind of code. He looked directly at me and said, \"Wer e you here in 1913? Are you one of the old ones?\" Now obviously, I was 27 years old and the ma n knew I wasn’t around in 1913 and that I wasn’t one of the old ones. Knowing that he was testing me, I just calmly said, \"Yeah, I’m with the Hillbillies.\" To explain that, there are about 95 different clubs within the B ohemian Club. All the different club houses and log cabin-style mans ions that are built into the cliffs have different names and different memberships. The most elite club, according to press reports is Mandaley, with Henry Kissinger a nd Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve Chairman and other New World Order bosses. The Hillbilly Camp is the camp that the Bu shes are members of, along with many other notables in American industry, banking, medi a and government. At that point he smiled and said, \"Well, enjoy the day.\" He then turned around and walked off. After he left I said to Mike, \"Look, we’ve got to get to a new position and hide ourselves in the woods.\" So we traveled back into the gorge, off the cliffside and the observation deck. About half-way into the gorge, we noticed that two men in dark suits and sunglasses were following us. I decided to slow down. The two men ,who were obviously private secu rity, Secret Service or somebody’s private body guards, walked up to us and asked us our names. I gave them my fake name and Mike gave them his fake name, and we told them that we were members of the Hillbilly Club. They said, \"take it easy, don’t stress yourselv es out and enjoy yourselves,\" which was a theme that came up more later. At this point, we had been confronted twice and were now being followed. I told Mike that we had to ge t into a heavily populated area where a lot of the Grove members were congregating. So we went into several of the clubs and al most had our identities blown. We went in and had a few drinks, because everyone was drinki ng copiously and they were offering us wine in some of the clubhouses. We then got back on the road and into a large outdoor feasting area, where hundreds of tables were being set from some party or revelry. I told Mike we should go up the steep road into the hills where some of the larger structures were located. It took us about 20 minut es to walk up the road into the only hills that were accessible by foot. At that point some of the employees began to ask us why weren’t riding the truck up. We told them that we wanted exercise, at which point they started acting pretty suspicious."

So we went into the Web Camp and just made ourselves comfortable. (The camps have different names like Lost Boys, Doom, Dragon etc.) We simply sat out the next hour, reloaded our hi dden cameras and got them back into place. By then, the shadows were getting long and it was just a few minutes until dusk. We started to hear bizarre chan ting and singing coming from down below us in the gorge. So we traveled back into the gorge. On our way back down, we saw thousands of men chanting and singing drunkenly be neath the giant redwoods. It was like something out of a fantasy nove l. I expected to see a dragon come hopping by any moment. There were huge skulls hanging do wn from the floodlights, satanic-styled owls with glowing eyes, (a lot of trappings of death) that we could now see in the twilight illuminated by the large floodlights. The feasting revelers were beginning to br eak up and to travel down paths towards the lake. We decided to go ahead and mix in w ith them and go where they were going. They were going towards the east side of the bank about 100 yards across the north tip of the lake where the idol and altar stood. As we were walking around the lake, the only black man we saw, a very large man, saw myself and Mike walking very quickly comp ared to other members in the crowd (we wanted to get a good place on the east side of the bank to watch the Cremation of Care ritual – most of the rumors I had heard were now coming true). He said, \"trouble yourselves not! Take it ea sy! The cares of the world are off your shoulders! You’re not supposed to walk that fast.\" He then gave us two full-color programs. On the cover of the program, they show Moloch, the big owl, with a burning body enflamed beneath it (the program can be viewed at infowars.com). [note to publisher: please insert image: bg/program _scan with the following caption: Program Cover from the Bohemian Grove Cremation of Care Ceremony] Also a little demon, with the initials PJ was sweeping up someone’s as hes on the lower left-hand corner of the program (which is also on my film, Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove) [note to publisher: please insert image: bg/program _demon with the following caption: Demon “PJ” on Program Cover from the Bohemian Grove Cremation of Care Ceremony] . Thousands of the men began to gather on th e eastern bank, private servants (as opposed to the Bohemian Grove employees, who all we ar red shirts and who weren’t allowed to be present for the ritual) began to put out chairs for their elderly employers. The sun had now sunk behind the hill. It was completely dark and you couldn’t even see the other side of the water. There were bats flying around and a lot of natural fog building on the surface of the water (there is a lot of f og in Northern California that time of year). Picture this, if Count Dracula lived in Nort h America, he would live in Sonoma County. This was spooky stuff. The hair on the back of my neck was beginning to stand up at this point."

Then we noticed something that we had seen during the day. Large black canopies had been unfurled out of the trees on the western side of the bank (we’re on the eastern side – only about 70 yards away at th at point) and they unf urled those, and the wagon pulled behind it. The men then began to yell out, breathing h eavily, \"burn him again! He’s going to get what he deserves! Kill that son of a bitch!” Now, I must digress and say that the reason I was able to see the priest in the black robes, the priest painted-up like death, and the bound body on the back of the wagon, was because they were all carrying torches. The place was somewhat illuminated by the torches being carried by the thirty priests in front and the thirty priests behind the wagon. Probably out of the entire r itual that I witnessed, the mo st important aspect of the ceremony was what happened first. The wa gon went behind these big black sheets hanging out of the trees, down to the gr ound, obscuring the view, and for about 10 minutes nothing happened. It was quiet except for the hateful shouts of the old men, who said things like, \"Oh yeah! Burn that bastard! Kill him! That’s what he deserves!\" All we could hear was them whispering and smacking their lips. This went on and on. Now on the west side of the bank, (we’re we re on the east side, about 60-70 yards away) at the front, about 100 yards away on the north side, is the idol, sit ting in darkness. No one was paying attention to that. Everyone was distracted as they stared across the water at whatever was happening behind those black curtains with that bound body. Whether it was an effigy or real, we do not know. (This is kind of like the Skull and Bones ritual that the New York Observer caught on tape. They claim that the video shows them slitting the throats of ceremonial effigies.) Is all of this in effigy? We don’t know. We were all focused at what was going on across the pond. Suddenly the owl was lit up by some flood lights and out ran a hundred prie sts or so in black, red and green robes. Most of them were in black, some in red and a couple in silver or green robes. Then, out came the high priest, who went th rough all his incantations about the dead (who is dead at the Grove in the past, may their spirits be conjured and brought back there by the \"great owl\"). He praised the ow l for about twenty minutes and he talked about \"goodly Tyre and Babylon.\" (I know how bizarre this all sounds , just remember that we have all of this on tape in my video, Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove , which has aired nationally in the United Kingdom, and might air here in the United States, unless it is suppressed.) So, the priest talked about \"goodly Tyre a nd Babylon.\" Well,, there is only one \"great owl\" of Babylon and \"goodly\" Tyre. If you read your Bible, or any hi storical document of"

Suddenly, (again, we had initially been misd irected from the owl by the activities behind the curtains across the bank, then we were pa ying attention to the owl and the priests on the island ) back on the west bank, there was an old-fashioned river-st yle boat, with that grim reaper character who had been drivi ng the wagon, and he was poling himself across the water with the bound body up on the bow. He brought the bound body to the high priest w ho was waiting for it at the foot of the owl, at the bottom of large circular steps on which the owl sits. Then, in very macabre fashion, two of the black-clad priests r ubbed and caressed the sacrificial body and brought it before the owl. The body begged for its life, over a speaker system. They refused it mercy. They took it up onto the altar. The \"great owl\" told them to burn the body (which they called \"dull care,\")which looks like a human wrapped up in black cloth. Right above the altar there was a large stone lamp that was burning that th ey call the \"eternal flame.\" The high priest took an unlit torch and lit his torch with this flame. The body again begged for mercy. The high priest then walked down (with some difficulty, because this high priest was so old, he could hardly even walk), and lit the pyre on fire. He began to say that he would read the signs in the re mains, a deep occult tradition. This is not the Ho llywood devil with red pajamas – this is the real deal, Babylon mystery religion-style. The body continued to scream in pain. Suddenly, all of those little metal crosses that we had seen along the bank during the day burst into flame. So, I was there witnessing something right out of the medieval painter Hieronymus Bosch’s Visions of Hell : burning metal crosses, priests in red and black robes w ith the high priest in a silver robe with a red cape, a burning body screaming in pai n, a giant stone great-horned owl, world leaders, bankers, media and the head of academ ia engaged in these activities. It was total insanity. So the ritual ended and all the old men star ted breaking up and going back to the big hall in the giant redwoods. Myself and Mike high-ta iled it out of there, walking at a brisk pace. We encountered no resistance when we left. We walked right by guards and were out on the main road, Bohemian Avenue. It is a lot easier to get out of the Grove than it is to get in, because a lot of these world leaders that you read about in the news leave the Grove to go into the small town Monte Rio. They go into the bars for prostitutes that are flown in from around the world to service them. Down the road the British media was waiting to pick us up. They asked us, \"Did you get it? Did you get it?\" One of the producers, John Sergeant, sa id, \"You’ve done it Alex! You’ve blown Bohemian Grove wide open!\""

You really need to get the film, or at least l ook at the photos or the stills of the video on infowars.com. Look at the program there with the burning body and r ead the mainstream media news stories about the history of the Grove, and you will realize how real all this is. You need to do this because a week after I got out of the Bohemian Grove, a group called the Bohemian Grove Action Network, (a group th at protests the Grove and is against the corruption, elitism and how women are denied access, because the Grove is all-male, of course), contacted different pr ess outlets. I got te n unsolicited media calls from the west coast media. I gave them the information, and we put the video clips on the web at infowars.com. They all said that the inf iltration and what our cameras caught on tape would be a huge story. After that, we never heard from them again. That shows the power of the Grove. The onl y places we have been able to get information out about Bohemian Grove has been on talk radio across the country, the Internet, and now across the United Kingdom. Hopefully, they’ve broken the ice abroad by broadcasting this over UK Channel Four a nd this true story of Bohemian Grove will make it into the mainstream United States media. This has really been life changing for me, to go in there and witness this and then have some people spin it, like, \"oh, it’s just frater nity fun.\" These people were deadly serious. This is a story that needs to be told and th e establishment is trying to suppress it. Please spread this information to every corner of the world. Alex Jones WWW.INFOWARS.COM "

In reality, Communism is merely a bastar d child of the New World Order. Communism consolidates the people’s weal th into the hands of an all-powerful central state, and national sovereignty is then collapsed into the greater hegemony of world government. Never the less, it is a vitally important exercise to read the Communist Manifesto written by Marx and Engels in 1847. In this exercise, examine each of the te n planks and then compare them to the current political climate of the United Stat es – our laws, government structures, and the outlook of the Amer ican people. It is clear to anyone who has a rudimentary understanding of political systems that th e globalists have implemented at least eight of the planks in the Unit ed States, with the other two partially in place. We as Americans have been coerced and manipulated by the occupational government to become practicing communists. This is wh at the global banking cartels wanted all along: to sell the people on accepting fe udalism by packaging it as a movement for and by the people. THE TEN PLANKS OF THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO 1. Abolition of private property and the a pplication of all rent to public purpose. 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. 3. Abolition of all ri ghts of inheritance. 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. 5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly. 6. Centralization of the means of communicati on and transportation in the hands of the State. 7. Extention of factories and instruments of production owned by the State, the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, a nd the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. 8. Equal liablity of all to labor. Establis hment of Industrial ar mies, especially for agriculture."

IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the th irteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it beco mes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal st ation to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be se lf-evident, that all men are cr eated equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just pow ers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government b ecomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in su ch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be ch anged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them unde r absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferan ce of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in dire ct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass La ws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinqui sh the right of Representa tion in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into"

    "pageContent": " 155 A MESSAGE FROM ALEX JONES I have been absolutely amazed and excited by the incredible response I have received from people who have gotten my latest film, 911: The Road to Tyranny . The new film and my new book, 911: Descent into Tyranny are, without a doubt, some of the best tools we have to pull back the curtain of lies and manipulation being spewed by the propaganda systems of the New World Order. I’m asking everyone who is impressed with the new film and this book to order additional first generation copies and to give and/or resell them to the public. By doing this, you will support those who are fighting for freedom. And just as important, by purchasing original copies, you will ensure that a high-quality book or film gets into the people’s hands. Freedom lovers all over the world are setting up public and private view ings of my film in churches, schools, gun shops, hunting and shooting clubs, veterans ’ organizations and even local movie theaters in an effort to alert the population. Af ter the viewing, many of these activists offer original copies of 911: The Road to Tyranny purchased from us for sale. In a similar way, my book could be offere d in these venues, or in local stores or bookfairs. You don’t need to do the math to understand the explosive power of grassroots action in the infowar. The Republic is in great danger of being completely overthrown and needs your help now. "
