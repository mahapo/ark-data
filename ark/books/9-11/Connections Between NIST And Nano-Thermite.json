[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Top Ten Connections Between NIST and Nano-Thermites Kevin R. Ryan, 7-02-08 “ Was the steel tested for explosives or thermite res idues? ... NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel .” NIST Responses to FAQs, August 2006 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has had considerable difficulty determining a politically correct sequen ce of events for the unprecedented destruction of three World Trade Center (WTC) build ings on 9/11 (Douglas 2006, Ryan 2006, Gourley 2007). But despite a number of varia tions in NIST’s story, it never considered explosives or pyrotechnic materials in a ny of its hypotheses. This omission is at odds with several other striking facts; first, t he requirement of the national standard for fire investigation (NFPA 921), which calls for test ing related to thermite and other pyrotechnics, and second, the extensive experience NIST investigators have with explosive and thermite materials. One of the most intriguing aspects of NIST’s divers ionary posture has been their total lack of interest in explosive or pyrotechnic featur es in their explanations. Despite the substantial evidence for the use of explosives at t he WTC (Jones 2006, Legge and Szamboti 2007), and the extensive expertise in expl osives among NIST investigators (Ryan 2007), explosives were never considered in th e NIST WTC investigation. Only after considerable criticism of this fact did NIST deign to add one small disclaimer to their final report on the towers, suggesting they f ound no evidence for explosives. The extensive evidence that explosives were used at the WTC includes witness testimony (MacQueen 2006), overwhelming physical evidence (Gr iffin 2005, Hoffman et al 2005, Jones and Legge et al 2008) and simple common sense (Legge 2007). There is also substantial evidence that aluminothermic (thermite) materials were present at the WTC (Jones 2007), and the presence of such materials ca n explain the existence of intense fire where it would not otherwise have existed. Additio nally, despite agreement from all parties that the assumed availability of fuel allow ed for the fires in any given location of each of the WTC buildings to last only twenty minut es (NIST 2007), the fires lasted much longer and produced extreme temperatures (Jone s and Farrer et al 2008). These inexplicable fires are a reminder that the WT C buildings were not simply demolished, but were demolished in a deceptive way. That is, the buildings were brought down so as to make it look like the impact of the p lanes and the resulting fires might have caused their unprecedented, symmetrical destruction . Therefore, shaped charges and other typical explosive configurations were likely used, but there was more to it than that. Those committing the crimes needed to create fire w here it would not have existed otherwise, and draw attention toward the part of th e buildings where the planes impacted (or in the case of WTC 7, away from the building al together). "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This was most probably accomplished through the use of nano-thermites, which are high- tech energetic materials made by mixing ultra fine grain (UFG) aluminum and UFG metal oxides; usually iron oxide, molybdenum oxide or copper oxide, although other compounds can be used (Prakash 2005, Rai 2005). Th e mixing is accomplished by adding these reactants to a liquid solution where t hey form what are called “sols”, and then adding a gelling agent that captures these tin y reactive combinations in their intimately mixed state (LLNL 2000). The resulting “sol-gel” is then dried to form a porous reactive material that can be ignited in a n umber of ways. The high surface area of the reactants within energ etic sol-gels allows for the far higher rate of energy release than is seen in “macro” ther mite mixtures, making nano-thermites “ high explosives ” as well as pyrotechnic materials (Tillitson et al 1999). Sol-gel nano- thermites, are often called energetic nanocomposite s, metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) or superthermite (COEM 2004, Son et al 2007), and silica is often used to create the porous, structural framework (Cl apsaddle et al 2004, Zhao et al 2004). Nano-thermites have also been made with RDX (Pivkin a et al 2004), and with thermoplastic elastomers (Diaz et al 2003). But it is important to remember that, despite the name, nano-thermites pack a much bigger punch t han typical thermite materials. It turns out that explosive, sol-gel nano-thermites were developed by US government scientists, at Lawrence Livermore National Laborato ries (LLNL) (Tillitson et al 1998, Gash et al 2000, Gash et al 2002). These LLNL scie ntists reported that -- “ The sol-gel process is very amenable to dip-, spin- , and spray-coating technologies to coat surfaces. We have utilized thi s property to dip-coat various substrates to make sol-gel Fe,O,/ Al / Viton coatin gs. The energetic coating dries to give a nice adherent film. Preliminary experimen ts indicate that films of the hybrid material are self-propagating when ignited b y thermal stimulus ” (Gash et al 2002). The amazing correlation between floors of impact an d floors of apparent failure suggests that spray-on nano-thermite materials may have been applied to the steel components of the WTC buildings, underneath the upgraded fireproo fing (Ryan 2008). This could have been done in such a way that very few people knew w hat was happening. The Port Authority’s engineering consultant Buro Happold, he lping with evaluation of the fireproofing upgrades, suggested the use of “altern ative materials” (NIST 2005). Such alternative materials could have been spray-on nano -thermites substituted for intumescent paint or Interchar-like fireproofing primers (NASA 2006). It seems quite possible that this kind of substitution could have been made with few people noticing. Regardless of how thermite materials were installed in the WTC, it is strange that NIST has been so blind to any such possibility. In fact , when reading NIST’s reports on the WTC, and its periodic responses to FAQs from the pu blic, one might get the idea that no one in the NIST organization had ever heard of nano -thermites before. But the truth is, many of the scientists and organizations involved i n the NIST WTC investigation were"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"not only well aware of nano-thermites, they actuall y had considerable connection to, and in some cases expertise in, this exact technology. Here are the top ten reasons why nano-thermites, an d nano-thermite coatings, should have come to mind quickly for the NIST WTC investig ators. 1. NIST was working with LLNL to test and characterize these sol-gel nano- thermites, at least as early as 1999 (Tillitson et al 1999). 2. Forman Williams, the lead engineer on NIST’s adviso ry committee, and the most prominent engineering expert for Popular Mechanics, is an expert on the deflagration of energetic materials and the “ ignition of porous energetic materials ”(Margolis and Williams 1996, Telengator et al 1998 , Margolis and Williams 1999). Nano-thermites are porous energeti c materials. Additionally, Williams’ research partner, Stephen Margolis, has p resented at conferences where nano-energetics are the focus (Gordon 1999). Some of Williams’ other colleagues at the University of California San Dieg o, like David J. Benson, are also experts on nano-thermite materials (Choi et al 2005, Jordan et al 2007). 3. Science Applications International (SAIC) is the DO D and Homeland Security contractor that supplied the largest contingent of non-governmental investigators to the NIST WTC investigation. SAIC has extensive links to nano-thermites, developing and judging nano-thermite research propo sals for the military and other military contractors, and developing and form ulating nano-thermites directly (Army 2008, DOD 2007). SAIC’s subsidiary Applied Ordnance Technology has done research on the ignition of nan othermites with lasers (Howard et al 2005). In an interesting coincidence, SAIC was the firm th at investigated the 1993 WTC bombing, boasting that -- “ After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, our blas t analyses produced tangible results that helped iden tify those responsible (SAIC 2004).” And the coincidences with this company don ’t stop there, as SAIC was responsible for evaluating the WTC for terrorism ri sks in 1986 as well (CRHC 2008). SAIC is also linked to the late 1990s secur ity upgrades at the WTC, the Rudy Giuliani administration, and the anthrax incid ents after 9/11, through former employees Jerome Hauer and Steven Hatfill. 4. Arden Bement, the metallurgist and expert on fuels and materials who was nominated as director of NIST by President George W . Bush in October 2001, was former deputy secretary of defense, former dire ctor of DARPA’s office of materials science, and former executive at TRW. Of course, DOD and DARPA are both leaders in the pr oduction and use of nano- thermites (Amptiac 2002, DOD 2005). And military a nd aerospace contractor TRW has had a long collaboration with NASA laborato ries in the development of energetic materials that are components of advanced propellants, like nano-gelled"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"explosive materials (NASA 2001). TRW Aeronautics a lso made fireproof composites and high performance elastomer formulati ons, and worked with NASA to make energetic aerogels. Additionally, Bement was a professor at Purdue and MIT. Purdue has a thriving program for nano-thermites (Son 2008). And interes tingly, at MIT’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology, we find Martin Z. Bazant, s on of notable “conspiracy debunker” Zdenek P. Bazant (MIT 2008), who does res earch on granular flows, and the electrochemical interactions of silicon. Z denek P. Bazant is interested in nanocomposites as well (Northwestern 2008), and how they relate to naval warfare (ONR 2008). MIT was represented at nano-en ergetics conferences as early as 1998 (Gordon 1998). Bement was also a director at both Battelle and the Lord Corporation. Battelle (where the anthrax was made) is an organization of “experts in fundamental technologies from the five National Laboratories we manage or co-manage for the US DOE.” Battelle advertises their specialization in nanocomposite coatings (Battelle 2008). The Lord Corporation also makes h igh-tech coatings for military applications (Lord 2008). In 1999, Lord Corp was w orking with the Army and NASA on “ advanced polymer composites, advanced metals, and m ultifunctional materials ” (Army 1999). 5. Hratch Semerjian, long-time director of NIST’s chem ical division, was promoted to acting director of NIST in November 2004, and to ok over the WTC investigation until the completion of the report on the towers. Semerjian is closely linked to former NIST employee Michael Zach ariah, perhaps the world’s most prominent expert on nano-thermites (Zachariah 2008). In fact, Semerjian and Zachariah co-authored ten papers that focus on nano-particles made of silica, ceramics and refractory particles. Zachariah was a major player in the Defense University Research Initiative on Nanotechnology (D URINT), a groundbreaking research effort for nano-thermites. 6. NIST has a long-standing partnership with NASA for the development of new nano-thermites and other nano-technological materia ls. In fact, Michael Zachariah coordinates this partnership (CNMM 2008). 7. In 2003, two years before the NIST WTC report was i ssued, the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) and NIST signed a memo randum of understanding to develop nano-technologies like nan o-thermites (NIST 2003). Together, NIST and UMCP have done much work on nano -thermites (NM 2 2008). 8. NIST has their own Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST 2008). Additionally, NIST’s Reactive Flows Group did resea rch on nanostructured materials and high temperature reactions in the mid -nineties (NRFG 1996). "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"9. Richard Gann, who did the final editing of the NIST WTC report, managed a project called “Next-Generation Fire Suppression Te chnology Program”, both before and after 9/11. Andrzej Miziolek, another o f the world’s leading experts on nano-thermites (Amptiac 2002), is the author of “Defense Applications of Nanomaterials”, and also worked on Richard Gann’s f ire suppression project (Gann 2002). Gann’s project was sponsored by DOD’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), an organi zation that sponsored a number of LLNL’s nano-thermite projects (Simpson 20 02, Gash et al 2003). 10. As part of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Te chnology Transfer, NIST partners with the Naval Surface Warfare Center at I ndian Head (NSWC-IH) on Chemical Science and Technology (FLCTT 2008). NSWC -IH is probably the most prominent US center for nano-thermite technolo gy (NSWC 2008). In 1999, Jan Puszynski, a scientist working for the DURINT p rogram, helped NSWC-IH design a pilot plant to produce nano-size aluminum powder. It was reported that “ At that time, this was [the] only reliable source o f aluminum nanopowders in the United States” (SDSMT 2001), however, private companies like Argo nide and Technanogy were also known to have such capabilitie s. Among an interesting group of contractors that NSWC -IH hired in 1999 were SAIC, Applied Ordnance, Battelle, Booz Allen Hamilt on, Mantech, Titan, Pacific Scientific Energetic (see below), and R Stresau Lab oratories for “ demolition materials ” (NSWC 2000). A tragic coincidence left William Caswell, an emplo yee of NSWC-IH, dead on the plane said to have hit the Pentagon (Flight 77) . He had for many years worked on “ deep-black ” projects at NSWC-IH (Leaf 2007). The presence of Pacific Scientific Energetics (PSE) in this list of 1999 NSWC-IH contractors is interesting because PSE was the pare nt company of Special Devices, Inc (SDI). SDI specializes in explosives for defense, aerospace and mining applications, and was acquired in 1998 by John Lehman, 9/11 Commissio ner, member of the Project for a New American Century, and former Secretary of the N avy (SDI 2008). Lehman divested in 2001. With this in mind, it is worthwhile to reiterate th at nano-thermite materials were very likely used in the deceptive demolition of the WTC buildings, but most certainly played only a part in the plan. However, other high-tech explosives were available to those who had access to nano-thermite materials at the time. Like SDI, several other organizations with links to military, space and intelligence prog rams (e.g. In-Q-Tel, Orbital Science) have access to many types of high-tech explosives t o cut high-strength bolts and produce pyrotechnic events (Goldstein 2006). These organiz ations also have connections to those who could have accessed the buildings, like WTC ten ant Marsh & McLennan and former NASA administrator and Securacom director, James Ab rahamson. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In any case, it is important for those seeking the truth about 9/11 to consider what organizations and people had access to the technolo gies that were used to accomplish the deceptive demolition of the WTC buildings. It is a lso important to recognize the links between those who had access to the technologies, t hose who had access to the buildings, and those who produced the clearly false official r eports. To that end we should note that NIST had considerab le connections to nano-thermites, both before and during the WTC investigation. It i s therefore inexplicable why NIST did not consider such materials as an explanation for t he fires that burned on 9/11, and long afterward at Ground Zero. This fact would not be i nexplicable, of course, if those managing the NIST investigation knew to not look, o r test, for such materials.
