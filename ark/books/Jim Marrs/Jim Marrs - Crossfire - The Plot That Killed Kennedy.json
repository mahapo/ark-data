Kennedyis generally accepted by the population of the United States, it will have to beacknowledged that this truth came not from the government, the legal profession,or the news media—rather that truth will have come from the legion of individualcitizens who have refused to accept official but superficial and unsupportedexplanations. At the fiftieth anniversary, this legion of researchers had growntoo numerous to cite by name.Special thanks for this edition of Crossfire go to Maritha Gan, Tom Ruffner,Larry Sells, Robert Fullilove, Chip DeNure, Stan Szerszen, Larry Hancock, and EdHaslem, and to the superb editorial team at Basic Books, including AlexLittlefield, Collin Tracy, Jeff Williams, and Karl Yambert.Every citizen who gave of their time, effort, and resources to study,assimilate, and disseminate assassination information should come to be regardedas an object lesson on how the individual citizen can make an impact on a systemthat has proven either unable or unwilling to police itself."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE REVISED EDITION [Contents.html#rfm2]“Will we ever know the truth about the Kennedy assassination?”This is a question I have been asked many times over the years.The answer is unequivocally yes. We know the truth today. It has been staring usin the face at least since the public was able to see in the Zapruder filmKennedy’s body being thrust to the rear by a frontal shot.If Lee Harvey Oswald was solely involved, then all information regarding him andthe assassination should be available and Oswald should be as forgotten asCharles Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker who was the lone assassin ofPresident James A. Garfield in 1881. Unlike with Guiteau, because of the ongoingquestions and controversy over the JFK assassination, virtually everyone in theeducated world knows the name Lee Harvey Oswald.Fifty years after the event, basic evidence, such as location of wounds, autopsyphotographs and X-rays, fingerprints, accuracy of the weapon, even the famousZapruder film, remain controversial. This is indicative of conspiracy andcover-up.But, it is argued, if there was a conspiracy, wouldn’t someone have spoken outby now? They have. For years now, many books and speakers, along with myriadwitnesses and whistle-blowers, have brought forward bits of the truth, only tobe ignored, drowned out, and ridiculed by the corporate-controlled mass media,which to this very day has failed to present the full range of assassinationinformation in a comprehensive manner.Anyone could have shot the president—Castro agents, Mafia hit men, rogue CIAoperatives, KGB assassins, even the proverbial lone nut. But only high officialsof the federal government and their financial rulers had the power to misdirectan honest investigation and keep the truth of the JFK assassination from thepublic for half a century.So, the real question being asked is: “Will there ever be a news conference inwhich a ranking government official gives us the truth about the assassination?”The answer to this question is probably no. Too many careers are involved. TheEstablishment fears the loss of public trust even though their attempts throughthe years to stifle the truth of many issues have merely resulted in that veryloss.In the case of the JFK assassination, trust has long been part of the problem.When it comes to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, don’t trust anyone source. Don’t trust this book. Don’t trust even the government’s basicdocumentation and pronouncements. Today the evidence of duplicity and fraud istoo apparent to ignore.The assassination today is recognized as a turning point in American history.Beginning on November 22, 1963, American attitudes slowly changed frompost–World War II optimism and idealism to cynicism and mistrust of government.This loss of faith in government accelerated in the wake of the Vietnam War,Watergate, the Waco deaths, the Oklahoma City bombing cover-up, and the manyunanswered questions about the attacks of September 11, 2001. The wide gulfbetween the official government version of the Kennedy assassination and thefindings of those who have objectively studied the case has prompted cynicismand controversy.This updated edition of Crossfire provides detailed background information onthe men and organizations most likely to have been involved in a plot againstthe president. Also covered are the various attempts by governmental bodies toinvestigate and resolve what happened in Dallas. Attention is paid to the peoplebehind these investigations, how they arrived at their conclusions, thereliability of the information made available to them, and the possibility ofmisdirection and deceit.As an award-winning Texas journalist with more than fifty years ofnews-gathering experience, I have been in the singular position to learn thetrue story of the assassination. I have talked with many people involved,including Dallas-area government and law-enforcement officials and newsreporters. I spent time with Oswald’s wife, Marina, his mother, Marguerite, andJeanne DeMohrenschildt, who along with her husband, George DeMohrenschildt, wasa close friends of Oswald’s. I have interviewed assassination witnesses,including James Tague, Jean Hill, Bill and Gayle Newman, Charles Brehm, MalcolmSummers, Phil Willis, and many others. I have interviewed witnesses neverquestioned by the official investigations, such as Ed Hoffman, Gordon Arnold,Ester Mash, Beverly Oliver, and Madeleine Brown. And I have kept in contact withserious researchers of the assassination, collecting and correlating their work.Most important, I lived in the Dallas area during the time of the assassination.As a university journalism major, I met Jack Ruby while visiting his CarouselClub in the fall of 1963. In the fall of 1964, I interviewed Major General EdwinA. Walker, himself a suspect. Within five years of the assassination, I wasworking as a professional reporter in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex.A native Texan who grew up in this area, I understand its people, history, andpolitics. Yet, as a journalist, I have tried to maintain a professionalobjectivity. I was fortunate to have the time to study the JFK assassination asboth a working newsman and a researcher. I have no personal associations ortheories to protect.In 1976 I was invited to teach a course on the JFK assassination at theUniversity of Texas at Arlington. I am told that mine was the firstuniversity-level course in the United States to cover the assassination. Throughthis course, many new leads were developed—such as a witness to a gunman on theGrassy Knoll and the intimidation of Dallas witnesses by Warren Commission staffmembers and FBI agents. After thirty years, I retired from UTA with my view ofthe assassination unchanged.Only by gaining a broad view of the assassination can we begin to detect theoutlines of the conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of Kennedy, Officer J. D.Tippit, and the accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Any one particular issuecan be rationalized away as coincidence or happenstance.Always keep in mind that the United States in 1963 was an entirely differentplace and time than today. The public had a blind faith in government, whichseems hard to believe in light of today’s cynical standards. The news mediauncritically accepted official pronouncements and police work was conducted inan unsophisticated, even slipshod manner that would shock the highly trained andeducated officers of today.Witnesses tried to distance themselves from the accused assassin. Some, due toeither ignorance or a desire to be helpful, or on orders, lied about criticalevidence in the case, while the statements of others were misrepresented byinvestigating officials—for reasons both benign and otherwise. Governmentagencies were fearful of rumors that might have linked Oswald to them.Not one single matter of fact in this case can be accepted uncritically.Evidence of deceit, misrepresentation, and manipulation abounds. The very peoplecharged with finding the truth engaged in fabrication, alteration, andsuppression of evidence as well as intimidation of witnesses.So, what is the truth of the assassination?The front page of the December 1, 1976, edition of the Fort Worth Star-Telegramcarried my story concerning a new congressional committee tasked withinvestigating modern American assassinations. My lead paragraph stated:The new House Committee on Assassinations may find itself faced with thedistinct possibility that a coup d’état occurred in 1963—with the complicity ofU.S. Government officials.Today, nearly forty years after that statement, nothing has been made publicthat warrants changing that conclusion. With the hindsight of events such asWatergate, Vietnam, the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther KingJr., Ruby Ridge, Waco, the attacks of 9/11, the economic meltdown of 2008, andunfounded wars in the Middle East, Americans have begun to see the lies,corruption, and outright criminal activity within their own government.Within the probable coup that was the JFK assassination we can find efforts bycertain US government officials not only to cover up critical evidence but toblock any meaningful investigation. Such attempts at cover-up in a murder caseare a serious crime. Obviously, such activity cannot be ascribed to a loneindividual or even organized-crime members and certainly not Fidel Castro orNikita Khrushchev. The plot, though not a conscious action of the government asa whole, nevertheless was homegrown, cultivated within government agencies,especially the military. It was a palace revolt.Can this be proven? Turn the page and join me in studying the information thatcollectively reveals the plot that killed Kennedy.Why seek the truth of this man’s death? The answer is simple. Unless we as anation come to a truthful understanding of what happened to our chief electedofficial in 1963, we obviously cannot begin to correctly understand the eventsthat are affecting us today or take action to correct past wrongs.Not only do I seek the killers of President Kennedy, I seek the persons whoplanned the probable coup against Camelot—those who killed the confidence andfaith of the American people in their government and institutions. I seekelementary justice—for both the accused assassin and for the United States ofAmerica.J.M. 2013"},{"pageContent":"  Don’t let it be forgot  That once there was a spot  For one brief shining moment  That was known as Camelot  —ALAN JAY LERNER"},{"pageContent":"PART I [Contents.html#rpa1][images/f0001-01.jpg]THE KILL ZONE [Contents.html#rpa1]"},{"pageContent":"Dallas—The Stage Is Set [Contents.html#rch1]Although one of the youngest cities in Texas, Dallas has recorded a meteoricrise to greatness and prosperity. Beginning in the days before Texas became astate, Dallas has grown from a small way station for pioneers to a center ofcorporate business, insurance, banking, and oil and gas. By 1963, Dallas alreadywas the most influential city in the Lone Star State, second only to oil-richHouston.However, Dallas also had gained a reputation for being the stronghold ofarchconservatives, if not outright right-wing extremists. It is well-known inTexas police circles that during the 1940s and 1950s—and stretching into theearly 1960s—that if a man wanted a job as a Dallas policeman, it helped if hewas a member of the Ku Klux Klan, or at least the John Birch Society. The citypolice and other governmental offices were filled with members of these andother right-wing groups.But Dallas was instrumental in carrying Texas in a national election. So in late1963, the city was included on a quick political trip by President John F.Kennedy.The Thirty-fifth President [Contents.html#rsec1]John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the first US president born in the twentiethcentury. He was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, anunpretentious middle-class suburb of Boston. Contrary to later claims that theKennedys were part of the liberal Eastern Establishment, he was the secondoldest son of a family that began their American life with the immigration ofPatrick Kennedy from Ireland in 1848. Both grandfathers were prominentDemocratic Party ward bosses while a group of Irish leaders ruled the localparty but were discriminated against by society’s rulers.At age forty-three, Kennedy became the nation’s youngest president, and at thetime of his death at age forty-six, he had lived a shorter life than that of anyother president.His brief presidency—1,026 days—stirred the emotions of nearly every American.Hardly anyone was neutral about Kennedy. They either loved him or hated him.Yet Kennedy seemed oblivious to the controversies surrounding him. Perhaps dueto his privileged background, he increasingly appeared more concerned with greathistorical issues such as civil rights, war, and peace than with the parochialmatters of business and politics.Jack, as the future president was called by his friends, attended only the bestschools. At Choate School in Connecticut, though he graduated near the bottom ofhis class, he nevertheless was selected as the man “most likely to succeed.”A bout with jaundice forced him to drop out of college, but upon recovery, hejoined his older brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr., at Harvard. Maintaining only a Caverage, Kennedy concentrated on sports, particularly football. A somewhatsickly child, Kennedy had continuing bouts with illness compounded by a footballinjury that aggravated an already-weakened spinal column. For the rest of hislife, he suffered recurring back problems.In an effort to recuperate, Kennedy left school during his junior year to travelin Europe, where his father had been appointed US ambassador to Great Britainafter generous contributions to Franklin Roosevelt’s election campaign. Afterwar broke out, Ambassador Kennedy was forced to resign because of hisundisguised admiration for Germany’s Nazi regime.Young Kennedy returned to write a senior thesis about England’s complacentattitudes just before World War II. This thesis was well received at Harvard andlater was rewritten to become the best-selling book Why England Slept.He began to show interest in a writing career but was interrupted by joining theUS Navy two months before the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan.Early in the war, Kennedy served as an intelligence officer in Washington butwas transferred to the South Pacific after J. Edgar Hoover told his father aboutyoung Kennedy’s love affair with a suspected Nazi agent.In the summer of 1943, Kennedy was in command of a Navy patrol boat, the PT-109.During a patrol in the Solomon Islands, the boat was struck and broken in halfby a Japanese destroyer, the only such incident during the war. He pulled hiswounded chief engineer, Patrick McMahon, to a nearby island by swimming for fourhours holding McMahon on his back by gripping a strap of the man’s life jacketbetween his teeth. Later, Kennedy arranged for local natives to alert Navyofficials to the group’s location in enemy-held territory and they soon wererescued. Despite the loss of his command, Kennedy was hailed as a hero.The story hit the front page of the New York Times and Kennedy’s name becamewell-known in Boston. While recovering from his ordeal, Kennedy learned that hisolder brother, Joseph Jr., had been killed while flying a secret mission overEurope. His father’s political aspirations now fell on Jack Kennedy. After thewar, a reluctant Kennedy ran for and won a House seat from Massachusetts.In later years, Joseph Kennedy was quoted as saying, “I told him Joe was deadand it was his responsibility to run for Congress. He didn’t want to. But I toldhim he had to.”With the Kennedy name and Kennedy money behind him, Kennedy easily won two moreelections to Congress. Then, in 1952, he defeated Henry Cabot Lodge to becomejunior senator from Massachusetts.Despite an uninspiring senatorial career, by 1956 Kennedy’s name was brought upas a possible running mate for Democratic presidential hopeful Adlai Stevenson.Although he was edged out as vice presidential candidate by Estes Kefauver, agraceful concession speech caused Kennedy’s political stock to rise to newheights.With an eye toward the 1960 election, Kennedy and his supporters went all out toensure an impressive victory in his 1958 Senate reelection campaign inMassachusetts. Indeed, he won by the largest margin in the state’s history. By1960, Kennedy was ready for the Democratic presidential nomination, but therewere hurdles to overcome. One of these was the fact he was a Catholic and noCatholic had ever been elected president. He overcame this problem byentering—and winning—a series of state primary elections. In West Virginia, with95 percent Protestant voters, Kennedy beat senator Hubert Humphrey handily,thanks, according to FBI reports, to large organized-crime donations madethrough Frank Sinatra.At the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Kennedy waschallenged only by conservative Texas senator Lyndon B. Johnson. Despite a late“draft Adlai Stevenson” movement, Kennedy won on the first ballot by 806 votesto Johnson’s 409, thanks primarily to youthful supporters at the precinct level.The pragmatic Kennedy immediately knew that conservative Democrats were neededto win against Republican Richard Nixon, so he forged a temporary coalition byselecting the defeated Johnson as his vice presidential running mate, despiteobjections from labor and liberals. His selection of Johnson shocked Kennedy’ssupporters as well as Johnson’s.Years later, Kennedy’s secretary Evelyn Lincoln revealed that the FBI directorhad forced the appointment of Johnson as vice president under threat ofrevealing Kennedy’s sexual affairs. “It was blackmail,” she stated. “Themalicious rumors were fed to LBJ by J. Edgar Hoover about his [JFK’s]womanizing. . . . LBJ and Hoover had boxed him into a hole.”There was no thought of Johnson’s qualifications as president should anythinghappen to Kennedy. It was sheer spur-of-the-moment political tactics.Nixon and his running mate, Henry Cabot Lodge, tried to raise the issue ofexperience during the ensuing 1960 election campaign. “Experience Counts” wastheir slogan, despite the fact that both Nixon and Kennedy had been elected toCongress in 1946 and that Nixon was only four years older than JFK. The sloganmostly was intended to call attention to Nixon’s role as vice president underthe popular Dwight “Ike” Eisenhower.Kennedy’s Catholicism was attacked by some preachers who regaled theircongregations with the specter of a Vatican-dominated White House. The issueprompted Kennedy to tell a meeting of Protestant ministers in Houston, “Ibelieve in an America where separation of church and state is absolute—where noCatholic prelate would tell the president (should he be a Catholic) how to actand no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote.”The real turning point in the 1960 election apparently came in September whenKennedy and Nixon met in the first televised debates in American history. Thefour debates were viewed by nearly half the nation’s population and no onedenies that Kennedy emerged the victor. Interestingly enough, however, radiolisteners judged Nixon the winner.The debates were TV show business, anticipating today’s slick marketing ofcandidates. It was all image—Kennedy with a good makeup job appeared robust andself-confident while Nixon, suffering from little makeup and five-o’clockshadow, appeared unsure of himself. Their images aside, there was very littledifference in the positions of the two candidates on most issues.Ironically, when Kennedy called for support of the Cuban exiles in theirattempts to regain Cuba from Castro, he was propounding the very program thatNixon had been pushing for many months. However, Nixon felt compelled to attackKennedy’s suggestions as irresponsible since, as he later wrote, “the covertoperation [the upcoming Bay of Pigs Invasion] had to be protected at all costs”and, thus, Nixon came out opposing his own plans.Kennedy won the election, but by one of the slimmest margins in Americanhistory. He polled 34,227,096 votes to Nixon’s 34,108,546—a margin of 49.9percent to 49.6 percent. Affluent whites, college graduates, women, Protestants,farmers, senior citizens, and business and professional people mostly votedagainst this eastern liberal.Oddly enough, Kennedy’s highest ratings in the polls during his term in officecame just after the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961 as Americansrallied to their president. About 82 percent of those polled expressed approvalof his handling of the situation, which prompted Kennedy to remark, “My God,it’s as bad as Eisenhower. The worse I do, the more popular I get.” Hispopularity soared further in the fall of 1962, when his negotiation with Russianpremier Nikita Khrushchev brought an end to the Cuban Missile Crisis, largelyperceived in America as a victory over communist expansionism. In reality, itwas a quid pro quo deal in which Russia withdrew its missiles from Cuba inreturn for America’s removing its missiles from Turkey plus pledging not tosupport any further Cuban invasions.But by the fall of 1963, polls showed Kennedy’s popularity had dropped to 59percent, largely due to his stand on civil rights. His willingness to negotiatewith the communist world, his attack on the tax havens of wealthy corporations,and his attempts to regain civilian control over the Pentagon and itsintelligence agencies had engendered fear and hatred among the most powerfulcliques in the United States.Newsweek magazine reported that no Democrat in the White House had ever been sodisliked in the South. A theater marquee in Georgia advertised the movie PT-109with these words on its marquee: “See how the Japs almost got Kennedy.”Kennedy supporters were looking toward the 1964 election, hoping for a mandatethat would give Kennedy’s ambitious programs much-needed popular support. Itnever happened.In the fall of 1963, he went to Texas.[images/line.jpg]Kennedy had carried Texas by the slimmest of margins in 1960, largely throughthe efforts of the state’s powerful senator, Lyndon Johnson. He needed the statebadly in 1964, particularly if his hopes of achieving a large mandate were to berealized. According to Texas governor John Connally, Kennedy first talked ofcoming to Texas in the summer of 1962. He again mentioned it in the summer of1963.According to former senator Ralph Yarborough, he was contacted by Kennedy aidesin mid-1963 and was asked what could be done to help the president’s image inTexas. Yarborough told this author, “I told them the best thing he could do wasto bring Jackie to Texas and let all those women see her. And that’s what hedid, although I thought it was premature. I didn’t think he was going to do thatuntil 1964.”Thus, in an effort to enhance his image and to raise money, Kennedy, along withhis wife, made the fateful journey to Texas in November 1963. On November 21,they visited Houston and San Antonio, both cities with heavy defense and spaceindustries. There Kennedy came out strong for defense and NASA expenditures. Thecrowds loved it. That evening, he flew to Fort Worth, landing at Carswell AirForce Base and driving to the historic Hotel Texas for the night.In his hotel suite, original paintings by Van Gogh and Monet had been hung onthe walls in an effort to impress the Kennedys with Texas sophistication.The morning of November 22, Kennedy spoke at a breakfast in the hotel sponsoredby the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. Beforehand, more than 1,000 personscrowded in front of the hotel stood in light drizzling rain, which stopped justas the president made brief remarks. As the presidential party prepared to leavethe hotel, vice president Lyndon Johnson arrived to introduce his sister, LuciaAlexander, to Kennedy. Reflecting on the surprisingly warm welcome he hadreceived in Texas, Johnson later was to recall Kennedy as saying, “We’re goingto carry two states next year if we don’t carry any others: Massachusetts andTexas.” Johnson wrote in The Vantage Point that these were the last wordsKennedy spoke to him.As the rain clouds were breaking up, Kennedy drove back to Carswell for theeight-minute flight to Dallas. Fort Worth and Dallas are so close that evenbefore reaching its full altitude, Air Force One began its descent to Dallas.The flight to Love Field was necessary due to the rivalry between the two citiesover Dallas’s Love Field (still operating) and Fort Worth’s Greater SouthwestAirport (relocated and replaced by Dallas–Fort Worth International in 1969).Looking out the plane’s window, Kennedy commented to Governor Connally, “Ourluck is holding. It looks as if we’ll get sunshine.”As Air Force One landed at Love Field, the sky had cleared and a bright sunbrought Indian summer weather to north-central Texas. By the noon hour, manypeople were in their shirtsleeves. The occasional cool breeze from the north waswelcomed by Texans weary of the interminable summer heat, which often lasts wellinto the fall. It was the sort of day that stirs the blood, causing people toseek action outdoors, whether by working in the yard or attending the localfootball game.This day there was another reason for wanting to get outside. The president wascoming to town. The local media had been full of the news for days. The DallasMorning News carried headlines that morning reading, LOVE FIELD BRACES FORTHOUSANDS and DETAILED SECURITY NET SPREAD FOR KENNEDY. That morning’s editionhad even run a small map of the president’s motorcade route, which would takehim from Love Field to the new, modern Trade Mart. However, this map indicatedonly that the motorcade would travel west on Main Street through the downtownarea, through the well-known Triple Underpass, and on to Stemmons Freeway andthe Trade Mart, where President Kennedy was scheduled to attend a 12:30 p.m.luncheon.The city’s other daily paper, the Dallas Times Herald, had given a more detaileddescription of the route. A story published the previous Tuesday, headlinedYARBOROUGH GETS JFK TABLE SPOT, told how liberal senator Ralph Yarborough hadbeen invited to sit with Kennedy at the head table during Friday’s luncheon. Italso mentioned that the motorcade would “pass through downtown on Harwood thenwest on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out Stemmons Freeway tothe Trade Mart.”This was one of the only newspaper mentions of the zigzag in the motorcaderoute, which would violate Secret Service procedures and place the president ina small park named Dealey Plaza, an area surrounded by tall buildings on oneside and hillocks with shrubs and trees on the other.The motorcade had been scheduled to pass through the downtown business sectionduring the noon hour so office workers could watch the parade during lunch. Thisstrategy worked well. Literally thousands of Dallasites turned out in the balmysixty-eight-degree weather for a view of Kennedy.Texas politics were in disarray. The state’s Democrats had been aghast theprevious year when a Republican, former schoolteacher and radio disk jockey JohnTower, had been elected to fill Johnson’s Senate seat. Tower was the firstRepublican to win a Texas Senate seat since the War Between the States. Withmore than seventy Democrats vying for Johnson’s seat, the vote had been so splitthat Republican Tower won, much to the horror of state politicos. The DemocraticParty, dominant in the state since Reconstruction, was split betweenconservatives, headed by senator Lyndon B. Johnson and Governor John B. Connally(a former Johnson campaign manager), and a small but noisy group of so-calledliberals, led by Senator Yarborough. The party rift was serious. Yarborough andConnally were hardly speaking to each other. And Texas conservatives were highlyvocal against Kennedy’s policies toward Cuba, civil rights, and a nuclear testban with Russia, not to mention his plan to rescind the 27.5 percent oildepletion allowance, the foundation of Texas oil wealth.With Texas now a two-party state, unity within the Democratic Party was neededbadly. With the 1964 election year approaching, everyone—even his enemies—agreedKennedy seemed unbeatable. However, he still needed to win over a few key statesto acquire the broad mandate he was seeking. Texas was one of them. Apresidential visit seemed just the answer.Houston was the oil capital of the state, while Fort Worth and San Antonio werebig defense industry centers. It would be easy to tell those folks what theywanted to hear. Dallas was a problem. At that time, the city was totallycontrolled by Mayor Earle Cabell, brother of Air Force General Charles Cabell,whom Kennedy had fired as deputy director of the CIA following the failed Bay ofPigs Invasion and who had branded JFK a “traitor.” City politics were dominatedby the mayor’s cohorts on the all-white Citizens Charter Association.No visit to Texas could ignore Dallas, yet the city had earned a reputation forbeing both politically bedrock conservative and intolerant of any deviation fromthat position. A month earlier, US ambassador to the United Nations AdlaiStevenson had been pushed, spat upon, and hit in the head with a picket signwhile visiting in Dallas. Just the previous Tuesday, cashiered Army MajorGeneral Edwin A. Walker had made the news by shoving a TV cameraman during aDallas speech by governor George Wallace of Alabama.Stevenson, along with others close to Kennedy, warned the young president not tojourney to Dallas. But in early June, plans for a trip to Texas were finalizedduring a meeting between Kennedy, Connally, and Johnson in El Paso. In October,a motorcade was added to the plans.On November 22, apprehension within the Kennedy entourage concerning the tripwas still evident, especially in light of a full-page newspaper ad that ran thatmorning in the Dallas Morning News suggesting the president was soft oncommunism and guilty of traitorous activities. A leaflet handed out along themotorcade route was not as subtle as the newspaper ad. It pictured Kennedy undera headline reading WANTED FOR TREASON.Yet after landing at Love Field about 11:45 a.m., the Kennedy entourage foundthe Dallas crowds large, enthusiastic, and friendly, even though a fewConfederate flags flew in the background. With horns honking, radios blaring,and the shouts and cheers of the crowd ringing off the sides of the officebuildings, the scene was chaotic despite what had been hailed as one of thetightest security efforts in recent memory.As the motorcade swept toward the central business district, it reached speedsof almost thirty miles per hour. But once the motorcade reached downtown, thecrowds became larger, often spilling out into the street, and the pace slowedconsiderably.The motorcade was the center of attention."},{"pageContent":"Dealey Plaza—November 22, 1963 [Contents.html#rch2]The Motorcade [Contents.html#rsec2]Leading the presidential motorcade on November 22, 1963, was an enclosed sedandriven by Dallas police chief Jesse Curry. Sitting to Curry’s right was SecretService advance man Winston G. Lawson. In the backseat, behind Curry, sat DallasCounty sheriff J. E. “Bill” Decker and to his right was Secret Service specialagent in charge Forrest Sorrels.More than two car lengths behind was the presidential limousine, a speciallymade long dark-blue Lincoln Continental convertible sedan designated SecretService Car No. 100-X. Kennedy’s Secret Service code name was Lancer, apparentlya knockoff of the name Lancelot in the Camelot story.Driving the limousine was Secret Service agent William Greer, at age fifty-threethe oldest man in the White House detail. Next to Greer sat Roy Kellerman,assistant special agent in charge of the Secret Service White House detail.In the center of the car in fold-down jump seats were Governor Connally, on theright, and Mrs. Connally. In the rear, on a padded seat that could be raised orlowered mechanically, sat Kennedy, wearing a leather back brace. Mrs. Kennedysat on his left.Behind the limousine by about a full car length was a follow-up car forKennedy’s Secret Service guards, a 1956 Cadillac convertible touring sedanspecially equipped for the Secret Service and designated SS Car No. 679-X.Following this security car was a 1964 Lincoln four-door open convertiblecarrying vice president Lyndon Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, and senator RalphYarborough. Yarborough told this author that while the crowds on the street wereboisterous and friendly, when he looked up at the offices of the big companiesand corporations of Dallas, he never saw a smiling face. The driver of his carwas Texas state trooper Hurchel Jacks, and Secret Service agent Rufus W.Youngblood rode to the right of him. Their car was trailed by Johnson’s SecretService guards and the rest of the motorcade, consisting of five cars for localdignitaries, three cars for press photographers, one bus for White House staff,and two press buses.A pilot car, which preceded the motorcade by a quarter of a mile checking for“motor vehicle accidents, fires and obstructions along the route,” containedDallas deputy police chief G. L. Lumpkin, two Dallas homicide detectives, andLieutenant Colonel George Whitmayer, commander of the local Army Intelligencereserve unit.Oddly, while a press-pool station wagon had been designated to follow Kennedy’sSecret Service follow-up car (it had the number 5 taped on its side), for someunexplained reason it was shoved farther back in the motorcade. This preventedthe media representatives from witnessing the assassination or capturing it onfilm.Everyone in the presidential limousine appeared to be enjoying the open-air rideand the cheering admiration of the crowd, although Mrs. Kennedy was beginning tofeel warm in her pink wool suit and pillbox hat. As the motorcade cruised intothe downtown area, apprehensions of the Dallas visit seemed to dissipate asquickly as the morning’s overcast.Bob Hollingsworth, veteran Washington correspondent for the Times Herald, hadaccompanied the Washington press corps to Dallas. He noted, “The amazement overthe size of the crowd turned to awe. For those of us who had been with thePresident since he left the White House for Texas Thursday morning, this was thelargest, the most enthusiastic and the best reception he had received in Texas.”Up ahead clear blue sky could be seen past the long, dark corridor of tallbuildings as the presidential car entered a small, triangular plaza at the endof Main Street.The motorcade broke into the open space of Dealey Plaza, named after GeorgeBannerman Dealey, a pioneer Dallas civic leader and founder of the DallasMorning News. The 3.07-acre plaza, the site of the first home in Dallas as wellas the first courthouse, post office, store, Masonic lodge, and hotel, has beencalled the “birthplace of Dallas.” It was acquired by the city for theconstruction of the Triple Underpass, which allows railroad traffic to pass overCommerce, Main, and Elm Streets. The property was christened “Dealey Plaza” in1935 and placed under the authority of the city’s Park Board in 1936 with theofficial opening of the underpass.Both incoming and outgoing traffic between downtown Dallas and the major freewaysystems to the west is channeled through Dealey Plaza. It is bounded on the eastby Houston Street. Turning north from Main Street at the historic red, ornateCounty Court House, Houston was flanked to the east by the Criminal CourtsBuilding, containing the county jail and the sheriff’s office. In the same blockto the north was the white Dallas County Records Building. Opposite the recordsbuilding across Elm Street was the Dal-Tex Building. To its west was theredbrick building that in 1963 contained the Texas School Book Depository.Bisecting Dealey Plaza is Main Street, with Commerce Street branching off to thesouth and Elm Street curving in on the north. These three main arteries convergeon the west side of the plaza at the railroad bridge known as the TripleUnderpass. Facing Houston Street on the west are fountains and monuments toDealey. On the north and south sides of the plaza are two small arbors orpergolas, flanked on the east by a line of trees and shrubs and on the west by awooden stockade fence about five feet high.With a phalanx of Dallas motorcycle police officers clearing the way ahead, theblue Lincoln limousine carrying the Kennedys made a ninety-degree turn from Mainonto Houston in front of the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. Almost two dozendeputies and other lawmen stood on the sidewalk watching. All had been orderednot to take part in motorcade security.The bright sun began warming the car’s occupants as they approached the TexasSchool Book Depository. Atop the building was a large Hertz Rent-A-Car signcontaining a digital time and temperature display. In front of the Depository,the limousine slowed to a crawl to make a 120-degree turn onto Elm Street,although turns of more than 90 degrees were prohibited by the Secret Service.The turn was so tight that Greer almost ran the limousine up onto the north curbnear the Depository’s front door, according to Depository superintendent RoyTruly.The car continued a slow glide down the incline of Elm deeper into Dealey Plaza,maintaining its position in the center lane of the three-lane street. The crowdsthinned out as the Triple Underpass approached, and security men began to relax.About three car lengths ahead of the presidential limousine in the lead car,Agent Lawson, a former Army counterintelligence man now with the Secret ServiceWhite House detail, was sitting in the right front seat. He looked at his watch.It was 12:30 p.m. Picking up the car’s microphone, he radioed the Trade Martsaying, “We’ll be there in about five minutes.”In the presidential limousine, Kennedy was waving to his right at a group ofpeople standing near a large green sign reading STEMMONS FREEWAY. His right armand hand were extended slightly over the side of the car. Mrs. Kennedy had beenwaving to her left, but her thoughts were on the Texas heat. Mrs. Kennedy latertold the Warren Commission, “And in the motorcade, you know, I usually would bewaving mostly to the left side and he was waving mostly to the right, which isone reason you are not looking at each other very much. And it was terribly hot.Just blinding all of us.” Sensing her discomfort, Mrs. Connally turned and said,“We’ll soon be there.”Mrs. Kennedy recalled seeing the Triple Underpass ahead. “We could see a tunnelin front of us. Everything was really slow then. And I remember thinking itwould be so cool under that tunnel.”Mrs. Connally had wanted to mention the warm and enthusiastic welcome for sometime, but she had held back. Now she could contain herself no longer. Turning toKennedy, she said, “Mr. President, you can’t say that Dallas doesn’t love you.”According to Mrs. Kennedy, the president smiled and replied, “No, you certainlycan’t.”Soon after his remark, Mrs. Connally heard a frightening noise off to her right.She looked in that direction and caught a peripheral glimpse of Kennedy raisingboth hands to his neck. She heard no sound from the president but noticed ablank, “nothing” expression on his face.Kellerman, sitting directly in front of Connally and Kennedy, noticed they hadjust passed a highway sign when he heard a “pop” to his right and immediatelylooked in that direction, surveying the easternmost slope of the Grassy Knoll.Kellerman told the Warren Commission:As I turned my head to the right to view whatever it was . . . I heard a voicefrom the back seat and I firmly believe it was the President’s [saying] “My God,I am hit,” and I turned around and he has got his hands up here like this[indicating both hands up near the throat]. . . . [It] was enough for me toverify that the man was hit. So, in the same motion I come right back andgrabbed the speaker and said to the driver, “Let’s get out of here; we’re hit,”and grabbed the mike and I said, “Lawson, this is Kellerman . . . we are hit;get us to the hospital immediately.” Now in the seconds that I talked just now,a flurry of shells come into the car.Mrs. Connally testified she heard Kellerman say, “Pull out of the motorcade.Take us to the nearest hospital.” The limousine indeed pulled out of themotorcade, accelerated through the Triple Underpass, up the entrance ramp toStemmons Freeway, and raced toward Parkland Hospital.Driver Greer said he was busy looking ahead to the railroad overpass and neverlooked back. This is inconsistent with a film of the assassination that clearlyshows Greer looking back over his right shoulder prior to the head shot. Greerthen testified he heard a noise he thought was a motorcycle backfire. Then heheard the noise again and caught a glimpse of Connally starting to slump over.He then heard two more noises that seemed to come one on top of the other. Greersaid that after the second noise and a glance over his right shoulder atConnally, he stepped on the accelerator. However, film taken that day shows thelimousine brake lights remained on until after the fatal head shot to Kennedy.Mrs. Connally recalled that after the first sound “very soon there was thesecond shot which hit John [Connally].”Connally, in testimony consistent both with that of Mrs. Connally and with filmsmade that day, confirmed he was not hit by the first shot. The governor saidjust after making the turn onto Elm he heard a noise he took to be a shot from ahigh-powered rifle. He turned to his right because the sound appeared to comefrom over his right shoulder, but he couldn’t see anything. He began to turn tohis left when he felt something strike him in the back.Although critically wounded, Connally was conscious of shots being fired otherthan the one that struck him. Realizing that he had been hit a second or soafter hearing a shot, Connally told the Warren Commission, “There were eithertwo or three people involved or more in this or someone was shooting with anautomatic rifle.” Connally then heard a final boom and heard the bullet hithome. He later recalled, “It never entered my mind that it ever hit anyone butthe President. . . . He never uttered a sound that I heard.”Connally noticed blue brain tissue covering his suit and knew Kennedy was dead.He also noticed blood on the front of his shirt and realized he was hurt badly,perhaps fatally. Crumpling into the arms of his wife, Connally screamed out, “MyGod, they’re going to kill us all!” Connally heard his wife saying over andover, “Be still, you’re going to be all right,” and he felt the car accelerate.He then lost consciousness.During the initial phase of the shooting, Mrs. Kennedy did not realize what washappening. She was accustomed to the sounds of motorcycle escorts backfiring andthe motorcade had been a cacophony of sirens, racing motors, cheering, andshouting. She did hear Connally shout, “Oh, no, no, no!” She heard “terriblenoises” to her right and turned to see Kennedy with his hand at his throat and a“quizzical look on his face.” Then the chief executive was struck in the headand fell into her lap. All she could do was cradle him and say, “Oh, my God,they’ve shot my husband. I love you, Jack.”Over the years a great deal of misinformation has been presented about her nextactions. Many persons have stated she tried to climb out of the car in panic orto help Secret Service agent Clint Hill, who had run to the president’slimousine. Actually, she crawled onto the trunk of the limousine and, reachingout, picked up a piece of her husband’s head. Mrs. Connally told the WarrenCommission she recalled hearing Mrs. Kennedy crying out, “I have got his brainsin my hand.”Mrs. Kennedy next climbed back into the limousine under her own power as Hillwas desperately clinging to the car’s trunk as it accelerated.When talking to the Warren Commission on June 5, 1964, Mrs. Kennedy did not evenrecall this activity. But her action was captured in the films taken that day,and later, sitting in Parkland Hospital, she had the object still clutched inher hand. Dr. Marion T. Jenkins encountered a “shell shocked” Mrs. Kennedy inthe hospital hallway. “I noticed her hands were cupped in front of her, as ifshe were cradling something,” he recalled. “As she passed by, she nudged me withan elbow and handed me what she had been nursing in her hands—a large chunk ofher husband’s brain tissues.” Perhaps the reason this dramatic incident has beenconfused in the early years is that if brain matter flew to the rear, thisclearly evinces a shot from the front.In the lead car, which was just about to enter the Triple Underpass when thefiring began, Agent Lawson was trying to signal a policeman standing with agroup of people on top of the underpass. He didn’t like the idea of thepresident’s car passing directly below these people, so he was trying to get theofficer to move them to one side. The policeman never noticed him. Lawson mayhave recalled the security measures in Fort Worth earlier that morning whenoverpasses were cleared of bystanders and windows facing the president’s routewere closed by security personnel.Just then, Lawson heard a loud report to his rear. It sounded more like a banginstead of a crack and Lawson didn’t think it was a rifle shot. His firstimpression was that it was a firecracker. This description was to be repeated bynearly everyone in Dealey Plaza, with some notable exceptions, one being ForrestV. Sorrels, head of the Dallas office of the Secret Service. Like Connally,Sorrels was certain the first sound was a gunshot. After a brief pause, Sorrelsheard two more shots coming close together. He shouted to Chief Curry, “Let’sget out of here!”On hearing the first burst of fire, Sheriff Decker glanced back and thought hesaw a bullet bouncing off the street pavement. Motorcycle officer James Chaneytold newsmen the next day that the first shot missed.Another Dallas motorcycle officer, Starvis Ellis, in 1978 told the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations that as he rode alongside the car in which Deckerwas riding, he, too, saw a bullet hit the pavement. Neither Decker nor Ellis wasever questioned about this extraneous bullet by the Warren Commission.Curry saw a “commotion” in the presidential limousine. Then a motorcycle officerdrew up alongside. “Anybody hurt?” asked Curry. “Yes,” replied the officer.Stepping on the accelerator, Curry shouted, “Lead us to the hospital.” BothDecker and Curry took the car’s radio and ordered their men to rush to the topof the underpass and the adjacent railroad yards where they thought the shotshad originated.Those witnesses deep in the Dealey Plaza believed shots were fired from theGrassy Knoll, while those farther back in the motorcade—still on Houston andMain Streets—believed shots came from the direction of the Depository.Motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker was riding near one of the press cars. Hehad just turned onto Houston and his cycle was about to tip over because of agust of wind and the slow speed. He had just returned from a deer-hunting tripand recognized the first sound as a high-powered rifle shot. He thought thesound came from either the Depository or the Dal-Tex building. Seeing pigeonsfluttering off the Depository’s roof, he gunned his motor and roared up to theentrance of the building. Within seconds, he and Depository superintendent RoyTruly would encounter Lee Harvey Oswald calmly standing in the second-floorlunchroom of the Depository.Secret Service agent Paul Landis was riding in the right rear of the SecretService follow-up car when he heard the report of a high-powered rifle. He sawKennedy turn to look in the direction of the shot, which Landis believed camefrom “somewhere towards the front, right-hand side of the road.”With Landis was Secret Service agent Glen Bennett, who thought the sound was afirecracker. But then he looked at the president. In notes he said were madelater that day, Bennett wrote, “[I] saw a shot that hit the Boss about fourinches down from the right shoulder; a second shoot [sic] followed immediatelyand hit the right rear high [side] of the Boss’s head.”The Secret Service agents assigned to Kennedy all acted with remarkablesluggishness when the firing began. Perhaps it was due to the visit they hadpaid to a “beatnik” nightspot in Fort Worth, where they drank until early thatmorning.The only agent to react quickly was Clint Hill. Interestingly, Hill had not beenscheduled to make the Dallas trip, but joined at the last moment only after Mrs.Kennedy made a personal request. Hill also thought the initial sound was afirecracker and began looking to his right for the source of the sound when hesaw Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward slightly. He then realizedsomething was wrong and jumped off the follow-up car. He was racing the few feetto the limousine when he heard more shots. Hill had just secured a grip on ahandhold when the car began accelerating. Looking into the backseat of thelimousine, Hill saw that the right rear portion of the president’s head wasmissing.Nearly everyone present recalled a pause of several seconds between the firstburst of fire and the final two shots, these coming rapidly, one on top of theother. It was the third and final shot, or volley of shots, that killedPresident John F. Kennedy. Until then, he had been immobile and quiet, onlysagging slightly to his left. Then his head pitched forward violently for asplit second only to be pushed hard to the left and rear. A halo of crimsonliquid and tissue surrounded his head momentarily and then fell to the rear. Thehead shot lifted him slightly, then threw him against the car’s backseat. Hebounced forward and over into his wife’s lap.The two Dallas motorcycle officers riding to the left rear of the limousine,Bobby W. Hargis and B. J. Martin, were splattered by blood and brain matter.Martin, who had looked to his right after the first shots, later foundbloodstains on the left side of his helmet. Hargis, who was riding nearest thelimousine about six to eight feet from the left rear fender, saw Kennedy’s headexplode and was hit by bits of flesh and bone with such impact that he toldreporters he initially thought he had been shot.Presidential assistant David Powers was riding with Secret Service agents in thecar directly behind the president. From this vantage point, he described theentire assassination:I commented to Ken O’Donnell that it was 12:30 and we would only be about fiveminutes late when we arrived at the Trade Mart. Shortly thereafter the firstshot went off and it sounded to me as if it were a firecracker. I noticed thenthat the President moved quite far to his left after the shot from the extremeright hand side where he had been sitting. There was a second shot and GovernorConnally disappeared from sight and then there was a third shot which took offthe top of the President’s head and had the sickening sound of a grapefruitsplattering against the side of a wall. The total time between the first andthird shots was about five or six seconds. My first impression was that theshots came from the right and overhead but I also had a fleeting impression thatthe noise appeared to come from the front in the area of the Triple Underpass.This may have resulted from my feeling, when I looked forward toward theoverpass, that we might have ridden into an ambush.Several persons in the motorcade smelled gunpowder as the cars swept through thelower end of Dealey Plaza.Mrs. Earle Cabell, wife of the Dallas mayor, was riding in an open convertiblesix cars back from the motorcade’s lead car. At the opening shots, the car inwhich she was riding was passing the Depository building. She told the WarrenCommission she jerked her head up on hearing the first shot because “I heard thedirection from which the shot came.” Looking up, she saw an object projectingfrom one of the top windows of the Depository building. She said,I jerked my head up and I saw something in that window and I turned around tosay to Earle, “Earle, it is a shot,” and before I got the words out . . . thesecond two shots rang out. . . . I was acutely aware of the odor of gunpowder. Iwas aware that the motorcade stopped dead still. There was no question aboutthat.Mrs. Cabell was riding beside congressman Ray Roberts. She said he acknowledgedsmelling gunpowder too.Senator Ralph Yarborough also smelled gunpowder as the car carrying him andLyndon Johnson drove through the plaza. Yarborough, a former Army infantryofficer and an avid hunter, also failed to recognize the sound of the firstshot. He told this author:I thought, “Was that a bomb thrown?” and then the other shots were fired. Andthe motorcade, which had slowed to a stop, took off. A second or two later, Ismelled gunpowder. I always thought that was strange because, being familiarwith firearms, I never could see how I could smell the powder from a rifle highin that building.It does seem strange that people would smell powder from a shot fired more thansixty feet in the air and behind them. However, it’s not so strange, if a shotwere fired on top of the Grassy Knoll less than twelve feet in elevation with abreeze from the north to carry smoke to street level.Over the years, an argument has continued over whether the presidentiallimousine actually stopped. There is no doubt that it slowed, as in the OrvilleNix film, the brake lights can been seen coming on after the first shot. SecretService agent Clint Hill in the follow-up car stepped down and ran for thepresident’s car. He was grabbing for the rear handhold when it began toaccelerate.Witness Jean Hill supported Mrs. Connally by stating the limousine slowed to astop and even pulled over into the left-hand lane, although the Zapruder filmshows no such movement. Based on the reported speed of Zapruder’s camera, theWarren Commission determined that the limousine slowed to 11.2 miles per hourand “maintained this average speed . . . immediately preceding the shot whichstruck the President in the head.”Senator Yarborough may have gotten closest to the truth of the matter when heexplained to this author, “Look, you toss a ball into the air. At one point itstops going up and starts coming down. Did it stop?”One of the strangest omissions in the subsequent investigation by federalauthorities concerns a Navy commander who was assigned to film major eventsinvolving President Kennedy. In early 1963, Thomas Atkins was assigned as anofficial photographer for the Kennedy White House. As such, he traveled to Texaswith Kennedy and was photographing the motorcade with a quality camera, a 16 mmArriflex S. He was riding six cars behind Kennedy and filming as the motorcademoved through Dealey Plaza.In a 1977 article, Atkins said the car he was in had just turned onto HoustonStreet and was facing the Texas School Book Depository:Kennedy’s car had just made the left turn heading toward the freeway entrance.Although I did not look up at the building, I could hear everything quiteclearly. . . . The shots came from below and off to the right side from where Iwas [the location of the Grassy Knoll]. . . . I never thought the shots camefrom above. They did not sound like shots coming from anything higher thanstreet level.After returning to Washington on Air Force Two, Atkins assembled his footageinto a movie he titled The Last Two Days. He described the film as “terriblydamaging to the Warren Commission finding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the loneassassin.” Perhaps this explains why neither Atkins’s testimony nor his film wasstudied by either of the federal panels investigating the assassination. Atkinssaid in 1977, “It’s something I’ve always wondered about. Why didn’t they ask mewhat I knew? I not only was on the White House staff, I was then, and still am,a photographer with a pretty keen visual sense.”Obviously, the federal authorities didn’t want to hear from a man with a “keenvisual sense” and strong credentials who might have told them things they didnot want to hear.But if the stories of the motorcade witnesses differed from the later officialversion of the assassination, it was nothing compared to the stories to comefrom the crowd of bystanders.The Crowd [Contents.html#rsec3]The crowd of witnesses along the motorcade route through Dealey Plaza saw manythings that differed from the later official version. Even before the motorcadearrived, men with rifles were seen by people in downtown Dallas.Shortly before noon, Phillip B. Hathaway and coworker John Lawrence were walkingon Akard Street toward Main to get an observation spot for the motorcade whenHathaway saw a man carrying a rifle in a gun case. He described the man as verytall, six-foot-five or more, weighing about 250 pounds and thick in the chest.The man was in his early thirties with “dirty blond hair worn in a crew-cut” andwas wearing a gray business suit. Hathaway said the case was made of leather andcloth and was not limp, but obviously contained a rifle. He remarked to Lawrencethat it must be a Secret Service man.This same man may have been seen later that day by Ernest Jay Owens, who toldsheriff’s officers the afternoon of the assassination that he was driving onWood Street near Good-Lattimer Expressway when he saw a white male of “heavybuild” carrying a “foreign-made rifle” out of a parking lot. Owens said the manwas bareheaded and wearing a dark suit.Once Oswald was captured and proclaimed the assassination suspect, there was noeffort to investigate these stories further.A similar—but even more ominous—incident involved Julia Ann Mercer. Mercer, thentwenty-three years old, later told authorities that shortly before 11 a.m. theday of the assassination she was driving a rented white Valiant west on ElmStreet just past the point where Kennedy was killed about two hours later. Justafter passing through the Triple Underpass, she found her traffic lane blockedby a green Ford pickup truck containing two men..While waiting for the truck to move, she saw a young man get out of thepassenger side of the truck, walk to a long tool compartment along the side, andremove a long paper bag. She could see the outline of a rifle in the bag. Theman then walked up on the Grassy Knoll carrying the package and was lost to hersight. She described this man as in his late twenties or early thirties, wearinga gray jacket, brown pants, a plaid shirt, and some sort of wool stocking capwith a tassel on it. Mercer said as she pulled alongside the truck, she lockedeyes with the driver, whom she described as heavily built with a round face andlight brown hair.She said during this time, she saw three Dallas policemen standing by amotorcycle on the underpass talking. In Warren Commission Document 205, apoliceman did tell of seeing the truck, but believed that it had broken down.When she was finally able to change lanes, Mercer drove on toward Fort Worth,stopping at the halfway point of the Dallas–Fort Worth Toll Road (now Interstate30) to have breakfast. While eating, she spoke of her experience, commenting,“The Secret Service is not very secret.” As she drove on to Fort Worth, she waspulled over by policemen, who informed her of the assassination and took herback to Dallas for questioning. Apparently persons in the restaurant hadinformed authorities of her comments and presence at the assassination site. Shewas held for several hours and questioned by both local and federal authorities,although no one showed her a badge or identified himself.Early the next morning, FBI men came to her home and took her back to the DallasCounty Sheriff’s Office, where she was shown some photographs of various men.She picked out two as the men she had seen in the truck the day before. Turningone photo over, she read the name “Jack Ruby.” All this transpired prior toRuby’s well-publicized shooting of Lee Oswald the next day.During the TV coverage of the Oswald shooting, Mercer claims, she againrecognized Ruby as the man driving the truck and that Oswald resembled the mancarrying the rifle. Oswald’s mother also claimed to have been shown a picture ofRuby prior to the Sunday shooting of her son.Mercer later claimed that her story concerning the truck and its occupants wastwisted and changed by both the FBI and the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. Forexample, according to her sheriff’s department statement of November 22, shestated that a sign on the side of the pickup truck carried the words AIRCONDITIONING, a claim she later denied. This one seemingly small change in hertestimony sent investigators on a fruitless search for a truck with such a signand later served to discredit her account. Furthermore, Mercer was able toconvince New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison that her notarized signatureon the sheriff’s report was forged. After telling her story to Garrison in thelate 1960s, Mercer apparently realized how her account disrupted the officiallone-nut story and she became inaccessible to the public.Mercer’s experience may have been partly corroborated by another Dallasite,Julius Hardie, who told the Dallas Morning News years later that on the morningof November 22, he saw three men on top of the Triple Underpass carrying longarms, although he could not tell if they were rifles or shotguns. Hardie said hereported the incident to the FBI, but no such report has been made public.As the motorcade arrived in Dealey Plaza, it passed almost twenty sheriff’sdeputies standing at the intersection of Main and Houston in front of thesheriff’s office. They had gathered upon the sheriff’s orders earlier that daybut Sheriff Decker told them he had received a call from Washington advising himand his men to stand down and not participate in the motorcade’s security.In affidavits, the deputies almost unanimously agreed they thought the shotscame from the railroad yards located just behind the Grassy Knoll. They allbegan running in that direction even before Decker’s radio order to “saturatethe area of the park, railroad and all buildings” was given.Deputy L. C. Smith, in a report made that day, told a story that was typical ofthe deputies’ experience:I was standing in front of the Sheriff’s Office on Main Street and watched thePresident and his party drive by. Just a few seconds later, I heard the firstshot, which I thought was a backfire, then the second shot and third shot rangout. I knew that this was gun shots and everyone else did also. I ran as fast asI could to Elm Street just west of Houston and I heard a woman unknown to me saythe President was shot in the head and the shots came from the fence on thenorth side of Elm. I went at [once] behind the fence and searched also in theparking area. Then came . . . word the shot was thought to have come from theTexas School Book Depository.Supporting the deputy’s stories was W. W. Mabra, then a county bailiff. Mabra,too, was on the corner of Main and Houston,so close to the President that I could almost have reached out and touched him.Then I heard the first shot. I thought it was a backfire. People ran toward theknoll. Some said they saw smoke there. I thought at first the shot may have comefrom there.Across Main Street from the deputies and Mabra stood Dallas County surveyorRobert H. West, who watched the presidential limousine move slowly toward theTriple Underpass. He heard one small report “similar to a motorcycle backfire,”then three like “rifle fire.” He said the shots came from the “northwestquadrant of Dealey Plaza [the area of the picket fence on the Grassy Knoll].”West later participated in reconstructions of the assassination for both Lifemagazine and the FBI that convinced him the crime could not have been the workof one man.Arnold and Barbara Rowland, high school students who had been married the pastMay, had come to town to see the president. They were standing on Houston Streetnear a driveway between the County Records Building and the sheriff’s office,the west side of which faces Dealey Plaza. Both of the Rowlands believed theshots came from down near the Triple Underpass despite the fact that fifteenminutes before the motorcade arrived they had remarked about seeing two men, onewith a rifle and telescopic sight, on the sixth floor of the Texas School BookDepository. Arnold Rowland had assumed the men were part of the Secret Serviceprotection.He said the man with the rifle was in the far west window of the Depository’ssixth floor while the other man, described as an elderly black man with thinhair wearing a plaid shirt, was seen in the easternmost window, the so-calledsniper’s nest window. Rowland said he lost sight of the man with the rifle asthe motorcade approached, but again saw the black man just before Kennedyarrived.During the excitement of the moment, Rowland said, he neglected to mention theblack man when he talked to authorities in the sheriff’s office. However, hesaid the next day FBI agents came to his home and got him to sign a statement.He recalled, “At that time I told them I did see the Negro man there and theytold me it didn’t have any bearing or such on the case right then. In fact, theyjust the same as told me to forget it now.”Although the agents “didn’t seem interested” in Rowland’s story of the two menon the sixth floor, they did attempt to identify the man with the gun by showingRowland photos of Oswald. However, Rowland said, “I just couldn’t identify him .. . because I just didn’t have a good enough look at his face.” The WarrenCommission brushed off Rowland’s testimony after FBI agents assured them thatRowland had mentioned nothing about the black man in his earlier statements.Commission attorney David Belin even maneuvered Mrs. Rowland into stating herhusband was “prone to exaggerate.”But Rowland’s story of seeing two men was corroborated by deputy sheriff RogerD. Craig, who said that Rowland told him about seeing two men pacing in theDepository approximately ten minutes after the assassination. Craig’sstatements, like Rowland’s, were discounted by the Commission when federalagents contradicted their testimony.However, two men also were seen by Mrs. Carolyn Walther, who worked in a dressfactory in the Dal-Tex Building. About noon, she and another employee joined thecrowd on the east side of Houston just south of Elm to watch the motorcade. Heraccount was buried in Warren Commission Exhibit 2086 in 1964 but she repeatedher story for CBS television on June 25, 1967:I had gone out on the street at about twenty after twelve to get a look at thePresident when he came by. While I waited, I glanced up at the Depositorybuilding. There were two men in the corner window on the fourth or fifth floor.One man was wearing a white shirt and had blond or light brown hair. This manhad the window open. His hands were extended outside the window. He held a riflewith the barrel pointed downward. I thought he was some kind of guard. In thesame window, right near him, was a man in a brown suit coat. Then thePresident’s car came by. I heard a gunshot. People ran. Like a fool I just stoodthere. I saw people down. I walked toward them, with the thought they maybe werehurt and I could help them. People were running toward the Grassy Knoll. A womancried out, “They shot him!” In all, I heard four shots.In a 1978 interview with Earl Golz of the Dallas Morning News, Carolyn Walther(not to be confused with Deputy Sheriff E. R. “Buddy” Walthers) made thesecomments:They (FBI) tried to make me think that what l saw were boxes. Now the boxes aremuch lighter colored. And this was definitely the shape of a person or part of aperson. I never read their report. I talked to them and it seemed like theyweren’t very interested. They were going to set out to prove me a liar, and Ihad no intention of arguing with them and being harassed. I felt like I had toldthem all I knew. And I had relieved myself of the burden of it. And if theydidn’t want to believe it or had some reason not to, well, then, that was allright with me.Steelworker Richard Randolph Carr, who was working on the seventh floor of thenew Dallas Courthouse, then under construction at the intersection of Commerceand Houston, also reported seeing a man wearing a brown coat. Carr said minutesbefore the motorcade arrived he saw a heavyset man wearing a hat, horn-rimmedglasses, and tan sport coat standing in a sixth-floor window of the Depository.After the shooting, Carr saw the man walking along Commerce Street.Ruby Henderson, standing across Elm Street from the Depository, also saw two menon an upper floor of the building. While she was uncertain whether it was thesixth floor, she saw no one above the pair. She described the shorter of the menas having a dark complexion, possibly even African American, and wearing a whiteshirt. The shorter man was wearing a dark shirt. This pair may have beenDepository employees James Jarman and Harold Norman, who watched the motorcadefrom the fifth-floor window just below the so-called sniper’s nest.Today, such stories of two men on the sixth floor of the Depository momentsbefore the shooting has since been bolstered by two films made that day. One, an8 mm home movie made by Robert Hughes, who was standing at the intersection ofMain and Houston, shows the front of the Depository just as Kennedy’s limousinepasses the building turning onto Elm. The film shows movement in both the cornerwindow of the sixth floor and the window next to it. Deep within the WarrenCommission exhibits is an FBI report acknowledging receipt of Hughes’s film. Inanother FBI document, it is claimed that the figure in the second window fromthe corner was simply a stack of boxes. No reference is made to movement.In 1975, CBS television asked Itek Corporation to look again at the Hughes film.The company concluded that there were no moving images in the double window nextto the sixth-floor corner window, a conclusion that is still disputed by variousphotographic experts.But in late 1978, a second movie surfaced that supports the two-man allegation.This film, taken by Charles L. Bronson, who was standing only a few feet west ofHughes, also shows the sixth-floor corner windows of the Depository just momentsbefore the Kennedy motorcade passed. Bronson’s film was viewed in 1963 by an FBIagent who reported that it “failed to show the building from which the shotswere fired,” thus relegating the film to obscurity. It was rediscovered in 1978when the film was mentioned in declassified FBI documents and was obtained bythe Dallas Morning News.The newspaper commissioned Robert Groden, who served as staff consultant onphotographic evidence for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, to studythe film. Groden told the newspaper:There is no question that there is movement. And, I’m sure, given time andmoney, a computer could probably clarify the images a bit more. . . . You canactually see one figure walking back and forth hurriedly. I think what washappening there is the sniper’s nest was actually being completed just prior tothe shots being fired.The House committee studied the Bronson film further and, while acknowledgingmovement in the second window, stated it was “more likely . . . a randomphotographic artifact than human movement.” However, the committee did recommendthat the film be analyzed further. There is no evidence such further study wasconducted.Another witness to the pair of men in the Depository was an inmate of the DallasCounty Jail, located just across the street to the east of the Depository.Several prisoners were in a sixth-floor cell on a level with the sixth-floorDepository window.Oddly, none of the jail inmates was ever identified or sought by federalinvestigators despite their excellent vantage point. However, one of theinmates, John L. Powell, who was in a sixth-floor cell opposite the BookDepository, told the Dallas Morning News in 1978 that the prisoners saw two men,one with a rifle, in the sixth-floor window of the Depository prior to themotorcade’s arrival. Powell even stated he could see them so clearly he saw one“fooling with the scope” on the gun. “Quite a few of us saw ‘em. Everybody wastrying to watch the parade and all that. We were looking across the streetbecause it was directly straight across. The first thing I thought is, it wassecurity guards. . . . I remember the guys,” he said, adding the pair werewearing “kind of brownish looking or duller clothes . . . like work clothes.” Healso stated “maybe more than half” of the forty inmates in his holding cell werelooking across to the Book Depository.In June 1964, Stanley M. Kaufman, one of Jack Ruby’s attorneys, mentioned toWarren Commission assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert, “It might be helpful to thecommission to know that there were people in jail who saw the actual killing.”Yet, three months later, the Commission closed shop and nothing was done. “Iremember that that did occur and it sort of concerned me at the time as towhy—if they were trying to find out all these facts—why they didn’t go up thereand talk to all those prisoners,” Kaufman told Dallas reporter Earl Golz in1978.Confirmation of the presence of two men on the sixth floor also might have comefrom Canadian journalist Norman Similas, who was in Dallas for a bottlers’convention. It was a trip he would not soon forget. On November 21, Similasphotographed and spoke with vice president Lyndon Johnson, who had addressed theconvention. Later that evening, Similas visited the Carousel Club and spent morethan an hour talking with its owner, Jack Ruby. The next day, Similas strolledover to Dealey Plaza to photograph President Kennedy’s motorcade. He stood onthe south side of Elm not ten feet from Kennedy’s car at the time of the firstshots. In a report published in the Canadian magazine Liberty, Similas said:The Presidential limousine had passed me and slowed down slightly. My camera wasdirectly angled toward the Texas School Book Depository in the background. Thepicture I took on the curb of Elm Street was trained momentarily on an open,sixth-floor window. The camera lens recorded what I could not possibly have seenat that moment—a rifle barrel extended over the windowsill. When the film wasdeveloped later, it showed two figures hovering over it.Were there two people in Similas’s photo? No one will ever know for sure. Inthat same article, he added:Upon my return to Toronto, I submitted my developed negatives to a dailynewspaper. When they were not used on Monday, November 25, I phoned and askedthat they be returned. Later I received a fat cheque in the mail, but the onenegative which clearly showed what I believe to be two figures in the window ofthe assassin’s nest was missing. When I pressed for it, I was told that thisnegative had somehow become lost. It has never been returned to me.Ronald B. Fischer, an auditor for Dallas County, and another county worker,Robert E. Edwards, were standing on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston,directly across the street from the Depository. Less than ten minutes before themotorcade arrived, Edwards commented, “Look at that guy there in that window.”Looking up, Fischer saw the head and shoulders of a man wearing a white T-shirtor possibly a light sport shirt in a southeast corner window. The man wassurrounded by boxes and was staring “transfixed,” not toward the approachingmotorcade, but in the direction of the Triple Underpass. Less than a minutelater the motorcade passed their position and both Fischer and Edwards shiftedtheir attention to the motorcade. Then Fischer heard what he thought was afirecracker followed by sounds he knew to be shots. They seemed to be comingfrom “just west of the School Book Depository building [the location of theGrassy Knoll].” They both ran toward the Grassy Knoll and forgot the man in thewindow.Hugh W. Betzner Jr. was twenty-two years old on November 22, 1963, and wastaking pictures with an old camera near the intersection of Houston and Elm.After taking Kennedy’s picture as he turned in front of the Depository, Betznerran west into Dealey Plaza following the presidential limousine. In a sheriff’sreport that day, Betzner stated:I started to wind my film again and I heard a loud noise. I thought this noisewas either a firecracker or a car had backfired. I looked up and it seemed likethere was another loud noise in a matter of a few seconds. I looked down thestreet and I could see the President’s car and another one and they looked likethe cars were stopped.Betzner said he then heard at least two more shots fired and saw the impact inthe limousine. The motorcade then sped up and Betzner joined spectators runningup the Grassy Knoll toward the wooden picket fence from where he assumed theshots had emanated. Minutes later, he looked across Elm Street and saw “policeofficers and some men in plain clothes . . . digging around in the dirt as ifthey were looking for a bullet.”Near Betzner was another photographer, Phillip Willis, a World War II veteran,who took a series of pictures considered by many as the most important photostaken of the assassination other than the Zapruder film.Willis, along with his wife and two young daughters, was in Dealey Plaza to getpictures of the president and Lyndon Johnson, whom Willis said he knewpersonally. As the presidential limousine turned onto Elm in front of theDepository, Willis snapped a photo, then ran farther west on Elm. He told theWarren Commission, “Then my next shot . . . in fact, the shot caused me tosqueeze the camera shutter, and I got a picture of the President as he was hitwith the first shot. So instantaneous, in fact, that the crowd hadn’t had timeto react.” Willis said he did not see the effects of the next shots because histwo daughters, Linda and Rosemary, were running along Elm and he becameconcerned for their safety.As a retired Air Force major, Willis said he had absolutely no doubt that theshots were from a high-powered rifle and were coming from the direction of theTexas School Book Depository. (An interesting note: Willis was in Hawaii duringthe attack on Pearl Harbor and captured the sole surviving member of a Japanesemidget submarine, thus becoming the first American to take a Japanese prisonerduring World War II.)Willis’s younger daughter, Rosemary, ran back to her father, saying, “Oh, Daddy,they have shot our president. His whole head blew up and it looked like a redhalo.”Willis said he took more photographs as “the party [the motorcade] had come to atemporary halt before proceeding on to the underpass.”In later years, this author interviewed Willis, who refuted two of the theoriesto come from federal investigations of the assassination. One, the single-bullettheory of the Warren Commission, states that one shot, identified by theCommission as the first shot, struck both Kennedy and Connally. Willis said,“There is no damn way that one bullet hit both men. That is the most stupidthing they ever stuck to—that one-bullet theory.”The House Select Committee on Assassinations, also attempting to deal with thewounds in Kennedy’s back and throat, which do not support a conclusion of oneshot from the high rear, theorized that Kennedy may have bent over momentarilywhile out of the Zapruder camera view and thus received a back wound lower thanthe throat wound. Willis retorted, “That is not right. I got the nearest, bestshot while JFK was behind the [Stemmons Freeway] sign. He was upright and wavingto the crowd. A split second later, he was grabbing at his throat.”Willis also had a comment after telling of Kennedy falling to the left rearafter the fatal head shot: “As many deer as I have shot, I’ve never known one tofall towards me.”Although the Warren Commission quoted Willis as saying that he heard threeshots, all from the Depository, Willis said:I always thought there had to be another shot from somewhere. I have always goneagainst the one-gunman theory. I always thought there had to have been somehelp. I saw blood going to the rear and left [of Kennedy]. That doesn’t happenif that bullet came from the Depository [which was behind him].Willis added:I also got a photo, taken immediately after [the shooting stopped] that showsRuby standing in front of the Depository building. He was the only person therewearing dark glasses. He was identified by people who knew him and no one elsehas been able to say it was someone else. Ruby made a big effort to show he wasin the Dallas Morning News at the time, but it wouldn’t take five minutes towalk from the News [to Dealey Plaza].Interestingly, in publishing Willis’s photo the Warren Commission cropped thepicture right through the face of the man Willis claimed was Jack Ruby. Inrecent years archivist Richard Trask argued that the man in Willis’s photo isnot Ruby. However, he failed to mention that Willis knew Ruby before theassassination and recognized him in his photo.Linda Willis, who was running along Elm Street with her sister, Rosemary, toldthis author in 1978, “I very much agree that shots came from somewhere otherthan the Depository. And where we were standing, we had a good view. So many ofthe people who have decided they know what happened there weren’t even there. Iwas, and that’s what makes the difference.” Neither Willis nor his daughtersbelieved the Warren Commission or the later House committee were seriouslytrying to find out the truth of the assassination.Behind Willis, sitting on a concrete retaining wall across the street from theDepository, was forty-five-year-old Howard Leslie Brennan, who was to become thestar witness for the Warren Commission. Brennan, who had been working as a pipefitter on a construction project behind the Depository, had eaten lunch and thentaken this position to view the motorcade. It was determined that Brennan was120 feet from the sixth-floor window. He said he saw a man in an upper floor ofthe Depository shortly before the motorcade arrived. He described the man as aslender white male in his early thirties wearing “light-colored clothing.”Brennan told the Warren Commission:I heard what I thought was a backfire. It ran in my mind that it might besomeone throwing firecrackers out of the window of the red brick building [theDepository] and I looked up at the building. I then saw this man I havedescribed in the window and he was taking aim with a high-powered rifle. I couldsee all of the barrel of the gun. I do not know if it had a scope on it or not.I was looking at the man in this window at the time of the last explosion. Thenthis man let the gun down to his side and stepped out of sight. He did not seemto be in any hurry. . . . I believe I could identify this man if I ever saw himagain.Brennan, who immediately rushed into the Depository to tell a policeman what hehad seen, apparently was one of the only witnesses to have actually seen agunman fire from the Depository. However, later that evening Brennan was unableto pick Lee Harvey Oswald out of a police lineup. Much later, it was determinedthat Brennan had poor eyesight and, in fact, a close examination of the Zapruderfilm shows that Brennan was not looking up at the time of the shooting but, asexpected, was looking toward the president’s car.Brennan’s job foreman, Sandy Speaker, told this author:They took [Brennan] off for about three weeks. I don’t know if they were SecretService or FBI, but they were federal people. He came back a nervous wreck andwithin a year his hair had turned snow white. He wouldn’t talk about [theassassination] after that. He was scared to death. They made him say what theywanted him to say.It is noteworthy that the Warren Commission so lacked confidence in Brennan’stestimony that they called him back the same day of his appearance and asked,“Have you ever worked for the Union Terminal Company in Dallas?” and “Did youever state to anyone that you heard shots from opposite the Texas School BookDepository and saw smoke and paper wadding come out of boxes on a slope belowthe railroad trestle at the time of the assassination?” When Brennan answered noto both questions, and after going off the record, the Commission lawyerdismissed him.However, Brennan’s story of a man firing from the sixth-floor window wassupported by a statement to sheriff’s deputies that day by fifteen-year-old AmosLee Euins. Euins, a schoolboy, was standing near Brennan on the south side ofthe Elm and Houston Street intersection when he heard a shot. He stated:I started looking around and then I looked up in the red brick building. I saw aman in a window with a gun and I saw him shoot twice. He then stepped backbehind some boxes. I could tell the gun was a rifle and it sounded like anautomatic rifle the way he was shooting.Euins then ran west of the Depository, where he found a policeman. He led thecop back to the Depository and told him of seeing a figure with a “bald spot”firing from an upper window.Another witness who saw a gunman in the Depository was L. R. Terry, who wasstanding across Elm Street near Brennan and Euins. In 1978, Terry told thisauthor:I was right across from that book store when Kennedy was shot. I saw a gun comeout of there just after I saw Kennedy and Connally go by. I could only see ahand, but I couldn’t tell if [the man] was right-handed or left-handed. He didnot have on a white shirt. The parade stopped right in front of the building.There was a man with him. They [investigators] could find out that the man whokilled Kennedy had somebody with him. But I don’t know who it is. . . . I justsaw the gun barrel and the hand.Across the street from Brennan, Euins, and Terry were Texas School BookDepository superintendent Roy Truly and Depository vice president Ochus V.Campbell.They had started to go off to lunch about 12:15 p.m. when they saw the crowdsand decided to wait and see the presidential motorcade. As the motorcadeapproached, they were having difficulty seeing over the heads of the crowd, sothe two men moved closer to Elm Street and a bit farther west into the plaza.Here they were joined by Mrs. Robert A. Reid, the Depository’s clericalsupervisor.The presidential limousine made such a tight turn onto Elm (nearly 120 degrees)that Truly stated he thought the right front tire came close to striking theabutment between Elm and the street in front of the Depository. The car nearlystopped, then straightened and moved into the center of three lanes to begin itsdownward glide into the plaza, they heard an “explosion . . . from west of thebuilding [the Depository].” Truly thought it was a firecracker or toy cannon. Healso said he saw the limousine stop for a second or two.When Mrs. Reid turned to Campbell and said, “Oh my goodness, I’m afraid thosecame from our building,” he replied, “Oh, Mrs. Reid, no, it came from the grassyarea down this way.”Danny G. Arce, who worked in the Depository, also was standing near Truly andCampbell. He told the Warren Commission shots “came from the railroad tracks tothe west of the Texas School Book Depository.” Truly said after the initialexplosion, everything seemed frozen. Then there were two more explosions, and herealized that shots were being fired. He saw the president’s car come to a stop.Another Depository employee saw a bullet hit the street at the time of the firstshot. Virgie Rachley (by the time of her Warren Commission testimony she hadmarried and was Mrs. Donald Baker) was a bookkeeper at the Depository. She andother workers were standing near Truly and Campbell in front of the Depositoryfacing Elm Street. She told the Warren Commission:After he passed us, then we heard a noise and I thought it was firecrackersbecause I saw a shot or something hit the pavement. . . . It looked just likeyou could see the sparks from it and I just thought it was a firecracker and Iwas thinking that . . . somebody was fixing to get in a lot of trouble and wethought the kids or whoever threw it were down below or standing near theunderpass or back up here by the sign.Mrs. Baker told Commission attorney Wesley Liebeler that the stray bullet struckthe middle of the southernmost lane on Elm Street just behind the presidentiallimousine.Truly said the crowd around him began to surge backward in panic. He becameseparated from Campbell and quickly found himself back on the steps of theDepository. Moments later a motorcycle policeman pushed past him and ran intothe Depository. Truly caught up with him in the lobby and they moved towardtheir encounter with a Depository employee—Lee Harvey Oswald.Campbell ran with many others to where he believed the shots had come from,“near the railroad tracks located over the viaduct on Elm Street.”Mary E. Woodward, a staff writer for the Dallas Morning News, had gone to DealeyPlaza with four coworkers to get a look at the president while they ate lunch.As the limousine passed, she and another writer who had seen Kennedy during thefinal weeks of the 1960 campaign commented on how relaxed and robust heappeared. Standing near the Stemmons Freeway sign located down the slope to thewest of the Depository, Woodward heard a “horrible, ear-shattering noise” comingfrom behind them and to their right [the Grassy Knoll]. She thought it was somesort of joke, a car backfiring perhaps.She saw both the president and Mrs. Kennedy look around as if they, too, hadheard the sound. The presidential limousine came to a halt. Then Woodward heardtwo more shots, coming close together, and the president slumped down in thecar. A woman nearby began weeping and cried, “They’ve shot him!” Woodward wasnever questioned by the Warren Commission.Gloria Calvery and Karen Westbrook, both employees of a publishing firm withoffices in the Depository building, had gone out during lunch to see thepresident. They were standing with others almost halfway between the corner ofElm and Houston and the Triple Underpass. Both heard the first blast and sawKennedy struck by a bullet just as the presidential limousine got directly infront of their position. Yet, in their March 1964 statements to the FBI, neitherwas simply asked about the origin of the shots nor were they asked to testify tothe Warren Commission.A. J. Millican, a coworker of Howard Brennan’s, had no difficulty in determiningwhere the shots came from. Millican told authorities that day he was standing onthe north side of Elm Street about halfway between Houston and the TripleUnderpass, which was between the Depository and the Grassy Knoll. He said henoticed “a truck from Honest Joe’s Pawn Shop” park near the Depository, thendrive off about five or ten minutes before the president arrived. He toldsheriff’s deputies:Just after the President’s car passed, I heard three shots from up toward Elmright by the Book Depository Building, and then immediately I heard two moreshots come from the arcade between the Book Store and the Underpass, then threemore shots came from the same direction only sounded further back. It soundedapproximately like a .45 automatic, or a high-powered rifle.Millican, who provided perhaps one of the clearest descriptions of the firingsequence and the location of the shots, was never interviewed by or called totestify to the Warren Commission or the House Select Committee onAssassinations. He died in 1986, apparently having never been questioned byanyone. His only testament was a sheriff’s deposition made that day.However, his supervisor, Sandy Speaker, said his entire work crew was there andthey all corroborated Millican’s story. In an interview with this author,Speaker said:I was the superintendent of construction for the Republic Bank project at thetime. Millican and also Howard Brennan were working for me. We were fabricatingplumbing piping for the Republic Bank Building under construction at the westend of Pacific Street [north of the Texas School Book Depository]. Millican andthe whole crew had knocked off for lunch and were by the Depository building towatch the parade. I hadn’t gotten there when [the motorcade] passed. I was lessthan a half-block away and heard the shots. I heard at least five shots and theycame from different locations. I was a combat Marine with the First MarineDivision in World War II, hand-to-hand combat, missions behind enemy lines, andI know what I am talking about. I’ve said for years there were more than threeshots fired.John A. Chism, along with his wife and three-year-old son, were near Millican,standing directly in front of the Stemmons Freeway sign. They said the firstshots were fired just as the president got in front of them. They saw Kennedyslump to the left and into his wife’s arms. Mrs. Chism told Dallas authoritiesthat day, “And then there was a second shot that I heard, after the President’swife had pulled him down in the seat. It came from what I thought was behind us[the Grassy Knoll] and I looked but I couldn’t see anything.”Chism also looked behind him at the sound of the shots, then saw “the motorcadebeginning to speed up.”Jean Newman was a twenty-one-year-old manufacturing company employee who came toview the motorcade in Dealey Plaza. She told sheriff’s deputies she was standingbetween the Stemmons Freeway sign and the Book Depository when the shots werefired. She stated, “The first impression I had was that the shots came from myright.” To her right was the Grassy Knoll.Also near the Stemmons Freeway sign were two of the most suspicious charactersin Dealey Plaza that day. Despite their activities and the fact that both werecaptured in several photographs made at the time, this pair was never mentionedpublicly until the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation in thelate 1970s.Two Suspicious Men [Contents.html#rsec4]About the time that Kennedy was first hit by a bullet, two men standing neareach other on the north sidewalk of Elm Street acted most strangely—one beganpumping a black umbrella while the other waved his right arm high in the air.These and subsequent actions by this pair aroused the suspicions of researchersover the years, yet the initial federal investigation ignored both men. Theiractivities are known only through analysis of assassination photographs.As Kennedy’s limousine began the gentle descent into Dealey Plaza, a man can beseen standing near the street-side edge of the Stemmons Freeway sign holding anopen umbrella. He holds the umbrella in a normal fashion and the top of theumbrella almost reaches the bottom of the sign.In photos taken minutes before Kennedy’s arrival, the umbrella is closed and,immediately after the shooting, pictures show the umbrella was closed again. Theman’s umbrella was open only during the shooting sequence. Furthermore, as seenin the Zapruder film, once Kennedy is exactly opposite the man with theumbrella, it was pumped almost two feet into the air, twirled, and then lowered.At the same time, the second man—in photos he appears to be dark complected,perhaps black or Hispanic—raised his right hand into the air, possibly making afist. This man was located on the outer edge of the Elm Street sidewalk oppositethe umbrella man, who was on the inner edge.The man with the open umbrella was the only person in Dealey Plaza with an openumbrella. Under the warm Texas sun, there was no reason to carry an openumbrella at that time.Two prominent theories have emerged concerning the “umbrella man” and hisactivities that day. Assassination researcher Robert Cutler long maintained thatthe umbrella may have been a sophisticated weapon that fired a dart or“flechette” filled with a paralyzing agent. Cutler’s theory is supported by the1975 testimony of a CIA weapons developer who told the Senate IntelligenceCommittee that just such an umbrella weapon was in the hands of the spy agencyin 1963.Charles Senseney, who developed weaponry for the CIA at Fort Detrick, Maryland,described a dart-firing weapon he developed as looking like an umbrella. He saidthe dart gun was silent in operation and fired through the webbing when theumbrella was open. Senseney said the CIA had ordered about fifty such dartweapons and that they were operational in 1963.In his 1970 book, Cutler theorized that the umbrella was used to fire aparalyzing dart into Kennedy immobilizing him for marksmen with rifles. Heclaims this theory accounts for the small puncture wound in Kennedy’s throatdescribed by Dallas doctors, but which was altered by the time of the Bethesdaautopsy. According to Cutler, this dart explains Kennedy’s lack of motion duringthe shooting sequence. Since such a weapon existed and since the actions of bothKennedy and the “umbrella man” were consistent with the operation of such aweapon, Cutler’s theory cannot be summarily dismissed. However, the use of suchan exotic and questionably effective weapon in such a momentous event stretchescredulity.Most assassination researchers prefer the alternative theory that both of thesesuspicious men may have been providing visual signals to hidden gunmen. Thistheory suggests that Kennedy was killed by a crossfire coordinated by radiomen.The two men, who were among the closest bystanders to the president when he wasfirst struck, gave signals indicating that he was not fatally hit and thereforemore shots were required.A fascinating twist on this latter theory came from researcher Gary Shaw, whosaid the two men may have been providing Kennedy with a last-second sight of whowas responsible for his death. Shaw recalled that throughout the planning of theBay of Pigs Invasion, CIA officers had promised an “umbrella” of air protectionof the Cuban invaders. This “umbrella” failed to materialize because Kennedyrefused to authorize further US military support for the invasion. According toShaw’s theory, the man with the open umbrella symbolized the promise of anair-support “umbrella” while the dark-complected man may have been one of theanti-Castro Cuban leaders known to Kennedy. Thus, in the last seconds of hislife, Kennedy may have seen the open umbrella and the face of a Cuban he knewwas involved in the Bay of Pigs and realized who was participating in his death.But this is all speculation. The existence of the “umbrella man” and thedark-complected man is fact. Even their activities after the assassination bearstudy. While virtually everyone in Dealey Plaza was moved to action by theassassination—either falling to the ground for cover or moving toward the GrassyKnoll—these two men sat down beside each other on the north sidewalk of ElmStreet.Here the dark-complected man appears to put a walkie-talkie to his mouth. In aphotograph taken by Jim Towner, what seems to be an antenna can be seen juttingout from behind the man’s head while his right hand holds some object to hisface.Several photos taken in the seconds following the assassination show both ofthese men sitting together on the Elm Street sidewalk. Moments later, the manwith the umbrella gets up, takes one last look toward the motorcade stillpassing under the Triple Underpass, and begins walking east in the direction ofthe Depository. The dark-complected man saunters toward the Triple Underpasspassing people rushing up the Grassy Knoll. He can be seen stuffing someobject—the walkie-talkie?—into the back of his pants.Despite the suspicious actions of these two men, there is no evidence that theFBI or the Warren Commission made any effort to identify or locate them.Officially they did not exist. Yet over the years, this pair became the focalpoint of criticism by private researchers. Researchers claimed the lack ofinvestigation of these men indicated the shallowness of the government probesinto the assassination.Once the House Select Committee on Assassinations was formed in the mid-1970s,researchers urged an investigation of both men. The committee finally released aphotograph of the “umbrella man” to the news media and urged anyone withknowledge of the man to come forward.Coincidentally—if it was a coincidence—the “umbrella man” suddenly wasidentified a few weeks after this national appeal. In August 1978, an anonymoustelephone caller told researcher Penn Jones Jr. that the man with the umbrellawas a former Dallas insurance salesman named Louis Steven Witt. Jones contactedsome local newsmen, including this author, and together they confronted Witt,who then was working as a warehouse manager. Witt refused to talk with newsmenbut acknowledged that he was in Dealey Plaza on the day Kennedy was killed.Jones later wrote, “I felt the man had been coached. He would answer noquestions and pointedly invited us to leave. His only positive statement, whichseemed to come very quickly, was that if subpoenaed, he was willing to appearbefore the House Select Committee on Assassinations in Washington.”Witt indeed appeared before the committee during its public testimony. His storywas comic relief compared to the intense scrutiny of witnesses like MarinaOswald and Warren Commission critics. His story was facile and improbable andwhen the umbrella that Witt claimed was the same one he had had in Dealey Plazain 1963 was displayed, it suddenly turned wrong-side out, prompting onecommittee member to quip, “I hope that’s not a weapon.”Witt told the committee that on the spur of the moment, he grabbed a large blackumbrella and went to Dealey Plaza to heckle Kennedy. He claimed that someone hadtold him that an open umbrella would rile Kennedy. While Witt offered no furtherexplanation of how his umbrella could heckle the president, committee membersspeculated that the umbrella in some way referred to the pro-German sympathiesof Kennedy’s father while serving as US ambassador to Britain just prior toWorld War II. They said the umbrella may have symbolized the appeasementpolicies of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who always carried anumbrella.According to Witt:I think I went sort of maybe halfway up the grassy area [on the north side ofElm Street], somewhere in that vicinity. I am pretty sure I sat down . . . [whenthe motorcade approached] I think I got up and started fiddling with thatumbrella trying to get it open, and at the same time I was walking forward,walking toward the street. . . . Whereas other people I understand saw thePresident shot and his movements; I did not see this because of this thing [theumbrella] in front of me. . . . My view of the car during that length of timewas blocked by the umbrella’s being open.Based on the available photographs made that day, none of Witt’s statements werean accurate account of the actions of the “umbrella man” who stood waiting forthe motorcade with his umbrella in the normal over-the-head position and thenpumped it in the air as Kennedy passed, affording him a full view of thelimousine.Witt’s bizarre story—unsubstantiated and totally at odds with the actions of theman in the photographs—resulted in few researchers accepting Louis Steven Wittas the true “umbrella man.”And there continues to be no official accounting for the dark-complected man whoappears to have been talking on a radio moments after the assassination. TheHouse committee failed to identify or locate this man and Witt claimed he had norecollection of such a person, despite photographs that seem to show the“umbrella man” talking with the dark man. Witt claimed only to recall that a“Negro man” sat down near him and kept repeating, “They done shot them folks.”Interestingly, one of the committee attorneys asked Witt specifically if herecalled seeing the man with a walkie-talkie, although officially no one hasever admitted the possibility of radios in use in Dealey Plaza.These two men remain among the mystery people of Dealey Plaza.[images/line.jpg]Meanwhile, others in the crowd continued to give accounts that differed with thelater government pronouncements. Dolores Kounas was a clerk-typist withMcGraw-Hill Publishing Company, which had offices on the third floor of theDepository building. She, along with two other McGraw-Hill employees, wasstanding just west of the Depository across Elm Street from Millican and theChisms. She, too, thought the first shot was a firecracker, but after hearing asecond shot and seeing people fall to the ground, she realized they were shots.She later told the FBI:Although I was across the street from the Depository building and was looking inthe direction of the building as the motorcade passed and following the shots, Idid not look up at the building as I had thought the shots came from a westerlydirection in the vicinity of the viaduct.Forty-four-year-old James Altgens, a photographer for the Associated Press inDallas, arrived in Dealey Plaza early. He had been assigned to get a picture ofKennedy as he passed through downtown Dallas and decided the west end of DealeyPlaza would provide an excellent opportunity to catch the president with thedowntown buildings in the background. However, when Altgens tried to stationhimself on the Triple Underpass, he was shooed away by a Dallas policeman, whotold him it was railroad property and only railroad employees were allowedthere.So Altgens walked around by the Depository, then on to the intersection of Mainand Houston, where he took a photo as the president passed. He then ran fartherinto the plaza, where he made several photographs from the south curb of Elm asthe motorcade approached from Houston.In the May 24, 1964, issue of the New York Herald Tribune magazine section,there was an article regarding Altgens’s photograph. This article raised apertinent question:Isn’t it odd that J. W. Altgens, a veteran Associated Press photographer inDallas, who took a picture of the Kennedy assassination—one of the witnessesclose enough to see the President shot and able to describe second-by-secondwhat happened—has been questioned neither by the FBI nor the Warren Commission?With this question now public, the federal government went to work. On June 2,1964, with the Warren Commission’s investigation winding down, Altgens wasfinally interviewed by FBI agents. The agents reported, “He recalled that atabout the instant he snapped the picture, he heard a burst of noise which hethought was firecrackers . . . he then turned the film in his camera . . . whenhe heard another report which he recognized as a gunshot.”Altgens elaborated:I made one picture at the time I heard a noise that sounded like a firecracker.. . . I figured it was nothing more than a firecracker because from my positiondown here the sound was not of such volume that it would indicate to me it was ahigh-velocity rifle. . . . It sounded like it was coming up from behind the car. . . who counts fireworks explosions? I wasn’t keeping track of the number ofpops that took place, but I could vouch for No. 1 and I can vouch for the lastshot, but I cannot tell you how many shots were in between. There was notanother shot fired after the President was struck in the head. That was the lastshot—that much I will say with a great degree of certainty.Despite his vantage point and his photographic background, Altgens was nevercalled to testify to the Warren Commission, which was satisfied to merely citefrom his FBI interrogation. Even then, they argued with his statement that hesnapped his camera’s shutter at the sound of the first shot, stating in theirreport that he took the picture “later than the point at which the President wasshot in the neck.”Another of Altgens’s photos was taken just seconds after the first shots werefired and showed a slender man standing in the doorway of the Depository. Manypeople, including his mother, have claimed the man was Lee Harvey Oswald. Moreon that later.Near Altgens on the grassy triangle in the lower part of Dealey Plaza were ahandful of people, all the closest witnesses to the actual assassination.Charles Brehm, along with his five-year-old son, had watched the presidentialmotorcade turn onto Houston from near the front of the Depository building.Holding his son, Brehm ran across Elm and stationed himself halfway betweenHouston and the Triple Underpass on the grassy triangle south of Elm. In a 1966film documentary, Brehm stated:I very definitely saw the effect of the second bullet that struck the President.That which appeared to be a portion of the President’s skull went flyingslightly to the rear of the President’s car and directly to its left. It did flyover toward the curb to the left and to the rear.Brehm said the piece of skull landed in the grass not far from his location. Hetold the FBI some days later that “it seemed quite apparent to him that theshots came from one of two buildings back at the corner of Elm and HoustonStreets.” He added he was not certain but “it seemed to him that the automobilealmost came to a halt after the first shot.”Brehm, an ex-serviceman with experience in bolt-action rifles, was probably theclosest witness to the fatal head shot. He was not called to testify to theWarren Commission. But he continued to tell his story over the years, evenappearing at Dallas events concerning the assassination.Two significant home movies were made of the assassination, one by MariaMuchmore, who had moved from a position near Main and Houston to the center ofthe grassy triangle behind Brehm. She caught on film the final and fatal headshot to Kennedy and the disappearance of the limousine into the TripleUnderpass.Further behind Muchmore, across Main Street, Orville Nix captured the entireassassination sequence. It is the Nix film that most clearly shows thepresidential limousine coming to a brief halt with its brake lights on prior tothe fatal head shot. Also in the Nix film are suspicious flashes of light on theGrassy Knoll, which is in the background. Are these muzzle flashes from rifles?To date, no sophisticated analysis has been conducted.Nix was interviewed by an assassination researcher some years later and askedabout the direction of the shots. He stated, “I thought it [shots] came from afence between the Book Depository and the railroad tracks.”Nix also said that he later talked about the assassination with a friend,Forrest V. Sorrels, then head of the Dallas Secret Service office. He said atthe time of the assassination, Sorrels, too, believed shots had come from thepicket fence on the Grassy Knoll.The Warren Commission never called Nix to testify, although he indicated he waswilling to do so to the FBI, nor did the Commission have his film adequatelyanalyzed. Only after some researchers claimed that photographs of a gunman onthe Grassy Knoll were visible in the Nix film was it closely studied. In late1966, Itek Corporation, which handles government contracts and is closely tiedto the CIA, studied the film on the request of United Press International. Itekscientists concluded that the gunman figure was actually shadows from a treebranch.It might be noted that even this conclusion is not totally accepted bysuspicious researchers since, moments later, Nix panned back over the same areaand the “shadow” figure is no longer visible. If the figure was merely shadows,it would seem that they should still be there in the later frames. When asked ifthe film the government returned to him was his original, Nix later responded,“I would say no . . . some of the frames were missing . . . some were ruined.”Only a couple of the witnesses from the center grassy area testified to theWarren Commission, and one of the best witnesses was never identified untilyears later when she was interviewed by an assassination researcher.Also taking films on the south side of Elm Street was a woman who stood filmingright behind Brehm and his son. From this vantage point, her movie would shownot only the Grassy Knoll in the background, but also the Texas School BookDepository at the time of the shooting.Despite the most intensive FBI investigation in history, federal authoritiesofficially were unable to locate the woman and, for years, she was known toresearchers only as the “babushka lady” because of a triangular kerchief shewore on her head that day.The Babushka Lady [Contents.html#rsec5]Perhaps the reason the federal authorities were unable to identify or locate the“babushka lady” is the explosive story she had to tell.Located many years later by researcher Gary Shaw, Beverly Oliver, by thenmarried to an evangelist and a “reborn” Christian, said she was nineteen yearsold at the time of the assassination and worked as a singer for the Colony Club,a strip-show club located next door to Jack Ruby’s Carousel Club.On November 22, she took a prototype Super-8 Yashica movie camera to DealeyPlaza and ended up just behind Charles Brehm on the grassy triangle just southof Elm Street. The camera was a gift from a friend who had access to new cameratechnology.Photos taken that day show that Oliver filmed the entire assassination as themotorcade moved down Elm. Undoubtedly her film would have included the windowsof the Texas School Book Depository as shots were fired, clear pictures of the“umbrella man” and the “dark-complected man” on the north side of Elm, and theGrassy Knoll area at the time of the fatal head shot.Oliver said that on Monday following the assassination, she was approached bytwo men as she neared the Colony Club. She believed they were either FBI orSecret Service agents. They said they knew she had taken film in Dealey Plazaand wanted to develop it for use as evidence. Oliver was told her film would bereturned to her within ten days. She complied.She never saw her film again. There was no mention of either her or her film inthe Warren Report.Years later, when shown photographs of FBI agents involved in the assassination,Oliver identified Regis Kennedy as one of the men who took her film. Kennedyplayed a key role in the New Orleans aspect of the assassination investigationand came under suspicion in later years because of his insistence that NewOrleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello was merely a “tomato salesman.”Not long after the assassination, Oliver married George McGann, a Dallasunderworld character whose best man was Russell D. Matthews. Matthews, a closefriend of Jack Ruby, was described by the House Select Committee onAssassinations as “actively engaged in criminal activity since the 1940s.”The committee also developed evidence connecting Matthews with associates ofFlorida Mafia chieftain Santos Trafficante. Further, Matthews was a fatherfigure to another Dallas thug, convicted murderer-for-hire Charles V. Harrelson,the father of film star Woody Harrelson.Oliver revealed that during the presidential campaign of 1968, she and McGannhad a two-hour conversation with candidate Richard Nixon in a Miami hotel. Whyformer president Nixon would meet with a well-known criminal is unclear, but inlight of information that has been made public since the Watergate affairlinking Nixon to organized-crime figures, this story no longer seems sofar-fetched.In 1970, McGann was killed in a gangland-style slaying in west Texas.Oliver also said that two weeks prior to the Kennedy assassination, she wasvisiting in Ruby’s club. There she met a man Ruby introduced as “Lee Oswald ofthe CIA.” She later recognized Oswald when his picture was broadcast followingthe assassination. She also met David Ferrie in Ruby’s club in late 1963. “Infact, he was there so often, I mistook him as the assistant manager of theCarousel Club,” she told this author.A friend of Oliver’s also knew of Oswald’s being in Ruby’s club and spoke openlyabout it. According to Oliver, her friend disappeared and she “decided it wouldbe in her best interests not to say anything.” She remained quiet until themid-1970s, when she was located and interviewed by Shaw and, later, by Texasnewsmen.Although Beverly Oliver was the object of a secret briefing by Commissionattorney Robert Tannenbaum on March 17, 1977, and a transcript of this briefingwas accidentally leaked to the news media, there is no mention of her or herfilm in the committee’s report.Obviously it is highly suspicious to researchers that one of the closestwitnesses to the assassination and a witness who claimed to have been with bothRuby and Oswald prior to November 22, 1963, was never located or identified byfederal authorities. Not to mention that when a report was prepared, it was notreleased to the public.Oliver continued to share her story through 2013. The details were published inher 1994 book, Nightmare in Dallas. Largely due to her hesitation in goingpublic for so many years, a concerted effort appeared to have been mounted todiscredit her. Other than simply voicing disbelief, most accusations were basedon flimsy arguments, such as one that claimed the shoes depicted on the personin the Dealey Plaza photographs appeared too small to fit the older and largerOliver. However, until someone with better credentials and a convincing storycomes forth, most researchers accept Beverly Oliver as the “babushka lady.”[images/line.jpg]A few feet to the west of Oliver on the center grassy slope were two importantwitnesses: Mary Moorman, who took a photograph at the moment of the fatal headshot that may have pictured the gunman on the Grassy Knoll, and her friend JeanHill, who, like Willis, claimed to have seen Jack Ruby in front of the TexasSchool Book Depository at the time of the shooting.Ironically, neither Moorman nor Hill, probably the closest witnesses to thefatal head shot other than Brehm, were there simply to see Kennedy. Both womenhad come to Dealey Plaza to take pictures of Dallas police motorcycle officersthey fancied. Hill had just moved to Dallas from Oklahoma and Moorman wasshowing her the city, as well as trying to get her a date with one of thepolicemen escorting the motorcade.The women were stopped by a policeman at the corner of Elm and Houston andinitially prevented from entering the grassy triangle in the center of theplaza. However, after some flirting, the officer allowed them through and theytook up a position on the south side of Elm midway between Houston and theTriple Underpass.Hill, who said she was getting in a “cops and robbers frame of mind” hoping todate the policeman, noticed that a van with writing on it saying UNCLE JOE’SPAWN SHOP was allowed through the police lines and drove in front of theDepository and behind the concrete pergola on top of the Grassy Knoll. Shethought this was suspicious since no one else had been allowed into that shortstreet in front of the Depository. She jokingly said to Moorman, “Do you supposethere are murderers in that van?”As the presidential motorcade turned onto Elm, Moorman began taking snapshotswith a Polaroid camera and handing the photos to Hill, who applied fixative andput them in the pocket of her red-cloth raincoat.Hill said Kennedy was smiling and waving to a crowd of people on the north sideof Elm. She told this author:I knew he’d never look our way because all the people were on the other side ofthe street, so I jumped out into the street and yelled, “Hey, Mr. President,look this way. We want to take your picture.” As he began turning toward us, hewas hit. Then a bullet hit his head and took the top off. Mary fell to theground and shouted, “Get down, they’re shooting!” But being young and dumb, Ikept standing for a minute trying to see where the shots came from. It waseerie. Everything seemed frozen. I saw a man fire from behind the wooden fence.I saw a puff of smoke and some sort of movement on the Grassy Knoll where hewas. [She later pinpointed this location as about fifteen feet north of theeastern corner of the wooden picket fence—the exact location of a figurediscovered in Moorman’s photograph.] Then I saw a man walking briskly in frontof the Texas School Book Depository. He was the only person moving. Everybodyelse seemed to be frozen with shock. Because of my earlier thoughts, I becamesuspicious of this man and thought he might be connected with that truck I saw.Hill said she heard between four and six shots altogether and then ran acrossthe street in an effort to locate the men she had seen. She didn’t find them,but she claimed that on the following Sunday morning she recognized TV photos ofJack Ruby as the man she had seen in front of the Depository. Minutes after theshooting, Hill said she was standing just west of the Depository when she wastaken into custody by two men who identified themselves as Secret Serviceagents.Meanwhile, a Dallas reporter had talked with Moorman and taken her to thesheriff’s office. Here she was later joined by Hill, who said their photographshad been taken by federal authorities.Directly across Elm from Hill and Moorman was the Newman family. Bill Newman,his wife, Gayle, and their two small children were standing west of the StemmonsFreeway sign directly below the Grassy Knoll. Newman told sheriff’s officers:We were standing at the edge of the curb looking at the [president’s] car as itwas coming toward us and all of a sudden there was a noise, apparently agunshot. . . . By [the] time he was directly in front of us . . . he was hit inthe side of the head. . . . Then we fell down on the grass as it seemed that wewere in direct path of fire. . . . I thought the shot had come from the gardendirectly behind me, that was an elevation from where I was as I was right on thecurb. I do not recall looking toward the Texas School Book Depository. I lookedback in the vicinity of the garden.Later that day during a local television interview, Newman was apparently thefirst person to publicly speak of the Grassy Knoll. When asked where the shotshad come from, Newman responded, “Back up on the, uh, knoll . . . what you callit.” UPI reporter Merriman Smith, in a dispatch sent only twenty-five minutesfollowing the shooting, noted, “Some of the Secret Service agents thought thegunfire was from an automatic weapon fired to the right rear of the president’scar, probably from a grassy knoll to which police rushed.”Another witness, far above the crowd in Dealey Plaza, had a bird’s-eye view ofthe assassination. Jesse C. Price was the building engineer for the UnionTerminal Annex, which is the southern counterpart of the Texas School BookDepository. The building stands at the corner of Houston and Commerce. Pricesaid he went up on the roof to get “a better view of the caravan.” While sittingon the edge of the building’s roof overlooking the plaza, Price heard shots“from by the . . . Triple Underpass.”In an affidavit signed that day, Price stated, “There was a volley of shots, Ithink five and then much later . . . another one.” He said the shots seemed tocome from “just behind the picket fence where it joins the underpass.”Price also said he saw a man, described as young, wearing a white dress shirt,no tie, and khaki-colored pants, running behind the wooden picket fence “towardsthe passenger cars on the railroad siding” with something in his hand that“could have been a gun.”Price was never called to testify to the Warren Commission. In fact, it shouldbe noted that many of the closest and most critical witnesses were never queriedby the Warren Commission. And those who were can be forgiven for not providingany useful information. For example, on April 3, 1964, statements given to theFBI by seventy-three Depository employees were given to the Warren Commission byFBI director J. Edgar Hoover. These statements were all given in late March1964, a time in which every citizen had been conditioned for nearly four monthsto the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin and that only threeshots came from the sixth floor of the Depository. Adding to thispredetermination by both government and mass media were rumors alreadycirculating in Dallas that it might be unhealthy to contradict the officialgovernment position on the assassination. Incredibly, virtually none of thewitnesses were questioned as to their opinion of the origin of the shots or evenhow many shots were fired. In fact, for the most part, they read likepre-prepared statements simply signed by the participants, none of whom werewilling to challenge federal authorities.Even in the face of contradictions in evidence and testimony by those in DealeyPlaza, one fact seems inescapable—most of the witnesses in the crowd believedshots came from the Grassy Knoll area.However, it is also certain that at least one or more shots were fired from thedirection of the redbrick building at the northwest corner of Elm andHouston—the Texas School Book Depository.The Texas School Book Depository [Contents.html#rsec6]Overlooking Dealey Plaza at its northeast corner is the seven-story redbrickbuilding that in 1963 housed the Texas School Book Depository. It had little todo with Texas public schools.The Depository was a private company that acted as an agent for a number of bookpublishers, furnishing office space and providing warehousing, inventorying, andshipping.School systems would place orders with the publishers for textbooks and thepublishers would send the orders along to the Depository, where about a halfdozen young men acted as order fillers—locating and collecting the books as pereach order.On November 22, 1963, one of these order fillers was Lee Harvey Oswald.Oswald and his wife, Marina, had separated at the time he left for New Orleansin the spring of 1963. They reunited in that Louisiana city, but in September,it was decided that since Marina was about to have a baby, she would return toTexas with a friend, Ruth Paine, while Oswald continued his activities—whichreportedly included a trip to Mexico City.When Oswald arrived back in Dallas on October 3, Marina was living in Irving, asuburban city west of Dallas. She was staying in the home of Michael and RuthPaine—they, too, were separated at the time—and over the weekend of October12–13, Oswald had arrived there to visit. During this weekend, Mrs. Paine saidshe gave Oswald, who had no driver’s license, a driving lesson in her car.About a week before, Oswald allegedly had returned from his trip to Mexico City.However, there continues to be much controversy concerning this journey.On Monday, October 14, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald to Dallas, where he rented a roomat 1026 N. Beckley Avenue from Mrs. A. C. Johnson for $8 a week. Oswald hadfilled out applications at the Texas Employment Commission and reportedly waslooking for work.That same day, Mrs. Paine mentioned Oswald—and the fact that he needed workbecause his wife was about to have another baby—to neighbors, including Mrs.Linnie Mae Randle. Mrs. Randle mentioned that Wesley Frazier, a younger brotherwho lived with her, worked at the Texas School Book Depository and that a jobmight be available there. Marina Oswald, who was present at this gathering,reportedly urged Mrs. Paine to check into the job possibility. Mrs. Paine agreedand called Depository superintendent Roy Truly that very day.Before the Warren Commission, Truly recalled getting a call from a woman inIrving who said she knew a man whose wife was going to have a baby and needed ajob. Truly agreed to talk with the man.Mrs. Paine mentioned her call to Oswald later that evening and the next day,October 15, Oswald interviewed with Truly for the job. Oswald began working astemporary help the next day. Truly said the fall was their busiest time of year.Plus more hands were needed as the flooring on the sixth floor was being torn upand replaced. Truly told the commission:Actually, [it was] the end of our fall rush—if it hadn’t existed a week or twolonger [than usual], or if we had not been using some of our regular boysputting down this plywood, we would not have had any need for Lee Oswald at thattime, which is a tragic thing for me to think about.Oswald was paid $1.25 an hour to fill book orders. Once shown the procedures, heworked on his own. Truly described Oswald as “a bit above average” as anemployee. Coworkers said Oswald was pleasant enough but kept mostly to himself.During his first week at work, Oswald got acquainted with Frazier and soon askedFrazier to drive him to Irving to visit his family. Frazier, who had onlystarted working at the Depository the month before, said he was eager to makefriends in Dallas. So Frazier agreed and, in fact, gave Oswald a ride to Irvingevery weekend prior to the assassination—except one when Oswald told Frazier hewas staying in Dallas to take a driving test.On Sunday, November 17, Marina Oswald had Mrs. Paine call a Dallas telephonenumber Oswald had given her. When she asked for Lee Oswald, Mrs. Paine was toldthere was nobody there by that name. The next day, Oswald called the Paine homeand angrily told Marina he was using a fictitious name at the Beckley Avenueaddress and not to call him there.On Thursday morning, November 21, Oswald reportedly asked Frazier to drive himto Irving after work because he wanted to get some curtain rods to put in hisBeckley Avenue apartment. According to this curtain rod story—only Frazier andhis sister claimed to have seen Oswald with a package and their descriptionswere inconsistent and vague—the next morning Frazier’s sister saw Oswald place apaper-wrapped package in Frazier’s car and Frazier noticed the packet as thepair drove to work. Frazier later said Oswald told him it was the curtain rods.Oswald also said he would not be riding back to Irving as usual, but he gave noexplanation. Frazier said once at the Depository, Oswald got out of the car andwalked ahead into the building carrying his package with one end cupped in hisright hand and the other tucked under his right arm, parallel to his body. Mostresearchers who have studied the Mannlicher-Carcano (technically merely aCarcano carbine) state that, even disassembled, the barrel is too long to carryin this position.When Frazier entered the building, he could not see Oswald and never knew whatbecame of the package. Many researchers believe the curtain rod story wasconcocted by authorities later in an attempt to explain how Oswald got a rifleinto the Depository. Some researchers suspect Frazier, who could have beencharged with being an accessory to the assassination, was susceptible to beingcoached by authorities. Furthermore, photographs made of Oswald’s Beckley Avenueroom that weekend clearly show curtains in place, obviating any need for curtainrods. When questioned by the authorities on what he had taken into theDepository, Oswald denied the curtain rod story, saying he only carried hislunch to work.Jack Dougherty, another Depository employee whose Warren Commission testimonyappears somewhat incoherent, nevertheless said, “Yes, I saw [Oswald] when hefirst came in the door.” Commission attorney Joseph Ball asked, “Did he haveanything in his hands or arms?” “Well, not that I could see of,” was theresponse.Many Depository employees saw Oswald that morning. He appeared to be carrying onnormal work duties, particularly on the sixth floor, where he was assigned thatday.Frazier said he never saw Oswald after noon. He told the Warren Commission thatas the presidential motorcade approached, he joined other Depository employeeswho were standing on the steps of the building facing Elm.Minutes before the presidential motorcade arrived, an odd incident occurred thathas puzzled researchers for years.The Distracting Seizure [Contents.html#rsec7]About 12:15 p.m., a young man described as wearing green Army fatigues collapsedat 100 N. Houston, near the front door of the Texas School Book Depository. Heapparently suffered some sort of seizure. Dallas policeman D. V. Harknessradioed the police dispatcher to send an ambulance to that location at 12:18p.m. Radio logs showed that the ambulance, after picking up the victim, radioed,“We are en route to Parkland.” However, Parkland never recorded a patientregistering at this time, and the entire incident seemed forgotten.Despite the suspicious timing and proximity to the assassination, there is nomention of this incident in the Warren Commission Report and the FBI didn’t getaround to investigating it until May 1964.And this investigation took place only after a former employee of O’Neal FuneralHome, apparently more curious about the incident than the FBI, called thebureau’s Dallas office to report the incident, adding the patient “disappeared”after arriving at Parkland. The O’Neal caller stated he “felt it possible thatthis incident may have been planned to distract attention from the shooting thatwas to follow.”The FBI detailed their investigation of the matter in Commission Document 1245,which was not included in the Warren Report or its twenty-six volumes.Agents contacted the ambulance driver, Aubrey Rike, who said he had picked up aman “who was conscious and only slightly injured with a facial laceration.” Rikeadded that in the confusion at Parkland, this man had simply walked off. Rikealso said a Secret Service agent at Parkland told him to remain there “becausethey might need [his ambulance] to move the President to another location.” Itwas Rike who later helped load the president’s body into his ambulance for thesad return to Love Field.On May 26, Bureau agents located the “victim” after finding his name in O’Nealrecords. Jerry B. Belknap had paid his $12.50 ambulance charge back on December2, 1963. Based on a later FBI report and an interview with Belknap byassassination researcher Jerry D. Rose, the following story came to light:Belknap said he had suffered from seizures since being struck by a car whilegetting off a school bus as a child. He was standing near the Depository when hestepped back from the crowd and lost consciousness. He said the next thing heknew, a policeman was standing over him.Once at Parkland, he was sitting on a small table and, after asking forattention, was told to lie down. He said that a short time later there was agreat rush of people who went into a different section of the emergency room.This was the Kennedy party with the stricken president.Belknap said a male attendant finally brought him some water and an aspirin butthat, after realizing that he was not going to get immediate treatment, hewalked out without registering. Amazingly, his exit was accomplished under thenoses of security agents who were locking down the hospital. Outside, Belknapcaught a bus back downtown, where he first learned of the assassination.Intriguingly, Belknap told Rose that he had been interviewed by both Dallaspolice and the FBI within days of the assassination, months before the FBI’sreported investigation in May 1964. He commented that the two police agenciesapparently distrusted each other and both asked him the same questions. Askedabout the June 1964 FBI report concerning him, Belknap offered the explanationthat perhaps an agent had called him on the phone and simply confirmed theresults of the earlier interview. Belknap also stated in 1983 that aninvestigator from “some committee in Washington” had contacted him within thepast few years. However, if this investigator was with the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations, there is no reference to him in its report orattendant volumes.Belknap died in 1986.The entire “seizure” episode is strange and full of contradictions andcoincidence—Belknap even reported seeing Jack Ruby once “acting like a bigshot.” Belknap also said he lost consciousness at the scene, while the FBIreport said he didn’t.Researchers view the incident as either a strangely convenient coincidence or assome as-yet-undiscovered plot to distract police and bystanders while assassinsmoved into position just prior to Kennedy’s arrival in Dealey Plaza.Ambulance driver Rike, who died in April 2010, told this author he felt theincident was suspicious because he personally had been summoned to that samelocation on false calls several times in the days leading up to theassassination. In fact, there may have been more than a dozen such fake calls, afact not immediately noticed as they were spaced over separate shifts ofdrivers. All requested an ambulance be sent to the corner of Elm and Houston.“We would get these calls for service and I would run up there to the area bythe School Book Depository but there would be no one there. This happened up totwelve times in the two weeks preceding the assassination,” said Rike. “Itseemed like someone was timing how long it took for an ambulance to get there.”Rike pointed out that the Kennedy motorcade was running about five minutes late,which meant if it had been on time, it would have arrived at Elm and Houstonsimultaneously with his ambulance. Speculation was that this would havecongested the intersection, causing the Kennedy limousine to stop, making thepresident a stationary target.Researchers agree the incident deserves further investigation, particularly inlight of the fact that Rike and Dennis McGuire, the ambulance drivers who tookBelknap to Parkland, remained there to load Kennedy’s body for the return tripto Love Field that fateful afternoon.[images/line.jpg]One Depository employee who felt strongly that shots had originated from withinthe building was Geneva L. Hine, who operated the Depository’s credit desk onthe second floor. She told the Warren Commission she had seen President Kennedybefore and offered to answer the telephones while some of the office women couldgo outside to view the motorcade. By herself, Hine watched the president’s carturn from Houston onto Elm. Suddenly, she said, she heard three shots that“sounded like cannon shots, they were so terrific.” They caused the building toshake and appeared to come from within the building, she said.But the most curious aspect to Hine’s statement was the cause of her leaving thetelephones and venturing to the window. “I was alone until the lights all wentout and the phones became dead because the motorcade was coming near us and noone was calling so I got up and thought I could see it from the east window inour office.”The lights all went out and the phones went dead just as Kennedy’s motorcadeapproached the Depository? There was no other blackout in any other part ofDallas. This most suspicious happenstance did not prompt any follow-up questionsfrom Commission attorneys Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, who merely went onto ask Hine what she saw out the window.At the time of the shooting, most persons within the Depository believed theshots came from elsewhere.Steven F. Wilson was vice president of a school textbook–publishing company andhad an office on the third floor of the Depository. Wilson told the FBI hewatched the motorcade go by from a closed third-floor window but lost sight ofthe president when he “became obscured by some trees which are on Elm Street.”He further stated:In a matter of ten seconds or less . . . I heard three shots . . . there was agreater space of time between the second and third shots than between the firstand second. The three shots were fired within a matter of less than fiveseconds. The shots sounded to me like rifle shots. At that time, it seemed likethe shots came from the west end of the building or from the colonnade locatedon Elm Street across from the west end of our building [the pergola on theGrassy Knoll]. The shots really did not sound like they came from above me.Elsie Dorman, who worked for Scott-Foresman Co., was in her fourth-floor officefilming the presidential motorcade as it moved toward her on Houston. The onlyfilm made from the Depository, hers was of poor quality and did not capture theassassination. With her were fellow workers Dorothy Ann Garner, Victoria Adams,and Sandra Styles. Garner told the FBI, “I thought at the time the shots orreports came from a point to the west of the building.” Adams told the WarrenCommission:We heard a shot, and it was a pause, and then a second shot, and then a thirdshot. It sounded like a firecracker or a cannon at a football game, it seems asif it came from the right below [the area of the Grassy Knoll] rather than fromthe left above [the sixth-floor window].Styles told Bureau agents she could not tell where the shots came from, but thatshe and Adams immediately “left the office at this time, went down the backstairs, and left the building at the back door.” Wesley Frazier, who had drivenOswald to work that morning, was on the front steps of the Depository. He toldthe Warren Commission of his experience:Right after he [Kennedy] went by . . . I heard a sound and if you have ever beenaround motorcycles you know how they backfire, and so I thought one of themmotorcycles backfired because right before his car came down, now there wereseveral of these motorcycle policemen, and they took off down toward theunderpass down there. . . . I heard two more of the same type, you know, sounds,and by that time people were running everywhere and falling down and screaming.. . . I figured it was somebody shooting at President Kennedy . . . and fromwhere I was standing it sounded like it was coming from down [at the] railroadtracks there. . . . So, we started back into the building and it wasn’t but justa few minutes that there were a lot of police officers and so forth all over thebuilding there.Frazier said one of the Depository employees with him on the steps of thebuilding as Kennedy passed by was Billy Nolan Lovelady, who was to becomewell-known to researchers as “the man in the doorway.”The Man in the Doorway [Contents.html#rsec8]Associated Press photographer James Altgens snapped a picture seconds afterKennedy was first struck by a bullet. In the background of this photo a man canbe seen standing in the west corner of the Texas School Book Depository’s frontdoorway.Soon after the assassination, many people—including his mother—suggested the manin the doorway looked amazingly like Lee Harvey Oswald. Obviously, if the man inthe photo was Oswald, he could not have been firing a rifle on the sixth floor.Controversy over this issue has continued to roil since the time of theassassination. In 2012 a group of researchers, including McKnight Universityprofessor emeritus James H. Fetzer, retired University of Wisconsin–StevensPoint history professor David Wrone, and health specialist Ralph C. Cinque,began an “Oswald Innocence Campaign” based primarily on the photo of the man inthe doorway, who they said “clearly evident upon close examination” was LeeOswald.The Warren Commission, based primarily on testimony from Depository employees,concluded the man in the doorway was Billy Lovelady. After being interviewed atlength by the FBI, Lovelady identified the man in the photo as himself.Lovelady, who had worked at the Depository since 1961, was one of the menassigned to lay plywood flooring on the sixth floor that day. He said that about11:50 a.m. he and other employees stopped work so they could clean up beforetaking their lunch break. Lovelady said the workers took both of theDepository’s two elevators and were racing each other down to ground level. Herecalled hearing Oswald shout to them to wait or to send an elevator back forhim.After buying a soft drink, Lovelady told the Warren Commission, he went out themain door and sat on the steps of the Depository to eat his lunch with somecoworkers. Lovelady said he remained there as the motorcade passed by, and thenheard some noises. “I thought it was firecrackers or somebody celebrating thearrival of the President. It didn’t occur to me at first what had happened untilthis Gloria [Calvery] came running up to us and told us the President had beenshot,” he recalled.Asked where he thought the shots came from, Lovelady replied, “Right therearound that concrete little deal on that knoll.” Lovelady, along with fellowDepository employees, joined the throng of people rushing toward the GrassyKnoll, but said a short time later he returned to the Depository, enteringthrough a back door unchallenged.William Shelley, Depository manager and Oswald’s immediate supervisor,acknowledged that Lovelady was on the steps of the building when Kennedy passedby. He told the Warren Commission he heard “something sounded like it was afirecracker and a slight pause and then two more a little bit closer together.”He too said the shots sounded like they came from west of the Depository.Additionally, Wesley Frazier and a Depository clerk, Sarah Stanton, both signedstatements averring they were with Shelley and Lovelady on the Depository stepsat the time of the shooting.That should have been the end of questions concerning the identity of the man inthe doorway. However, on February 29, 1964, the FBI interviewed Lovelady andphotographed him wearing a short-sleeved shirt with vertical stripes, totallyunlike the dark, mottled long-sleeved shirt worn by the man in the Altgenspicture.Later Lovelady explained the discrepancies in the shirts by telling CBS News,“Well, when the FBI took [my picture] in the shirt, I told them it wasn’t thesame shirt.”The shirt Lovelady was wearing that day—and subsequently tried to sell for alarge sum of money—was a broad plaid, which he said was buttoned at the neck.The man in the doorway photo appears to be wearing a dark mottled shirt open tothe navel with a white T-shirt underneath, exactly what Oswald was wearing whenarrested less than an hour and a half later.And even Dallas police chief Jesse Curry seemed to continue to question theidentity of the man in the doorway. In his 1969 book, Curry compared photos ofthe doorway man with Oswald and merely commented, “The Warren Commissionattempted to prove that the man was Billy N. Lovelady who worked at thedepository.”The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) considered this issue indepth. They had anthropologists study the features of the man in the photographand the committee received photographic analyses of the man’s shirt. Thecommittee concluded “that it is highly improbable that the man in the doorwaywas Oswald and highly probable that he was Lovelady.” But this probability didnot end the controversy. Skeptics noted that the HSCA Report never mentionedthat the man in the doorway wore his shirt open to the navel. Pictures ofLovelady taken that day showed his shirt buttoned to the neck.Most researchers today accept that Lovelady was the man in the doorway. Museumcurator and archivist Richard B. Trask, in his monumental 1994 book onassassination photographic evidence, Pictures of the Pain, wrote aboutreenactment photos of Lovelady shot on the Depository steps in 1971. He noted,“At a distance of eight years from the original event, it was still readilyevident that Lovelady was one and the same in both the 1963 and 1971 photos.”But the controversy continued when in 2013 researchers with the Oswald InnocenceCampaign claimed the Altgens photo, particularly the area within the Depositorydoorway, had been altered. As will be seen, this is not the only allegation ofphotographic alteration in the assassination case. However, these researchersfocus primarily on the clothing worn by both Oswald and Lovelady. David Wronepointed out that the collars of the two shirts “furl” differently, with Oswald’sassuming the look of a false lapel. They said by proving that the man in thedoorway could not be Lovelady, it appeared by default that it was Oswald.Adding to the controversy, in 2007 the Assassination Records Review Boardreleased handwritten notes by Dallas Police homicide captain Will Fritz madeduring his initial interrogation of Oswald on the day of the assassination.Fritz noted Oswald told him he had gone “to 1st floor [and] had lunch” and thenwas “out with Bill Shelley in front.” Oswald said it was Shelley, his immediateboss, who told him to go home, as there would be no more work that day, althoughShelley denied even seeing Oswald any time after the shooting. Most Depositoryemployees indeed had left the building by about 2 p.m. after being told therewould be no more work that day. Shelley also made it clear that after theshooting he and Lovelady moved toward the railroad tracks and finally reenteredthe Depository through the rear door. So if Oswald did indeed encounter Shelley,it would have had to be prior to or during the assassination and not afterward.“The ‘Doorman’ was Oswald, and there is no doubt about it,” argued Ralph Cinque,administrator of the Oswald Innocence Campaign website. “He is wearing Oswald’sclothes—to a tee. He has got Oswald’s build and even Oswald’s mannerisms. Andthe whole case for Lovelady never made a lick of sense, relying as it does onphony pictures, phony movies, and, in a word: lies.”Since Lovelady said he was sitting on the steps and the man in the photo isstanding, peering around the edge of the front-door alcove, and since the FBIdid such a dismal job of proving it was Lovelady, coupled with claims ofalterations to the Altgens photo, suspicion still lingers about the identity ofthe man in the doorway.While many researchers today are ready to concede that the man may have beenLovelady, there is a growing resistance to this admission. And the stakes arehigh. If it can ever be conclusively demonstrated that the man in the Depositorydoorway is Lee Oswald, the case for his committing the crime six floors abovecompletely falls apart.[images/line.jpg]But if the man in the doorway was not Oswald, then where was he? Was he on thesixth floor firing the Carcano, just as two federal panels have concluded?Despite the years of confident statements by federal authorities, no one hasunquestionably placed Oswald on the sixth floor at the time of the shooting.In later years Dallas police chief Jesse Curry admitted to newsmen, “We don’thave any proof that Oswald fired the rifle, and never did. Nobody’s yet beenable to put him in that building with a gun in his hand.”When asked where he was at the time of the shooting, Oswald told Dallas policehe was eating lunch on the first floor of the Depository in what was called the“domino room” at the time of the assassination, and there is some evidence toback up his statement.Bonnie Ray Williams was one of the Depository workers who were laying plywoodflooring on the sixth floor that day. During the elevator race to the firstfloor a few minutes before noon, Williams said, he heard Oswald call, “Guys, howabout an elevator?” from either the fifth or sixth floor. Oswald also apparentlyasked them to send an elevator back up to him.Williams told the Warren Commission he thought the others planned to gather onthe sixth floor to watch the motorcade, so he returned there with his lunch,consisting of chicken, bread, and a bag of chips in a brown paper sack alongwith a soft drink. Williams said he sat on some boxes near a window facing outonto Elm Street and ate his lunch. He said he saw no one else on the sixthfloor, which was one large open area. However, he noted stacks of book cartonshere and there. Becoming impatient because no other workers had joined him,Williams threw down the remains of his lunch and left the sixth floor at“approximately 12:20.” Since the presidential motorcade was runningapproximately five minutes late, this means there was no one in the sixth-floorwindow at the time Kennedy should have arrived in the street below. In a January14, 1964, FBI report, agents quoted Williams as saying he left the sixth floorafter about three minutes. However, Williams denied ever saying that and it isreasonable that he couldn’t have eaten his lunch in only three minutes.At the time, the news media made a great deal of comment about the chicken bonesand lunch sack found on the sixth floor. Many people thought this proved that acold and calculating assassin had patiently eaten his lunch while waiting forKennedy to arrive.Going down one of the elevators, Williams saw two other workers, Harold Normanand James Jarman, on the fifth floor and joined them to watch the motorcade.Williams and Norman were captured in a photograph taken that day as they leanedout of the fifth-floor window directly below the famous sixth-floor “sniper’s”window to view the president.Williams told the Warren Commission:After the President’s car had passed my window . . . [there] was a loudshot—first I thought they were saluting the President, somebody—even maybe amotorcycle backfire. The first shot—[then] there was two shots rather closetogether. The second and the third shot was closer together then the first shot. . . well, the first shot—I really did not pay any attention to it, because Idid not know what was happening. The second shot, it sounded like it was rightin the building . . . it even shook the building, the side we were on. Cementfell on my head. . . . Harold was sitting next to me and he said it came fromright over our head. . . . My exact words were, “No bullshit?” And we jumped up.. . . I think Jarman, he—I think he moved before any of us. He moved towards us,and he said, “Man, someone is shooting at the President.” And I think I saidagain, “No bullshit?” . . . Then we all kind of got excited. . . . But, we alldecided we would run down to the west side of the building. . . . We sawpolicemen and people running, scared, running—there are some tracks on the westside of the building, railroad tracks. They were running towards that way. Andwe thought . . . we know the shots came from practically over our head. But . .. we assumed maybe somebody was down there.Norman said he and Jarman had eaten lunch in the domino room on the first floor,then walked out the front door where they saw other Depository employees,including Lovelady, sitting on the steps.As the motorcade approached, they took an elevator to the fifth floor and gotseated in a southeast corner window, where they were joined by Williams momentslater. Norman said he heard three loud shots and “I could also hear somethingsounded like shell hulls hitting the floor.” Later he said he even heard thesound of the bolt working on a rifle above them.After the three men ran to the west window and saw police combing the railroadyards, Norman said, he and Jarman tried to leave the Depository but were turnedback by police officers.Jarman told the same story but said he didn’t hear the shells hit the floor orhear the sound of the rifle bolt. He did say that when the three men ran to theDepository’s west window, “I saw policemen and the secret agents, the FBI men,searching the boxcar yard and the passenger train and things like that.”One thing that has always puzzled assassination researchers is Williams’sstatement of being on the sixth floor until “approximately 12:20,” then Norman’sclaim of hearing ejecting shell casings and the working of the rifle bolt.It has been established that the plywood floor in the Depository was thin andfull of cracks, which could account for the plaster dust that fell on Williams’shead. It could also account for Norman’s hearing shell casings hit the floor andeven the working of the rifle bolt—except that apparently none of the three menon the floor below heard anyone moving above them.How could they have heard shells dropping and a rifle bolt operating and notheard movement above them in the minutes before the shooting? As confirmed byphotographs taken at the time and the testimony of witnesses below, someoneconstructed a “sniper’s nest” of book cartons in the minutes preceding theshooting.Yet Williams, Norman, and Jarman heard nothing?Obviously someone was on the sixth floor, but was it Oswald?"},{"pageContent":"The 56-year-old janitor at the Depository, Eddie Piper, told authorities he sawOswald on the first floor about noon. Oswald, who reportedly never left thesixth floor, told police he had followed the workers down to the first floor andhad eaten lunch in the domino room on the Depository’s first floor.Oswald told interrogators he recalled two black employees walking through theroom while he was there. He said he thought one was named “Junior” and the otherwas short.Jarman’s nickname was “Junior” and Norman was indeed short. Norman, inCommission testimony, said he ate his lunch in the domino room, adding, “I can’tremember who ate in the . . . domino room with me. . . . I think there wassomebody else in there.” But, as happens so often in these interviews, there wasno follow-up question as to who else might have been in the domino room.Jarman told of helping Oswald correct a book order earlier that morning, thentalking with him again on the first floor. Then at lunchtime, Jarman said, hebought a soft drink and returned to where he had been sitting by a first-floorwindow “where Oswald and I was talking.” His testimony is confusing and appearsincomplete. It was not helped by any clarifying questions from the WarrenCommission attorney. It must be understood that in 1963 Dallas, black citizenswere highly suspicious and defensive toward authorities. When confronted bypolice, not to mention federal officers, they were inclined to tell themwhatever they wanted to hear and were easily led in their testimony.This presents a significant question that could have been asked by any competentdefense attorney if Oswald had ever gotten a fair trial. If Oswald was not inthe first-floor domino room as he said, how could he have noted the presence oftwo men and accurately described Norman and Jarman?Bill Shelley, Oswald’s supervisor, told the Commission he saw Oswald near atelephone on the first floor about ten minutes till noon.Carolyn Arnold, secretary to the Depository’s vice president, was quoted in anFBI report saying “she thought she caught a fleeting glimpse of Lee HarveyOswald standing in the [first-floor] hallway” as she left the building to watchthe motorcade at about 12:20 p.m. In 1978, Arnold told the Dallas Morning Newsshe saw and recognized Lee Oswald in the second-floor lunchroom as she wasleaving the building to watch the motorcade at 12:25 p.m. The Warren Commissionclaimed no Depository employee saw Oswald after 11:55 a.m. Arnold stated:I do not recall that he (Oswald) was doing anything. I just recall that he wassitting there . . . in one of the booth seats on the right hand side of the roomas you go in. He was alone as usual and appeared to be having lunch. I did notspeak to him but I recognized him clearly.Arnold said she knew Oswald because he would come to her desk on the secondfloor occasionally and ask for change. He never accepted pennies but onlynickels and dimes. The FBI mangled her testimony, reporting only that after sheleft the depository and stood about thirty feet in front of the building towatch the motorcade, she “thought she caught a fleeting glimpse of Lee HarveyOswald standing in the hallway” on the first floor. In 1978, after reading overher statements of 1963, she stated she had been misquoted by the FBI. She said:That is completely foreign to me. [The FBI account] would have forced me to havebeen turning back around to the building when, in fact, I was trying to watchthe parade. Why would I be looking back inside the building? That doesn’t makeany sense to me.In later years, Arnold, who married and became Mrs. Carolyn Johnston, wassurprised to learn the FBI had made no mention of her sighting Oswald in thelunchroom.While it is still possible that Oswald could have raced upstairs in time to bein the “sniper’s” window by 12:30 p.m., recall that newlyweds Arnold and BarbaraRowland saw two men in the sixth-floor window, one with a rifle, at 12:15. Thistime can be fixed with confidence because Arnold Rowland reported seeing the manwith the gun just as a nearby police radio announced that the presidentialmotorcade was approaching Cedar Springs Road. Police dispatcher’s records showedthe motorcade passed Cedar Springs between 12:15 and 12:16 p.m.The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald stayed on the sixth floor after hewas seen by the elevator racers about 11:55 a.m. and remained there to committhe assassination.As can be seen, there is quite credible evidence that he was exactly where hesaid he was—in the first-floor break or domino room—at the time of the shooting.The domino room was one short flight of steps to the Depository’s front door,where the Oswald figure was photographed by Altgens.Oswald then apparently walked to the Depository’s second-floor lunchroom to buya soft drink. It was there that a Dallas policeman encountered Oswald less thanninety seconds after the final shot was fired in the assassination.The Oswald Encounter [Contents.html#rsec9]Since at 12:30 p.m. November 22, 1963, the presidential motorcade was runningapproximately five minutes behind schedule—probably due to the two unscheduledstops along the way to greet the crowd ordered by Kennedy—it is unbelievablethat an assassin would leisurely wait in the Depository domino room until 12:15to make his move to the sixth floor.Understand that the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository is slightlyabove ground level. One entered the building by walking up a flight of outsidesteps, then an additional flight of stairs at the rear of the building led tothe second floor. Here was located an employees’ lunchroom containing vendingmachines and was reserved exclusively for the white-collar employees of theDepository. Warehouse personnel and order fillers (usually ethnic minorities)were relegated to the first-floor domino room although they were allowed to usethe vending machines.Dallas motorcycle patrolman Marrion Baker rushed to the Depository after seeingpigeons fly off the building’s roof at the sound of the first shots. In a laterreenactment for the Warren Commission, it took Baker only fifteen seconds topark his cycle and race up the front steps of the Depository.Baker told the Warren Commission, “I had it in mind that the shots came from thetop of this building.” He continued:As I entered this lobby there were people going in as I entered. And I asked . .. where the stairs or elevator was, and this man, Mr. Truly, spoke up and saysto me . . . “I’m the building manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you.”So we immediately went out through the second set of doors, and we ran into theswinging door.Depository superintendent Roy Truly had followed Baker into the building. Bothmen tried the elevators near the front entrance but found them inoperable,perhaps due to the electrical outage mentioned by Geneva Hine of theDepository’s credit desk. They quickly went to the building’s elevators on thenorthwest corner of the first floor but could not bring them down since someonehad left them locked in position on an upper floor. Truly told the Commission:Those elevators . . . were both on the fifth floor, they were both even. And Itried to get one of them . . . it would have been impossible for [Oswald] tohave come down either one of those elevators after the assassination. He had touse the stairway as his only way of getting down—since we did see the elevatorsin those positions.Truly yelled, “Bring that elevator down here!” to no avail and Baker said,“Let’s take the stairs.” Moving up the stairs behind Truly, Baker said henoticed a man walking away from him through a glass window in a door near therear second-floor landing. With drawn pistol, Baker confronted the man andordered him to come to him. In a handwritten report to the FBI on November 23,Baker stated, “On the second floor where the lunchroom is located, I saw a manstanding in the lunchroom drinking a Coke.” However, the words “drinking a Coke”were scratched out in this initial report and there was no reference to the Cokein his Warren Commission testimony.Truly said the man he recognized as Oswald “didn’t seem to be excited or overlyafraid.” He told the Warren Commission he noticed nothing in Oswald’s hands, butthis was months later, after many discussions with federal authorities.Baker turned to Truly and asked if the man was an employee and Truly replied hewas. Baker then turned and continued his race for the roof.Oswald apparently simply sauntered down the steps and out the front door of theDepository.Mrs. Robert Reid, clerical supervisor at the Depository, was standing withDepository officials in front of the building at the time shots were fired. Shethen turned and ran into the building to her second-floor office. She told theWarren Commission:I looked up and Oswald was coming in the back door to the office. I met him bythe time I passed my desk several feet and I told him, “Oh, the President’s beenshot, but maybe they didn’t hit him.” He mumbled something to me, I keptwalking, he did too. I didn’t pay any attention to what he said because I had nothoughts of anything of him having any connection with it at all because he wasvery calm. He had gotten a Coke and was holding it in his hands. . . . The onlytime I had seen him in the office was to come and get change and he already hada Coke in his hand so he didn’t come for change.Like Baker, Mrs. Reid reenacted her movements for the Warren Commission on March20, 1964. She said it took approximately two minutes to move the distance fromwhere she heard the final shot to the point she met Oswald.As can be seen, the issue of the Coke becomes critical here.It strains one’s imagination to believe that anyone could fire on the presidentof the United States, then run to the opposite corner of the sixth floor—wherethe rifle was discovered a short time later—stash the weapon, race down fiveflights of stairs with heavy fire doors on each floor, and show no sign ofexertion or anxiety when confronted by a policeman with a drawn pistol.This scenario becomes absurd if the purchase of a Coke from a vending machinewith its attendant fumbling for pocket change is thrown into the time frame.Baker told the FBI the next day that Oswald was “drinking a Coke” when he sawhim but then deleted any reference to the drink in his Warren Commissiontestimony. Truly, months later, said he did not notice anything in Oswald’shands. But Reid said Oswald was holding a Coke when she saw him seconds afterhis encounter with Baker.Even the accused assassin had something to say about the soft drink. In AppendixXI of the Warren Report, Dallas homicide captain Will Fritz reported on hisfirst interview with Oswald about an hour after his arrest at the Texas Theater.Joining Fritz shortly after 3 p.m. were FBI agents James P. Hosty and James W.Bookhout. Fritz quickly got to the point, asking Oswald where he was when thepresident was shot. According to Fritz:He said that he was having his lunch about that time on the first floor. . . . Iasked Oswald where he was when the police officer stopped him. He said he was onthe second floor drinking a Coca-Cola when the officer came in.In their FBI report, Hosty and Bookhout confirm this conversation by noting:Oswald stated that he went to lunch at approximately noon and he claimed he atehis lunch on the first floor in the lunchroom; however he went to the secondfloor where the Coca-Cola machine was located and obtained a bottle of Coca-Colafor his lunch.On November 25, Agent Bookhout filed a report reiterating this account:Oswald stated that on November 22, 1963, at the time of the search of the TexasSchool Book Depository building by Dallas police officers, he was on the secondfloor of said building, having just purchased a Coca-Cola from the soft drinkmachine, at which time a police officer came into the room with pistol drawn andasked him if he worked there.It also should be noted that Captain Fritz’s notes of his interrogation ofOswald, released only in the 1990s, said that Oswald “claims 2nd floor Coke whenoff[icer] came in.”In light of all this information, it seems clear that Oswald indeed was holdinga soft drink when confronted by Officer Baker, which leaves a run across thesixth floor to stash the rifle and a stampede down the wooden stairs in time topurchase a drink almost outside the realm of possibility. The Coke question mayseem a small one, but it also indicates the loopholes riddling the officialstory of the assassination and the lengths the federal government took toobscure certain issues.[images/line.jpg]The problem of Oswald’s documented presence in the Depository’s second-floorlunchroom, with or without a Coke, is compounded by accounts of someone seen onthe sixth floor long after Oswald should have been gone. Clerk Lillian Mooneyhamof the 95th District Court told the FBI that she watched the motorcade move weston Main from windows in the Dallas Criminal Courts Building, then ran with twoothers to the west side of the building. She heard an initial shot, which shetook to be a firecracker, followed by a “slight pause and then two more shotswere discharged, the second and third shots sounding closer together.” Accordingto an FBI report of January 10, 1964, Mooneyham said, “I left Judge [Henry]King’s courtroom and went to the office of Judge Julian C. Hyer . . . where Icontinued to observe the happenings from Judge Hyer’s window.”The FBI report continued:Mrs. Mooneyham estimated that it was about four and a half to five minutesfollowing the shots fired by the assassin, that she looked up towards the sixthfloor of the TSBD and observed the figure of a man standing in the sixth floorwindow behind some cardboard boxes. This man appeared to Mrs. Mooneyham to belooking out of the window; however, the man was not close up to the window butwas standing slightly back from it, so that Mrs. Mooneyham could not make outhis features.Adding support to Mooneyham’s account of a man standing in the “sniper’s nest”window minutes after the shooting are photographs taken about that time bymilitary intelligence agent James Powell and news photographer Tom Dillard.Dillard, who was riding in the motorcade, said he took a picture of theDepository facade seconds after the last shot was fired. Powell estimated hispicture was made about thirty seconds after the final shot.A comparison with photos taken just prior to the shooting led photographicexperts of the House Select Committee on Assassinations to conclude, “There isan apparent rearranging of boxes within two minutes after the last shot wasfired at President Kennedy.” Obviously, Oswald could not have been in theDepository lunchroom meeting Baker and Truly while at the same time arrangingboxes on the sixth floor.Needless to say, Mooneyham was never called as a witness before the WarrenCommission. Her credible testimony remains buried in the Commission’s twenty-sixvolumes.A further point here is that several Depository employees, including BillyLovelady and William Shelley, were on or near the back stairway of the buildingjust after the assassination. No one heard footsteps or saw Oswald racing downthe five flights of stairs for his encounter with Baker and Truly.Recall that Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles, who worked for Scott-Foresman andCompany in the Depository, told the FBI they both ran from the building down theback stairway after viewing the assassination from their fourth-floor officewindow. Neither encountered Oswald on the stairway or remarked of hearingfootsteps on the old wooden stairs moments after the shooting. These were thesame creaky stairs that Oswald would have had to rapidly descend in time for hismeeting with Officer Baker.Adams told the Warren Commission that upon arriving on the first floor she sawfellow Depository employees Bill Shelley and Billy Lovelady. The authors of theCommission’s report tried to dismiss the time frame of Adams’s testimony bystating, “If Miss Adams accurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady whenshe reached the bottom of the stairs, then her estimate of the time when shedescended from the fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down thestairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.”In 2011, author Barry Ernest interviewed Garner, the office supervisor overAdams, Elsie Dorman, and Styles, in 1963. She confirmed that Adams and Stylesboth left the fourth-floor window immediately following the shooting. “Iremember them being there and the next thing I knew, they were gone,” sherecalled. “They left very quickly . . . within a matter of moments.” Garner saidshe followed the women and stood at a vantage point where she could see the backstairs. She heard Adams and Styles moving down the stairs. Asked if she sawOswald on the stairs, Garner laughed and told Ernest she “felt sure she wouldhave remembered it if she had seen Oswald anywhere earlier that day, based onhis later notoriety and the fact it would have made an impression on her mind.”Of great importance, however, Garner said she did recall a policeman on thestairs, who could only have been Officer Baker. Garner’s recollection wassupported by a letter accompanying Adams’s signed deposition to the WarrenCommission sent by assistant US attorney Martha Joe Stroud on June 2, 1964. Thelast paragraph stated, “Miss Garner, Miss Adams’ supervisor, stated this morningthat after Miss Adams went downstairs she (Miss Garner) saw Mr. Truly and thepoliceman come up.”Could Oswald have indeed fired the fatal shots, then stopped to rearrange hisbox supports, then raced to the opposite end of the Depository’s sixth floor,where he reportedly stashed his rifle, then raced silently down five flights ofcreaky stairs unnoticed by the office workers only to be discovered calmlystanding by a soft drink machine by Baker and Truly less than two minutes later?Or was it someone else who fired, then arranged a “sniper’s nest” before quietlyslipping out of the Depository about the time Oswald was encountering Baker andTruly in the second-floor lunchroom?[images/line.jpg]Also standing on the steps of the Depository was Joe R. Molina, the company’scredit manager. Like most everyone else, Molina thought the shots came from westof the building.In 1964, Molina specifically requested to testify to the Warren Commissionbecause of what happened to him after the assassination. Molina said about 1:30a.m. on the Saturday following the assassination, he and his family wereawakened by Dallas police, who began searching his home. Molina told thecommission, “They were looking for something . . . they sort of wanted to tie meup with this case in some way or another and they thought that I wasimplicated.”He said he was questioned about his membership in G.I. Forum, a predominantlyHispanic group actively working to help veterans, and was told to report toDallas police headquarters later that day. Molina was kept waiting at the policestation most of the day, then learned that his name had been given to the newsmedia by Chief Curry, who described Molina as someone associated with “personsof subversive background.” Unable to get a retraction from the Dallas police,Molina asked to testify to the Warren Commission in an attempt to clear hisname. But the damage had already been done.On December 13, twenty-one days after the assassination, Molina was told thatthe Depository’s credit system was to be automated and that he was to bereplaced. He said the action came as no real surprise because the company hadbeen receiving hate mail and phone calls accusing it of hiring communists.Despite assurances from Depository officials that Molina’s firing was notconnected to the events of the assassination, it appears obvious that JoeMolina, too, became one of its victims.Many Depository employees went outside to view the motorcade. Several, such asBonnie Richey, Sharon Nelson, Stella Mae Jacob, and Gloria Jeanne Holt, wereprevented from entering the Depository when police sealed the building. They didnot return for work that day. Most Depository employees signed reports to theFBI during March 1964. Oddly, the reports were all worded alike and agentsapparently never asked critical questions such as “Where did shots come from?”“How many shots?” or “Did you see the effect of any shot?” Most apparently weresimply asked, “Did you know Lee Harvey Oswald?” and “Did you see any strangersin the building that day?”As the evidence quickly piled up against Oswald and the Depository became thecenter of the investigation, the authorities, news media, and public soon forgotthe initial focus of attention in Dealey Plaza—the Triple Underpass.The Triple Underpass [Contents.html#rsec10]On the west side of Dealey Plaza is a large railroad bridge that spans the threemain downtown Dallas traffic arteries of Commerce, Main, and Elm Streets.Since all three streets converge under this concrete bridge, it quickly becameknown as the Triple Underpass. To the east of the underpass is Dealey Plaza anddowntown Dallas, while on the west there are several roads leading to freewaysystems and an industrial area.Atop the east side of the Triple Underpass is a panoramic view of Dealey Plazafrom a position about fifteen feet in the air.This was the position of about a dozen men on November 22, 1963, as they stoodalong the eastern edge of the underpass to watch the presidential motorcadeapproach and pass beneath them.Dallas policeman J. W. Foster was one of two police officers assigned assecurity guards atop the Triple Underpass. His orders were to prevent any“unauthorized” personnel from standing on the railroad bridge under whichKennedy passed.Foster had allowed some railroad workers, who had been repairing rails, toremain on the underpass after checking their identities. Since the bridgeactually was railroad property and it was railway workers who walked over to theeastern banister to view the motorcade, he did not believe they fell into the“unauthorized” category.He told the Warren Commission he earlier had prevented some people from standingon the bridge—one of these was AP photographer James Altgens.Foster said as the motorcade approached he was standing just behind the line ofrailway workers, about ten or eleven of them, when he heard what sounded like alarge firecracker. He moved up to the concrete railing to get a better view. Hesaid he saw “the President slump over in the car, and his head looked just likeit blew up.”From his vantage point—above and directly in front of the car—this trained andexperienced police officer may have been one of the best witnesses to whatactually happened at the time of the shooting. However, neither in his report ofDecember 4, 1963, nor in his April 9, 1964, testimony to the Warren Commissionwas he asked to describe in detail what he saw.Warren Commission lawyer Joseph Ball did ask Foster his opinion as to the sourceof the shots and Foster replied, “It came from back in toward the corner of Elmand Houston Streets [the location of the Texas School Book Depository].”Foster said he ran from the underpass toward the Depository building, where hewatched the rear exits until a sergeant came and told him to check out railroadcars in the nearby switching yard. However, Foster said he went instead to thefront of the Depository and told a supervisor where he was when shots werefired, then “moved to—down the roadway there, down to see if I could find whereany of the shots hit.”He was successful, telling the Commission he “found where one shot had hit theturf.”Foster said he found where a bullet had struck the earth just beside a manholecover on the south side of Elm Street. Foster remained at this location for atime until the evidence was taken away by a man in a suit, later identified bythe Dallas police chief as an FBI agent.The spot where Foster found a tear in the grass was near where witness Jean Hillwas standing at the time of the assassination. Shortly after the shooting, shewas questioned by Secret Service agents, one of whom asked her if she saw abullet land near her feet.Foster’s counterpart on the west side of the Triple Underpass was Officer J. C.White. White said he was approximately in the middle of the underpass when themotorcade passed below, but that he didn’t see or hear anything because a “biglong freight train” was moving north between him and Dealey Plaza. Oddly, closescrutiny of films and photographs taken that day show no such freight trainmoving at that time.But if the stories of the two Dallas policemen on top of the underpass seemstrangely incomplete and sketchy, this was not the case of the railroad workersstanding over the motorcade. These workers not only heard shots from their left,the direction of the infamous Grassy Knoll, but also saw smoke drift out fromunder the trees lining the knoll.Smoke on the Grassy Knoll [Contents.html#rsec11]About forty witnesses on or around the infamous Grassy Knoll said they heardshots or saw smoke in that area. Most were ignored by the Warren Commission.Sam M. Holland, a track and signal supervisor for the Union Terminal RailroadCompany, told the Warren Commission he went to the top of the Triple Underpassabout 11:45 a.m. that day. He said there were two Dallas policemen and “aplainclothes detective, or FBI agent or something like that” there and that hehelped identify the railroad employees. He said by the time the motorcadearrived, other people were lining the Triple Underpass, but that the police werechecking identification and sending them away.By the time the presidential limousine was approaching the underpass, Hollandwas standing just in front of Officer Foster. He told the commission:And the motorcade was coming down in this fashion, and the President was wavingto the people on this [north] side [of Elm]. . . . The first report that I heard. . . was pretty loud . . . and the car traveled a few yards and GovernorConnally turned in this fashion, like that, with his hand out and . . . anotherreport rang out and he slumped down in his seat . . . [then Kennedy] was hitagain along . . . in here. . . . I observed it. It knocked him completely downon the floor . . . just slumped completely over. . . . I heard a third reportand I counted four shots. . . . There was a shot, a report. I don’t know whetherit was a shot. I can’t say that. And a puff of smoke came out about six or eightfeet above the ground right out from under those trees.Holland said the first two or three shots seemed to come from “the upper part ofthe street,” followed by others of “different sounds, different reports.” In a1966 filmed interview, Holland was even more specific:I looked over to where I thought the shot came from and I saw a puff of smokestill lingering under the trees in front of the wooden fence. The report soundedlike it came from behind the wooden fence. . . . I know where the third shotcame from—behind the picket fence. There’s no doubt whatsoever in my mind.Due to Holland’s credibility and clear description of what he saw, the WarrenCommission Report accurately stated, “According to S. M. Holland, there werefour shots which sounded as though they came from the trees on the north side ofElm Street where he saw a puff of smoke.”Having mentioned the smoke in the trees, the report went on to conclude, “Incontrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed shots firedfrom the Depository, the Commission’s investigation has disclosed no credibleevidence that any shots were fired from anywhere else.”The clear implication by the Warren Report is that Holland was mistaken inbelieving shots came from behind the wooden picket fence. However, the testimonyof the other railroad workers on the Triple Underpass—Richard C. Dodd, James L.Simmons, and Thomas J. Murphy, none of whom were asked to testify to the WarrenCommission—corroborated Holland’s version of the assassination. The only accountof what they saw is in FBI reports made during March 1964. These reports aresketchy and seem very incomplete in view of the questions that these men shouldobviously have been asked.Simmons, a Union Terminal car inspector, was in the group on the TripleUnderpass. In his FBI report, it merely states:When the President’s car started down Elm Street he heard three shots ring out.President Kennedy slumped down in his seat and appeared to have been hit by abullet. . . . Simmons said he thought he saw exhaust fumes of smoke near theembankment in front of the Texas School Book Depository building.During a 1966 filmed interview, Simmons’s account is much clearer:As the President’s limousine rounded the curve on Elm Street, there was a loudexplosion. . . . It sounded like it came from the left and in front of us,towards the wooden fence. And there was a puff of smoke that came fromunderneath the trees on the embankment directly in front of the wooden fence. .. . I was talking to Patrolman Foster at the time and as soon as we heard theshots, we ran around to [behind] the picket fence. . . . There was no one therebut there were footprints in the mud around the fence and footprints on thetwo-by-four railing on the fence.Railroad workers who also saw smoke off to their left included Nolan H. Potter,Richard C. Dodd, and Clemon E. Johnson.Simmons was quoted in his FBI report as seeing smoke near the Depository, yet heplainly stated later that it was in front of the Grassy Knoll fence. There is nomention of smoke in Dodd’s FBI report, yet in a later filmed interview, he said,“Smoke came from behind the hedge on the north side of the plaza.”In 1966 interviews in Dallas, both Walter L. Winborn and Thomas J. Murphy—whowere among the railroad workers on the Triple Underpass—confirmed seeing smokein the trees on the Grassy Knoll.It would be most interesting to talk to the other people who stood on the TripleUnderpass that day. Perhaps they, too, saw the smoke, but such sighting was leftout of their reports—if any report was made.Further corroboration of the smoke came well into the 1980s, when a frame fromTV news film was analyzed by assassination researchers. NBC photographer DaveWeigman was riding in the seventh car in the motorcade. Hearing shots, Weigmanstarted filming even before the firing stopped. He then jumped out of theconvertible and ran up the Grassy Knoll with his camera still operating. Becauseof all this motion, his blurred and jerky film was overlooked as assassinationevidence until recently. However, in one clear frame, which depicts thepresidential limousine just entering the Triple Underpass, a puff of smoke isclearly visible hanging in front of trees on the knoll—exactly where Holland andthe other railroad workers placed it.It has been well established that there was no other natural source of smoke inthat area that day. FBI reports attempted to show that it might have come frompolice motorcycles but none were on the knoll at the time.Warren Commission apologists for years have tried to argue that modern rifles donot smoke. This is an error, since a recently oiled rifle or defectiveammunition certainly can cause white smoke during firing. This was made clear tothis author in the summer of 1978 when the House Select Committee onAssassinations fired rifles in Dealey Plaza in connection with their acousticalstudies. Visible puffs of smoke were common.And considering the slightly gusting breeze from the north that day, the ideathat smoke drifted over Elm Street from the knoll is highly plausible. It is nowobvious that many people that day saw this puff of smoke drifting down from theknoll—also recall those witnesses who said they smelled gunpowder in the lowerend of Dealey Plaza. However, it is equally obvious that the authorities,particularly the FBI and the Warren Commission, did not want to hear about it.Dallas policeman Earle Brown also smelled gunpowder although he was far from theDepository. Brown was standing on the catwalk of a railroad bridge crossing overStemmons Freeway located just north of the Triple Underpass. Because of hislocation, Brown said he was unable to get a clear view of the motorcade. Brownsaid the first indication to him that something was wrong was when a large flockof pigeons suddenly flew up from a grassy low area between him and theunderpass. He said, “They heard the shots before we did because I saw themflying up . . . then I heard these shots and then I smelled this gunpowder. . .. It come on . . . maybe a couple of minutes later.”Brown said the gunpowder smell seemed to come from the direction of theDepository. However, the Grassy Knoll was almost in a direct line between theofficer and the Depository.Another railroad worker, Royce G. Skelton, supported the statements of SheriffDecker and others who saw one of the first bullets strike the pavement nearKennedy’s car.In an affidavit signed the day of the assassination, Skelton stated:I was standing on top of the train trestle where it crosses Elm Street withAustin Miller. We saw the motorcade come around the corner and I heard somethingwhich I thought was fireworks. I saw something hit the pavement at the left rearof the [President’s] car, then the car got in the right-hand lane and I heardtwo more shots. I heard a woman [say] “Oh no” or something and grab a man insidethe car. I then heard another shot and saw the bullet hit the pavement. Theconcrete was knocked to the south away from the car. It hit the pavement in theleft or center lane.Austin Miller, standing next to Skelton on the Triple Underpass, also mentionedthis errant bullet in his affidavit that day. Miller stated:I saw a convertible automobile turn west on Elm off Houston Street. It had[proceeded] about halfway from Houston Street to the Underpass when I heard whatsounded like a shot [then in] a short second two more sharp reports. . . . Oneshot apparently hit the street past the car. I saw something which I thought wassmoke or steam coming from a group of trees north of Elm off the railroadtracks.If a bullet hit the street pavement, it certainly could not have been the onethat passed through Kennedy and Connally as described by the Warren Commissionand it was not the bullet that struck the Main Street curb wounding a bystander.But more than three shots would mean more than one assassin.[images/line.jpg]The one assassination witness who singlehandedly caused more concern than anyoneelse within the 1963–1964 federal investigation was Jim Tague, the third manwounded in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.The Third Wounded Man [Contents.html#rsec12]James Thomas Tague, like Jean Hill and Mary Moorman, was not planning to seeKennedy. Shortly after noon that day, he had driven downtown to take agirlfriend (later his wife) to lunch.As Tague drove his car east on Commerce Street, he found himself stopped in thetraffic that was halted at Houston Street due to the arrival of the presidentialmotorcade. The hood of his car was just poking out the east side of the TripleUnderpass. Tague got out of his car and stood by the underpass on a smallconcrete median separating Commerce and Main to watch the motorcade.In an interview with this author, Tague said when the shots were fired, heimmediately thought, “Who’s the nut throwing firecrackers?” However, afterhearing more shots, he realized what was happening and ducked behind the cornerof the underpass. He said the shots were coming from the area of the GrassyKnoll “behind the concrete monument.”Tague was watching a policeman run up the Grassy Knoll with a drawn pistol whenanother policeman came up to him asking, “What happened?” “I don’t know,”mumbled the shocked Tague.Dallas motorcycle patrolman Clyde A. Haygood had been riding back in themotorcade on Main Street approaching Main when he heard a shot, then a pausefollowed by two shots close together. He gunned his three-wheeled motorcycle upon Houston and turned on Elm in time to see people pointing toward the GrassyKnoll and the railroad yards.Haygood said he got off his cycle on Elm Street just below the Grassy Knoll andwent up into the railroad yards but saw nothing suspicious despite quite anumber of people in the area. He said he returned to his motorcycle afterspeaking to a man he believed to be a railroad detective.Haygood told the Warren Commission:At that time some people came up and started talking to me as to the shooting. .. . One came up . . . and said he had gotten hit by a piece of concrete orsomething, and he did have a slight cut on his right cheek, upper portion of hischeek just to the right of his nose.Haygood said just then another witness came up and told him the first shot hadcome from the Texas School Book Depository. Using the call number 142, Haygoodradioed the police dispatcher and asked that the Depository be sealed off. Healso mentioned a man who had been wounded by flying concrete.Tague and the policeman walked into the plaza a bit and encountered a man, whowas sobbing, “His head exploded!” This man apparently was Charles Brehm.Moments later deputy sheriff Eddy R. Walthers arrived and, pointing to Tague,said, “You’ve got blood on your face.”In his report that day, Walthers, who was standing with the other deputies infront of the sheriff’s office, stated:I immediately went to the Triple Underpass on Elm Street in an effort to locatepossible marks left by stray bullets. While I was looking for possible marks,some unknown person stated to me that something had hit his face while he wasparked on Main Street. . . . Upon examining the curb and pavement in thisvicinity I found where a bullet had splattered on the top edge of the curb onMain Street. . . . Due to the fact that the projectile struck so near theunderpass, it was, in my opinion, probably the last shot that was fired and hadapparently went high and above the President’s car.Tague said he called the Dallas FBI office later that afternoon, to tell themabout the bullet striking the curb, but “they didn’t want my testimony about thestray bullet.” Apparently no one else wanted to hear about the extraneous bulleteither. There was no mention of the incident in the news accounts at the timenor was there any investigation of the bullet mark on the curb until the summerof 1964.During late 1963 and early 1964, it was widely reported that the first shotstruck Kennedy in the back, the second bullet hit Governor Connally, and thethird was the fatal head shot. This was a consistent theory of three bullets.Tague’s story of yet another bullet was totally inconsistent with thelone-assassin/three-shot theory being formulated by the Warren Commission, whichinitially seemed prepared to ignore both Tague and the bullet mark on the curb.In fact, there may have been an effort to eliminate the evidence. In late May1964, about a month before the Warren Commission finally talked to Tague, thecar salesman took a camera to Dealey Plaza to photograph the mark on the curb.He was surprised to find that it was not there. Only faint traces of the bulletmark were found. Tague said it looked as if someone had tried to repair thecurb.Apparently it was a letter from an assistant US attorney in Dallas that finallyprompted the Warren Commission to confront the Tague wounding. Martha Joe Stroudmailed a letter to Commission general counsel J. Lee Rankin on June 9, 1964. Inthe letter was the comment:I am enclosing a photograph made by Tom Dillard of the Dallas Morning News. Itis a shot of the curb which was taken shortly after the assassination onNovember 22, 1963. When I talked to Mr. Dillard yesterday he indicated he didnot know whether the photograph was material. He did say, however, that heexamined the curb when the photo was taken and that it looked like a piece oflead had struck it.Faced with this notification of the curb shot by a government official, theCommission was stirred to action. On July 7, 1964, the Warren Commission askedthe FBI to look into the matter. In an FBI document dated July 17, the FBIstated, “The area on the curb [where the bullet or fragment hit] was carefullychecked and it was ascertained there was no nick in the curb in the checkedarea, nor was any mark observed.”This FBI document attempted to explain the disappearance of a mark that had beenplainly seen eight months earlier. It stated:It should be noted that, since this mark was observed on November 22, 1963,there have been numerous rains, which could have possibly washed away such amark and also that the area is cleaned by a street cleaning machine about once aweek, which could also wash away any such mark.But if the FBI could ignore the mark, the Commission could not. Since both aDallas policeman and a sheriff’s deputy had mentioned Tague in their reports,although not by name, and after the arrival of Assistant US Attorney Stroud’sletter, his story could no longer be ignored.On July 23, 1964, Tague finally was deposed in Dallas by Commission attorneyWesley Liebeler.Following Tague’s testimony, the Commission again asked the bureau toinvestigate the matter. This time the FBI suddenly found the mark, removed thepiece of curb in question and took it to Washington for analysis. In an August12, 1964, report signed by J. Edgar Hoover, it was stated:Small foreign metal smears were found adhering to the curbing section within thearea of the mark. These metal smears were spectrographically determined to beessentially lead with a trace of antimony. No copper was found. The lead couldhave originated from the lead core of a mutilated metal-jacketed bullet such asthe type of bullet loaded into 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridges orfrom some other source having the same composition. . . . The absence of copperprecludes the possibility that the mark on the curbing section was made by anunmutilated military-type full metal-jacketed bullet. . . . Further, the damageto the curbing would have been much more extensive if a rifle bullet had struckthe curbing without first having struck some other object. Therefore, this markcould not have been made by the first impact of a high-velocity bullet.So the FBI, which at first had stated no bullet hit the curb, now said the markhad to have been made by a rifle bullet but not on first impact. If the FBI iscorrect—and keep in mind the many instances of misinformation and omission bythe bureau regarding assassination evidence—the mark on the curb could only havebeen made by the lead fragment of a bullet.Yet the only one that could have lost such an amount of lead is the final headshot and that was at a location more than two hundred feet away, a considerabledistance for a small fragment to travel and still impact the curb as described.If the bullet mark on the curb was a miss, it was an incredible miss. If theshot that struck the Main Street curb came from the Texas School BookDepository’s sixth floor, it must have missed Kennedy by thirty-three feet inthe air and twenty-one feet to the right. Such a miss is hardly compatible withthe claim that Oswald was able to hit home with two out of three shots with amisaligned scope on his inefficient rifle aiming at a target moving laterallyand away from him at a distance of more than 265 feet.Another possibility, never considered by the Warren Commission, was that themark was made by a lead bullet without copper jacketing. But of course, thiswould indicate different ammunition and perhaps a different rifle from the oneallegedly used by Oswald. Or perhaps the curb was hit by a large fragment ofbullet that had already struck the street (recall the witnesses who saw one dojust that) and had separated from the copper jacket.Whatever the truth of the curb bullet and despite the attempt to ignore thisevidence, the matter of the wounding of Tague was finally acknowledged and theWarren Commission was compelled to construct a scenario of the assassinationthat included the “single-bullet theory,” which postulates that one bulletcaused seven wounds to Kennedy and Connally. This theory has not been acceptedby a majority of Americans. More on that later.[images/line.jpg]Despite immediate attempts to establish the Texas School Book Depository as thesole location from which shots were fired, public attention, both in 1963 andeven today, continued to be drawn to the wooded hillock to the west of theDepository that has become known as the Grassy Knoll.The Grassy Knoll [Contents.html#rsec13]Probably no small section of land in the United States has been the object ofmore controversy than that small northern portion of Dealey Plaza known as theGrassy Knoll.While Elm Street and two large grassy areas of Dealey Plaza dip downapproximately 24 feet as one travels the 495 feet from Houston Street on theeast, the Grassy Knoll remains at ground level.There actually are two grassy knolls on both the north and south sides of thewest end of the plaza, but during the assassination of President John F.Kennedy, it was the north knoll that drew public attention.Located between the Texas School Book Depository and the Triple Underpass, theGrassy Knoll provided an ideal ambush site. Running along the top of the knollwas a wooden picket fence about five feet high. In front of this fence wereshrubs and evergreen trees that, even in late November, provided a leafy canopyover the fence. The fence ran east approximately seventy-five feet from thenorth edge of the Triple Underpass, then turned north for about fifty feet,ending in a parking area behind a concrete pergola located to the west of theDepository.It was from a vantage point atop a low concrete wall on the south end of thispergola that the most famous home movie of all time was made—the AbrahamZapruder film.The Zapruder Film [Contents.html#rsec14]A 26.6-second, 8 mm film made on November 22, 1963, became the cornerstone ofinvestigations, both public and private, in the years after the Kennedyassassination. It has been long regarded as the most objective, and thus mostimportant, piece of evidence in the attempts to unravel what actually happenedto President Kennedy. And it almost didn’t happen.Abraham Zapruder, a native of Russia and a thirty-third-degree Freemason, in1963 was a ladies’ dress manufacturer with offices in the Dal-Tex Building at501 Elm Street in downtown Dallas near Jack Ruby’s nightclub and across thestreet from the Texas School Book Depository. He had a new camera but had notintended to film that day. What with his work and the morning rains, Zapruderthought “I wouldn’t have a chance even to see the President.” But his secretary,Lillian Rogers, urged him to make use of his new camera—a Bell & Howell 8mmcamera with a telephoto lens. So Zapruder made a fourteen-mile round-trip driveto his home to pick up his camera. By the time he returned, crowds were alreadygathering to watch the motorcade.After trying several different locations—none of which proved suitable forviewing the president without obstructions—Zapruder finally climbed onto afour-foot-high concrete block at the end of two steps leading to the pergola onthe north Grassy Knoll. He almost lost his balance while testing his camera onsome nearby office workers, so he asked one in the group, his receptionistMarilyn Sitzman, to join him and provide steady support. From this excellentvantage point, Zapruder and Sitzman watched the motorcade approach Elm Street.Having set the camera’s speed control on “run” and his lens on “telephoto,”Zapruder proceeded to film the entire assassination sequence.The film must be seen run in its entirety for a viewer to actually receive itsmaximum impact. But, in synopsis, the film shows:The motorcade curves onto Elm and begins moving slowly toward the camera.President Kennedy and his wife are smiling and waving to opposite sides of thestreet. Then the presidential limousine disappears for a brief second behind afreeway sign and when it emerges, Kennedy is already reacting to a shot. Heclenches his fists and brings both up to his throat. He does not appear to sayanything, but only remains stiff and upright, sagging slightly to his left.Connally turns to his right, apparently trying to see behind him, then begins toturn back to his left when he freezes. His hair flies up and his mouth opens. Heis obviously struck by a bullet. Mrs. Kennedy meanwhile has placed her hand onher husband’s arm and is looking at him horrified as he continues to sag towardher. A few seconds pass and, by now, Kennedy is bent slightly forward. Suddenly,after an almost imperceptible forward motion of his head, the entire right sideof his skull explodes in a halo of blood and brain matter. Kennedy is slammedviolently backward to the left rear where he rebounds off the back of the seatand falls toward the car’s floor. Mrs. Kennedy climbs onto the trunk of thelimousine in an effort to grab something while a Secret Service agent leaps ontothe rear of the car, which finally begins to accelerate.On July 22, 1964, Zapruder told the Warren Commission, “I heard the first shotand I saw the President lean over and grab himself like this [holding his leftchest area].”His testimony is very pertinent because the Warren Commission, in its attempt toprove a lone assassin fired from the sixth floor of the Depository, stated:The evidence indicated that the President was not hit until at least frame 210and that he was probably hit by frame 225. The possibility of variations inreaction time in addition to the obstruction of Zapruder’s view by the signprecluded a more specific determination than that the President was probablyshot through the neck between frames 210 and 225.By placing the moment of the first shot at the point where Kennedy was out ofZapruder’s sight behind the sign, the Commission moved the shot closer to thevisual effect of a strike on Connally, buttressing the “single bullet” theory.By moving the time of the shot forward, the Commission also abolished theworrisome problem of how an assassin in the sixth-floor window could haveaccurately fired through obscuring tree branches.The problem with the Commission’s scenario of a hit between frame 210 and 225,of course, is that Zapruder claims he saw Kennedy react to the first shot, whichhad to have happened before he disappeared from camera view.Zapruder went on to tell the Commission that following the shooting, he saw somemotorcycle policemen “running right behind me . . . in the line of theshooting.” He said, “I guess they thought it came from right behind me.” Whenasked where he thought the shots came from, Zapruder replied, “I also thought itcame from back of me.”In fact, Zapruder stated on four separate occasions in his testimony that hethought shots came from behind him in the direction of the picket fence on theGrassy Knoll.But when Commission attorney Wesley J. Liebeler asked Zapruder, “But you didn’tform any opinion at that time as to what direction the shots did come fromactually?” Zapruder—who by this time was fully familiar with the public positionthat Oswald had fired three shots from the Depository—was confused and replied,“No.” This response has been seized upon by some debunkers who claimed Zapruderdid not know from which direction the shots came.Zapruder, who was very shaken by the assassination, noted that there wasconsiderable reverberation in Dealey Plaza at the time. He said he did notremember jumping down from the cement block and crouching for cover inside thewhite pergola with Sitzman as determined by photographs taken at the time orgoing back to his office. He recalled only walking back up Elm Street in a daze,yelling, “They shot him, they shot him, they shot him.”His secretary called authorities and soon Dallas Secret Service agent in chargeForrest Sorrels and Dallas Morning News reporter Harry McCormack came to takehis film for processing.The day after the assassination, select frames from Zapruder’s film had beensold to Life magazine. In charge of the sale was Life’s publisher, C. D.Jackson, who later claimed he was so horrified by the film that he wanted tolock it away. However, in later years, Jackson was shown to have been closelyassociated with CIA officials and ranking globalists such as Allen Dulles, JohnJ. McCloy, and Joseph Alsop, the latter being instrumental in establishing theWarren Commission. As revealed in British Security Coordination (BSC) filesdeclassified in 1998, Dulles, who represented prewar Nazis and later served asCIA director, was recruited as a British agent in 1940. When the first CIAdirector, Walter Bedell Smith, wanted prominent Americans as members of theshadowy and elitist Bilderberger organization, he said he “turned the matterover to C. D. Jackson and things really got going.”The sale of the Zapruder film to Life might be the only instance of a privatecompany purchasing critical evidence in a major crime prior to any court trials.Asked about the sale by Liebeler, Zapruder said, “Well, I just wonder whether Ishould answer it or not because it involves a lot of things and it’s not oneprice—it’s a question of how they are going to use it, are they going to use itor are they not going to use it.”He finally said, “I received $25,000, as you know, and I have given that to theFiremen’s and Policemen’s Benevolence with a suggestion, [to use the money] forMrs. Tippit [wife of the Dallas policeman slain the afternoon of theassassination].”Later in his testimony, Zapruder told of giving his camera to Bell & Howell forits archives. He said, in return, he asked the company to donate a soundprojector to the “Golden Age Group.” He told Liebeler, “I didn’t want anythingfor myself. . . . I don’t like to talk about it too much.”After the trauma of the assassination, the American public was gratified tolearn from the media that Zapruder had received only $25,000 for his film andthat the money was to have gone to the widow of the slain Officer Tippit. Likeso much of the Warren Commission testimony, Zapruder’s statement was less thantruthful.A copy of his contract with Life made public much later revealed that his filmbrought him more than $150,000. This would be close to $1 million in today’smoney. He also received 50 percent of Time-Life profits from rights to the film.Why so much for one film? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that nomember of the American public saw the Zapruder film run as a movie while it wasin the sole possession of Time-Life Corp.While few, if any, of the Warren Commission members viewed the film, singleframes from this important piece of evidence were printed in Volume XVIII. Butan odd thing happened. No one who has viewed the Zapruder film has beenunaffected by the final, gory head shot followed instantaneously by Kennedy’sviolent fall rearward. Most researchers consider this moment in the film asobvious evidence of a shot from Kennedy’s right front, the location of theGrassy Knoll.Yet when published by the Warren Commission, the critical frames that depict therearward motion of Kennedy’s head were transposed to indicate a forward motion.In 1965 FBI director J. Edgar Hoover explained this reversing of the Zapruderframes as a “printing error.”Further twisting of what was depicted in the film came soon after theassassination. In its December 6, 1963, issue, Life magazine reported the factthat the Dallas doctors regarded a small wound in Kennedy’s throat as anentrance wound, a real problem considering that the Texas School Book Depositorywas to his rear at all times. So a Life writer simply threw out the explanation:But [Zapruder’s] 8mm film shows the President turning his body far around to theright as he waves to someone in the crowd. His throat is exposed—toward thesniper’s nest—just before he clutches it.This account is patently wrong, as anyone who has seen the film can attest. Thereason for such wrongful information at such a critical time will probably neverbe known, as the author of this statement, Paul Mandel, died shortly afterward.Then there is the story of news anchor Dan Rather, which has been known toassassination researchers for years. Rather, then a CBS newsman, was the onlyreporter present at a private screening of the Zapruder film the day after theassassination. He described what was in the film over nationwide radio and wasfairly accurate until he described the fatal head shot.Rather stated Kennedy’s head “went forward with considerable violence,” theexact opposite of what is in the film. In his 1987 book, The Camera NeverBlinks, Rather ironically attempted to explain this misstatement by claiming hemust have blinked at that moment in the film. Several months later, Rather waspromoted to White House correspondent for CBS and by the 1980s, he was chiefnews anchorman.Another questionable statement by Rather involves his location at the time ofthe assassination. In his book, Rather wrote how he was waiting to pick up newsfilm from a CBS cameraman in the presidential motorcade. He wrote he wasstanding on the west side of the Triple Underpass and missed witnessing theassassination by only a few yards.However, recently discovered film footage of the west side of the underpass hasnow become public. This film plus some still photographs show the Kennedylimousine speeding through the underpass and onto Stemmons Freeway—but no signof Dan Rather.The American public finally got the opportunity to view the Zapruder film onlybecause of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans during 1967–1969. During thatturbulent trial, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison attempted to provethere was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy and that New Orleans Trade Martdirector Clay Shaw was a member of that conspiracy.As part of Garrison’s attempt to prove the existence of a conspiracy, hesubpoenaed the Zapruder film from Time-Life Corp. Time-Life fought this subpoenaall the way to the Supreme Court, which finally ruled that the corporation hadto comply with the legal subpoena.Time-Life grudgingly turned over to Garrison a somewhat blurry copy of thefilm—but that was enough. Soon, thanks to the copying efforts of Garrison’sstaff, bootleg Zapruder films were in the hands of several assassinationresearchers.Finally in March 1975, a copy of the film was aired nationally about midnight onABC’s Goodnight America thanks to guests Robert Groden and comedian DickGregory. At long last, the American public was able to see for themselves theassassination of the thirty-fifth president. Within a few years clearer copiesof the Zapruder film became available to the public.From the beginning, researchers have used the Zapruder film as the cornerstoneof assassination evidence—a virtual time clock of the events in Dealey Plaza,based on the known average camera speed of 18.3 frames per second.Today the Zapruder film itself has been called into question. In 1971, authorDavid Lifton was permitted to view an exceptionally good-quality copy of theZapruder film in Time-Life’s Los Angeles office. He said the rear of Kennedy’shead in the critical moments following the head shot appeared to have been“blacked out” and he discovered “splices on the film which had never beenmentioned by Time-Life.”His suspicion that the film may have been tampered with by persons with accessto sophisticated photographic equipment was heightened in 1976 with the releaseof CIA Item 450. This group of documents, pried from the agency by a Freedom ofInformation Act suit, indicated the Zapruder film was at the CIA’s NationalPhoto Interpretation Center possibly on the night of the assassination and“certainly within days of the assassination.” One of the documents tells of theexistence of either a negative or a master positive of the film and calls forthe production of four prints—one “test print” and three duplicates.Interestingly, that number of prints is exactly what existed in Dallas the dayafter the assassination—one original and three copies.Lifton wrote:In my view, previously unreported CIA possession of the Zapruder filmcompromised the film’s value as evidence: (1) the forward motion of Kennedy’shead, for one frame preceding frame 313, might be the result of an altered film,and if that was so, it made the theory of a forward high-angle shot . . .completely unnecessary; (2) an altered film might also explain why the occipitalarea [of Kennedy’s head], where the Dallas doctors saw a wound, appearssuspiciously dark, whereas a large wound appears on the forward, right-hand sideof the head, where the Dallas doctors saw no wound at all.The late Jack White, a photographic analyst and researcher who testified to theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations, concurred with Lifton, stating hedetected evidence of photographic retouching in some Zapruder frames.Interception and alteration of the Z film prior to its delivery to Time-Life hasnow been confirmed by documents, witness testimony, and the scrutiny ofHollywood experts, as will be detailed later.Long considered one of the best pieces of evidence, if the CIA indeed tamperedwith the Zapruder film after the assassination, it becomes problematic inevaluating what really happened in Dealey Plaza.And like so much else in the assassination case, the suppression, alteration,and deception surrounding the Zapruder film may eventually reveal more than thefilm itself.In April 1975, for $1 Time-Life sold the Zapruder film back to the heirs ofZapruder, who died in 1970. The film was placed in cold storage within theNational Archives for safekeeping. With the passage of the JFK Act in 1992, theZapruder family, fearful that the film could be taken as an assassinationrecord, tried to retrieve it but was rebuffed by the National Archives andRecords Administration. Their fear was justified, as the Assassination RecordsReview Board designated the film as a JFK record belonging to the government. In1998, the film was digitally replicated under license of the Zapruder family anddistributed under the title Image of an Assassination: A New Look at theZapruder Film. The government kept the film but compensated the Zapruder familywith $16 million of taxpayer money.In December 1999, the original film was donated to the Sixth Floor Museum inDallas, where it resides today.[images/line.jpg]Just down the slope of the Grassy Knoll from Zapruder was the Bill Newmanfamily. They not only noticed Zapruder with his camera, but in later years,Newman told this author, “At first I thought he shot the president.”Bill and Gayle Newman, along with their two young sons, had gone to Love Fieldto see Kennedy. But when they didn’t get a good view, they rushed downtown andsituated themselves on Elm Street just below the concrete cupola on the GrassyKnoll. Newman recalled for this author:We hadn’t been there five minutes when the President turned onto Elm Street. Ashe was coming straight toward us there was a boom, boom, real close together. Ithought someone was throwing firecrackers. He got this bewildered look on hisface and was sort of slowly moving back and forth. Then he got nearer to us and,bam, a shot took the right side of his head off. His ear flew off. I heard Mrs.Kennedy say, “Oh, my God, no, they shot Jack!” He was knocked violently backagainst the seat, almost as if he had been hit by a baseball bat. At that time Iwas looking right at the president and I thought the shots were coming fromdirectly behind us. I said, “That’s it! Get on the ground!” The car momentarilystopped and the driver seemed to have a radio or phone up to his ear and heseemed to be waiting on some word. Some Secret Service men reached into theircar and came out with some sort of machine gun. Then the cars roared off. Verysoon after this a man asked us what happened and we told him and he took us toChannel 8 [WFAA-TV] studios.Newman said some sheriff’s deputies were waiting for them after the TV interviewand took them to the sheriff’s office, where they joined other Dealey Plazawitnesses who were held for about six hours.He said that on Sunday, November 24, some FBI agents came to their home and“took down what we said.” That was the last contact the Newmans had with federalauthorities. He said:I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get called to testify to the WarrenCommission. Someone told me that the reason I wasn’t asked to testify was that Iwas talking about shots from someplace other than the Depository building. . . .I’ve already been corrected several times that I was wrong about several thingsand that there are experts who know more about it than I do. But it’s real hardfor me to believe that it was the act of one lone individual. I’ve gotten thefeeling over the years that people in Washington know what really happened butit’s never been divulged. But then I have no evidence to that.Near the Newmans was Cheryl McKinnon, who later became a reporter for the SanDiego Star News. In 1983, she wrote of her experience:On Nov. 22, 1963, I stood, along with hundreds of others, on the Grassy Knoll inDealey Plaza, waiting for just one thing—a chance to see, even just for amoment, that magical person, the President, John F. Kennedy. . . . As ajournalism major in school, my plans were to write about my experiences as aclass project. . . . As we stood watching the motorcade turn onto Elm Street, Itried to grasp every tiny detail of both President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy.“How happy they look,” I thought. Suddenly three shots in rapid succession rangout. Myself and dozens of others standing nearby turned in horror toward theback of the Grassy Knoll where it seemed the sounds had originated. Puffs ofwhite smoke still hung in the air in small patches. But no one was visible. . .. I tried to maintain the faith with my government. I have read the WarrenCommission Report in its entirety and dozens of other books as well. I am sorryto say that the only thing I am absolutely sure of today is that at least two ofthe shots fired that day in Dealey Plaza came from behind where I stood on theKnoll, not from the book Depository. . . . I have never quite had the same faithand trust in those that lead us as I did before.Sitting on the steps leading to the top of the Grassy Knoll at the time of theassassination was Emmett J. Hudson, one of the groundskeepers of Dealey Plaza.With Hudson were two other men; neither apparently was ever identified by thefederal investigations. In his Warren Commission testimony, Hudson recalled:Well, there was a young fellow, oh, I would judge his age about in his latetwenties. He said he had been looking for a place to park . . . he finally [had]just taken a place over there in one of them parking lots, and he came on downthere and said he worked over there on Industrial and me and him both just satdown there on those steps. When the motorcade turned off of Houston onto Elm, wegot up and stood up, me and him both . . . and so the first shot rung out and,of course, I didn’t realize it was a shot . . . the motorcade had done gotfurther on down Elm. . . . I happened to be looking right at him when thatbullet hit him—the second shot. . . . It looked like it hit him somewhere alongabout a little bit behind the ear and a little above the ear [on the right-handside of his head]. . . . This young fellow that was . . . standing there with me. . . he says, “Lay down, mister, somebody is shooting the President.” . . . Hekept on repeating, “Lay down,” so he was already laying down one way on thesidewalk, so I just laid down over on the ground and resting my arm on theground . . . when that third shot rung out. . . . You could tell the shot wascoming from above and kind of behind.In his testimony, Hudson plainly tried to tell Commission attorney Liebeler thatthe shots came “from above and kind of behind” him, the location of the picketfence on the Grassy Knoll. Liebeler led Hudson, saying, “And that would fit inwith the Texas School Book Depository, wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” replied an agreeable Hudson. Liebeler then asked Hudson if he saw anyonestanding in the area with a rifle “on a grassy spot up there near where you werestanding or on the overpass or any place else?”Hudson replied, “I never seen anyone with a gun up there except the patrols.”Asked Liebeler, “The policemen?”“Yes, sir,” replied Hudson.In an affidavit signed the day of the assassination, Hudson was even morespecific as to where shots came from. He stated, “The shots that I hearddefinitely came from behind and above me.”Sitting near the midway point of the steps leading to the top of the GrassyKnoll, a location “behind and above” would be the exact position of theeasternmost leg of the wooden picket fence.Hudson said he did not know the young man who sat with him and, apparently, thefederal authorities were never able to locate him.The third man appears behind Hudson in photographs taken in the seconds duringwhich the head shot occurs. He, too, has been unidentified but, perhaps, is theexplanation for one of the enduring assassination mysteries.The Black Dog Man [Contents.html#rsec15]In at least two photographs taken during the assassination by separatephotographers, a human figure is visible behind a low retaining wall to thesouth of the Grassy Knoll pergola just behind Zapruder’s position. In photosmade seconds later, this figure has disappeared, leading many assassinationresearchers to suspect that this figure may have been an assassin. Thissuspicion was heightened when the House Select Committee on Assassinations hadphotographs of the figure computer enhanced and concluded that it indeed wasthat of a person, who appeared to be holding a long object.With no known identity, this person was dubbed the “black dog man” byresearchers and committee staffers because in a photo taken by Phil Willis thefigure resembles a black dog sitting on its haunches atop the wall. Closerexamination of the photos, however, indicates the figure is most likely fartherback from the retaining wall. And this may provide a partial answer to thefigure’s identity.In photos of the assassination, a third man can be seen joining Hudson and hiscompanion on the steps of the Grassy Knoll just as the presidential limousinearrives opposite them on Elm Street. Within scant seconds of the fatal headshot, the third man lifts his left foot and within seconds has disappeared backup the steps.Life magazine, in its November 24, 1967, issue, displays the photographs of HughBetzner and Phil Willis and comments:A dark shape is seen in both pictures on the slope—which has become famous asthe “Grassy Knoll”—to the left of the Stemmons Freeway sign and half hidden by aconcrete wall. By photogrammetry Itek has verified it as the figure of a man.Previously published photographs, taken at the moment of the fatal head shot,show that by then he had joined two men seen in Willis’ picture standing behinda lamppost at left. There is no evidence to indicate he was anything more thanan onlooker.So the riddle of the “black dog man” appeared solved. It was the figure of a manseen from waist up as he stood or walked on the sidewalk behind the retainingwall approaching the top of the steps. Yet today many assassination researchersstill deny it was the man who joined Hudson.Seconds later—as determined in photographs—the unidentified man joined Hudsonand companion, who were apparently unaware of the man behind them, then turnedand ran back up the steps immediately after the head shot.However, this explanation does not exonerate the third man as simply an“onlooker.” Who was he? Where did he come from? What did he see both before andafter he joined the two men on the steps? And why did he turn and race back upthe steps (he was gone within seconds) at a time when everyone else in DealeyPlaza was stationary with shock?The federal investigations could provide no answers to these questions, so inthe minds of some researchers, the “black dog man” joins the ranks of suspiciouspersons in Dealey Plaza.[images/line.jpg]Almost immediately after the final shot was fired, many people—includingpolicemen, sheriff’s deputies, and spectators—began rushing toward the GrassyKnoll.Dallas motorcycle officer Bobby Hargis thought the shots had come from theTriple Underpass because “I had got splattered, with blood [and] I was just alittle back and left of Mrs. Kennedy, but I didn’t know.”Hargis stopped his motorcycle on the south side of Elm and ran up the GrassyKnoll to where the concrete wall of the Triple Underpass connected with thewooden picket fence on the knoll. Peering over the wall, Hargis looked at thecrowd standing on the Underpass. Asked if he saw anything out of the ordinary,Hargis told the Warren Commission, “No, I didn’t. That is what got me.”Hargis returned to his still-running motorcycle and rode through the TripleUnderpass. He told the commission, “I couldn’t see anything that was of asuspicious nature, so I came back to the Texas School Book Depository. At thattime it seemed like the activity was centered around the . . . Depository.”Seymour Weitzman was a college graduate serving as a deputy constable of DallasCounty. He had been standing with deputy constable Bill Hutton at the corner ofMain and Houston when the motorcade passed. The pair had turned to walk to anearby courthouse when Weitzman heard three shots, “first one, then . . . alittle period in between . . . [then] the second two seemed to besimultaneously.” He told the Warren Commission:I immediately ran toward the President’s car. Of course, it was speeding awayand somebody said the shots or firecrackers . . . we still didn’t know thePresident was shot . . . came from the wall. I immediately scaled the wall. . .. Apparently, my hands grabbed steam pipes. I burned them. [In the railroadyards behind the picket fence.] We noticed numerous kinds of footprints that didnot make sense because they were going different directions . . . [with Weitzmanat the time were] other officers, Secret Service as well.Behind Weitzman came Dallas policeman Joe M. Smith, who had been handlingtraffic at the intersection of Elm and Houston in front of the Depository. Smithhad helped at the scene of the strange seizure incident minutes before themotorcade arrived and had returned to his position in the middle of Elm wherebarricades had been placed to halt traffic.Moments after the president’s car passed him, Smith heard shots, but he couldn’ttell from which direction they came. He told the Warren Commission a hystericalwoman ran up to him, crying, “They are shooting the president from the bushes!”Smith said he immediately went up the short street that branches off of Elm infront of the Depository and entered the parking lot behind the wooden picketfence. He told the Commission:I looked into all the cars and checked around the bushes. Of course, I wasn’talone. There was some deputy sheriff [Weitzman] with me, and I believe oneSecret Service man when I got there. I got to make this statement, too. I feltawfully silly, but after the shot and this woman, [I] pulled my pistol from myholster, and I thought, this is silly, I don’t know who I am looking for, andput it back. Just as I did, he showed me that he was a Secret Service agent. . .. He saw me coming with my pistol and right away he showed me who he was.In 1978, Smith told author Anthony Summers that “around the hedges [lining theparking lot], there was the smell, the lingering smell of gunpowder.”Smith then moved toward the Triple Underpass because “it sounded to me like they[shots] may have come from this vicinity here.” In his testimony, Smith said hesaw “two other officers there,” but it is unclear if he was speaking aboutbehind the fence or the Triple Underpass. After fifteen or twenty minutes, Smithsaid he returned to the front of the Depository, where he helped other officersseal the building.For some unexplained reason, at the end of his testimony Commission attorneyWesley Liebeler suddenly asked Smith if there was any reason why thepresidential motorcade could not have gone straight down Main Street and turnedonto Stemmons Freeway on its way to the Trade Mart. “As far as I know, there isno reason,” replied Smith. This was a question that has been asked by severalsecurity-conscious researchers over the years. Although not the normal flow oftraffic, a straight run down Main would have made the dogleg turns on Houstonand Elm Streets unnecessary and might have prevented the assassination.One witness who was in a position to observe the area behind the picket fencewas Lee Bowers, a railroad supervisor who was stationed in a tower just north ofthe Grassy Knoll. Bowers told a fascinating story of suspicious cars moving inthe sealed-off railroad yards minutes before the motorcade arrived and of seeingstrange men behind the picket fence. Incredibly, his testimony takes less thansix pages of the Warren Commission volumes.Bowers, an ex-Navy man who had studied religion at Southern Methodist Universityin Dallas, was working for the Union Terminal Company, controlling the movementof trains in the railroad yards from a tower about fourteen feet off the ground.The tower is located about fifty yards northwest of the back of the Texas SchoolBook Depository. A block-long street breaks off from Elm and passes in front ofthe Depository, ending in a parking lot bordered on the south by the woodenpicket fence atop the Grassy Knoll. It was the only paved artery in or out ofthe parking area.Bowers told the Warren Commission:The area had been covered by police for some two hours. Since approximately 10o’clock in the morning [of the assassination], traffic had been cut off into thearea so that anyone moving around could actually be observed. Since I had workedthere for a number of years, I was familiar with most of the people who came inand out of the area. . . . There were three cars that came in during the timefrom around noon until the time of the shooting. They came into the vicinity ofthe tower, which was at the extension of Elm Street . . . which there is no wayout. It is not a through street to anywhere.Bowers said he noticed the first car about 12:10 p.m. It was a blue-and-white1959 Oldsmobile station wagon with out-of-state license plates and some bumperstickers, “one of which was a Goldwater sticker.” The station wagon circled infront of the railroad tower “as if he was searching for a way out, or waschecking the area, and then proceeded back through the only way he could, thesame outlet he came into.”About 12:20 p.m., a black 1957 Ford with Texas license plates came into thearea. Inside was “one male . . . that seemed to have a mike or telephone orsomething. . . . He was holding something up to his mouth with one hand and hewas driving with the other.” Bowers said this car left after three or fourminutes, driving back in front of the Depository. “He did probe a little furtherinto the area than the first car,” he added.Minutes before the assassination, Bowers said a third car—this one a white 1961or 1962 Chevrolet four-door Impala—entered the area. Bowers said:[It] showed signs of being on the road. . . . It was muddy up to the windows,bore a similar out-of-state license to the first car I observed [and was] alsooccupied by one white male. He spent a little more time in the area. . . . Hecircled the area and probed one spot right at the tower . . . and was forced toback out some considerable distance, and slowly cruised down back towards thefront of the School Depository Building. . . . The last I saw of him, he waspausing just about in—just above the assassination site. . . . Whether itcontinued on . . . or whether it pulled up only a short distance, I couldn’ttell. I was busy.Bowers said about eight minutes later, he caught sight of the presidentiallimousine as it turned onto Elm Street. He stated:I heard three shots. One, then a slight pause, then two very close together.Also, reverberation from the shots. . . . The sounds came either from up againstthe School Depository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass.Bowers said he saw two men standing directly between his vantage point and theTriple Underpass, but they “gave no appearance of being together” although theywere only ten or fifteen feet from each other. He described this pair:One man, middle-aged, or slightly older, fairly heavyset, in a white shirt,fairly dark trousers. Another younger man, about mid-twenties, in either a plaidshirt or plaid coat or jacket. . . . They were facing and looking up toward Mainand Houston and following the caravan as it came down.Bowers also saw the railroad employees and the two Dallas policemen standing onthe Triple Underpass. Toward the eastern end of the parking lot, Bowers saw twoother men. He said, “Each had uniforms similar to those custodians at thecourthouse.” Bowers then described what he saw following the shots:At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion, and immediatelyfollowing there was a motorcycle policeman who shot nearly all of the way to thetop of the incline. . . . He was part of the motorcade and had left it for somereason, which I did not know. . . . He came up into the area where there aresome trees and where I had described the two men were in the general vicinity ofthis . . . one of them was [still there]. The other one, I could not say. Thedarker-dressed man was too hard to distinguish from the trees. The one in thewhite shirt, yes, I think he was.Asked by Commission attorney Joseph Ball to describe the “commotion” thatattracted his attention, Bowers said:I just am unable to describe rather than it was something out of the ordinary .. . but something occurred in this particular spot which was out of theordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason, which I could not identify. .. . Nothing that I could pinpoint as having happened that—Ball interrupted. “Afterwards did a good many people come up there on this highground at the tower?” he asked, before Bowers could tell what caught hisattention on the knoll.In a later filmed interview, Bowers did describe what caught his eye. He stated:At the time of the shooting, in the vicinity of where the two men I havedescribed were, there was a flash of light or . . . something I could notidentify . . . some unusual occurrence—a flash of light or smoke or somethingwhich caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there.Bowers said after the shooting, “a large number of people” converged on theparking lot behind the picket fence, including “between fifty and a hundredpolicemen within a maximum of five minutes.” He added, “[Police] sealed off thearea and I held off the trains until they could be examined, and there were sometransients taken [off] at least one train.”One witness who may have encountered one or more of the men Bowers saw behindthe picket fence was Gordon Arnold, who never testified to either of the federalpanels investigating the assassination. On the day of the assassination, Arnoldwas a twenty-two-year-old soldier who had just arrived back in Dallas after Armytraining. He went downtown to have lunch when he decided to take movies of thepresident. Parking his car near Bowers’s railroad tower, Arnold took his moviecamera and walked toward the Triple Underpass. He told this author:I was walking along behind this picket fence when a man in a light-colored suitcame up to me and said I shouldn’t be up there. I was young and cocky and Isaid, “Why not?” And he showed me a badge and said he was with the SecretService and that he didn’t want anyone up there. I said all right and startedwalking back along the fence. I could feel that he was following me and we had afew more words. I walked around to the front of the fence and found a littlemound of dirt to stand on to see the motorcade. . . . Just after the car turnedonto Elm and started toward me, a shot went off from over my left shoulder. Ifelt the bullet, rather than heard it, and it went right past my left ear. . . .I had just gotten out of basic training. In my mind live ammunition was beingfired. It was being fired over my head. And I hit the dirt. I buried my head inthe ground and I heard several other shots, but I couldn’t see anything becauseI had my face in the dirt. [His prone position under the trees on the knoll mayexplain why Arnold did not appear in photographs taken of the knoll at thattime.] I heard two shots and then there was a blend. For a single-bolt action[rifle], he had to have been firing darn good because I don’t think anybodycould fire that rapid a bolt action. . . . The next thing I knew, someone waskicking my butt and telling me to get up. It was a policeman. And I told him togo jump in the river. And then this other guy—a policeman—comes up with a gun. Idon’t recall if it was a shotgun or what. And he was crying and that thing waswaving back and forth. I felt threatened. One of them asked me if I had takenany film and I said yes. He told me to give him my film, so I tossed him mycamera. I said you can have everything, just point that gun somewhere else. Heopened it, pulled out the film, and then threw the camera back to me. All Iwanted to do was get out of there. The gun and the guy crying was enough tounnerve me.Arnold ran straight back to his car and drove out of the parking areaunchallenged. Two days later, Arnold reported to duty at Fort Wainwright inAlaska and he did not return for several years.Arnold’s presence on the Grassy Knoll has been questioned by some researchersbecause he doesn’t appear in photographs taken that day. His position well underthe overhanging trees on the knoll left him in deep shadow. He was seen,however, by at least one person in the presidential motorcade. Former senatorRalph Yarborough, who was riding in the same car as Vice President Johnson,confirmed Arnold’s position in 1978 when he told the Dallas Morning News:Immediately on the firing of the first shot I saw the man you interviewed[Arnold] throw himself on the ground. He was down within a second of the timethe shot was fired and I thought to myself, “There’s a combat veteran who knowshow to act when weapons start firing.”Arnold, later an investigator for the Dallas Department of Consumer Affairs, didnot give his name to authorities and was never questioned by either the WarrenCommission or the House Select Committee on Assassinations, although his accountof the assassination appeared in the July 27, 1978, edition of the DallasMorning News.Corroboration of Arnold’s story may have come in 1982 with discovery of a figurein the background of a snapshot made at the instant of the fatal head shot toKennedy by a woman standing on the south curb on Elm Street.The Badge Man [Contents.html#rsec16]Mary Moorman took a now well-known Polaroid picture just as Kennedy was struckin the head. She sold her rights to the photo that day to United PressInternational for $600. The photo was never examined or printed by the WarrenCommission, but it was published widely in newspapers and magazines after theassassination.For years, researchers pored over the Moorman picture looking for evidence of aGrassy Knoll gunman. Despite some tantalizingly blurry objects discovered alongthe top of the west leg of the picket fence, no credible photo of a gunman wasfound.The House Select Committee on Assassinations did study the picture, but found ithad badly faded and “was of quite poor quality.” However, because of acousticalevidence indicating a shot from the Grassy Knoll, the committee recommended“this particular photograph should be reexamined.”Then, in 1982, Texas researchers Gary Mack, now curator of the Sixth FloorMuseum in Dallas, and Jack White, who died in 2012, began studying the Moormanphoto in light of Gordon Arnold’s experience. After obtaining a clear slide madefrom an original, good-quality copy of Moorman’s photo, they began studying thebushy area east from the corner of the fence. It was here they discovered whatappeared to be two figures. Interestingly, the figures appear in the samegeneral area that the House committee’s acoustical tests indicated shots werefired from, though the sound experts located a shot west of the corner of thefence, while the figures are north of the corner.When blown up, the figures are detectable even by untrained observers. Onepolice official even commented that one man seemed to be wearing “shooter’sglasses.” The main figure has been dubbed “badge man” because he appears to bewearing a dark shirt with a semicircular patch on the left shoulder and a brightshiny object on his left chest—the exact configuration of a Dallas policeuniform.Although the “badge man’s” hairline, eyes, left ear, and jaw are visible, hismouth and neck are obscured by a bright spot—apparently the smoke or muzzleflash from a rifle he is holding in the classic rifle-firing position.After analyzing the photographic blowup as well as making reenactment photos inDealey Plaza, Mack and White felt the “badge man” and perhaps even a companionwere standing behind the wooden picket fence about fifteen feet north from thecorner. This places the figure just to the left of Gordon Arnold’s position andto the right and rear of Abraham Zapruder.In the 1980s, Mack and White tried unsuccessfully to interest a major newsorganization in financing a scientific analysis of the “badge man” photo.Finally, a national tabloid agreed to have the blowup studied. White and arepresentative from the newsmagazine flew to the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, where the photo was subjected to sophisticated computer enhancement.They were told that, without question, the photo showed a man firing a rifle.The next day, however, the chairman of the MIT department involved suddenly gaveall materials back to them and, with no explanation, told them the school wouldno longer participate in any study of the photo.The “badge man” blowup was included in The Men Who Killed Kennedy, a Britishtelevision documentary by Nigel Turner produced in 1988. In this program, “badgeman” was identified as a professional Corsican assassin named Lucien Sarti. Thisdocumentary, which was nominated for awards in Britain and shown to millions ofpeople around the world, was not aired in the United States until the early1990s when it was purchased by the Arts & Entertainment Company and shown on itsHistory Channel after being broken into a series of programs slated to be showneach November until the fiftieth anniversary in 2013.One of these programs, aired in 2003, “The Guilty Men,” implicated Lyndon B.Johnson in the JFK assassination and was thus roundly criticized by survivingJohnson associates, including his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, who died in 2007.Also among the critics was the last surviving member of the Warren Commissionand the only appointed US president, Gerald R. Ford. After this group threatenedlegal action, the History Channel had three historians review the offendingprogram. These eminent Establishment historians included Robert Dallek, aretired history professor at Boston University who since 1996 was a visitingprofessor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas atAustin; Stanley Kutler, a Guggenheim Fellow and history professor best known forhis lawsuit against the National Archives that resulted in the release ofPresident Nixon’s Watergate tapes; and Thomas Surgue, a graduate of ColumbiaUniversity and King’s College, Cambridge, receiving grants from the GuggenheimFoundation, the Brookings Institution, and the American Philosophical Society,among others. Although some of the persons interviewed for the programs inquestion said they and their material had never been questioned, thisEstablishment panel concluded the offending program was not credible and shouldnot have been aired. After offering a public apology, the History Channelwithdrew the program from distribution.Also withdrawn without any explanation were two other programs, the one onCorsican assassin Lucien Sarti and the other dealing with Judyth Vary Baker, whoclaimed to have been with Lee Oswald in New Orleans, both working for elementswithin the US government.The “badge man” has been largely ignored in assassination literature anddocumentaries. In a 2008 documentary on the Discovery Channel titled JFK: Insidethe Target Car, Gary Mack stated there was no one behind the wooden picketfence, apparently forgetting that he was instrumental in making public the“badge man” analysis. He also misdirected the audience to the long stretch offence rather than the shorter one, the location of the figure in the photograph.But the cumulative evidence indicating that the “badge man” may indeed have beenthe Grassy Knoll gunman is supported by the following accounts:—Gordon Arnold’s story of hearing a shot come from his left rear.—Zapruder’s testimony that shots came from his right rear.—Bowers’s testimony that he saw a flash of light and smoke near two men wearinguniforms near the east end of the fence.—The House Select Committee on Assassinations, which placed at least one shotwithin ten feet of the fence corner (although on the west leg).—Jean Hill, who said she saw smoke and movement north of the fence corner at themoment of the head shot.—Sam Holland and others who told of finding muddy footprints, cigarette butts,and mud on a car bumper behind the picket fence minutes after the shots werefired.—Numerous witnesses who ran behind the fence but said they saw only railroadworkers and policemen there.—The testimony of Emmett Hudson, Constable Weitzman, and Officer Smith, all ofwhom saw policemen on the knoll when there were none officially accounted for inthat area.All in all, the photographic blowup of these figures on the knoll may be themost important evidence yet confirming the existence of assassins on the GrassyKnoll. In any other case, if there was a photograph of a shooter behind thefence, two separate acoustical studies confirming at least one shot from behindthe fence and a large number of witnesses who said a shot came from behind thefence, anyone arguing that no shots were fired from behind the fence would beconsidered an idiot. But this is the Kennedy assassination and some continue tosay the deed was committed only by Lee Oswald firing from the sixth floor of theDepository.Curiously, no official government agency or major news organization has beenwilling to either make a serious study of the Moorman photo or present the phototo the general public. Further evidence of what went on behind the picket fenceat the moment of the assassination can be found in the little-known story of acrucial witness.[images/line.jpg]A Grassy Knoll Witness [Contents.html#rsec17]It is strange irony that the one person who apparently witnessed men with gunsbehind the wooden picket fence on the Grassy Knoll at the time of the Kennedyassassination was unable to tell anyone what he saw. Ed Hoffman of Dallas wasdeaf since birth and, as is common with that disability, he cannot speak.However, this did not prevent him from attempting to alert authorities to whathe saw behind that fence.Although Hoffman told his family and friends what he saw at the time and laterreported it to the FBI, his story remained unpublicized over the years. Finally,in the summer of 1985, he told his story to this author. It was latersubstantially confirmed by FBI documents. Ed Hoffman died on March 24, 2010.Virgil Edward Hoffman was twenty-six years old on November 22, 1963, and atnoontime was driving toward downtown Dallas on the Stemmons Freeway when henoticed numerous people lining the freeway. He suddenly realized that PresidentKennedy was to motorcade through the city that day, so he stopped his car justnorth of a railroad bridge across Stemmons and joined the spectators.It should be noted that, since all news coverage of the motorcade stopped afterthe shooting in Dealey Plaza, only someone who was there that day could haveknown that many people were lining Stemmons to get a glimpse of the president.After waiting for a time, Hoffman decided to walk along the shoulder of thefreeway to a point where it crossed over Elm Street in hopes of getting a viewinto Dealey Plaza. From this vantage point, Hoffman was approximately twohundred yards west of the parking lot behind the picket fence at an elevation ofabout the height of the first floor of the Texas School Book Depository.Being unable to hear, he was not aware that Kennedy’s motorcade was passingthrough the plaza. However, he was aware of movement on the north side of thepicket fence. He became aware of a man running west along the back side of thefence wearing a dark suit and a tie. The man was carrying a rifle in his hands.As the man reached a metal-pipe railing at the west end of the fence, he tossedthe rifle to a second man standing on the west side of the pipe near therailroad tracks that went south over the Triple Underpass. The second man waswearing light coveralls and a railroad worker’s hat.The second man caught the rifle, ducked behind a large railroad switch box—oneof two at that site—and knelt down. The man disassembled the rifle, placed it ina soft brown bag (Hoffman’s description matches that of the traditional railroadbrakeman’s tool bag), then walked nonchalantly north into the rail yards in thegeneral direction of the railroad tower containing Lee Bowers.The man in the suit, meanwhile, had turned and run back along the picket fenceuntil midway, when he stopped and began walking calmly toward the corner of thefence. Hoffman could not see the corner due to cars and overhanging treebranches.Unable to hear, Hoffman was at a loss to understand what was happening as hewatched these men.However, moments later Kennedy’s car came into sight out of the west side of theTriple Underpass. Hoffman saw the president lying on the seat of theblood-splattered car and realized something terrible had occurred.As the presidential limousine turned onto the Stemmons access ramp just belowhis position, Hoffman tried to alert the Secret Service agents to what he hadwitnessed. He ran down the grassy incline waving his arms and trying to makethem understand that he had seen something, when one of the agents in thepresident’s follow-up car produced a “machine gun,” which he leveled at him.Hoffman stopped and threw up his hands and could only watch helplessly as themotorcade rushed past him onto Stemmons in the mad rush to Parkland Hospital.There was no mention at the time of any Secret Service man with a machine gun,yet Hoffman was emphatic that it was an automatic weapon with a pistol grip,carrying handle, and clip. It is now known that Secret Service agent George W.Hickey Jr. in the follow-up car did display an AR-15, the civilian model of theM-16 automatic rifle, further corroborating Hoffman’s story.Upset over what he had seen, Hoffman looked around for help. He saw a Dallaspoliceman standing on the railroad bridge crossing Stemmons and he walked towardhim waving his arms in an attempt to communicate what he had seen. However, thepoliceman, unable to understand, simply waved him off. This part of Hoffman’sstory also is partially corroborated, since policeman Earle Brown filed a reportstating that he was on the Stemmons railroad bridge at the time of theassassination. However, questioned recently about these events, Brown said hehas no recollection of seeing Hoffman.Unable to get help, Hoffman walked back to his car and drove behind the TexasSchool Book Depository for several minutes trying to locate the man with therifle in the brown bag. He was unsuccessful. However, this indicates the totallack of security around the Depository in the chaotic minutes following theassassination. Hoffman was able to drive around in the rail yards behind theDepository for some time and then leave without being stopped or questioned byauthorities.He then drove to the Dallas FBI office but found no one there except areceptionist. He left his name and address with the FBI. The FBI neverresponded.At the time, Hoffman had a relative at the Dallas police station, and he drovethere next, hoping to find some help. However, the station was sealed off andthe officer on the door refused to allow him to enter.Thwarted in his attempts to tell authorities what he had seen, Hoffman finallywent home, where his parents, also deaf and mute, urged him not to becomeinvolved.Hoffman said nothing until Thanksgiving 1963, when he met his policeman relativeat a family function. Despite his parents’ warnings, he told his story to Dallaspoliceman Robert Hoffman, who assured him that the federal authorities wereinvestigating the case and that, in fact, the assassin had already been caught.Robert Hoffman later explained:I know that Eddie’s a very bright person and always has been, and can’t think ofany reason why he would make up something like this. . . . His father was very,very concerned that Eddie knew anything about the assassination at all. It wastime when suspicions were running high and he was worried about Eddie gettinginvolved in any way. . . . It just wasn’t a time for loose statements thatcouldn’t be proved or backed up with any evidence.Confident that he had done his civic duty and that the case was closed, EdHoffman said he didn’t consider telling his story to anyone else.However, as the years went by, Hoffman became more and more aware of theofficial version of the assassination and knew that the theory that one man hadfired from the sixth floor of the Depository did not agree with what he hadseen.Finally on June 28, 1967, at the urging of coworkers, Hoffman visited the DallasFBI once again. Apparently Hoffman had difficulty in communicating with theagents or they purposely distorted his story, because the FBI report of that daystates:Hoffman said he observed two white males, clutching something dark to theirchests with both hands, running from the rear of the Texas School BookDepository building. The men were running north on the railroad, then turnedeast, and Hoffman lost sight of both of the men.The report added:Approximately two hours after the above interview with Hoffman, he returned tothe Dallas office of the FBI and advised he had just returned from the spot onStemmons Freeway where he had parked his automobile and had decided he could nothave seen the men running because of a fence west of the Texas School BookDepository building. He said it was possible that he saw these two men on thefence or something else [sic].Whether or not the FBI agents were able to understand Hoffman correctly, theydid talk to his father and brother on July 5, 1967. Both said Hoffman lovedPresident Kennedy and had told his story to them just after the assassination.However, they also said Hoffman “has in the past distorted facts of eventsobserved by him.” Of course, it was his father who had urged him not to becomeinvolved in the case at all, so there was motivation to downplay his son’sstory.Officially, this was the end of any investigation into Hoffman’s story at thattime. Unofficially, Hoffman said one FBI agent told him to keep quiet about whathe had seen or “you might get killed.”Despite this not-so-subtle attempt to silence Hoffman, he continued to tell hisstory to fellow workers at the Dallas electronics firm where he was employedsince before the assassination. Hoffman retired in the late 1990s and died inMarch 2010.On March 25, 1977, one of Hoffman’s supervisors who understood sign languagecontacted the Dallas FBI office. He said he felt that the FBI did not fullyunderstand what Hoffman was trying to tell them during the 1967 interview andthat Hoffman deserved to be heard.At this urging, FBI agents again talked with Hoffman on March 28, 1977, and evenaccompanied him to the site on Stemmons Freeway. This time, with his supervisoracting as translator, Hoffman was able to give more details. He said he thoughthe saw a puff of smoke near where the men were standing, and essentially hisstory was the same as the one he told in 1985 except he said he saw both men runnorth into the rail yards.Although this time the FBI took photographs of the area based on Hoffman’stestimony, they again showed little interest in pursuing his story.On the cover sheet of their report to the FBI director, the Dallas agents wrote:On Pages 71–76 [Chapter002a.html#page_71] of the Report of the President’sCommission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the witnesses atthe Triple Underpass are discussed, but the Warren Commission’s investigationhas disclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere otherthan the Texas School Book Depository building. In view of the above, the DallasOffice is conducting no additional investigation.In other words, since the federal government concluded Oswald was the loneassassin, Hoffman must have been mistaken. The agents were careful to include intheir report his father’s opinion: “The father of Virgil Hoffman stated that hedid not believe that his son has seen anything of value and doubted he hadobserved any men running from the Texas School Book Depository.”Such dismissiveness might account for the fact that there was no mention ofHoffman or his testimony by the US government until researchers obtained reportson him through the Freedom of Information Act in 1985.Since Hoffman, despite his hearing disability, appears to be a most crediblewitness and since his story only reinforces those of others who told of gunmenon the knoll, it deserves serious consideration. However, as late as 2007, somewere still sniping at Hoffman’s account. M. Duke Lane argued that surely thepolicemen on or near Stemmons Freeway would have reported Hoffman’s attempts togain their attention. Despite the fact that everyone, including witnesses inDealey Plaza, did not realize what had happened for several minutes and policethere had already released traffic stopped for the motorcade, Lane wrote:During this time, because of their proximity to the Triple Underpass, theofficers were undoubtedly on the lookout for anything that might have seemedsuspicious in any way, or even just out of the ordinary: after all, thePresident had just been “hit” and was on his way to the hospital; the shooter orshooters might still be in the area. The police were not taking chances. . . .While it may be somehow possible that Ed saw and approached none of them, it isimplausible that none of them saw him, made no moves to detain him at any time,and simply let him speed away in his car. . . . We’re left with the inescapableconclusion that the Ed Hoffman tale . . . is nothing more than a tale, a figmentof the imagination of a humble and otherwise unassuming man who, for whateverreason, got caught up in a story possibly not of his own making, but whichnevertheless created and sustained that “fifteen minutes of fame” all men aresaid to be entitled to.Such an ad hominem attack would seem ill supported since many of the details inHoffman’s story have been independently corroborated—the crowds on Stemmons, theautomatic rifle, the cop on the railroad bridge, and the testimony of JessePrice, who saw a man running behind the picket fence from the roof of the UnionTerminal Annex. His account may be the best version to date of what happenedbehind the picket fence. Hoffman’s experience also serves as a vivid commentaryon the FBI’s failure to follow serious leads, the bureau’s attempts tointimidate witnesses into silence. and the unremitting attacks on anyone whowould dare challenge the official government version of assassination events.In reviewing the experiences of the people in Dealey Plaza the day Kennedy died,it is apparent that not one single person saw the assassination as it wasdescribed by the government’s investigations.In the motorcade, Governor Connally’s testimony—totally corroborated by theZapruder film—indicated that both he and Kennedy could not have been struck bythe same bullet.Many people, including Sheriff Decker, Royce Skelton, and Austin Miller, saw onebullet strike Elm Street. Others, like Policeman Foster, saw a bullet hit thegrass on the south side of Elm.Some heard shots coming from at least two separate locations, while those on theTriple Underpass even saw smoke drift out from under the trees on the GrassyKnoll. Still others reported a bullet strike on the Stemmons Freeway sign.Motorcade riders heard shots from separate locations, but the majority believedshots came from the direction of the Triple Underpass. Both Sheriff Decker andPolice Chief Curry ordered their men to rush to the railroad yards behind theGrassy Knoll.Despite great efforts on the part of authorities to establish the Depository asthe source of all shots, public attention—both in 1963 and today—kept returningto the infamous Grassy Knoll."},{"pageContent":"PART II [Contents.html#rpa2][images/f0089-01.jpg]MEANS, MOTIVES, AND OPPORTUNITIES [Contents.html#rpa2]The assassination of president John F. Kennedy was not an isolated event. Itoccurred within a complex matrix of national and international events andissues. Therefore, for any truthful understanding, the assassination must beplaced within a context of the times.As president, Kennedy daily was juggling a wide variety of responsibilities onmany different fronts—foreign policy, civil rights, agriculture, finance,politics, crime-busting, and defense considerations.Likewise, Lee Harvey Oswald—the man identified by two government panels asKennedy’s assassin—did not live isolated from the world of his time. During hisbrief twenty-four years of life, Oswald came into contact with an incrediblearray of groups and individuals, all of whom had reason to wish for theelimination of Kennedy. Beginning with an uncle connected to organized crime,young Oswald moved through a shadowy world of soldiers, intelligence agents fromboth sides of the Cold War, Russian communists and anticommunists, pro-andanti-Castro Cubans, FBI men, and right-wing extremists. To place the events ofNovember 22, 1963, in proper perspective, it is necessary to become familiarwith these groups and with their relationships to Oswald and each other.After all, every good detective begins a murder investigation by determining whohad the means, motive, and opportunity to commit the act. The obvious startingplace is with the one man universally acknowledged as the person most closelyconnected to the assassination—Lee Harvey Oswald."},{"pageContent":"Lee Harvey Oswald—Assassin or Patsy? [Contents.html#rch3]Prior to his enlistment in the Marines and with the possible exception of theearly death of his father, Lee Harvey Oswald’s boyhood was little different fromthat of millions of other Americans.Oswald was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1939, two months afterthe death of his father, Robert E. Lee Oswald, a collector of insurancepremiums. While this unfortunate event must have had some effect on youngOswald, it was a fate endured by thousands of other young Americans, none ofwhom have felt compelled to murder national leaders.In 1945, Oswald’s mother married for a third time, but three years later themarriage ended in divorce. From that point on, Oswald and his brother, Robert,were brought up by their mother, Marguerite.A Mother in History [Contents.html#rsec18]The House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979 concluded that PresidentKennedy was “probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.” However, theymaintained that Lee Harvey Oswald was the actual killer and that anothergunman—whose presence was established by two separate scientific tests based ona Dallas police recording of the gunfire in Dealey Plaza—escaped and remainsunidentified.This finding was a milestone to the many Americans who had come to disbelievethe lone-assassin theory of the Warren Commission.Typically, however, this reversal of official American history was still notenough for the mother of the accused assassin, Marguerite Oswald. She told newsreporters:The committee members have made a first step in the right direction. It’s up tous to do the rest. . . . I hope and know the future will vindicate my sonentirely. It took us 15 years to come this far. It may take another 15 years orlonger. I probably won’t be around, but the world will know that Lee HarveyOswald was innocent of the charges against him.This was the statement of a woman who was much more than merely a supportivemother. It came from a woman who faced more public hostility than mostmurderers—a woman who faced the autumn of her years alone and in poverty. Andall because of a child she bore.Marguerite Claverie was born in New Orleans in 1907, of French and Germandescent. Her mother died a few years after her birth, leaving young Margueriteand her five siblings in the care of her father, a streetcar conductor.According to relatives, the Claverie family was poor but happy.At the age of seventeen, Marguerite completed one year of high school. She thendropped out to become a law-firm receptionist. In August 1929, she marriedEdward John Pic Jr., a clerk. However, the marriage was not successful and thecouple divorced in 1931, several months after the birth of her first son, JohnEdward Pic.In 1933, she married Robert Edward Lee Oswald, himself recently divorced. Shedescribed her marriage to Oswald as the “only happy part” of her life. Out ofthis union came a second son, Robert. Then her happiness came to an end. Twomonths before the birth of Lee Harvey Oswald in October 1939, her husband diedof a sudden heart attack. Making her way alone, she saw an opportunity toestablish a family once again by remarrying in 1945. Sending the two elder sonsoff to boarding school, she and her new husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl, tooksix-year-old Lee and moved to Benbrook, Texas, a small town south of Fort Worth.However, soon there were arguments over money and charges of infidelity againstEkdahl. A divorce was granted in 1948 and she was allowed to use her former nameof Oswald. It is interesting to note that Ekdahl’s divorce attorney was FredKorth, who in the fall of 1963 was fired as secretary of the Navy by PresidentKennedy amid charges that Korth may have been involved along with Lyndon Johnsonin a scandal over the General Dynamics TFX airplane contracts.John Pic and Robert Oswald rejoined their mother, but both soon left home tojoin the military. Marguerite was left with only young Lee. Some accounts sayMarguerite overly mothered Lee, while others claim she neglected the boy.However, the former seems to be closer to the truth in light of the fact thatshe became a practical nurse charged with babysitting the children of prominentTexans such as Amon Carter Jr. and former Texas representative Tom Vandergriff.Despite much conjecture, there is little evidence that Lee’s childhood was anybetter or any worse than many others.Lee dropped out of school to join the Marines. But in 1959, he received a suddendischarge and returned to Fort Worth for a two-day visit with his mother. Leesaid he was off to New Orleans to work for an import-export firm, but severalweeks later Mrs. Oswald read in the newspapers that her twenty-year-old son hadturned up in Russia, where he told US officials he wanted to defect.Instead of branding her son a traitor, she told reporters, “I feel very stronglythat as an individual, he has the right to make his own decision. Lee hasdefinite ideas. I believe God gives us a conscience and the ability to knowright and I feel he has the right to make his own decision.”Despite this motherly support, Lee seemed to make every effort to avoidMarguerite after his return from the Soviet Union in 1962. At one point he movedhis Russian bride and their infant daughter from Fort Worth to Dallas withoutleaving his mother a forwarding address.The family was reunited only briefly during those dark days of November 1963.Mrs. Oswald was on her way to work on November 22 when she heard over the carradio that Kennedy had been shot while riding in a motorcade in downtown Dallas.She also learned that a young ex-Marine named Lee Harvey Oswald was being heldby police as the suspected assassin.Concerned by the broadcasts and apparently with no friends to turn to, shecontacted the local newspaper, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and asked ifsomeone would take her to Dallas. She told reporter Bob Shieffer, who drove herto the Dallas police station, “I want to hear him tell me that he did it.”Mrs. Oswald also told them that she had been persecuted since her son’s journeyto Russia and knew the meaning of suffering. She described being fired by herlast employer, Star-Telegram publisher Amon Carter Jr. She said she had beenacting as a day nurse for the Carters’ children until about two weeks prior tothe Kennedy assassination. The Carters suddenly let her go after arriving backfrom a weekend trip to Las Vegas.She once told this author, “You don’t know what it’s like to have someone lookat you and say, ‘You’ve done a good job, but we no longer need your services.’”She also noted this was the same weekend Jack Ruby was reported visiting in LasVegas.Following the assassination in Dallas, Mrs. Oswald was unable to hear theconfession she sought from her son—she was not allowed to talk with him. AndOswald steadfastly maintained his innocence. He shouted to news reportersgathered in the police station hallway, “No, sir, I didn’t kill anybody. I’mjust a patsy!”After Oswald’s murder by Jack Ruby two days later, his mother’s tone changed toone of suspicion and accusation, blaming the Dallas police and federalauthorities for her son’s death. She asked bitterly, “Why would [ Jack Ruby] beallowed within a few feet of a prisoner—any prisoner—when I could not even seemy own son?”To compound her suspicions, she maintained until her death that the FBI hadshown her a photo of Ruby the night before her son was slain. She said about6:30 p.m. on November 23, the night after the assassination, an FBI agent andanother man knocked on the door of the hotel where she and Lee’s wife were beingkept by the authorities. After being told that her daughter-in-law was tired andcouldn’t talk with the men, the FBI agent asked Marguerite a question. Sherecalled the incident to news reporters a week later:He had a picture coupled [sic] inside his hand and asked me if I had ever seenthat man before. I told him, “No sir, believe me, I never have.” Then he left. Afew days later, I walked into the room where I was staying and, in front of myson Robert and a lot of witnesses, I picked up a paper and when I turned it overI said, “This is the picture of the man that FBI agent showed me.” I did noteven know at the time he was the man who shot my son. I was told that thepicture was [of] Mr. Jack Ruby.FBI officials, when informed of her statement, speculated that she must havebeen confused as to the date she was shown the photograph.On July 10, 1964, FBI agent Bardwell D. Odum signed an affidavit with the WarrenCommission stating that he had shown the picture to Mrs. Oswald. He said thephoto was furnished by FBI superiors, who obtained it from the CIA. The FBI saidthey included the photo as a Warren Commission exhibit. It was reportedlysupplied by the CIA, which was secretly photographing visitors to the Sovietembassy in Mexico City.This incident was the beginning of Mrs. Oswald’s lifelong suspicion of federalauthorities. To the end of her life, she maintained that Lee had been working assome sort of agent for the US government and that unnamed “high officials” werepart of the plot to kill Kennedy and blame her son. After Watergate she told alocal newspaper, “If you called in all the FBI men involved in Lee HarveyOswald’s life and questioned them, one thing would lead to another and it wouldprobably break the assassination case.”Just after the assassination, Mrs. Oswald said, “They [the public] all turnedtheir backs on me before [when Oswald appeared in Russia] and they will turntheir backs on me again, but my faith will see me through.” And faith was trulyabout the only thing left for Mrs. Oswald.With the exception of a couple of mysterious “benefactors” who kept her suppliedwith publications concerning the assassination, Marguerite Oswald was forced tolive through the next two decades on less than $500 a month in Social Securitypayments. In the bicentennial summer of 1976, she was without a refrigerator foralmost two months because she could not afford repairs. The loneliness andpoverty of her life, however, failed to crush her fighting spirit. She continuedto assail the official version of the assassination and to strike out at mediapresentations of the event.In 1978, after viewing a CBS “docudrama” titled Ruby and Oswald, she told thelocal newspaper:I have every right to be upset over that program as well as many other thingsbecause they are talking about my son and my family. They sit there and tell thegullible American public that their program is the truth and based ondocumentation. Well, I’m sitting here with things you’ve never heard of. I cantear that CBS program apart like I did the Warren Commission.Her thoughts on the Warren Commission, whose conclusions were taken as gospel atthe time but gradually lost the confidence of the majority of Americans, aresummed up in a letter Mrs. Oswald wrote to several congressmen in 1973 at theheight of the Watergate crisis:On Nov. 29, 1963, the then President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson,created a commission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding theassassination of President John F. Kennedy and the subsequent killing of thealleged assassin and to report its findings and conclusions to him. . . .President Johnson selected Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States, asits chairman. Because I was critical of the commission, I was asked, “Mrs.Oswald, are you implying that the Chief Justice would whitewash evidence or hideinformation so that the American people, as well as the whole world, would neverlearn the truth?” I answered, yes, in the name of security, men of integrity andwho are the most esteemed, most respected and honored, who have the welfare ofthe country at heart, would be most likely to do what the White House wanted andthought necessary. The Watergate affair has followed this pattern. Those webelieve are above reproach, those who have reached the pinnacle or are near it,those who are guiding our nation’s destiny are found to have manipulated eventsto accomplish certain things they think were for the good of the country. Thosewho have a deep sense of patriotism and loyalty are most likely to twist eventsto accomplish their purposes. . . . The Watergate affair only strengthens myconvictions and proves my theory. [In 1963, the] suspect was my son and sevensuch respected men branded a dead man who was neither tried nor convicted,assassin.Through the years, Mrs. Oswald, who always claimed to be a “mother in history,”was quick to point out that her defense of her son went beyond simple motherlylove. She once told this author, “If he was truly guilty, I can accept that. Butwhether it’s my son or someone else’s son, I want the proof and the proof isjust not there.”In her last years, Mrs. Oswald was virtually a recluse in her modest butwell-kept brick home on the west side of Fort Worth. An occasionalvisitor—usually a journalist—and her small dog, Fritz, were her only company.Neither her other sons nor Lee’s wife, Marina, ever spoke to her again afterNovember 1963. When money problems pressed too hard, she would sell a book or aletter from her mammoth collection of assassination materials. It was such moneyproblems that helped create the belief that Mrs. Oswald would talk only forprofit. However, as several Fort Worth news reporters can confirm, she neverhesitated to pick up her telephone and call the media when a particular newsitem rankled her. She once explained the charge of talk-for-cash this way:Well, here I am without money, wondering where my next meal is coming from andthese writers come to my house wanting an interview. Then they go out and writesome piece—some of them don’t even talk to me more than fifteen minutes orso—and they get all this money for their work. That’s not fair!In January 1981, Mrs. Oswald quietly entered a Fort Worth hospital. Rumorscirculated that she had cancer. By the end of that month, Marguerite ClaverieOswald was dead. Her memorial service was private. She was buried next to Lee ineast Fort Worth’s Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park. But her cause lives on. In oneof her last letters to this author she wrote but one simple sentence: “Again—Thecharges against my late son Lee Harvey Oswald are false.”[images/line.jpg]Oswald’s early life is shrouded in innuendo and misinformation, much of itstemming from the passionate attitudes following the assassination.Anyone who had had any contact with Oswald was hunted down and interviewed bynews reporters and many were deposed by the Warren Commission.And no one, including some family members, had anything good to say about theman accused of killing one of this nation’s most popular presidents.Some examples of misinformation include the Warren Commission’s statement thatMarguerite placed Lee in an “orphan’s home.” While in one respect this is true,a closer look shows that Mrs. Oswald had to work to earn a living for theirfatherless family. Keep in mind there were no daycare centers in 1942.Mrs. Oswald explained to news reporters years later that she placed Robert andLee in the Bethlehem Children’s Home, operated by the Lutheran Church.Admittedly it was also an orphanage, but more precisely, it was the forerunnerof a daycare center. Relatives looked in on the boys and Marguerite saw them onweekends and holidays.Lee’s oldest brother, John Pic, told the Warren Commission that Lee slept withhis mother until almost eleven years old, thus supplying much fodder for laterpsychological speculation. Mrs. Oswald’s version sounds more mundane:[While] I was married . . . Lee had his own bed, of course, all the while. AfterI divorced this man [Ekdahl], all I got from this divorce was $1,500 and I paid$1,000 down on a home. Well, I had to buy furniture. I bought used furniture,and one of the boys slept on an army cot, and the other on a twin bed, and,because of the circumstances, Lee slept with me; which was a short time becausethen his brother joined the service and when he did, Lee took his bed. But itjust implies that all through his life he slept with his mother, which isn’t thecase, you see. It’s quite a difference.Robert Oswald supported his mother’s version of this issue by writing, “If this[sleeping arrangement] had a bad effect on Lee, I’m sure mother didn’t realizeit. She was simply making use of all the space she had.”Much was made of Oswald’s truancy in New York during 1953–1954, as well as thepsychological testing resulting from this infraction.In the summer of 1952, shortly before Lee’s thirteenth birthday, he and hismother had gone to live with his half-brother, John Pic, and his wife in NewYork City, where Pic was stationed with the Coast Guard. There were reports offights and divisions within the family and by the start of the school year, Leeand his mother had moved into their own apartment in the Bronx.This whole scenario is problematic, as there appears to have been a Lee Oswaldattending school in both New York and New Orleans at this same time. The Lee inNew York was teased in junior high school because he wore jeans and spoke with aTexas accent, so he began staying away. However, unlike most truants who endedup in pools halls or street gangs, Lee continued his education on his own,frequenting the local library and the zoo. Finally caught, the youngster washanded over for psychiatric observation to an institution called Youth House.Here he stayed from April 16 until May 7, 1953. Mrs. Oswald said it was onlyafter having both her gifts and her person searched for cigarettes and narcoticsthat she realized Youth House was one step short of jail. She said her sonimplored her, “Mother, I want to get out of here. There are children in here whohave killed people and smoke. I want to get out.”While under the care of the state, Oswald was given psychiatric tests. Theresults were essentially inconclusive. They showed him to be a bright andinquisitive young man who was somewhat tense, withdrawn, and hesitant to talkabout himself or his feelings.Even the Warren Report, which generally tried to depict Oswald in the worstpossible light, conceded:Contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination, the psychiatricexamination did not indicate that Lee Oswald was a potential assassin,potentially dangerous, that “his outlook on life had strongly paranoidovertones,” or that he should be institutionalized.Yet this innocuous event was used against Oswald in a widely publicized 1993book by Gerald Posner titled Case Closed. Posner quoted Youth House staffpsychiatrist Dr. Renatus Hartogs as declaring young Oswald “to have definitetraits of dangerousness.” Posner said Hartogs “vividly remembered Oswald elevenyears later when he testified to the Warren Commission.” However, Hartogs, whocame to the United States from Germany just before World War II and became acitizen in 1945, actually told the Commission he only “vaguely” rememberedOswald but found him “polite” and “in full contact with reality.” When asked ifhe had any independent recollection of the Oswald interview, Hartogs replied, “Iwas able to reconstruct the picture of the boy.” Contradicting the WarrenReport, Hartogs told Posner he recommended Oswald be institutionalized. But thenhe also failed to recall young Oswald until well after the assassination when aNew York Times reporter came to him and asked if he had examined young Lee. “Isaid that I did not know for sure, but it is possible. . . . Then very soon theFBI came in here and said you were the doctor who examined Oswald and from thenon I knew for sure that it was me.”According to the official history, after his experience in Youth House therewere no further truancy problems with young Lee. In January 1954, Lee and hismother returned to New Orleans, where he finished the ninth grade and began thetenth. Upon arriving in New Orleans, the Oswalds lived initially with Mrs.Oswald’s sister and her husband, Lillian and Charles “Dutz” Murret, beforefinding an apartment of their own.Everyone who knew Oswald as a youth agrees that he was somewhat introverted andwas what could be best described as a “bookworm.” His interests were varied,including animals, astronomy, classic literature, and eventually, politics.Reading comic books and listening to radio and TV were also among his favoritepastimes.Robert Oswald later recalled:One of his favorite [TV] programs was “I Led Three Lives,” the story of HerbertPhilbrick, the FBI informant who posed as a communist spy. In the early 1950’sLee watched that show every week without fail. When I left home to join theMarines, he was still watching the reruns.There can be little doubt that the well-read but lonely young Oswald spent muchof his time daydreaming, fantasizing about being an important person someday.Oswald appears to have been drawn at an early age to the epic and intenseideological struggle between communism and democratic capitalism. He claimed hisfirst contact with communist ideology came with a pamphlet handed to him on aNew York street corner. In a Moscow interview shortly after arriving in Russia,Oswald told newspaper reporter Aline Mosby, “I’m a Marxist. . . . I becameinterested about the age of 15. From an ideological viewpoint. An old ladyhanded me a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs. . . . I looked at that paperand I still remember it for some reason, I don’t know why.”Julius and Ethel Rosenberg had been convicted of passing atomic bomb secrets tothe Russians in a celebrated—and still controversial—case beginning in 1950,when Oswald was only twelve. They were executed on June 19, 1953.However, this story of early interest in communism must be taken with a largegrain of salt. After all, this is simply what Oswald told a reporter at a timehe was trying hard to prove he was a devout communist supporter so he would beaccepted into Russia.But this one obscure statement to one reporter on one occasion was turned into arealistic scene cemented in the public’s mind by celebrated author Don Delilloin his 1988 book Libra, a top contender for the National Book Award. Itillustrates how an unsubstantiated fact can be impressed on the public, muchlike the many depictions of an Oswald character perched in the sixth-floorwindow with a rifle.His brother Robert also expressed puzzlement over this story, writing:If Lee was deeply interested in Marxism in the summer of 1955, he said nothingabout it to me. During my brief visit with him in New Orleans, I never saw anybooks on the subject in the apartment on Exchange Place. Never, in my presence,did he read anything that I recognized as communist literature. I was totallysurprised when the information about his interest in Marxism came out, at thetime of his defection to Russia.In New Orleans, Oswald’s study of communism intensified, according to the WarrenCommission. Strangely enough, at the same time he made a patriotic move—joiningthe Civil Air Patrol (CAP).Marguerite Oswald told this author about another fascinating incident. She saidone day after junior high school, Lee arrived home in the company of a militaryofficer who said Lee was a self-starter, an independent sort but bright—just thesort of young man the military was looking for. Could Oswald’s recruitment intomilitary intelligence—or at least his becoming a person of interest to them—havebegun that early in his life?But it was in New Orleans that young Oswald made one of the most intriguingconnections of his life. And it may have been in the Civil Air Patrol that hispro-communism posturing was truly born.Oswald’s Library Card [Contents.html#rsec19]It has been established that Oswald’s CAP leader was a mysterious characternamed David W. Ferrie. Ferrie, an airline pilot, private investigator, andoutspoken right-winger, went on to have connections with reputed Mafia bossCarlos Marcello, anti-Castro Cuban groups, former FBI agent Guy Banister and hisanti-Castro activities, and the CIA. For years, supporters of the lone-assassintheory argued fervently against any connection between Ferrie and Oswald despitethe fact that the House Select Committee on Assassinations interviewed theformer recruit instructor for Oswald’s Lakefront CAP unit, Jerry Paradis, whotold them, “Oswald and Ferrie were in the unit together. I know they were therebecause I was there. . . . I’m not saying that they may have been together. I’msaying it is a certainty.”This argument abruptly ended when a PBS documentary broadcast a photograph ofthe pair together at a CAP function. Ferrie will be discussed at length in othersections of this book.Could Ferrie, who reportedly used his CAP position to establish homosexualcontacts with young boys, have influenced the fifteen-year-old Oswald to beginmaking a procommunist “cover” for himself with an eye toward becoming a USagent?Did Ferrie seek to take advantage of the impressionable young Oswald withstories of using his intelligence contacts to help Oswald enter the excitingworld of espionage? Considering Ferrie’s known homosexuality and intelligenceconnections, this speculation is not far-fetched.We may never know, however, since in 1967 Ferrie was found dead in his NewOrleans apartment the day after being released from protective custody byDistrict Attorney Jim Garrison, who named Ferrie as his chief suspect in a plotto assassinate President Kennedy and described him as “one of history’s mostimportant individuals.”One particularly puzzling incident involved David Ferrie’s library card, whichprovided tantalizing evidence that the connection between the two continued upto the assassination.Within hours of Kennedy’s assassination, an employee of former FBI agent GuyBanister contacted New Orleans authorities and said both Banister and Ferrie hadbeen in touch with Oswald. Oswald used the same address—554 Camp Street—asBanister’s office on some of his Fair Play for Cuba material. Banister also wasa supporter of right-wing causes and had been assisting anti-Castro Cubansthrough his New Orleans private detective agency.Authorities could not immediately locate Ferrie. Sometime later, Ferrie told NewOrleans police he had driven to Texas the night of the assassination to go goosehunting. However, subsequent investigation of Ferrie’s companions revealed thatthey had decided not to hunt geese but, instead, had gone to a Houston skatingrink where Ferrie spent two hours at a pay telephone making and receiving calls.One of Ferrie’s friends told New Orleans police that shortly after Kennedy’sassassination, an attorney named C. Wray Gill had come to Ferrie’s home andmentioned that when Oswald was arrested in Dallas, he was carrying a librarycard with Ferrie’s name on it.Gill, an attorney for Carlos Marcello, promised to act on Ferrie’s behalf uponhis return to New Orleans. On the evening of the Sunday that Jack Ruby killedOswald, Ferrie contacted Gill, who then accompanied Ferrie to the authoritiesthe next day. Ferrie denied knowing anything about Oswald or the assassinationand was released.However, one of Oswald’s former neighbors in New Orleans, Doris Eames, andFerrie’s former building manager, Mrs. Jesse Garner, later recalled Ferrievisiting them both after the assassination asking about a library card. AndOswald’s former landlady said Ferrie came to her asking about the library cardjust hours after the assassination and before the bizarre Texas trip. After allthe furor over the library card, there is nothing in the official recordindicating such a card was ever found in Oswald’s possession. Yet when theyquestioned Ferrie, the Secret Service reportedly asked if he had loaned hislibrary card to Oswald.Could such a library card have disappeared from Oswald’s belongings while inDallas police custody? It certainly would not be the only such incident—anincriminating photograph of Oswald was discovered after nearly fifteen yearsamong the possessions of a retired Dallas policeman. And if such a card existed,it would have been strong evidence that a relationship between Oswald and Ferriecontinued long after young Oswald moved away from New Orleans.[images/line.jpg]In the fall of 1955, Oswald began the tenth grade at Warren Easton High Schoolin New Orleans but dropped out soon after his birthday in October. He had hismother sign a false affidavit stating he was seventeen and he tried to join theMarine Corps. Undoubtedly he was looking forward to Marine training in SanDiego. His brother Robert, who had joined the Marines three years earlier, hadgiven Lee his training manual. His mother later recalled, “He knew it by heart.”His desire to join the Marines was decidedly odd if we are supposed to believe,as the Warren Commission did, that he was a full-blown Marxist by this time. Itmakes more sense to believe that Oswald eagerly looked forward to serving in themilitary because he already knew that plans were being made for his service inintelligence. But his hopes were dashed when the recruiting authorities failedto believe the affidavit. Oswald had to wait another year for his chance at theMarines. His mother noted, “Lee lived for the time that he would becomeseventeen years old to join the Marines—that whole year.” Yet, during that time,he continued to build an identity as a communist sympathizer.During a meeting of the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy Association, he beganexpounding on the virtues of communism, saying communism was the only way oflife for the workers and that he was looking for a communist cell to join butcouldn’t find one. Another time, he was kicked out of the home of a friend afterthe friend’s father overheard him praising the communist system.Some have interpreted this penchant for communism as sincere and as evidence ofhow deeply disturbed Oswald had become. However, when viewed from another side,there is the real possibility that—believing the promises of Captain Ferrie thatthe adventuresome world of spies lay ahead of him and visualizing himself asanother Herbert Philbrick—Oswald was already concocting a procommunist cover.After all, to catch a communist, you had to play like one.Up until his meeting with Ferrie his interest in politics and ideology had beenno different from that of any other bright kid. And his family had a traditionof honorable military service. The questions over Oswald’s regard for communismintensified after he entered the Marine Corps.Semper Fidelis [Contents.html#rsec20]Six days after his seventeenth birthday, Oswald was sworn into the US Marines,whose motto is Semper Fidelis, Latin for “always faithful.”On October 26, 1956, Oswald arrived at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in SanDiego, California. Here he completed basic training with no apparent problems,although his marksmanship on the rifle range was less than what was desired byhis fellow Marines. He failed to qualify on his first test.Former Marine Sherman Cooley recalled that Oswald was given the name “Shitbird”because on his first test he couldn’t qualify on the M-1 rifle. Cooley said, “Itwas a disgrace not to qualify and we gave him holy hell.” More than fiftyMarines who served with Oswald were interviewed by author Henry Hurt in theearly 1980s and all said Oswald’s proficiency with a rifle was laughable. In alater interview, Cooley was even more explicit: “If I had to pick one man in thewhole United States to shoot me, I’d pick Oswald. I saw the man shoot. There’sno way he could have ever learned to shoot well enough to do what they accusedhim of doing in Dallas.”Another Marine buddy, Nelson Delgado, also has publicly spoken of Oswald’sineptness with a rifle. After the assassination, Delgado told investigators thatduring his initial Marine training, Oswald was often “gigged” for having a dirtyrifle and that when the unit went to the rifle range, Oswald got “Maggie’sdrawers”—a red flag signifying that he hadn’t even hit the target, much less thebull’s eye.However, when Delgado tried to tell this to the FBI after the assassination, heclaimed, “They attacked my competence to judge his character and shootingability and criticized my efforts to teach him Spanish.” Hounded and fearful,Delgado finally moved his family to England because “the conspirators may thinkI know more than I do.”In a second round of testing, Oswald managed to qualify as a “sharpshooter” byonly two points in December. Sharpshooter is the second of three grades ofmarksmanship. He did not do nearly so well when he tested a third time for therecord shortly before leaving the Marines. Then, he barely made “marksman,” thelowest grade.On January 20, 1957, he completed basic training and went on to Camp Pendleton,California, where he completed advanced infantry training. While learning combatskills, Oswald reportedly continued to speak favorably of communism—an oddcircumstance for the Marines in the 1950s unless he was still trying toestablish a procommunist cover. Odder still is that at no time did any ofOswald’s Marine superiors note for the record his displays of procommunistsentiment.During this time, despite his procommunist provocations, Oswald apparently wasliked well enough by his fellow Marines, who called him “Ozzie Rabbit” after aTV cartoon character “Oswald the Rabbit.”In March 1957, Oswald reported to the Naval Air Technical Training Center inJacksonville, Florida, although other evidence indicated an Oswald remained atCamp Pendleton until May. The Oswald in Florida studied to be a radar aircontroller, a job given only to men with higher-than-average intelligence. Thisjob also required a security clearance of “Confidential,” which Oswald obtainedat the time he was promoted to private first class.Daniel Patrick Powers, who was with the Oswald in Jacksonville, recalled thatOswald used almost all his weekend passes to go to New Orleans, presumably tovisit his mother. However, Mrs. Oswald was in Texas at the time and relatives inNew Orleans could recall only one phone call from Oswald.Could he have been gaining more advice from Captain Ferrie or someone else onhow to concoct a procommunist cover in preparation for becoming a spy?According to military records, Oswald graduated May 3 and was sent to KeeslerAir Force Base in Mississippi, where he completed an Aircraft Control andWarning Operator Course.After finishing seventh in a class of fifty, Oswald was given a MilitaryOccupational Specialty (MOS) of Aviation Electronics Operator and, after a briefleave, was sent to the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, California. Hestayed there until shipped to Japan aboard the USS Bexar on August 22. Shipmatesnoticed that Oswald read Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, and other “good typeof literature.”Oswald Overseas [Contents.html#rsec21]Upon arriving in Japan, the young Marine was sent about twenty-five milessouthwest of Tokyo to the air base at Atsugi, home of the First Marine AircraftWing—and one of two bases where the then top-secret U-2 spy plane flights wereoriginating. Also at Atsugi was an innocuous group of buildings housing what wasknown only as the “Joint Technical Advisory Group.” In reality, this was the CIAmain operational base in the Far East and speculation has arisen that this waswhere the young Oswald entered the real world of spying.During his duty hours, Oswald sat in a hot, crowded, semicircular radar controlroom known as the “bubble” and intently watched his radarscope for signs ofRussian or Chinese aircraft crossing into Allied airspace. The job’s monotonywas broken only by an occasional unidentified aircraft and the strange planecode-named “Race Car.”The radar operators would overhear Race Car asking for wind information at90,000 feet. They at first thought this was some sort of joke, since the worldaltitude record at that time was only slightly more than 65,000 and the radarheight-finding antenna read only up to 45,000.However, slowly the men of Oswald’s unit, Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1,realized that they were overhearing conversations from the strange-lookingaircraft that they would see wheeled out of a large nearby hangar and screaminto the air. When asked about the craft, the officers would say only that itwas a “utility plane.” The men didn’t know this utility plane, or U-2, was beingused to penetrate Soviet and Chinese airspace to photograph military andindustrial targets.Oswald seemed to show particular interest in Race Car and other “secrets” ofAtsugi. One Marine recalled seeing Oswald taking photographs of the base and heshowed special interest during unit briefings on classified material.Just as he had gone off alone to New Orleans, Oswald began making two-day visitsto Tokyo. Years later, Oswald reportedly confided that he made contact with asmall group of Japanese communists in Tokyo while in the Marines. Even WarrenCommission lawyers W. David Slawson and William T. Coleman Jr. stated in areport that was classified for a time, “There is the possibility that Oswaldcame into contact with communist agents at that time.”Oswald told a friend at the time that he was having an affair with a Japanesegirl who worked as a hostess in a Tokyo nightclub called the Queen Bee.This was an intriguing connection indeed, for the Queen Bee was one of the threemost expensive nightspots in Tokyo. An evening at the Queen Bee could cost up to$100. It catered especially to officers and pilots—including U-2 pilots,according to author Edward Jay Epstein. It was believed that the hostesses ofthe Queen Bee, one hundred of the most beautiful women in Tokyo, were usingtheir charms to gain information from American servicemen.It was a decidedly odd meeting place for Oswald, who was making less than $85 amonth, with much of that being sent back to help support his mother.Was the poor Marine private Oswald being used to gather intelligence or wasOswald testing his intelligence abilities to infiltrate communist agents in theQueen Bee? The answer to this question may have come when author/researcher MarkLane interviewed one of Oswald’s former Marine pals from Atsugi.David Bucknell, who was never interviewed by the Warren Commission, told of anincident in which he and Oswald went for beers at a bar near Santa Ana,California, where they were both stationed in 1959. While sitting there, the twoMarines were approached by two women who engaged them in conversation. Accordingto Bucknell, later that day Oswald said this incident reminded him of a similarexperience at Atsugi. According to Oswald’s story, he was sitting alone in aJapanese bar when an attractive woman joined him and began asking questionsregarding his work at Atsugi. Since his work involved the highly secret U-2plane, Oswald reported this meeting to his superior officer. Soon this officerarranged a meeting between Oswald and a man in civilian clothes. Oswald toldBucknell the man explained that Oswald could do his country a great service bygiving false information to the woman, a known KGB agent. Oswald agreed and thusbecame an intelligence operative. Oswald said he had been encouraged to continuemeeting the woman and was given money to spend at the Queen Bee.While no US intelligence agency has admitted it, there is further evidence tosuggest that he was indeed used as an agent. Sergeant Gerry Patrick Hemming, whoserved in Japan with Oswald and later joined anti-Castro Cubans, said he wasrecruited into the CIA while in Japan and, while Oswald never said so, based onconversations between the two, he believed the same thing happened to Oswald.A former CIA finance officer, James Wilcott, testified to the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations that colleagues told him that Oswald was a secretoperative for the spy agency in Japan. Wilcott, who served in the CIA from 1957through 1966, said after Kennedy’s assassination he had several conversationswith CIA personnel involved in covert operations. He said, based on theseconversations and his experience of paying CIA funds to secret operationsthrough the use of code names, or “cryptos,” he became convinced that Oswald wasbrought into the CIA while serving as a radar operator in Japan and later wassent to infiltrate Russia as a spy.When CIA officials denied these charges—one went so far as to suggest thatOswald was actually recruited by the Soviet KGB while in Japan—the committeedecided not to believe Wilcott.Another tantalizing piece of evidence that Oswald was involved in intelligencework while stationed in Japan comes from his Marine Corps medical records. Thoserecords show that on September 16, 1958, Oswald was treated for “urethritis,acute, due to gonococcus.” Gonorrhea is a venereal disease condemned loudly bythe military. For servicemen, a case of gonorrhea often results in disciplinarymeasures. However, Oswald’s medical record states, “Origin: In line of duty, notdue to own misconduct.” The fact that Oswald was absolved of any responsibilityin contracting gonorrhea astounds service veterans and is strong evidence thathis extracurricular activities had the blessings of the military, if not of theCIA.Another small but eye-opening revelation came from secret meetings of the WarrenCommission. General counsel J. Lee Rankin—armed with initial reports from themilitary—told Commission members two months after the assassination, “We aretrying to run that down, to find out what he studied at the Monterey School ofthe Army in the way of languages.” The Monterey School, now called the DefenseLanguage Institute, is one of the government schools for giving sophisticatedand rapid language courses. Rankin’s remark, made public only after a Freedom ofInformation Act suit, seems to imply that the Commission had knowledge ofOswald’s attending courses at Monterey.And it is certainly easier to believe that Oswald got a crash course in theRussian language in the military than to believe that this high-school dropoutlearned one of the world’s most difficult languages by reading books andlistening to records, as implied by the Warren Commission. Fellow Marinestestified they could not recall Oswald listening to any language records.It is possible that undercover work was behind a strange shooting incident thattook place just as his unit was scheduled to be transferred to the Philippinesin late 1957. On October 27, Oswald was gathering gear from his locker whenreportedly a .22-caliber derringer fell onto the floor and discharged, grazinghis left elbow. As nearby Marines rushed into his room, all Oswald would saywas, “I believe I shot myself.”Before the incident, Oswald had told a friend, George Wilkins, that he hadbought the derringer from a mail-order firm in the United States. At least twoof the Marines present, Thomas Bagshaw and Pete Connor, now claim the bulletmissed Oswald altogether. Others at the time had the impression that Oswald shothimself in an attempt to prevent being transferred to the Philippines. If thatwas the case, it failed. Although absent almost three weeks for medicaltreatment, he was returned to duty just in time to ship out with his unit onNovember 20.The maneuvers of Oswald’s unit in the Philippines and South China Sea werelargely uneventful. While the unit was on Corregidor Island, actor John Waynestopped in briefly and a photograph was taken of him. In a background doorwaystands Marine Oswald, who was serving his third straight month on mess duty.His lengthy hospital stay following the derringer incident and the amount oftime he spent pulling KP (kitchen police) may indicate time away from hisregular unit spent in intelligence training. According to witnesses, his elbowwound was very minor, yet Oswald spent nearly three weeks in a hospital. Moretime gaps in his military career were to come.Back at Atsugi, Oswald was court-martialed for possessing an unregisteredweapon—the derringer. On April 11, 1958, he was found guilty and sentenced totwenty days at hard labor, forfeiture of $50 in pay, and reduced back to therank of private. His confinement was suspended for six months on the conditionthat he stay out of trouble.It was about this time that Oswald put in for a hardship discharge. As thisapplication was being processed, there apparently was a need for more time awayfrom his unit for additional intelligence training. This may have beenaccomplished by an incident that began in the Enlisted Men’s Club at Atsugi.Oswald, who heretofore had not been known as violent, tried to pick a fight withTechnical Sergeant Miguel Rodriguez, allegedly the man who had assigned him toso much KP duty. Rodriguez failed to rise to the bait.On June 20, Oswald sought out Rodriguez at the Bluebird Club in Yamato and againtried to fight with the sergeant. After Oswald poured a drink on Rodriguez,military police intervened, and the next day, Rodriguez signed a complaintagainst Oswald. At the court-martial, Oswald acted as his own defense, claiminghe was drunk and spilled the drink on Rodriguez accidentally. Rodriguez saidthen—and after the assassination—that Oswald had not been drunk and had pouredthe drink on him deliberately.The judge ruled that Oswald was guilty of using “provoking words” to anoncommissioned officer and sentenced him to twenty-eight days in the brig andforfeiture of $55. Furthermore, his previous suspension of sentence was revokedand Oswald supposedly went to the brig until August 13, a period of more thanforty-five days. Only one Marine who was in the Atsugi brig during this timerecalled seeing Oswald and he said during this brief encounter Oswald waswearing civilian clothes.After his release, several Marines commented that Oswald seemed different.Joseph D. Macedo said he found him “a completely changed person.” Others saidthat where “Ozzie Rabbit” had been extroverted and fun-filled, this new Oswaldwas cold and withdrawn. It may well be right here that a new Oswald—an entirelydifferent man—was substituted for the New Orleans–born Marine. See the section“Was Oswald Really Oswald?”Meanwhile, a previously granted extension of overseas duty was canceled and itappeared that Oswald would soon be on his way home. However, in September 1958,the Chinese communists began making moves against the Nationalist Chineseislands of Quemoy and Matsu and there was a general mobilization. Oswaldaccompanied his unit to Formosa (now Taiwan). Not long after their arrival onthe island, Oswald was assigned guard duty. About midnight, the officer of theguard, Lieutenant Charles R. Rhodes, heard several shots. Running to the scene,Rhodes found Oswald slumped against a tree holding his M-l rifle in his lap.Rhodes recalled, “When I got to him, he was shaking and crying. He said he hadseen men in the woods and that he challenged them and then started shooting. . .. He kept saying he couldn’t bear being on guard duty.”Almost immediately, Oswald was shipped back to Atsugi, arriving on October 5,1958, according to official reports. Years later, Rhodes said he still believedthat Oswald planned the shooting incident as a ploy to get himself transferredback to Japan. Rhodes never received any explanation for the willingness of theMarine Corps to go along with this “ploy” except that Oswald was being returnedfor “medical treatment.”Recall the medical records concerning Oswald’s gonorrhea contracted “in line ofduty.” However, this record is dated September 16, 1958, two days after Oswaldofficially left with his unit for Formosa.This, as well as several other discrepancies in Oswald’s military servicerecords, has caused some assassination researchers to believe that more than oneman was using the name Oswald during this time. Perhaps more time was needed toprepare Oswald for upcoming intelligence missions.Back at Atsugi and with his unit gone, Oswald was temporarily assigned to aMarine squadron at Iwakuni, an air base about 430 miles southwest of Tokyo.Here, quite by accident, he came into contact with Owen Dejanovich, a Marine whohad attended radar school with him. Dejanovich tried to renew theacquaintanceship but was rebuffed by Oswald, who avoided the one man who hadknown him previously. Dejanovich also found Oswald changed. He said Oswald keptreferring to the Marines as “you Americans” and raving about “Americanimperialism” and “exploitation.” He also noticed that Oswald was keeping companywith locals again, this time with a “round-eyed Russian girlfriend.”Oswaldskovich the Marine [Contents.html#rsec22]On November 2, 1958, Oswald boarded the USS Barrett for the two-week trip to SanFrancisco. On November 19, he took a thirty-day leave, traveling by bus to FortWorth, where he stayed with his mother, but he spent most of his time huntingsquirrels and rabbits.On December 22, he was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No. 9 at El Toro,California. Here he was one of seven enlisted men and three officers who formeda radar crew. According to the Warren Report, “This work probably gave himaccess to certain kinds of classified material, some of which, such as aircraftcall signs and radio frequencies, was changed after his [attempted] defection toRussia.”It was here that Oswald’s public embracing of communism reached new heights. Hewould answer questions with da or nyet and address fellow Marines as “Comrade.”When playing chess, he always wanted the red pieces, which he referred to as the“victorious Red Army.” His Marine companions began calling him “Oswaldskovich.”One of his fellow Marines, Kerry Thornley, was so impressed by this “eightball”that he later wrote a novel using a character based on Oswald. He noted:What causes me to have second thoughts about his commitment to communism is hisenthusiasm for a book unpopular with the few self-admitted communists I haveknown, for obvious reasons. The book is George Orwell’s 1984, a severe criticismin fiction form of socialist totalitarianism. . . . I read 1984 and for a whiledecided Oswald was not truly in sympathy with Marxism. It had to be a joke, Iconcluded.Marine Nelson Delgado also got along well with Oswald. Delgado, a Puerto Rican,said Oswald “treated him like an equal.” Oswald and Delgado talked at lengthabout Cuba and Fidel Castro’s coming to power. After a while, Oswald beganasking Delgado how he could get in touch with some Cubans.Delgado said one day he handed Oswald a note saying he should write the Cubanembassy in Washington, DC. Not long after that, Delgado noticed that Oswald, whopreviously received few letters, began receiving mail several times a week andthat at least some of this mail came from the Cuban consulate.If Oswald was a genuine Marine communist, it beggars the imagination to thinkthat his officers took no notice. In fact, Thornley told of an incident in whicha young lieutenant did notice that Oswald was receiving a Russian newspaper inthe mail. According to this story:The lieutenant grew very excited over his discovery and possibly made an openissue of Oswald’s probable sympathy to the communist cause. Most of the troops .. . were very much amused at the lieutenant’s having “pushed the panic button.”Oswald, of course, didn’t think it was so funny. But apparently the lieutenant’swarnings were ignored by the command.Were these warnings ignored or were higher-ups more knowledgeable about Oswald’sactivities?Another hint as to Oswald’s true allegiances may be found in an odd incidentinvolving his friend Thornley, with whom Oswald spent many hours in ideologicaland philosophical discussions.Thornley told the Warren Commission that one day while he and Oswald werepreparing for a military parade and were remarking about the stupidity of thething, Oswald said it made him angry. Thornley then said:“Well, come the revolution you will change all that” . . . at which time[Oswald] looked at me like a betrayed Caesar and screamed, “Not you, too,Thornley!” And I remember his voice cracked as he said this. He was definitelydisturbed at what I had said and I didn’t really think I had said that much. . .. I never said anything to him again and he never said anything to me again.This sounds more like a person deeply hurt that a good friend would seriouslybelieve him to be a communist than like a communist sympathizer angered over aninnocuous jibe.James Botelho, today a California judge, was a roommate of Oswald’s during hisstay at El Toro. Botelho even once took Oswald home to meet his parents. He hasnever bought the idea that Oswald turned communist. In an interview withauthor/researcher Mark Lane, Botelho stated, “I’m very conservative now and Iwas at least as conservative at that time. Oswald was not a communist or aMarxist. If he was I would have taken violent action against him and so wouldmany of the other Marines in the unit.”Whatever his true beliefs about communism, Oswald at this time knew biggerthings were looming on his horizon.In the spring of 1959, he had applied to study philosophy at the AlbertSchweitzer College in Switzerland and had been accepted. In a cryptic letter tohis brother, he wrote, “Pretty soon I’ll be getting out of the Corps and I knowwhat I want to be and how I’m going to be it.”Years later, Marine Bucknell told Mark Lane that during 1959 he, Oswald, andother Marines at the El Toro base were ordered to report to the militaryCriminal Investigation Division (CID). There a civilian tried to recruit thosepresent for an intelligence operation against “communists” in Cuba.Oswald was selected to make several more trips to CID and later told Bucknellthat the civilian was the same man who had been his intelligence contact atAtsugi. Sometime later, Oswald confided to Bucknell that he was to be dischargedfrom the Marines and go to Russia. Oswald said he was being sent there byAmerican intelligence and that he would return to America in 1961 as a hero.Judge Botelho, Oswald’s former roommate, told of his reaction to Oswald’s tripto Russia:Well, when Oswald’s presence in the Soviet Union was made public, it was thetalk of everyone who knew him at the base. First of all, I was aware of the factthat the radio codes and other codes were not changed and that Oswald knew allof them. That made me suspicious. I knew Oswald was not a communist and was, infact, anti-Soviet. Then, when no real investigation about Oswald occurred at thebase, I was sure that Oswald was on an intelligence assignment in Russia. . . .Two civilians dropped in [at El Toro], asked a few questions, took no writtenstatements, and recorded no interviews with witnesses. It was the most casual ofinvestigations. It was a cover-investigation so that it could be said that therehad been an investigation. . . . Oswald, it was said, was the only Marine everto defect from his country to another country, a communist country, duringpeacetime. That was a major event. When the Marine Corps and Americanintelligence decided not to probe the reasons for the “defection,” I knew thenwhat I know now: Oswald was on an assignment in Russia for Americanintelligence.[images/line.jpg]Plans for a trip to Russia apparently had been made for Oswald and the Marines,a branch of the US Navy Department, seemed oddly obliging.On August 17, 1959, Oswald applied for a dependency discharge on the groundsthat his mother needed his support. This application was accompanied byaffidavits from his mother, an attorney, a doctor, and two friends—all suppliedby his mother—stating she had been injured at work in December 1958 and wasunable to support herself. Later investigation showed a candy box had fallen onher nose and that she had not even bothered to see a doctor until well after theincident. Nevertheless, within two weeks, to the surprise of his fellow Marines,Oswald’s request was approved and he was released from service on September 11.On September 4, Oswald applied for a passport, plainly stating that he mighttravel to various countries including Russia and Cuba. This, of course, was inopposition to his claim that he was going home to care for his injured mother.His passport was “routinely” issued six days later, just in time for his exitfrom the Marines.After a brief stopover in Texas with his mother, Oswald withdrew $203 from hisonly known bank account and continued on to New Orleans, where he purchased aticket for Le Havre, France, on the freighter Marion Lykes for $220.75.He had told his mother he was going to New Orleans to work for an import-exportfirm, but in a letter mailed just before he sailed, he wrote:I have booked passage on a ship to Europe. I would have had to sooner or laterand I think its best I go now. Just remember above all else that my values aredifferent from Robert’s or yours. It is difficult to tell you how I feel. Justremember, this is what I must do. I did not tell you about my plans because youcould hardly be expected to understand.Until the day she died, Oswald’s mother maintained her son was an agent of theUS government.On September 20, 1959, Oswald left on the first leg of a journey that would takehim to his destiny—via Russia."},{"pageContent":"Russians [Contents.html#rch4]In the summer of 1959, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the UnitedStates. Both Khrushchev and his Western counterpart, US president DwightEisenhower, seemed sincere in wanting to ease the tensions between their twocountries.A summit meeting was scheduled for mid-May 1960. It might have produced alimited nuclear-test-ban treaty, already foreseen as the first major accord ofthe Cold War.But it was not to be. On May 1, traditionally celebrated in Russia as May Day,CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers was captured alive after his U-2 spy plane crashedin the Soviet Union following an explosion.Khrushchev was furious, yet he tried to give Eisenhower latitude in disclaimingany knowledge of the incident. He stated that the U-2 flight may have been thework of “American aggressive circles” trying to “torpedo the Paris summit, or,at any rate, prevent an agreement for which the whole world is waiting.”After days of half-truths and evasions, Eisenhower finally admitted that the spyplane was acting on his orders and took responsibility for the fiasco, just asJohn Kennedy would take responsibility for the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion ayear later. It has been reported that Eisenhower actually had ordered the U-2overflights halted but this order was thwarted within his own command structure.And questions still surround the U-2 incident, especially with students ofhistory. For example, in The People’s Almanac David Wallechinsky and IrvingWallace note, “It is possible that certain US military leaders deployed Powerspurposely to sabotage the peace talks which Eisenhower himself acutely desired.”Oswald and the U-2 [Contents.html#rsec23]Francis Gary Powers and his ill-fated U-2 spy plane were brought down six monthsafter a former Marine named Lee Harvey Oswald arrived in Moscow and told anAmerican embassy official he planned to give the Soviets classified informationhe had gained as a radar operator in the Marine Corps.Richard E. Snyder, a CIA intelligence operative serving as senior consularofficer at the Moscow embassy, recalled that Oswald went so far as to state thathe knew something that would be of “special interest” to Soviet intelligence.What “special interest” information did Oswald have? The Russians had knownabout the U-2 program for some time and their antiaircraft missiles were capableof shooting down the high-flying craft. What the Soviets lacked was detailedaltitude information on the U-2 that would have allowed them to accuratelycontrol their missiles at great altitudes. Oswald, who served as a radaroperator at Atsugi, Japan, one of the staging bases for the U-2 flights, hadthat information.After being swapped for a Soviet spy, Powers returned to the United States andwrote a book about his ordeal titled Operation Overflight. He pointed outOswald’s claim that he had information for the Soviets and implied that ifindeed Oswald gave information pertaining to U-2 operational altitudes and radartechniques used during its flight, the Russians may have learned enough toenable them to shoot down the U-2. Powers also said his Soviet interrogatorsseemed to have special knowledge about the Atsugi base, although Powersmaintained he had never been stationed there.For years the Warren Commission withheld from the American public filesdetailing Oswald’s connection with the U-2 flights.Some people familiar with the U-2 incident believe the plane may have beendowned due to sabotage. In 1977, Powers was killed when his helicopter, used toreport news for a Los Angeles television station, ran out of gas and crashed.His death was ironic in that fuel consumption was of critical importance to U-2pilots.There are two tantalizing clues that Oswald may have indeed had some connectionwith the U-2 incident. In a letter to his brother, Oswald wrote regardingPowers, “He seemed to be a nice bright American-type fellow when I saw him inMoscow.” There is no explanation of how or when Oswald might have seen Powers,particularly since officially Oswald never returned to Moscow after being sentto Minsk in 1960.After his return to the United States, Oswald told former Army security employeeDennis Ofstein, a fellow worker at Jaggers-Childs-Stovall, the Dallas graphicarts firm with government contracts where Oswald worked in the fall of 1962,that he had viewed Russian jets in Moscow on May Day. Of Oswald’s three May Daysspent in Russia, the only one unaccounted for is May 1, 1960—the day the U-2 wascaptured.[images/line.jpg]Because of the U-2 flights during this time, Soviet intelligence was extremelyinterested in American defectors, because of both the knowledge they might haveand the suspicion that most, if not all, were spies trying to infiltrate thecountry.Apparently American intelligence was equally curious to learn about the Soviets.According to author Anthony Summers, who studied documents from both the StateDepartment and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, only two USenlisted men defected to Russia between 1945 and 1959. Yet in the eighteenmonths prior to January 1960, no fewer than nine defected, five of them US Armymen from West Germany and two Navy men.All these defectors, including at least three civilians, had backgrounds in themilitary or in sensitive defense work. It is known that, like Oswald, at leastfour of these returned to the United States after a few years.Robert E. Webster—Another Oswald? [Contents.html#rsec24]The case of Robert E. Webster, an American who told officials he was defectingto Russia less than two weeks before Oswald, is worth considering since thereappear to be similarities between the two.Webster, a former Navy man, was a young plastics expert who simply failed toreturn home with colleagues after working at an American trade exhibition inMoscow. He had been an employee of the Rand Development Corporation, one of thefirst US companies to sell technical products to Russia.Although Rand Development was thought to be separate from the more notoriousRand Corporation—the CIA think-tank front where Daniel Ellsberg copied thePentagon Papers—there is some evidence of connections between the two. The firmswere at one time located across the street from each other in New York City;Rand Development held several CIA contracts; and several top officials of RandDevelopment—president Henry Rand, George Bookbinder, and Christopher Bird—werelater connected with the CIA.While in Russia, Webster took a Soviet girl as common-law wife (he was alreadymarried to a woman in the United States) and the couple had a child.Like Oswald, Webster claimed to have become disenchanted with Soviet life and hereturned to the United States about the same time as Oswald. But now the storyturns even stranger. Although Webster is said to have told American officials henever had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, when Oswald was arranging hisreturn to the United States in 1961, he “asked [US Embassy officials] about thefate of a young man named Webster who had come to the Soviet Union shortlybefore he did.”And there are some intriguing connections between Webster and Oswald’s wife,Marina. Years later in America, Marina told an acquaintance that her husband haddefected after working at an American exhibition in Moscow. This, of course,reflects Webster’s story, not Oswald’s. After the assassination, when Americanintelligence was looking into Marina’s background, they discovered an address inher address book was that of Webster’s Leningrad apartment.Were Webster and Oswald two of several fake defectors being sent into Russiaduring 1958 and 1959? The parallels of their stories are striking. AuthorSummers talked with former CIA officer Victor Marchetti, who analyzed Sovietmilitary activities during the time Oswald went to Russia, and was told:At the time, in 1959, the United States was having real difficulty in acquiringinformation out of the Soviet Union; the technical systems had, of course, notdeveloped to the point that they are at today, and we were resorting to allsorts of activities. One of these activities was an ONI [Office of NavalIntelligence] program which involved three dozen, maybe forty, young men whowere made to appear disenchanted, poor, American youths who had become turnedoff and wanted to see what communism was all about. They were sent into theSoviet Union or into Eastern Europe, with the specific intention the Sovietswould pick them up and “double” them if they suspected them of being US agents,or recruit them as KGB agents. They were trained at various naval installationsboth here and abroad, but the operation was being run out of Nag’s Head, NorthCarolina.This is particularly interesting because this Navy program sounds exactly likeOswald’s experience.While Oswald was in Russia, the State Department was engaged in studying USdefectors to Russia. Otto Otepka, the official in charge of the study, said oneof its goals was to determine which defectors were genuine and which may havebeen US intelligence operatives.In June 1963, five months prior to the Kennedy assassination, Otepka said he wasousted from his job and, in fact, barred from access to his study material ondefectors, one of whom was Lee Harvey Oswald.Asked by a researcher in 1971 whether Oswald was a real or fake defector, Otepkareplied, “We had not made up our minds when . . . we were thrown out of theoffice.”This incident is especially troubling, for if the shutdown of the StateDepartment investigation was because of Oswald, this is strong evidence thatsomeone within the US government had prior knowledge of Oswald’s role in theupcoming assassination.A Phony Defection [Contents.html#rsec25]Oswald’s attempted defection to Russia was as fabricated as many other aspectsof his life.The Marion Lykes arrived in Le Havre, France, on October 8, 1959. Oswald arrivedin Southampton, England, October 9 and, according to the Warren Commission, setoff for Helsinki, Finland, arriving and checking into the Torni Hotel that sameday.However, in Oswald’s passport, the British immigration stamp reads, “Embarked 10Oct. 1959.”This presents a real problem, since the only direct flight from London toHelsinki that day did not arrive in time for Oswald to have checked into theTorni Hotel at the hour shown in the hotel’s register.The discrepancy in times has led some researchers to believe that Oswald got toFinland by some means other than public transportation—perhaps in US militaryaircraft. But this possibility, of course, smacks of intelligence work and wasnot officially investigated.Another oddity: Throughout his life, Oswald was tight with money, usuallystaying in cheap rooming houses and apartments. However, once in Helsinki, heregistered in the Torni Hotel, then moved the next day into the Klaus KurkiHotel, two of the city’s most expensive and luxurious lodgings.The Warren Commission claimed Oswald then visited the Soviet consulate inHelsinki and obtained a visa in two days, which must have been some sort ofrecord, as the Commission also determined that the shortest normal time forobtaining a visa was one week.Oswald’s visa was issued October 14 and the Commission said Oswald left by trainthe next day for Moscow, arriving on October 16.However, the leading Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheters reported three days afterthe assassination that Oswald failed to get his Soviet visa inHelsinki—information that since then has been confirmed by Swedish intelligence.The paper said Oswald instead went to Stockholm, where he obtained a visa at theRussian embassy after two days. Curiously, neither the Warren Commission nor theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations mentioned this side trip.Whatever the facts, the speed and ease with which Oswald journeyed to Moscowgives the impression that more was motivating this young man than the simpledesire to experience a communist state.Arriving in Moscow by train, Oswald was taken in tow by a representative ofIntourist, the official state tourist agency, who placed him in the HotelBerlin, where he registered as a student. The next day Oswald went sightseeingwith his Intourist guide, a young woman named Rima Shirokova, and promptlyinformed her he wanted to defect.Despite his proclamation that he was a “communist” wanting to live in Russia,after several contacts with Soviet authorities Oswald was informed on October 21that his visa had expired and he had two hours to leave Moscow. Faced withdeportation, Oswald reportedly cut his left wrist in a suicide attempt.Conveniently, this was done just before a meeting with his Intourist guide. Shefound him in his hotel room and took him to a hospital. This act accomplishedthe same end result of the Marine shooting incident—he was out of sight in thehospital for eleven days.He was released on October 28 and, accompanied by Shirokova, checked out of theHotel Berlin and into the Metropole. The Warren Commission concluded, “Thegovernment undoubtedly directed him to make the change.” Oswald had indeed beenin touch with Soviet government officials from the Pass and Registration Office.He remained in his hotel room three days, apparently awaiting orders fromsomeone. He told Shirokova he was impatient, but didn’t say why.By Saturday, October 31, 1959, Oswald was ready to make his move. Striding pastthe Marine guards at the US embassy, he plopped his passport down in front of areceptionist and declared he had come to “dissolve his American citizenship.”He was directed to Richard E. Snyder, the second secretary and senior consularofficial, who tried to dissuade the young ex-Marine from his planned course ofaction. Oswald handed Snyder an undated, handwritten note that displayed asophisticated knowledge of the legal subtleties concerning the revocation ofcitizenship. It reflected the same type of knowledge that apparently had allowedOswald to make his journey to Moscow in a most unorthodox manner.The note stated:I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my present citizenship in theUnited States of America, be revoked. . . . I take these steps for politicalreasons. My request for the revoking of my American citizenship is made onlyafter the longest and most serious considerations. I affirm that my allegianceis to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Present with Snyder was John McVickar, another senior consular officer. In lateryears, McVickar said he felt Oswaldwas following a pattern of behavior in which he had been tutored by a person orpersons unknown . . . seemed to be using words he had learned but did not fullyunderstand. . . . In short, it seemed to me there was the possibility that hehad been in contact with others before or during his Marine Corps tour who hadguided him and encouraged him in his actions.In later years Snyder himself came under suspicion of aiding Oswald in anintelligence mission when it was revealed that he had worked for theCIA—although the agency claimed it was only for a brief time in 1949.When the House Select Committee on Assassinations looked into the matter,investigators found that Snyder’s CIA file was unavailable “[as] a matter ofcover.” The committee found this revelation “extremely troubling.”According to the Warren Commission, Snyder did not permit Oswald to renounce hiscitizenship. Since it was a Saturday, Snyder explained that Oswald would have toreturn on a normal business day to fill out the necessary paperwork. Oswaldnever returned and, therefore, technically never renounced his citizenship. OnNovember 3, Oswald sent the embassy a letter protesting its refusal to accepthis renunciation of citizenship. However, he never showed up in person to pursuethat act. And when embassy personnel attempted to contact Oswald, he refused tosee them.His widely publicized defection never happened.Could the three-day wait in his hotel room have been because he had been coachednot to defect unless it was on a Saturday? How could a high school dropout knowall of these legalistic subtleties without being briefed by more knowledgeablepersons?Even American newswoman Priscilla Johnson, who interviewed Oswald a few dayslater in his hotel room, thought he “may have purposely not carried through hisoriginal intent to renounce [citizenship] in order to leave a crack open.”During this time, Oswald granted two newspaper interviews, one to Aline Mosby ofUPI and the other to Johnson, who said she represented the North AmericanNewspaper Alliance syndicate. Oswald harangued both reporters with his ferventsupport of Marxism and its ideals and both dutifully reported his comments innewspaper articles that appeared back in the United States.Johnson (now Priscilla Johnson McMillan) would later write the book Marina andLee, which supposedly “reveals the innermost secrets of [Marina’s] life with theman who shot JFK.” McMillan once was an assistant to Senator John F. Kennedy andwent on to become an acknowledged expert on Soviet affairs. It is McMillan whohas been primarily responsible for much of the information concerning Oswald’spersonal life shortly before the assassination.There has been much speculation over the years that McMillan was operating onbehalf of US intelligence when she was in contact with Oswald. She has testifiedthat she never worked for the CIA. However, the House Select Committee onAssassinations reported that she had applied to work for the CIA in 1952, hadbeen “debriefed” by that agency after a trip to Russia in 1962, and in fact hadprovided the CIA with “cultural and literary” information.Suspicion about her increased with the release of an FBI memorandum datedNovember 23, 1963, in which a State Department security officer informed theFBI, “One Priscilla Johnston [sic] and Mrs. G. Stanley Brown also had contactwith Oswald in Russia. Both these women were formerly State Department employeesat the American Embassy and their contact with Oswald was official business.”By December 1959, Oswald had dropped from sight in the Soviet Union and was notheard from again for more than a year. During that time, most of what is knownabout Oswald’s activities comes from his “Historic Diary,” supposedly aday-to-day account of his life in Russia. Life magazine had obtained a copy ofthe so-called diary from Dallas Morning News reporter Hugh Aynesworth. Someaccused Aynesworth of pilfering the document from Oswald’s belongings whileothers thought someone passed it to the reporter to solidify Oswald’sprocommunist background. Aynesworth, who earlier had tried to join the CIA, hasrefused to reveal the diary’s origin. The diary appeared to have been writtenlong after the events described.Even the Warren Commission had trouble with Oswald’s diary, noting, “It is notan accurate guide to the details of Oswald’s activities. Oswald seems not tohave been concerned about the accuracy of dates and names and apparently mademany of his entries subsequent to the date the events occurred.”For instance, Oswald notes in his entry for October 31, 1959—the day he visitedthe American embassy—that John McVickar had taken Richard Snyder’s place as“head consul.” This change did not take place until two years after that date,at a time Oswald was preparing to leave Russia.In later years, experts hired by the House Select Committee on Assassinationsconcluded the “diary” was written entirely on the same paper and was mostprobably written in one or two sittings.This fact further fuels the charge that Oswald, even while in the Soviet Union,was acting on orders from someone else. This charge was even voiced by WarrenCommission general counsel J. Lee Rankin, who told Commission members inexecutive session, “That entire period is just full of possibilities fortraining, for working with the Soviets, and its agents.”Aside from the “diary,” there is precious little documentation about Oswald’sstay in Russia. But in early 1964, the Soviet government did provide the WarrenCommission with fifteen pages of documents, including copies of Oswald’spassport, a job application from a Minsk radio factory, some hospital records,and a supervisor’s report from the factory.Comrade Oswald [Contents.html#rsec26]Although much about Oswald’s life in Russia is unknown, several tantalizingpieces of information tell a decidedly different story of his sojourn there fromthe one previously told.After spending New Year’s Day 1960 in Moscow, Oswald reportedly was then sent toMinsk with 5,000 rubles. The money supposedly came from the Red Cross, althoughOswald himself wrote that the money actually came from the Soviet MVD (theSoviet secret police) after he “denounced” the United States. He reported thathe was greeted in Minsk on January 8 by no less than the mayor of the city, whopromised him a rent-free apartment.And what an apartment it was—a spacious flat with a separate living room, tilefloors, and modern furniture, accommodations far beyond the means of the averageRussian worker. Two private balconies overlooked a picturesque bend in theSvisloch River.It was here that Oswald entertained his newfound Russian friends, such as PavelGolovachev. The son of General P. Y. Golovachev, a “hero of the Soviet Union”and a man who reportedly traveled in Minsk’s highest social circles, Golovachevwas pictured in some of the snapshots Oswald made in his Minsk home.Oswald was assigned duties as a “metal worker” in the Byelorussian Radio andTelevision factory. Here, between his wages and the continuing “Red Cross”allowance, Oswald reportedly was making more money than the factory’s director.Oswald wrote about affairs with at least five local girls, whom he would take tonearby movies, theaters, and opera. As he wrote in his “diary,” he was “livingbig.”On a darker side, it should be noted that Minsk, along with being a somewhatcosmopolitan city by Russian standards, also was the site of an espionagetraining school made known to the CIA as far back as 1947. It provided aconvenient red herring for those hoping to distract from Oswald’s homegrownintelligence connections.In testimony to the Warren Commission on May 14, 1964, FBI director J. EdgarHoover said:Just the day before yesterday information came to me indicating that there is anespionage training school outside of Minsk—I don’t know whether it is true—andthat he [Oswald] was trained at that school to come back to this country tobecome what they call a “sleeper,” that is a man who will remain dormant forthree or four years and in case of international hostilities rise up and beused.Almost adjacent to this spy school is the Foreign Language Institute. In amanuscript about his life in Minsk, Oswald admitted, “I was in the ForeignLanguage Institute.” Perhaps realizing his slip, Oswald edited this remark toread, “I was visiting friends in the Foreign Language Institute.”In addition to his money and lavish apartment, there is other evidence tosuggest that Oswald was living a privileged life with his Soviet hosts. Althoughofficially he never left Minsk and he pointed out how most Soviet citizens wereprohibited from traveling far from their home, Oswald apparently traveledextensively in Russia.Jeanne DeMohrenschildt, who along with her husband, George, befriended Oswaldafter his return to the United States, said he was quite interested inphotography. She said he had photographs of various locations in Russia that heshowed her with great pride. He also told her about his enjoyable weekendshunting. And found among his possessions was a Soviet hunting license showing hehad been a member of the Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, whichcarried with it the privilege of owning a 16-gauge shotgun, another featimpossible for the average Russian.About the only fact that can be stated without question concerning Oswald’s lifein Russia is that he lived well beyond the means of the ordinary Soviet citizen.To most researchers, this abundant life indicates some sort of specialrelationship with Soviet officials. The exact nature of this relationship isstill unknown. However, many assassination students believe two things: one,that Oswald’s fake defection to Russia may have had something to do with thedowning of the U-2 spy plane on May 1, 1960, and second, whatever the purposesof his intelligence mission to Russia, it had nothing to do with the subsequentassassination of President Kennedy except to paint Oswald as a communistoperative and force the Soviets into covering up any connection with the accusedassassin.[images/line.jpg]Although Oswald was not heard from in Russia between December 1959 and February1961, the wheels of the US bureaucracy were turning.As early as November 10, 1959, the FBI, upon learning of Oswald’s attempteddefection, placed a “flash” notice on his fingerprint card. This served to alertbureau officials should Oswald’s fingerprints turn up in any FBI investigation.It also placed his name on a watch list used in monitoring overseascommunications.By the summer of 1960, the FBI was fully alert to Oswald and to the possibilitythat some sort of espionage game was being played out, even to the extent ofsomeone posing as Oswald. On June 3, 1960, FBI director Hoover wrote to theState Department’s Office of Security, warning, “Since there is a possibilitythat an imposter is using Oswald’s birth certificate, any current informationthe Department of State may have concerning subject will be appreciated.”About this same time, the Marine Corps, informed that Oswald had offered to tellmilitary secrets to the Soviets, took action. After failing to reach Oswald withcertified letters, the Marine Corps officially changed Oswald’s “honorabledischarge” to “dishonorable” on September 13, 1960.But it was Oswald’s mother who seemed to get the swiftest reaction from queriesabout her son. After phone calls to the FBI and letters to her congressmenfailed to turn up information about her son, Mrs. Oswald spent her small savingson a train ticket to Washington. Arriving on January 28, 1961, she called theWhite House wanting to speak to President Kennedy, who had been inaugurated onlyeight days before.Failing to reach the president, she asked to speak to Secretary of State DeanRusk. Instead, she was granted an immediate interview with Eugene Boster, WhiteHouse Soviet affairs officer. Although she had not heard from her son in morethan a year and his trip to Russia allegedly was made entirely on his own, Mrs.Oswald quoted Boster as saying, “Oh, yes, Mrs. Oswald, I’m familiar with thecase.” As before, she charged that her son was working for the US government anddemanded that the government locate him in Russia.On February 1, 1961, less than a week after Mrs. Oswald’s Washington visit, theState Department sent a “Welfare-Whereabouts” memo to Moscow. On February 13,1961, the US embassy in Moscow received a letter from Oswald dated February 5,stating, “I desire to return to the United States, that is if we could come tosome agreement concerning the dropping of any legal proceedings against me.”Secretary Snyder was understandably astonished that Oswald should write to himjust after he had been asked to locate the ex-Marine. Mrs. Oswald saw therapidity of the response from her son as an indication the US government was incontact with her son while in Russia.The Warren Commission attributed Oswald’s sudden reappearance to merecoincidence, in light of the fact that routine queries about Oswald had not yetbeen initiated by the American embassy.In his letter, Oswald again showed unusual knowledge of the legalities ofcitizenship. He pointed out that he had never “taken Russian citizenship” andadded, “If I could show [the Soviets] my American passport, I am of the opinionthey would give me an exit visa.”Perhaps recalling Hoover’s memo of the previous summer, the State Departmentinformed Snyder that Oswald’s passport was to be delivered in person.On May 16, 1961, after some written sparring with the embassy, Oswald furthercomplicated the entire matter by writing:Since my last letter I have gotten married. . . . My wife is Russian, born inLeningrad, she has no parents living and is quite willing to leave the SovietUnion with me and live in the United States. . . . I would not leave herewithout my wife so arrangements would have to be made for her to leave at thesame time I do.Oswald was ready to return to the United States, but only with his new bride.A Whirlwind Romance [Contents.html#rsec27]A little more than a month after telling the American embassy that he wished toreturn home, Oswald met the Russian woman who would become his wife and a chiefwitness against him after the assassination.Around March 17, 1961—nobody seems to be certain of the date, includingMarina—Oswald attended a trade union dance at the Palace of Culture in Minsk.Here he met nineteen-year-old Marina Nikolaevna Prusakova, who was the hit ofthe party in a red brocade dress and hairstyle “à la Brigitte Bardot.” Oswaldwas introduced to her as “Alik” and soon they were dancing.Marina said they spoke Russian and she believed “Alik” to be a Soviet citizen,but from the Baltic area—Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania—based on his accent. Shewas greatly surprised to learn this man was really an American named Lee HarveyOswald.After the dance, Oswald and Marina visited in the home of friends, where Oswaldspoke up in defense of the United States, saying that while there were defectssuch as unemployment and discrimination, there still was “more democracy.”Oswald wrote in his “diary,” We are going steady, and I decide I must have her,she puts me off, so on April 15 I propose, she accepts.”They married on April 30, less than six weeks after first meeting.In later years, Marina exhibited a strange memory loss about many aspects oftheir meeting, whirlwind romance, and wedding. She told varying stories as towho first introduced her to Oswald, and then finally stated she just couldn’tremember. She also told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that Oswaldhad proposed to her “a month and a half” before their wedding. This would meanOswald proposed the first night they met. However, this was by no means the onlyinconsistency in Marina’s recollections.Marina claimed to be born on July 17, 1941, in the northern seaside town ofMolotovsk. A war baby, she never knew who her father was and took her mother’sname. In the book Marina and Lee, she suddenly revealed that she had found outthat her father was a Soviet traitor named Nikolai Didenko. This may be a smallmatter, but it was never revealed to the Warren Commission. Her mother left heras an infant with elderly relatives in Arkhangelsk, where she grew up untilrejoining her mother at age seven. By then her mother had married an electricalworker named Alexander Medvedev and by 1952, the family was living in Leningrad.Here Marina attended a pharmacist school.Upon graduation in June 1959, she was assigned a job in a pharmaceuticalwarehouse, but quit after only one day and spent the rest of the summer onvacation. At the end of the summer, she went to Minsk to live with her maternaluncle, Colonel Ilya Vasilyevich Prusakov, a ranking officer in the MVD (theSoviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, portions of which functioned as secretpolice), a leading citizen in Minsk, and a Communist Party member.It was at her uncle’s urging that she attended the dance where she met Oswald.Marina’s uncle apparently never protested her marriage, although his positioncould have allowed him to study Oswald’s KGB file, which must have shown thatOswald had written to the American embassy about returning to the United States,since it is now known that the KGB was keeping him under surveillance.Within a matter of days after their marriage, Oswald told Marina he wanted toreturn to the United States. Soon Marina began to apply for the documentsnecessary to leave the Soviet Union. Her exit visas appear to have beenexpedited even though there were several problems with her backgroundinformation. She stated her name as “Marina Nikolaevna,” which indicated herfather’s name was Nikolai. She insisted, however, that she never knew the nameof her father. Her birth certificate identified her birthplace as Severodvinsk.This was the name given to Molotovsk, but not until 1957. Furthermore, sincebeing a member of the Communist Party might cause problems in leaving Russia,she denied any membership. Actually, she was a member of the Komsomol, theCommunist Party’s youth movement.These discrepancies did not escape the notice of the CIA. Shortly after theassassination, a CIA memorandum noted:At the time [the agency] was becoming increasingly interested in watchingdevelop a pattern that we had discovered in the course of our bio[graphical] andresearch work: the number of Soviet women marrying foreigners, being permittedto leave the USSR, then eventually divorcing their spouses and settling downabroad without returning “home.” . . . We eventually turned up something liketwo dozen similar cases.Noting that the birth certificate Marina brought to the United States was issuedJuly 19, 1961, and that she had to have one to obtain a marriage license, authorEdward Epstein concluded, “It thus seemed that new documents—and possibly a newidentity—were furnished to Marina after it was decided that she would accompanyOswald to the United States.”On July 8, 1961, Oswald had flown to Moscow to retrieve his passport at theAmerican embassy. Since he had never technically defected, his passport waspromptly returned, although the State Department cautioned the embassy toproceed carefully in Oswald’s “involved case” and to make sure “that the personin communication with the Embassy is . . . Lee Harvey Oswald.”Accounts of Oswald’s time during this period are filled with inconsistencies.For example, in his diary he claims to have returned to Minsk from Moscow onJuly 14. However, on August 1, Rita Naman and two other tourists reportedmeeting a young American in Moscow and snapping his picture. Two photos made bythese tourists were displayed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations,which concluded the young American was Oswald.With all their applications made, the Oswalds settled down to wait for approvalto leave Russia.To further complicate the situation, a baby girl—June Lee Oswald—was born toMarina on February 15, 1962. On May 10, the Oswalds heard from the Americanembassy that everything was in order and that they should come to Moscow to signthe final papers.It was during this time that Marina noted a cooling in Oswald’s attitude towardher. He became reclusive and irritable. This coolness was to increase after theyleft Russia. “Lee changed,” Marina told the Warren Commission. “I did not knowhim as such a man in Russia.” It was almost as if he had made up the story ofhis love and instead was simply following some sort of orders in his courtship.Afterward, with his assignment completed, he didn’t bother to act like his lovewas real.On May 24, 1962, the Oswalds again were in Moscow to attend to the final detailsof their departure from Russia. On June 1, Oswald signed a promissory note atthe American embassy for a repatriation loan of $435.71, the money needed forhis return, and the couple boarded a train that same evening.Their trip home also has nagging indications of intelligence handling. TheWarren Commission said the couple crossed out of communist territory at Brest.Yet Marina’s passport was stamped at Helmstedt, one of the major checkpoints onthe East German border. Intriguingly, Oswald’s passport shows no Helmstedt stampat all, raising the possibility that he somehow traveled a different route fromMarina.Arriving in Amsterdam, the Oswalds stayed not in a hotel, but in a privateestablishment recommended by someone in the American embassy in Moscow,according to Marina. She described this place variously as a “private apartment”and as a “boardinghouse.” While the official record shows they stayed here onlyone night, after the assassination Marina recalled a three-day stay and shereacted with confusion when questioned about this by the House Select Committeeon Assassinations. She did note that advance arrangements had been made at thisplace and that their hosts spoke English.Many researchers suspect that Oswald, and perhaps Marina, were “debriefed” by USintelligence during their Dutch stopover. Even the chief counsel of the WarrenCommission called the episode “unexplained.”Furthermore, in a statement to the Secret Service just after the assassination,Marina gave a version of their trip from Russia that was totally different fromthat given in the Warren Report. She claimed they “then arrived in New York byair . . . stayed in some hotel in New York City for one day and then went bytrain to Texas.”The Warren Commission, backed by tickets, documents, and Marina’s latertestimony, stated that the couple arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey, on June 13,1962, aboard the ship SS Maasdam. There they were met by Spas T. Raikin, arepresentative of the Traveler’s Aid Society, which had been notified of theOswalds’ arrival by the State Department. Raikin helped whisk the Oswaldsthrough customs and then found them a place to stay in New York. He laterarranged contact with Lee’s brother, Robert, who sent the couple $200 for planefare to Fort Worth, Texas.According to BBC researcher and author Anthony Summers, Raikin was also anofficial with an anticommunist émigré group with links to both the FBI and USmilitary intelligence as well as anticommunist groups in New Orleans“headquartered in the very building [544 Camp Street] where, in months to come,Oswald’s name was to be linked with CIA-backed anti-Castro activists.”The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) had approved the financialaid to Oswald upon urging from the State Department. In Dallas HEW records, itstates that Oswald went to Russia “with State Department approval,” anallegation later repeated by Oswald himself on a New Orleans radio program.When the Oswalds arrived in New York, they had seven suitcases. When they leftby plane, they had only five. Asked about the dwindling number, Oswald stated hehad sent them ahead by rail. However, when the couple arrived in Fort Worth,Robert stated they had only two suitcases.The lost baggage may have something to do with their flight to Texas, which,although many direct flights were available, went by way of Atlanta. Atlanta wasthe home of Natasha Davison, the mother of Captain Davison, the US attaché withintelligence connections who had met with the Oswalds in Moscow.Yet, with all this evidence suggesting that Marina may have been part of someunrevealed intelligence program, she was accepted publicly by the WarrenCommission as “a simple, devoted housewife.” Privately, Commission membersthought differently. At one point, they voiced the fear that she might be a KGBagent. Commission member Senator Richard Russell commented, “That will blow thelid if she testifies to that.” One Warren Commission lawyer described Marina as“a very different person [from her public image] . . . cold, calculating,avaricious.”Some believe that Marina lied in many instances during her testimony to theWarren Commission. But keep in mind that the testimony of Oswald’s wife wouldnot have been admissible had Oswald come to trial.Despite all this, some of Marina’s testimony proved very damaging to Oswald. Inthe hours after the assassination, Marina was quoted as saying, “Lee good man.Lee not shoot anyone.” But after she was held for weeks by the federalauthorities, her statements began to change. Instead of describing what a goodhusband Oswald had been, she began saying he was violent to her. After initiallybeing unable to identify the Carcano rifle as her husband’s, she later describedit as “the fateful rifle of Lee Harvey Oswald.” She also began to tell storiesof other attempts at assassination by Oswald—one against Richard Nixon andanother against General Edwin Walker.Today Marina has reversed her statements of 1963–1964. More mature, with a goodcommand of English, she has publicly made several astounding admissions,including:—How federal authorities forced her Warren Commission testimony by threateningdeportation and ordered her not to read or listen to anything pertaining to theassassination.—That today she believes a conspiracy resulted in Kennedy’s death.—Lee Harvey Oswald was an agent who “worked for the American government” and was“caught between two powers—the government and organized crime.”—Oswald was “killed to keep his mouth shut.”—That someone impersonated Oswald to incriminate him and “that’s no joke.”—Lee Harvey Oswald “adored” President Kennedy.In a 1988 interview published in Ladies’ Home Journal, Marina said:When I was questioned by the Warren Commission, I was a blind kitten. Theirquestioning left me only one way to go: guilty. I made Lee guilty. He never hada fair chance. . . . But I was only 22 then, and I’ve matured since; I thinkdifferently.[images/line.jpg]By 1979, Marina had begun to doubt the official explanation of the assassinationand even joined in efforts to have Oswald’s body exhumed due to seriousquestions concerning its identity. More on that later.Considering the background of both Lee and Marina and the length of time Oswaldspent in Russia, it seems inconceivable that they were not interrogated by USintelligence after their return. Yet the official story is that no USintelligence agency had any interest in this ex-Marine.Considering the Marine career of Oswald and the military information availableto him as a radar operator, it is equally unbelievable that the Soviets did notinterrogate Oswald at great length, especially if they found out about hisconnections with the U-2 flights from Atsugi.Yet, this is precisely what the Soviets claimed in what has to be one of themost bizarre aspects of the Kennedy assassination—an aspect kept from theAmerican public by the Warren Commission.A Soviet Defector’s Story [Contents.html#rsec28]The strange story of Yuri Nosenko began on January 20, 1964, just two monthsafter the events in Dallas.Nosenko, an officer in the American Division of the KGB, had contacted the CIAinitially on June 3, 1962, just two days after Oswald left Russia for the UnitedStates. Nosenko offered to spy for the Americans. However, nothing further hadbeen heard from him and US analysts were highly suspicious of his offer.Then on January 20, 1964, Nosenko landed in Geneva as part of a Sovietdisarmament delegation. He soon made his way to a telephone and renewed hisoffer to American intelligence, but with a difference—this time he wanted todefect. His defection set in motion a chain of events that would lead to bitterdivisions between the CIA and FBI as well as within the CIA itself.Once he was in American hands, CIA officials were shocked to learn that Nosenkoclaimed to have been the KGB official who had personally handled the case of LeeHarvey Oswald during his stay in Russia. Nosenko said—based on two mentalexaminations made of Oswald—the KGB found the would-be defector not very brightand even “mentally unstable.” and that the KGB had never debriefed Oswald abouthis military background or ever considered recruiting him as an agent.That was exactly what many people in the CIA and on the Warren Commission wantedto hear. However, others in the agency were immediately suspicious of this man.After all, it appeared Nosenko had forever left a ranking position and hisfamily simply to assure the US government that the man accused of killing thepresident was not a Soviet agent.CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton was particularly wary ofNosenko. He observed that most of the information Nosenko provided revealingSoviet agents and operations was already known to the CIA prior to hisdefection. Furthermore, shortly after bringing Nosenko to the United States, CIAinterrogators began to find errors and gaps in his testimony.To make matters worse, Nosenko’s story was corroborated by one of the FBI’sdeepest secrets—their own Soviet KGB defector referred to only by his code name,Fedora. Thus, if Nosenko was lying, then Fedora, too, became suspect.In a remarkable attempt to resolve the issue, Nosenko underwent “hostileinterrogation,” nothing new since 9/11 but shocking back then. He was kept insolitary confinement for 1,277 days under intense physical and psychologicalpressure. He was put on a diet of weak tea, macaroni, and porridge, he was givennothing to read, a light was left burning in his unheated cell twenty-four hoursa day, and his guards were forbidden to speak with him or even smile. Toward theend of this ordeal, Nosenko was given at least two lie detector tests by theCIA. He failed both. But Nosenko did not crack.The believers of Nosenko, headed by the CIA’s Richard Helms and J. Edgar Hoover,took his intransigence to mean that he was telling the truth about the KGB’shaving no interest in Oswald. But doubts remained. So at the CIA’s request, theWarren Commission obligingly made no reference to Nosenko.The counterintelligence faction, led by Angleton, still believed that the KGBcontrived Nosenko’s defection for two purposes: to allay suspicions that theSoviets had anything to do with the JFK assassination and to cover for Soviet“moles,” or agents deep within US intelligence.Through the 1980s, Nosenko continued to be an adviser on Soviet intelligence tothe CIA and the FBI at a salary of more than $35,000 a year. He has been given anew identity as well as more than $150,000 as payment for his ordeal.There appears to be evidence that Oswald continued to keep in touch with Sovietofficials almost up until the time of Kennedy’s assassination. According to CIAdocuments, Oswald visited the Soviet embassy in Mexico City on September 23,1963, and met with Valery Vladimirovich Kostikov, who was described as a consulin the Soviet embassy. However, a CIA memorandum added, “[Kostikov] is alsoknown to be a staff officer of the KGB. He is connected with the Thirteenth, or‘liquid affairs’ department, whose responsibilities include assassination andsabotage.”Of course, Oswald’s contact with this man, who was operating as a normal memberof the Soviet embassy, may have been coincidental. However, it is significantthat the Warren Commission, aware of the implication of this contact, failed topursue the matter or include this information in its report, though this contactsubsequently was used to paint Oswald as a would-be Soviet assassin.Years later, FBI agent James Hosty, who was connected to Oswald prior to theassassination, said he was unhappy with the revelation about Kostikov’s KGB tiesand that, had he been made aware of this connection by the CIA, he would haveplaced Oswald’s name on the bureau’s “Security Index” of individuals to monitor.Two theories have emerged:One, Oswald was recruited by the KGB while serving in Japan and was encouragedto defect to Russia, then sent back to the United States to kill PresidentKennedy. This theory is rejected by most students of the subject, includingauthor Edward Jay Epstein, whose book Legend studied the Oswald-Sovietconnections in detail. Epstein reasoned, “I think that the fact that Oswaldtraces so clearly back to the Russians makes it extremely unlikely that theywould have recruited him as an assassin.”Second, Oswald, whether genuine or substitute, was recruited into USintelligence as a spy and sent to Russia. There, the KGB attempted to turn himinto their agent and sent him back to the United States, unaware that he wouldbe blamed for Kennedy’s death. This would explain the extraordinary lengths bythe Soviets to disavow any connection with Oswald.In the overall view, Oswald obviously was mixed up in some sort of intelligencework. And while it is likely that the Soviets would attempt to recruit thislowly Marine and would-be defector, it is highly unlikely that they wouldconsider using him in something so dangerous as assassinating the US president.In murdering Kennedy, the Soviets would have been risking all. World War IIIwould be the likely result should a Soviet assassination plot be uncovered. Andwhat would they have gained by killing Kennedy? Virtually nothing, exceptpromoting Lyndon Johnson to be president. Johnson had far stronger anticommunistcredentials than Kennedy with much closer ties to the military-industrialcomplex most feared by the Soviets.Such thinking was confirmed in later years when it was learned that on the dayafter the assassination Nikolai T. Fedorenko of the Soviet Union Mission to theUnited Nations met with all Russian diplomatic personnel at the Soviet Mission.Fedorenko stated that Kennedy’s death had caused considerable shock in Sovietgovernment circles and was very much regretted by the Soviet Union.According to documents obtained by the Assassinations Records Review Board, bythe fall of 1965, Colonel Boris Ivanov, chief of the Soviet Committee for StateSecurity, told Soviet KGB personnel in New York City that the KGB was inpossession of data purporting to indicate President Johnson was responsible forKennedy’s assassination. He ordered all operatives to obtain all the informationavailable on Johnson, his background and associates.In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, even after hearing theNosenko story, concluded, “The committee believes, on the basis of the evidenceavailable to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in theassassination of President Kennedy.”But perhaps the best argument against Soviet involvement comes from the memoirsof the highest-ranking Soviet official ever to defect to the West. In his 1985book, Breaking with Moscow, Arkady N. Shevchenko wrote:Our leaders would not have been so upset by the assassination if they hadplanned it and the KGB would not have taken upon itself to venture such a movewithout Politburo approval. . . . Moscow firmly believed that Kennedy’sassassination was a scheme by “reactionary forces” within the United Statesseeking to damage the new trend in relations. The Kremlin ridiculed the WarrenCommission’s conclusion that Oswald had acted on his own as the sole assassin.There was in fact widespread speculation among Soviet diplomats that LyndonJohnson, along with the CIA and the Mafia, had masterminded the plot. Perhapsone of the most potent reasons why the U.S.S.R. wished Kennedy well was thatJohnson was anathema to Khrushchev. Because he was a southerner, Moscowconsidered him a racist (the stereotype of any American politician from belowthe Mason-Dixon line), an anti-Soviet and anti-communist to the core. Further,since Johnson was from Texas, a center of the most reactionary forces in theUnited States, according to the Soviets, he was associated with the big-timecapitalism of the oil industry, also known to be anti-Soviet.A final argument against Soviet involvement is that while it is conceivable thatthe Russians somehow contrived Kennedy’s death and that high-level US governmentofficials were forced to cover this up to prevent a devastating world war, itmakes no sense that these facts would not have been leaked slowly to theAmerican public in the late 1960s and early 1970s in an effort to gain supportfor the anticommunist war in Vietnam and to blunt the growing antiwar movement.The fact that Russian assassination plans didn’t surface goes far to prove thathard evidence of Soviet involvement in Kennedy’s death is nonexistent. But ifthe Russians had nothing to do with the assassination, what about their protégéson the island of Cuba?"},{"pageContent":"Cubans [Contents.html#rch5]In a 1952 military coup, former Cuban army sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizedcontrol of Cuba, which had been under US trusteeship since the Spanish-AmericanWar of 1898. A dictator and a despot, Batista nevertheless was supported by theUnited States and worked closely with many American groups, especially organizedcriminals.By the late 1950s, Cuba was a mecca for American gamblers, tourists, investors,and offshore banking speculators.Only one man seemed determined to overthrow Batista—a young attorney named FidelCastro.Fidel Castro [Contents.html#rsec29]Born the son of a Spanish-born plantation owner on August 13, 1926, FidelAlejandro Castro Ruz had an active boyhood in rural eastern Cuba. He oncethreatened to burn the house down if his parents didn’t send him to school.In 1952, he ran for Parliament but was stymied when the dictator Batistacanceled the elections. From that time on, Castro devoted himself to oustingBatista.Gathering some followers, Castro made his first assault on Batista on July 26,1953, attacking the dictator’s Moncada Barracks. The attack was a militarydisaster. Captured and tried, the youthful Castro proclaimed, “Condemn me. Itdoes not matter. History will absolve me.”Sentenced to fifteen years in prison, Castro was released after twenty-twomonths. He then fled to Mexico, where he began reorganizing his guerrillafighters. He used the brutality displayed by Batista at the Moncada Barracks asa rallying point and named his revolution the “26th of July Movement” after thedisastrous attack. Since 1959, this date has been celebrated as CubanIndependence Day.In 1956, Castro swam the Rio Grande and entered the United States to arrange thepurchase of a dilapidated yacht named the Granma. Returning to Mexico, he beganplanning the next stage of his revolution—the invasion of his homeland.Confident that he would rapidly gain followers, Castro even made his invasionplans public.On December 2, 1956, when he and eighty-two guerrillas waded ashore on theswampy coast of his native Oriente Province, Batista’s soldiers were waiting inambush. Only twelve guerrillas, including Castro, survived and escaped into theSierra Maestra mountains.After Batista proclaimed his death, Castro invited a reporter for the New YorkTimes to his camp to show he was very much alive, and he predicted that finalvictory would be his.After several years of basic survival in the mountains—during this time, Castrogrew his now-famous beard—the young revolutionary and his followers began totake the initiative. By the summer of 1958, his guerrilla band had grown to morethan eight hundred, and later that year a detachment led by Ernesto “Che”Guevara captured the provincial capital of Santa Clara in central Cuba.Although backed by an army of some 30,000, Batista panicked and decided to quitthe island. Taking bags of cash, Batista fled to the Dominican Republic in thefirst few hours of 1959.Castro’s fantasy revolution had suddenly become a dream come true. For twoweeks, Castro slowly moved toward Havana. The excitement and passions of themoment were almost overpowering. Veteran news correspondents could not recall amore jubilant scene since the liberation of Paris in World War II. For a periodof weeks, the jubilation continued, but then became subdued in the wake oftrials and executions of prerevolution “war criminals.”[images/line.jpg]With the defeat of Batista, Castro became the undisputed leader of Cuba, evenproclaiming himself “Jefe Maximo” (maximum leader). And he began making drasticchanges in the island.Castro closed down the gambling casinos and houses of prostitution that had beenthe source of an estimated $100 million a year for organized crime in the UnitedStates. He nationalized the sugar industry, the backbone of Cuba’s economy, andby the summer of 1960, he had seized more than $700 million in US property,including banks that had been accused of laundering money for Americaninterests. (Even his parents’ plantation was nationalized, angering his ownmother and prompting his younger sister Juanita to leave Cuba and become ananti-Castroite.)Some social gains were made on the island. Within a few years, illiteracy hadbeen reduced from 24 percent to 4 percent. But Castro also proclaimed that hewas the leader of socialist revolution in South America, although he stronglymaintained that he was not a communist. American interests were quick torespond. The US government abruptly restricted sugar imports and beganencouraging its allies not to trade with Castro.With his trade restricted and hearing rumors that the United States might invadethe island at any time, Castro turned to the Soviet Union for support. He beganselling sugar to Russia in 1960 and soon Soviet technicians and advisers beganto arrive on the island. This confirmed the suspicions of American interests,who began to brand Castro a communist who subverted the status quo in Centraland South America.As Castro’s social, economic, and agricultural reforms continued, often withbrutal effectiveness, Cubans began to split into two factions—the Fidelistas(supporters of Castro) and the anti-Castroites, many of whom fled Cuba. By theend of the first year of Castro’s takeover, more than 100,000 Cubans were livingin the United States.As the United States stepped up its program of isolating Cuba—first with cuttingoff the island’s sugar markets and oil supplies, then through diplomaticmaneuvers with other South American countries, and finally by introducing armsand saboteurs into Cuba—Castro grew more and more fearful of an armed invasionby the United States.On January 3, 1961, the United States ended diplomatic relations with Cuba afterCastro demanded the US embassy staff be cut to only eleven persons. Castrocharged that 80 percent of the staff was “FBI and Pentagon spies.” In 1961 mostAmericans had never heard of the CIA, a then little-known and super-secretorganization, much like the National Security Agency today. Two weeks later, theUnited States forbade its citizens to travel to Cuba. In the same month, themonth that John F. Kennedy took office as president, Castro placed his militiaon twenty-four-hour alert, proclaiming that the “Yankee invasion” was imminent.In February, Soviet deputy prime minister Andrei Gromyko arrived in Cuba toarrange large-scale economic and military assistance to Castro.And on April 17, 1961, less than three months after Kennedy became president,Castro’s fears were realized. A force of anti-Castro Cubans backed by the UnitedStates landed at the Bay of Pigs.Disaster at the Bay of Pigs [Contents.html#rsec30]The plans to destroy Castro and regain control of Cuba began while Eisenhowerwas in office, more than a year before Kennedy became president.By early 1960, the thousands of Cuban refugees in the United States had begunforming small groups dedicated to regaining their homeland, each claiming to bethe one true voice of the exiles. To bring order to this situation, the CIA inMay 1960 helped create a Cuban coalition that came to be known as the CubanRevolutionary Council. Early on, this task was handled by CIA officer E. HowardHunt—later to be involved in the Watergate affair and to be accused of being inDallas the day Kennedy was killed.Secrecy was the prime concern of everyone involved. Even CIA director AllenDulles did not know many details of the plan. He had simply turned the wholeproject over to a deputy director, Richard M. Bissell Jr. Bissell, in turn,handed the project to the former CIA station chief in Caracas, who recruitedvarious CIA personnel, such as Hunt, Tracy Barnes, and David Atlee Phillips.Many of the CIA officers involved in the Bay of Pigs had participated in the1954 overthrow of the popularly elected government of Jacobo Arbenz inGuatemala, and their intent was to stage a similar low-key coup in Cuba.Unknown to these CIA officers who began to create a Cuban-refugee fightingforce, Bissell was working on a concurrent project—the assassination of FidelCastro.Bissell’s idea began to work its way through the CIA bureaucracy with unintendedhumorous results. Plans were conceived to poison Castro’s cigar, to slip him adepilatory so his famous beard would fall out, or administer an LSD-typechemical so that the Cuban leader would hallucinate. These schemes took on amore sinister aspect, however, with the suggestion that American gangsters behired to do the job.President Dwight Eisenhower knew none of this. All he knew was that on March 17,1960, at the urging of a top-secret committee for covert operations—known as the5412 Committee because it was authorized by National Security Council Directive5412/2—he had authorized a CIA plan titled “A Program of Covert Action Againstthe Castro Regime.” This plan offered a four-point program: (1) creating a Cubangovernment in exile, (2) constructing a “powerful” propaganda offensive, (3)creating a “covert intelligence and action organization” inside Cuba, and (4)developing “a paramilitary force outside of Cuba for future guerrilla action.”This “paramilitary force” was to evolve into Brigade 2506, a Cuban-exileexpeditionary force supported by US air and sea power.One man who did understand what all this might mean was Eisenhower’s vicepresident, White House action officer, and head of the 5412 Committee—Richard M.Nixon. Nixon had several reasons for supporting action against Castro. A yearearlier, the anticommunist Nixon had met with Castro and concluded, “Castro iseither incredibly naïve about communism or is under communist discipline.” Asone of the congressmen who passed the legislation creating the CIA, Nixonundoubtedly wanted to support the men who through the years had passed alonginformation politically helpful to him. Then, too, the November election wasapproaching and Nixon was eager to have the Republican administration get thecredit for ending Castro’s reign. His close ties to organized-crime figures alsomay have played a role.Whatever his reasons, Nixon kept exhorting his executive assistant for nationalsecurity affairs, General Robert E. Cushman Jr., to press the CIA officers foraction.Meanwhile, Hunt and an associate, Bernard L. Barker (who later participated inthe Watergate break-in under Hunt’s guidance), were wheeling and dealing in theMiami Cuban exile community, sometimes carrying as much as $115,000 in abriefcase to secure agents. Training camps were located, arms secured, andCubans recruited. The plan was advancing into broader and grander stages andstill the lower-level operators were in charge.On July 23, 1960, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy was first briefed byDulles about the Cuban operation. At that time only guerrilla infiltration andair drops were contemplated; Kennedy did not learn of the full invasion planuntil after his election, a key point to remember.Shortly after the election, Dulles—along with Bissell—again briefed Kennedy onthe Cuban plan. This briefing, too, was long on vague generalities and short ondetails.It was not until near the end of 1960 that anyone outside of the CIA officers incharge were told that the plan had been expanded to include an invasion with airsupport. Even military brass, who were being asked for material assistance, weresworn to secrecy. Most of those ranking military officers brought into the planthought the whole thing sounded “impractical.”The invasion was indeed impractical, because first, it was predicated on amassive revolt against Castro by the Cuban people, a concept loudly advanced bythe CIA analysts but doubted by most others involved. Second, it was apparentthat to succeed, the invasion had to have the support of US naval and air power,a contingency both Eisenhower and Kennedy had opposed.By mid-March 1961—with the invasion only a month away—Kennedy was having secondthoughts. The Trinidad Plan, an invasion proposal hastily put together by thePentagon, was rejected by the new president as “too spectacular,” with itsamphibious assault, air strikes, and the landing of a provisional government.Kennedy wanted something quiet, something that would not reveal US involvement.A week before the invasion, Kennedy left no doubt as to his position on using USmilitary forces to help the Cuban exiles. The New York Times carried atwo-column headline reading: PRESIDENT BARS USING US FORCE TO OUST CASTRO. TheCuban exiles were aghast, but their CIA officers quietly assured them that noone would stand by and watch them die. Miscommunication was rampant up and downthe chain of command.Kennedy, advised that the invasion had been approved by the previousadministration, was faced with a fait accompli. Reluctantly he gave his approvaland on Saturday, April 15, 1961, less than three months after Kennedy tookoffice, a force of six B-26 bombers left a secret airfield in Nicaragua forCuba. It was to have been sixteen, but Kennedy ordered a reduction to “minimum”scale.This weekend air strike was a partial success. Castro’s tiny air force wascaught on the ground. Only three T-33 jets—considered good only astrainers—along with two B-26 bombers and a few decrepit British Sea Furiesescaped the bombing raid. But it was enough.On Monday, April 17, the Cuban Brigade landed at Bahia de Cochinos or Bay ofPigs (named after the wild boars that inhabited this desolate area of Cuba)under the code name Zapata. Ironically, Castro knew the area intimately since itwas his favorite hunting spot. It was a good location for a landing, with onlytwo main road arteries leading past swamps and dense undergrowth. But this sameattribute also made it a formidable trap should Castro’s forces arrive quicklyand in force.A second air strike had been planned and, by most accounts, would have completedthe destruction of Castro’s air force. However, the CIA planners had failed toreckon with John F. Kennedy. Kennedy hesitated, growing more and more concernedthat the entire world was realizing that the United States was supporting thisinvasion of another country. His concern was a far cry from Washington’spolicies of today. Today, it is known that failure to order in the second strikeactually came from Air Force General Charles Cabell, who as deputy director ofthe CIA helped organize the invasion. It has been suggested that cancellation ofthe second air strike actually was part of a plan to discredit Kennedy and forcehim into more conciliation with the military intelligence communities.United Nations ambassador Adlai Stevenson, who had been lied to by the CIA aboutUS involvement, was also discredited after telling the General Assembly that theUnited States had nothing to do with the invasion.Although the Cuban Brigade already was running into trouble on the beaches—oneof their ships, the Houston, was set afire by Castro’s planes while an escortingship, the Barbara, was fired upon by its own side for failing to pick up Houstonsurvivors. Researchers have pondered over the fact that George H. W. Bush,married to a Barbara, has been accused of using his Houston oil firm, ZapataPetroleum Corp., as a front for the anti-Castro Cubans prior to the Bay of PigsInvasion. In addition, his father, Connecticut senator Prescott Bush, wasinstrumental in creating the CIA.Secretary of state Dean Rusk was concerned that the “international noise level”had risen to an intolerable degree. Rusk argued that no further air strikes beattempted until it could be made to look like the planes came from capturedCuban airfields. Kennedy concurred. Castro’s surviving planes were able todisrupt the landing, allowing his troops to bottle up the beaches. The Bay ofPigs had become a death trap for the Cuban Brigade.Kennedy authorized US Navy ships sitting offshore to help evacuate the Brigade,but the Cuban commanders didn’t want evacuation. They wanted the ammunition,naval support, and “umbrella” of air cover that had been promised to them. Itnever came. As the remnants of the Brigade called for help from the beaches, USmilitary men could only stand silent by their weapons and watch as the gallantCuban Brigade was torn to bits.As news of the debacle spread, everybody concerned was furious.Kennedy felt betrayed. He believed he had been led down a primrose path byoverly optimistic CIA officials. The CIA planners felt betrayed in that theactual invasion had been scaled down on Kennedy’s orders. The military feltbetrayed because they had not been allowed to help plan the invasion. And theCuban exiles felt betrayed most of all because they had been led to believe theyhad the full support of the US government. Thanks to gossip from their superiorsand CIA advisers, many believed—and still do—that Kennedy was totallyresponsible for the failure of the invasion.In Guatemala City, staging area for the Brigade, the CIA officers weredevastated. Many were getting drunk. CIA station chief Robert Davis describedthem this way: “If someone had gotten close to Kennedy, he’d have killed him.Oh, they hated him!”Of the men of the Cuban Brigade, 114 were killed, 1,202 were captured byCastro’s forces, and 150 either never landed or made their way back to safety.The captured Brigade was finally freed on December 23, 1962, after the UnitedStates agreed to exchange them for $53 million worth of food and drugs.Infuriated by this disastrous defeat, Kennedy nevertheless took the burden ofblame. He told reporters, “There’s an old saying that victory has a hundredfathers and defeat is an orphan. What mattered was only one fact: I am theresponsible officer of government.”No one—especially in the CIA, the military, organized crime, or in the Cubanexile community—would forget this acceptance of responsibility.[images/line.jpg]Following a shake-up in US intelligence over the Bay of Pigs disaster—Kennedyfired Dulles and Cabell—attorney general Robert Kennedy took over responsibilityfor Cuban affairs.Soon another war—this one much darker and more secret—was being waged againstCastro under the code name “JM/WAVE.” This program operated on the campus of theUniversity of Miami under the cover of an electronics firm called ZenithTechnological Services. On November 3, 1961, JM/WAVE came under OperationMongoose, the ongoing covert mission against Castro also known as the “CubanProject.” It was headed by Air Force General Edward Lansdale, alreadyacknowledged as an expert on nation building due to his fighting communists inthe Philippines following World War II. He advocated action in the social,economic, and political aspects of a country as well as aggressive militaryoperations. A 1958 book titled The Ugly American was a thinly disguised accountof the experiences of Lansdale and others in Southeast Asia.By mid-1962, Operation Mongoose involved nearly 600 CIA case officers, as manyas 3,000 contract agents, and numerous fronts such as boat shops, detective andtravel agencies, and gun stores. With nearly a quarter million Cuban refugeesliving in the United States, it was easy to find those with a burning passion toliberate their island and return home.The operation out of the JM/WAVE station was inconsistent from the start.President Kennedy stated “all actions should be kept at a low key,” while hisbrother Robert told CIA officials “no time, money, effort—or manpower—should bespared.”The near-nightly raids on Cuba—landing saboteurs, dropping propaganda leaflets,and conducting occasional military-style raids—actually achieved very littleexcept to confirm Castro’s accusations that the United States was guilty ofaggression.Today several of the military and intelligence officials who were dealing withPresident Kennedy during this period say they believed that the assassination ofCastro was to be a part of this “Cuban crusade.” However, there is no supportingdocumentation, and in fact the only documentation available indicates quite theopposite.Early in 1962, Robert Kennedy was trying to prosecute a top Mafia boss named SamGiancana, when he found the CIA interceding on Giancana’s behalf. Pursuing thematter, Kennedy was finally told about the earlier deals between the CIA andMafia to kill Castro. According to CIA attorney Lawrence Houston, the attorneygeneral ordered a halt to dealings with the Mafia. The younger Kennedy latertold aides, “I stopped it. . . . I found out that some people were going to tryan attempt on Castro’s life and I turned it off.”However, the lethal partnership between the agency and the crime syndicatedidn’t stop until well after President Kennedy was assassinated, indicating theCIA continued to operate out of control even after the agency shake-up followingthe Bay of Pigs disaster.Whatever the Kennedys’ role in Castro assassination plots, they got nowhere.Castro outlived both Kennedys and there is now some evidence to suggest that theCIA-Mafia plots may have been nothing more than a “scam” on the part oforganized crime to gain leverage over the government.The ongoing tension with Cuba took on a more serious and urgent tone when onOctober 22, 1962, Kennedy announced that US reconnaissance aircraft—the same U-2spy plane that had ended Eisenhower’s hopes for the 1960 summit meeting—hadphotographed offensive missile sites with nuclear capability being constructedin Cuba.President Kennedy called for emergency meetings of the United Nations SecurityCouncil and the Organization of American States. He also ordered a “quarantine”of Cuba and vowed full retaliation against Russia if a nuclear warhead waslaunched from Cuba.As Soviet ships carrying missiles approached the US naval blockade of Cuba, theworld watched and trembled. Nuclear holocaust seemed imminent. Then Americanswere told that the Soviets blinked. Their freighters turned back and everyonebreathed a sigh of relief. Only much later did the American people learn thatKennedy had accepted a proposal from Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev thatincluded a pledge from the United States to remove its missiles from Turkey andnever to invade or support any invasion of Cuba, in exchange for Russia’swithdrawal of the Cuban missiles.But Kennedy’s diplomacy in ending the missile crisis, perhaps unknown to thelower ranks, earned him further rebuke by military and CIA officers who believedthe presence of missiles justified a US invasion of Cuba and the elimination ofthe Castro regime. These suspicions only made the military and intelligenceofficers, along with their Cuban protégés, more convinced that Kennedy was “softon communism.”In March 1962, General Lyman Lemnitzer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,recommended, and the Joint Chiefs approved, a plan to turn public opinionagainst Castro called Operation Northwoods. These plans called for conducting“false-flag” operations in the United States—hijacking American airliners andships, setting off bombs in American cities, and even assassinations. All thiswas to be blamed on Castro’s Cuba.President Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods and demoted Lemnitzer, andsenior military officers ordered the documents destroyed. But someone slipped upand ironically the papers were discovered in the early 1990s by theAssassination Records Review Board, created to gather documents related toKennedy’s assassination.Beginning in 1963, the Cubans found US government support for their continuingefforts against Castro to be nonexistent. In fact, moves were under way to stopexile action against Cuba.The clamp-down on exile activity, whether sincere or official window dressing,marked the beginning of a new relationship with both Cuba and the SovietUnion—and a change of tactics by JFK.Kennedy used Jean Daniel, a journalist with the French newspaper L’Express, asan unofficial contact with Castro. On October 24, 1963, Kennedy met with Danieland urged him to pass along his good intentions to the Cuban premier during ascheduled interview in Havana. Daniel did meet with Castro and reported that theCuban leader said:I believe Kennedy is sincere. I consider him responsible for everything, but Iwill say this . . . in the last analysis, I’m convinced that anyone else wouldbe worse. . . . You can tell him that I’m willing to declare [Sen. Barry]Goldwater my friend if it will guarantee Kennedy’s reelection!Ironically, Daniel was with Castro on November 22, when the Cuban leaderreceived word of Kennedy’s assassination. “Es una mala noticia [This is badnews],” Castro said three times, adding, “All will have to be rethought. I’lltell you one thing; at least Kennedy was an enemy to whom we had becomeaccustomed. You watch and see . . . I know that they will try to put the blameon us for this thing.”Castro was correct. From the day of the assassination, there was an effort tolay the blame on him.But the attempt to reconcile relations with Castro had not been strictlyunofficial. On September 17, 1963, ambassador Seydou Diallo of Guinea in WestAfrica brought word to William Attwood, then a special adviser to the USdelegation to the United Nations and a former US ambassador to Guinea, thatCastro wanted to reach some sort of understanding with the Kennedyadministration. According to Diallo, Castro was unhappy at being forced to alignclosely with the Soviet Union and wanted to normalize relations with the UnitedStates. Attwood reported Diallo’s conversation to his superior, UN ambassadorAdlai Stevenson, who telephoned President Kennedy. Kennedy directed Stevenson tohave Attwood meet with Cuban UN delegate Carlos Lechuga. This led to discreetmeetings between Attwood and Lechuga, where they decided that Attwood wouldtravel to Cuba for direct meetings with Castro.Although these unprecedented approaches to Cuba were strictly secret, it isalmost certain that people within US intelligence were aware of therapprochement. Attorney general Robert Kennedy himself told Attwood the secretmaneuvering was “bound to leak.”Three days after Kennedy’s assassination, Attwood was formally notified thatHavana was ready to proceed with a meeting. President Lyndon Johnson was briefedon the situation, but he turned a cold shoulder. Attwood sadly told authorAnthony Summers, “The word came back that this was to be put on ice for the timebeing, and the time being has been ever since.”Besides Miami, the next largest operational area for militant anti-Castro Cubanswas the city of New Orleans, Lee Harvey Oswald’s birthplace. It was there thatnumerous leads have been developed linking the CIA, the FBI, anti-Castro Cubans,and military intelligence with Oswald.Oswald’s interest in Cuba went back to his Marine days, when he and Marine buddyNelson Delgado toyed with the idea of traveling to Cuba and assisting Castro inhis war against Batista. There was nothing unusual here. That same idea hadcrossed the minds of thousands of daydreaming American schoolboys.But in Oswald’s case, this dream may have taken on some reality. According toDelgado, the Marine Oswald began receiving letters plainly stamped with the sealof the Cuban consulate in Los Angeles. Oswald once traveled to Los Angeles withDelgado, saying his purpose was to “visit the Cuban consulate.” There also werereports of Oswald’s meeting with mysterious strangers, whom Delgado believed hadto do with “the Cuban business.”Gerry Patrick Hemming, a Marine with Oswald who was recruited into the CIA, hastold of meeting Oswald in the Cuban consulate. Hemming, himself working fornaval intelligence, said Oswald seemed to be “an informant or some type of agentworking for somebody.”On April 24, 1963, less than a year after arriving back in Fort Worth fromRussia, Oswald packed a bag and bought a bus ticket for New Orleans, tellingMarina and friends that he couldn’t find a job in Texas.Shortly before leaving for New Orleans, he had written a letter to the Fair Playfor Cuba Committee (FPCC), a pro-Castro organization headquartered in New YorkCity and the object of intense scrutiny by various US intelligence agencies,including the FBI and Army intelligence. Oswald praised Castro and asked forFPCC pamphlets, membership applications, and advice on tactics. He alsomentioned he “was thinking about renting a small office at my own expense.”The FPCC director, V. T. Lee, promptly answered, saying the committee facedserious opposition and warned Oswald against provoking “unnecessary incidentswhich frighten away prospective supporters.” It was advice that Oswald wouldtotally ignore.Staying with relatives in New Orleans, Oswald managed to get a job at theWilliam B. Reily Co., a coffee manufacturer. The company’s owner, William Reily,was a financial backer of the Crusade to Free Cuba Committee, one of the manyfront groups raising money for the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Oswald actuallymay have been placed within Reily as an operative. His job apparently was todistinguish which of the Cuban exiles at both the firm and in New Orleans weregenuine anti-Castroites and which were Castro spies.Through the spring and summer of 1963, Oswald, an avid reader, checked outtwenty-seven books from the New Orleans Library. His reading ran from IanFleming’s James Bond novels to Aldous Huxley and science fiction. Libraryrecords show Oswald also read two books about John F. Kennedy, Profiles inCourage and Portrait of a President. Oswald checked out nothing about Cuba.In fact, it was during this time that a strange incident occurred that throwsfurther doubt on Oswald’s sincerity as a communist sympathizer. In July 1963,Oswald accompanied his uncle, Charles “Dutz” Murret, to a Jesuit seminary inMobile, Alabama, where a cousin was enrolled. Here Oswald made what audiencemembers thought was a well-constructed speech against Soviet-style communism. Hetook the opposite position from his procommunist public posturing over theprevious few months in New Orleans—further evidence that Oswald was living somesort of dual life.Back in New Orleans, this duplicity continued. Although Oswald handed outleaflets for the FPCC and continued to write to the national organization, hisNew Orleans chapter was a complete fraud. He even had his wife sign the name“Hidell” as president of his New Orleans chapter of the FPCC.While there has been no documented evidence—a few letters to the FPCC aside—thatOswald was in contact with any pro-Castro group, he definitely was in touch withanti-Castro Cubans. On August 5, 1963, Oswald entered a store owned by Cubanmilitant Carlos Bringuier, a man with connections to both the CubanRevolutionary Council and the CIA. Oswald told Bringuier and friends that he wasa Marine veteran with experience in guerrilla warfare and offered to train Cubanexiles. Pushing his point, Oswald returned the next day with a Marine trainingmanual, which he left with Bringuier. He again said he wanted to join the fightagainst Castro.Bringuier already was on guard. In his Warren Commission testimony, he said thatsome time earlier he had been interviewed by FBI agent Warren De Brueys, who hadtold him the bureau might try to infiltrate his anti-Castro organization.Three days later, Bringuier was shocked when a friend rushed into his store andsaid that the same man who had wanted to train exiles was on the New Orleansstreets passing out pro-Castro literature. Bringuier and others sought outOswald and confronted him. A crowd gathered as Bringuier railed against this“communist” who had tried to infiltrate the exiles. Losing his temper, Bringuiercursed Oswald, threw his leaflets into the air, then drew back his fist as if tostrike. Oswald, who kept smiling throughout this episode, said, “Okay, Carlos,if you want to hit me, hit me.”But there was no fight. Police arrived and took Oswald, Bringuier, and twoothers into custody. All were charged with disturbing the peace. Oswald tried tocontact his uncle for the $25 bail but failed. His uncle’s daughter, however,contacted a family friend, New Orleans gambler Emile Bruneau, who put up themoney.However, before leaving the New Orleans police station, oddly Oswald asked tospeak to an FBI agent. Despite being outside normal business hours, agent JohnQuigley soon arrived and spent more than an hour with Oswald. His report gaveevery detail of Oswald’s travels and stay in New Orleans and appeared more likea debriefing to the bureau by Oswald than the ramblings of an anti-American.It is interesting to note the impression of Oswald by the New Orleans police.Speaking of the Bringuier episode, Lieutenant Francis Martello later said, “Heseemed to have them set up to create an incident,” while Sergeant Horace Austinrecalled, “[Oswald] appeared as though he is being used by these people.”After this brush with the law, Oswald’s pro-Castro stance became even morepublic. He was soon on New Orleans radio and television telling his pro-Castrostory to a wider audience. Tipped off to Oswald by Bringuier, radio reporterWilliam Stuckey allowed Oswald to expound on his thoughts on Cuba and SouthAmerica. This radio interview is significant in that it was widely used afterthe assassination to “prove” his procommunist credentials.A few days later, armed with information obtained from the FBI and the HouseUn-American Activities Committee, Stuckey and right-wing broadcaster Ed Butlerverbally ambushed Oswald in another radio interview. This interview may haveprovided an accidental peek at Oswald’s real allegiance. Oswald was suddenlyconfronted with his attempted defection to Russia. The pro-Castro Oswald,self-proclaimed secretary of the New Orleans chapter of the FPCC, was suddenlyrevealed to have been a communist sympathizer who had tried to renounce hisAmerican citizenship. Caught off guard, Oswald stammered, “I was under theprotection of the . . . uh . . . that is to say, I was not under the protectionof the American government . . . but I was at all times considered an Americancitizen.”It has been documented that both the CIA and the FBI at that time were makingefforts not only to penetrate the FPCC but also to discredit the pro-Castroorganization. Was revealing Oswald’s Soviet life part of this program?But the most intriguing aspect of Oswald’s stay in New Orleans centered around544 Camp Street.544 Camp Street [Contents.html#rsec31]It was at 544 Camp Street in an old, three-story office building that the pathsof Lee Harvey Oswald, the FBI, the CIA, anti-Castro Cubans, and organized-crimefigures all crossed.Until a few months prior to Oswald’s arrival in New Orleans, the aging buildinghoused the offices of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), the umbrellaanti-Castro organization created by CIA officer E. Howard Hunt.CRC members included Carlos Bringuier, the man who had the much-publicizedstreet encounter with Oswald; Sergio Archaca-Smith, a CRC top official withclose documented ties to CIA operative and pilot David Ferrie; and Carlos PrioSocarras, former president of Cuba before Batista and one of the leading Cubanexiles close to CIA agents E. Howard Hunt, Bernard Barker, and Frank Sturgis(all of later Watergate fame).Prio—who had paid for the yacht Granma Castro used to land his revolutionarieson Cuba—had turned on Castro and become a leading anti-Castroite. It is allegedthat Prio was to have become the new president of Cuba following the ill-fatedBay of Pigs Invasion.Prio once was arrested in a gunrunning conspiracy along with a man named RobertMcKeown. According to evidence developed by the Warren Commission, McKeown hadbeen involved in a deal “running jeeps to Cuba” and other smuggling operationswith Jack Ruby, the man who killed Oswald.In April 1977, before he was scheduled to testify for the House Select Committeeon Assassinations, Prio was found shot in the chest in his Miami Beach garage.The wound was ruled self-inflicted.Although the CRC had left 544 Camp Street by the time Oswald was seen there inthe summer of 1963, there were still plenty of Cuban connections. A sideentrance to 544 Camp Street was 531 Lafayette Street, the address of GuyBanister Associates, a private detective agency. Banister, who the New OrleansStates-Item paper in 1967 claimed helped supply munitions to the Bay of Pigsinvaders, was a former FBI man with connections reaching into the bureau, theCIA, and organized crime as well as the Cuban exiles.In 1978 his secretary, Delphine Roberts, told the Dallas Morning News thatOswald had worked for Banister as “an undercover agent” in the summer of 1963.During that same time, another of Banister’s employees was Oswald’s former CivilAir Patrol leader, David Ferrie, who worked for both the CIA and the New Orleansmob.In the Warren Commission exhibits are some of Oswald’s Fair Play for CubaCommittee leaflets. They are stamped:FPCC544 CAMP STREETNEW ORLEANS, LA.Another intriguing contact point between Oswald, 544 Camp Street, and the Cubanswas Ernesto Rodriguez. Recall that in the summer of 1963 Oswald wrote the FairPlay for Cuba Committee stating he was going to get a small office. During thissame time period, the owner of the 544 Camp Street building, Sam Newman, said hewas approached by a Hispanic man who asked about renting an office and said hewas an electrician by day and wanted to teach Spanish at night.Shortly after the assassination and acting on a tip, authorities talked withRodriguez, who did teach Spanish and whose father was in the electricalbusiness.Rodriguez admitted that he had met Oswald, who apparently wanted to learnSpanish. Rodriguez also said that Oswald had offered to train anti-Castro exilesand, in fact, it was Rodriguez who had sent Oswald to meet Carlos Bringuier.There was plenty of undercover activity going on at 544 Camp Street in thesummer of 1963. The location may have had something to do with it. The buildingwas located close to the New Orleans offices of both the FBI and the CIA, it wasnear the Crescent City Garage where Oswald was seen in the company of FBIagents, and it was just around the corner from the William B. Reily CoffeeCompany, Oswald’s employer.New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison believed it was at 544 Camp Streetthat plans were set in motion that culminated in Dealey Plaza.[images/line.jpg]The CIA reported to the Warren Commission that Oswald’s pro-Castro activitiesincluded an attempt to secure a visa to visit Cuba during a trip to Mexico Cityin late September 1963. The agency apparently went to great lengths to provethat Oswald was in Mexico City at this time, but the effort was not entirelysuccessful. Photographs of a man entering the Soviet embassy and a taperecording made at the time were shown to be of someone other than Oswald.To document Oswald’s visit to the Cuban embassy, the CIA relied on the testimonyof a Mexican who worked at the embassy, Silvia Tirado de Duran. Duran, however,is a dubious witness at best since it is now known that the twenty-six-year-oldwoman was arrested twice following the assassination on orders from the CIA andmay have been coerced into giving false testimony.But again, it is the connections between the assassination and anti-Castrogroups that have always turned up the most intriguing evidence—evidence that haslargely been ignored by US authorities, particularly the Warren Commission.Oswald and the Exiles [Contents.html#rsec32]One of several incidents often cited to connect Lee Harvey Oswald with theanti-Castro Cubans involves one of the most violent of the exile groups, Alpha66, and its founder, Antonio Veciana Blanch.Veciana, a former Cuban bank accountant who turned against Castro, was helpingto conduct raids against the island during the missile crisis and hasconsistently maintained that he was working for the CIA.In the spring of 1963, Kennedy publicly criticized the hit-and-run raids ofAlpha 66, to which Veciana replied publicly, “We are going to attack again andagain.” The militant Cuban leader has claimed to have worked for a CIA officerknown to him as “Maurice Bishop.” According to Veciana, he met with Bishop morethan a hundred times and the CIA officer helped guide the activities of Alpha66, including plans to assassinate Castro. Veciana said his relationship withthe agency did not end until 1973, when Bishop paid him $253,000 as back pay forhis services.But Veciana’s most astounding claim is that during a visit to Dallas in lateAugust or early September 1963, he saw his CIA case officer in conversation witha man he later recognized as Lee Harvey Oswald.Although the House Select Committee on Assassinations failed to “credit”Veciana’s story of the Oswald-Bishop meeting, it nevertheless went to greatlengths to try to locate the mysterious Bishop, including sending an artist’ssketch of Bishop to US newspapers. The committee also scoured CIA files to tryto identify Bishop. Unsurprisingly, the agency denied ever assigning a caseofficer to Veciana.Veciana also told the committee that shortly after the assassination, Bishopcontacted him and reminded him that he had a relative working for Cubanintelligence living in Mexico. According to Veciana, Bishop wanted Veciana tooffer his relative a “large sum of money” to say that the relative and his wifemet Oswald during his Mexico City trip. Veciana said he agreed to this schemebut was unable to contact his relative.The House committee later developed information that Bishop may have been noneother than David Atlee Phillips, former chief of the Western HemisphereDivision’s Directorate of Operations in the CIA. Phillips denied being Bishopand a suddenly fearful Veciana agreed. However, after arranging a meetingbetween Veciana and Phillips, the committee staff reported it “suspected thatVeciana was lying when he denied that the retired CIA officer was Bishop.” Itsreport added, “Further, a former CIA case officer who was assigned fromSeptember 1960 to November 1962 to the JM/WAVE station in Miami told thecommittee that the retired officer [Phillips] had in fact used the alias,Maurice Bishop.”Though the controversy continues today, most JFK researchers believe Phillipsand Bishop were one and the same.David Atlee Phillips died of cancer on July 7, 1988. In an unpublished novelconcerning a CIA officer who lived in Mexico City, Phillips had his characterlament:I was one of those officers who handled Lee Harvey Oswald. . . . We gave him themission of killing Fidel Castro in Cuba. . . . I don’t know why he killedKennedy. But I do know he used precisely the plan we had devised against Castro.Thus the CIA did not anticipate the president’s assassination, but it wasresponsible for it. I share that guilt.A prime example of the interference with investigations into links betweenanti-Castro Cubans and the assassination came just days after Kennedy waskilled. The Chicago field office of the Secret Service reported to superiorsthat it had heard from an informant that a Chicago group “may have [had] aconnection with the JFK assassination.” The informant reported that on the daybefore the assassination, a Cuban militant named Homer S. Echevarria had statedthat he had “plenty of money” for an illegal arms deal and would proceed withthe plan “as soon as we take care of Kennedy.”The Secret Service checked on Echevarria and discovered he was an associate ofthe military director of the Cuban Student Directorate (the New Orleans chapterof the CSD was headed by Carlos Bringuier, who had squabbled with Oswald on thestreets of that city) and that the munitions deal was financed by “hoodlumelements . . . not restricted to Chicago.”Although the Secret Service wanted to pursue the matter, the FBI—which onNovember 29, 1963, President Johnson designated to control the assassinationinvestigation—“made clear that it wanted the Secret Service to terminate itsinvestigation” of the Echevarria report. The case was closed.One anti-Castro-Cuban-Oswald story that was not so easy to brush off is that ofCuban exile Silvia Odio. She and her sister Annie came from a distinguished andwealthy Cuban family. The sisters had been forced to flee Cuba after theirparents were imprisoned by the Castro government. Their father, who initiallyhad supported Castro’s revolution, had turned against the bearded leader and wasarrested for concealing a man named Reinaldo Gonzalez, who was involved in aplot to kill Castro. Interestingly, Gonzalez’s co-conspirator was AntonioVeciana, the leader of Alpha 66 who operated under the instructions of MauriceBishop.Shortly before moving to Dallas, Silvia Odio had joined with other anti-CastroCubans in Puerto Rico and formed Junta Revolucionaria (the Cuban RevolutionaryJunta) or JURE.One night in late September 1963—they believe it was the 26th or 27th—three mencame to Odio’s Dallas apartment. There were two Hispanics and one Caucasian,described as weary, unkempt, and unshaved.The leader of the trio identified himself as “Leopoldo” and introduced the otherHispanic man as “Angel” or “Angelo.” He introduced the American as “LeonOswald.”The men said they had just arrived from New Orleans, were members of JURE, andwere working with the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC). They knew her father’sunderground name and many details of anti-Castro activities in Cuba, includingrecent plots to kill Castro. They told Silvia Odio that they were trying toraise funds for anti-Castro operations and wanted her help in translatingsolicitation letters to American businessmen. Something about the men, however,made Odio uneasy and she sent them away after warning them that she did not wantto be involved in a campaign of violence. During their brief stay, her sisterAnnie also got a good look at the trio.Within forty-eight hours, “Leopoldo” called Silvia Odio and asked for herthoughts on their American companion. She said the man then made a series ofcomments, saying:Well, you know he’s a Marine, an ex-Marine, and an expert marksman. He would bea tremendous asset to anyone, except that you never know how to take him. . . .He’s kind of loco, kind of nuts. He could go any way. He could do anything—likegetting underground in Cuba, like killing Castro. . . . The American says weCubans don’t have any guts. He says we should have shot President Kennedy afterthe Bay of Pigs. He says we should do something like that.Apparently, that was all “Leopoldo” had to say, for he quickly hung up and Odionever heard from him again. She later told author Anthony Summers, “Immediately,I suspected there was some sort of scheme or plot.”Although the Odio sisters wrote of the incident to their father and told thestory to friends well before Kennedy’s assassination, they did not tellauthorities of the strange visitors. Both sisters were shocked and frightened tosee photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald since, then and now, they both believe himto be “Leon Oswald.”After the assassination, word of the Odio visit reached the FBI, whichinvestigated the matter for the Warren Commission. The Commission, havingalready accepted FBI and CIA evidence that Oswald was on his way to or in MexicoCity at the time of the Odio visit, stated, “While the FBI had not yet completedits investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, theCommission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs. Odio’s apartmentin September 1963.”No one seemed to even consider whether someone might have been posing as Oswald.The Odio story caused great problems with the Warren Commission Report. IfOswald was in Dallas, he couldn’t have been traveling by bus to Mexico at thesame time. And if the Oswald in Odio’s apartment was not the real Oswald, thenit is clear that someone was impersonating him with an eye toward implicatingOswald in the assassination. Small wonder the Commission decided to let thematter rest.[images/line.jpg]Oswald’s Girlfriend [Contents.html#rsec33]Recent revelations by Judyth Vary Baker may go a long way in untangling themorass of characters and agendas involving Lee Harvey Oswald in New Orleansduring the summer of 1963.Baker, who in 2013 was living outside the United States after claiming deaththreats, told her life story in the 2010 book Me & Lee. Although Baker’s storyhas suffered attacks from all sides, her story is nevertheless internallyconsistent and well supported by known facts and documentation.As a precocious teenager Baker vowed to find a cure for cancer after losing hergrandmother to that disease. Still in high school, she came to the attention ofmilitary and medical authorities for her work in cancer research as well as aproject on how to acquire magnesium from sea water. The magnesium projectbrought the attention of Florida leaders, including the powerful senator GeorgeSmathers, both a personal friend of President Kennedy’s and a staunch supporterof the anti-Castro Cubans. Smathers helped bring her cancer studies to theattention of Drs. Harold Diehl and Alton Ochsner, both high-ranking officers ofthe American Cancer Society.They were desperately looking for a cure for cancer because they knew that thepolio vaccines developed by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin in the 1950s had beenmade from monkey glands, which also carried a cancer-causing DNA virus calledSimian Virus (SV) 40. While the vaccines may have checked the spread of polio,the contamination brought on an epidemic of cancer, some not becoming apparentfor many years. Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, found in drugs from monkeyglands, is thought by some to be a forerunner of Acquired ImmunodeficiencySyndrome (AIDS).Baker said that in late April 1963 she arrived in New Orleans to continue hercancer research. She was enticed by promises of a scholarship to TulaneUniversity and the privilege of working with renowned cancer researcher Dr. MarySherman, director of the bone pathology laboratory at the Ochsner Clinic there.To Baker’s consternation, she was never given a scholarship or allowed to workin the clinic. Instead, she was put in touch with David Ferrie, who told her hewas running a clandestine but government-backed cancer lab trying to find acure. Ferrie’s apartment was filled with cages for white mice and an assistantknowledgeable in cancer research was needed. Judyth Baker fit the bill.But even before she could meet with Dr. Ochsner, Baker came across a young manin the post office who spoke to her in Russian. Having studied some Russian,Baker was instantly drawn to this new friend—Lee Harvey Oswald.During the ensuing weeks, Baker claimed to have developed a love for Lee,despite the fact that both were already married. This, of course, made theirrendezvous secretive and not likely to have been documented. This lack of proofhas caused much disbelief in her story. It was also convenient to the romancethat Oswald’s wife was in Texas and Baker’s husband was only home infrequently,as he worked on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.David Lewis was in the thick of the New Orleans scene in the summer of 1963. Hewas an acquaintance of Ferrie’s and Oswald’s as well as an employee of GuyBanister’s. His wife, Anna Lewis, said she and her husband once were introducedby Oswald to Mafia boss Carlos Marcello in his 500 Club. Several times theLewises met with Lee and Judyth. In a taped interview Anna Lewis was asked todescribe their relationship. “I would say they were lovers,” she responded. Sheapparently was not lying to support Judyth’s story, because judging by her othercomments, Anna Lewis obviously did not care for Baker.What is documented is that both Lee Oswald and Judyth Baker went to work at theReily Coffee Company on the same date—Friday, May 10, 1963. This was five daysbefore Baker’s twentieth birthday. Oswald was twenty-three. Only three daysbefore, both Lee and Judyth had met with Dr. Ochsner, a well-known supporter ofanti-Castro activities. Realizing from the conversation that Ochsner obviouslyhad known Oswald previously, Baker then knew their meeting in the post officehad not been an accident.Baker soon understood that both she and Lee were working for clandestine yetpowerful backers. She knew Oswald had connections to Carlos Marcello, a Dallasnightclub owner named Jack Rubenstein, and local businessman Clay Shaw, but shealso suspected ties to the CIA as well. Once when she asked Oswald about thesource of his money (other than his Reily paycheck), he put his finger to hislips and said, “I can’t tell you. But I can guarantee that the money isn’tcoming from Uncle Fidel.”Baker explained, “I gave up trying to follow the players, techniques, andmotives in Lee’s complex covert world.”Her days became increasingly harried. She covered for Oswald at the coffeecompany by clocking him out each day while he was at Ferrie’s apartment, runningerrands, and meeting with Guy Banister. After work she would go to Ferrie’sapartment to do research and write reports on their progress. She said she andLee also were tasked with trying to ferret out any Castro supporters from amongthe many Cubans employed at the Reily Coffee Company. She explained thatOswald’s distributing of pro-Castro literature was part of this same agenda.Due to his many roles, Oswald frequently was missing from his job. This wasconfirmed by Charles Le Blanc, the Reily employee who “broke Oswald in on thejob.” After the assassination, LeBlanc told the FBI, “Oswald was not attentiveto his job and wandered about the building considerably and was usually gonewhen he was needed.” He said when he asked Oswald where he had been, Oswaldwould just shrug his shoulders and say, “Just been around.”In his travels to and from the coffee company, Oswald would stop frequently atthe nearby Crescent City Garage, where, as will be described later, he was seenin the company of federal agents.Further support for Baker’s story comes from the fact that Oswald was fired fromhis job at the Reily Coffee Company on July 19, 1963. Three weeks later, Oswaldwas arrested for the street incident with Carlos Bringuier and his name appearedin the newspaper. That same day, Baker, who had accompanied Oswald to hismeeting with Bringuier, also was fired from Reily. The Cuban spy-hunt phase hadcome to an end but the cancer project continued.In Ferrie’s informal lab, Oswald would clean the mice cages while Baker wouldaccept new mice from Cuban couriers who brought them from a breeding laboratoryin a nearby house, test for the most virulent tumors in the injected mice, andthen grind up the tumors in a blender to produce what they called the “product,”which was delivered to Dr. Mary Sherman for analysis.Very soon, Baker began to realize their work was carrying them into the realm ofcancer-causing agents as biological weapons more than attempting to find a cure.She said she and Oswald as well as Dr. Sherman became concerned.Their fears were well founded, for in late August a “volunteer” inmate wasbrought from Louisiana’s Angola State Prison to the Jackson State MentalHospital in Jackson, Louisiana, where he was injected with the latest “product.”Baker’s story explains an incident in nearby Clinton, Louisiana, involvingOswald, Ferrie, and a man later identified as Clay Shaw, an incident that stillpuzzles assassination researchers. What would Shaw, Ferrie, and Oswald be doingin Clinton? One suggestion has been that the trio was somehow involved in theFBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO). It is now well established thatCOINTELPRO was a ruthless long-term bureau program Hoover designed to disruptand discredit political groups he opposed. The notorious wiretapping of Dr.Martin Luther King Jr. is just one example of this program.But Baker offered another explanation. So as not to draw attention to themselvesin the small town of Jackson, the Oswald group parked near the courthouse inClinton to await a phone call notifying them that the prisoner was on the way.Located about ninety miles northwest of New Orleans and twelve miles east ofJackson, Clinton was a small community of about 1,500 people in 1963. While thetown was larger than Jackson, it was still difficult to keep the townspeoplefrom knowing just about everything that went on there—especially if it involvedstrangers.In 1963, the civil rights program was gaining strength throughout the South.That summer would become known as “civil rights summer” and tiny Clinton was oneof the communities targeted for a black voter registration drive by the Congressof Racial Equality. Tensions in Clinton were high. Earlier in the summer,several blacks were arrested there simply for writing appeals to the mayor anddistrict attorney.One morning, between August 22 and September 17—a time when Oswald’s whereaboutsremain officially unaccounted for—a long line of blacks waited to undergo thethen-tedious process of registering to vote. Local police stood nearby, watchfulfor any breach of the peace. The incident that morning—pieced together fromseveral witnesses—began with the arrival of a large, black Cadillac carryingthree men. After the car parked near the registrar’s office, one of the men—aslightly built white man—got out and joined the line of blacks. Later, witnesseswere unanimous in identifying the man as Lee Harvey Oswald.The registrar, Henry Palmer, had more to go on than just looks. He laterrecounted, “I asked him for his identification and he pulled out a US Navy I.D.card. . . . I looked at the name on it and it was Lee H. Oswald with a NewOrleans address.” Palmer said Oswald told him he wanted to get a job at nearbyEast Louisiana State Hospital and thought he would have a better chance if hewas a registered voter. Oswald was told he had not lived in the area long enoughto qualify as a voter and, after thanking Palmer, he returned to the Cadillac.Baker explained that Oswald, becoming bored and very interested in the civilrights movement, made a bet that he could register to vote without the problemssome of the blacks faced.Meanwhile, Town Marshal John Manchester had approached the car, but left afterspeaking to the driver, whom he later described as “a big man, gray-haired, withruddy complexion.”New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison later attempted to prove that thedriver was Clay Shaw, the defendant in Garrison’s JFK assassination-plot trialin 1967. Many researchers argued that the driver was Guy Banister. Baker’sassertion that it was Shaw was given weight by Registrar Palmer, who in lateryears told this author that he had known Guy Banister in the Army and that theman driving the Cadillac in Clinton was definitely not Banister, thus providingstrong support to Garrison’s charge that the man was indeed Clay Shaw.The tragic outcome of this visit was that the prisoner eventually arrived at thehospital, was injected with the cancer agent, and died soon after. It was onlythen that Baker said she learned that the man she thought had volunteered tohelp find a cancer cure because he already was dying from the disease actuallywas a perfectly healthy Cuban prisoner chosen because he was approximately thesame size and weight as Castro. She finally saw the ultimate goal of thecancer-cure project—developing a cancer-causing agent for use on Cuba’s leader.Horrified, Baker left a note for Ochsner stating, “Injecting disease-causingmaterials into an unwitting subject who does not have a disease is unethical.”Her note set off a firestorm. Ferrie warned her, “He’s your enemy now. He toldme that you and Lee are expendable.”Realizing the gravity of her situation, Baker moved out of New Orleans andreturned to Florida to live with her husband, Robert Baker. Oswald made amysterious trip to Mexico. According to Baker, Oswald was to have passed thecancer-causing “product” to a contact in Mexico City for transmittal to Cuba.But the scheme fell apart, according to what Oswald was told, because ofHurricane Flora in late September 1963. It was among the deadliest hurricanes inhistory, causing more than 7,000 deaths. In its path across Cuba, it destroyedsafe houses, disrupted communications, and caused Oswald’s contact to miss therendezvous in Mexico.Still in communication via a complicated telephone arrangement through Ferrie,who had access to illegal and untraceable sports betting lines, Baker said, sheand Oswald began to realize that the attempt on Castro might have masked abigger, darker agenda—a move against President Kennedy.On Wednesday night, November 20, only two days before the assassination, Bakerhad her last phone conversation with Oswald. It was highly emotional as Bakerbegged him to get out of the plot. But Oswald said he was trying to foil theplot and added, “If I stay, there will be one less bullet fired at Kennedy.”Oswald also repeated the name David Atlee Phillips, saying this was the man hebelieved was organizing the assassination. It was Phillips, aka Maurice Bishop,seen meeting with Oswald by the CIA-backed anti-Castroite Antonio Veciana.Phillips also worked with David Morales in the JM/WAVE operation. Morales wasnamed by E. Howard Hunt in a 2007 deathbed statement as a major link between CIACovert Action Officer Cord Meyer and William Harvey, head of the ZR/RIFLECIA-Mafia assassination team, and the real shooters in the assassinationconspiracy.Following the assassination, Baker was shocked to witness the televised murderof Oswald by Jack Ruby, a man she had met in New Orleans through Lee Oswald. Shesoon received a phone call from David Ferrie advising her to become a “vanillagirl,” that is, to lay low, blend in, and forget about her career in science. Hesaid if she was lucky, she might live.Baker learned that Dr. Sherman had been murdered in July 1964 and that JackRuby, David Ferrie, and one of Ferrie’s associates had all died in early 1967under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the Garrison investigation.Baker took Ferrie’s advice. She did not speak of her experiences in New Orleansor her connection to Lee Oswald until December 1998, when she rented a copy ofOliver Stone’s film JFK. Her experiences all came flooding back. With herchildren grown and her husband now deceased, she decided to go public with herstory. Also, she said, “I realized Lee had been murdered by a friend [JackRuby]. . . . My eyes were opened to the corruption that rules our nation.” Bakercame to realize that her lover Lee Oswald was involved in intelligence work forthe US government, just as his mother always claimed, and had infiltrated agroup bent on assassinating the president but was set up as a patsy and murderedin public to protect the real assassins by silencing him.One of Baker’s staunchest supporters has been Florida advertising executiveEdward T. Haslam, a native of New Orleans and author of the 2007 book Dr. Mary’sMonkey, which documents the polio vaccine adulteration, the cancer lab, and thework by Drs. Sherman and Ochsner, David Ferrie, and Oswald. In his firstedition, Haslam wrote it would be vital to the story if a living witness couldbe found. He was astounded to learn of and meet Judyth Vary Baker. But thisbrought up a bizarre and unexplained circumstance.In 1972 while attending Tulane University in New Orleans, Haslam was invited toa party, the hostess of which was introduced as Judyth Vary Baker. This Bakergot Haslam off into the kitchen and began to question him about his interest inthe Kennedy assassination. Although, like many college students, Haslam hadspoken out about the many questions regarding the assassination, he feltuncomfortable about this questioning by Baker and, making excuses, he soon left,never to return to that apartment. Imagine his astonishment when in the year2000 he was introduced to Judyth Vary Baker in Florida and quickly realized thiswas not the same woman he had met in 1972 New Orleans. Adding to the mystery wasthe fact that the real Judyth Baker fled New Orleans in the fall of 1963 andnever returned. Who knew enough about the work in New Orleans to organize animpersonation of Judyth Baker in 1972? And to what purpose was someone scouringTulane University and its environs to learn who may have known about Oswald andhis activities there? This incidence lends strong support to the idea that avery dangerous secret was being preserved through cover-up and misdirection.Some people believe the adulteration of the polio vaccine and the subsequentrise in cancer deaths may even be a bigger secret than who was responsible forJFK’s death.[images/line.jpg]While many people, particularly those close to US intelligence and militarysources, still claim that Kennedy may have been killed on orders from Castro asa reprisal for the CIA-Mafia-Cuban plots against him, the evidence points moretoward the anti-Castro Cubans under the tutelage of the CIA.Former senator Robert Morgan, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee thatin 1976 looked into CIA-Mafia plots, continued to maintain that Kennedy broughtabout his own death. Differing from the conclusions of his own committee, Morganstated flatly, “There is no doubt in my mind that John Fitzgerald Kennedy wasassassinated by Fidel Castro, or someone under his influence, in retaliation forour efforts to assassinate him.”But one anti-Castro leader, John Martino, spelled out the assassination plan toa Texas business friend in 1975. In a startling telephone conversation with FredClaasen, repeated by author Anthony Summers, Martino admitted to serving as aCIA contract agent. He told Claasen:The anti-Castro people put Oswald together. Oswald didn’t know who he wasworking for—he was just ignorant of who was really putting him together. Oswaldwas to meet his contact at the Texas Theater. They were to meet Oswald in thetheater, and get him out of the country, then eliminate him. Oswald made amistake. . . . There was no way we could get to him. They had Ruby kill him.Most researchers today doubt Castro had a hand in Kennedy’s death. Even theaccused assassin couldn’t buy it. During interrogation on the Sunday morning hewas killed by Jack Ruby, Oswald was asked if his beliefs regarding Cuba played arole in the assassination. Asked by Secret Service inspector Thomas J. Kelley ifKennedy’s assassination would have any effect on the US policy toward Cuba,Oswald replied, “Will Cuba be better off with the President dead? Someone willtake his place, Lyndon Johnson, no doubt, and he will probably follow the samepolicy.”Also, while Castro eventually did learn of the plots against him, there is nofirm evidence that he knew of these schemes in time to have launched aretaliatory strike by November 1963. There seems no serious motive for Castro tohave Kennedy killed outside of simple revenge—and every motive against the idea.In a 1977 interview with Bill Moyers broadcast on CBS, Castro denied any thoughtof trying to kill the US president:It would have been absolute insanity by Cuba. . . . It would have been aprovocation. Needless to say, it would have been to run the risk that ourcountry would have been destroyed by the United States. Nobody who’s not insanecould have thought about [killing Kennedy in retaliation].The day after the assassination CIA director John McCone received a memo fromhis Mexico City station stating that Oswald had been in contact with ValeryKostikov, a KGB officer there thought to be an expert on assassination.Prophetically, the memo added, “If Oswald was part of a foreign conspiracy, hemight be killed before he could reveal it to US authorities.” This informationimmediately was passed to President Johnson, who probably knew better than tosubscribe to a foreign plot. However, here was the excuse to proclaim fear of aSoviet plot and World War III and to curtail any potentially dangerousinvestigations.Johnson had his aide Cliff Carter notify Dallas County district attorney HenryWade to not mention any conspiracy and he ordered all intelligence agents inMexico to stop investigating any leads involving conspiracy. This was theinitial step that blocked the plans to blame Castro for the assassination.But if the evidence of Castro’s involvement in the assassination is meager, itis more than made up for by the abundance of evidence of anti-Castro Cubaninvolvement, as we have seen in this chapter.And behind the anti-Castro Cubans always lurked the shadowy hands of USintelligence and the even darker specter of organized crime."},{"pageContent":"Mobsters [Contents.html#rch6]Immigrants to the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s, trapped bytheir inability to speak English, lack of education, and class and culturaldifferences, found themselves crammed into inner-city ghettos spawning amultitude of street gangs. They carried names like the Whyos, the Dead Rabbits,the Bowery Boys, the Tenth Avenue Gang, the Gas House Gang, and the MidnightTerrors. Despite their colorful names, these gangs were anything but funny.Young toughs would rob and beat their victims in broad daylight, with little tofear from the police—as long as they confined their illegal activities to theghetto and its cowed population.In the various ethnic communities some people had belonged to the secretsocieties of other countries—the Mafia of Sicily, the Camorra of Italy, and theTongs of China. They brought the learned terror and intimidation of thesesocieties to their new home, where it found fertile soil.As America entered the twentieth century, the city gangs were becoming moreadept at their profession and expanding operations to include gambling,prostitution, and lotteries. They also were the bankers for the poor, chargingexorbitant interest rates from those who could borrow money nowhere else.The Irish brought a new dimension of power to the gangs. Unhampered by alanguage barrier and experienced in politics in their homeland, the Irish gangsgained advantages by allying themselves with political figures. Initially it wasthe politicians who used the gangsters. Ballot boxes were stuffed, votersintimidated, and opposition rallies broken up. But as the gang leaders grew morewealthy, and thus more powerful, soon the politicians came seeking favors.Through the years that Tammany Hall controlled New York City, Irish gangstersprovided the enforcement muscle.Bootleggers and Boozers [Contents.html#rsec34]For more than fifty years prior to 1920, American groups such as the Women’sChristian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League had lobbied Congress andstate legislatures to prohibit the manufacture and sale of distilled spirits.Finally, with many male voters off serving in the military and with theemotional exhaustion and moral primness following World War I, their dreambecame reality. In December 1917, Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment tothe Constitution, prohibiting the sale of intoxicating beverages, and by January1919, the necessary thirty-six of the forty-eight states had ratified it.In October 1919—overriding the veto of President Woodrow Wilson—Congress passedthe Volstead Act, which created the government bureaucracy needed to enforce theEighteenth Amendment. At midnight January 16, 1920, Prohibition became the lawof the land.Less than an hour after midnight, six masked men drove a truck into a Chicagorailroad switchyard, broke into two freight cars, and made off with $100,000worth of whiskey marked FOR MEDICINAL USE ONLY. Bootleggers bought a quart ofquality Scotch at sea for $4, then diluted it into three quarts selling for asmuch as $40 a bottle.That was just the beginning of an era that witnessed rapid decay of publicmorality, disrespect for law, and the rise of a gigantic criminal empire thatremains with us today. In addition to the growing power of this criminal empire,Americans saw law-enforcement powers slowly shift from local officials to thenational government. New power bases arose, such as the fledgling Federal Bureauof Investigation, begun in 1909, and a variety of Prohibition agencies, whichwere to evolve into such modern forms as the Bureau of Narcotics and DangerousDrugs (forerunner of the Drug Enforcement Agency) and the Alcohol, Tobacco, andFirearms agency (now the Justice Department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, andFirearms and Explosives).Illegal booze was smuggled into the United States in every conceivable mannerand from every conceivable point—across the Mexican and Canadian borders andoffloaded from ships to small powerboats that moved out of remote bays almost atwill.One erstwhile honest businessman who turned to bootlegging may have been JosephP. Kennedy, patriarch of the Kennedy clan. Although no conclusive evidence ofKennedy’s bootlegging is available—his business papers are still kept lockedaway in Boston’s John F. Kennedy Library—it has been widely rumored that theelder Kennedy got started on the road to riches by importing illegal booze. Thisallegation is supported by the fact that as soon as Prohibition ended, Kennedyimmediately was in the Scotch, gin, and rum business through a firm he foundedcalled Somerset Importers.Unlike today’s War on Drugs, even Prohibition’s most ardent supporters wereforced to concede that it simply didn’t work. If enough people want a commodity,others will find a way to get it to them—for a price.The price of alcohol prohibition—the massive corruption of the political andlegal system, the enormous power wielded by the criminal gangs, and the deathsand maiming from toxic hooch and gangland wars—was too steep. On December 5,1933, Prohibition was repealed. After national Prohibition ended, each statecreated its own liquor authority, opening up new avenues for bribery andpayoffs.As America’s fortunes soared between 1910 and 1929, so did those of the gangs,particularly those with farsighted leadership. A Jewish gangster from New York,Arnold Rothstein, became an example of the successful underworld leader.Nicknamed “The Brain,” Rothstein grew from a small-time gambler into one of themost powerful men in the city. He reportedly even fixed the 1919 World Series.Though he initially refrained from bootlegging, Rothstein eventually became thelargest supplier of illegal booze in the East. He began to move in respectablecircles, rubbing elbows with city and state officials.Rothstein was considered a wealthy front man for New York’s real Mafia leaders,which by the late 1920s involved two large families run by Giuseppe Masseria andSalvatore Maranzano. These families were locked in a protracted blood feud knownas the Castellammorese War (from Maranzano’s Sicilian hometown of Castellammoredel Golfo).Eventually gangsters from both New York and Chicago were drawn into the war. By1931, the war was going against Masseria when one of his lieutenants, Charles“Lucky” Luciano (real name: Salvatore Lucania), decided to arrange a “peace” byhaving Masseria murdered on April 15, 1931, in a Coney Island restaurant.Luciano immediately called a meeting with Maranzano ending the war. Luciano wasnow the preeminent leader of the criminal mobs. Wisely, Luciano declined thetitle of capo di tutti capi (boss of all bosses). Instead he created acommission of bosses and organized the old Mafia families into a national crimesyndicate, finally realizing the dream of merging the criminal gangs.Luciano began to move control of crime away from the traditional Italian andSicilian families. New faces were beginning to show up in the crime syndicate.The Jewish math wizard Meyer Lansky, Legs Diamond, Dutch Schultz, and Benjamin“Bugsy” Siegel were among those slowly being admitted to policy meetings. ButLuciano was still the man in charge. After extensive investigation, Tennesseesenator Estes Kefauver wrote, “The Mafia is the cement that binds organizedcrime and the man who perfected the cement was Luciano.”Lucky Goes to War [Contents.html#rsec35]Next to Prohibition, one of the most far-reaching events in the history oforganized crime came during World War II when Lucky Luciano became partners withthe US government.Luciano never gave up his original means of making money—prostitution—and itproved his undoing.In 1936, under special New York County prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, Luciano wastried and convicted of compulsory prostitution, ending up in Clinton StatePrison at Dannemora in upstate New York. It appeared Luciano was safely putaway. But then came World War II.The war produced undreamed-of wealth for the mobs wherever they were. Thefriendly bootleggers of yesterday became the friendly black marketers of today,supplying nylons, new cars, gasoline coupons, tires, food ration stamps, andeven military commissions and discharges.It was unnecessary to counterfeit ration coupons. Gangsters simply obtained realones from corrupt officials within the Office of Price Administration, asemi-volunteer organization that counted among its young lawyers an aspiringpolitician from California, Richard M. Nixon. One man who dealt with the Officeof Price Administration and became rich in the automobile-tire business duringthe war was Charles G. “Bebe” Rebozo, who remained close friends with Nixonthrough the years.Toward the end of 1942, the first year of war for the United States, things werenot going well for the US Navy. In March of that year alone, twenty-fourAmerican ships had been sunk by German U-boats and on November 9, 1942, theformer French liner Normandie caught fire and rolled over in its North Rivermoorings in Manhattan while being refitted as a troop carrier. It was plainly anact of sabotage—and later was attributed to mobster Vito Genovese, who returnedto Italy during the war and supported dictator Benito Mussolini. Furthermore,naval intelligence was convinced that information about ship convoys was beingtransmitted to the Axis by longshoremen of German and Italian extraction.In a desperate attempt to compensate for years of neglect in the intelligencefield, US military officers decided to contact the mob for help. Navy SecretaryFrank Knox created a special intelligence unit for the Third Naval District,including the Port of New York, which handled nearly half of all US foreignshipping. This unit was headed by Lieutenant Commander Charles RadcliffeHaffenden, who quickly opened an unobtrusive office in Manhattan’s Astor Hotel,where he met with mob figures.The Navy appealed to Manhattan district attorney Thomas E. Dewey to put them intouch with Mafia leaders. A Dewey investigator, Murray Gurfein, contacted Mafiaboss Joseph “Socks” Lanza as a first step. Lanza immediately went to gangsterMeyer Lansky, who had helped guide Luciano in organizing the national crimesyndicate. Lansky, sensing an opportunity to increase his prestige with thesyndicate, met with Commander Haffenden and promised to get Luciano’s support.Years later, Lansky told biographers, “Sure, I’m the one who put Lucky and NavalIntelligence together. . . . The reason I cooperated was because of strongpersonal feelings. I wanted the Nazis beaten. . . . I was a Jew and I felt forthose Jews in Europe who were suffering. They were my brothers.”Although officially no deals were made with Lansky and Luciano—they supposedlycooperated out of sheer patriotism—soon Luciano was transferred from the“Siberia” of Dannemora to the more genial surroundings of Great Meadow Prisonnear Comstock, New York. The alliance proved effective.Union strikes and sabotage were practically nonexistent on the New York docksduring the war. And when US forces landed in Sicily, Mafia men were waiting toshow them the location of German positions and safe routes through minefields.During this final phase of the war, the Mafia-military cooperation—known asOperation Underworld—moved from the Navy to the Office of Strategic Services,forerunner of the CIA.On January 3, 1946, Dewey—by then governor of New York—forwarded to the statelegislature an executive clemency for Luciano that noted his “aid” to the wareffort. Luciano was freed from prison but promptly deported. He had neverbothered to become an American citizen. He sailed for Italy aboard the SS LauraKeene on February 3, 1946. Once ensconced in Italy, Luciano didn’t acceptretirement. He began to bring his formidable organizational abilities toworldwide crime. Later that year, he turned up in Havana, Cuba, where Lansky wasbusy consolidating the gambling and prostitution business. However, Americanauthorities warned the Cubans that medical supplies would be shut off if Lucianowas allowed to remain. He soon departed.Returning to Italy, Luciano began to organize an international narcoticssyndicate that remains in operation today.[images/line.jpg]Official awareness of organized crime dates back to a conference oflaw-enforcement officials called together by US attorney general J. HowardMcGrath in 1950. Officials from New Orleans, Dallas, and other cities testifiedto the brutal takeover of crime in their areas. One dissenter was Otto Kerner,the US attorney from Chicago, who maintained there was “no organized gambling inthe city of Chicago.” In 1973, Kerner was convicted of accepting $150,000 inbribes from horse-racing interests.One of the results of the 1950 conference was the creation of a Select SenateCommittee to probe organized crime under the sponsorship of senator EstesKefauver of Tennessee. The Kefauver Committee hearings lasted well into 1951 andprovided much more public knowledge about the national crime syndicate. WhileKerner and McGrath—along with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover—had maintained thatno crime syndicate existed, Kefauver and his committee provided the evidencethat it did. The committee found that organized, professional gambling andbook-making was widespread throughout the nation, that the narcotics industrywas a “highly organized crime,” and that the mob had infiltrated legitimatebusinesses ranging from advertising to transportation.It also showed the amount of official corruption the syndicate needed toflourish. The committee’s final report quoted a mobster named John Roselli, wholater became embroiled in the CIA-Mafia assassination schemes, saying, “The wireservice, the handbooks, the slot machines, and the other rackets which havethrived in the city of Chicago cannot operate without local corruption; if thehandbooks are open, the conclusion is inescapable that the police are being paidoff.”The Kefauver Committee also found that organized crime had spread from New Yorkand Chicago to new markets in places like Kansas City, New Orleans, and Dallas.After visiting New Orleans, the committee described it as “one of America’slargest concentrations of gambling houses.” One of these houses, the BeverlyClub, was found to be owned by Phil Kastel, Frank Costello, Jake Lansky (Meyer’sbrother), and a local Mafia leader, Carlos Marcello.Carlos Marcello [Contents.html#rsec36]Carlos Marcello (real name: Calogero Minacore) was born in 1910, the child ofSicilian parents living in Tunisia. That same year the family came to NewOrleans. At that time, the leader of the Mafia in New Orleans was CharlesMontranga.In 1922, Montranga was succeeded by one of his lieutenants, Sam Carolla. Carollabecame a bootlegger during Prohibition and consolidated the mob’s control of NewOrleans. In 1932, Carolla was convicted of shooting a federal agent and was sentto prison, where he continued to run his crime organization. That same year, NewYork mayor-elect Fiorello LaGuardia was clamping down on mob operations there,so Frank Costello moved his slot machine business to New Orleans with Carolla’spermission. Carolla even supplied a young associate to run the new gamblingoperation—Carlos Marcello.By 1947, Carolla and Marcello—with the aid of Costello and Meyer Lansky—hadexpanded their gambling operations to include a racetrack, wire service, andseveral plush casinos. That year, Carolla was deported to Sicily and despite twoillegal trips back, his control over New Orleans passed to Marcello.By 1963, the New Orleans Metropolitan Crime Commission estimated Marcello’sempire to range into the hundreds of millions of dollars, although Marcelloclaimed he made only about $1,600 a month as a tomato salesman. Much ofMarcello’s earnings had been put under the names of close relatives, hiding histrue worth.Marcello’s national crime contacts included Costello, Joe Civello of Dallas, SamYaras of Chicago, Mickey Cohen of Los Angeles, and Santos Trafficante Sr.,identified by the Kefauver Committee as Tampa’s leading mobster.Since the Kefauver Committee hearings, the US government had triedunsuccessfully to deport Marcello, who held only a Guatemalan passport obtainedallegedly by bribes.In the spring of 1961, Marcello found he was facing a new, and much tougher,government opponent than in the past. Entering the offices of the Immigrationand Naturalization Services in New Orleans for his quarterly appointment toreport as an alien, Marcello found himself handcuffed and driven to MoisantInternational Airport on direct orders from the new US attorney general, RobertF. Kennedy.He was flown 1,200 miles to Guatemala City, where he was dumped without luggageand with little cash. Forced to leave Guatemala because of the ensuing politicaluproar, Marcello somehow found his way back to Miami. House Select Committee onAssassinations chief counsel G. Robert Blakey claimed wiretaps showed Marcellowas flown back to the United States by a Dominican Republic Air Force plane;however, others claim he was flown back by pilot David Ferrie.Although still fighting deportation, Marcello managed to remain in the UnitedStates. But his Sicilian pride must have been greatly injured at Kennedy’sunceremonious actions. It was not long afterward that Marcello reportedly madethreats against the attorney general.Edward Becker, a Las Vegas promoter and corporate “investigator,” told the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations that he was present at a meeting in September1962, at Marcello’s estate just outside New Orleans, Churchill Farms. Beckersaid at the mention of Kennedy’s name, Marcello became angry and stated, “Don’tworry about that little Bobby son-of-a-bitch. He’s going to be taken care of.”According to Becker, Marcello then uttered a Sicilian curse:Livarsi na petra di la scarpa. (Take the stone out of my shoes.)Marcello described President Kennedy as a dog and Bobby Kennedy as the tail. Hethen gave a startlingly accurate prophesy of what was to come. He said the dogwill keep biting you if you only cut off its tail, but cut off the head and thedog will die, tail and all. The analogy was clear—with John Kennedy out of theway, his brother and attorney general Bobby Kennedy’s war on crime would come toan end.Becker said Marcello even had a plan. Marcello said he would use a “nut” for thejob, someone who could be manipulated so that the killing could not be tracedback to Marcello.The House Select Committee on Assassinations determined that there were manyconnections between Marcello and the JFK assassination—Marcello’s associate inDallas, Joe Civello, was close with Jack Ruby; a Marcello employee, DavidFerrie, was Oswald’s Civil Air Patrol leader and said to have been in contactwith Oswald during the summer of 1963; and Oswald’s uncle, Charles “Dutz”Murret, was acquainted with Marcello through his personal driver as well asother associates.It was just a few months after Marcello’s reported threat that Lee Harvey Oswaldarrived in New Orleans.In the early 1980s, Marcello was convicted in a sting known as Operation Brilab.While operating under cover, one of the FBI agents involved, Michael F. Wacks,had grown close to Marcello. Wacks said despite the distance in time, Marcellocould not hide his hatred for the Kennedys. “Historians don’t understand theloyalty mob bosses felt politicians owed them,” Wacks told this author. “Theythought they were on the same level. If they put someone into power and hedidn’t do their bidding, their solution was to take him out.”Debilitated by strokes as well as advancing Alzheimer’s, Marcello died in March1993.[images/line.jpg]Conflict over who would lead the American crime syndicate was resolved onOctober 25, 1957, when two gunmen shot Albert Anastasia out of a barber’s chairin New York. Earlier that year, Frank Costello, Luciano’s successor, was shotwhile entering his Manhattan apartment. He lived but was charged with taxevasion after a note was found on him listing receipts from the recently builtTropicana Hotel in developing Las Vegas. Costello retired from the rackets.Three weeks after Anastasia’s death, Vito Genovese called a mob conference, heldat the country estate of a Mafia lieutenant near the small town of Apalachin inupstate New York. On hand was a collection of almost every leader of the crimesyndicate. The purpose of the meeting, according to later testimony of some ofthose present, was to demand that Genovese be named “boss of all bosses” afterhe justified the attacks on Costello and Anastasia. One argument presented wasthat Anastasia had tried to move in on the Cuban gambling operations of SantosTrafficante Jr. of Florida.But before business could be settled, the police arrived, tipped off by an alertNew York State Police sergeant who had become suspicious of all the big blackcars with out-of-state license plates. Police roadblocks and searches ofsurrounding woods netted fifty-nine of the crime leaders, most of whom claimedthey had come to visit a sick friend. These included Joe Bonanno, JosephMagliocco, Carlo Gambino, Carmine Lombardozzi, John Bonventre, and JosephProfaci from New York; Anthony Magaddino from Niagara Falls; Vito Genovese,Gerardo Catena, Joseph Ida, and Frank Majuri from New Jersey; Frank DeSimonefrom California; Joe Civello from Dallas; and Trafficante. Carlos Marcello hadwisely sent a surrogate while others, such as Sam Giancana of Chicago, escaped.It was the first public look at organized crime since the Kefauver Committeehearings in the early 1950s. One of those aware of the serious threat posed bythe mob’s syndicate was young attorney Robert Kennedy, who after making anationwide fact-finding tour in 1956 and 1957 became most concerned with themob’s takeover of labor unions.On January 30, 1957, the US Senate unanimously created the Senate SelectCommittee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field—which becameknown as the McClellan Committee after its chairman, senator John L. McClellanof Arkansas. The committee’s chief counsel was Robert F. Kennedy. One member ofthe McClellan Committee was a young senator from Boston, John F. Kennedy.Kennedy later said his brother wanted him on the committee to keep it from beingoverloaded with conservative, antilabor people.Both Kennedys were highly active in the committee’s work, which first took onthe corrupt leader of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Dave Beck.Following the committee’s investigation, Beck was convicted in a state court oflarceny and then convicted of tax evasion in federal court. Beck went to prisonin 1957. President Gerald Ford granted him a full pardon in May 1975.With Beck gone, the presidency of the Teamsters Union went to Jimmy Hoffa. Evenbefore Hoffa could be brought before the McClellan Committee, he was indictedfor attempting to bribe commission attorney John Cye Cheasty.At his trial, the FBI showed a film of the men conversing and Hoffa beingarrested right after the money was exchanged. However, the jury of eight blacksand four whites was more impressed with Hoffa’s defense attorney, Edward BennettWilliams (owner of the Washington Redskins), as well as World HeavyweightChampion boxer Joe Louis, who embraced Hoffa while visiting the court.Hoffa went free to testify before the McClellan Committee. But Hoffa said he hada faulty memory when it came to most questions concerning his association withunderworld characters, such as Paul Dorfman. Dorfman was described by theMcClellan Committee as “an associate of Chicago mobsters and the head of a localof the Waste Material Handlers Union.” Dorfman also was connected to a youngJack Ruby, the man who silenced Lee Harvey Oswald.Dorfman’s stepson, Allen Dorfman, was to play a major role in Hoffa loans to theunderworld using the Teamsters’ Central States Health and Welfare Fund as wellas the Pension Fund. Today these are collectively known as the Central StatesFunds.In 1951, Hoffa persuaded the welfare fund’s two trustees—one of whom was Hoffa’ssuccessor, Frank Fitzsimmons—to place the fund with a newly formed branch ofUnion Casualty Agency. Union Casualty was owned by Paul Dorfman’s stepson,Allen, and the elder Dorfman’s wife, Rose.Later Hoffa also sent the Central States Pension Fund to the Dorfman-controlledagency. These two funds made up 90 percent of the company’s contracts, accordingto author Dan Moldea.Veteran mob observers have established the close ties between Hoffa and twoother underworld chieftains—Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante Jr.Santos Trafficante and Cuba [Contents.html#rsec37]During the mid-1950s, with gunfire punctuating internal mob leadership disputesin New York and various government panels revealing the extent of organizedcrime in the United States, crime bosses began to look south for relief.As early as 1933, the mob’s financial wizard, Meyer Lansky, had obtainedgambling concessions in Cuba, located just ninety miles off the Florida coast.Lansky had originally visited Cuba seeking molasses to make rum but discovered asuitable political climate for gambling operations. Befriending theself-proclaimed dictator of Cuba, Fulgencio Batista, Lansky soon opened severalcasinos. But World War II brought a halt to his plans for turning the islandinto a haven for gamblers. There simply weren’t enough planes and boatsavailable to make the project profitable.In 1944, the Cuban economy was sagging and Batista was forced to makeconcessions to his political opponents, which included procommunists. Accordingto investigative reporter Howard Kohn, the Office of Naval Intelligence—alreadyin contact with Lucky Luciano through Lansky—asked Lansky to pressure Batistainto stepping down. On Lansky’s urging, Batista called an election, wasdefeated, and left Cuba for an eight-year exile in Florida.On March 10, 1952, Batista returned to Cuba and seized power in a bloodlessmilitary coup. Reportedly, it was large amounts of money Lansky placed innumbered Swiss bank accounts that convinced Cuban President Carlos Prio Socarrasnot to resist Batista’s comeback.Under Lansky’s manipulation, Batista’s government agreed to match investments inCuba dollar for dollar plus grant a gambling license to any establishment worthmore than $1 million. Soon the island’s economy was booming as hotels andcasinos were quickly built. Lansky built the Hotel Nacional, whose pit boss washis brother, Jake. He and other associates had interest in the Sevilla Biltmoreand the Havana Hilton. Lansky himself built the $14 million Hotel HavanaRiviera, which was run by Dino and Eddie Cellini, organized-crime figures fromOhio.But Lansky, a Jew, still was not considered an official member of the ItalianMafia–dominated American crime syndicate. Organized-crime authority G. RobertBlakey wrote, “The undisputed Mafia gambling boss in Havana was SantosTrafficante, Jr.”When Trafficante Sr. died in 1954, his family crime business—mostly narcoticstrafficking and gambling—went to his namesake. By the late 1950s, TrafficanteJr. was well situated in Cuba, owning substantial interest in the Sans Souci, arenowned nightspot partly managed by a Trafficante associate, John Roselli,later a central figure in the CIA-Mafia plots against Castro.Both Trafficante and Lansky also were part owners of the Tropicana Casino inHavana, which was managed by former Dallas gambler Lewis McWillie, the “idol” ofJack Ruby.In Cuba, Meyer Lansky and associate Bugsy Siegel used the same tactics they hadused successfully in 1945 when they turned a dusty parcel of Nevada desert intothe Las Vegas strip—flying in high rollers to stay at their hotel-casinos. Inreviewing the Havana operations during those years, Blakey wrote, “Havana, inshort, was a full-service vice capital, owned and operated by the Mob.”Other men who had gambling interests in Cuba during this time were connected toTeamster boss Jimmy Hoffa. Two New York underworld figures allied with the TommyLucchese family, Salvatore Granello and James Plumeri, were part owners of aHavana racetrack and a large casino. Granello and Plumeri also helped Teamsterofficials get Miami Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Teamstersstarted, according to Dan Moldea, author of The Hoffa Wars. Moldea also wrotethat at the time Granello and Plumeri were splitting kickbacks with Hoffa onloans made through the Central States Pension Fund.One high-placed guest in Cuba at the time was Congressman Richard Nixon, whomade frequent trips to the island, visiting both President Batista and thecasinos. According to Nixon biographer Earl Mazo, Nixon visited Cuba as early as1940 to consider “the possibilities of establishing law or business connectionsin Havana.”But the glamorous nightlife of Havana came to an abrupt end on New Year’s Day1959, when Fidel Castro entered the city and proclaimed a new Cuban revolution.Both Batista and Lansky fled Cuba that same day. Lansky later lamented that hecaught one of the last planes leaving Havana and was forced to leave behind $17million in cash that had been earmarked for his various partners via Swiss bankaccounts.Jake Lansky, left behind to hold together his brother’s gambling and narcoticsoperations, was jailed by Castro along with Santos Trafficante. Castro loudlyproclaimed, “I’m going to run all these fascist mobsters, all these Americangangsters, out of Cuba. I’m going to nationalize everything. Cuba for Cubans!”By 1960, Castro had made good on his threat. He had deported all syndicatemembers, closed the whorehouses and casinos, and shut down the drug labs.Both the crime syndicate and some American government officials were appalled atthis turn of events. The CIA particularly wanted something done since, accordingto agency sources quoted by journalist Howard Kohn, the agency had used theunderworld’s Havana casinos to hide payments to the crime figures it sometimesemployed. Thus the idea of invading Cuba may have been born. A murky alliancedeveloped between the CIA, the crime syndicate, the US military, and anti-CastroCuban exiles, and this alliance produced the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion.Four ex–casino bosses—including Hoffa associates Salvatore Granello and JamesPlumeri—even supplied the CIA with intelligence reports gathered from trustedCuban contacts.Along with the plans to invade Cuba, there were concurrent schemes toassassinate Castro. Involved in these plots were Trafficante, Frank Sturgis,Robert Maheu (the ex-FBI man who was liaison between the CIA and the Mafia andlater became manager of the Howard Hughes empire), and two Mafia chiefs, JohnRoselli and Sam “Momo” Giancana.With the failure of the invasion, the mob joined with the CIA, the military, andthe Cuban exiles in placing the blame squarely on President John F. Kennedy.Although mob gambling activity quickly shifted to Las Vegas and the Bahamas,crime leaders did not forget who had cost them their Havana “vice capital.”According to evidence gathered by House Select Committee on Assassinations,Trafficante was in touch with a wealthy Cuban exile living in Miami named JoseAleman. Trafficante had offered to arrange a million-dollar loan for Aleman fromthe Teamsters Union and had “already been cleared by Jimmy Hoffa himself.”Aleman said he met with Trafficante at Miami’s Scott-Bryant Hotel in September1962, and the talk turned to Hoffa. According to Aleman, Trafficante brought theconversation around to President Kennedy, saying, “Mark my words, this manKennedy is in trouble and he will get what is coming to him.”Aleman said when he disagreed, saying Kennedy was doing a good job and probablywould be reelected, Trafficante replied, “You don’t understand me. Kennedy’s notgoing to make it to the election. He’s going to be hit.” Later Aleman saidTrafficante “made it clear” he was not guessing and even gave “the distinctimpression that Hoffa was to be principally involved in the elimination ofKennedy.”Unknown to Trafficante, Aleman was an informant for the FBI at the time of thisalleged conversation. He promptly reported what he had heard to the bureau butsaid FBI officials would not listen or take him seriously. In 1978, long afterJFK’s successful assassination when Aleman testified before the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations, his story became vague. He said perhaps Trafficantemeant Kennedy was going to be “hit” by a lot of Republican votes in 1964. Alemanalso admitted he was “very much concerned about my safety.”[images/line.jpg]Jimmy Hoffa survived the McClellan Committee hearings. But it was the start of apersonal war between two of the nation’s most powerful men—Bobby Kennedy and theTeamster leader.The War on Hoffa [Contents.html#rsec38]James Riddle Hoffa was born on February 14, 1913, in Brazil, Indiana. After thedeath of his father when he was seven, young Hoffa moved to Detroit with hismother, brother, and two sisters.By 1932, Hoffa was already involved in the union movement. Angered over low payand working conditions at the Kroger Food Company, Hoffa helped organize a workstoppage. After several days of negotiation, the company signed a one-pagecontract. It was the start of a one-company union and was affiliated with theAmerican Federation of Labor. By the mid-1930s, Hoffa’s fledgling union wasabsorbed by bigger organizations. After being fired by Kroger, he joined DetroitTeamsters Joint Council 43 as an organizer and negotiator.In the early 1930s, Hoffa had a love affair with Sylvia Pigano, a woman withfamily connections to organized-crime figures. This was Hoffa’s introduction tothe underworld, which over the years became an invaluable source of support.From that point on Hoffa’s rise to the presidency of the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters continued unabated. He walked a thin line, maintainingcontacts with mobsters on one hand and presenting the image of a respectablelabor leader on the other.In 1957, fresh from his victory in exposing Teamster president Dave Beck’sembezzlement of union money, McClellan Committee chief counsel Robert Kennedyturned his sights on Beck’s successor, Jimmy Hoffa. After the committeehearings, Hoffa was acquitted on charges of wiretapping and perjury. He wasliving a charmed life, but his hatred for Kennedy was increasing.And the feeling was mutual. Robert Kennedy voiced concern over blackmail byorganized crime. If the mob so desired, it could have pressured Hoffa intocalling a nationwide Teamsters strike that could have disrupted the entirecountry. For the Kennedys, this was an intolerable situation.When the election year of 1960 arrived, Hoffa knew which side he had to be on.He and the Teamsters threw their support behind Richard Nixon. In fact, EdwardPartin, a Louisiana Teamster official and later a government informant, revealedthat Hoffa met with Carlos Marcello to raise money for Nixon.But money wasn’t enough. Nixon lost and Robert Kennedy became attorney general.After the election, Hoffa was quoted as saying, “Nobody had to tell me that hewas really going to go after my scalp now.”In 1958, US attorney general William P. Rogers had formed a special group onorganized crime to investigate Vito Genevese’s Appalachian meeting of mobbosses. Following that precedent, Attorney General Kennedy organized a specialunit within the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section to investigate theTeamsters Union. Headed by Walter Sheridan, who had been an investigator for theMcClellan Committee, the unit became known as the “Get Hoffa Squad.” The squadmanaged to bring 201 indictments and 126 convictions against Teamster officials.On May 18, 1962, Hoffa was indicted for receiving $1 million in illegal paymentsthrough the Test Fleet Corporation, a trucking company set up under his wife’sname. His trial ended in a hung jury, but Hoffa was indicted along with fiveothers for jury tampering on May 9, 1963. On June 4, 1963, Hoffa was indictedfor fraudulently obtaining $20 million in loans from the Teamsters’ CentralStates Pension Fund.Earlier, in September 1962—about the same time that Marcello and Trafficante hadhinted that President Kennedy was going to be assassinated—Ed Partin, theTeamster official–turned–informant, went to Louisiana law-enforcement officialsabout a threat by Hoffa. Partin believed that Hoffa thought Partin was closelyassociated with Marcello since he lived in Louisiana and spoke openly with him.Visiting in Hoffa’s Washington office in August 1962, Partin said Hoffa begantalking about plans to kill Robert Kennedy. Thinking out loud, Hoffa discussedtwo schemes. One involved firebombing Hickory Hill, Kennedy’s Virginia estate.The second involved shooting Kennedy with a rifle while he rode in an open car.Partin’s story was passed along to Kennedy aides, who were highly skepticaluntil an FBI lie detector test indicated Partin was telling the truth and hadactually obtained explosives to deliver to Hoffa.It was in the middle of Hoffa’s jury-tampering case that President Kennedy wasshot in Dallas. Upon learning that the flags were flying at half-mast atTeamster headquarters in Washington, Hoffa admonished officials there, shouting,“Why the hell did you do that for him? Who the hell is he?” On the day Rubymurdered Oswald, Hoffa told a Nashville reporter, “Bobby Kennedy is just anotherlawyer now.”In the jury-tampering and the fraudulent-loan cases Hoffa was convicted, fined,and imprisoned. He received executive clemency from President Richard Nixon onDecember 23, 1971, without the customary consultation with the sentencing judge.However, the clemency contained a provision prohibiting Hoffa from seekingoffice in the union. Hoffa filed suit to have the restriction nullified andbegan making overtures to Teamster rank and file. Ironically, he pledged that ifelected Teamster president in 1976, he would purge the union of all mobinfluence.On July 30, 1975, Hoffa was to meet Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano, a New JerseyTeamster official and reputed member of the crime syndicate. Hoffa disappearedfrom a Detroit restaurant parking lot and was finally declared dead in 1982. Tothis date, neither his body nor his killer has been found.[images/line.jpg]One of the biggest boosts to Robert Kennedy’s anticrime campaign began in June1962, when an underworld tough serving a prison term in Atlanta for narcoticsmurdered a fellow inmate with an iron pipe. The convict’s name was JosephValachi and he killed the man, believing him to be an assassin sent by hislongtime boss and cellmate, Vito Genovese. Genovese had slipped back into theUnited States after World War II to resume his narcotics operations.Imprisoned, Genovese had heard rumors—apparently false—that Valachi wascooperating with authorities and had given his veteran soldier the “kiss ofdeath.” Soon after, there were three attempts on Valachi’s life. Valachi didn’twant to wait for the fourth. So, believing a man in the prison courtyard was aGenovese killer, Valachi beat him to death. He picked the wrong man.With both the government and the mob seeking his life, Valachi decided he hadnothing to lose by cooperating with authorities. Over the next year, he providedfederal agents with a bonanza of information on the national crime organizationknown variously as the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (Our Thing), the Outfit, the Arm,the Syndicate, and so on.On September 25, 1963, Valachi took his story to the public, testifying beforeMcClellan’s Senate committee. He presented a wealth of detail about theorganization of the mob, its codes, rules, and regulations, and its mostimportant members, including those who sat on the “Commissione,” the board ofdirectors.Valachi’s testimony was a great embarrassment to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover,who it was later learned was meeting with mob bosses at the time. Theserevelations forced Hoover to grudgingly admit that such a thing as a crimesyndicate must exist.In his ever-increasing war against organized crime, Kennedy made use of theTreasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to go after mob members. John H.Davis, a Kennedy relative and author of The Kennedys, wrote, “Given another fiveyears in office, the Kennedys could conceivably have exterminated the CosaNostra entirely, or at least crippled it beyond repair.”Crime bosses wanted something done about the Kennedys, especially since theyfelt double-crossed by the two brothers.After all, the connections between crime and the Kennedys reportedly went back along way. In 1927, a shipment of bootleg whiskey on its way from Ireland toBoston was hijacked in southern New England. Almost the entire guard was killedin the resulting shootout. The hijackers were part of the Luciano-Lansky mob,and it was rumored that Joseph P. Kennedy was involved in the shipment. Kennedyreputedly lost a fortune on the deal and was besieged by widows of the guardsseeking financial assistance. Lansky later told biographers he was convincedthat Kennedy held a grudge against him personally from that time on and, infact, had passed the hostility on to his sons.But the crime contacts didn’t stop with Prohibition. According to crime authorOvid Damaris, Kennedy would likely have lost the state of Illinois—and possiblythe 1960 presidential election—except for overlarge voting in Cook County, homeof Chicago mayor Richard Daley. Following the election, Illinois Republicansmade an unofficial check of 699 paper ballot precincts in Cook County and turnedup enough irregular votes to shift the victory to Richard Nixon. However,demands for an official recount were blocked by Daley’s political machine. Andbehind that machine was the real power in Chicago at that time—Sam Giancana.Momo and His Girlfriends [Contents.html#rsec39]Sam Giancana (real name: Momo Salvatore Guingano) was born May 24, 1908, to poorSicilian immigrants living in Chicago. He grew up in the ghettos and wasstreetwise at an early age.A member of a gang called the 42s, Giancana was first convicted of car theft in1925. Before he was twenty, he was arrested in connection with three murders,including the slaying of Octavious Granady, a black man who sought election as acommitteeman.In 1932, Giancana came to the attention of Paul “The Waiter” Ricca (real name:Felice DeLucia), who worked for the notorious Genna brothers. Giancana becamethe personal driver for Ricca, who took over the Chicago syndicate after thesuicide of Frank Nitti in 1943. In 1944, Ricca went to prison for extortion andAnthony Accardo took over as Chicago’s syndicate boss. Giancana became hischauffeur. Giancana helped Accardo consolidate the rackets and gamblingoperations in Chicago. In 1957, Giancana was one of those who escaped from VitoGenevese’s ill-fated Appalachian meeting.In 1960, when Accardo retired after an income tax–evasion indictment, Giancanatook over the syndicate. By 1963, Giancana had been arrested sixty times and hadserved time for burglary, auto theft, and moonshining. He also was one of thewealthiest and most powerful men in Chicago and in the syndicate.After the death of his wife, Angeline, in 1954, Giancana became well-known as aladies’ man. While visiting Las Vegas in 1960, Giancana met Phyllis McGuire, theyoungest of the McGuire Sisters singing group. According to G. Robert Blakey,chief counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, McGuire had runup gambling debts of more than $100,000. Giancana—who along with Accardosecretly owned interest in the Desert Inn and the Stardust casinos in Las Vegasalthough both were nominally owned by Morris “Moe” Dalitz—made good McGuire’sdebt. Soon afterward, Giancana made his Las Vegas headquarters at the nearbyGreen Gables Ranch, leased by McGuire.During the 1960 election, Giancana and other mob leaders apparently thought theyhad bought some relief from growing government awareness and prosecution of thesyndicate, especially considering the close ties between FBI director Hoover,who continued to deny the existence of the Mafia, and mob figures such as RoyCohn and Frank Costello.In addition to meeting mob leader Joseph Bonanno in the winter of 1959, Kennedyreportedly received campaign contributions from the syndicate channeled to hisfather by singer Frank Sinatra. Yet another conduit for these funds may havebeen a woman with connections to both Kennedy and Giancana. Ironically, evidenceof these contributions to Kennedy were picked up by FBI phone taps that werepart of an electronic surveillance program initiated by Attorney General RobertKennedy’s war on crime.Giancana believed he had a strong hold on Kennedy in the form of a beautifuldark-eyed brunette named Judith Exner. Going then as Judy Campbell, Exner saidshe was introduced to John F. Kennedy on February 7, 1960, by Frank Sinatra,whom she had been dating. In her 1977 book, My Story, she wrote that both JohnKennedy and his brother Edward were sitting with Sinatra in the lounge of theSands Hotel in Las Vegas. She said she and John Kennedy met again a month later,this time alone and in the Plaza Hotel in New York where, according to Exner,they shared a bed.From that point on, Kennedy saw Exner regularly. The pair exchanged telephonecalls frequently, including some to the White House, which were noted by theFBI. Why the FBI? The bureau had been monitoring Exner’s activities because ofthe other man in her life—Chicago mob boss Giancana. Exner claimed she wasintroduced to Giancana, again by Sinatra, a month after she had become Kennedy’slover. When Giancana discovered she was seeing the Democratic presidentialcandidate, he took an immediate and continuing interest in her. Soon Giancanawas bedding the paramour of the soon-to-be president.In later years, Exner said, “I feel like I was set up to be the courier. I was aperfect choice because I could come and go without notice, and if noticed, noone would’ve believed it anyway.”What passed between Kennedy and Giancana in this extraordinary triangle is notknown, but in 1988, Exner revealed that she had acted as a courier carryingsealed envelopes for the two men on at least ten occasions. Citing ill health,Exner said she wanted to set the record straight. She said she did not tellabout the envelopes during 1975 testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committeebecause she feared for her life. She also claimed that she never opened theenvelopes or knew their contents. Most of her courier activities took placeduring the tough 1960 campaign and Exner speculated that her actions may havebeen connected with attempts to influence the critical West Virginia Democraticprimary.Once, after being questioned by FBI agents, Exner complained to Kennedy, who bythen was president. She claimed Kennedy assured her, “Don’t worry. They won’t doanything to you. And don’t worry about Sam. You know he works for us.”Kennedy continued to see Exner until a meeting with J. Edgar Hoover on March 22,1962. On that date Hoover revealed to the president the extent of Exner’s tieswith organized crime and the obvious fact that he knew about Kennedy’s liaisonwith her. Shortly after Hoover left the White House, there was one more call toJudith Exner. No more were ever logged. Kennedy also broke off his friendshipwith Sinatra, perhaps suspecting that the singer had set him up. Exner died ofcancer in 1999.But the worst was yet to come. Although still seeing Exner, Giancana becamesuspicious that Phyllis McGuire was seeing comedian Dan Rowan. Giancana askedhis contact with the CIA, Robert Maheu, to place a wiretap on Rowan’s telephone,but a maid discovered the tap and told Rowan, who brought it to the attention ofthe federal government. The Justice Department initiated proceedings againstMaheu for illegal wiretapping.In May 1962, a month after the Kennedy-Hoover meeting apparently ended thepresident’s relationship with Exner, CIA officials asked Robert Kennedy not toprosecute Maheu for fear that Giancana’s role in the incident would becomeknown. They reminded Kennedy that Giancana had played a role in the clandestineeffort against Castro’s government.Thinking the plots against Castro had been stopped back in 1961, Robert Kennedywas adamant about pressing charges. Then on May 7, CIA general counsel LawrenceHouston finally told Kennedy the whole ugly truth—that the agency had contractedwith Giancana and John Roselli to murder Fidel Castro. According to Houston,Kennedy fixed him with a cold look and said, “I trust that if you ever try to dobusiness with organized crime again—with gangsters—you will let the attorneygeneral know.”From that moment on, both Kennedys must have feared what Sam Giancana mightreveal if he chose—the CIA-Mafia murder plots and Giancana’s girl in bed withthe president. However, this fear did not stop the younger Kennedy fromprosecuting his war against targeted Mafia big shots, including Giancana.The FBI haunted Giancana day and night, watching his home and trailing his car.It was most effective. Crime associates wouldn’t come near and Giancana couldn’tgo where he pleased. He was isolated.In June 1963, Giancana caused chins to drop throughout the underworld bybecoming the first mobster ever to go to court seeking an injunction against FBIsurveillance. Gaining the injunction required Giancana to swear in court that hewas an honest businessman, which in turn would expose him to governmentcross-examination—an unprecedented hazard for a crime boss. Giancana must havefelt confident that the government would not question him too closely. And hewas right. To a stunned courtroom, the US attorney announced that the governmentwaived the right to cross-examination. The decision not to question Giancana hadcome straight from the attorney general.But his luck did not hold. Following Kennedy’s assassination, Giancana wasdeposed as a Mafia boss and went into exile in Mexico. However, the Mexicanauthorities arrested and deported Giancana back to the United States inmid-1974. Back in Chicago, he became a witness against organized crime. On June19, 1975, just before he was to testify to a Senate committee about CIA andMafia assassination plots, his police protection was suddenly called away whilesomeone slipped into his home and shot him in the back, rolled the body over,and shot him six times in the face and throat, a time-honored underworld warningagainst stool pigeons.Back in 1963, even when the opportunity to get Giancana was dropped, the KennedyJustice Department’s all-out war against the underworld continued. The top crimebosses were incensed. Hadn’t they contributed to Kennedy’s election? Hadn’t theyhelped steal critical votes? Hadn’t Kennedy dabbled with one of their women? Itundoubtedly looked like double-cross to the mob chieftains. And in theunderworld the only solution for a double-crosser is elimination—a “hit.”[images/line.jpg]On November 22, 1963, Attorney General Kennedy met with about forty of hisOrganized Crime and Racketeering Section staff. They had been meeting regularlyfor the past two and a half years.One of the young crime busters was G. Robert Blakey, who years later wouldbecome chief counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, created toinvestigate the murders of John and Robert Kennedy.Just before they broke for lunch, the last topic of discussion was Sam Giancanaand political corruption in Chicago. The attorney general had just finishedlunch at his McLean, Virginia, home when J. Edgar Hoover called to inform him,“The president’s been shot.” Hoover went on to give a fairly full account of LeeHarvey Oswald and his background at a time when the Dallas authorities were noteven certain of their suspect’s identity.Kennedy never met with the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section again. WithJohn F. Kennedy’s death, the war on crime was lost. Organized crime wasecstatic, but on FBI wiretaps, older and wiser mob leaders urged caution inspeaking about the assassination. One was overheard explaining, “Police spieswill be watching carefully to see what we . . . think and say about this.” Suchcaution was certainly justified. In the years since the assassination, more andmore attention has been drawn to the mob as one of the most likely suspects.Beginning with Jack Ruby right on through to David Ferrie and Jim Braden, crimefigures keep cropping up throughout the assassination case. There is no questionthat organized crime had the means, motive, and the opportunity to murder thepresident. But could the crime bosses have effectively covered their trackswithout the help of federal government officials?It now appears that the vocal wishes of the crime bosses to eliminate theKennedys were echoed by certain powerful men in government, finance, andcorporate business. In the subtitle of his book The Plot to Kill the President,G. Robert Blakey stated bluntly, “Organized Crime Assassinated J.F.K.” Blakeyonce told this author:One reason no one realized organized crime’s involvement [for many years] wasthat people never saw before . . . what was going on in Cuba. They failed to seethe significance of men like [mobster and “mentor” to Jack Ruby] Lewis McWillieand Russell Matthews [a Dallas gambler friend of Ruby’s who was best man at thewedding of “babushka lady” Beverly Oliver and gangster George McGann] becausethey did not understand these men’s connections.Asked if the fact that organized crime has been connected with the assassinationonly in recent years might suggest some control within the government on thepart of the mob, Blakey replied, “That’s conceivable. . . . I would find thattroubling, but no more so than the fact that they killed the man and got awaywith it.”Following his brother’s death, Robert Kennedy appeared to lose interest inprosecuting the mob and the Justice Department staff followed suit. While theremust have been motivation to protect his brother’s loving-husband image, thecooling of the attorney general’s passion for fighting the mob likely was duemore to the potential revelations of CIA-Mafia assassination plots.In fighting what the Kennedys had perceived as a great internal evil, they hadonce again found themselves confronted by the CIA."},{"pageContent":"Agents [Contents.html#rch7]Since the first conflicts of man, there has been a need for intelligence, orinformation on the activities and purposes of a perceived enemy. In modernAmerica the growth of myriad intelligence organizations over the years hasspawned an intelligence industry. Under acronyms such as CIA, DIA, NSA, ONI,NRO, AFOSI, DEA, and NGA, these intelligence power bases have grown far beyondtheir original charters. Today many thoughtful persons are concerned that thesedisparate agencies, with the exception of the military, are now bundled togetherwithin the Department of Homeland Security.The most publicized of these is the Central Intelligence Agency, whose historyreveals a government organization that does much more than merely collect andinterpret intelligence. In less than ten years after its creation in 1947, thiscoordinating agency grew to oversee military operations, destabilization effortsin foreign countries, and the assassination of national leaders—aided by anunholy alliance with organized crime.At the end of World War II, information on a wide variety of issues andactivities was being handled by as many as a dozen various intelligenceorganizations, including those within the military. President Harry S. Trumanand others perceived a need for a coordinating intelligence unit. This need wasfurther reinforced by the Congressional Joint Committee on the Pearl HarborAttack, which concluded that the fragmentation of US intelligence prior to 1941resulted in the Japanese taking this nation by surprise. The committeerecommended a unified intelligence service. Creating such a hybrid would not beeasy. None of the existing intelligence units wanted to relinquish power orauthority.During World War II, one of the organizations that proved most effective againstthe Axis powers was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), headed by thecolorful General William “Wild Bill” Donovan. The OSS not only gathered aremarkable amount of information on the enemy, but also engaged in variouscovert activities. It was a rough-and-tumble wartime operation that provided thefactual background for many a fictional spy novel and movie.The OSS was closed down at the end of the war, and on January 22, 1946, justfour months later, President Truman signed a directive creating the NationalIntelligence Authority (NIA), composed of the secretaries of state, war, andnavy as well as the president’s personal representative. The operating arm ofthe NIA was the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), made up of veteranintelligence officers from the participating departments. These men were managedby a director appointed by the president. To limit the CIG, Truman specificallyprohibited any clandestine or paramilitary activities. The CIG was to have “nopolice, law-enforcement or internal-security functions” or conduct“investigations inside the . . . United States.”The veteran spies and operatives of the old OSS were soon transferred to thisnew organization, operating under the designation of the Office of SpecialOperations (OSO). And these men of action soon wanted more elbow room in theirrestricted world of intelligence gathering.By 1947, the CIG’s staff had grown to nearly 2,000, with about one-thirdoperating overseas. But it continued to be only one of several intelligenceorganizations. This changed on September 15, 1947, when Truman signed theNational Security Act, creating the national Security Council (NSC), the AirForce as a separate branch of the services, and renaming the War Department theDepartment of Defense, uniting the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.With little notice, this act also created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),giving the United States its first full-blown peacetime intelligence service.In later years, Truman stated:I never had any thought . . . when I set up the CIA, that it would be injectedinto peacetime cloak-and-dagger operations. Some of the complications andembarrassment that I think we have experienced are in a part attributable to thefact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed fromits intended role.Under the National Security Act—passed in the heat of the growing anticommunisthysteria sweeping the United States and just two months after astill-controversial crash at Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico—the CIA wasresponsible only to the National Security Council, which was headed by thepresident, effectively giving the president absolute control over the newagency.The CIA had its own budget, much of this off the books and handled through thelittle-known Exchange Stabilization Fund of the Treasury Department, and wasauthorized to hire and train its own personnel. Yet the same restrictions of theold CIG remained—no clandestine or paramilitary operations and no internalspying.However, a catch-all phrase had been included in the CIA’s charter that statedthe agency could perform “such other functions and duties related tointelligence affecting the national security as the NSC may from time to timedirect.”Utilizing this phrase—and with the blessings of the National SecurityCouncil—the CIA in 1948 became active in suppressing communist influence in thenational elections in Italy. This marked the beginning of the agency’s career ofmeddling in the affairs of other nations.In 1949, the Central Intelligence Act was passed, exempting the CIA from alllaws requiring the disclosure of “functions, names, official titles, salariesand number of personnel employed by the Agency” and allowing the director tospend money from its secret budget simply by signing vouchers.Now operating with secret funds and with the vague authority of “other suchfunctions and duties related to intelligence,” the CIA began to flex itsmuscles. Victor Marchetti, a former executive assistant to the CIA’s deputydirector, wrote:From those few innocuous words the CIA has been able, over the years, to developa secret charter based on NSC directives and presidential executive orders, acharter almost completely at variance with the apparent intent of the law whichestablished the Agency. This vague phrase has provided the CIA with freedom toengage in covert action, the right to intervene secretly in the internal affairsof other nations. It has done so usually with the express approval of the WhiteHouse, but almost always without the consent of Congress, and virtually neverwith the knowledge of the American people.In 1948, the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was created by the NationalSecurity Council as a covert psychological and paramilitary operations unitunder Frank Wisner. By 1951, the OPC had run afoul of so many US laws andpolicies it was merged into the CIA and was known thereafter as the CIA’sDepartment of Plans. However, any attempt at curtailing such activities wasthwarted by the appointment of Allen Dulles as the new director.By 1955, the CIA contained more than 15,000 employees, not including thousandsof foreign assets and contract agents. In addition to its enormous secretbudget—often disguised as portions of other US government budgets—the CIAcreated a number of wholly or partly owned properties, or “fronts,” to providecover for clandestine operations.These fronts included airlines, import-export companies, “high-tech” firms,advertising agencies, foundations, and many others. And these were not dummybusinesses. In most ways they operated normally, generating additional money tofund agency operations. Using these fronts, the CIA channeled money to academic,labor, youth, and cultural organizations.Many foreign leaders—such as King Hussein of Jordan, Archbishop Makarios ofCypress, Luis Echeverria of Mexico, and Willy Brandt of West Germany—have beennamed as recipients of CIA funds over the years.It has been charged that the CIA, whose leaders have been drawn from the highestcircles of business and wealth in the United States, often has been merely asecurity force for big business, more concerned with American corporateinvestments than with true national security issues. For example, in 1953 thepopularly elected prime minister of Iran, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, whosegovernment had nationalized the oil industry, was overthrown in a coup initiatedby the CIA. The CIA man in charge of that operation was Kermit Roosevelt, wholater became vice president of Gulf Oil. Gulf Oil benefited greatly from the newIranian political situation.On June 18, 1954, a CIA-financed right-wing coup in Guatemala overthrew thepopularly elected government of Jacobo Arbenz, which had nationalized theproperty of United Fruit Company. Secretary of state John Foster Dulles’s lawfirm had written the United Fruit contracts with Guatemala in the 1930s. JohnMoors Cabot, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, was amajor United Fruit stockholder. And CIA director Allen Dulles had been presidentof United Fruit, while his predecessor as CIA director, General Walter BedellSmith, soon would become a United Fruit vice president.One reason the CIA succeeded in becoming a world-class force was therelationship of its longtime director, Allen Dulles, with his brother JohnFoster Dulles, the secretary of state. David Wise and Thomas B. Ross, authors ofThe Invisible Government, wrote:Uniquely, they embodied the dualism—and indeed the moral dilemma—of UnitedStates foreign policy since World War II. . . . Foster Dulles reflected theAmerican ethic; the world as we would like it to be. While he took thisposition, his brother was free to deal with nastier realities, to overturngovernments and engage in backstage political maneuvers all over the globe withthe CIA’s almost unlimited funds. He was, as Allen Dulles once put it, able to“fight fire with fire.” . . . It was under Allen Dulles’s stewardship that theCIA enjoyed its greatest expansion, particularly in the field ofgovernment-shaking secret operations overseas.And during the time the agency was expanding and initiating its activitiesacross the globe, few Americans had ever heard of the organization. The agency’sanonymity was largely the product of a timid news media. Former CIA directorWilliam Colby wrote, “The press, by and large, willingly accorded the CIA aprivileged position among government agencies and refrained from inquiring intoand reporting on its activities as a self-imposed act of patriotism.”“Patriotism” and “national security” were the watchwords of the CIA and otherintelligence organizations and were used effectively to keep secret a multitudeof sins and questionable activities. Some CIA activities clearly violated boththe agency’s charter and US laws. One agency endeavor—the search for effectivebrainwashing and behavior-modification methods—is especially chilling.The Manchurian Candidates [Contents.html#rsec40]The fact that German rocket scientists were brought to the United States afterWorld War II under Project Paperclip to become the leaders of the US spaceprogram is well documented. Not so well known is how German experimentation withmind control also was continued in America after the war.Although US judges at the Nuremberg war crimes trials sentenced seven Germanscientists to death for their part in human experimentation in the concentrationcamps, their research material was forwarded to the OSS and their work wascontinued. With the creation of the CIA, this work became part of the agency’sbehavior-modification program, first called BLUEBIRD, then later changed toARTICHOKE.By 1954, the ARTICHOKE program was part of the CIA’s Technical Services Staff(TSS), which also provided the agency with weaponry, disguises, gadgets, forgeddocuments, and codes. ARTICHOKE teams usually consisted of a psychiatrist, adrug expert, a technician, and a hypnotist, who sometimes posed as a polygraphoperator.Such programs to alter minds formed the basis of a 1959 book by Richard Condontitled The Manchurian Candidate. Later a movie that reportedly was one of JohnF. Kennedy’s favorites, the book concerns an American soldier captured in Koreawho is brainwashed into becoming a remote-controlled killer for the purpose ofassassinating a US presidential candidate.On April 13, 1953, the CIA mind-control program—including “covert use ofbiological and chemical materials” proposed by Richard Helms and managed by Dr.Sidney Gottlieb—was authorized by Director Dulles under the overall nameMK-ULTRA. Under MK-ULTRA, the CIA went beyond mind-control experimentation todevelop deadly toxins capable of killing without leaving a trace. One such toxinwas later used in pills agency officials gave to a mobster in the CIA-Mafiaplots to assassinate Fidel Castro.Interestingly, one of the two CIA field stations that were involved in MK-UL-TRAand had quantities of both LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and other chemicalmind-altering agents was at Atsugi in Japan, the same station where Lee HarveyOswald served as a Marine radar operator and apparently was involved inundercover operations.Since the CIA has admitted that its most convenient source of mind-controlguinea pigs were “individuals of dubious loyalty, suspected agents or plants,subjects having known reason for deception, etc.,” one must wonder whetherOswald may have been part of a mind-altering program of the agency—if in factthere was one. In an article published in Rolling Stone, the authors claim tohave contacted a Marine from Oswald’s unit who said he participated in some ofthe LSD experiments.In the summer of 1963, Oswald entered the office of New Orleans assistantdistrict attorney Edward Gillin. He was asked to take a seat but instead chooseto stand in front of Gillin’s desk. Oswald proceeded to question Gillin about anew drug called LSD. After spending almost an hour extolling the virtues of thedrug as one that would affect the social and economic history of the world forthe next two hundred years, Oswald said he wanted to try some and wished to knowif it was legal (which it was at that time). Thinking his visitor was a bitcrazy, Gillin suggested Oswald visit the police chemist with his query butadvised he take nothing without consulting a doctor first. Gillin never sawOswald again until recognizing him on TV accused of killing the president.The exact nature of Oswald’s relation to any CIA mind-control program likelywill never be known. According to John Marks, author of The Search for the“Manchurian Candidate,” Gottlieb, upon retiring from the agency in 1973 and withthe agreement of Helms, destroyed what they thought were the last remainingdocuments on MK-ULTRA.Since Oswald may have taken a mind-altering drug; since his killer, Jack Ruby,told Dallas police he had no recollection of shooting Oswald; since SirhanSirhan, the presumed assassin of Robert Kennedy, still claims he can’t rememberwhat happened in the Ambassador Hotel; and since a San Quentin psychologist, Dr.Eduard Simson, proclaimed that Sirhan had been “programmed” by drugs, hypnosis,or both, the possibility of mind control in the JFK assassination—whileadmittedly unlikely—cannot be ruled out.But the techniques of using someone under mind control by drugs and hypnosis asan assassin or decoy in an assassination had not yet been perfected in 1963. Itis more likely that conspirators at that time would have resorted to a lesssophisticated method—they would simply have hired professional assassins fromthe mob, the CIA, or the military and thrown a scapegoat to the public.[images/line.jpg]For all the myths that have arisen about CIA prowess, the actual history of theagency reveals as many glaring errors as victories.Agency analysts failed to foresee the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the 1968 TetOffensive in South Vietnam, the collapse of communism, or the terrorist attacksof September 11, 2001.One CIA officer deeply involved in the Cuban operations, including the Bay ofPigs, was William Harvey, who established and managed the CIA’s infamous“Executive Action” program of calculated assassinations code-named ZR-RIFLE.Referring to Harvey’s program, president Lyndon Johnson once commented, “We wererunning a damn Murder, Inc. in the Caribbean.”It is in this area—assassination plots—that the US intelligence community ingeneral, and the CIA in particular, have created serious suspicions in the mindsof researchers regarding possible complicity in the death of President Kennedy.CIA-Mafia Death Plots [Contents.html#rsec41]In September 1963, CIA officers again tried to hatch an assassination plotagainst Castro—this time using a Cuban government official named Dr. RolandoCubela. His CIA code name was AM/LASH.An unofficial Cuban minister, Cubela had contacted the CIA some two yearsearlier and offered to defect. The agency had persuaded him to remain in placeas a valuable conduit of inside information.This time, meeting in a São Paulo, Brazil, safe house, Cubela startled his CIAcontacts by offering to assassinate Castro if he had the support of the USgovernment. This offer was sent to Desmond FitzGerald, a personal friend ofRobert Kennedy and one of the CIA officials in charge of Operation Mongoose,that covert operation to bring down Cuba’s communist government.Despite cautions from CIA counterintelligence that Cubela might be a Castroagent testing US government intentions, FitzGerald ordered that Cubela be toldthat his offer to eliminate Castro was under consideration at the “highestlevels.” This strange story has been related in both Legend: The Secret World ofLee Harvey Oswald by Edward Jay Epstein and The Kennedys by John H. Davis.Toward the end of October Cubela made an extraordinary demand. He wantedpersonal assurance that the Kennedy administration actively supported his planto kill Castro. On October 29, again against the advice of counterintelligence,FitzGerald personally met with Cubela and assured him that once Castro was gone,the Kennedy administration would support a new Cuban government. But when Cubelaasked for a rifle with telescopic sights and the means to deliver poison,FitzGerald declined to discuss such specifics. Another meeting with Cubela wasset and on that day, the CIA case officer supplied Cubela with a poisonballpoint pen. Cubela was told the rifle and some explosives would be deliveredto him soon. Ironically, Cubela received his assassination tools from the CIA onNovember 22, 1963.Although no documentation of the AM/LASH plot has survived, some senior CIAofficials now claim that the plot did have the support of both Robert Kennedyand his brother. Since both are now dead, there’s no real way to know, plus theanimosity of certain CIA officers toward the Kennedys should be kept in mindwhen evaluating this charge.It was the knowledge of AM/LASH, however, that caused consternation among CIAofficials when Castro made certain public statements concerning assassinationplots. While attending a reception in the Brazilian embassy in Havana, Castrotold an Associated Press reporter, “Kennedy is the Batista of our time and themost opportunistic president of all time.” Castro went on to warn against“terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders,” adding, “United States leadersshould think that if they assist in terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders,they themselves will not be safe.” This warning has for years been used tosupport the theory that somehow Castro had learned of the CIA plots against himand, in retaliation, sent assassins after Kennedy. But since Castro didn’t catchCubela until 1966, it is unlikely that AM/LASH was the impetus of his 1963remarks.While the CIA’s Mongoose program continued in Florida, similar operations werebeing conducted in New Orleans, long a hotbed of Cuban exile–CIA activity. Oneof the centers of this activity was the shabby three-story office building at544 Camp Street, a connecting point for the CIA, the FBI, anti-Castro Cubans,and Lee Harvey Oswald.New Orleans [Contents.html#rsec42]Within days of Kennedy’s assassination, the FBI in New Orleans questioned DavidFerrie, who denied any knowledge of the assassination. The FBI agents let himgo, apparently unaware of Ferrie’s Civil Air Patrol connection to accusedassassin Lee Harvey Oswald or to New Orleans crime boss Carlos Marcello. Neitherapparently did the agents know that Ferrie had been working for Detective GuyBanister in the summer of 1963.Whatever information Ferrie gave the FBI will never be known, since theinterview was classified and locked away on orders of J. Edgar Hoover and in1976, the National Archives reported that Ferrie’s original statement wasmissing from its collection of assassination documents.Both Ferrie and Banister were well connected with the Cuban exiles living in NewOrleans. As a contract agent for the CIA, Ferrie claimed to have flown onhazardous missions into Cuba, including landing there on the night of theill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion.Ferrie’s role as CIA agent was confirmed in 1975 when Victor Marchetti, formerexecutive assistant to the CIA’s deputy director, stated that during high-levelCIA meetings in 1969, CIA director Richard Helms disclosed that Ferrie and otherfigures in the Garrison investigation had indeed worked for the agency in aidingthe anti-Castro Cubans.Banister investigator Jack Martin and others have told investigators through theyears of contact between CIA contract agent Ferrie and Oswald during 1963.Martin said he suspected that Ferrie “had taught Oswald how to purchase aforeign-made firearm.”According to Beverly Oliver, the “babushka lady,” Oswald and Ferrie were evenseen together in Jack Ruby’s Carousel Club shortly before the assassination.Delphine Roberts also claims that Oswald and Ferrie were associates. She saidthat on one occasion Ferrie even took Oswald to an anti-Castro guerrillatraining camp outside New Orleans “to train with rifles.” Once she saw Oswaldhanding out pro-Castro literature on a New Orleans street. Her boss, the rabidanticommunist Banister, reassured her, “Don’t worry about him. . . . He’sassociated with the office.” Roberts later said, “I knew there were such thingsas counterspies, spies and counterspies, and the importance of such things. So Ijust didn’t question them.”The day after Kennedy’s assassination, Secret Service agents went to 544 CampStreet after seeing the address on some of Oswald’s pamphlets. Guy Banister’soffice was closed. They learned that “Cuban revolutionaries” had had an officethere. The agents brushed the whole thing off by reporting that they hadn’tfound a trace of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee at 544 Camp Street.The Saga of Tosh Plumlee [Contents.html#rsec43]One man whose amazing travels for US intelligence and the military led himthrough the Cuban revolution and the Bay of Pigs Invasion on into the Kennedyassassination and even further into the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reaganadministration was William Robert Plumlee.Tosh, as he likes to be called, was born in 1937. After nearly becoming ajuvenile delinquent, he joined the US Army in April 1954 and was assigned to theTexas 49th Armored Division. Later he was transferred to Dallas, where he joinedthe 4th Army Reserve Military Intelligence Unit. While working as an aircraftmechanic at Dallas’s Love Field, Tosh earned his pilot’s license in 1956 and wassoon recruited by the CIA.Working under such CIA officials as William Harvey, Tracy Barnes, and RipRobertson, Tosh flew arms to Castro just prior to his 1959 revolution. After theUnited States turned against Castro, Tosh flew a reconnaissance mission overCuba but crashed just before the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Making his escape back tothe United States, Tosh continued his work for the agency. As a pilot operatingout of the JM/WAVE station in Miami, he ferried agents and materials all aroundthe Gulf of Mexico. He was shocked in later years to learn that one of hispassengers, a military officer known to him as Colonel Rawlston was actually theMafia chieftain John Roselli. His shock deepened when he recalled a secretflight he made on November 21, 1963.In 2004 Plumlee gave this “true account” of that flight:Beginning November 20, 1963, I was assigned to be a copilot on a top-secretflight, which was attached to a military intelligence unit and supported by theCIA. Our mission, we were told, was to abort a pending attempt on thepresident’s life which was to take place in Dallas. We were contracted as“cut-outs,” a system used to shield a secret operation from public exposure. Ourteam was based out of south Florida. My pilot for this operation was EmanuelRojas. We had flown together before. I was the copilot for this operation. Thefirst leg of the flight would be from Lantana, Florida (about five miles southof West Palm Beach), to Tampa, Florida. The aircraft used for the first phase ofthis trip was a D-18 Twin Beech aircraft. We took off before daybreak onNovember 21, 1963, expecting to arrive in Tampa about sunup. We were to pick upother personnel at Tampa. One of these people was John Roselli, whom I knew.I had known John Roselli before this flight. I had flown Roselli and others toplaces like Cuba, Bimini, Galveston, Las Vegas, and California. He was alsoknown to me as “Colonel Rawlston” or just “the Colonel.” We (Rojas and I) wereto pick up “the Colonel” at Tampa’s Congress Inn that morning. We changedaircraft at Tampa to a waiting DC-3 that was registered to “Atlantic Richfield,”and continued our trip to New Orleans, where a couple of people, who I did notknow, got off and a few others got on. The Colonel stayed on board the DC-3. Wecontinued our trip leaving New Orleans and continuing to Houston InternationalAirport, where we spent the night at the Shamrock Hilton, not far from theairport.The next morning, November 22, 1963, between 4:30–5 a.m., our weather briefingwas not favorable for a VFR [visual flight rules] flight into Dallas’s Red Birdairport. We selected Garland as an alternate in case the weather had notimproved by the time we arrived near Dallas air space. We did not file a flightplan nor intended to file IFR [instrument flight rules]. This would have left arecord of our flight with air traffic control. We continued to Garland, innortheast Dallas, instead of Redbird Airport in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas.We made this decision because of possible bad weather southwest of Dallas thathad not cleared as yet.We arrived in Garland near daybreak. There had been so many threats against thepresident’s life that we didn’t have a great sense of urgency about thisparticular one. While waiting out the bad weather in Garland, and about thirtyminutes after landing three of the passengers were picked up by car, includingRoselli. There are three documented corroborations of my presence at Garlandairport that morning. After the weather had cleared sufficiently for the planeto continue via VFR flight rules to Redbird Airport in Dallas, we left Garlandfor the ten-minute flight to Redbird. We landed at Redbird around 9:30 or 10:30a.m., perhaps as late as 11 a.m., where everybody got off and went their ownway.The pre-mission briefing was held at Loxahatchee, Florida, on the evening ofNovember 20th, but since I was not “field operational” at that time, except as a“contract pilot,” I was not directly addressed at the briefing, other thanrouting and weather reports pertaining to flying the team into position. . . . Ionly began to learn the full scope of the operation from my pilot Rojas and afield operative friend of mine named Sergio. Most of the details of thisoperation were told to me only after we had become airborne. I would learn moreoperational details upon reaching Redbird Airport.I learned that it had been discussed by the abort team where to go, how toabort, and what to look for. I had not at first paid much attention to any ofthese details as bits and pieces unfolded. I was told that the abort team, forwhom I was only the pilot at that time, would probably be looking for a minimumof 19 or 20 people that would be in the plaza. Most of the team members feltthat this was another false alarm, there had been many during the past fewweeks.Although my specific assigned function was only as a pilot, upon arriving atRedbird Airport, Sergio asked me if I wanted to come along and see thepresident. I could also act as a spotter for him and his team, which he saidwere assigned to the south side of the plaza. I was told other members of theteam would be patrolling the north side and the overpass. I understood we wouldbe looking for a type of triangulated ambush. I gladly accepted Sergio’s offer.It seemed like an adventure I didn’t want to miss. We were driven from RedbirdAirport to a place not far from the Oak Cliff Country Club, then driven toDealey Plaza, where we (Sergio and I) checked various areas and attempted tospot potential members of an attack team from the position on the South Knoll.While on the South Knoll, Sergio and I were attempting to evaluate the mostlogical places where shooters might be located, but everything was confused, thetiming was off; team members were late getting into position. They were notwhere they were supposed to be and the limited radio contacts that we had withthem were not working or spotty at best. It was soon after our arrival that themotorcade arrived. When the shots rang out, I had the impression of 4 or 5shots, with one being fired from behind and to my left on the South Knoll, nearthe underpass and south parking lot. While leaving via the south side of theunderpass near the train tracks, Sergio and I smelled gunpowder. I never sawRoselli in Dealey Plaza that day.We were picked up on the back side of the underpass, southwest side, by a personwho had previously been at the country club. After driving away, and on the wayback to Redbird we stopped in the parking lot of Ed McLemore’s Sportatorium,where Sergio changed out of the clothes he had muddied when he fell down theslippery west side of the railroad tracks. We stopped by the house in Oak Cliff,then returned to Redbird Airport. We waited for a few of the operatives who hadbeen on our flight into Dallas to return. We waited as long as we could beforedeparting without Roselli and some of the others. At approximately 2 o’clock inthe afternoon, we took off from Redbird without filing a flight plan. Ouroriginal flight out of Dallas called for us to fly to Sheppard Air Force Base inWichita Falls, Texas. But because of the assassination that routing was changedat the last minute by Rojas. We would head for Houston and back to southFlorida.On the plane, besides myself, were Rojas, Sergio, a person who I knew as Gatorfrom the Loxahatchee camp, and two other individuals that I didn’t know. Gatorhad identifying characteristics of an unusually large Adam’s apple and a missingfinger, which had supposedly been bitten off at an alligator farm.The people on the flight out of Dallas were very quiet. I interpreted theirsilence as dejection at the mission’s failure to abort the assassination of thepresident. I believed that if these men had been the shooters or assassinsthemselves, they would have been very excited because they had carried it off.That’s why to this day I take issue with the idea, which I have been asked tospeculate on many times, that the attack on the president was in behalf of theCIA, Mafia, or military intelligence, and I had unknowingly flown an attack teamin which had assassinated the president.Shortly after this flight, Tosh was arrested and extradited to Colorado, wherehe was prosecuted for passing bad checks. Only one check in the amount of $51.25was produced and Tosh tried to explain that the CIA had failed to deposit hispay for January 1962. He was jailed, which kept him out of the public eye duringthe time of the Warren Commission. Released in 1964, Tosh got married and triedto forget his life as a “black ops” pilot. But it didn’t work.During the Reagan administration, Tosh was a pilot in the Iran-Contra scandal,in which illegal arms were shipped to Iran in hopes of freeing Americanhostages. Profits from these arms sales were then used to fund anticommunists,or Contras, in Nicaragua. Tosh said arms were flown to the Contras and theircocaine was flown back to the United States.In 1977, Plumlee testified behind closed doors before Idaho senator FrankChurch’s Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect toIntelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee. This panel probedillegal and clandestine activities of the FBI and CIA. He also testified beforethe Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1990 and 1991 concerning his knowledgeof the Iran-Contra missions. Despite his testimony and box loads of governmentdocuments pertaining to Plumlee and the operations he has disclosed, Toshremains a controversial figure in the assassination research community, withmany claiming he has failed to corroborate his various stories, as if hisdetractors expect illicit government operations to be thoroughly documented.In 1991, this author accompanied Tosh on a driving trip to Florida where hepointed out various anti-Castro safe houses and aircraft still sitting onrunways that were used in anti-Castro activities, and was warmly greeted inAlpha 66 headquarters, one of the Cuban exile organizations.One of the aspects of Tosh’s story that has struck researchers as bizarre is hisclaim that he and other “black ops” operatives were quartered in the LoxahatcheeWork Prison, which was next to a landing strip they used to fly in and out onmissions. Yet, in 1991, the old prison was still there, as was the adjacentlanding strip. And in a telephone conversation with this author, Alton Chaney,the retired warden of the prison, confirmed that in the 1960s the county had acontract with the federal government to house some federal prisoners. He said hewas never told anything about the inmates but they seemed to have been involvedin some sort of witness protection program and he knew the names he was givenfor them were false. “It was kinda funny,” recalled Chaney. “Some of thoseprisoners just kinda came and went.” A prison record would indeed seem to be theperfect alibi. One could claim he had never been at the scene of the crime, ashe was in jail at the time. But none of this will ever be proven, as thestockade commander, O. C. Reynolds, said when he took over the prison in theearly 1970s he was surprised to find no records were available for past years.Returning to Dallas, Tosh was able to describe and locate with precision Cubansafe houses, including the garage apartment behind Oswald’s Beckley Streetrented room and Oswald’s 1962 apartment at 602 Elsbeth, which he was able todescribe accurately as determined in a later visit by this author.There was also an odd connection between Tosh’s story of the assassination andthat of James Files, who in later years claimed to be the Grassy Knoll gunman.Both men, apparently unknown to each other, were told the people who went intoDealey Plaza that day were “abort” teams sent to stop an assassination attempt.Both also started their careers in the US military. Files even said that he wastold by John Roselli that the gangster was flown into Dallas on a “militaryflight.”Considering the accounts of Plumlee, Ferrie, Martin, and Roberts, as well asOswald’s bizarre military record and his trip to Russia, one must seriouslyconsider that the ex-Marine was working in intelligence, just as his motherclaimed.Was Oswald a Spy? [Contents.html#rsec44]After reviewing all available evidence, the answer to the above question seemsto be an unequivocal yes.The following is a quick look at some of the evidence pointing to Oswald’sinvolvement with spy work:—His childhood—as a bright loner who read a wide range of books and was drawn tounpopular ideas, attracted by spy stories (the TV show I Led Three Lives and IanFleming’s James Bond novels were among his favorites)—perfectly fits the profileof people most desired for intelligence work.—Oswald’s Marine career is checkered with inconsistencies and unexplainedabsences suggesting secret intelligence training.—He was assigned to Atsugi base in Japan, which housed a large CIA facility.—Oswald had an incredible ability with the Russian language. Several Russians,including his wife, said he spoke like a native, yet this high-school dropoutreportedly taught himself Russian from books.—The fact that several people—including a former CIA paymaster, Oswald’s Marineroommate James Botelho, and fellow Marine Gerry Patrick Hemming—have stated thatOswald worked for US intelligence.—The manner in which Oswald traveled so easily in and out of Russia as well asthe unaccounted-for funds he used suggests intelligence guidance.—The ability of this American “defector” to leave the Soviet Union with hisRussian-born wife at a time when most Russians were being denied exit permits.—The ease with which this would-be defector obtained passports in both 1959 and1963.—The fact that Oswald wrote a lengthy report on his activities in Russia and,later, made a detailed report to the FBI concerning his Fair Play for CubaCommittee activities in New Orleans.—Oswald’s notebook contained the word “microdots,” a common spy technique ofphotographically reducing information to a small dot.—Oswald’s nonbinding “defection” to Russia fit perfectly the profile of anOffice of Naval Intelligence program to infiltrate American servicemen into theSoviet Union during the late 1950s.—One of Oswald’s closest contacts, George DeMohrenschildt, was himself anintelligence operative, first for the Nazis and later for the CIA.One of the strongest pieces of evidence proving Oswald’s spy work concerns asmall Minox camera found among his effects by Dallas police. Informationdeveloped by the Dallas Morning News in 1978 revealed the camera was notavailable to the public in 1963. It may have been spy equipment issued toOswald. This evidence was so explosive that the FBI tried to get Dallasdetectives to change their reports regarding the camera and for nearly fifteenyears kept hidden photos taken by Oswald.Dallas detectives Guy Rose and R. S. Stovall reported finding the Minox cameraloaded with film in Oswald’s Marine sea bag in the Irving home of Michael andRuth Paine hours after the assassination. The three-inch-long German-made camerawas famous for being used by spies on both sides during World War II. Aninventory of Oswald’s property taken from the Paine home was made on November26, 1963. Listed under item 375 was “one Minox camera.” This inventory list waswitnessed by agent Warren De Brueys, the FBI man in New Orleans who had beenassigned to monitor Oswald during the spring and summer of 1963. Later, however,the FBI property inventory listed item 375 as a “Minox light meter.” DetectiveRose told the Dallas Morning News, “[The FBI] were calling it a light meter, Iknow that. But I know a camera when I see it . . . . The thing we got at Irvingout of Oswald’s sea bag was a Minox camera. No question about it. They tried toget me to change the records because it wasn’t a light meter. I don’t know whythey wanted it changed, but they must have had some motive for it.”The motive may have been that the existence of the camera pointed to Oswald’sintelligence connections.Dallas Morning News reporter Earl Golz contacted Minox Corporation and spoke toKurt Lohn, formerly in charge of Minox distribution in New York City. Accordingto Lohn, the serial number of the camera found in Oswald’s belongings—number27259—did not exist among any Minox cameras distributed for commercial sale inthe United States. Lohn said all Minox cameras distributed in the United Statescarried six-digit serial numbers beginning with 135000. Number 27259 was “not aregistered number . . . not a valid number,” said Lohn. Golz also determinedthat Minox did not sell a light meter in the United States in 1963.A later FBI report stated that a Minox III camera was obtained on January 31,1964, from Ruth Paine and that it belonged to her husband, who worked for BellHelicopter. However, Mrs. Paine told Golz she did not remember being asked toturn over such a camera. Michael Paine reportedly also had a Minox camera but itwas damaged and “unworkable.”In 1979, acting on a Freedom of Information Act request by an assassinationresearcher, the FBI, which had denied the existence of any Minox camera,released about twenty-five photographs taken with a Minox camera belonging toOswald. Michael Paine was unable to recall taking any pictures such as the onesthe FBI released.On page 113 [Chapter004.html#page_113] of a book published by Dallas policechief Jesse Curry in 1969 is a photograph of Oswald’s property taken from thePaine home. Clearly pictured is the camera along with various Minox cameraequipment, including a binocular-type telephoto lens.Who issued Oswald an unregistered Minox “spy” camera? More important, why didthe FBI attempt to have Dallas police change their reports to indicate a lightmeter was found rather than a camera?In 1976, a CIA document was released that showed that the agency indeed hadconsidered Oswald for recruitment. This contradicted the sworn Warren Commissiontestimony of CIA official Richard Helms, who stated the agency had never had “oreven contemplated” any contact with Oswald. This document, written by anunidentified CIA officer three days after Kennedy’s assassination, states “weshowed intelligence interest” in Oswald and “discussed . . . the laying on ofinterviews.”Harry J. Dean, who said he participated in undercover operations against Castroas well as the infiltration of such organizations as the Fair Play for CubaCommittee, the Minutemen, and the John Birch Society for the CIA, claimed Oswaldshot no one in Dallas, but was set up to take the blame for the assassination bya conspiracy headed by US congressman John Rousselot and General Edwin Walker.Dean also explained that “Oswald wasn’t in the Security Index because the FBIofficials knew that he was working to preserve security, not hinder it.”An internal CIA cable dated October 16, 1963, indicated that more than a monthprior to the assassination at least six senior CIA officials were apprised by a“usually reliable and extremely sensitive source” that a Lee Oswald had visitedthe Soviet embassy in Mexico City in September. The memo stated this Oswald was“probably identical” to a “Lee Henry Oswald,” a Marine radar operator who hadrenounced his US citizenship in Russia. A later CIA message on October 22corrected the name to Lee Harvey Oswald.“The CIA would have kept the names of these highly-regarded officers—TomKaramessines, Bill Hood, John Whitten (‘John Scelso’), Jane Roman, and BettyEgeter—secret for thirty years,” wrote Jefferson Morley, a former editor at theWashington Post, in 2012. “Why? Because the officers most knowledgeable aboutOswald reported to two of the most powerful men in the CIA: Deputy DirectorRichard Helms and Counterintelligence Chief James Angleton.”Morley added, “We can’t do much about the JFK tragedy at this late date, but wecan acknowledge that CIA negligence led directly to the president’s death. Theofficers who obscured information about Oswald should be stripped of any medalsor commendations they received for their job performance in 1963. Fifty yearslater, it’s time for accountability.”But others saw much more than negligence involved in this obfuscation ofOswald’s records prior to the assassination. There are the questions concerninga CIA “201” file on Oswald discovered only in 1977. The existence of this filecame to light after a Freedom of Information Act request by assassinationresearchers. Many persons knowledgeable about the agency equate a 201 file witha personnel file, implying Oswald had worked for the CIA. Agency officials toldthe House Select Committee on Assassinations that the file on Oswald was nothingunusual and reflected merely that Oswald had “potential intelligence orcounterintelligence significance.” However, at least three former CIA officershave stated publicly that the mere existence of a 201 file on Oswald indicated arelationship between the ex-Marine and the agency.Victor Marchetti, formerly an executive assistant to the CIA’s deputy director,said, “Basically, if Oswald had a 201 file, he was an agent.”Bradley E. Ayers, a CIA officer who trained anti-Castro Cubans, added, “[A 201file meant Oswald was] either a contract agent, working for them full time, orhe was on some kind of assignment for the CIA.”Former CIA agent Patrick McGarvey, said, “If a guy has a 201 file, that meanshe’s a professional staff employee of the organization.”The CIA went to great lengths to convince the House Committee that possessing a201 file on Oswald—and that keeping this information secret for nearly fifteenyears—was in no way suspicious.The committee, however, found many problems with the 201 file. For example,Oswald’s file reportedly was opened on December 9, 1960, yet a confidentialState Department telegram reporting Oswald’s attempted defection to Russia—causeenough to open a file on him—was sent to the CIA back on October 31, 1959.Other problems with the Oswald file are that a former official with the CIA’sDirectorate of Operations records explained an “AG” code on the file that variedfrom the official agency explanation that this pertained to American defectors.Also, the 201 file was under the name “Lee Henry Oswald,” leading the committeeto wonder whether dual files were kept (a suspicion the CIA denied). One CIAmemo indicated as many as thirty-seven documents were missing from the Oswaldfile, although agency officials later claimed they were missing only at the timethe memo was written.Further, a recently obtained CIA document states that Oswald’s 201 file filled“two four-drawer safes,” yet the House committee was given a virtually emptyfolder.Oswald’s role with the CIA was cemented in 1995 with the publication of Oswaldand the CIA by the respected military historian John M. Newman, who discoveredby analyzing internal CIA messages that Oswald, knowingly or unknowingly, wasbeing used operationally by the agency prior to the JFK assassination. Thisshocking information—that Oswald was being used by the CIA prior to theassassination—apparently was not considered newsworthy by the corporate massmedia, which failed to widely report on this development.Another minor but intriguing fact indicating Oswald’s spy work is that at thetime of his arrest, he was carrying a three-by-two-inch top of adepartment-store box labeled “Cox’s Ft. Worth.” Intelligence agents have beenknown to carry such innocuous but unusual items, called bona fides, to identifythemselves to other agents. The box top’s significance is enhanced by the factthat it was not included in the Warren Commission exhibits, which presentedthousands of less relevant items.However, the whole question of Oswald’s connection to US intelligence is so fullof claims and counterclaims, deceit and misinformation, it is unlikely the wholetruth of the matter will ever be resolved.What is known—or at least believed by most people who have studied the issue atany depth—is that the weight of the evidence proves Oswald was in some wayconnected with US intelligence work, exactly as his mother always claimed.[images/line.jpg]While at the time of the JFK assassination the official story was that no USgovernment agency had been interested in Oswald or knew of his whereabouts, itis now known that both the CIA and the FBI were keeping a close watch on theex-Marine’s activities. Oswald’s alleged trip to Mexico City between September26 and October 3, 1963, is a case in point. According to the Warren Commission,Oswald was in Mexico City to visit the Soviet and Cuban embassies. Proof ofthese visits came from the statements of a Cuban embassy employee, Silvia Duran,and from CIA operatives monitoring the Soviet embassy.On October 10, 1963, yet another CIA teletype went to the State Department, theFBI, immigration authorities, and the Department of the Navy regarding the“possible presence of Subject [Oswald] in Mexico City”:On October 1, 1963, a reliable and sensitive source in Mexico reported that anAmerican male, who identified himself as Lee Oswald, contacted the SovietEmbassy in Mexico City. . . . The American was described as approximately 35years old, with an athletic build, about six feet tall, with a recedinghairline. . . . It is believed that Oswald may be identical to Lee HarveyOswald, born on 18 October 1939 in New Orleans, Louisiana.Obviously this description did not match that of the twenty-three-year-old,five-foot-nine, slender Oswald in Dallas.The Warren Commission, seriously concerned about the ties between Oswald and theSoviets and Cubans in Mexico City, asked the CIA for documentation of Oswald’sactivities. After months of foot-dragging, the agency could provide only theunsupported statement of Duran as proof that Oswald had been at the Cubanembassy.Not shown to the Warren Commission was a cable the director of the CIA sent toits station in Mexico City urging the secret arrest of Silvia Duran on the dayafter the assassination. Duran, a twenty-six-year-old Mexican national, had beenemployed at the Cuban embassy only one month before Oswald allegedly arrived inMexico. Her predecessor had been killed in an automobile accident. The CIA cableregarding Duran’s arrest, declassified only in recent years, stated:Arrest of Silvia Duran is extremely serious matter which could prejudice USfreedom of action on entire question of Cuban responsibility. . . . With fullregard for Mexican interests, request you ensure that her arrest is keptabsolutely secret, that no information from her is published or leaked, that allsuch info is cabled to us, and that fact of her arrest and her statements arenot spread to leftist or disloyal circles in the Mexican government.In a 1978 article, Mark Lane concluded:This almost incredible cable reveals the extent of CIA control over Mexicanpolice officials, many of whom had been trained by the CIA, and many of whomwere engaged by the CIA while they ostensibly worked for the Mexican government.The CIA’s willingness to order Mexican police officials to make false statementsto their own superiors and to mislead the “circles in the Mexican government”provides an insight into the CIA’s desperation to secure some evidence to prove. . . that Oswald had gone to the Cuban Embassy.Apparently the statements that Duran gave to the Mexican authorities were not totheir liking. She was not released for several days and only then after she hadidentified Oswald as the man who visited the embassy.Once free, Duran began to speak of her experience. This prompted yet another CIAcable, which ordered CIA personnel to have Duran rearrested, but to conceal whowas behind the action. A portion of this cable stated, “To be certain that thereis no misunderstanding between us, we want to insure that Silvia Duran gets noimpression that Americans are behind her re-arrest. In other words we wantMexican authorities to take responsibility for the whole affair.”Duran was rearrested and would not speak of her experiences afterward. She wasnever interviewed or called as a witness by the Warren Commission, which neverlearned of her two arrests.Since the Oswald in the Cuban embassy apparently made quite a scene when told hecould not get a visa to Cuba in three days—he shouted and called the embassypersonnel “bureaucrats”—he should have been well remembered by Duran and othersthere. But in 1978, Cuban consul Eusebio Azcue told the House Select Committeeon Assassinations that he was convinced the man who visited the embassy in 1963was not the Oswald arrested in Dallas. After viewing photos of Oswald, Azcuestated, “My belief is that this gentleman was not, is not, the person or theindividual who went to the consulate.”Silvia Duran—perhaps due to her experience in the hands of the police—hasmaintained over the years that the man was Oswald. However, in 1979, authorAnthony Summers arranged for her to watch films of Lee Harvey Oswald. Duran, whoadmitted that her identification of Oswald was more from the name than from thefuzzy newspaper photos printed at the time, watched the Oswald films andconcluded, “I was not sure if it was Oswald or not. . . . The man on the film isnot like the man I saw here in Mexico City.” To add to Duran’s confusion, sherecalled the man who visited the consulate was short, no more than five feet sixinches in height—far shorter than the five-foot-nine Lee Oswald.While the CIA stated that both the Cuban and Soviet embassies were underphotographic surveillance during Oswald’s visits, they could offer no proof.Lamely, CIA officials explained to the Warren Commission that the camera at theSoviet embassy was turned off on Saturdays (the day Oswald supposedly visited)and that the camera at the Cuban embassy just happened to break down the dayOswald was there. However, the day of the assassination, CIA officials sentphotos taken outside the Soviet embassy in Mexico City to the FBI, claiming theywere of Oswald. They are obviously of someone else. This someone appears to beabout thirty-five years old, six feet tall, with an athletic build. CIAofficials admitted there had been a “mix-up” on the photos.The absence of any valid photos of Oswald at the embassies raises suspicion thatan impostor was posing as Oswald during these embassy visits. Further evidenceof this comes from an episode involving tape recordings. In 1976, at the onsetof the House assassinations investigation, CIA officer David Atlee Phillips,stationed in Mexico City at the time of Oswald’s alleged visit, told the Housecommittee’s general counsel that the CIA had tape-recorded conversations betweenOswald and the Soviet embassy but had not told the Warren Commission. Whenpressed on why the tapes, clear proof of Oswald’s Mexican visits, had not beengiven to the Commission, Phillips said they had been routinely destroyed about aweek after Oswald’s visit since prior to the assassination Oswald was notconsidered important.It should be noted that in its report on Oswald’s Mexico City visit, the Housecommittee concluded that the CIA station there did not report all information onOswald “in an accurate and expeditious manner prior to the assassination” to CIAheadquarters.Phillips’s testimony was thrown into doubt when, long after his 1976 testimony,a five-page FBI document dated November 23, 1963, became public. According tothis document, which was not seen by the Warren Commission, FBI agents who werequestioning Oswald in Dallas were informed by CIA officers that Oswald hadcontacted the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. The report went on to state,“Special agents of this Bureau, who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas, Texas,have observed photographs of the individual referred to above and have listenedto a recording of his voice. These special agents are of the opinion that theabove-referred-to individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.”If this FBI report is correct, then the CIA wiretap tape of Oswald was notdestroyed in October but was available to bureau agents the day after theassassination. When, then, was this evidence destroyed and by whom?One disturbing aspect of all this is that either the CIA notified other agenciesin October that Oswald was in Mexico City, not knowing the man was an impostor,then failed to follow up on their mistake later. Or, more ominously, the agencyknowingly participated in a scheme to place Oswald in Mexico City at thattime—nearly two months before the assassination. Was this an attempt to linkOswald with the Soviets and Cuba? Or was another Oswald in Mexico City intent ondelivering the cancer-causing agent, prompting the need for an impostor todivert attention from the cancer plot?It is equally disturbing that the House Select Committee on Assassinations madea three hundred–page report on these mysterious happenings in Mexico City, thenfailed to put it into its published report claiming the information was withheldto protect the CIA’s “sensitive sources and methods.”Another Mexico incident, which has been misreported for years, concerns a notefrom Oswald to a “Mr. Hunt.”A Message from Oswald [Contents.html#rsec45]In August 1975, Texas JFK researcher Penn Jones Jr. received a typewrittenletter in Spanish from Mexico City signed only with the initials “P.S.”Translated, the letter read:Dear Sir:At the end of last year I gave Mr. [Clarence] Kelly, the director of the FBI, aletter from Lee Oswald. To my understanding it could have brought out thecircumstances to the assassination of President Kennedy.Since Mr. Kelly hasn’t responded to that letter, I’ve got the right to believesomething bad might happen to me, and that is why I see myself obligated to keepmyself away for a short time.Convinced of the importance of that letter mentioned and knowing that you havebeen doing some investigation independently of the assassination, I’m sendingyou a copy of the same letter.Accompanying this typed letter was a copy of a handwritten note in English datedNovember 8, 1963, that reads:Dear Mr. Hunt,I would like information concer[n]ing my position. I am asking only forinformation.I am suggesting that we discuss the matter fully before any steps are taken byme or anyone else.Thank you,Lee Harvey OswaldJones, too, sent this information to the FBI and he, too, received no reply.Earl Golz, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, later obtained a copy of theOswald note from Jones. He had three handwriting experts in Dallas compare thenote to known examples of Oswald’s handwriting. The experts all agreed that thehandwriting was the same. The Dallas Morning News carried an accurate account ofthe strange note and asked whether “Mr. Hunt” might refer to Dallas oilman H. L.Hunt. However, handwriting experts for both the FBI and the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations were suspicious of the letter’s legitimacy. JosephP. McNally, a former NYPD crime lab commander and a veteran examiner ofquestioned documents, told the committee that because the Oswald letter was aphoto reproduction and that some oddities in Oswald’s signature were found,experts were unable to reach a conclusion as to the letter’s authenticity,“although the writing pattern or the overall letter designs are consistent withthose as written on the other documents.”In 1983, it was learned that the FBI studied the note with the idea it may havebeen intended for Hunt’s son, Nelson Bunker Hunt. The results of the FBI probe,however, have never been made public.Jones pointed out that the note came from Mexico City and that allegedly CIAofficer E. Howard Hunt, who was in charge of anti-Castro Cubans at the time, wasstationed there along with David Atlee Phillips during Oswald’s reported visit.Jones told this author, “To me, knowing Hunt’s background with the CubanRevolutionary Committee and the CIA, it makes more sense that the note isaddressed to E. Howard Hunt.”But since neither the FBI nor the two official government investigations appearsto have taken an interest in the note, there the matter rests.The fact of the Oswald note and its accompanying letter leads some assassinationresearchers to believe that Oswald’s brief and mysterious visit to Mexico Citymight provide clues that US government agents were behind the assassination.[images/line.jpg]Yet another contact with the CIA that has become known only in recent yearsinvolves a man who “coincidentally” obtained the Mexican travel permit numberjust before Oswald’s—William George Gaudet.When applying for a new passport in June 1963, Oswald did not try to hide hispast or his intentions. On the application, he acknowledged he might travel toRussia and other European countries later that year. He also noted that hisprevious passport had been canceled. Despite these admissions—coupled with thefact that the State Department, which loaned him money to return from the SovietUnion, knew of his attempted defection and threat to give military secrets tothe Soviets—Oswald received a new passport within twenty-four hours.On September 17, a week after the alleged meeting between Oswald and CIA caseofficer “Maurice Bishop,” Oswald visited the Mexican consulate in New Orleansand applied for a tourist card. He was issued card number 24085, which was validfor fifteen days.After the assassination, the FBI, with the help of Mexican authorities,identified every person who had applied for Mexican entry papers on September17—all but one. The FBI reported they could not locate the record of the cardholder immediately preceding Oswald, No. 24084. However, in 1975, apparently dueto a bureaucratic mix-up in declassifying FBI documents, it was learned thatcard holder No. 24084 was William George Gaudet, who had worked for the CIA formore than twenty years.Gaudet claimed that sheer coincidence placed his name just ahead of Oswald’s onthe Mexican tourist card application sheet. Gaudet, who worked in the area ofLatin America for the agency, operated the Latin American Newsletter for anumber of years. Shortly after the assassination, Gaudet said, he wasinterviewed by FBI agents, but only after obtaining the approval of his CIA bossin New Orleans. No record of that interview has been made public.In a 1978 interview with author Anthony Summers, Gaudet admitted he had knownOswald in New Orleans, but then qualified this by saying he had only observedOswald handing out leaflets. “He was a strange man, an unusual man,” wasGaudet’s description of Oswald. Gaudet did firmly state that while in NewOrleans, Oswald was in contact with known CIA and FBI agents. Gaudet toldSummers, “I do know that I saw him one time with a former FBI agent by the nameof Guy Banister.” He also mentioned David Ferrie, saying, “He was with Oswald.”Gaudet said he did not accompany Oswald on a bus to Mexico, but went by air. Henow claims he cannot remember whether his 1963 Mexican trip involvedintelligence activity. He also said that due to his experience with the CIA, heis not surprised that little information concerning Oswald’s intelligenceactivities has been forthcoming: “[CIA officials] told me frankly when I didthings for them that if something went awry they would never recognize me oradmit who I was. If I made a mistake, that was just tough, and I knew it.” Theformer CIA operative went on to say he finds it “extremely possible” that Oswaldwas working for some American intelligence agency and added, “I think he was apatsy. . . . I think he was set up on purpose.” Gaudet also agreed with manyassassination researchers who believe that the anti-Castro Cubans were involvedin a plot to kill Kennedy. But when asked if he thought the Cubans could havecarried out an assassination alone, he replied, “No, I don’t think so.”But if Gaudet did not actually accompany Oswald to Mexico, one very suspiciousman did—Albert Osborne. Although the passenger list for Continental Trailwaysbus No. 5133, which allegedly carried Oswald to Mexico City, is missing, the FBImanaged to locate some of the travelers, including two Australian girls who toldof a conversation with a man who told them of his experiences in the Marines andin Russia. These girls told the FBI that the man also had sat next to and talkedat length with an older man.FBI agents tried to locate a man named John Howard Bowen who had been onOswald’s bus. However, they found only Albert Osborne, but Osborne seemed toknow a lot about Bowen. After three visits from the FBI, Osborne finallyadmitted that he was the man they were seeking, having used the alias “JohnBowen” for many years. He denied ever having met Oswald. Even the WarrenCommission didn’t buy that, stating “his denial cannot be credited.”Osborne claimed to be a missionary who traveled extensively all over the world,although he never said how these travels were financed. Also, no confirmation ofhis story could be found by checking border records in the countries he claimedto have visited. Despite his lies to the FBI regarding his name, no charges wereever brought against Osborne.In recent years, several assassination researchers have claimed that Osborneworked for the CIA, but no hard evidence of this has been established. It isinteresting to note, however, that when Oswald ordered Fair Play for CubaCommittee materials printed in New Orleans, he used the name “Osborne.”Other intriguing connections between the CIA and the JFK assassination concernGeorge DeMohrenschildt and the Carcano rifle found in the Texas School BookDepository.DeMohrenschildt and the Agency [Contents.html#rsec46]George DeMohrenschildt and his wife, Jeanne, were identified by the WarrenCommission as the people closest to Lee Harvey Oswald just before theassassination. DeMohrenschildt’s son-in-law, Gary Taylor, even told the WarrenCommission, “If there was any assistance [to Oswald] or plotters in theassassination they were, in my opinion, most probably the DeMohrenschildts.”DeMohrenschildt undoubtedly is one of the most colorful and suspicious of allthe persons connected to Oswald. He even wrote to Lyndon Johnson in April 1963,at a time he was in contact with Lee Oswald, and was told by LBJ aide WalterJenkins a meeting with the vice president might be arranged. Based on CIA memosnow available, thanks to Freedom of Information Act suits, it is known thatDeMohrenschildt had a relationship with the agency dating back to OSS days. Onememo by former CIA director Richard Helms states that DeMohrenschildt applied towork for the government as early as 1942 but was rejected “because he wasalleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.”The charge had some substance. After a trip to Yugoslavia with his wife in 1957(they were shot at by guards of Marshal Tito), DeMohrenschildt provided the CIAwith “foreign intelligence which was promptly disseminated to other federalagencies in 10 separate reports,” according to the Helms memo. Another agencymemo indicated DeMohrenschildt also furnished lengthy reports on travels he madethrough Mexico and Panama at the time of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Asked by a Warren Commission attorney if he believed the DeMohrenschildts mayhave been spying on the invasion preparations, Taylor replied, “Yes.”In fact, at the time DeMohrenschildt was befriending Lee Harvey Oswald, one ofhis close friends in Dallas was J. Walton Moore with the CIA’s Domestic ContactsDivision. DeMohrenschildt publicly stated that before becoming involved withOswald, he had checked with Moore. Moore, according to DeMohrenschildt, saidunhesitatingly, “Yes, he’s okay. He’s just a harmless lunatic.”In a CIA memorandum written not long after Oswald returned from Russia, the CIAauthor wrote, “Don’t push too hard to get the information we need, because thisindividual [Oswald] looks odd.”Much later it was learned how the CIA was to further “debrief” Oswald—by usingthe genial George DeMohrenschildt. Author Edward Epstein interviewedDeMohrenschildt on the morning of March 29, 1977. That same morning, aninvestigator from the House Select Committee on Assassinations had attempted tocontact DeMohrenschildt. Three hours later DeMohrenschildt was dead from ashotgun blast to the head. His death was ruled a suicide although the detectivein charge of his investigation expressed some reservations about this verdict.According to Epstein, DeMohrenschildt said Moore encouraged him to see Oswaldand that, in fact, he was to question Oswald “unwittingly” about his stay inRussia. DeMohrenschildt said that after his first meeting with the ex-Marine,Oswald gave him a lengthy memo covering his activities in Russia.DeMohrenschildt, a petroleum engineer, and Moore had offices in the same Dallasbank building and often ate lunch together, according to Jeanne DeMohrenschildt.The CIA memos, Moore’s closeness, and DeMohrenschildt’s own testimony allconfirm that a certain relationship existed between the CIA and the man closestto Oswald in early 1963. While this does not necessarily involve the agency in aplot to kill Kennedy, it raises questions about what agency officials might haveknown regarding such a plot.[images/line.jpg]In a related issue that belies the idea set forth in 1963 that the CIA wasneither aware of Oswald nor interested in him, it is now known that the agencywas opening Oswald’s mail while he was in Russia. In letters to his mother,Marguerite Oswald, in 1976, former CIA legislative counsel George L. Caryadmitted that the agency had opened mail from her to her son while he was inRussia. Cary said the admission was a result of an investigation into the CIA’smail intercept program—known as HT-Lingual—by the Government Information andIndividual Rights Subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee.Another possible connection between the CIA and the JFK assassination concerns aformer CIA operative named Robert D. Morrow. In his book Betrayal, Morrow tellshow he purchased four 6.5 mm Carcano rifles on orders from a CIA superior.Morrow remains convinced that at least one of these rifles ended up in the handsof Dallas police on November 22, 1963.Morrow even presented a plausible, though unproven, account of theassassination:Oswald, who went to Russia for the CIA and was an FBI informant by the summer of1963, was brought into an assassination plot led by CIA consultant Clay Shaw,using right-wing CIA operatives and anti-Castro Cubans headed by Jack Ruby inDallas and Guy Banister in New Orleans. This group, operating outside Agencycontrol, manipulated events to insure Oswald being named as the assassin. Theyalso used an Oswald look-alike to incriminate the ex-Marine by firing shots fromthe Texas School Book Depository. Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit was killed bythis Oswald substitute when he failed to go along with the group’s scheme tohave Tippit kill the real Oswald in the Texas Theater. With the capture ofOswald, Ruby was compelled to stalk and finally kill the accused assassin.The Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition also raised questions about CIA involvement.According to an FBI document, the 6.5 mm ammunition found in the Texas SchoolBook Depository was part of a batch manufactured on a US government contract byWestern Cartridge Corporation of East Alton, Illinois, which is now a part ofWinchester-Western Division of Olin Industries.In the mid-1950s, the Marine Corps purchased four million rounds of thisammunition, prompting the author of one FBI document to state, “The interestingthing about this order is that it is for ammunition which does not fit andcannot be fired in any of the United States Marine Corps weapons. This givesrise to the obvious speculation that it is a contract for ammunition placed bythe CIA with Western Cartridge Corporation under a USMC cover for concealmentpurposes.”It is well-known that the CIA had used “sanitized” weapons—that is, weapons thatcannot be traced directly back to the agency or the United States—in variousmissions around the world.Most of the information available suggesting links between the assassination andthe CIA is circumstantial—which is hardly surprising. After all, agencyofficials could hardly be expected to reveal information possibly connectingthem to the president’s death. However, at this time there can be little doubtthat many persons connected to Oswald—David Ferrie, Guy Banister, CarlosBringuier, and other anti-Castro Cubans—were also connected to the CIA, althoughsome knowledgeable persons, such as former CIA operative Morrow and others,claim they were operating outside of agency control.One strange incident involved an intelligence operative named Gary Underhill,who had served in World War II and was considered one of the top US experts onunconventional warfare. At the time of the assassination, Underhill performed“special assignments” for the CIA and was on close terms with officials of boththe agency and the Pentagon. Several days after the assassination, Underhillvisited friends in New Jersey. He was badly shaken and fearful. He said thatPresident Kennedy had been killed by a small group within the CIA and that hebelieved his life was in danger. A short time later, Underhill was found fatallyshot in his Washington apartment. His death was ruled a suicide although he wasshot in the left side of his head and a pistol was found in his left hand—and itwas well-known that Underhill was right-handed.There is also the very real possibility that the assassins who killed Kennedymay have had no direct link at all with Oswald and his Cuban contacts. Thisintriguing possibility—which could go far in explaining why none of the trailsleading backward from Oswald’s acquaintances in New Orleans seem to connectfirmly with the shooting in Dealey Plaza—became apparent several years ago withthe revelation of a French connection to the assassination.The French Connection to the Assassination [Contents.html#rsec47]In 1979 the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that many DealeyPlaza witnesses were correct in stating that at least one gunman fired onKennedy from the Grassy Knoll.While the committee said it could not identify the Grassy Knoll gunman, thesecond gunman may have been a premier French assassin with close contacts to theCIA, organized crime, and even an oblique connection with Jack Ruby. Accordingto evidence revealed in the late 1970s, more than one French assassin may havebeen operating in Dealey Plaza.Central to this possibility is CIA Document No. 632–796, which the agencyreleased in 1977 along with more than 3,000 other documents. Dated April 1,1964, and carrying the handwritten title “Jean Soutre’s Expulsion from US,” thehalf-page document stated:8. Jean SOUTRE aka [also known as] Michel Roux aka Michael Mertz—On March 5,[1964] the FBI advised that the French had [withheld] the Legal Attaché in Parisand also the [withheld] had queried the Bureau in New York City concerningsubject, stating that he had been expelled from the US at Fort Worth or Dallas18 hours after the assassination. He was in Fort Worth on the morning of 22November and in Dallas in the afternoon. The French believe that he was expelledto either Mexico or Canada. In January he received mail from a dentist namedAlderson. . . . Subject is believed to be identical with a Captain who is adeserter from the French Army and an activist in the OAS [a right-wing Frenchmilitant group]. The French are concerned because of De-Gaulle’s planned visitto Mexico. They would like to know the reason for his expulsion from the US andhis destination. Bureau files are negative and they are checking in Texas andwith the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service].And the government did check, first with the dentist, who was still practicingin Houston, Texas, in the 1980s. Dr. Lawrence M. Alderson told researchers thatFBI agents began watching him in early 1964. He said agents finally contactedhim and said they were trying to find the Frenchman “under any circumstancesunder any conditions.”Alderson said, “They felt that Jean knew who, or he himself had, assassinatedKennedy. And they wanted to know who in Washington had had him flown out ofDallas. And, to my knowledge, nobody ever found out or nobody knew.”Alderson said he had not seen the Frenchman since serving as a security officerwith him shortly after World War II. He confided that he was working for the CIAat the time. The dentist gave the following information about the Frenchman,Jean Soutre (pronounced “sweatra”):He’s a career soldier. From what I can gather, he was in the French undergroundmovement in Algiers. I do know he left the French Air Force. . . . I believe hewas in the Fourth French Air Force Headquarters in France. He was a veryprominent and upcoming French security officer. When I knew him, he was alieutenant. . . . I lived with him so I knew him quite well. He was very welleducated, very outgoing, forward, dynamic. He came from a very poor family. InFrance, you don’t have a thing if you’re from a poor family unless you have amilitary career behind you. So, he was very interested in his career and this iswhy I never did really understand why he left it. But, he very definitely left,I presume, his wife. I have not heard from her in many years. She was awell-to-do, beautiful woman from a Southern France wine family. The last I heardfrom her, she was the one who told me that he had left the French Army and hadgone underground trying to save Algeria. So, evidently, he was rather committed,or felt committed, to leave his career, which was the only career he had. Thenext time I heard of him, quite truthfully, was when the CIA, or the FBI rather,had me tailed for about two months following the assassination. . . . The lastcontact I had with the CIA was in France when I was working for him. So, theonly contact I had in this country was with the FBI.After providing a snapshot of his French friend, Alderson said Soutre in theearly 1950s was about twenty-five years old and spoke English, Spanish, andGerman without a trace of an accent.An FBI report stated that three persons named John Mertz, Irma Rio Mertz, andSara Mertz flew from Houston to Mexico City on November 23, 1963, according torecords of Pan American World Airways. The FBI report concluded, “These recordscontain no further identifying data regarding these individuals.”Although Soutre could have flown out of the country by private or even militaryaircraft, it is interesting to note the coincidental departure of the Mertzes ata time corresponding to that in the CIA document. After all, even the FBI reportnoted that Soutre also was known as Michel Roux and Michael Mertz.Today it is known that Roux and Mertz are the names of two real individuals,both of whom were connected to the shadowy world of intelligence work.The name “Mertz” crops up in the 1974 Pulitzer Prize–winning investigative bookThe Heroin Trail, compiled by the staff of Newsday. According to this book,Michael Victor Mertz was a World War II French Resistance hero and a captain inthe French secret service after the war. Mertz operated in Germany, Turkey, andMorocco under the cover of his military title. In April 1961, Mertz was orderedto penetrate the terrorist group Organisation de l’armée secrète (OAS), thesecret group fighting to keep Algeria a French possession. Reflecting themethods of Lee Oswald, Mertz posed as an OAS sympathizer and was arrested laterin 1961 for distributing pro-OAS leaflets. He was sent to an internment camp.There he worked his way into the highest levels of the OAS and was able to breakup a bomb plot against Charles de Gaulle.However, security work was not the only activity in which Mertz became involved.Even before saving de Gaulle, Mertz had become one of France’s biggest heroinsmugglers, according to Newsday, which cites numerous French police and courtrecords. It is known in intelligence circles that de Gaulle often turned hisback on drug smuggling, particularly if it involved people he was indebted tofor their work against either the Nazis or the OAS.One of Mertz’s contacts in both heroin smuggling and the French secret servicewas a man named Christian David, a petty hoodlum who had escaped a French prisonand later was recruited into French intelligence for use against the OAS.According to Newsday and other knowledgeable sources, David was one of the meninvolved in the 1965 murder of Moroccan opposition leader Mehdi Ben Barka.In 1972, Barka’s murder—which is still officially unsolved—was brought up whenDavid was arrested in Brazil and charged with being a member of a smuggling ringthat had imported more than 1,000 pounds of heroin into the United States over athree-year period.After his arrest in Brazil, David was extradited to the United States andsentenced to twenty years in prison for heroin smuggling. He didn’t stay therelong. In 1975, when the Senate Intelligence Committee began looking into theCIA’s “Executive Action” program, David was ordered extradited back to Franceand was taken out of the country.The committee was especially concerned with the agency’s Executive Actionprogram because it was established to commit assassinations. The program waspart of the operational arm of the CIA’s Technical Services Division and wascode-named ZR/RIFLE.Former CIA director Richard Helms spoke at length about ZR/RIFLE to thecommittee. Two members of the ZR/RIFLE team were identified by Helms only bytheir CIA cryptonyms—WI/ROGUE and QJ/WIN. According to evidence gathered by thecommittee, WI/ROGUE was a French Corsican, a stateless soldier of fortune and acriminal. This man approached QJ/WIN and attempted to recruit him into the CIA’sassassination program. Although it was never learned whether this recruitmenteffort was successful, there is evidence that it was.Declassified CIA notes concerning the ZR/RIFLE project state:4. Operational assets:(1.) Personnel: QJ/WIN is under written contract as a principal agent, with theprimary task of spotting agent candidates. QJ/WIN was first contacted in[deleted by CIA], in conjunction with an illegal narcotics operation into theUnited States. For a period of a year and a half, he was contacted sporadicallyby CIS Lucien Conein [who later became chief of foreign intelligence for theDrug Enforcement Agency] on behalf of the Bureau of Narcotics. Files of thisbureau reflect an excellent performance by QJ/WIN.Helms said this about QJ/WIN, “If you needed somebody to carry out murder, Iguess you had a man who might be prepared to carry it out.”Until the Senate hearings, the ZR/RIFLE program and its agents, WI/ROGUE andQJ/WIN, were among the CIA’s most closely guarded secrets. Several separatesources familiar with both intelligence operations and drug smuggling claim thatWI/ROGUE and Christian David are one and the same. This claim is furthersupported by David’s own admission of intelligence associations and by hisconvenient extradition to France in 1985.The association of David and Mertz, coupled with their descriptions andbackgrounds, which match those of the CIA agents, suggests that QJ/WIN wasMichael Victor Mertz, who also used the name Jean Soutre.If all this isn’t complicated enough, QJ/WIN even had a tenuous connection withJack Ruby—in the person of Thomas Eli Davis III.Tom Howard, Ruby’s first attorney, asked his client if there were anyone theprosecution might produce who could damage Ruby’s defense of momentary insanity.Ruby hesitantly came up with the name “Davis.” Ruby said Davis had firstapproached him about using some of Ruby’s strippers in pornographic movies, butthat later the two had become involved in gunrunning activities.The FBI told the Warren Commission they could not locate such a person. However,the CIA did—and still does—have a classified file on Thomas Eli Davis III.Veteran newsman Seth Kantor details Ruby’s connection to Davis in his book WhoWas Jack Ruby? Born to a respectable Texas rancher couple on August 27, 1936,Davis was discharged from the Army in 1958 and attended the University ofMichigan until he was asked to leave because of low grades.In June 1958, Davis entered a Detroit bank and handed a teller a note thatthreatened her life if she didn’t give him money. According to the teller, Davisthen said, “I can’t do it. I can’t do it,” then threw his thousand-dollar takeon the floor. He fled from the bank only to be caught by police a block away.Due to his family’s good reputation and his lack of a criminal record, Davisreceived five years of probation.While on probation, Davis obtained passport No. D236764, issued by the StateDepartment on January 31, 1963, in New Orleans, a feat almost impossible for aconvicted felon without highly placed and powerful help.Davis’s ensuing activities took him into the murky world of anti-Castrogunrunning, and it was here Davis met Ruby. Ruby told his attorney that Davishad come to one of his nightclubs and that he had intended to go into thegunrunning business with Davis on a regular basis. However, apparently Davis’sactivities were not limited to dealing with Cuban gunrunners.At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Davis was in North Africa, allegedlysetting up a deal to supply arms to the OAS. Less than a month later, he wasjailed in Tangiers in connection with the assassination.His wife told authorities that her husband was a soldier of fortune who hadoperated in such diverse countries as Indonesia, Algeria, and Cuba, and in themonths prior to his arrest they had traveled through London, Paris, and Madrid.According to correspondence between J. Edgar Hoover and the State Department,Moroccan security police detained Davis “because of a letter in his handwritingwhich referred in passing to Oswald and the Kennedy assassination.”Kantor wrote that evidence showed Davis was freed from jail through the effortsof QJ/WIN, “the code name given by the CIA to an unsavory foreign agent with anetwork of Mafia contacts.” Here could be the connection not only between Davisand the CIA, but between Davis and Mertz (if indeed Mertz was QJ/WIN).Through early 1963, Davis had contact with the anti-Castro Cubans, as confirmedby his wife and family. And he not only was in New Orleans at the same time asOswald in the summer of 1963, but once admitted to reporter George Carter thathe had used the name Oswald while in North Africa.Based on the two men’s similar statures, ages, and features, many researcherstoday believe that Davis may have posed as Oswald in the months leading up tothe assassination. Neither the Warren Commission nor the House Select Committeeon Assassinations chose to investigate the Davis story. Whatever informationDavis had was carried to his grave.Former Wise County, Texas, sheriff Eldon Moyers said that in September 1973Davis was attempting to steal copper wire from a construction site there when hecut into a 7,000-volt power line and was fatally electrocuted.Through his connection to QJ/WIN, Davis certainly was in the right circles to beinvolved in assassination attempts. According to testimony given to the SenateIntelligence Committee, QJ/WIN’s boss on the ZR/RIFLE team was the CIA’sWilliam Harvey. Harvey’s specialty was anti-Castro activities in general and theattempts to assassinate Castro in particular. Harvey, of course, was in contactwith John Roselli and Florida Mafia chief Santos Trafficante Jr.A reporter from Dallas once queried the FBI about Jean Soutre and his presencein Dallas in 1963 and was told that man was not Soutre, but another Frenchmannamed Michel Roux, whose name just happened to coincide with one of Soutre’saliases.However, the bureau, which could find nothing concerning Soutre/Mertz/Roux in1964, could not offer any substantiating documents to support its story aboutthe Soutre namesake.At the heart of this labyrinth of intelligence and mob intrigue is QJ/WIN, whoappears to have been Michael Victor Mertz.Soutre today has been located, working as the public-relations director for aFrench casino. He denied any inside knowledge of the assassination. Soutre didsuggest that Mertz, an old enemy, may have been in Dallas using his name.Virgil Bailey, an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, hastold Texas researchers he remembered being ordered to pick up a Frenchman inDallas at the time of the assassination. Bailey complied but in later yearscould not recall the man’s name. However, Bailey described the Frenchman toresearcher Gary Shaw as a man about forty-five years old with thin, grayinghair. In 1963, Soutre was about thirty-five years old and Roux was abouttwenty-five. Mertz, the agent connected to both intelligence and worldwideorganized crime, was about forty-five years old.The answers to questions raised by the French connection to the Kennedyassassination lie in locked files in Washington. But some assassinationresearchers feel the other gunman in Dealey Plaza just might have been theFrenchman known to the FBI as Michel Roux, to the French authorities as JeanSoutre, to the CIA as QJ/WIN, and to the international crime syndicate asMichael Victor Mertz.Further evidence of the French connection to the assassination came in 1988 whenLos Angeles author Steve J. Rivele claimed that after several years ofinvestigative work he had learned the names of three French gangsters who killedKennedy. He cited one source for his information as the imprisoned ChristianDavid. Rivele said David claimed to have been offered a contract to kill JFK bythe chief of the Marseilles Mafia, Meme Guérini. Years later Rivele stated, “Myown conviction at this point is that the contract probably originated withCarlos Marcello of New Orleans who placed it in Marseilles through his colleagueSanto Trafficante Jr., who had the closest relations with [Meme’s brother]Antoine Guérini.”The three alleged hit men were Sauveur Pironti, who in 1988 was living inMarseilles and denied any connection with the assassination; Lucien Sarti, whowas killed in Mexico in 1972; and a man named Bocognoni, who is believed to beliving in Central or South America.According to Rivele’s sources, Sarti wore a police uniform and fired from behindthe wooden picket fence on the Grassy Knoll. Pironti and Bocognoni reportedlyfired on Kennedy from a nearby building—either the old Dal-Tex Building orperhaps the Dallas County Records Building.Pironti, questioned by European news reporters after Rivele’s book The Murderersof John F. Kennedy was published in France in 1988, denied any involvement. Hisdenial was supported by French military authorities who said Pironti was servingat a sea post at the time of the assassination. However, later investigationfailed to substantiate this alibi.According to Rivele, David and another mobster, Michel Nicoli, claimed that LeeHarvey Oswald played no part in the assassination. Allegedly the threeassassins—Pironti, Sarti, and Bocognoni—were hired to kill Kennedy by the FrenchUnion Corse, the European branch of the international crime syndicate, on ordersfrom organized-crime figures in America. The trio of hit men flew to Mexico,where they were met at the Texas border by some Chicago mobsters who drove themto Dallas. After the assassination, the trio remained in a safe house for morethan a week and then were flown out of the country.Interestingly enough, when Rivele approached US government officials withDavid’s story, he was put in touch with Lucien Conein—the same man who wasworking with QJ/WIN, the shadowy CIA “asset.” Conein, known in Vietnam as “BlackLuigi,” often bragged about his connections with the Union Corse. Conein claimedhe was made an honorary member of this branch of the Sicilian Mafia afterserving with Corsican partisans as an officer in the OSS and the French ForeignLegion.It was Conein who, at the urging of Nixon aide Charles Colson, implicatedPresident Kennedy in the assassination of Vietnam’s Diem, telling news reportersthat Kennedy knew in advance of the plot to overthrow the Vietnamese president.Asked to comment on the French connection to Kennedy’s death, James H. Lesar,vice president of the Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington,DC, said, “I think that it’s sufficiently serious that the Department of Justiceand the US Secret Service should investigate it further.”Today it appears that no such investigation has been forthcoming, the US mediahas paid little attention to Christian David’s admissions, and Rivele reportedlywent into hiding after receiving death threats. Today he blogs on the Internet.[images/line.jpg]The agency’s suspicious activities in Mexico City; the memos of October 1963;Morrow’s purchase of Mannlicher-Carcano rifles; and the ZR/RIFLE program, whichmay have included the French criminal Christian David, suggest foreknowledge ofthe assassination within the CIA.In an October 3, 1963, story in the New York Times, Richard Starnes of theScripps-Howard newspapers quoted a “high United States source” in Vietnam ascomparing the CIA’s growth to a “malignancy,” which Starnes’s high-level sourcewas not certain even the White House could still control. The official added,“If the United States ever experiences [an attempt at a coup to overthrow thegovernment] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon [as the agency]represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.”Even Kennedy’s successor once voiced suspicion of the spy agency. According tothe Washington Post, Marvin Watson of President Johnson’s White House staff in1967 confided to an FBI official who wrote that “[Johnson] was now convincedthere was a plot in connection with the assassination. Watson stated thePresident felt that CIA had had something to do with this plot.”Naturally, the CIA long has maintained innocence in the assassination and theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that while the agency was“deficient in its collection and sharing of information both prior to andsubsequent to the assassination,” the CIA was not involved.Many researchers today are not as certain as the House committee, although, mostagree that the CIA—as a government agency—probably did not plan or authorizeKennedy’s death."},{"pageContent":"G-Men (J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI and the Secret Service) [Contents.html#rch8]Anyone making a serious study of the JFK assassination must take a long, hardlook at the FBI and the Secret Service. The former—as we now know—monopolizedthe investigation of the tragedy while the latter failed to prevent it.The contacts between accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and the FBI are many andtroubling. No fewer than seven FBI agents were associated with thetwenty-four-year-old Oswald during the year and a half between his return fromRussia and the assassination.While the bureau has been especially sensitive about the JFK assassination, italso has been unintentionally helpful. During the past five decades, more than 5million pages of documents regarding the assassination have been released by thegovernment, often forced by Freedom of Information Act suits. The occasionalnuggets of information buried in the raw ore of these documents, most from theFBI, have helped piece together aspects of the case.Increasingly the bureau has been called to task for its handling of the JFKassassination. At least two government panels have chided the bureau forinadequacies in its assassination investigation. The House Select Committee onAssassinations concluded that the bureau “failed to investigate the possibilityof a conspiracy to assassinate the President.” Likewise, the Senate IntelligenceCommittee chastised the bureau for shoddy work in the assassinationinvestigation. Although the Warren Commission spent several pages of its reportsuggesting ways to improve the performance of the Secret Service, no criticismwas leveled at the FBI. This was not surprising since the Commission’s wholeinvestigation was based on J. Edgar Hoover’s initial findings.Ironically, it was government corruption that prompted the creation of the FBIin the first place. Just after the turn of the twentieth century, there was agrowing demand in Washington to combat the “public-be-damned” attitude of thegiant trusts—later to become multinational corporations—and corruption within anumber of federal agencies. Such abuses were the province of the Department ofJustice, which Congress had never seen fit to equip with investigators. Wheninvestigations were required, treasury agents were called in on a temporarybasis.In 1907, despite objections in Congress, attorney general Charles J. Bonapartewent ahead with plans to create an investigative force, stating, “A Departmentof Justice with no force of permanent police in any form under its control isassuredly not fully equipped for its work.” With the approval of presidentTheodore Roosevelt, Bonaparte issued an order dated July 26, 1908, creating aninvestigative agency within the Justice Department. Less than one year later,Bonaparte’s successor, Attorney General George W. Wickersham, gave the newagency a permanent position and a name—the Bureau of Investigation.But the new bureau could enforce only federal crimes and—outside ofcounterfeiting—there were hardly any federal crimes at that time. The bureau hadlittle to do.But in 1910 Congress, pressured by a public that was shocked and outraged bypress accounts of worldwide prostitution, or “white slave” rings, unanimouslypassed the White Slave Traffic Act. This law became known as the Mann Act afterits sponsor, representative James Robert Mann of Illinois. The law gave federalagents authority in any case in which a woman was taken across state or nationalboundaries for immoral purposes.The Mann Act was loosely written, applying to female criminals as well asinnocent sex “slaves.” In effect, it gave the fledgling bureau an excuse tointervene in any case in which a woman involved in criminal activity crossedstate lines.World War I boosted the bureau into national prominence. During 1914 and 1915explosions, fires, and other acts of sabotage occurred at several war plants.American public opinion slowly began shifting from neutrality to animositytoward Germany. The pace of this shift quickened in January 1917, when Germanyresumed unrestricted submarine warfare on American shipping. Congress declaredwar against the Central Powers, led by Germany, on April 6 and president WoodrowWilson ordered the bureau to address wartime issues.Wisely noting that all Americans of German descent could not be interned for theduration of the war, Wilson nevertheless required more than one million “enemyaliens” to register. The bureau, which had only three hundred agents by then,was expected to enforce this presidential edict.The nation suddenly became aware of the danger of spies, and a full-blown spyscare swept across the land—much of the suspicion directed at labor unions andanarchists. Aided by a group of private vigilantes called the AmericanProtective League, which eventually numbered more than a quarter millionmembers, the bureau began to expand but quickly dropped association with theleague, which was accused of overzealous activities and intimidating laborunions.The next year a bomb exploded at the home of the new attorney general, A.Mitchell Palmer, killing the two bombers. Palmer was incensed and immediatelytook action. He replaced bureau director Alexander Bielaski with William J.Flynn, a former chief of the Secret Service. Palmer also created a GeneralIntelligence Division under the command of his twenty-four-year-old specialassistant who had come to the bureau fresh out of the George WashingtonUniversity Law School two years before—J. Edgar Hoover.The Top G-man [Contents.html#rsec48]No one man has held so much power for so long in the history of the UnitedStates as John Edgar Hoover.In the 1950s, Hoover was an honors-encrusted hero, hailed as the foremostdefender of American freedom and democracy. By the 1970s, he was being likenedto Heinrich Himmler, Hitler’s dreaded SS commander.By the 1980s, knowledge of FBI abuses under Hoover’s leadership had becomewidespread, although the major news media—perhaps recalling the veneration ithad lavished on Hoover for so long—seemed reluctant to spotlight his darkeractivities.The truth of Hoover’s place in the still-untold history of modern-day Americalies in the man’s background and motivations. One reason so little is knownabout him is that for so long everything printed about Hoover was either aproduct of FBI public relations or, at least, was approved by Hoover or asubordinate. To get any cooperation from the Bureau—a necessity for obtainingany information involving a federal investigation—news reporters were forced tostay on Hoover’s good side. Any story criticizing the director was an excuse toplace the writer on the bureau’s list of people to be ignored.Hoover was born on January 1, 1895, five years before the twentieth centurybegan. He was the youngest of four children. Born in Washington, DC, Hooverrarely left the city in his entire life. Until her death in 1938, he lived withhis mother in the family home at 413 Seward Square. Afterward he continuedliving there with his constant companion and the FBI’s associate director, ClydeTolson.His father, Dickerson N. Hoover, was a minor bureaucrat who served as chief ofthe Coast and Geodetic Survey’s printing division. His mother, Annie M.Scheitlin Hoover, was a plump housewife who faithfully instilled Americanmiddle-class virtues and Lutheran Christianity in her children.As a schoolboy delivering groceries, young Hoover discovered the quicker hedelivered, the more trips he could make, which meant more money. He soon wasgiven the nickname “Speed.” Active in athletics, Hoover was once hit in the noseby a baseball—the basis of his bulldog-like appearance. After graduating fromWashington’s Central High School, Hoover got a job as a clerk in the Library ofCongress. At night he began attending George Washington University Law School,where he obtained his law degree in 1916 and a master of law in 1917.With the world at war, there was frantic activity in the Department of Justice.Jobs were opening up every day. On July 26, 1917, Hoover joined the departmentand was placed in the enemy alien registration section. Earning a reputation asa diligent and efficient worker, Hoover soon became an assistant to the attorneygeneral, who placed him in charge of the General Intelligence Division. Soonafter taking charge of the division, Hoover was instructed by Attorney GeneralA. Mitchell Palmer to study subversive groups within the United States. Hooverwent at the project with zeal.As Hoover studied the background of communism, he came to a studied conclusionthat in 1919 was used to deport about 3,000 American citizens:American communists supported the Third International which was run by Sovietcommunists who advocated the violent overthrow of the US Government. ThereforeAmerican communists were advocating the violent overthrow of the government andcould be deported as “enemy aliens.”This marked the beginning of the infamous “Palmer raids,” in which Hooverprepared the legal cases. Early in 1920, at the orders of Attorney GeneralPalmer, the bureau launched a series of raids on communist meeting places inthirty-three cities, rounding up more than 2,500 aliens. These raids drew bothpraise and condemnation. Through the years, Hoover continually used thecommunist threat to great personal advantage, even putting his name on thepopular book Masters of Deceit, which helped fan the fires of the 1950scommunist scare.Was there any real threat from American communists? In his resignation letter toHoover, William C. Sullivan, at one time third-ranking official at the FBI,wrote:In the mid-Forties when the membership of the Party was about 80,000 and it hadmany front organizations, you publicized this widely month in and month out. Infact it was far too widely publicized to the point where you caused a communistscare in the nation which was entirely unwarranted. . . . I am just as opposedto communism as you but I knew then and I know now that it was not the dangeryou claimed it was and that it never warranted the huge amounts of thetaxpayer’s dollars spent upon it. . . . What happened when the Communist Partywent into a rapid decline? You kept the scare campaign going just the same forsome years. However, when the membership figures kept dropping lower and loweryou instructed us not to give them to the public any more and not even to theJustice Department. . . . At the time of my leaving the Bureau [1971] . . . themembership figures of the Communist Party are down to an amazing 2,800 in anation of over 200 million people and you still conceal this from the people.It has been said that of the small number of members of the Communist Party inthose days, almost half were FBI informers. But Hoover never let the facts standin the way of his campaign to eradicate communism, even if it meant neglectingone of the true menaces to America—organized crime.In the forty-eight years that Hoover controlled the United States’ only nationalpolice organization, he served eight presidents and outlasted more than a dozenattorneys general. Hoover also was close to leaders of the Nazi-dominatedInternational Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) prior to World War II andwas named vice president of Interpol in 1946.Organized-crime investigator Peter Maas has reported that prior to RobertKennedy’s becoming attorney general, only four FBI agents in the New York officewere assigned to organized crime and they were kept busy with in-office“bookkeeping” duties. Yet about four hundred agents were on the streets of thecity searching out communists.As late as January 1962, Hoover was on record as saying, “No single individualor coalition of racketeers dominates organized crime across the nation.” As withthe communist threat, Hoover was not telling the truth.Shortly after the aborted mob conference at Apalachin in 1957, Sullivan andother top FBI officials prepared a monograph on the Mafia that was sent to thetop twenty-five government officials concerned with law enforcement. Learning ofthis, an angry Hoover recalled all twenty-five copies and had them destroyed. Hedenounced the monograph as “baloney,” and this report was never heard of again.After Mafia thug Joe Valachi was brought to Washington by attorney generalRobert Kennedy’s Justice Department for testimony before a Senate committee,Hoover was forced to grudgingly admit to the existence of an organized-crimestructure in this nation. Why did Hoover act like there was no such thing as theMafia when there was so much evidence to the contrary?In his book The Bureau, Sullivan wrote:[Hoover] didn’t want to tackle organized crime. He preferred his agents to spendtheir time on quick, easy cases—he wanted results, predictable results whichproduced the statistics Hoover thrived on. . . . Investigating the Mafiapromised to be more difficult than rounding up juvenile auto thieves. Organizedcrime is far more complicated: the Mafia runs legitimate businesses as a frontfor their illegal operations. Mafioso are rich and can afford the best lawyers,while we have to use government lawyers, some of whom are excellent, some ofwhom aren’t worth a damn. And the Mafia is powerful, so powerful that entirepolice forces and even a mayor’s office can be under Mafia control. That’s whyHoover was afraid to let us tackle it. He was afraid we’d show up poorly.There were also other considerations. Most people now accept that Hoover’s lackof interest in organized crime was a result of the blackmail threat due to hishomosexuality. According to Don Fulsome, who covered the Nixon White House forUnited Press International, “J. Edgar Hoover was in the hip pocket of America’sgodfathers, reputedly because they had pictorial proof of his homosexuality.”This referred to persistent rumors that the mob had photographs of Hoover incompromising situations with Tolson as well as wearing a pink ballerina’s tutu.Hoover was well-known for his ingratiating attitude toward Washingtonpoliticians. The more powerful the politician, the more Hoover tried to befriendhim—and control him, thanks to the voluminous files Hoover had accumulatedthrough the years.One thing is certain: by the time of World War II, the FBI’s vast power wascentered solely in J. Edgar Hoover.But if blame must be assigned for this situation, it may, as argued by TomWicker, associate editor of the New York Times, be laid on the American public.Wicker wrote:The public—gulled, it is true, by the Bureau’s incessant propaganda—until recentyears loved it all; and what considerable percentage of voters Washingtonbelieved were still devoted to J. Edgar Hoover at his death was suggested by thePresident’s funeral oration and by Congress’s decision that his body should liein state, where Lincoln and Kennedy had lain. There was little or no outcry whenthe Director, guardian of liberty, spoke up for Joe McCarthy, called MartinLuther King a liar and for years singlehandedly held up congressional passage ofa consular treaty with the Soviet Union. There was always a radio audience for“The FBI in Peace and War” and the G-man movies to which the Director invariablylent “technical assistance” and his seal of approval—as long as they picturedhis men on the side of the angels. For decades, his turgid and moralisticarticles appeared with the regularity of the seasons in “Reader’s Digest” and“American” magazines, and publishers took turns presenting his self-aggrandizingbooks to the waiting public. If J. Edgar Hoover passed eventually beyond thenormal restraints of office, the American public seemed to view this processhappily, and with a sense of gratitude.[images/line.jpg]Public criticism, however, grew over the Palmer raids of communist meetingplaces. Federal agents were charged with unconstitutional searches and seizures,individual rights violations, and even using agents provocateur.After hearing testimony of warrantless arrests and prisoners being heldincommunicado, one federal judge declared, “It may . . . be observed that a mobis a mob, whether made up of government officials acting under instructions fromthe Department of Justice, or of criminals, loafers, and the vicious classes.”Later a Senate committee looked into the raids, but divided on its views of theoperation and failed to reach a consensus. It was the first—andlast—congressional investigation of the FBI.Chastised by the complaints over the Palmer raids, the Justice Department sawits morale go from bad to worse. In an effort to demonstrate leadership in thismoral crisis, newly elected president Calvin Coolidge appointed Harlan FiskeStone, a former dean of the Columbia University Law School, attorney general.Soon after taking control of what had become known as the “Department of EasyVirtue,” Stone named twenty-nine-year-old Hoover acting director of the bureau.Hoover moved rapidly to restore respect for the bureau, which was in real dangerof being disbanded due to the years of problems and criticism. His actionsproduced immediate results. Asked whether one of his agents would investigatethe activities of a senator’s son, Hoover once stated, “This Bureau cannot beused for partisan purposes.”Backed solidly by Stone, Hoover rehabilitated the bureau’s image.Over the next fifteen years, Hoover moved the bureau from a few hundred unarmedinvestigators to a full-fledged national police agency. And all the while, hekept an eye open for favorable public relations opportunities. By the early1930s, Prohibition had propelled crime into the national spotlight and Hooverwas there to share the glory. During the heyday of Bonnie and Clyde and the MaBarker Gang, hardly a day passed that Hoover wasn’t being quoted in the nation’spress. His legend grew.In the early 1930s, Hoover, a staunch Republican, was very cautious about hismoves within Franklin Roosevelt’s Democratic administration.By 1933, kidnapping was added to the list of crimes under the jurisdiction ofthe FBI due to the public clamor over the abduction of aviation pioneer CharlesLindbergh’s infant son. This list grew longer the next year, with the additionof killing or assaulting a federal officer, fleeing across state lines, andextortion involving interstate commerce. By 1935, bureau agents had the power togo beyond investigation. They were allowed to serve warrants and subpoenas, tomake seizures and arrests, and to carry arms. The bureau had become the verything that Hoover had often spoken against—a national police force. Also thatyear, the word “federal” was added to the bureau’s name, and soon the initialsFBI were well-known all over the world.By the beginning of World War II, the FBI boasted an Identification Divisionwith thousands of fingerprint records, a complete and up-to-date laboratory, anda National Police Academy for training state and local law-enforcement officers.Even today it is considered the peak of a lawman’s career to be selected fortraining at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia. And Hoover made use of this,too. According to former assistant director Sullivan, “Hoover felt that thealumni of the FBI training course were his men. Thanks to this network ofFBI-trained police officers, we had a private and frequently helpful line tomost city and state police organizations throughout the country.”Hoover also used the FBI Academy’s prestige against perceived enemies. On theday of the JFK assassination, a shocked Dallas FBI agent named James Hosty toldDallas police lieutenant Jack Revill that Lee Harvey Oswald was a communistknown to the FBI, and that the bureau had information that Oswald was capable ofcommitting the assassination. Since all government agencies were saying they hadno knowledge of Oswald, this story was a bombshell.As a result of this conversation, Dallas police chief Jesse Curry told TV newsreporters that the FBI was aware of Oswald but had not informed the Dallaspolice. When challenged to prove his charge by the head of the Dallas FBIoffice, Curry qualified his statement by saying he had no personal knowledge ofthe issue. But the damage had been done.Until Curry’s retirement in 1966, Hoover conducted a vendetta against the Dallaspolice, according to FBI documents released in 1980. The documents show thatunder orders from Hoover, FBI officials were prohibited from conducting trainingcourses for Dallas police, and policemen from that city were not invited toattend the FBI Academy, claiming lack of manpower.In January 1966 Dallas mayor Erik Jonsson visited Hoover in Washington. Afterhearing Hoover’s complaints against Curry, Jonsson told the petulant director hewould “immediately instruct the city manager to have a stern talk” with thepolice chief. Curry resigned less than a month after the Jonsson-Hoover meetingand within weeks, Dallas police were again receiving FBI training.Hoover did not gain such immense power overnight. After turning his bureau intoan anticrime force, he began to look into other areas. Beginning with secretmeetings between President Roosevelt and Hoover in the summer of 1936, thebureau began moving quietly into intelligence gathering. In 1939, on the eve ofWorld War II, the bureau was directed to investigate espionage, sabotage, andviolations of neutrality regulations. It also apprehended draft evaders andenemy aliens. It should be noted that Hoover was one of the few governmentofficials who opposed the relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans asa violation of their civil rights.This new authority marked the beginning of this nation’s multiagencyintelligence establishment and marked a period of extraordinary growth for thebureau. The FBI, which boasted only 391 agents in 1933, counted nearly 5,000 bythe end of the war.During the war, the FBI was called upon to gather intelligence on activitiesdetrimental to US interests in South America. And while this activity wasordered terminated with the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947,the FBI even today retains large offices in Mexico City, Brasilia, Ottawa,Vienna, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Baghdad, among many other cities.Also during the war, Hoover’s path crossed that of a young naval intelligenceofficer with unexpected and long-term repercussions. The FBI had been snoopingafter a suspected Nazi agent, a beautiful woman named Inga Arvad who hadattended the wedding of Germany’s Field Marshal Hermann Goering and met withAdolf Hitler. A former Miss Denmark, she had no trouble attracting young men inwartime Washington. One of these men was naval Ensign John F. Kennedy.Hoover’s FBI wiretapped an apartment shared by Kennedy and “Inga binga,” as hecalled his paramour, and picked up the sounds of sexual play. They also pickedup a few remarks by Kennedy concerning sensitive security matters. After boththe Navy and his father had been alerted to the danger presented by Kennedy’sinvolvement with a suspected agent, young Kennedy was quickly transferred to theSouth Pacific. It was there, of course, that Kennedy led the survivors of PT-109back to safety, thus becoming a war hero and helping to launch his politicalcareer—all thanks to the diligent J. Edgar Hoover. It could thus be argued—withgreat irony—that it was Hoover who actually set young Kennedy on the course thatended in Dallas.After World War II, FBI intelligence activities increased, thanks to theanticommunist hysteria of the Cold War years. In fact, it was the FBI thatlaunched senator Joseph McCarthy on his ill-fated anticommunist crusade. In1950, a one-hundred-page FBI document alleging communist infiltration of the USgovernment was leaked to a military intelligence officer with instructions topass it along to the Jewish American League Against Communism. The leagueoffered the document to McCarthy, who was further encouraged to fight communismby Father Edmund A. Walsh, vice president of Georgetown University and ananticommunist author.Assistant FBI Director Sullivan wrote, “We gave McCarthy all we had, but all wehad were fragments, nothing could prove his allegations.”While Hoover always claimed that information the bureau collected was never tobe released to unauthorized persons, it was a rule that he bent for friends. In1948, when New York governor Thomas Dewey ran for president against HarryTruman, Hoover secretly agreed to put the bureau’s resources at his disposal,hoping that he would be made attorney general upon Dewey’s election. Dewey lost.In 1954, vice president Richard Nixon was able to obtain information in FBIfiles to use in his attack against representative Robert L. Condon ofCalifornia.It is well-known now that Hoover deliberately leaked derogatory material on Dr.Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s as a part of COINTELPRO, Hoover’s secretcounterintelligence program.It was this ability, first to gather information and then to control it, thatgave Hoover his extraordinary power. Former assistant FBI director Sullivanwrote:Hoover was always gathering damaging material on Jack Kennedy, which thePresident, with his active social life, seemed more than willing to provide. Wenever put any technical surveillance on JFK, but whatever came up wasautomatically funneled directly to Hoover. I was sure he was saving everythinghe had on Kennedy, and on Martin Luther King, Jr., too, until he could unload itall and destroy them both. He kept this kind of explosive material in hispersonal files, which filled four rooms on the fifth floor of headquarters.Perhaps the presence of these files, which still held information on Kennedy andInga Arvad, explains why reappointing Hoover was one of JFK’s first actionsafter becoming president.It has been reported that Hoover’s personal and confidential files weredestroyed soon after his death by Tolson and Hoover’s faithful secretary, HelenGandy.Hoover’s reappointment by Kennedy certainly wasn’t due to Hoover’s politics. ARepublican who liked to boast that he had never voted, Hoover had quietly helpedNixon as much as possible during the 1960 campaign. According to Sullivan,Hoover did his best to keep the news media supplied with anti-Kennedy stories.Hoover’s methods of ingratiating himself both to presidents and attorneysgeneral he served have been well documented. He would send them letters marked“Top Secret, Eyes Only” filled with juicy tidbits of gossip about congressmenand political enemies. Most presidents disdained this practice, but two—LyndonB. Johnson and Richard Nixon—seemed to enjoy the unusual channel of information.Nixon and Hoover were GOP allies from the days when Nixon was a representativefrom California. Sullivan noted, “I spent many days preparing material based onresearch taken from FBI files that I knew was going straight from Hoover tocongressman Nixon, material which Nixon used in speeches, articles andinvestigations.”Nixon had been rejected as an FBI agent in 1937—Hoover later told him that thebureau wasn’t hiring at the time, but the agent who rejected him reported thatNixon was “lacking in aggression.” Despite this, Nixon and Hoover remained closefriends. Hoover was a regular dinner guest at the Nixon White House in lateryears.Following the assassination, Lyndon Johnson had a strong right-hand man inHoover. According to Sullivan, Johnson—worried that Robert Kennedy might make agrab for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1964—asked Hoover for aspecial security team of FBI men, headed by Cartha D. DeLoach. Sullivan wrote,“Ostensibly, the agents would be there to guard against threats to thePresident, but this security force was actually a surveillance team, acontinuation of the FBI’s surveillance on Martin Luther King in Atlantic City.By keeping track of King, LBJ could also keep track of RFK.”Johnson and Hoover had much in common, according to Sullivan. He wrote, “Johnsonand Hoover had their mutual fear and hatred of the Kennedys in common—and more.As neighbors in Washington since the days when Johnson was a senator from Texas,they had been frequent dinner guests in each other’s homes.”Johnson cemented his friendship with—and perhaps his power—over Hoover inJanuary 1964, less than two months after Kennedy’s assassination. In a ceremonyconducted in the White House Rose Garden, Johnson praised his friend Hoover as“a hero to millions of decent citizens, and an anathema to evil men.”After noting Hoover’s accomplishments through the years, Johnson said:Edgar, the law says that you must retire next January when you reach your 70thbirthday, and I know you wouldn’t want to break the law. But the nation cannotafford to lose you. Therefore, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vestedin the President, I have today signed an Executive Order exempting you fromcompulsory retirement for an indefinite period of time.Although this order was renewed each year, it was tantamount to installingHoover as FBI director for life since it would have required a subsequentexecutive order to rescind this action. Such action put an end topre-assassination rumors in DC that Kennedy would use the mandatory retirementlimit to remove Hoover after the 1964 election.This extraordinary action coupled with the timing—with both the WarrenCommission and the FBI’s assassination investigation just getting into fullswing—has led more suspicious assassination researchers to suspect that thispresidential exemption was a partial payment to Hoover for his lack of apenetrating probe into Kennedy’s death.Shortly after this event, Hoover replaced Courtney Evans as the bureau’s WhiteHouse liaison with Cartha DeLoach, who had been quite intimate with Johnsonsince his early days in the Senate. DeLoach figured prominently in theassassination investigation and revealed in the 1970s that Johnson had begun tosuspect that the CIA had something to do with Kennedy’s death, ignoring themalfeasance of the FBI.According to Sullivan, once Johnson assumed the powers of the presidency, hisrelationship with the trusty Hoover began to change. He wrote:The Director was over 65 by that time, past retirement age for federalemployees, and he stayed in office only because of a special waiver whichrequired the President’s signature each year. That waiver put Hoover right inJohnson’s pocket. With that leverage, Johnson began to take advantage of Hoover,using the Bureau as his personal investigative arm. His never-ending requestswere usually political, and sometimes illegal. . . . And Hoover hot-footed it toJohnson’s demands . . . he found himself very much in the back seat, almost acaptive of the President.In addressing the relationship between Hoover and Johnson, biographer RichardGid Powers wrote, “Because of the extraordinary rapport between them, there wasno service Hoover would refuse Johnson, no matter how far removed it might befrom his law enforcement or domestic intelligence responsibilities.”Some researchers have darkly hinted that LBJ may have had more leverage onHoover than simply securing his job as director—that it may have had somethingto do with the JFK assassination.There can be no doubt that Hoover had an abiding and intense hatred for bothJohn and Robert Kennedy, because of their politics, their associates, theirpersonal lives, and their style. Sullivan recalled hearing Clyde Tolson,Hoover’s associate director, confidant, and roommate, once say, “Goddamn theKennedys. First there was Jack, now there is Bobby, and then Teddy. We’ll havethem on our necks until the year 2000.” Hoover reportedly nodded in agreement.This hatred for the Kennedys makes the bureau’s numerous contacts with LeeHarvey Oswald all the more suspicious. The FBI was involved with Oswald startingwhen he went to Russia. Then there was Hoover’s 1960 memo to the StateDepartment, warning “there is a possibility that an impostor is using Oswald’sbirth certificate.” Very much aware of Oswald and even suspecting that someonemay have been posing as the ex-Marine, the FBI attempted to keep tabs on Oswaldafter his attempted defection to Russia.On April 27, 1960, John W. Fain, a resident FBI agent in Fort Worth, interviewedRobert Oswald concerning his brother’s activities in the Soviet Union. The olderOswald said his whole family was shocked at his brother’s behavior and that Leehad never had any sympathy for or connection with communism before his trip toRussia. Fain also interviewed Marguerite Oswald the next day concerning a $25money order she had tried to send to her son.Apparently the FBI was not the only US agency with an active interest in Oswald.On July 3, 1961, more than a year before Oswald arrived back home from Russia,Fain prepared another report on Oswald. This report is rich in detail ofOswald’s life history as well as his activities in the Soviet Union. Accordingto this document, much of the information on Oswald came from the districtoffice of naval intelligence in New Orleans.Armed with this naval intelligence information, Fain and FBI special agent TomCarter requested a meeting with Oswald at the Fort Worth FBI office on June 25,1962, less than two weeks after the Oswalds arrived back in Fort Worth fromRussia. According to their report, Oswald told of flying home with Marina andtheir child, but he failed to mention the stopover in Atlanta. He also told ofborrowing $435 to get home, but he declined to talk about why he went to Russia,saying only that he didn’t want to relive the past.The agents said Oswald “exhibited an impatient and arrogant attitude” during theinterview. He also denied that he had attempted to renounce his Americancitizenship and that he had offered the Russians any military information.Interestingly, Oswald did assure the FBI agents that “in the event he iscontacted by Soviet Intelligence under suspicious circumstances or otherwise, hewill promptly communicate with the FBI.” Could this agreement have been thebeginning of a special relationship between Oswald and the bureau?Oswald’s next recorded contact with the bureau was on August 16, 1962, when Fainand Special Agent Arnold Brown approached him near his home at 2703 MercedesStreet in Fort Worth, where he and Marina had lived for about a month. Believingthat Oswald had been “evasive” during his first interview, Fain had decided tocontact him again, only this time the agents sat with Oswald in a parked carnear his home. Fain explained that they didn’t want to embarrass Oswald in frontof his wife, so they declined his offer to come into the house.The more suspicious researchers view this unusual meeting in a car as a timewhen the FBI may have begun to recruit Oswald as an informant. But according tothe agents, Oswald once again denied any misconduct in Russia, denied that hehad tried to defect, and denied that any Soviet intelligence personnel had evertried to contact him or offer any “deals.” Once again, Oswald agreed to contactthe FBI if anyone connected with Soviet intelligence tried to meet with him.After satisfying themselves that Oswald was not a member of the AmericanCommunist Party, Fain and Brown marked the Oswald file closed. Fain retired fromthe bureau on October 29, 1962.However, that was not to be the last contact between Oswald and the bureau.After arriving in New Orleans in the spring of 1963, Oswald became the object ofyet another security investigation by the FBI. This time the special agent incharge of Oswald’s file was Milton R. Kaack, who prepared a detailed reportdated October 31, 1963, on Oswald, his background, and his New Orleansactivities.But the strangest contact between Oswald and the bureau came on August 10, 1963,the day after his arrest for disturbing the peace while handing out Fair Playfor Cuba Committee leaflets on a New Orleans street corner.Did Oswald Work for the FBI? [Contents.html#rsec49]If Oswald indeed participated in spy work, particularly for the United States,it was most likely known to the FBI. What better prospect to recruit as aninformant than an experienced American agent with a procommunist background or“cover”?It is telling to note that following his arrest in New Orleans, Oswald, styledas a malcontent loner who tried to defect to Russia, should ask to meet with anFBI agent rather than a lawyer.The day after Oswald’s arrest in New Orleans for disturbing the peace was aSaturday. The weekend is hardly a time for a quick FBI response to the requestof a police prisoner jailed for creating a disturbance, a minor infraction. Yetspecial agent John Quigley soon arrived at the New Orleans police station andmet with Oswald for an hour and a half.The five-page report of that meeting written by Quigley reads like acomprehensive report on the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Oswald gave the agentbackground information on himself, then detailed his activities since coming toNew Orleans, including his attempt to form a Fair Play for Cuba Committeechapter and the squabble between Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans.Quigley, who told the Warren Commission he had never heard of Oswald until thatSaturday, had a faulty memory. He later admitted that on April 18, 1961, he hadreviewed Oswald’s Navy file at the nearby US Naval Air Station in Algiers,Louisiana, at the request of the Dallas FBI office.Quigley could give the Commission no reason why Oswald had wanted to see an FBIagent in 1963, but an FBI document released in 1977 may give a clue. ThereQuigley reports being contacted by a New Orleans police intelligence officer who“said that Oswald was desirous of seeing an agent and supplying to himinformation with regard to his activities with the FPCC in New Orleans.” Againthis statement, along with the detailed description Oswald gave of hisactivities, seems to indicate that Oswald was trying to make some sort ofreport. In this “report,” Oswald continually mentions the fictitious head of theNew Orleans FPCC, A. J. Hidell, saying that he had talked with Hidell severaltimes by telephone but had never met him. Asked for Hidell’s number, Oswald saidhe couldn’t remember it.In all, at least ten FBI agents filed affidavits with the Warren Commissionstating unequivocally that Lee Harvey Oswald was never an informant for thebureau. Could they have said the same for “Harvey Lee Oswald,” or “A. J.Hidell”? During his Warren Commission testimony, Quigley made an odd slip of thetongue, referring to Oswald as “Harvey Lee Oswald” until corrected by assistantcounsel Samuel Stern. It is well-known that FBI informants, and even agentsthemselves, often use code, or cover names.It is interesting to note that J. Gordon Shanklin and Kyle G. Clark, the FBIsupervisors in the Dallas office, mentioned only that no payment was made toOswald for information in their affidavits. They did not specifically denyknowledge of Oswald as an informant, as had the other agents in theiraffidavits.Other circumstances of Oswald’s New Orleans stay also indicate the possibilityof a relationship with the FBI. In 1975, a New Orleans bar owner, Orest Pena,claimed to have seen Oswald in his Habana Bar in the company of both Cubans andFBI agent Warren De Brueys.Pena, himself an FBI informant and a Cuban exile associated with the CIA-backedCuban Revolutionary Council, said he remembered Oswald as a man who came intohis bar with a Cuban and ordered a lemonade, then vomited it up. He said he sawOswald together with De Brueys and other “government agents” on severaloccasions.Pena also said that about ten days before he was to testify before the WarrenCommission, De Brueys threatened him, saying, “If you ever talk anything aboutme, I will get rid—I’ll get rid of your ass.”Pena added that Commission staff counsel Wesley J. Liebeler did not let himspeak freely, so he decided to keep his mouth shut. Agent De Brueys denied bothallegations and the House Select Committee on Assassinations chose to believehim.Then there is the strange story of William S. Walter, who served as a securityclerk for the New Orleans FBI office in 1963. Like CIA paymaster James Wilcott,Walter was a minor functionary who claimed to have seen the wrong things. Whenhe tried to tell what he knew, he found himself facing an official stone wall.Testifying to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Walter said he wason duty the day that Quigley interviewed Oswald in the New Orleans policestation. In response to Quigley’s request for a file check on Oswald that day,he said he found that the New Orleans FBI office maintained both a security andan informant file on Oswald. However, Quigley told the committee that there wasno informant file on Oswald, only the security file.Walter’s story apparently was echoed by Dallas FBI agent Will Hayden Griffin.According to a 1964 FBI memorandum, Griffin reportedly told people that Oswaldwas definitely an FBI informant and that files in Washington would prove it.Griffin later denied making any such comment.But Walter had other information for the committee. He claimed that while he wasserving night duty in the FBI office on November 17, 1963, the New Orleans FBIoffice received a teletype from FBI headquarters warning against a possibleassassination attempt on Kennedy during the coming trip to Dallas on November22. Walter said he was alone in the New Orleans FBI office in the early morninghours when the teletype came through. He said it was headed “urgent,” marked tothe attention of all special agents, and signed “Director.”The thrust of the teletype was that the bureau had received information that a“militant revolutionary group” might attempt to assassinate Kennedy on hisproposed trip to Dallas. It went on to say that all receiving offices should“immediately contact all CI’s [confidential or criminal informants], PCI’s[potential confidential or criminal informants], local racial and hate-groupinformants and determine if any basis for threat. Bureau should be kept advisedof all developments by teletype.”Walter said he telephoned the special agent in charge, Harry Maynard, whoordered Walter to call special agents with CIs and PCIs. Walter said he didthis, writing the names of five agents contacted on the face of the teletype. By8 a.m., Maynard had arrived for work and Walter went home.Five days later, on November 22, 1963, Walter said, he was in a barber shop whenhe heard about Kennedy’s assassination. Rushing back to the FBI office, heshowed the teletype to various agents and asked, “How could this have happened?We had five days’ notice!” Later that day, Walter said, he typed a copy of theteletype and wrote the five agents’ names on the copy, which he took home.Walter said soon after the assassination, Director Hoover ordered all agents inthe New Orleans office who had written reports dealing with the case to reviewthose reports. The object was to make sure there was nothing in them that might“embarrass the Bureau.” Originals of the reports were to be destroyed.Checking the relevant file later, Walter discovered the teletype was missing. In1975, Walter told his story and showed his copy of the teletype to senatorRichard Schweiker of Pennsylvania. Later the House Select Committee onAssassinations looked into the matter. The committee checked with New Orleansagents, supervisor Maynard, and even Walter’s ex-wife, who also worked for theFBI. All claimed to know nothing about a teletype. The committee, declaring thatit “declined to believe that that many employees of the FBI would have remainedsilent for such a long time,” concluded that Walter’s story was “unfounded.”Unfounded or not, there were other stories in New Orleans that were even harderto dismiss—take, for example, Adrian Thomas Alba, operator of the Crescent CityGarage. The Crescent City Garage was located next door to the William ReilyCoffee Company, Oswald’s employer while in New Orleans. Alba, a quiet man whohas not sought publicity, was both operator and part owner of the garage. Albasaid the garage had a contract to maintain a number of cars for the nearbySecret Service and FBI offices.Alba said Oswald made frequent visits to his garage during the summer of 1963and he got to know the ex-Marine quite well. They talked about firearms and Albawould loan Oswald his gun magazines. He claimed to have helped Oswald fix thesling on his rifle.But Alba’s best story concerns a visit in early summer 1963. He said a man hebelieved to be an “FBI agent visiting New Orleans from Washington” came to hisgarage and took a green Studebaker from the car pool, after showing hiscredentials. The next day Alba said he saw the same car parked by Oswald’sworkplace about thirty yards away. According to Alba, “Lee Oswald went acrossthe sidewalk. He bent down as if to look in the window and was handed whatappeared to be a good-sized white envelope. He turned and bent as if to hold theenvelope to his abdomen, and I think he put it under his shirt. Oswald went backinto the building and the car drove off.”Years later, Alba said he saw the same thing happen the next day, but wasfarther away and could not see what was passed to Oswald. He said he did nottell the Warren Commission about these incidents because he did not recall themuntil 1970 when he was reminded of them by a TV commercial depicting a manrunning to and from a taxi.The House Select Committee on Assassinations checked garage records and foundthat two Studebakers had been signed out during that time in 1963, but by SecretService agents.Alba recalled seeing Oswald after he was fired from the coffee company,allegedly for malingering. Alba said Oswald seemed pleased with the turn ofevents and said he expected to soon be working at the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration (NASA) plant near New Orleans. Alba quoted Oswald assaying, “I have found my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.” Of course, thiswas not to be. Oswald’s destiny lay in Dallas.But oddly enough, five Reily Coffee employees, all of whom were in contact withOswald, did join the NASA facility shortly after Oswald’s departure. Former NewOrleans district attorney Jim Garrison came across these intriguing employmentshifts during his ill-fated JFK assassination probe. Oswald left the coffeecompany on July 19, 1963, just a few weeks before he began his public show ofhanding out FPCC material. According to Garrison, Alfred Claude, the man whohired Oswald at Reily, went to work for Chrysler Aerospace Division at NASA’sNew Orleans facility. Emmett Barbee, Oswald’s immediate superior at Reily,followed Claude to the NASA center in a few days. And within a few weeks theywere joined by John D. Branyon and Dante Marachini, both of whom worked withOswald. Branyon and Marachini also began aerospace careers at the New OrleansNASA center. Marachini, who had gone to work for Reily the same day as Oswald,also was a friend of CIA-Mafia agent David Ferrie.To compound these oddities, Garrison found that two of Ferrie’s friends alsowent to work for the NASA center about this same time. James Lewallen, a friendof Ferrie’s who lived in the same apartment house as Marachini, went to work forBoeing, located in the NASA complex. Melvin Coffee, who had accompanied Ferrieon his strange Texas odyssey the night of the assassination, was hired by NASAat Cape Kennedy in Florida.Was all this coincidence or was there some connecting link between theseoccurrences? Garrison claimed these men were lured into government-connectedjobs so as to make them unavailable during the subsequent assassinationinvestigation. And in fact, none of these men were called to testify before theWarren Commission. Garrison wrote in A Heritage of Stone, “The fact that thesetransfers were being made not in direct support of the assassination, butlooking far beyond that, in order to complicate further investigations whichmight afterward occur, serves to give some idea of the scope and professionalnature of the entire operation.”Other Dallas FBI agents swore under oath that Oswald was never an FBI informant.However, the truthfulness of their statements has come under severe question inlight of the saga of Dallas FBI agent James P. Hosty Jr., who was assigned tocheck on Oswald prior to the assassination. Although Hosty claims to never havemet Oswald in person, his name, address, telephone number, and car licensenumber appeared in Oswald’s personal notebook—a fact omitted from a December 23,1963, FBI report to the Warren Commission.In testimony to the Commission, Director Hoover explained that the omission wasdue to the fact that the report was not originally intended for the Commission.He said that the information on Hosty in Oswald’s notebook was presented to theCommission in a February 11, 1964, report. Of course, by that time, theCommission was already very much aware of the connection between Hosty andOswald.Hoover also explained that it was not unusual for agents to leave their name,address, and telephone number for persons they were attempting to contact. Hesaid Oswald’s wife, Marina, probably jotted down Hosty’s license number for herhusband. Hosty, however, claimed he had parked his car some distance from thehouse where Marina was staying to avoid drawing attention to his visit.On January 22, 1964, Texas attorney general Waggoner Carr called WarrenCommission general counsel J. Lee Rankin to report that he had information thatOswald had been recruited as an informant for the FBI in September 1962. Hefurther stated that Oswald was being paid $200 a month and assigned InformantNumber S-179 or S-172. Carr cited Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade, aformer FBI man, as the source of this information. The number designation wasnot in accordance with normal FBI informant identification but because of theuncertainty of the numbers, it obviously was mistranslated during communicationto Wade and the letter “S” was used to signify “security” matters, which wouldhave fitted with Oswald’s background.This led to the question of Oswald’s cashing money orders and checks. One suchincident involved Western Union Telegraph Company night manager C. A. Hamblen,who just a few days after the assassination got into a brief conversation withBob Fenley, a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald. Hamblin told Fenley herecalled Oswald, or a man who looked just like him, causing trouble in theWestern Union office while trying to cash money orders in small amounts and oncesending a telegram to the secretary of the Navy. Hamblen said he was certain itwas Oswald who on more than once occasion was disagreeable to the office girlsto the point that Hamblen himself would serve him. Fenley had the newspaper’spolice reporter, George Carter, talk to Hamblen to verify his account. Carterdid and then wrote a story for the paper that subsequently brought the matter tothe attention of the Warren Commission. Federal authorities ordered WesternUnion officials to search for records confirming the transactions but none werefound. By the time the Commission questioned Hamblen, July 23, 1964, he hadbecome less certain of the disagreeable man’s identity. The Warren Commissionreported that Hamblen’s superiors at Western Union had concluded the whole thingwas a figment of Hamblen’s imagination. They added, “And the commission acceptsthis assessment.”Less easy to dismiss were others’ statements reporting that Oswald had attemptedto cash checks or money orders. Leonard E. Hutchinson, proprietor of Hutch’sMarket in Irving, Texas, recalled that shortly before the assassination a manwho looked like Oswald would stop in to purchase milk and cinnamon rolls. Onetime this man was accompanied by an elderly woman and a younger woman who spokea foreign language. On another occasion the Oswald character left without a wordwhen Hutchinson refused to cash a two-party check for $189, as a matter of storepolicy, which limited check cashing to less than $25. Since Oswald was usuallyat the Irving home of Ruth Paine only on weekends and in “the absence of anyother sign that Oswald ever possessed a personal check for $189,” the Commissiondecided he had never had such a check.Anyone who has worked for the government knows that officials are very diligentabout withdrawing taxes. It is interesting to note that if Oswald was being paid$200 a month as an FBI informant, his take-home pay would have been about $189.The specter of Oswald as an FBI informant prompted a special executive sessionof the Warren Commission the same day as Carr’s call. The minutes of thatmeeting were classified “top secret” until March 1975. At this meetingCommissioners were tense. What could they do with this report that Oswald,already designated as JFK’s assassin, was working for the FBI?Commission general counsel J. Lee Rankin said, “When the Chief Justice and Iwere just briefly reflecting on [the Oswald–FBI informant rumor], we said ifthat was true and it ever came out, could be established, then you would havepeople think that there was a conspiracy to accomplish this assassination thatnothing the Commission did or anybody could dissipate.”Representative Hale Boggs of Louisiana mused, “Its implications are . . . arefantastic.”Referring to the fact that the Commission had no independent investigators andwas forced to rely on the FBI for its information, Rankin complained, “[The FBI]would like us to fold up and quit. . . . They found the man. There is nothingmore to do. The Commission supports their conclusions, and we can go on home andthat is the end of it.”Boggs remarked, “I don’t even like to see this being taken down.” Former CIAdirector and Commission member Allen Dulles agreed: “Yes, I think this recordought to be destroyed. Do you think we need a record of this?”On January 27, the commissioners met again to consider this information. It isobvious from the transcripts that they feared approaching Hoover with thematter. Turning to former CIA director Dulles, Boggs asked how the FBI coulddisprove that Oswald was an informant. Dulles replied, “That is a hard thing todisprove, you know. . . . I never knew how to disprove it. . . . The record maynot be on paper. But on paper you would have hieroglyphics that only two peopleknow what they meant, and nobody outside of the agency would know; and you couldsay this meant the agent and somebody else could say it meant another agent.”“The man who recruited [the agent] would know, wouldn’t he?” asked Boggs. “Yes,but he wouldn’t tell,” replied Dulles. “Wouldn’t tell under oath?” asked anincredulous Earl Warren, chief justice of the US Supreme Court and chair of theCommission. Dulles replied, “I wouldn’t think he would tell under oath, no. . .. He ought not tell it under oath. . . . What I was getting at, I think, underany circumstances. I think Mr. Hoover would say certainly he didn’t haveanything to do with this fellow.”Exasperated, Boggs exclaimed, “What you do is . . . make our problem utterlyimpossible because you say this rumor can’t be dissipated under anycircumstances.”During this same meeting Rankin revealed that he had received the sameOswald-informant information from yet another source—the Secret Service. He saidthe Secret Service named a Dallas deputy sheriff, Allan Sweatt, as its source.It was here that the commissioners decided to just drop the entire matter. TheFBI was informing them that Oswald was never an informant, and they could neverprove or disprove it.Furthermore, although it would be several weeks before the Commission beganhearing witnesses and taking testimony, it now appears the verdict already wasin. In the same Commission minutes, Georgia senator Richard Russell commented,“They [the FBI] have tried the case and reached a verdict on every aspect.”If Oswald was working for the FBI, it could explain many things. It couldexplain his mysterious movements and associations in New Orleans, where he triedto join both pro- and anti-Castro groups. It could explain why he asked forAgent Quigley after his arrest. It could explain his light sentence after beingfound guilty of disturbing the peace. It could explain the remarks—laterdenied—by Agent Hosty in Dallas that the FBI knew about Oswald. It also couldexplain why the FBI did not pass along its security file on Oswald to the Dallaspolice and it could explain why Dallas FBI chief Shanklin demanded that Hosty beallowed to question Oswald while in police custody.It also might explain a well-documented instance of the FBI destroying evidenceafter the assassination. In August 1975, the Dallas Times Herald reported it hadrecently learned that two weeks before the JFK assassination, Oswald haddelivered a note to the Dallas FBI office and that the note had been destroyedafter the assassination. This story prompted an investigation by the JusticeDepartment and eventually became the center of hearings before a subcommittee ofthe House Judiciary Committee.It is now certain that two to three weeks prior to the assassination, Oswaldcame to the Dallas FBI office and asked a receptionist to see Agent Hosty. Whentold Hosty was not in, Oswald left a note. The receptionist, Nancy Fenner, notedthat Oswald asked for “S.A. [Special Agent] Hosty . . . [in] exactly thosewords.” It’s surprising that Oswald would be so familiar with bureau jargon.Years later Fenner recalled the note as some type of warning, something like,“Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Departmentif you don’t stop bothering my wife—Lee Harvey Oswald.”Hosty, who said he was told not to mention the note at the time of theassassination, said the note was not violent in tone and that it said somethingmore like, “If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to medirectly. If you don’t cease bothering my wife, I will take appropriate actionand report this to the proper authorities.”Hosty also said the note was folded and expressed doubts that Fenner had read itproperly.He said that within hours after the assassination, he was called into the officeof the special agent in charge, J. Gordon Shanklin. Hosty said Shanklin wasvisibly “agitated and upset” and wanted to know about the Oswald note. AfterOswald had been killed, Shanklin again called in Hosty. Hosty said Shanklinproduced the Oswald note from his desk drawer and said, “Oswald’s dead now.There can be no trial. Here, get rid of this.” As Hosty tore up the note,Shanklin cried, “No! Get it out of here. I don’t even want it in this office.Get rid of it!” Hosty said he took the pieces of the note to a nearby restroomand “flushed it down the drain.”Another Dallas agent, Kenneth Howe, also testified he showed Shanklin the Oswaldnote the weekend of the assassination. Existence of the note also was talkedabout among some members of the Dallas Police Department. Ruth Paine evenmentioned in her testimony to the Warren Commission in 1964 that Oswald haddropped off a note to the FBI. She told the Commission, “[Oswald] told me he hadstopped at the downtown office of the FBI and tried to see the agents and left anote.”The House Select Committee on Assassinations said the incident concerning thenote was a “serious impeachment of Shanklin’s and Hosty’s credibility,” and thatwith the note’s destruction, “it was not possible to establish with confidencewhat its contents were.”To the House committee Shanklin denied any knowledge of the Oswald note. Butassistant FBI director William Sullivan said Shanklin had discussed an “internalproblem” concerning a message from Oswald with him and that the presence of thenote was common knowledge at FBI headquarters, thus adding the crime of perjuryto destruction of evidence.Why did the bureau acknowledge the existence of the note only after mediareports in 1975? It seems unbelievable that the FBI would knowingly destroyevidence, especially if it would have proven Oswald prone to violence. Someresearchers say a more plausible explanation is that Oswald, as an FBIinformant, tried to warn the bureau about the coming assassination. This couldexplain the receptionist’s insistence that the note contained threatening words.It also could explain why the FBI was so concerned and fearful of the note thatit was ordered destroyed. Such a warning would corroborate Judyth Vary Baker’sclaim that Oswald tried to stop the assassination.Incidentally, Hosty was one of seventeen FBI agents reprimanded for the way theyhandled the assassination case. He was suspended for thirty days without pay andtransferred to Kansas City. However, after the Oswald-note matter wasinvestigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations and despite thecontradictions between Hosty’s testimony and that of his superior, Shanklin,Hosty was given more than $1,000 in repayment for the Hoover-imposed suspension.“Rather than come out and admit [that I was wronged in 1963] . . . [the FBI]just gave me my money back,” commented Hosty.In light of the FBI’s meticulously worded denials that Oswald had ever been paidas an FBI informant, it should be noted that not all informants work for money.It is common practice for the FBI to gain information from people who havesomething to fear from the bureau, perhaps the possibility of being charged witha past crime or even possible deportation. Oswald’s wife had never become a UScitizen and therefore was subject to deportation at the government’s pleasure.She even mentioned this to the Warren Commission, saying, “Sometimes the FBIagents asked me questions which had no bearing or relationship [to theassassination], and if I didn’t want to answer, they told me that if I wanted tolive in this country, I would have to help in this matter.”According to Dallas police captain Will Fritz, Oswald became angry when AgentHosty confronted him. According to Fritz, Oswald “beat on the desk and went intoa kind of tantrum,” telling Hosty, “I know you. You accosted my wife on twooccasions.” Asked by Fritz what he meant by “accosted,” Oswald replied, “Well,he threatened her. . . . He practically told her she would have to go back toRussia.” Perhaps Oswald was recruited not with the promise of money, but withthe threat of Marina’s deportation.While this may never be proven, this author learned years ago that the Dallaspolice received a letter about two weeks before the assassination warning thatan attack on Kennedy would take place in their city. It was signed by A. J.Hidell, Oswald’s alias. With nothing else to support this warning, the letterwas merely filed away. In the days following that fateful Friday, federal agentscombed through the police department—even searching the saddlebags on policemotorcycles—and took everything that might deal with the assassination. Needlessto say, the Hidell warning letter has never been seen again. Did Oswald try toalert both the FBI and the Dallas police to the coming assassination?Finally, while it cannot be established with any certainty that Oswald wasworking for the FBI, it is now known that his killer definitely was. In early1959, at a time when Jack Ruby may have been involved in smuggling activitieswith Cubans, he contacted the FBI and said he wanted to provide the bureau withinformation. Accordingly, agent Charles W. Flynn opened a potential confidentialor criminal informant (PCI) file on Ruby.The relationship between Ruby and the bureau was mentioned in a letter fromHoover to the Warren Commission dated June 9, 1964. However, this informationwas kept classified until 1975.In the 1964 letter, Hoover stated that Ruby “furnished no information whatsoeverand further contacts with him were discontinued.” This disclaimer is difficultto swallow, since records show that agents met with Ruby on at least eightoccasions between April and October 1959.Since Ruby was an FBI informant, and considering the massive circumstantialevidence now available concerning Oswald’s relationship to the bureau, thepossibility of Lee Harvey Oswald’s having worked for the bureau appears to beprobable.[images/line.jpg]And if by the spring of 1963, when Oswald arrived in New Orleans, he was indeedworking with the FBI, it could explain his contacts with the characters at 544Camp Street.Cuban Grand Central Station [Contents.html#rsec50]By the summer of 1963 the faded three-story Newman Building at the corner ofCamp and Lafayette Streets in New Orleans had become known as the “Cuban GrandCentral Station.”Previously housed here was the CIA-backed Cuban Revolutionary Council, whichcounted Carlos Bringuier as a member, as well as Sergio Archaca-Smith’s Crusadeto Free Cuba, both virulently anti-Castro groups. Also in the same building wasthe private detective firm of Guy Banister. In the summer of 1963, Banister’semployees included Jack Martin and David Ferrie, Oswald’s former Civil AirPatrol leader, and reportedly Oswald himself.During the 1940s Banister was the special agent in charge of the FBI office inChicago, Jack Ruby’s hometown. One of his FBI associates at that time was RobertMaheu, who left the bureau in the 1950s and later became the chief go-between inthe CIA-Mafia assassination plots against Castro.According to Banister’s family, he was also involved with naval intelligenceduring the war and maintained contacts with that group throughout his life.Banister left the bureau and came to New Orleans in the 1950s at the request ofthe mayor to become chief of police. However, in 1957, he was forced to retireafter an incident in the Old Absinthe House, where Banister allegedly threateneda waiter with a gun. He then formed Guy Banister Associates, which occupied aground-floor office in the Newman Building with the address of 531 LafayetteStreet, the side entrance to 544 Camp Street. This office was within walkingdistance of the New Orleans FBI office, the Office of Naval Intelligence, andother government agencies.A member of the John Birch Society, Banister also was a member of the Minutemenand the Louisiana Committee on Un-American Activities, and was the publisher ofa racist publication titled Louisiana Intelligence Digest. Reportedly analcoholic, Banister was later described as “a tragic case” by a member of theNew Orleans Crime Commission.With the rise of Fidel Castro, Banister threw himself into the anti-Castro Cubanactivity in New Orleans. He helped organize such anti-Castro groups as the CubanRevolutionary Democratic Front and Friends of a Democratic Cuba. According to anApril 25, 1967, story in the New Orleans States-Item, Banister even served as amunitions supplier during the planning stages of the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Infact, Banister employees have said that as late as 1963, guns of every typelittered Banister’s office.Banister also ran a network of young informants on the campuses of Tulane andLouisiana State Universities, collecting what he hailed as the largest file ofanticommunist intelligence in the South.Jerry Milton Brooks, a former Minuteman who worked for Banister, said he wouldregularly take Banister’s updated files to the New Orleans FBI office, wherethey were integrated into the bureau’s files. Brooks also said Maurice B.Gatlin, another Banister employee who regarded the younger Brooks as a protégé,once said, “Stick with me—I’ll give you a license to kill.”Although Banister’s files were scattered after his sudden death in June 1964—hereportedly died of a heart attack before authorities could question him abouthis contacts with Oswald and the assassination—some idea of their scope can befound in indexed titles made public by Louisiana lawmen. “Central IntelligenceAgency,” “Ammunition and Arms,” “Civil Rights Program of JFK,” andsignificantly, “Fair Play for Cuba Committee” and “International Trade Mart” arejust a few of these titles. Banister’s operation was right in the thick of NewOrleans intelligence activities, located near government offices and just aroundthe corner from the Reily Coffee Company, Oswald’s employer and a supporter ofanti-Castro Cuban exiles.Banister’s secretary, Delphine Roberts, recalled Oswald at 544 Camp Street, andsaid he filled out one of Banister’s “agent” application forms. She later toldauthor Anthony Summers, “Oswald came back a number of times. He seemed to be onfamiliar terms with Banister and with the office.”Roberts’s daughter, also Delphine, had a photography studio at 544 Camp Streetand she, too, recalled Oswald:I knew he had his pamphlets and books and everything in a room along from wherewe were with our photographic equipment. He was quiet and mostly kept tohimself, didn’t associate with too many people. He would just tell us “hello” or“good-bye” when we saw him. I never saw him talking to Guy Banister, but I knewhe worked in his office. I knew they were associated. I saw some other men wholooked like Americans coming and going occasionally from the room Oswald used. .. . I got the impression Oswald was doing something to make people believe hewas something he wasn’t. I am sure Guy Banister knew what Oswald was doing.It appears that by late summer 1963, Oswald was playing a dangerous game—caughtup in a mixture of CIA- and FBI-related agents who were in touch with bothanti-Castro Cubans and organized-crime figures.[images/line.jpg]Despite the contacts between Oswald and both current and former FBI agents—plusthe evidence of advance warnings of the assassination to the bureau—the Dallastragedy still occurred.While no unquestionable case for FBI involvement in the assassination itself canbe made, there is now no doubt that the bureau manipulated the subsequentinvestigation.For starters, top FBI officials took total control of all evidence the very dayof the assassination and held it, with no chain of evidence, for three full daysbefore the bureau was officially called into the case, as will be discussedlater.About noon on Tuesday, November 26, following several morning conferences withtop aides and the district attorney, police chief Jesse Curry announced toreporters that it had been decided to call in the FBI for assistance with theassassination case. The transfer of evidence from city police to federal controlwas completed four hours later.So now the FBI was officially on the case and officially in charge of theevidence. But what could have happened during the two days while the evidencewas unofficially in their hands? Fabrication, substitution, elimination,alteration—with no effective chain of responsibility, anything could havehappened.Today the FBI has been accused of poor management of evidence at best anddownright falsification of evidence at worst. For example, an FBI documentreleased to the public in 1968, File No. DL 89-43, signed by special agentVincent Drain and dated November 29, 1963, reports that wrapping paper availableat the School Book Depository was “found to have the same observablecharacteristics as the brown paper bag shaped like a gun case which was foundnear the scene of the shooting on the sixth floor.” This is incriminatingevidence against Oswald. However, in 1980 among many FBI documents released bythe bureau was another File No. 89-43, signed by Agent Drain and dated November29, 1963. This one states the wrapping paper from the Depository was “found notto be identical with the paper gun case found at the scene of the shooting.”When asked about this discrepancy, an FBI spokesman simply said the latterdocument was a phony. This prompted researchers to wonder how many other “phony”documents rested in FBI files.Such discrepancies should prove to any objective researcher that severequestions remain concerning the validity of the government’s evidence in theassassination.Under Hoover’s iron control, it would have been easy for ranking bureauofficials to do with the evidence whatever they pleased. The fact that federalauthorities had all the assassination evidence under covert control for two dayscould go far in explaining the contradictions and questionable conclusions ofthe official investigation. Apparently at least one person understood thegravity of this issue, as there was an attempt to obscure it in the WarrenCommission materials.In 1992, the “confidential” deposition of FBI fingerprint expert James C.Cadigan was made public by the National Archives. The deposition was clearlyaltered with edits in pencil intended to obscure statements regarding the earlyunofficial handling of the assassination evidence.While the assassination evidence is often ambiguous and contradictory and willcertainly be in controversy for years to come, the handling of the evidenceclearly points to manipulation and obstruction at the highest levels of federalauthority, providing a clear view of who was responsible for at least thedemonstrable cover-up, if not the assassination itself.In fact, FBI activities after the assassination fall well within the realm ofcriminal behavior. Consider:Suppression of evidence: Examples include the loss of Beverly Oliver’sassassination film, which she claimed was taken by an FBI agent; thedisappearance of an assassination bullet taken from under the noses of a policeguard by an FBI agent; the suppression of testimony, such as Ed Hoffman’s, whichfailed to support the lone-assassin theory; and the bureau’s failure to followimportant leads, even when requested to do so by the Warren Commission.Destruction of evidence: Examples include the destruction of an Oswald note byFBI Agent Hosty; the destruction of a license-plate number on a photograph ofGeneral Edwin Walker’s home found intact among Oswald’s possessions; and theimmediate cleaning of the presidential limousine, which effectively destroyedvital ballistic evidence.Intimidation of witnesses: Examples include Richard Carr, who saw two men runfrom the Texas School Book Depository but later was told by FBI agents, “If youdidn’t see Lee Harvey Oswald in the School Book Depository with a rifle, youdidn’t witness it”; Ed Hoffman, who was told by a bureau agent, “You’d betterkeep quiet; you could get killed”; and Jean Hill, who said she was hounded bybureau agents until she stopped giving media interviews.In any normal criminal case, such behavior would constitute a jailable offense,but this was not an ordinary case, and the culprits were not ordinary citizensbut FBI agents. If a local police agency proves to be corrupt, the FBI can bebrought in to investigate. But in the case of the bureau, who investigates theinvestigators?Since there can be no question that in 1963 the FBI was personified by J. EdgarHoover, the questions of means, motive, and opportunity must fall on hisshoulders. Did Hoover have the means of committing the assassination? Surroundedby countless informers, agents, and former employees—many of whom were incontact with Lee Harvey Oswald—Hoover’s means were limitless.Hoover’s motives are obvious. First, his hatred of the Kennedys was notorious,and second, he was afraid that upon reelection John Kennedy would not allow himto continue as FBI director. This fear was well founded. Rumors in Washingtonwere plentiful that Hoover would be forced to retire as FBI director afterKennedy’s reelection in 1964.William Hundley, former head of the Justice Department’s organized-crimesection, is quoted in The Director as saying that what finally destroyed thefragile relationship between Hoover and attorney general Robert Kennedy was“that Bobby mentioned to too many people who complained to him about Hooverthat, ‘Look, just wait,’ and we all got the message that they were going toretire him after Jack got re-elected and Hoover hit seventy. And it got back tohim.”Presidential aide David Powers stated he believes that the question of Hoover’sretirement was the subject of one of the very few private meetings betweenKennedy and the bureau chief: “[Hoover] had a long lunch with the President andBobby [on October 31, 1963] and, as you know, three weeks later we went toDallas.”But did Hoover have the opportunity? Hoover built his immense power base bycurrying favor with men more powerful than himself. It is extremely unlikelythat Hoover, a consummate bureaucrat, would have assumed the responsibility forinitiating the assassination.It is, however, certainly plausible that Hoover—after having discovered theassassination plot through his network of agents and informers—caused it tohappen simply by not preventing it. Of course this is tantamount to criminalcomplicity and would have required substantial manipulation of testimony andevidence to prevent discovery of the bureau’s role.Hoover would have needed help. And help he had, in the form of the newpresident, his former neighbor and dinner friend Lyndon B. Johnson—another manabout to lose his job thanks to the Kennedys.But what about protection of the president? Could his official protection becircumvented? Could a plot to assassinate a US president succeed without in someway neutralizing or involving the Secret Service?The Secret Service [Contents.html#rsec51]On the day of his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson walked from the Washingtonboardinghouse where he was staying to the Capitol without benefit of anyprotection.It was symptomatic of the young Republic that presidents had not yet acquiredthe mantle of royalty and thus did not require protection. This naïveté began tochange after an assassination attempt on president Andrew Jackson on January 10,1835. In August 1842, a drunken painter threw some rocks at President JohnTyler, who was walking on the White House grounds. Congress soon passed an actcreating an auxiliary watch of the Washington Metropolitan Police for theprotection of public and private property consisting of a captain and fifteenmen. Although the act was aimed primarily at protecting property—particularlythe White House—it was the crude beginning of presidential protection.Even after Abraham Lincoln was fatally shot by actor John Wilkes Booth in Ford’sTheater on April 14, 1865, there was no clamor to create official protection forthe president. Americans thought his death was just an accident of the war.The Secret Service, which was organized as a division of the Treasury Departmentthe year Lincoln was killed, originally was meant only to pursue counterfeiters.It was not until after the assassination of president James A. Garfield in 1881that a serious attempt was made to protect presidents. While the number of WhiteHouse policemen grew to twenty-seven after mail threats increased againstpresident Grover Cleveland, it was not until 1894 that Secret Service agentswere informally assigned to the president.Throughout the Spanish-American War, a small detail of Secret Service men werestationed at the White House. However, Secret Service protection of presidentWilliam McKinley did not prevent his assassination on September 6, 1901.McKinley was attending a public reception at the Pan American Exposition inBuffalo, New York, when self-professed anarchist Leon F. Czolgosz fired twobullets into him despite the proximity of four Buffalo detectives, foursoldiers, and three Secret Service agents. McKinley died eight days later andCzolgosz was executed.The McKinley assassination finally provoked a response from Congress, which in1902 ordered the Secret Service to assume full-time protection of the president.Two agents were permanently assigned to the White House. By World War II, theWhite House detail of the Secret Service had grown to thirty-seven men.Following an unsuccessful attack on president Harry S. Truman by Puerto Ricannationalists in 1951, legislation was passed permanently authorizing the SecretService to protect not only the president, but also his immediate family, thepresident-elect, and the vice president.By 1963, the Secret Service remained a small and specialized group restricted bylaw. Nevertheless, the Secret Service had an average strength of more than fivehundred and ran sixty-five field offices throughout the country.Protecting president John F. Kennedy was no easy matter, as Kennedy was quiteactive in both his public and personal life.Kennedy assistant Kenneth O’Donnell was in charge of the White House staff and,as such, had control over the Secret Service. However, O’Donnell left securitymeasures up to the special agent-in-charge of the White House detail, GeraldBehn. Sizing up the problems of protecting an active president such as Kennedy,O’Donnell once told Behn, “Politics and protection don’t mix.”During his fateful trip to Texas, Kennedy was assigned no fewer than seventySecret Service agents plus eight clerks. This was about 14 percent of the entireSecret Service force. Yet glaring deficiencies in the president’s protection arenow known.Although apparently at least three assassination attempts were planned againstKennedy in the fall of 1963, information on them was not forwarded to either theagent in charge of Kennedy’s protection or the special agent-in-charge of theDallas Secret Service office.In Chicago the Secret Service arrested an ex-Marine named Thomas Arthur Vallee,who was a member of the right-wing John Birch Society and a vocal Kennedycritic. Vallee was discovered to have an M-l rifle, a handgun, and 3,000 roundsof ammunition in his car. It was also learned that Vallee had asked for time offfrom his job on November 2, the date Kennedy was to visit Chicago. Despite theweapons found, Vallee was released from custody on the evening of November 2 andwas still considered a threat. Yet no word of the Vallee matter was transmittedto Dallas.One of the most telling stories to come out of the Secret Service at this time,however, concerned the first black man to serve on the Service’s White Housedetail. Abraham Bolden was personally selected by Kennedy, apparently in anattempt to integrate the previously all-white Secret Service detail.Born in poverty, Bolden had been a police officer with an outstanding recordbefore joining the Service. However, Bolden criticized the White House detailfor laxity and was transferred to the Chicago office.According to Bolden, the Chicago Secret Service office received a teletype fromthe FBI shortly before Kennedy’s November 2 visit warning that an assassinationattempt would be carried out in that city by a four-man Cuban hit squad armedwith high-powered rifles. Bolden said the entire office was involved in thismatter but that it was kept top secret.Years later, Bolden could not identify Vallee as a participant in this threat,and the belief among researchers is that Vallee played no part in the secondassassination plan.Kennedy’s Chicago trip was canceled, although the House Select Committee onAssassinations could not determine why.Three weeks after Kennedy’s death, Bolden discovered that information on theChicago threat was to be kept from the Warren Commission and he made a trip toWashington to tell what he knew. However, he was quickly taken back to Chicago,where he was later charged with discussing a bribe with two knowncounterfeiters. Brought to trial, Bolden was convicted of accepting a bribe—evenafter one of the two counterfeiters admitted to perjury—and was sentenced to alengthy prison term after his motion for a retrial was denied.While the Secret Service has admitted the Chicago threat occurred, it hasrepeatedly refused to clarify the matter. Bolden was released from prison and in2012 continued to gain signatures requesting the president to “expunge, pardonor take other executive action that will clear the record of conviction ofAbraham W. Bolden, Sr.” He claimed he was framed and convicted to silence himregarding the Kennedy threat. Bolden has since learned that the information onthe incident in Chicago came from an informant named “Lee,” naturally leading tospeculation that it may have been informant Lee Oswald. Whatever the Chicagothreat may have been, the information again was not passed along to Dallas.Likewise, the Service failed to follow up on another threat, this time from thevolatile Miami area. Here a wealthy right-wing extremist named Joseph A. Milteeraccurately predicted what was to happen to Kennedy in Dallas almost three weeksbefore the event. Again, while this information was forwarded to the Service’sProtective Research Section (PRS) in Washington, it was never relayed to WinstonG. Lawson, the advance agent in Dallas, or to Forrest V. Sorrels, the specialagent in charge in Dallas.And neither Lawson nor Sorrels got a preview of the zigzag turn that placedKennedy below the Texas School Book Depository windows on November 22.The journey through Dealey Plaza itself was made necessary because of theselection of the Dallas Trade Mart as the site of the noon luncheon for theKennedy entourage. And according to White House aide and advance man JerryBruno, this decision was made by Texas Governor John Connally after somequestionable manipulations.After reviewing possible luncheon sites, the Secret Service and White Houseadvance men settled on two locations—the new Dallas Trade Mart on StemmonsExpressway and the Women’s Building in Fair Park, home of the Texas State Fair,located south of the downtown area.The Secret Service and the Kennedy people decided the Women’s Building would bea preferable location because it presented fewer security problems and couldaccommodate more people. However, Democrats headed by Lyndon Johnson and JohnConnally wanted the Trade Mart because it was more modern and would be moreacceptable to Dallas’s wealthy elite.Bruno wrote, “There was another point about the Women’s Building site thatdidn’t seem important to anyone at the time. If Kennedy had been going thereinstead of to the Trade Mart, he would have been traveling two blocks fartheraway from the Texas School Book Depository—and at a much faster rate of speed.”The struggle over the luncheon site continued until November 18, when Bruno gota call from White House aide Kenneth O’Donnell. Bruno quoted O’Donnell assaying, “We’re going to let Dallas go, Jerry. We’re going to let Connally havethe Trade Mart site.”Bruno was flabbergasted. Despite the recommendations of the Secret Service, theKennedy White House, and himself, Connally had managed to swing the decision tothe Trade Mart. Bruno said he later learned that the Johnson-Connally people hadheld up selling tickets to the fund-raising luncheon in an effort to force thesite-location selection their way.Bruno wrote that upon learning of Kennedy’s death, “I was angry, furious, atConnally and his demands to control the trip, where Kennedy should go, and nowthe President had been shot because we went here instead of there.”But if the Secret Service had no control over the luncheon site, they certainlywere in control of the motorcade. And several strange things happened there.Police Chief Curry originally had asked that the presidential limousine beflanked by eight motorcycle policemen, four on each side of the car. However,Curry told the Warren Commission that Secret Service Agent Lawson ordered thenumber of cycles reduced to four, two on each side, and that the cycles weretold to stay by the rear fender of the limousine. This order seems unusual tothose familiar with motorcade security, since the purpose of motorcycleoutriders is to form a screen for the limousine rider in the event of trouble.Curry was puzzled, too, over this apparent lack of concern for security as wellas the fact that Dallas authorities were kept in the dark about Oswald. Yearslater, he wrote:In retrospect, the physical security arrangements provided by the Dallas PoliceForce for the Secret Service were carried out exactly as they had requested. Inmy opinion all police officers involved gave their complete and wholeheartedcooperation. Yet the Dallas Police Department was never given any information orasked to cooperate with the FBI or Secret Service in any attempt to locatepossible conspirators. The Dallas Police Department was never informed of thepresence of Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, of his connections with the CommunistParty, or the fact that he “was capable of committing the assassination ofPresident Kennedy.”Curry also had planned to have a car containing police captain Will Fritz andother Dallas detectives immediately following the presidential limousine, atraditional practice during similar motorcades in the past. However, againLawson vetoed this plan “so Fritz and his men were not in the motorcade.”And certainly the Dallas detectives could not have moved any slower thanKennedy’s Secret Service protectors when the shots were fired in Dealey Plaza.Photos taken several seconds after the first shots show almost a total lack ofresponse by the agents riding in a backup car behind the presidential limousine.While Kennedy is clutching at his throat, two of his guards have begun lookingtoward the rear while the others are looking directly at the president. The onlyagent to react with speed was Clint Hill, who was not even supposed to be on theDallas trip. Assigned to protect Jackie Kennedy, Hill had been brought along atthe last minute due to a specific request by the First Lady.But the one aspect of the Secret Service protection that raises the disturbingpossibility of complicity concerns the actions of presidential limousine driverWilliam Greer.At age fifty-four, Greer was one of the oldest members of the White Housedetail. He had driven both president Harry Truman and president DwightEisenhower. On the evening of November 22, 1963, Greer drove Kennedy’s body fromAir Force One to Bethesda Naval Hospital for autopsy.Greer testified to the Warren Commission that as the limousine cruised down theincline of Elm Street through Dealey Plaza, he heard a noise that he thought wasa motorcycle backfire. Shortly he heard a second similar noise and glanced overhis right shoulder long enough to see Governor Connally begin to slump to hisleft. Greer said he never caught sight of Kennedy.He said the presidential limousine was moving at between twelve and fifteenmiles per hour the entire time.However, based on films made during the assassination and eyewitness testimony,it is now known that immediately after the first shot, the brake lights on thelimousine came on and the big Lincoln slowed to almost a complete standstill,causing the Secret Service follow-up car to move up and almost touch the rearbumper. Contrary to his testimony, films show Greer looking over his rightshoulder in Kennedy’s direction for several seconds—in fact, until after thefatal head shot is delivered.This discrepancy between Greer’s testimony and reality has caused the moresuspicious-minded researchers to suspect that some individuals within the SecretService may have played a role in placing an underprotected president under theguns in Dealey Plaza. Some even still accept the rumor that Greer himself shotKennedy.By comparing the Zapruder film with the Orville Nix film, it is clear that whenshots were first fired at the president, Greer braked the limousine to almost acomplete stop, and only after the fatal head shot do the brake lights go off andthe car accelerates. All this violates Secret Service regulations, which stateat the first sign of trouble, accelerate and drive out of danger. It is alsoclear that Greer turns his head and looks back at Kennedy at the time of thefatal head shot, which is at odds with his Warren Commission testimony, in whichhe claimed he never looked back and did not even know the assassination hadtaken place until Roy Kellerman next to him said, “Let’s get out of here, we’rehit!”However, a lingering theory that the driver shot Kennedy is not true. If Greerhad shot JFK, someone in the crowd, some less than ten feet away, would havesaid something. Other Secret Service agents and others in the know would havewhispered about this for years. Rumors would have floated around Washington andNellie Connally would have talked, at least as gossip. But none of thishappened.This issue didn’t come up until the mid-1980s, when conspiracy author WilliamCooper latched onto a hypothesis of researcher Lars Hanson of California, who,upon viewing a bad fourth- or fifth-generation copy of the Zapruder film,speculated that the driver turned and shot Kennedy. Upon careful inspection ofthe film and further reflection, Hanson denounced his own theory but this didnot stop Cooper from selling bad copies (some so bad there was no color) of theZapruder film and continuing to assert the driver had shot JFK even thoughHanson and several other JFK researchers, this author included, warned him itwas a false claim. Cooper continued to sell his story to other credulousresearchers until he was killed after shooting at local deputies who came toserve him a warrant in 2001. In addition to his claim that Greer shot JFK,Cooper also claimed that all the nearest witnesses to the JFK head shot weredead within a few years of the assassination, a demonstrably false claim.So what exactly do you see in the Zapruder film? It is true that Greer turns tohis right and looks back at JFK at the time of the head shot, a somewhatsuspicious circumstance, as Greer claimed he never looked back. Greer then facesfront and the car accelerates. In those days it was customary for men to wearhair grease and Kellerman’s hair was especially slicked down. Sunlight glintedoff the top of his head. In viewing the Zapruder film in slow motion, onenotices that the “pistol” moves simultaneously with Kellerman’s head. Also, afew frames earlier when the sunlight gleams off the tops of both Kellerman’shead and Greer’s, the brightness of the highlight is the same. As Greer turns tohis right, Kellerman bends forward slightly and the sun fully catches the top ofhis head, resulting in a bright highlight, which is a horizontal “L” shape andcould be misidentified as a gun, especially if one has been preconditioned tothink of it in that way. But as Kellerman’s head moves, so does the shape. Thebrief flash seen is simply the sunlight reflecting off the metal rim of theframe for the privacy window, used when the top was on the car. That day, thetop was down and the privacy window rolled down but the frame remained. While itmay be questionable as to why Greer turned and looked back at Kennedy and thencould not recall that fact for the Warren Commission, at no time did his twohands leave the steering wheel of the limousine.Greer’s testimony, like that of all government officials presented to the WarrenCommission, was taken at face value and there was no real attempt atcross-examination. Likewise, testimony that indicated why the reaction of theSecret Service agents that day was so sluggish was not examined closely by theWarren Commission.A Few Drinks at the Cellar [Contents.html#rsec52]Within days of the assassination, it was common knowledge in the FortWorth–Dallas area that Kennedy’s Secret Service agents were drinking well intothe morning hours of November 22 at a notorious Fort Worth club, the Cellar.The story eventually spread nationwide when columnist Drew Pearson wrote aboutthe incident, adding editorially, “Obviously men who have been drinking untilnearly 3 a.m. are in no condition to be trigger-alert or in the best physicalshape to protect anyone.”The stories set off an investigation within the Secret Service. Chief James J.Rowley, a former FBI man who had been with the Secret Service since 1938,obtained statements from the ten agents involved, plus some Fort Worth newsreporters and Pat Kirkwood, the club’s owner and an acquaintance of Jack Ruby.Everyone, including Kirkwood, stressed that the Cellar had no license to sellalcoholic drinks. Rowley told the Warren Commission, “This is a place that doesnot serve alcoholic beverages.”Why the concern about alcohol? The Warren Commission cited Section 10 of theSecret Service Manual:10. Liquor, use of—a. Employees are strictly enjoined to refrain from the use ofintoxicating liquor during the hours they are officially employed at their postof duty, or when they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon toperform an official duty. During entire periods of travel status, the specialagent is officially employed and should not use liquor, until the completion ofall of his official duties for the day. . . . However, all members of the WhiteHouse Detail and Special Agents cooperating with them on Presidential andsimilar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for officialduty at any time while in travel status. Therefore, the use of intoxicatingliquor of any kind, including beer and wine, by members of the White HouseDetail . . . while they are in travel status, is prohibited.The regulations further stated, “Violation or slight disregard of the aboveparagraphs . . . will be cause for removal from the Service.”Several of the agents involved, including four who were riding in the SecretService follow-up car behind Kennedy, admitted drinking, but no more than twobeers. Of those who went to the Cellar, most said they had one or two drinkscalled a “Salty Dick,” described as grapefruit juice and soda. Again, everyoneconcerned stressed that the Cellar did not sell alcohol, although alcoholbrought in by a patron was allowed.At least three agents guarding Kennedy’s hotel suite took their “coffee break”at the Cellar, leaving two Fort Worth firemen behind to guard the president.Since all the agents turned out at seven that morning “sober, alert and readyfor the performance of their duties,” Rowley told the Warren Commission he didnot punish them for violating regulations.According to the Warren Commission:Chief Rowley testified that under ordinary circumstances he would have takendisciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clearviolation of the regulation. However, he felt that any disciplinary action mighthave given rise to an inference that the violation of the regulation hadcontributed to the tragic events of November 22. Since he was convinced thatthis was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents andtheir families to take explicit disciplinary measures.Obviously, Rowley and others in the government were very much concerned that thepublic might recall that President Lincoln was killed when his guard left hispost to have a drink next door and might attach some significance to the factthat Kennedy’s agents were keeping late hours in a “beatnik” club owned by anassociate of Jack Ruby.The entire affair was toned down and quietly forgotten—except by Cellar ownerKirkwood. During the intervening years, Kirkwood has admitted that while theCellar had no license to sell liquor, nothing prevented him from giving it away.And give it away he did. In a 1984 article in the Fort Worth Star-Telegramrecalling the wild days of the Cellar, Kirkwood recalled, “We had strange rules.We’d give drinks to doctors, lawyers, politicians, stag girls, policemen,anybody we thought we might need if something broke out.”Kirkwood’s mother recalled that sometimes her son would “give away five hundreddollars’ worth of whiskey in a month.” This author, even though underage, wasserved alcohol in the Cellar when accompanied by older news reporters. In thenewspaper article, Kirkwood mentioned the Secret Service incident:After midnight the night before [the assassination], some reporters called mefrom the Press Club [of Fort Worth], which didn’t have a license to sell drinksafter midnight. [They] said they had about 17 members of the Secret Service andasked if they could bring them to my place. I said sure. About 3:30 [a.m.],these Secret Service men were sitting around giggling about how the firemen wereguarding the President over at the Hotel Texas. That night got the Cellarmentioned in the Warren Report.Jimmy Hill, who managed the Cellar for eleven years, was even more to the pointin that same article:After the agents were there, we got a call from the White House asking us not tosay anything about them drinking because their image had suffered enough as itwas. We didn’t say anything, but those guys were bombed. They were drinking pureEverclear [190 proof alcohol].It might be noted that no one saw the agents in a drunken revelry—although atleast one unmarried female reporter tagged along with them for company. In fact,according to most present, the agents sat by themselves quietly talking anddrinking. However, the fatigue of the multi-stop Texas trip coupled with thealcohol and lack of sleep obviously left the agents in less-than-optimalcondition to perform their duties.During the wild ride to Parkland Hospital, presidential aide Kenneth O’Donnellthought about the interval between the final shots. Years later, he wrote:If there was an interval of at least five seconds between the second and thirdshots, as it seemed, that was long enough for a man to run 50 yards. If theSecret Service men in the front had reacted quicker to the first two shots atthe President’s car, if the driver had stepped on the gas before instead ofafter the fatal third shot was fired, would President Kennedy be alive today?Former senator Ralph Yarborough echoed O’Donnell’s concern when he wrote theWarren Commission:All of the Secret Service men seemed to me to respond very slowly, with no morethan a puzzled look. Knowing something of the training that combat infantrymenand Marines receive, I am amazed at the lack of instantaneous response by theSecret Service when the rifle fire began.The reaction-impairment issue aside, conspiracy-minded researchers, noting thatthroughout history a great man’s bodyguards usually have been the key to asuccessful coup d’état, have suggested that Kennedy’s guards may have been awareof the coming events in Dealey Plaza and were under too much stress to get aquiet night’s sleep.Interestingly, none of Vice President Johnson’s Secret Service guards were inthe entourage that drank at the Press Club and then moved on to the Cellar.[images/line.jpg]Aside from the sluggish reaction of the Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza,other oddities occurred in the motorcade during the assassination.One agent, John D. Ready, did start to react by jumping off the follow-up car (a1956 Cadillac touring sedan convertible). However, he was recalled by specialagent in charge Emory Roberts.This was reminiscent of an earlier incident as the motorcade left Love Field.Captured on film by ABC’s Dallas affiliate WFAA, agent Henry J. Rybka can beseen being waved off Kennedy’s limousine by Roberts. He then throws his handsseveral times to reflect his confusion over this unusual and unexplained order.Then there is the much-publicized story of agent Rufus Youngblood, whoreportedly threw himself valiantly on top of Vice President Johnson after theshooting began in Dealey Plaza. Youngblood was considered the hero of the hour.In his report of that day, Youngblood wrote that upon hearing the first shot, “Iquickly looked all around again and could see nothing to shoot at, so I steppedover into the back seat and sat on top of the vice President.”In a statement to the Warren Commission, Johnson mentioned the incident:I was startled by a sharp report or explosion, but I had no time to speculate asto its origin because Agent Youngblood turned in a flash, immediately after thefirst explosion, hitting me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in theback seat to get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood. Almost in the samemoment in which he hit or pushed me, he vaulted over the back seat and sat onme. I was bent over under the weight of Agent Youngblood’s body, toward Mrs.Johnson and Senator Yarborough.Years later in his book, The Vantage Point, Johnson elaborated:It is apparent that there were many reactions to the first shot. . . . I did notknow what it was. Agent Youngblood spun around, shoved me on the shoulder topush me down and shouted to all of us, “Get down!” Almost in the same movement,he vaulted over the seat, pushed me to the floor, and sat on my right shoulderto keep me down and to protect me. Agent Youngblood’s quick reaction was asbrave an act as I have ever seen anyone perform. When a man, without a moment’sthought or hesitation, places himself between you and a possible assassin’sbullet, you know you have seen courage. And you never forget it.However, former Texas senator Ralph Yarborough, who was sitting beside Johnsonthat day, told this author, “It just didn’t happen. . . . It was a small car,Johnson was a big man, tall. His knees were up against his chin as it was. Therewas no room for that to happen.”Yarborough recalled that both Johnson and Youngblood ducked down as the shootingbegan and that Youngblood never left the front seat. Yarborough said Youngbloodheld a small walkie-talkie over the back of the car’s seat and that he andJohnson both put their ears to the device. He added, “They had it turned downreal low. I couldn’t hear what they were listening to.”It would be most interesting to learn what the men listened to, since Dallaspolice radio channel 1 designated for the presidential party was blocked fromradio traffic for about eight minutes beginning at 12:26 p.m., about fourminutes before the shooting, by a transmitter stuck open. It may have been thatJohnson and Youngblood were listening to a channel reserved for inter-vehicleradio traffic, but no transcripts of this channel have been made public.Obviously, either Yarborough or Johnson and his Secret Service agents did nottell the truth of what happened in the motorcade.In reviewing the Secret Service activity in the course of Kennedy’s Dallas trip,even the gullible Warren Commission concluded that while “the detailed securitymeasures taken at Love Field and the Trade Mart were thorough and well-executed,in other respects . . . the advance preparations for the President’s trip weredeficient.”The House Select Committee on Assassinations was even harsher, stating:In summary, the committee concluded that the Secret Service did in fact possessinformation that was not properly analyzed and put to use with respect to aprotective investigation in advance of President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas.Further, it was the committee’s opinion that Secret Service agents in thePresidential motorcade in Dallas were not adequately prepared for an attack by aconcealed sniper. Finally, the committee found that the investigation by theSecret Service of a possible assassination conspiracy was terminated prematurelywhen President Johnson ordered that the FBI assume primary investigativeresponsibility.There is cause for suspicion over the mystery of men encountered by severalpeople in Dealey Plaza—including at least one policeman—who claimed to be SecretService agents and even displayed credentials. Officially, all agents were inthe motorcade or already at the Trade Mart. No government panel has everadequately investigated this matter to determine whether these men were bogus orreal agents.Whether laxity, negligence, violations of regulations, or even malice, all theaccusations against the Secret Service pale when compared to the 1992 nonfictionbook Mortal Error, in which author Bonar Menninger claims that Secret Serviceagent George Hickey, riding the backup car, attempted to return fire at Oswaldin the sixth floor, but bumbled and accidently shot Kennedy in the back of hishead with an AR-15, the civilian model of the Army’s M-16 rifle. Menninger, thena reporter for the Kansas City Business Journal, obtained most of his theoryfrom Howard Donahue, a retired ballistics expert from Towson, Maryland. In 1995,Agent Hickey sued publisher St. Martin’s Press over this claim but the suit wasdropped in 1997 due to arguments that too much time had passed since the bookwas published. In 1998 a settlement for an undisclosed sum was reached betweenHickey and St. Martin’s. While warmly embraced and publicized by theEstablishment media at the time, Menninger’s thesis was largely dismissed by theJFK research community, primarily on the basis that films of the assassinationshowed no such shooting by Hickey was possible. However, it is true that Hickeybrandished an AR-15 after the motorcade left Dealey Plaza, as was seen anddescribed by Ed Hoffman and others along the route to Parkland.While the president’s guards certainly had the opportunity to achieve Kennedy’sdeath—either through direct action or through inaction—no motive has beenestablished. And since the Service is a small agency within the federalgovernment with relatively little power or influence, no one seriously believesthat the Secret Service initiated or orchestrated the assassination.However, there remains a real possibility that certain individuals within theSecret Service may have been working for someone other than John Kennedy onNovember 22, 1963."},{"pageContent":"Rednecks and Oilmen [Contents.html#rch9]By the fall of 1963, President John F. Kennedy had acquired more domesticenemies than just irate anti-Castro Cubans, vengeful mob bosses, and disgruntledintelligence operatives.Both big business and supporters of states’ rights felt threatened by the newKennedy brand of federalism—the wielding of total power from Washington.Hatred of Kennedy also was being fomented among those people opposed to thegrowing civil rights movement, particularly in the old Confederate states, whichincluded Texas.Into this cauldron of century-old passions stepped Kennedy the politician,hoping to find a middle ground between the radical activists—on both sides.Kennedy friend Theodore Sorensen wrote, “Jack Kennedy . . . knew comparativelylittle and cared little about the problems of civil rights and civil liberties.”However, during the presidential campaign of 1960, Kennedy found it expedient tochastise the Eisenhower administration for not doing more to end segregation,despite the fact that two civil rights bills were passed during that time, thefirst such major legislation since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.In his 1961 inaugural address, Kennedy spurred on the expectations of millionsof black Americans when he said:Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, thatthe torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans . . . one unwillingto witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nationhas always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and aroundthe world.Such rhetoric was effective for Kennedy. During the 1960 election, blacksresponded to Dr. Martin Luther King’s support of Kennedy. They turned out ahefty 78 percent vote for the Massachusetts senator.By 1962, polls showed Kennedy ranked behind only King himself in popularityamong black Americans despite the fact that immediate action by Kennedy on civilrights was limited. Although Kennedy had promised to end segregation in federalhousing, it was nearly two years after taking office, with violent racialincidents increasing across the nation, before he took action. Kennedy dawdleduntil June 1963, before sending his own civil rights bill to Congress and eventhis did not pass until after his death, when the measure was adroitlymaneuvered through Congress by President Lyndon Johnson.By September 1961, following a summer of tension, violence, and bus “FreedomRides,” the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting on a request by PresidentKennedy, banned segregation on buses and in terminals.While the Kennedys certainly did not invent the problem and, in fact, joined thepush for civil rights belatedly and reluctantly, they nevertheless were thefirst major American leaders to fully address the problem and appeal for wisdomand restraint from both blacks and whites.And despite its faint beginnings, some of the most dramatic accomplishments ofthe Kennedy administration were in the area of civil rights. For the first timeblacks were appointed to major government jobs as well as judgeships; civilrights laws aimed at ending voter discrimination and public segregation werevigorously enforced by the Kennedy Justice Department despite a recalcitrant J.Edgar Hoover, and an executive order was issued creating a Committee on EqualEmployment Opportunity headed by Vice President Johnson.But racial problems continued. The day after Kennedy’s inaugural address, ablack Air Force veteran named James Meredith applied for enrollment to thesegregated University of Mississippi but was rejected. In his fourth attempt toenroll, Meredith arrived in Oxford, Mississippi, on September 30 accompanied bythree hundred US marshals. He was met by a crowd of about 2,500 segregationistsand students who turned Meredith and his supporters away with bricks andbottles. The marshals responded with tear gas, and a bloody night-long riotensued—leaving two people dead and more than 375 injured, including 166 federalofficers.The violence was quelled by the arrival of 3,000 Army and National Guard troopsand Meredith was enrolled on October 1 under the protection of marshals whoremained with him until his graduation in August 1963. One of those involved inthat bloody incident was a former Army general named Edwin A. Walker who laterwould be connected with Lee Harvey Oswald.A Bullet for the General [Contents.html#rsec53]About 9:10 p.m. on April 10, 1963, Major General Edwin A. Walker was narrowlymissed by a rifle bullet that crashed through a first-floor window and slammedinto a wall of his fashionable Dallas home.Seventeen months later the Warren Commission concluded that Walker’s assailantwas none other than Kennedy’s alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Thisconclusion has increasingly been called into question as more information aboutthe event has become known.By the fall of 1963, Walker was notorious in conservative Dallas. A native Texanborn in 1909, Major General Walker was commander of the US Army’s 24th Division,stationed in West Germany, where he used his position to indoctrinate his troopswith right-wing propaganda, including the assertion that both the US governmentand the military had come under “communist control.” The Korean War hero oncedeclared, “We must throw out the traitors, and if that’s not possible, we mustorganize armed resistance to defeat the designs of the usurpers and contributeto the return of a constitutional government.”Ordered to stop this practice, Walker instead resigned from the Army in 1961 andreturned to the United States, where he began making political speaking tours.He even made an unsuccessful bid for governor of Texas in 1962, losing to JohnConnally.On September 30, 1962, Walker was in Oxford, Mississippi, aligned with those whowere trying to prevent the university enrollment of James Meredith. After Walkerwas charged with being a ringleader of the violent Oxford mob, Attorney GeneralRobert Kennedy ordered that he be held temporarily in a mental institution.By 1963, Walker was back in Dallas and had become a prominent figure inright-wing political activity there, particularly in the John Birch Society. Ina 1964 interview with this author, Walker outlined his beliefs:The United Nations charter, which is only eight pages, should have been placedbefore [the American public] to study. Very few . . . have even seen theFulbright Memorandum or the Walter Reuther Memorandum submitted to AttorneyGeneral Kennedy upon his request. . . . Very few had even seen these papers orthe UN declaration on racial discrimination, the UN term for integration. Thispaper declares that the whole world will integrate. I do not know where suchauthority comes from or who it represents. I can realistically predict that noone living today will see 600 million Chinese integrated with 100 millionJapanese, Turks integrated with Greeks, or Mohammedans with Israelis. . . . Acause for America first and last and always is essential to our existence. Allorganizations which are implementing such a cause are in the best interest ofthe country and are needed. The Birch Society is doing a great job in educatingpeople and exposing such memoranda as I have referred to previously.Walker’s connections in the months preceding the assassination are bothconvoluted and intriguing.A driver and aide to Walker in the fall of 1963 was the brother of LarrieSchmidt, who along with Bernard Weissman authored the infamous “Welcome Mr.Kennedy to Dallas . . .” ad that ran in the Dallas Morning News the morning ofNovember 22. The ad, which carried a heavy black border, asked twelve loadedquestions of Kennedy ending with “Why have you scrapped the Monroe Doctrine infavor of the ‘Spirit of Moscow’?” Financial contributors to this anti-Kennedy adincluded oilman H. L. Hunt’s son, Nelson Bunker Hunt; Joseph Grinnan, volunteercoordinator for the local John Birch Society; and H. R. “Bum” Bright, formerowner of the Dallas Cowboys. The ad was signed “The American Fact-FindingCommittee,” but Weissman admitted to the Warren Commission that the group was“formed strictly for the purpose of having a name to put in the paper.”Another Walker aide, Robert Allan Surrey, produced the “Wanted for Treason”leaflets that were distributed along the Kennedy motorcade route. Surrey laterrevealed to researcher Penn Jones that one of his close bridge-playing friendswas none other than James Hosty, the FBI agent who, on orders, destroyed a noteto the bureau from Lee Harvey Oswald after the assassination.But perhaps the most significant connections between Walker and otherassassination-connected characters were his contacts with anti-Castro Cubans andNew Orleans.Carlos Bringuier, the anti-Castro Cuban who was arrested with Lee Harvey Oswaldin New Orleans, was with Walker on the faculty of Christian CrusadeAnti-communist Youth University. According to researcher Gary Shaw, the CIAretained Walker to arm and train Cuban exiles sometime after the Bay of PigsInvasion.One member of the militant Cuban exile group Alpha 66 was Filipe Vidal Santiago,who was frequently seen with Walker. Santiago was known to drive a 1957Chevrolet. Such a car figured prominently in several aspects of theassassination case.About an hour after the slaying of Dallas patrolman J. D. Tippit, policedispatchers broadcast a pickup order for a 1957 Chevrolet last seen at theintersection where Tippit was killed. The charge was: “Investigation of carryinga concealed weapon.” The license number given by police registered to a Dallasman who told researchers he sold the car prior to September 1963, indicating thelicense plate reported on November 22 may have been stolen. This—and otherinstances of cars with illegitimate license plates around the Tippit slaying andOswald’s rooming house—were never adequately investigated.Among the evidence that led the Warren Commission to conclude that it was Oswaldwho shot at General Walker were three photographs made of Walker’s Dallas homefound in Oswald’s belongings. Commission photo experts said backgrounds of thepictures indicated they were made no later than March 10, one month before theattack on Walker and two days before mail orders were sent off for Oswald’spistol and the Carcano rifle.In one of the photographs is a 1957 Chevrolet in Walker’s driveway. Thisphoto—as shown in Warren Commission Exhibit 5—has a hole in it obliterating thecar’s license number.In FBI reports, R. B. Stovall, one of the Dallas detectives who confiscatedOswald’s belongings from the Paine home in Irving, is quoted as saying:At the time he observed this photograph [the detective] surmised that Oswald hadevidently taken the license plate number area out of the photograph to keepanyone from identifying the owner of that automobile. He advised he is positivethe photograph was mutilated as shown in Commission Exhibit 5 at the time theyrecovered it at the Paine residence.According to the bureau, Stovall’s partner, Guy Rose, commented:He had noted that someone had torn out a section on the automobile, which areacontains the license plate for the 1957 Chevrolet. . . . He stated . . . that ithad been mutilated at the time they had recovered the box containing thephotographs.However, during her Warren Commission testimony, Marina Oswald made it clearthat the hole was not there when she was shown the photo by the FBI.She told Commission attorney Wesley Liebeler:When the FBI first showed me this photograph, I remember that the license plate,the number of the license plate was on this car, on this photograph. It had thewhite and black numbers. There was no black spot that I see on it now. When Leeshowed me this photograph there was the number on the license plate on thispicture. . . . This black spot is so striking I would have remembered it if itwere on the photograph that Lee showed me or the FBI. . . . There was no hole inthe original when they showed it to me—I’m positive of it.Someone is lying. If the license number was obliterated while in the hands ofthe FBI, as stated by Marina Oswald, this is clear evidence of officialdestruction of evidence.The truth of the matter came in 1969 with the publication of Dallas police chiefJesse Curry’s JFK Assassination File. On page 113 [Chapter004.html#page_113] isa police photograph of Oswald’s belongings and in the foreground is the Walkerphotograph with the Chevrolet’s license-plate number intact. This piece ofevidence was altered while in the hands of the authorities.Apparently this criminal action disturbed at least one Warren Commission staffmember. In 1966, two years after the Warren Commission had concluded its work,attorney Liebeler wrote a letter to Charles Klihr, a volunteer worker forGeneral Walker, stating:The [Oswald] picture was mutilated by someone in such a manner that the licenseplate is no longer visible. When we noticed this during the investigation weasked the FBI to determine whose car it was. They asked [Walker aide] Surreyabout it and he told them he thought it was your car. I find no indication thatFBI agents talked with you about the matter, however. . . . I would appreciateit very much if you would let me know whether or not the FBI did interview youabout this and if you were able to identify the car as your own.There is no record as to Klihr’s response to Liebeler’s letter.All of these strange connections take on more sinister tones when viewed withthe possibility that General Walker may have even been in contact with Oswald,his assassin Jack Ruby, or both.A tenuous tie may be a St. Paul, Minnesota, man named John Martin, who was anacquaintance of General Walker’s and filmed him in his Dallas home in the latesummer of 1963. Incredibly, Martin journeyed on to New Orleans, where onSeptember 9 he photographed Lee Harvey Oswald handing out Fair Play for CubaCommittee material on the same roll of film.Walker’s connections in New Orleans were many and substantial, ranging fromanti-Castro Cubans in touch with David Ferrie and Guy Banister to Louisianapolitical leaders. According to Louisiana State Police files, Walker wasinvolved in several hurried and secret meetings in New Orleans during the twodays prior to the assassination, including a conference with Judge LeanderPerez, one of the state’s most powerful men.In fact, Walker was on a Braniff flight from New Orleans when Kennedy wasassassinated. He reportedly became upset when word of the assassination wasbroadcast over the plane’s loudspeaker and roamed up and down the aisle tellingfellow passengers to remember that he was on that flight at the time ofKennedy’s death.According to Farewell America, a book by French intelligence agents, Walkerlater joined oilman H. L. Hunt in a secret hideaway in Mexico where “theyremained for a month, protected by personal guards, under the impassive eyes ofthe FBI.”Also in this book, the authors state that in late summer of 1963 David Ferrieintroduced Oswald to both General Walker and Clay Shaw, the director of theInternational Trade Mart later prosecuted by district attorney Jim Garrison.Author Anthony Summers reported that Walker gave a talk in Dallas that may havebeen attended by Lee Harvey Oswald. He quotes another member of the audience whoclaimed Oswald sat at the back of the room during a meeting of the DirectorioRevolutionario Estudiantil, an anti-Castro Cuban group. Oswald reportedly saidnothing during the fund-raising meeting.Then there are disconcerting reports that Walker knew Oswald’s killer, Dallasnightclub owner Jack Ruby. Researcher Penn Jones has stated that Ruby made nosecret of his admiration for the resigned general and that he once stated thatWalker was “100 percent right” in his belief that Cuba should be taken back fromCastro. More significant are the statements of former Walker employee WilliamMcEwan Duff. According to Warren Commission Document 1316-B, Duff claimed thatRuby visited Walker’s home on a monthly basis between December 1962 and March1963, shortly before Walker was fired upon.Many researchers feel it is also significant that General Walker’s name andtelephone number were found in Oswald’s address book. They believe this mayindicate a possible connection between the two. However, Walker maintained henever met Oswald, and the Warren Commission concluded, “Although Oswald’snotebook contained Walker’s name and telephone number there is no evidence thatthey knew each other. It is claimed that this information was inserted at thetime Oswald was planning his attack on Walker.”Yet another odd connection between Walker and the assassination involved carsalesman Warren Reynolds. Reynolds chased the murderer of Patrolman Tippit butinitially was unable to identify Oswald as the killer. Two months later,Reynolds was shot from ambush and after recovering was befriended by GeneralWalker. After consulting with Walker, Reynolds was able to identify Oswald tothe Warren Commission in July 1964.The Warren Commission concluded, without even bothering to talk to Walker, thathis assailant had been Oswald. The evidence used to reach this conclusion wasthe testimony of Marina Oswald, a note discovered at the Paine home, photographsOswald reportedly took of the Walker home, and identification of a bullet foundat the crime scene.Marina Oswald’s testimony has been called into question in a number of matters,and her stories of murder attempts by Oswald on Walker and Richard Nixon arefraught with inconsistencies and omissions. It is also curious that her firststatement that Oswald tried to kill Walker came on December 3, 1963, about aweek after a West German newspaper reported there might be a connection betweenthe Walker shooting and the assassination. The Warren Commission reported thatthe German news story was “fabricated by the editor,” but then advanced the sameallegation.The note in question turned up only after the Kennedy assassination, when SecretService agents showed the note to Ruth Paine and asked her to identify it. Theundated note, written in Russian, reportedly had been left in a Russian volumetitled Book of Useful Advice and was only discovered nearly two weeks after theassassination when it fell out of the book’s pages. Government handwritingexperts declared that Oswald wrote the message, and Marina conveniently toldinvestigators she thought she saw it shortly after the Walker shooting.However, Ruth Paine told the Warren Commission about the Dallas police search ofher home mentioning, “Before I left they were leafing through books to see ifanything fell out but that is all I saw.” Mrs. Paine’s testimony fuels thesuspicion that authorities may have planted the note.In it, Oswald detailed instructions to his wife on what to do in his absence. Hetold her where to find the mailbox key, that the current bills had been paid,and even said she could “throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.” Twonoteworthy passages stated:Send the information as to what has happened to me to the Embassy [undoubtedlythe Russian embassy, which Oswald had been contacting periodically] and includenewspaper clippings—should there be anything about me in the newspapers. Ibelieve that the Embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learningeverything.If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is located at the end of thebridge through which we always passed on going to the city (right in thebeginning of the city after crossing the bridge).These two sections raise troublesome questions for the official version of theWalker shooting.Since Marina reportedly knew nothing of her husband’s attack on Walker inadvance, how could she be expected to watch for stories on Oswald in thenewspapers, since any such account would report only that an unknown sniper hadfired on the general? Also, why would a supposed American defector to Russia whoreturned home expect assistance for his family from the Soviet embassy if hewere charged with the attempted murder of a prominent right-wing Dallasite?Warren Commission critic Sylvia Meagher wrote, “I suggest that Oswald wrote theundated letter in relation to a project other than the attack on GeneralWalker—one that also involved risk of arrest or death—and that Marina wasinformed about her husband’s plans in advance.”As noted by the Warren Commission, Oswald’s letter “appeared to be the work of aman expecting to be killed, or imprisoned, or to disappear.” Yet at the time ofthe Walker incident, he had no money, no passport, and no reasonable expectationof escape.The bullet found in Walker’s home also presents problems. Contemporary newsstories of the April 10 incident quote Dallas police as saying the recoveredbullet was “identified as a 30.06,” not a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano.In 1975, researcher George Michael Evica received FBI spectrographic analyses ofa bullet (CE 399) and bullet fragments reportedly recovered in the assassinationinvestigation. According to Evica, these scientific reports, termed“inconclusive” by Director Hoover when reporting to the Warren Commission,revealed:The bullet recovered in the assassination attempt on General Walker does notmatch either CE 399 or two fragments recovered from President Kennedy’slimousine; the Warren Commission’s linking of Lee Harvey Oswald to the GeneralWalker assassination attempt is seriously weakened.Further confusion over the bullet has been raised by Walker himself, who claimedthe bullet exhibited by the House Select Committee on Assassinations is not thesame bullet recovered from his home in 1963. He said the original slug was somangled as to be hardly recognizable as a bullet.After studying the government’s evidence carefully, author Meagher concluded,“Despite the [Warren] Commission’s reliance on the testimony of Marina Oswald,compelling evidence virtually excludes the use of the Carcano rifle in theattempt on the life of General Walker.”And even if Oswald were responsible for the Walker shooting, there is evidencethat he did not act alone.Walter Kirk Coleman, who in 1963 was a fourteen-year-old neighbor to Walker,told police he heard the shot and, peeking over a fence, saw some men speedingdown the alley in a light green or light blue Ford, either a 1959 or 1960 model.Coleman also said he saw another car, a 1958 black Chevrolet with white down theside, in a church parking lot adjacent to Walker’s house. The car door was openand a man was bending over the backseat as though he was placing something onthe floor of the car. At the time of the Warren Commission, Coleman was notcalled to testify and in fact told Walker that authorities had ordered him notto discuss the incident.Just prior to the Walker shooting, two of the general’s aides saw suspiciousactivity around his home. Walker aide Robert Surrey said on April 6 he saw twomen prowling around the house, peeking in windows. Surrey said the pair weredriving a 1963 dark purple or brown Ford with no license plates.And Walker aide Max Claunch told researcher Gary Shaw that a few nights beforethe shooting incident he noticed a “Cuban or dark-complected man in a 1957Chevrolet” cruise around Walker’s home several times.The problems with the official version of the Walker shooting as well as themany unfollowed leads in this area are troubling to assassination researchers.[images/line.jpg]On January 14, 1963, George Wallace was sworn in as governor of Alabama,pledging, “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever.”In August, following further unrest and violence in the South, Dr. Martin LutherKing Jr. led some 250,000 people in a Freedom March on Washington. Here heproclaimed, “There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until theNegro is granted his citizenship rights.”The march took place less than three months after President Kennedy had finallysubmitted his own civil rights bill in Congress. Resistance to Kennedy’s planswas widespread although a June 1963 Gallup poll indicated 59 percent of thepopulation approved of the president and his programs.On June 12, 1963, Georgia senator Richard B. Russell promised other southernsenators, “To me, the President’s legislative proposals are clearly destructiveof the American system and the constitutional rights of American citizens. Ishall oppose them with every means and resource at my command.”Within six months, Russell was sitting as a member of the Warren Commission,charged with finding the truth of Kennedy’s death.One government employee who watched the famous Washington monuments becomesurrounded by demonstrators was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. The strange andobsessed Hoover was particularly anxious over King and his civil rightsmovement. The aging director not only saw his essentially southern way of lifethreatened but was convinced that King’s organization was being directed bycommunists.William Sullivan, at the time Hoover’s man in charge of intelligence operationsfor the bureau, wrote:Hoover told me that he felt that King was, or could become, a serious threat tothe security of the country. He pointed out that King was an instrument of theCommunist Party, and he wanted it proved that King had a relationship with theSoviet bloc. Hoover also made it clear that he wanted evidence developed thatwould prove that King was embezzling or misusing large sums of money contributedto him and his organization.According to Sullivan, FBI agents jumped to please the director. He noted, “Wegave him what he wanted—under the threat of being out on the street if we didn’tagree.”Hoover’s vendetta continued against King until the black leader was himself cutdown by an assassin’s bullet in 1968. Behind this vendetta was COINTELPRO,Hoover’s secret counterintelligence program, created in part “to expose,disrupt, misdirect, or otherwise neutralize” King and his Southern ChristianLeadership Conference. Suspicions that Hoover’s FBI or some other part of thefederal government played a role in King’s death were heightened in 1999 when aMemphis jury found Memphis restaurant owner Loyd Jowers guilty of arranging anassassination plot also involving governmental agencies. In the wake of theverdict, King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, echoed allegations in the Kennedyassassination by stating:There is abundant evidence of a major high-level conspiracy in the assassinationof my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. . . . The conspiracy of the Mafia, local,state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassinationof my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identifiedsomeone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up totake the blame.Also secretly targeted for careful scrutiny under this program were PresidentKennedy and Hoover’s own boss, attorney general Robert Kennedy.According to Sullivan, “Hoover was desperately trying to catch Bobby red-handedat anything . . . and was always gathering damaging material on Jack Kennedy,which the President, with his active social life, seemed more than willing toprovide.”Both Kennedy brothers eventually supported King and the civil rights program asthey came to realize that its adoption as official policy was inevitable. AsKennedy biographer John H. Davis pointed out, “The most potentially dangerousenemy to emerge from Kennedy’s civil rights policy was the FBI and itsdirector.”From the ranks of angered segregationists came one man with a prophetic visionof Kennedy’s death.The Miami Prophet [Contents.html#rsec54]On November 9, 1963, a Miami police informant named William Somersett met withJoseph A. Milteer, a wealthy right-wing extremist who promptly began to outlinethe assassination of President Kennedy.Milteer was a leader of the archconservative National States Rights Party aswell as a member of other groups such as the Congress of Freedom and the WhiteCitizens’ Council of Atlanta. Somersett had infiltrated the States Rights’ Partyand secretly recorded Milteer’s conversation.The tape, later turned over to Miami police, recorded Milteer stating duringKennedy’s impending visit to Miami, “You can bet your bottom dollar he is goingto have a lot to say about the Cubans, there are so many of them here. . . . Themore bodyguards he has, the easier it is to get him . . . from an officebuilding with a high-powered rifle. . . . He knows he’s a marked man.”Somersett said, “They are really going to try to kill him?” Milteer responded,“Oh, yeah, it’s in the works. . . . (An investigation) wouldn’t leave any stoneunturned there, no way. They will pick up somebody within hours afterward . . .just to throw the public off.” Captain Charles Sapp, head of Miami’s PoliceIntelligence Bureau, was concerned enough with Milteer’s remarks to alert boththe FBI and the Secret Service.Again, apparently no word of this right-wing plot reached Secret Service agentsinvolved in Kennedy’s Dallas trip. In later years, however, Sapp recalled thatplans for a Miami motorcade were scrapped and the president instead flew to ascheduled speech by helicopter.On the day of the assassination, Milteer telephoned Somersett, saying he was inDallas and that Kennedy was due there shortly. Milteer commented that Kennedywould never be seen in Miami again.While the House Select Committee on Assassinations was unable to confirmMilteer’s presence in Dallas during the assassination, it also failed to provehe was elsewhere. Texas researcher Jack White claimed to have located aphotograph of a man bearing a striking resemblance to Milteer standing in thecrowd near the Texas School Book Depository.Back in Miami after the assassination, Milteer again met with Somersett andsaid, “Everything ran true to form. I guess you thought I was kidding you when Isaid he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle. . . . I don’tdo any guessing.” Milteer said not to worry about the capture of Oswald,“because he doesn’t know anything.” “The right-wing is in the clear,” addedMilteer. “The patriots have outsmarted the communist group in order that thecommunists would carry out the plan without the right wing becoming involved.”The FBI questioned Milteer on November 27 and he denied making any suchstatements. And while some information of the Milteer incident was belatedlyturned over to the Warren Commission, there is no mention of Milteer in itsreport or twenty-six volumes. Before the prophetic Milteer could be questionedfurther about his apparent foreknowledge of Kennedy’s assassination, he diedafter receiving burns when a heater exploded in a vacation cabin.The Milteer episode raises a number of questions, not the least of which is whyhis specific knowledge of a threat against the president—tape-recorded by apolice agency—was not passed along to FBI and Secret Service personnel inDallas.[images/line.jpg]But the racial unrest that rocked the United States in the 1960s was notPresident Kennedy’s only domestic problem. He was being verbally attacked notonly by poor minorities with rising expectations, but also by wealthybusinessmen who felt threatened by his announced social reforms.Big business was already leery of Kennedy, who as a senator had opposed theTaft-Hartley law, aimed at curbing the power of labor unions, and who aspresident had failed to consult the business world before making certainappointments. The fears of big business increased in the spring of 1962 whenKennedy used the power of the presidency to force US steel manufacturers to rollback recent price increases.Kennedy already had served notice on the giant steel companies in September1961, when he sent a letter to industry leaders warning them against any priceincreases. In his letter, Kennedy rationalized:The steel industry, in short, can look forward to good profits without anincrease in prices. Since 1947, iron and steel common stocks prices have risen397 percent; this is a much better performance than common stock prices ingeneral.On April 6, 1962, at the request of the federal government, the SteelworkersUnion agreed to limit its wage demands to a ten-cent hourly increase beginningthat summer. Then on April 11, US Steel and five other major steel companiesannounced a 3.5 percent hike in the cost of steel. Incensed, Kennedy told thenews media:The American people will find it hard, as I do, to accept a situation in which atiny handful of steel executives, whose pursuit of private power and profitexceeds their sense of public responsibility, can show such utter contempt forthe interest of 185 million Americans.Administration officials suggested an FBI investigation and on April 13, theDefense Department awarded a $5 million contract to a smaller steel firm thathad not raised prices. The next day, the six major firms announced their priceincrease had been rescinded.Kennedy’s denunciation of the steel executives sent shock waves through thebusiness community. He had demonstrated that a proactive president couldinfluence major corporate decisions. A US News and World Report editor wrote,“What happened is frightening not only to steel people but to industrygenerally. . . . President Kennedy had the public interest at heart in acting ashe did, but the results may not in the long run be what he intended them to be.”Other results of the Kennedy administration were infuriating corporateexecutives. Mergers were becoming widespread in the business world and AttorneyGeneral Kennedy and his trust busters were taking a dim view of them.During 1963, the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division won forty-five offorty-six cases; asked a federal court to force General Motors Corporation todispose of its locomotive business while charging the firm with monopolizing themanufacture and sale of intercity buses; and ordered General Dynamics to drop adivision dealing with industrial gases.Business and political leaders began to regret that the winner of the 1960presidential election had not been Richard M. Nixon.Nixon and the JFK Assassination [Contents.html#rsec55]Most Americans remember Richard Milhous Nixon as the only US president to resignhis office under the threat of certain impeachment.Few know of or recall Nixon’s connection with the Kennedy assassination,including that Nixon was in Dallas the day Kennedy died but couldn’t recall thatfact when interviewed by the FBI on February 28, 1964. United PressInternational reported the day after the assassination, “Richard Nixon, theformer vice president who lost the presidential election to President Kennedy in1960, is shown Friday after he arrived at Idlewild Airport [now John F. KennedyInternational] in New York following a flight from Dallas, Tex., where he hadbeen on a business trip.”Born January 9, 1913, in Yorba Linda, California, Nixon was a self-made man whoreached the pinnacles of power after struggling up from a background of meagerfinancial circumstances.Nixon wanted to attend Harvard like young Kennedy, but was forced to settle forCalifornia’s Whittier College, where he honed his skills as a debater. He wenton to graduate from Duke University Law School in Durham, North Carolina, thenunsuccessfully tried to join the FBI.Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Nixon took a job with the tire-rationing departmentof the Office of Price Administration in Washington. It is interesting thatNixon’s lifelong friend, Florida entrepreneur Charles “Bebe” Rebozo, began hisprofitable career selling recapped tires. Although Nixon claimed he did not meetRebozo until 1948 while vacationing in Florida after the Alger Hiss spy case,some researchers say the pair were in contact during the war.Later in the war, Nixon enlisted in the Navy and served in the South Pacific,where on one island he built a small shack used for high-stakes gambling anddrinking.In 1946, Nixon successfully ran for Congress after labeling his opponent,incumbent congressman Jerry Voorhis, a “friend of the communists.” With hisanticommunist credentials, Nixon was immediately named to the House Un-AmericanActivities Committee, where his name became nationally known due to his part inthe case of Alger Hiss, a government official accused of being a Soviet spy.By 1950, the ambitious Nixon was ready to run for a Senate seat. His opponentwas a liberal former Hollywood actress named Helen Douglas. Nixon paintedDouglas as a friend of communism and dubbed her the “pink lady.” He accused herof voting with a “notorious communist-line congressman” from New York, failingto mention that Nixon himself had voted with this same congressman 112 times.Such campaign tactics earned Nixon the epithet “Tricky Dick.” But they alsoproved effective. Nixon beat Douglas by nearly 700,000 votes.The man most responsible for Nixon’s smear tactics was his close friend andcampaign manager Murray Chotiner, a lawyer who represented ranking mobsters andwho had connections leading back to reputed New Orleans Mafia chief CarlosMarcello and Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa.In 1952, after only six years in politics, Nixon became vice president underDwight Eisenhower, thanks to the support of his political mentor, former NewYork governor Thomas Dewey, and his undermining of the favorite-son candidacy offellow Californian Earl Warren.Throughout the Eisenhower years, the war-hero president snubbed Nixon bothpolitically and socially. In 1960, when Eisenhower was asked what majordecisions Nixon had participated in, he caustically replied, “If you give me aweek, I might think of one.”But Nixon was busy building up his own power base with men of dubiousbackgrounds.In his memoirs, mobster Mickey Cohen wrote that he gave Chotiner $5,000 forNixon’s 1946 congressional campaign and raised $75,000 from Las Vegas gamblersfor Nixon’s 1950 Senate race.Furthermore, Ed Partin, a former aide to Jimmy Hoffa turned governmentinformant, detailed a meeting between Hoffa and New Orleans mob boss CarlosMarcello at the height of the 1960 presidential campaign: “I was right there,listening to the conversation. Marcello had a suitcase filled with $500,000 cashwhich was going to Nixon. It was a half-million-dollar contribution. The otherhalf [of a promised $1 million] was coming from the mob boys in New Jersey andFlorida.”Nixon’s organized-crime contacts apparently continued even after he resigned thepresidency in disgrace. During a 1975 golf tournament at La Costa Country Clubin California, Nixon’s golfing companions included Allen Dorfman, a mob-Teamsterfinancial coordinator, and Tony Provenzano, a former Teamster official andconvicted Mafia killer.Investigative authors Carl Oglesby, Howard Kohn, David Scheim, and others haverevealed that Nixon was a frequent visitor to Cuba during the early 1950s andwas in contact with confederates of organized-crime financial wizard MeyerLansky.When Fidel Castro gained power in Cuba, Lansky was one of those mob chieftainswho wanted him overthrown. An attempt with CIA officers to plan an invasion ofCuba was initiated by Eisenhower’s White House political action officer, RichardNixon. In his book Six Crises, Nixon wrote, “The covert training of Cuban exilesby the CIA was due in substantial part, at least, to my efforts. This had beenadopted as a policy as a result of my direct support.”Before the invasion could be launched, a serious snag occurred for Nixon and hisbackers—he lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy.Rather than bide his time waiting for the next presidential election, Nixon ranagainst Pat Brown for the California governorship in 1962. He was handilydefeated, especially after news broke of a secret $200,000 loan from billionaireHoward Hughes to Nixon’s brother.Within two years, Nixon was back on the political stage, campaigning forRepublican candidates. GOP stalwarts repaid this activity by again nominatingRichard Nixon for president in August 1968. By then, of course, both John andRobert Kennedy were dead.During the Nixon years, his friends in organized crime were not forgotten. TheNixon administration intervened in at least twenty trials of crime figures,ostensibly to protect “intelligence sources and methods.” In 1973, Nixon’sattorney general, Richard Kleindienst, denied an FBI request to continue anelectronic surveillance operation that was beginning to penetrate connectionsbetween the Mafia and the Teamsters. Neither did Nixon forget his friend JimmyHoffa, whom he pardoned in 1971 despite recommendations against such action.But of all Nixon’s possible crime connections, the most intriguing involves JackRuby, the killer of Lee Harvey Oswald. In 1975, Trowbridge Ford, a politicalscience associate professor at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,Massachusetts, was poring over a stack of recently released FBI documents. Fordwas astonished to discover a memorandum written by a bureau staff assistant to agovernment panel looking into organized-crime activity in 1947. The memo stated:It is my sworn statement that one Jack Rubenstein of Chicago, noted as apotential witness for hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities,is performing information functions for the staff of congressman Richard Nixon,Republican of California. It is requested Rubenstein not be called for opentestimony in the aforementioned hearings.Later in 1947, Chicago’s Rubenstein moved to Dallas and shortened his name toJack Ruby.The idea that Jack Ruby had worked for Nixon should have set off the nationalnews media. Instead, FBI officials told Ford that the document he discovered wasa fake and the story was quickly dropped. Here once again we see an FBIstatement admitting that fake or phony documents reside in its files.By the early 1980s, Ford told this author he had studied literally thousands ofgenuine FBI documents and had slowly come to the conclusion that the Nixon-Rubymemo was probably legitimate. Regardless, the matter raises even more suspicionwhen viewed with Nixon’s presence in Dallas the day Kennedy died.On November 20, 1963, Nixon arrived in Dallas, where a convention of theAmerican Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages was being held. A newsman from theDallas Times Herald interviewed Nixon and wrote:The former Vice President arrived in Dallas Wednesday night to attend a boardmeeting of Pepsi-Cola Company, which is represented by his New York lawpartnership. He plans to leave Dallas Friday morning a few hours before thearrival of President Kennedy. Mr. Nixon said that although he planned to talk bytelephone to several Dallas Republican leaders, he had no plans for a formalmeeting with them.Interestingly, researcher Richard Sprague examined Pepsi-Cola corporate recordsand found no board meeting was held in Dallas in 1963.The connections and politics of Pepsi-Cola deserve serious attention fromassassination researchers. The soft-drink company’s advertising was handled byJ. Walter Thompson, the giant public relations firm that also worked to sell thePentagon’s brand of “peace.”Nixon was longtime friends with Pepsi-Cola president Don Kendall and, later asUS president, it was Nixon who opened the lucrative Soviet soft-drink market toPepsi. A Justice Department investigation into this transaction revealed that a“high government official had all the red tape done away with so Pepsico couldobtain the Soviet franchise without any competition.”Pepsi went on to help those who had helped the company. In 1973, Kendall formedthe Save the Presidency Committee, which sought to protect Nixon from the wrathof Watergate investigations.It is especially interesting to note that Cartha DeLoach, the FBI official whowas chief liaison between Director Hoover and President Lyndon Johnson, laterjoined Pepsi-Cola.With Nixon in Dallas was Pepsi-Cola heiress and actress Joan Crawford. BothNixon and Crawford made comments in the Dallas newspapers to the effect thatthey, unlike the president, didn’t need Secret Service protection, and theyintimated that the nation was upset with Kennedy’s policies. It has beensuggested that this taunting may have been responsible for Kennedy’s criticaldecision not to have the Plexiglas top placed on his limousine on November 22.Nixon also caused a stir in Dallas when he suggested that Lyndon Johnson wouldbe dropped from the 1964 Democratic national ticket. Quoted in the November 22,1963, Dallas Morning News, Nixon stated, “We must remember that PresidentKennedy and his advisers are practical politicians. . . . Lyndon was chosen in1960 because he could help the ticket in the South. Now he is becoming apolitical liability in the South, just as he is in the North.”On the morning of November 22, Nixon was driven to Love Field in Dallas, wherehe boarded American Airlines Flight 82 for New York. Less than two hours afterNixon left, Air Force One landed at Love Field with the doomed Kennedy.Three months later, the Warren Commission asked the FBI to investigate MarinaOswald’s allegation that her husband had tried to kill Nixon during a visit toDallas. The FBI report dealing with Nixon’s interview stated:On February 28, 1964, the Honorable Richard M. Nixon, former Vice President ofthe US, was contacted by Assistant Director in charge of the New York Office,John F. Malone, and furnished the following information:Mr. Nixon advised that the only time he was in Dallas, Texas, during 1963 wastwo days prior to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.The question of whether Nixon was merely forgetful or dissembling in his commentto the FBI might have been cleared up by yet another bureau report, “Letter ofFBI of June 29, 1964, concerning Richard Nixon.” However, this document wasreported missing from the National Archives in 1976.Nixon’s recollection improved during a 1967 interview with journalist JulesWitcover. Speaking about the assassination, Nixon said:I was in a taxicab when I got the news. I had been in Dallas attending ameeting. I flew back to New York the next morning. It must have happened just asmy plane was landing. My cab stopped for a light in Queens and a guy ran overand said, “Have you got a radio? The President’s been wounded.” I thought, “Oh,my God, it must have been one of the nuts.” A half hour later I got to myapartment and the doorman told me he was dead. I called J. Edgar Hoover andasked him, “What happened? Was it one of the nuts?” Hoover said, “No, it was acommunist.”The supposed attack on Nixon by Oswald undoubtedly is one of the more ludicrousincidents of the Warren Commission investigation—and it is a prime example ofthe unreliability of Marina Oswald’s testimony.In early February 1964, when Marina Oswald first testified to the Commission,she failed to mention the incident when asked if her husband had expressed anyhostility toward any official of the United States. In June, her memory joggedby an FBI report from Oswald’s brother Robert, she said that just a few daysbefore Oswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he had put on a good suitafter reading a morning newspaper. She told the Commission:I saw that he took a pistol. I asked him where he was going and why he wasgetting dressed. He answered, “Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.” .. . I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I wanted to preventhim and then I started to cry. And I told him that he shouldn’t do this, andthat he had promised me.She told the Commission she locked him in the bathroom to prevent him fromtrying to shoot Nixon. However, as confirmed by an FBI investigation, thebathroom—like all others—locked from the inside. Accordingly, in a subsequentinterview with the Commission, Marina amended her story by saying she held thebathroom door for hours to prevent Oswald from leaving.The Commission, upon learning that Nixon was not even in Dallas at any time nearthis incident, decided that Marina may have been mistaken and that the target ofOswald’s pistol may have been Vice President Johnson, who had visited Dallas onApril 23.In an Oval Office meeting on June 23, 1972—just five days after theNixon-connected burglars were caught in the Watergate office complex—Nixon spokewith his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, saying, “Of course, this Hunt[Watergate burglar and CIA liaison with the anti-Castro Cubans E. Howard Hunt],that will uncover a lot of things. You open that scab, there’s a hell of a lotof things, and we feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing goany further. . . . The President believes that it is going to open the whole Bayof Pigs thing up again.”After telling Nixon that the FBI was aware of CIA operatives’ involvement in theWatergate affair, Haldeman told his chief, “The problem is it tracks back to theBay of Pigs and it tracks back to some other, the leads run out to people whohad no involvement in this, except by contracts and connection, but it gets intoareas that are liable to be realized.”What could Nixon and Haldeman have been talking about? The “whole Bay of Pigsthing” had been over for more than ten years. Nixon was out of office when theactual invasion began and the assault’s disastrous consequences were a matter ofhistorical record. Could they have been circuitously referring to theinterlocking connections between CIA agents, anti-Castro Cubans, and mobstersthat likely resulted in the Kennedy assassination? Did they themselves have somesort of insider knowledge of this event?Haldeman appeared to answer these questions a year later in his 1994 book, TheHaldeman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White House. He wrote, “It seems that in allof those Nixon references to the Bay of Pigs, he was actually referring to theKennedy assassination.”It also is significant to recall that when Hunt later demanded $2 million tokeep quiet about what he knew, Nixon agreed and the money was raised. Some ofthis money was being ferried by Hunt’s first wife, Dorothy, when she died in thecrash of United Airlines Flight 553 in December 1972.It may also be significant to consider the number of people connected with theWarren Commission who were hired or considered for employment by Nixon’s circleduring Watergate.Nixon White House counsel John Dean’s lawyer was Commission administrative aideCharles N. Shaffer; Nixon counsel John Ehrlichman hired Commission seniorcounsel Joseph Ball as his lawyer; Nixon initially wanted Commission generalcounsel J. Lee Rankin as Watergate prosecutor, then wanted Commission memberJohn McCloy but later accepted Commission special counsel Leon Jaworski (whorepresented Texas Attorney General Waggoner Carr); Nixon named Rankin to “edit”White House tapes; Nixon accepted Commission senior counsel Albert E. Jenner aschief minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee considering Nixon’simpeachment; and Nixon asked Commission counsel Arlen Specter to help with hisdefense.Specter, the former senator from Pennsylvania, was the chief architect of thecontroversial “single-bullet theory” for the Warren Commission. He was a protégéof Nixon’s attorney general, John Mitchell, and had served as co-chairman of thePennsylvania division of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) in1972.Commission attorney David Belin—long its most ardent supporter—headed Lawyersfor Nixon.In the final days of Watergate, organized-crime investigator Dan E. Moldearevealed that military authorities, including Nixon’s chief of staff, GeneralAlexander Haig, began to connect their chief with several mobsters, includingFlorida’s Santos Trafficante, believed responsible for setting up heroin routesfrom Vietnam and making payoffs to Nixon associates.Moldea quoted a Justice Department official as saying:The whole goddamn thing is too frightening to think about. We’re talking aboutthe President of the United States . . . a man who pardoned organized crimefigures after millions were spent by the government putting them away, a guywho’s had these connections since he was a congressman in the 1940s. I guess thereal shame is that we’ll never know the whole story, it’ll never come out.In a final nose-thumbing to the American people, Nixon appointed former WarrenCommission member Gerald R. Ford as vice president after Spiro Agnew resigned in1973 under tax evasion charges.One of Ford’s first public actions was to pardon Nixon of any crimes—past,present, or future.[images/line.jpg]If there was a plot to assassinate Kennedy, wouldn’t someone have become awareof it?There are many indications that in the fall of 1963, certain persons did.We already have learned of persons seemingly aware of Kennedy’s impending death,such as racist J. A. Milteer. It appears that some corporate leaders also mayhave been aware of Kennedy’s fate.A Killing on Wall Street [Contents.html#rsec56]In the thirty minutes following Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas, the Dow Jonesaverage fell more than 21.16 points. An estimated 6 million shares of stockchanged hands, wiping out about $15 billion in paper values on the New YorkStock Exchange alone. It was the greatest stock market panic since 1929. Thepanic and confusion was such that the Securities and Exchange Commission closedthe stock exchange shortly after 2 p.m., more than eighty minutes before normalclosing time. It was the first emergency shutdown of the stock market sinceAugust 1933.A few sharp investors—or perhaps individuals with knowledge of what was tocome—had taken “short” positions in scattered areas of the market. That is, somestocks unaccountably were sold before the market dropped, indicating some peoplemay have had advance word that something momentous was about to happen and thatstock values would drop.When the stock market reopened on November 26, 1963—just four days after theassassination—the New York Stock Exchange made a record $21 billion advance,more than regaining the losses incurred the day Kennedy died. It was the biggestsingle-day rise in the history of the stock market. More huge profits were made.No one has publicly identified the men who made their own private killing in thestock market, but it has been estimated that the profits made on November 22alone totaled more than $500 million.At least one author has suggested that the immense amount of money that changedhands on November 22, 1963, was the motivation behind Kennedy’s death. And whilemost researchers reject this idea, many do believe that certainindividuals—using insider information on the impending assassination—could notresist the temptation to profit from the tragedy.[images/line.jpg]Another overlooked aspect of Kennedy’s attempt to reform American societyinvolves money.At the time of the War Between the States, president Abraham Lincoln found thebig banks demanded high interest rates, from 24 to 36 percent, to fund the war.Rather than saddle the nation with unredeemable debt, he ordered the US Treasuryto issue new legal tender—United States notes. Previously, demand notes had beenissued. They were simply promissory paper redeemable for gold or silver. UnitedStates notes, the longest serving paper money in US history, were fiat notes,money issued through the treasury backed only by faith in the federalgovernment. Under Lincoln’s orders, these new notes, popularly known asgreenbacks, replaced demand notes. The greenback currency worked so well thatpolitical struggles and court cases continued into the late 1870s, when silvercertificates again began to be issued.Kennedy understood, as did Lincoln, that by returning to the Constitution, whichstates that only Congress shall coin and regulate money, the soaring nationaldebt could be reduced by not paying interest to the bankers of the FederalReserve System, who print paper money, then loan it to the government atinterest. He moved in this area on June 4, 1963, by signing Executive Order (EO)11110 authorizing the Treasury Department to start printing and issuing silvercertificates based on the remaining silver in the US Treasury and the CommodityCredit Corporation. Gold-backed currency in the United States had ended in 1933.Kennedy’s executive order stated:The authority vested in the President by paragraph (b) of section 43 of the Actof May 12, 1933, as amended (31 USC. 821(b)), to issue silver certificatesagainst any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasurynot then held for redemption of an outstanding silver certificates, to prescribethe denominations of such silver certificates, and to coin standard silverdollars and subsidiary silver currency for their redemption, and (b) By revokingsubparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 thereof.There has been considerable confusion and misunderstanding over EO 11110. Fromthe available evidence—and there appears to be missing and even altereddata—with this order JFK was making a surreptitious effort to returnmoney-creation power from the privately owned Federal Reserve to the TreasuryDepartment.On the surface, EO 11110 appeared to be a simple change to president HarryTruman’s Executive Order 10289 of 1951, which gave such power to the treasurythrough the issuance of treasury silver certificates. This silver, more than$100 million worth accumulated largely through reparations from World War I, wasto be put in storage under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 and amendedby the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. These acts also fully created the CommodityCredit Corporation and the Exchange Stabilization Fund, both of which held hugesums of money, some of which was being used for purposes such as funding covertintelligence activities.In other words, EO 11110 allowed the treasury full access to silver certificatesfrom the bowels of Fort Knox and would have drastically lowered the USgovernment loan rate—and by inference interest payments—to the Federal Reserve.JFK was seeking to ease the inflation rate and this one order (EO 11110) wouldhave accomplished just that. This would have placed more silver into the generalpopulation and paid off debt to the Federal Reserve.JFK’s EO 11110 expanded the Treasury Department’s power to issuenon-interest-bearing money from governmental reserves and edged out the US needto approach the Federal Reserve to print more interest-bearing Federal Reservenotes.EO 11110 therefore allowed for the issuance of $4,292,893,815 in silver-backedtreasury bills, called United States notes. That same day, Kennedy also signed abill changing the backing of $1 and $2 bills from silver to gold, addingstrength to the weakening US currency. Kennedy’s successor, President Johnson,did nothing to change this situation. It was President Ronald Reagan who inSeptember 1987 issued EO 12608 as part of a general clean-up of executiveorders. EO 12608 revoked the section added by EO 11110. This effectively revokedthe entire order. Today we continue to use interest-bearing Federal Reservenotes, and the deficit is more than $16 trillion, an all-time high.The upshot of all this seemed to be Kennedy’s attempt to increase the monetaryand credit supply by infusing the economy with United States notes issuedthrough the treasury rather than the private interest-charging Federal ReserveSystem.And the fact remains that such interest-free United States notes were indeedissued and Kennedy showed signs of attempting to undercut the power of theheretofore unassailable Federal Reserve System.Kennedy’s comptroller of the currency, James J. Saxon, had been at odds with thepowerful Federal Reserve Board for some time, encouraging broader investment andlending powers for banks that were not part of the Federal Reserve System. Saxonalso had decided that non-Reserve banks could underwrite state and local generalobligation bonds, again weakening the dominant Federal Reserve banks.Considering that the battle over US monetary control by a monolithic centralbank dates back to the founding of the Republic, some assassination researchersbelieve Kennedy’s little-noted efforts to reform the money supply and curtailthe Federal Reserve System may have cost him much more than just the enmity ofthe all-powerful international bankers. Many assassination researchers feel itwas not a mere coincidence that Lincoln and Kennedy, the only two US presidentswho attempted to issue interest-free money, were both shot in the head inpublic.President Kennedy inched farther out on a limb with big business on January 17,1963, when he presented both his administration’s budget and proposals for taxreform that included a tax cut.Kennedy’s tax proposals included relieving the tax burden of low-income andelderly persons, revising tax treatment of capital gains for a better flow ofcapital funds, and broadening the base of individual and corporate income taxesto remove special privileges and loopholes and even to do away with the oildepletion allowance.This last possibility brought the beleaguered president into directconfrontation with one of the most powerful and single-minded groups inAmerica—wealthy oilmen.Kennedy and Oilmen [Contents.html#rsec57]The history of oil is replete with stories of unbounded greed, businesschicanery, and even violence.In 1923, the first major oil scandal occurred when it was discovered thatpresident Warren G. Harding’s secretary of the interior, Albert B. Fall, hadaccepted money from oilmen in exchange for secretly leasing drilling rights ongovernment land in Wyoming known as the Teapot Dome.By 1933, there were calls to make the vital oil industry a public utility withgovernmental controls. One of the men supporting this move was presidentFranklin Roosevelt’s secretary of the interior, Harold Ickes. However, FDR wasfinally turned against the plan by Texas congressman Sam Rayburn, LyndonJohnson’s mentor, who faithfully represented Texas oil interests in Washington.After World War II, the Marshall Plan began turning recovering European nationsaway from coal to oil. Refining capacity in Europe tripled in just a few years.In 1950, a secret agreement was reached between the State Department and majoroil companies that allowed all royalties paid to Arab nations to be applied astax credits.Dwight Eisenhower was elected with strong support from the oil industry and,early in 1953, in one of his first actions, he stopped a grand juryinvestigation into the “international Petroleum Cartel,” citing reasons of“national security.”The same year, a CIA-backed coup reinstated the Shah of Iran and new oilarrangements were made with Iran. Ironically, the Iranian coup was mastermindedby Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy’s grandson, who went on to become a vice president ofGulf Oil. The Suez Crisis in 1956 signaled the end of British and Frenchcolonialism in the Middle East, and the major oil companies moved to consolidatetheir power.When John F. Kennedy became president in 1961, the oil industry felt secure.But then President Kennedy began to assault the power of the oil giantsdirectly, first with a law known as the Kennedy Act, and later by attacking theoil depletion allowance. The Kennedy Act, passed on October 16, 1962, removedthe distinction between repatriated profits and profits reinvested abroad. Bothwere now subject to US taxation. The measure also was aimed at preventingtaxable income from being hidden away in foreign subsidiaries and other taxhavens. While this law applied to industry as a whole, it particularly affectedthe oil companies, which were greatly diversified with large overseasoperations.By the end of 1962, oilmen estimated their earnings on foreign investmentcapital would fall to 15 percent, compared with 30 percent in 1955.One of the most sacred of provisions in the eyes of oilmen was the oil depletionallowance, which permitted oil producers to treat up to 27.5 percent of theirincome as tax exempt. In theory this was to compensate for the depletion offixed oil reserves but, in effect, it gave the oil industry a lower tax rate.Under this allowance, an oilman with a good deal of venture capital could becomerich with virtually no risk. For example, a speculator could drill ten wells. Ifnine were dry holes and only the tenth struck oil, he would still make moneybecause of tax breaks and the depletion allowance.It was estimated at the time that oilmen might lose nearly $300 million a yearif the depletion allowance was diminished. Attempts to eliminate or reduce thedepletion allowance were rebuffed year after year by congressmen, many of whomwere the happy recipients of oil-industry contributions.Speaking of his tax reform act of 1963, President Kennedy pointed the finger atthe oil companies, saying, “No one industry should be permitted to obtain anundue tax advantage over all others.”Included in Kennedy’s tax package were provisions for closing a number ofcorporate tax loopholes, including the depletion allowance. Needless to say,oilmen both in Texas and elsewhere felt threatened by Kennedy and his policies.Kennedy’s use of his personal power against the steel manufacturers had shownthem that the young president meant to enforce his will in these matters.John W. Curington, who for twelve years was special assistant to Dallas oilbillionaire H. L. Hunt, reported in 1977, “Hunt was often heard by top aides andfollowers to say that America would be much better off without Kennedy.”Curington, whose statements were assessed as truthful by Psychological StressEvaluator analysis, also said the oilman sent him to check on Oswald’s policesecurity while in custody and was “elated” to find it was lax. Curington also isconvinced that he saw Marina Oswald coming from Hunt’s private offices severalweeks after the assassination.Hunt’s former assistant said he believes that the wealthy oilman unwittinglyinfluenced right-wing followers to participate in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.He added that in later years, Hunt admitted that he knew an assassinationconspiracy existed.Angry talk in the corporate boardrooms may have grown into deadly plots on golfcourses and at private parties. But despite their unparalleled wealth and power,oilmen could not have moved against Kennedy on their own. They needed allieswithin government and within the intelligence community and the military. Suchallies were there—among the anti-Castro Cubans, in the CIA, in organized crime,in the Pentagon and even within the federal government—and all were mostreceptive to the idea of a change of leadership. Lyndon Johnson was especiallysympathetic to oilmen, many of whom were fellow Texans and financialcontributors.[images/line.jpg]One man with connections to government, intelligence, and the oil industry wasDallas oil geologist George DeMohrenschildt, identified by the Warren Commissionas the last-known close friend to Lee Harvey Oswald.Oswald’s Friends [Contents.html#rsec58]DeMohrenschildt—a man who was friends with both Jackie Kennedy’s family and herhusband’s alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald—is perhaps the most intriguingperson in the entire cast of characters connected with the Kennedyassassination.Despite this fascinating link, little was said about DeMohrenschildt at the timeof the assassination as both he and his wife, Jeanne, were in Haiti during theevents in Dallas.A close study of DeMohrenschildt’s life shows a string of intelligenceconnections, raising the possibility that DeMohrenschildt may have played arole—perhaps unwittingly—in furthering plans for the assassination. Thispossibility may have come to haunt DeMohrenschildt in the days just prior to hissuspicious death in 1977.DeMohrenschildt—his family, originally named Mohrenskuld, was of Swedishextraction—was born April 17, 1911, in Mozyr, a small Baltic town in czaristRussia near the Polish border.An educated, sophisticated young man, DeMohrenschildt was introduced to manywealthy and influential Americans. He later told the Warren Commission:[I met] lots of people, but especially Mrs. [Janet] Bouvier. . . . Mrs. Bouvieris Jacqueline Kennedy’s mother, also [I met] her father and her whole family.[Mrs. Bouvier] was in the process of getting a divorce from her husband[Jackie’s father, John V. “Jack” Bouvier], I met him, also. We were very closefriends. We saw each other every day. I met Jackie then, when she was a littlegirl. [And] her sister, who was still in the cradle practically.After failing in attempts to sell insurance and perfume, DeMohrenschildttraveled by bus to Texas, where, thanks to family connections, he got a job withHumble Oil Company in Houston. Despite being friends with the chairman of theboard of Humble, young DeMohrenschildt was confined to working as a “roughneck”in the Louisiana oil fields. He quit after being injured and contracting amoebicdysentery.For years he claimed to have worked for French intelligence during the earlyyears of World War II—he said he was never an official agent but had helped agood friend, Pierre Freyss, the head of French counterintelligence. In 1941, hewas arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Nazi spy for sketching andphotographing military installations near Aransas Pass, Texas. In later years heconfessed to his wife that he had briefly worked for the Germans.DeMohrenschildt also became closely connected with many exiled Russians whojoined with the General Vlassov movement, anticommunist Russians who fought withthe Nazis in hope of recovering their homeland. Springing up in cities withlarge Russian exile communities, these people referred to themselves as“solidarists,” indicating the solidarity of their purpose. One of these groupsexisted in Dallas during the early 1960s, although DeMohrenschildt disclaimedbeing a member.The Vlassov organization was eventually absorbed by the Nazi spy system underGeneral Reinhard Gehlen; at the end of the war the system became a part of USintelligence. Many members of this apparatus ended up working for the CIA.DeMohrenschildt’s oil-related travels took him to France, Nigeria, Ghana, andTogoland.In 1957, despite an unflattering background check by the CIA, he journeyed toYugoslavia for the International Cooperation Administration, a branch of the USgovernment’s Agency for International Development. By this time, DeMohrenschildtapparently had some association with the agency, according to documents thatbecame public in the late 1970s.Researcher Michael Levy obtained one CIA memo from former agency deputy directorRichard Helms that states that DeMohrenschildt’s trip to Yugoslavia provided“foreign intelligence which was promptly disseminated to other federal agenciesin 10 separate reports.” Another CIA memo indicated that DeMohrenschildt alsofurnished lengthy reports on his later travels through Mexico and CentralAmerica.Shortly before leaving for Yugoslavia, DeMohrenschildt met another Russian exilewho lived in the same Dallas hotel with him. Jeanne Fromenke LeGon had alreadyestablished a career as a dancer and clothing designer. Her family, too, hadstrong political and defense-related connections. Her Russian father had builtthe first railroads in China and was connected with Nationalist politics therewhile her brother, Sergio, had worked on the super-secret Manhattan atomic bombproject. Her former husband, Robert LeGon, was connected to security work forDouglas Aircraft and their daughter, Christiana, was married to a vice presidentof Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.Jeanne and the outgoing DeMohrenschildt hit it off right away and she joined himin Yugoslavia. In a curious incident there, the couple was boating when theywere shot at by communist guards who became anxious when they came too close toMarshal Tito’s summer home. DeMohrenschildt claimed to have been simplysketching the shoreline.Returning to the United States, George and Jeanne were soon married and shortlyset off on an incredible odyssey through Central America.Back in Dallas in late 1961, the DeMohrenschildts were at the center ofprominent Dallasites. His business and social contacts read like a who’s who ofthe Texas oil community. DeMohrenschildt knew Dallas oil millionaires H. L. Huntand Clint Murchinson, John Mecom of Houston, Robert Kerr of Kerr-McGee, and JeanDe Menil, head of the worldwide oil firm Schlumberger Corporation. According toformer New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, arms and explosives the CIAsupplied to the anti-Castro Cuban exiles were hidden away in a Schlumbergerfacility near New Orleans in the summer of 1963.But most intriguing was DeMohrenschildt’s friendship with J. Walton Moore, amember of the CIA’s Domestic Contact Service.Moore, whom DeMohrenschildt described to the Warren Commission as “a governmentman—either FBI or Central Intelligence,” debriefed the geologist upon his returnfrom Yugoslavia and thereafter met with the DeMohrenschildts socially on manyoccasions. The Warren Commission, perhaps in an effort to deflect any attentionfrom the CIA, listed Moore as “G. Walter Moore.”After DeMohrenschildt first met Lee Harvey Oswald, he checked on the ex-Marinewith Moore. Less than two months after the assassination, DeMohrenschildt wroteto friends expressing shock and disbelief over Kennedy’s death: “Before we beganto help Marina and the child, we asked the FBI [he meant Moore but used the termFBI at that time, as the CIA was supposed to be secret] man in Dallas . . .about Lee and he told us that he was ‘completely harmless.’”These letters are part of DeMohrenschildt’s FBI file, indicating the bureau wasmonitoring him during this time. Following the assassination, his statementsthat he had checked on Oswald with the bureau apparently caused greatconsternation. Dallas FBI chief J. Gordon Shanklin even ordered agent JamesWoods to go to Haiti and obtained a lengthy statement from DeMohrenschildtdenying that he had ever spoken about Oswald to the bureau.DeMohrenschildt himself may have been the object of a secret investigation inthe months preceding Kennedy’s death. Once DeMohrenschildt noticed small pencilmarks on some of his papers and, convinced his home had been secretly entered,questioned Moore about it. Moore denied that government people had broken intoDeMohrenschildt’s home.Another close friend of DeMohrenschildt’s was Fort Worth attorney Max Clark, whoat that time was connected with security at General Dynamics.In later years, neither George nor Jeanne DeMohrenschildt could recall exactlywho first mentioned the Oswalds to them. But in the summer of 1962,DeMohrenschildt made a business trip to nearby Fort Worth and decided to visitthe Oswalds. He had learned through the Russian community in Dallas that theOswalds had recently arrived in this country from Minsk and he was eager fornews about the city of his youth.DeMohrenschildt was appalled at the poorly furnished “shack” in which theOswalds lived, but was impressed by Oswald’s command of Russian. He told theWarren Commission, “He spoke fluent Russian, but with a foreign accent, and mademistakes, grammatical mistakes but had remarkable fluency in Russian. . . .Remarkable—for a fellow of his background and education . . . he preferred tospeak Russian than English any time. He always would switch from English toRussian.”He said both his first impression of Oswald and his last were the same:I could never get mad at this fellow. . . . Sometimes he was obnoxious. I don’tknow. I had a liking for him. I always had a liking for him. There was somethingcharming about him, there was some—I don’t know. I just liked the guy—that isall. . . . With me he was very humble. If somebody expressed an interest in him,he blossomed, absolutely blossomed. If you asked him some questions about him,he was just out of this world. That was more or less the reason that I think heliked me very much.In 1976, his opinion of Oswald had not wavered. He told one researcher:No matter what they say, Lee Harvey Oswald was a delightful guy. They make amoron out of him, but he was smart as hell. Ahead of his time really, a kind ofhippie of those days. In fact, he was the most honest man I knew. And I willtell you this—I am sure he did not shoot the president.In 1963, the DeMohrenschildts embraced the Oswalds and visited them with an ideaof helping the struggling couple.It is interesting to note how the Dallas Russian community split in reacting tothe Oswalds. Most of them—being staunch anticommunists—wanted nothing to do witha man who had tried to defect to Russia. But some of the émigrémembers—especially those with intelligence connections, such asDeMohrenschildt—seemed quite at ease with the young would-be defector. Perhapsthey, too, had been assured that Oswald was “harmless.”In October 1962, DeMohrenschildt managed to move Oswald to Dallas, where hedropped out of sight for nearly a month. Marina was left with DeMohrenschildt’sdaughter and son-in-law, the Gary Taylors. Oddly, Oswald did not even inform hismother of the move and he told friends he had been fired from his job at LeslieWelding in Fort Worth when actually he had quit.Furthermore, during this time DeMohrenschildt was making regular trips toHouston, according to his friends Igor Voshinin and Paul Raigorodsky.Raigorodsky, a wealthy oilman and a director of the Tolstoy Foundation—ananticommunist organization of Russian exiles that was funded by the USgovernment—told the Warren Commission he asked DeMohrenschildt about hisfrequent Houston trips. Raigorodsky stated, “He told me he was going to seeHerman and George Brown. They are brothers.” The Brown brothers were owners ofBrown and Root Construction and close friends and financial contributors toLyndon Johnson. Jeanne DeMohrenschildt said the only reason they didn’t relocateto Houston during this time was her successful clothing business in Dallas.At the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Oswald went to work forJaggars-Chiles-Stovall, a Dallas printing and photographic firm that hadcontracts with the US Army Map Service. Although clearances were required towork in some areas of the plant, testimony before the Warren Commission showedsecurity was sloppy and apparently Oswald had access to sensitive material. Itwas here, it was believed, that Oswald manufactured false identification papersboth for himself and in the name A. J. Hidell, using company photographicequipment.He once asked fellow employee Dennis Ofstein if he knew what the term “microdot”meant. The word “microdot” was found written in Oswald’s address book next tothe entry for Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. When Ofstein replied no, Oswald proceededto explain that it was a special photographic process whereby a great mass ofdocuments could be reduced to the size of a dot. He said this technique was usedfrequently in espionage work. Ofstein wondered why Oswald would discuss such asubject.Through the Christmas holidays of 1962–1963, DeMohrenschildt continued to trywith only marginal success to get the Dallas Russian émigré community involvedwith the Oswalds.He apparently tried to separate the Oswalds and, on at least two occasions,tried to find living quarters for Marina and her children. But Marina decided toreunite with Oswald, much to the disgust of her friends in the Russiancommunity. On February 22, 1963, the DeMohrenschildts brought the Oswalds to thehome of Everett Glover, where Marina was introduced to Ruth Paine. Mrs. Painewas separated from her husband, Michael, an employee of Bell Helicopter, andexpressed an interest in seeing Marina again to learn the Russian language.Marina agreed and several visits between the women followed.According to the Warren Commission, Oswald ordered the Carcano rifle from amail-order firm under the name “A. Hidell” on March 12, 1963, and it arrived inDallas on March 25. Just sixteen days later, Oswald reportedly fired a shot atGeneral Walker.The Walker incident occurred on a Wednesday night. Oswald arrived back home thatevening and, according to Marina’s Warren Commission testimony, told her hefired at Walker and had then buried his rifle. The rifle discovered in the TexasSchool Book Depository showed no sign of being buried. It was clean andwell-oiled, yet no gun-cleaning material was ever found among Oswald’spossessions.And the following weekend, the rifle was observed in his home by JeanneDeMohrenschildt during a visit. She and her husband brought a pink bunny toy toOswald’s young daughter and Marina was showing her around their new apartmentwhen she saw a rifle in a closet. As Jeanne later recalled the incident, sheasked Marina, “What on earth is that?” Marina replied, “A rifle. Lee bought it.I don’t know why when we need money for food and things.” Asked what Oswald didwith the weapon, Jeanne said Marina answered, “He goes to the public park withlittle June [Oswald’s daughter] and shoots leaves with it.”Jeanne DeMohrenschildt later told this author:Today that sounds very strange, but at the time, I was thinking of the times Ihad fired guns at small targets in amusement parks and I really didn’t think toomuch of her answer. When I told George about the rifle I had seen in the closet,he immediately boomed out, “Did you take that pot shot at General Walker, Lee?”George then laughed loudly. Looking back on this incident today, Lee and Marinadid not appear to be shocked or upset. They merely stood there in silence whileGeorge laughed.DeMohrenschildt told the Warren Commission his question about shooting at Walkerwas “frankly a stupid joke on my part.” Marina told the Warren Commission thaton another occasion, DeMohrenschildt asked Oswald, “Lee, how is it possible thatyou missed?” However, both DeMohrenschildts denied such a question was everasked. It seems this may have been yet another example of Marina’s being coachedor misquoted by federal authorities.This visit was to be the last meeting between the DeMohrenschildts and theOswalds. On April 23, Marina moved in with the attentive Ruth Paine, and thenext day Oswald left Dallas by bus for New Orleans.About a week later, the DeMohrenschildts left for a new business venture inHaiti. As the DeMohrenschildts were preparing to leave for Haiti in May 1963,they stopped in Washington, where, according to CIA records, DeMohrenschildt metwith a CIA representative and the assistant director of Army intelligence. Whatspecifically was discussed at this meeting is not known, but at this same time,another CIA document shows that an agency officer “requested an expedite checkon George DeMohrenschildt.” At this meeting was DeMohrenschildt’s Haitianbusiness associate, Clemard Charles. Researchers have noted that Charles laterwas implicated in the sale of arms and military equipment involving a gunrunnernamed Edward Browder.According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Browder leased a B-25bomber under the name of a fictitious company and flew it to Haiti a year afterthe Kennedy assassination and later cashed a $24,000 check signed by Charles.Browder, a former Lockheed test pilot who served a twenty-five-year prisonsentence for “security violations,” told the committee he had been working forthe CIA. According to information gathered by author David E. Scheim, Browderalso was an associate of Jack Ruby in the 1950s when both men were arranging thesale of arms to Fidel Castro.Herb Atkin, a former CIA operative, has stated that DeMohrenschildt was involvedin a failed CIA plot to overthrow Haitian president Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalierin June 1963.Following DeMohrenschildt’s death in March 1977, Atkin told author Dick Russell,“I knew de Mohrenschildt as Philip Harbin. A lot of people in Washington haveclaimed that Harbin did not exist. But he’s the one that ran me from the latefifties onward. I’m certain that DeMohrenschildt was my case officer’s realname.”Recall that De Mohrenschildt’s fourth wife, Jeanne, was born in Harbin, China.The DeMohrenschildts were in Haiti when they learned of Kennedy’s death.Reportedly DeMohrenschildt told friends there the FBI was behind theassassination. Whether or not he actually made such a comment, he did start toexperience difficulties after Haitian president Duvalier reportedly received aletter from the FBI telling of DeMohrenschildt’s friendship with Oswald andlabeling him as a “Polish communist and a member of an international band.”The DeMohrenschildts were called to Washington to testify to the WarrenCommission in April 1964. Oddly enough, when DeMohrenschildt tried to raise theissue of the damaging FBI letter, Warren Commission attorney Albert Jennerquickly told him, “I would say you have been misinformed on that.”DeMohrenschildt replied, “Well, he did receive some kind of letter.” Jenner thensaid, “But nothing that would contain any such statements. . . . It may havebeen a crank letter, but nothing official.” DeMohrenschildt, catching the driftof Jenner’s remarks depreciating the whole subject, suddenly agreed: “Yes, I amsure it is nothing official. I am sure it could not have been anythingofficial.”Researchers are left with the question of how a Warren Commission attorney,supposedly searching for the truth of the Kennedy assassination, could have beenso confident that the FBI letter was a “crank” and why he had closed the subjectrather than trying to learn more about it.Jeanne DeMohrenschildt claimed the Warren Commission did not appear eager tohear from her and her husband and that they had to ask to testify. She told thisauthor:Much of our problems with government authorities came from our refusal toslander Lee’s name. The Warren Commission, along with the mass media, depictedOswald as a complete loner, a total failure, both as a man and a father. This isnot the impression George and I had of this man. Lee was a sincere person.Although from a modest educational background, he was quick and bright. . . .Lee obviously loved his daughter June. We could not possibly consider him asdangerous.During their stay in Washington, the DeMohrenschildts visited in the home ofJackie Kennedy’s mother, Mrs. Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, according to anunpublished book by DeMohrenschildt, said, “Incidentally, my daughter Jacquelinenever wants to see you again because you were close to her husband’s assassin.”Returning to Haiti, the DeMohrenschildt’s problems there increased to the pointthat in 1967 they were forced to sneak away from the island aboard a Germanfreighter, which brought them to Port Arthur, Texas. Here, according to Jeanne,the DeMohrenschildts were met by an associate of former Oklahoma senator andoilman Bob Kerr. The returning couple were extended the hospitality of Kerr’shome.By the 1970s, the DeMohrenschildts were living quietly in Dallas, although oncethey were questioned by two men who claimed to be from Life magazine. A checkshowed the men were phonies.DeMohrenschildt seemed content to teach French at Bishop College, apredominantly black school in south Dallas. Then in the spring of 1976, George,who suffered from chronic bronchitis, had a particularly bad attack. Distrustfulof hospitals, he was persuaded by someone—Jeanne later could not recall who—tosee a newly arrived doctor in Dallas named Dr. Charles Mendoza. After severaltrips to Mendoza in the late spring and summer, DeMohrenschildt’s bronchialcondition improved, but he began to experience the symptoms of a severe nervousbreakdown. He became paranoid, claiming that “the Jewish Mafia and the FBI” wereafter him.Alarmed, Jeanne accompanied her husband to Dr. Mendoza and discovered he wasgiving DeMohrenschildt injections and costly drug prescriptions. Jeanne said herhusband’s mental condition continued to deteriorate during this time. She nowclaims, “I have become convinced that this doctor, in some way, lies behind thenervous breakdown George suffered in his final months.”The doctor is indeed mysterious. A check with the Dallas County Medical Societyshowed that Dr. Mendoza first registered in April 1976, less than two monthsbefore he began treating DeMohrenschildt and at the same time the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations was beginning to be funded.Mendoza left Dallas in December, just a few months after DeMohrenschildt refusedto continue treatments, at his wife’s insistence. Mendoza left the society aforwarding address that proved to be nonexistent. He also left behind a confusedand unbalanced George DeMohrenschildt.During the fall of 1976 while in this unbalanced mental state, DeMohrenschildtcompleted his unpublished manuscript, I Am a Patsy! I Am a Patsy! after Oswald’sfamous remark to news reporters in the Dallas police station. In the manuscript,DeMohrenschildt depicts Oswald as a cursing, uncouth man with assassination onhis mind, a totally opposite picture from his descriptions of Oswald through theyears.The night he finished the manuscript, DeMohrenschildt attempted suicide bytaking an overdose of tranquilizers. Paramedics were called, but they declinedto take him to a hospital. They found DeMohrenschildt also had taken his dog’sdigitalis, which counteracted the tranquilizers.Shortly after his attempted suicide, Jeanne committed her husband to ParklandHospital in Dallas, where he was subjected to electroshock therapy. To gauge hismental condition at this time, consider what he told Parkland roommate CliffordWilson: “I know damn well Oswald didn’t kill Kennedy—because Oswald and I weretogether at the time.” DeMohrenschildt told Wilson that he and Oswald were indowntown Dallas watching the Kennedy motorcade pass when shots were fired. Hesaid that at the sound of shots Oswald ran away and DeMohrenschildt never sawhim again.This story, which was reported in the April 26, 1977, edition of the NationalEnquirer as “Exclusive New Evidence,” is simply untrue since both George andJeanne were at a reception in the Bulgarian embassy in Haiti the day Kennedy waskilled. But the incident serves to illustrate George DeMohrenschildt’s mentalcondition at the time.In early 1977, convinced that evil forces were still after him, DeMohrenschildtfled to Europe with Dutch journalist Willems Oltmans, who later created a furorby telling the House Select Committee on Assassinations that DeMohrenschildtclaimed he knew of Oswald’s assassination plan in advance.However, DeMohrenschildt grew even more fearful in Europe. In a letter foundafter his death, he wrote, “As I can see it now, the whole purpose of my meetingin Holland was to ruin me financially and completely.”In mid-March DeMohrenschildt fled to a relative’s Florida home leaving behindclothing and other personal belongings. It was in the fashionable Manalapan,Florida, home of his sister-in-law that DeMohrenschildt died of a shotgun blastto the head on March 29, 1977, just three hours after a representative of theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations tried to contact him there.Earlier that day, he had met author Edward J. Epstein for an interview. In a1983 Wall Street Journal article, Epstein wrote that DeMohrenschildt told himthat day that the CIA had asked him “to keep tabs on Oswald.” However, the thingthat may have triggered DeMohrenschildt’s fear was that Epstein showed him adocument that indicated DeMohrenschildt might be sent back to Parkland forfurther shock treatments, according to a statement by attorney David Bludworth,who represented the state during the investigation into DeMohrenschildt’s death.Although several aspects of DeMohrenschildt’s death caused chief investigatorCaptain Richard Sheets of the Palm County Sheriff’s Office to term the shooting“very strange,” a coroner’s jury quickly ruled suicide.One other matter that involved the DeMohrenschildts with the assassination hasproven as unfathomable as so many others. According to Jeanne, when theDeMohrenschildts arrived back in the United States in early 1967, theydiscovered a photograph of Oswald in some Russian-English language records theyhad loaned to Marina Oswald prior to leaving for Haiti. The picture is one ofthe famous backyard scenes depicting Oswald with his rifle and pistol whileholding a communist publication. It is one pose of at least three separatephotos believed by most researchers to be faked. On the back of the photo is oneinscription in English reading “To my friend George from Lee Oswald.” Beneaththis is an inscription in Russian Cyrillic script that translates “Hunter offascists Ha-ha-ha!!!”The photo also bears the date “5/IV/63,” apparently meaning April 5, 1963. Thedate is curious, mixing in Roman numerals as it does and written in the Europeanstyle. The New Orleans–born Oswald more likely would have written “4/5/63” and,in fact, a check of dozens of other examples of dates in Oswald’s mass ofwritten material shows not one written in the manner on the photo.Handwriting experts for the House Select Committee on Assassinations could notidentify Oswald, Marina, or the DeMohrenschildts as authors of the inscription.And Marina gave mixed accounts of the photo, which surfaced just at a time whenmany assassination researchers were first beginning to question the authenticityof the backyard photographs.While testifying to the committee in 1978, Marina suddenly blurted out, “Iremember being surprised at [Oswald] showing pictures like that to George[DeMohrenschildt], so apparently I saw them at the apartment. . . . Somethingstrikes my memory that—how dare he show pictures like that to a friend?”If her statement is true, and that’s a big “if” since later in her testimonyMarina suddenly could not remember much else about the episode, it would meanthat George DeMohrenschildt—the man with numerous intelligence connections—wasaware of Oswald’s possession of weapons months before the assassination.The DeMohrenschildts denied any knowledge of the photo with the incriminatinginscription, and Jeanne swore to this author neither she nor her husband eversaw the photograph until discovering it upon their return in 1967. She wasconvinced that the picture had been planted among their possessions.Looking over the fascinating life of George and Jeanne DeMohrenschildt, one isstruck by the idea that this sophisticated couple may be one of the biggest “redherrings” of the assassination, as DeMohrenschildt had numerous andlong-standing connections with intelligence—most notably the CIA and perhapsprivate intelligence groups connected with the oil industry and defense work.Through DeMohrenschildt, certain elements within oil, business, and intelligencecircles could have become aware of Oswald, who with his procommunist backgroundmust have appeared to be a prime candidate for an assassination patsy.After the assassination, DeMohrenschildt—with his connections to German, French,Polish, and US intelligence, wealthy right-wing Texas oilmen, and Caribbeanbusiness interests—provided a wonderful opportunity to draw investigators into alabyrinth of false leads. The mental deterioration near the end of his lifecaused DeMohrenschildt to make untrue statements that further clouded the issue.[images/line.jpg]If George DeMohrenschildt had a genuine liking for President Kennedy, as hestated on several occasions, this fondness was not shared by his conservativeoil and business associates. They felt threatened by the young president, whowas making decisions on finances, taxation, and foreign policy outside theircontrol. This concern was shared by the military and intelligence communities.President Kennedy’s shift from Cold Warrior to seeker of world peace is welldocumented in James W. Douglass’s 2008 book, JFK and the Unspeakable. Douglassdrew the term “unspeakable” from author and social activist Thomas Merton, anordained Catholic priest turned Trappist monk. The term refers to a hidden butinsidious ideology of fascism that has so permeated American society that itmust remain unmentioned in public. Douglass wrote, “The Vietnam War, the race toa global war, and the interlocking murders of John Kennedy, Malcolm X, MartinLuther King, and Robert Kennedy were all signs of the Unspeakable. It remainsdeeply present in our world.”Corporate heads initially may have been mollified to think that Kennedy wasbeing guided by the hand of his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, a pro-Nazi formerbootlegger and political boss. But in December 1961, Joseph Kennedy had a strokethat left him totally incapacitated. His son Jack was now in the highest officeof the land with no direct control over him.And the younger Kennedy was moving to restrict the predations of Wall Street andthe corporations it funded. In his 1994 book, Battling Wall Street: The KennedyPresidency, University of Pittsburgh professor Donald Gibson, who spent nearlyforty years researching economic and political power in the United States, madea cogent argument that the primary motive behind the JFK assassination was thathe was at loggerheads with the Wall Street Establishment, those same globalistfinanciers who first promoted communism in 1917 Russia and then nationalsocialism, the Nazis, in Germany.After detailing attacks on Kennedy’s economic policies, beginning with hissuccess in forcing the major steel manufacturers to reverse a price increase in1962, Gibson stated, “The Establishment rejection of Kennedy became increasinglyintense during his time in office.” Gibson wrote that two prominent businesspublications—Fortune and the Wall Street Journal—were the most hostile criticsof Kennedy and his economic policies and both “were related in numerous ways tothe two most influential financial groups in the United States—Morgan andRockefeller.” He also noted, “By the early 1960s, the Council on ForeignRelations, Morgan and Rockefeller interests, and the intelligence community wereso extensively inbred as to be virtually a single entity.”Other researchers also have revealed the closeness between the Wall StreetEstablishment and US intelligence, particularly the CIA. They are virtually twosides of the same coin.As evidenced by the affair of Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko and the on-again,off-again anti-Castro Mongoose program, there appear to have been seriousdivisions within the CIA in the early 1960s. While some factions undoubtedlysupported President Kennedy and his programs, others did not disguise theirhatred of him.The CIA had become highly compartmentalized. Often CIA employees working on oneproject would have no idea that people they came into contact with also wereworking for the agency. And for expediency, the agency employed and used somevery unsavory characters—such as David Ferrie.There can be little doubt that Oswald and many persons in contact with him wereconnected to the CIA. These contacts, plus the abundant evidence that Oswald wasinvolved in intelligence work, point to who was maneuvering Oswald in the fallof 1963. Some individuals within the CIA may have played roles in anassassination conspiracy that later compelled their superiors to cover up theiractivities for fear that their connection to the agency might become public.However, it seems highly unlikely that as an organization, the CIA initiated theKennedy assassination. But senior corporate and intelligence officials were notoverly concerned if something were to happen to the young president. Suchofficials traditionally have sought out politicians who would look out for theirinterests in Washington. So in the days of Kennedy’s Camelot, intelligencechiefs along with oil and business titans may have looked to a man they knewthey could deal with, if not completely trust—vice president Lyndon B. Johnson.All the Way with LBJ [Contents.html#rsec59]In Dallas on the day Kennedy died some people were iconoclastic enough tosuggest that Vice President Johnson was behind the assassination. These weremostly longtime Texas residents who had heard vicious stories about Johnson foryears and who knew the Texas politician had more to gain from Kennedy’s deaththan just about anyone. Even today, many serious students of the assassinationcannot discount the idea that Johnson in some way played a role in the Dallastragedy. In fact, in recent years, a spate of books led by Barr McClellan’s 2002Blood, Money & Power have actually accused Johnson of masterminding theassassination. However, none have offered irrefutable evidence to support thatcharge. McClellan, whose son Scott was among George W. Bush’s White House presssecretaries, had worked for the Austin law offices of Clark, Thomas, Harris,Denius and Winters, a firm closely associated with Lyndon Johnson.Johnson’s actions following the assassination do little to stop suchspeculation. And a close study of the corruption and murder that doggedJohnson’s political career only adds to the suspicion.Lyndon Baines Johnson was born August 27, 1908, near Johnson City, Texas, whichhad been named for his grandfather, one of the area’s original settlers. Hisfather, Sam Ealy Johnson, who served in the Texas Legislature for twelve years,told neighbors, “A US senator is born today.”Young Johnson graduated from Johnson City High School as president of his seniorclass of six. After running away to California, he hitchhiked back home andenrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos.After graduating at age twenty-two, Johnson got a teaching job in Houston, butit failed to hold the interest of this ambitious young man. So in 1931, Johnsonwas drawn into Texas politics, campaigning strenuously for conservativecongressman Richard M. Kleberg. After Kleberg’s victory, Johnson accompanied himto Washington as his secretary.In 1934 Johnson was visiting in Austin when he met an attractivetwenty-one-year-old journalism student named Claudia Alta Taylor, the daughterof an affluent merchant and landowner in Karnack, Texas. As the story goes, ablack “mammy” took one look at the infant Claudia and declared, “Lawd, she’s aspretty as a lady bird,” and from then on, she was known as “Lady Bird.” After awhirlwind courtship of two months, consisting mainly of daily telephone callsfrom Washington, Johnson returned to Texas and asked “Bird” to marry him. Sheagreed and the couple drove to San Antonio for a rushed wedding in St. Mark’sEpiscopal Church. After a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the Johnsons moved toWashington, where they rented a one-bedroom apartment and Johnson resumed hispolitical work for Kleberg.Watching the energetic Johnson was a close friend of the Johnson family,congressman Sam Rayburn, already a power on Capitol Hill. In August 1935, thanksto some help from Rayburn, president Franklin Roosevelt named Johnson as Texasdirector of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal program for employingyoungsters.Capitalizing on his authority to award loans and jobs, Johnson created aformidable political base in south Texas. He also used his new position toingratiate himself with President Roosevelt, whom Johnson referred to as “mypolitical daddy.” By now his career designs were set firmly in politics.In early 1937, with the sudden death of Austin congressman James P. Buchanan,Johnson saw an opportunity to advance. At the same time Johnson was looking forfinancial and political support to make a bid for Buchanan’s seat, Austinattorney Alvin Wirtz and his client Herman Brown were looking for help inWashington.Brown’s construction company, Brown & Root, had already spent millions buildingthe Marshall Ford Dam in south Texas. But the project had not been officiallyauthorized by Congress; rather it had begun as a government grant obtained byBuchanan. With his death, the entire $10 million project was in limbo.Backed by Wirtz, Brown, and their well-heeled business associates, theindefatigable Johnson raced through nearly 8,000 square miles of Texas hillcountry pledging total support of Roosevelt and his New Deal, a theme that satwell with impoverished farmers and laborers.The senatorial election, climaxing with a raging blizzard and sudden surgery forLBJ to repair a ruptured appendix, was a victory, with Johnson outpolling fiveopponents by 3,000 votes.Back in Washington, the twenty-nine-year-old Johnson managed to getauthorization for the dam project as well as a contract for Brown & Root tobuild a huge Navy base at Corpus Christi.Herman Brown and his friends were so pleased with Johnson’s performance that in1940 the young congressman was offered a share in very lucrative oil propertieswith no money down. Johnson was told he could pay for his share out of yearlyprofits. It was tantamount to a gift. Brown was shocked when Johnson, who hadbeen complaining of lack of money, turned him down, saying the offer “would killme politically.” Since both a House and a Senate seat would come from Texas’sreliable oil and gas constituency, Brown realized even at that time thatJohnson’s true political goal was the presidency.As a congressman, Johnson continued to perform for his oil and business mentorsback in Texas. In 1941, Brown & Root obtained a lucrative Navy contract to buildfour sub chasers, although as George Brown later recalled, “We didn’t know thestern from the aft—I mean the bow—of the boat.”Just two days after Pearl Harbor, Johnson—who had been commissioned as alieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve some months previously—was called toactive duty, becoming the first congressman to leave for military service. Afterserving less than a year, Johnson arrived back in Washington after Rooseveltcalled on all congressmen serving in the armed forces to return home.His wartime service had won Johnson at least one solid ally. After a period ofcool relations due to Johnson’s blatant ambitiousness, he again was accepted bypowerful House Speaker Sam Rayburn. Rayburn taught Johnson his politicalphilosophy, which he repeated often: “To get along, you have to go along.”J. Evetts Haley, a biographer critical of Johnson, wrote, “Lyndon becameRayburn’s protégé; their relationship a fusion of experience and politicalsagacity with youthful ardor and enthusiasm, with no appreciable enhancement ofthe ideals and ethics of either.”Johnson entered a race for the Senate in 1948. It was a close race betweenJohnson, still identified with Roosevelt and the New Deal, and conservativeTexas governor Coke Stevenson, who managed to defeat Johnson in the Democraticprimary. However, Stevenson didn’t have a clear majority, so a run-off electionwas called for August 28.Due to slow communications and manual voting procedures, the election outcomewas in doubt for several days. Finally on September 2, Johnson went on the radiowith a “victory speech,” which shocked the confident Stevenson forces. VeteranTexas newsman Clyde Wantland wrote:Their fears were validated the following day . . . when a source friendly toStevenson reported from Jim Wells County that Precinct 13 had been recanvassedand a “correction” made favoring Johnson with 202 more votes. Johnson’s radiobroadcast on Thursday thus became a reality on Saturday.This revision earned Johnson the sobriquet of “Landslide Lyndon” and began oneof the longest legal feuds in Texas history.Johnson’s opponents claimed the eighty-seven-vote “correction.” Thiseighty-seven-vote edge in the 1948 election came only after frantic phone callsbetween Johnson and George Parr, a powerful south Texas political boss known asthe “Duke of Duval County.”The controversy continued into 1977, when Luis Salas, the local election judge,admitted to the Dallas Morning News that he had certified fictitious ballots forJohnson on orders from Parr, who committed suicide in 1975. Salas told newsreporters, “Johnson did not win that election; it was stolen for him.” But moretroubling than this case of common political fraud was the series of deaths andfederal government interference with investigations into Johnson’s activities.One of these deaths was Bill Mason, a south Texas newsman investigating theDuval incident, who was murdered by Sam Smithwick, a Parr associate who in turnwas found hanged in his prison cell after saying he was willing to talk.As far back as 1941, the IRS had initiated investigations of Johnson’s finances,but had been blocked by orders from Johnson’s mentor, President Roosevelt. In1954, the Austin district IRS collector, Frank L. Scofield, was removed fromoffice accused of forcing political contributions from his employees. Scofieldwas acquitted of these charges, but in his absence, all of the IRS filesrelating to Johnson and Brown & Root were placed in a Quonset hut in southAustin that mysteriously caught fire, destroying the evidence.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, both Johnson and his protégé John Connallyhad offices in Fort Worth. Johnson operated out of the Hotel Texas, the site ofKennedy’s breakfast speech the morning of November 22, 1963. Connally’s officeswere in the historic Flatiron Building, which later became the Press Club ofFort Worth.It was in Fort Worth that both Johnson and Connally came into contact withgamblers, who in turn were later connected to Jack Ruby as well as anti-KennedyTexas oilmen.W. C. Kirkwood was known as a “gentleman gambler” because he never allowedanyone in his high-stakes poker games who was on a salary. He did not want to bethe cause of someone’s children going hungry. Kirkwood conducted his big-timegambling at a luxurious, sprawling Spanish-style complex known as the FourDeuces—the street address was 2222 on Fort Worth’s Jacksboro Highway, oncenotorious for its taverns and prostitution. It was here, under the protectiveeye of off-duty policemen, that such men as H. L. Hunt and Clint Murchinsonjoined Sam Rayburn and his protégé Johnson for hours of Kirkwood-providedhospitality.Retired Fort Worth policeman Paul Bewley recalled for this author that whileproviding security for Johnson’s Hotel Texas office suite, the one man who hadunquestioned access to Johnson was W. C. Kirkwood.Assassination researchers noted that Kirkwood’s son, Pat Kirkwood, hostedKennedy’s Secret Service guards in his Cellar club the night before his trip toDallas—and that both the Kirkwoods and Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby shared acommon close friend in gambler Lewis J. McWillie. McWillie—who at one timeoperated his own gambling establishment in Dallas, the Top of the Hill Club—hadtried to open a casino in Cuba in 1959 and had participated in gunrunningschemes.There may have even been some connection between Ruby and Texas governor JohnConnally only days before the assassination. Diane Bishop was nineteen years oldand working at the message and reservation desk in the Sheraton Hotel in Houstonon Wednesday night, November 20, 1963. Connally had taken a room there inpreparation for meeting Kennedy the next day but the staff was under orders notto make his presence public. That night, Bishop, who said she wasn’t even awarethat Connally was governor, received a call from a man who had to speak up dueto background noise “like an airport or public place.” The man sounded like themessage was urgent and asked to speak with Connally. As per orders, Bishop saidno one with that name was registered there but the man asked to leave a message.The caller told her, “Tell Connally, if I don’t see you tonight in Houston, I’llsee you in Dallas. This is Jack Ruby.”Bishop thought no more of the call but filed the message away. She was shockedon November 24 to hear that Oswald had been shot by a Jack Ruby. On Monday,November 25, she went to work intending to retrieve the phone message but foundthe hotel “swarming” with federal agents. Although Bishop was questionedregarding the phone call, her written note, the only proof of the incident, wasmissing.Yet, despite links between Jack Ruby’s friend McWillie, the Kirkwoods, Texasoilmen, Lyndon Johnson, and John Connally, apparently neither the WarrenCommission nor the House Select Committee on Assassinations felt the need tofully investigate these associations.In 1951, Johnson was elected Democratic whip in the Senate. Two years later, atonly forty-four years of age, Johnson became the Senate’s majority leader.Johnson used his powerful position to best advantage, according to biographerRobert Caro, who told the Atlantic Monthly:For years, men came into Lyndon Johnson’s office and handed him envelopesstuffed with cash. They didn’t stop coming even when the office in which he satwas the office of the vice president of the United States. Fifty thousanddollars in hundred-dollar bills in sealed envelopes was what one lobbyist forone oil company testified he brought to Johnson’s office during his term as vicepresident.There is evidence that Johnson also profited from cash contributions from themob. Jack Halfen—a former associate of Bonnie and Clyde, Frank Costello, VitoGenovese, and Carlos Marcello—was the mob’s gambling coordinator in Houston. Ontrial for income tax evasion in 1954, Halfen revealed how Houston gamblingnetted almost $15 million a year with 40 percent going to Marcello, 35 percentto Halfen, and 25 percent to Texas police officials and politicians.In talks with federal officials while serving a prison term, Halfen told howJohnson had received more than $500,000 in contributions over a ten-year periodwhile in the Senate. He said Johnson in turn had helped the crime syndicate bykilling anti-racketeering legislation, watering down bills that could not bedefeated, and slowing congressional probes into organized crime.Halfen substantiated his close ties to Johnson with photographs of himself andJohnson on a private hunting trip and a letter from Johnson to the Texas Boardof Paroles written on Halfen’s behalf.According to published reports, Johnson also received large-scale payoffs fromTeamster president Jimmy Hoffa. A former senatorial aide, Jack Sullivan,testified that he witnessed the transfer of a suitcase full of money from aTeamster lobbyist through a Maryland senator to Johnson’s chief aide, CliffCarter.Also recall that one of Johnson’s “trusted friends,” Bobby Baker, had long anddocumented mob connections. Baker once wrote, “A New Orleans businessman rumoredto be well connected with the Mafia had once sought me out to inquire whetherPresident Lyndon Johnson might be willing to pardon Hoffa in exchange for onemillion dollars.”The Johnson administration’s anticrime record is dismal. Racket-busting came toa virtual halt. During the first four years following the assassination, JusticeDepartment organized-crime section field time had dropped by 48 percent, timebefore grand juries by 72 percent, and the number of district court briefs filedby that section by 83 percent.There also was a discernible lack of prosecution follow-up to corruption chargesagainst Lyndon B. Johnson, such as the controversial awarding of a $7 billioncontract for the TFX prototype fighter-bomber plane to Texas-based GeneralDynamics. LBJ’s close friend Fred Korth became secretary of the Navy when JohnConnally resigned to become Texas governor and was negotiating this TFXcontract.On October 7, 1963, Baker was forced to leave his post as LBJ’s man in theSenate. This was soon followed by the resignation of Korth.Yet another example of Johnson’s willingness to circumvent the law for hiscareer’s sake came in 1960, when he decided to run for president despitecontinually denying this decision. At Johnson’s urging, Democratic Partylegislators in Texas rushed through a law that superseded an old statuteforbidding a candidate from seeking two offices at the same time.Thus, Texas voters witnessed the bizarre spectacle of Johnson running for vicepresident on Kennedy’s liberal national ticket while also running for Texassenator on the state’s conservative Democratic ticket.One can easily imagine Johnson’s anger and hurt when the Democratic Party in1960 handed its presidential nomination not to this longtime standard bearer,but instead to John F. Kennedy, a relative newcomer. Johnson complained tofriends, “Jack was out kissing babies while I was passing bills.”Knowing how Kennedy’s top supporters detested him, Johnson must have seenKennedy’s nomination as a major roadblock in his drive for the presidency. Hewas therefore pleasantly surprised when Kennedy offered him the vice president’sposition on the ballot. This offer, coming as it did after an often-bittercontest between the two men, has been the subject of much debate. It now seemsclear that Kennedy never really believed that Johnson would swap his Senatepower for the empty honor of being vice president. He made the offer due topressure from J. Edgar Hoover and as a conciliatory move, fully expectingJohnson to turn it down. But Johnson saw it as an opportunity to get one stepcloser to the presidency and promptly accepted. Reminded by friends that theoffice of vice president carried little importance, Johnson said, “Power iswhere power goes.”The Kennedy forces were shocked. How could Kennedy pick Johnson, who stood foralmost everything they hated? It has been speculated that Kennedy acceptedJohnson because it seemed necessary to have Johnson’s help in swinging the 1960election in southern and western states.This proved prophetic. It was only through Johnson’s tireless efforts that sixcrucial southern states—including Texas—were kept in the Democratic column.In Texas this was accomplished very simply. According to biographer Haley, bothJohnson and Rayburn warned the state’s oilmen that if they voted for Nixon andthe Democrats won, the oilmen could kiss the oil depletion allowance goodbye. Sooil money helped swing the state for Kennedy-Johnson, despite a nationalDemocratic Party platform that called for repealing the allowance—mute testimonyto their belief in Johnson’s power and hypocrisy. As vice president, Johnson wasa changed man. Gone were his power and enthusiasm. There was almost constantfriction between this old-style political powerbroker and the new breed ofKennedy men. Johnson’s brother, Sam Houston Johnson, wrote about the treatmentof his brother as vice president:They made his stay in the vice presidency the most miserable three years of hislife. He wasn’t the number two man in the administration; he was the lowest manon the totem pole. . . . I know him well enough to know he felt humiliated timeand time again, that he was openly snubbed by second-echelon White Housestaffers who snickered at him behind his back and called him “Uncle Corn Pone.”By the fall of 1963, rumors were rife that Johnson would be dumped from the 1964Democratic national ticket. In fact, the day of Kennedy’s assassination, theDallas Morning News carried the headline: NIXON PREDICTS JFK MAY DROP JOHNSON.Consequently, Johnson made several trips abroad, most probably to escape thedaily humiliations in the White House.James Wagenvoord, editorial business manager and assistant to the executiveeditor of Life magazine, has revealed that his magazine was compilinginformation on Johnson’s corrupt practices. “Beginning in later summer 1963 themagazine, based upon information fed from Bobby Kennedy and the JusticeDepartment, had been developing a major news break piece concerning Johnson andBobby Baker,” said Wagenvoord. “On publication Johnson would have been finishedand off the 1964 ticket (the reason the material was fed to us) and wouldprobably have been facing prison time. At the time Life magazine was arguablythe most important general news source in the US. The top management of TimeInc. was closely allied with the USA’s various intelligence agencies and we wereused by the Kennedy Justice Department as a conduit to the public.” Immediatelyfollowing the assassination, the exposé on Johnson was shredded and never sawpublication.Soon, yet another investigation into Johnson’s dealings got under way. This timeit involved a big-time Texas wheeler-dealer named Billie Sol Estes. HenryMarshall, a Department of Agriculture official, was looking into Estes’s habitof acquiring millions in federal cotton allotment payments on land that wasunder water or actually owned by the government. Marshall was particularlyinterested in Estes’s connections with his longtime friend Lyndon Johnson.However, before any official action could be taken, Marshall was found dead in aremote section of his farm near Franklin, Texas. He had been shot five times inthe abdomen. Nearby lay a bolt-action single-shot .22-caliber rifle.Five days later, without the benefit of an autopsy, a local peace justice ruledMarshall’s death a suicide. Others knew better. Veteran Texas Ranger ClintPeoples once told this author, “If Henry Marshall committed suicide, I can ridea jackass to the moon.”In 1985 Estes, after being granted immunity from prosecution, told Texas mediathat Johnson had ordered Marshall’s death to prevent his connections with Estesfrom being exposed. Later that year, a Texas district judge changed the officialverdict of Marshall’s death from suicide to homicide. At least three other menconnected with the Estes case died in unusual circumstances.By the time of the Kennedy assassination, dead witnesses, missing evidence, andinterference with official investigations were nothing new to Lyndon Johnson.It may also be highly significant that during Johnson’s rise to power inWashington, one of his closest friends—in fact, a neighbor who frequently washis dinner guest—was none other than FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, also nostranger to the manipulation of politically sensitive investigations.After becoming president, Johnson was encouraged to retire the crusty Hoover.But Johnson—possibly aware of the damaging evidence Hoover could provide againsthim—declined, saying, “I’d rather have him inside the tent pissing out, thanoutside pissing in.”Although it was against established security practice for the president and thevice president to be together in public, Johnson was riding only two cars behindKennedy in the fateful Dallas motorcade.At Parkland Hospital, Johnson was informed of Kennedy’s death and then urged byKennedy’s assistant press secretary Malcolm Kilduff to make a public statement.As reported by author Jack Bell, Johnson told Kilduff:No, Mac. . . . I think I had better get out of here and get back to the planebefore you announce [Kennedy’s death]. We don’t know whether there is aworldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were afterPresident Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker McCormack or SenatorHayden. We just don’t know.It is significant to note that although Johnson mentioned fears of a “worldwideconspiracy” loudly in the hours immediately after Kennedy’s death, there appearsto have been no significant action to counter such a threat. While the Texasborder was closed for a couple of hours, there was no widespread closing of USborders and major airplane and ship terminals were not shut down. Furthermore,while some units were placed on stepped-up status, there was no full-scalemilitary alert, despite the commander in chief’s stated concern.Most significantly, at the same time Johnson was loudly decrying “a worldwideconspiracy,” Warrant Officer Ira D. Gearhart, codenamed “Bagman” or “Football,”who carried the launch codes for nuclear missiles in the event of sudden attack,was left behind not once but twice. He and Johnson became separated in the maddash to Parkland and even then the Secret Service would not allow him in theroom with Johnson at the hospital. In the rush to return to Love Field, Gearhartwas left behind at Parkland and had to force his way onto a policeman’s lap inan attempt to keep up with Johnson. Apparently Johnson had no real concern overhostilities with foreign powers.It has seemed strange to researchers that while Kennedy’s men wanted to leaveDallas as quickly as possible, it was Johnson who demanded that the entourageremain at Love Field until he could be sworn in as president by federal judgeSarah T. Hughes.Hubert Humphrey, who later became Johnson’s vice president, once correctlystated, “A vice president becomes president when there is no president. Later,when he takes the oath, he puts on the cloak of office. But that act is purelysymbolic.”After arriving back in Washington, Jackie Kennedy explained to Robert Kennedythat the delay in returning was due to Johnson, who told her the attorneygeneral had told him to take the oath of office in Dallas. Robert Kennedy wassurprised and replied that he had made no such suggestion. Johnson compoundedthis lie months later in his deposition to the Warren Commission, when he againstated that it was Attorney General Kennedy who had urged him to take the oathimmediately.The new president was waiting on board presidential jet Air Force One whenKennedy’s body reached Love Field. In his Warren Commission affidavit, Johnsonsaid Kennedy’s aide Kenneth O’Donnell specifically told him to take thepresidential plane because it had better communication equipment. However,O’Donnell denied this, telling author William Manchester, “The President and Ihad no conversation regarding Air Force One. If we had known that he was goingon Air Force One, we would have taken Air Force Two. One plane was just like theother.”O’Donnell later wrote that a Warren Commission attorney asked him to “change histestimony so that it would agree with the President’s”—an offer O’Donnelldeclined.While others were shocked into immobility by Kennedy’s death, Johnson exhibiteda strange—and perhaps suspicious—ability to press forward with his work. Johnsonaide George Reedy commented that while “everything was chaotic, only thePresident knew what he was doing.” While Kennedy’s body still lay in state inthe White House East Room, Johnson spoke with John Kenneth Galbraith, a liberalHarvard economist and confidant of Kennedy. Johnson laid out his 1964 electionstrategy to the flabbergasted Galbraith, saying, “I want to come down very hardon civil rights, not because Kennedy was for it, but because I am for it.”Author Jack Bell noted, “Almost from the moment he took the Presidential oath,Johnson had been unfolding a master plan designed to win the Presidency in hisown right and . . . to carve for himself a favorable place in history.”During the course of the assassination investigation, a number of incidentsoccurred involving Johnson that suspicious researchers have viewed asdestruction of critical evidence.Within seventy-two hours of Kennedy’s death—at Johnson’s order—the presidentiallimousine SX-100, which carried Kennedy through Dallas, was shipped to Detroit,where the body was replaced and the interior completely refurbished. In anyother case, this would have been destruction of evidence, since bullet marks onthe windshield and blood traces could have provided essential clues as to thenumber and direction of shots.After the assassination, Governor Connally’s clothing—also vital evidence—wastaken from the office of congressman Henry Gonzalez by Secret Service agentssent by Johnson aide Cliff Carter. Connally’s clothing had been cleaned andpressed by the time it was handed over to the Warren Commission and, hence,useless as evidence.One of Johnson’s actions that caused researchers of the assassination no end ofproblems was Executive Order 11652, which locked an immense amount ofassassination evidence and documents in the National Archives away from theAmerican public until the year 2039. It was this act, more than any other, thathas caused so much speculation about Johnson’s possible role in theassassination. However, by the twenty-first century, thanks primarily to thecreation of the Assassinations Records Review Board, much of this material hadbecome public, though in 2013 there continued to be conflicts with the NationalArchives over the release of JFK assassination documents.It is now publicly known that Johnson’s mental state deteriorated significantlyin the years following his predecessor’s assassination. Former aide andspeechwriter Richard Goodwin, who had helped fashion LBJ’s “Great Society,” haswritten that Johnson became obsessed with the idea that America was being takenover by his enemies—communists and “those Kennedys.” Goodwin said he and aideBill Moyers even consulted psychiatrists about his boss’s behavior.Another episode that may have had underlying psychological significance wasrelated by Johnson’s younger brother. Sam Houston Johnson said a few days afterthe assassination he got a long-distance call from the new president, who toldhim, “I’ve been waiting for the chance to talk to you and let you know how muchI appreciated all you’ve done for me, Sam Houston.” Sam, who said he had had afew drinks, jokingly replied, “I had nothing to do with Oswald.” Lyndon flew offthe handle, shouting into the phone, “Goddamit, Sam, what kind of remark isthat?” Lyndon, widely known for his coarse humor, astonished his brother bylaunching into a thirty-minute tirade, getting angrier and angrier by themoment.Madeleine Duncan Brown, whose claim to have been Johnson’s mistress for twentyyears has never been successfully refuted, publicly stated that Johnson hadforeknowledge of the assassination. In her 1997 book, Texas in the Morning,Brown told of meeting with Johnson in Austin’s Driskill Hotel at the end ofDecember 1963. When she told him some people were accusing Johnson of playingsome role in the assassination, he told her, “It was Texas oil and those fuckingrenegade intelligence bastards in Washington.”But did Johnson really have enough power to initiate the assassination and toforce literally dozens of government officials and agents to lie and cover upthat fact? Probably not.However, if Johnson played some role in an assassination plot, he would havetaken great pains to distance himself from such a conspiracy. Evidence of such arole would certainly not be readily available. Therefore, today it is possibleonly to point out that Johnson—above everyone else—benefited most from Kennedy’sdeath. Plus, it only stands to reason that no one would kill the chief executivewithout some assurance that his successor would not move heaven and earth topursue and punish the perpetrators.With the assassination, Johnson achieved his lifelong goal of gaining thepresidency, his business and oil backers were rid of Kennedy’s interference, andhis supporters who wanted an Asian war—notably Brown & Root and ranking officersat the Pentagon—were free to pursue a widening conflict.A final point is that Johnson—always conscious of his role in history—must havefeared appearing to be a dunce by continuing to support the Warren Commission’slone-assassin myth. In an interview with Walter Cronkite in the early 1970s,Johnson expressed the belief that the assassination involved more than oneperson, then asked network executives to delete his remarks from thebroadcast—which they did.In 1973, Johnson was quoted in Atlantic Monthly acknowledging, “I never believedthat Oswald acted alone although I can accept that he pulled the trigger.”Johnson even voiced the suspicion that the CIA had a hand in the assassination,according to an FBI document released in 1977. The document quotes Johnson’spostmaster general and close friend Marvin Watson as relaying to the bureau that“[Johnson] was now convinced there was a plot in connection with theassassination. Watson stated the President felt the CIA had something to do withthis plot.”Yet this, too, was kept hidden from the public for years and is still not widelyknown.Was Johnson well aware of such a plot and mentioned it in later years only sothat future historians would not classify him as dense and naïve?While this ambitiously driven man from Texas most probably did not initiate adeath plot against Kennedy, everything known about the man—from the deaths andcover-ups of Texas scandals to his continued prosecution of the unpopularVietnam War—indicates that Johnson may have had the willingness to join in aconspiracy that would place him in the White House.As commander in chief of the armed forces and close confidant to the powerful J.Edgar Hoover, Johnson certainly had the ability to subvert a meaningfulinvestigation into Kennedy’s death—and a wealth of evidence suggests just suchsubversion. Did Johnson and Hoover contract with the mob to kill Kennedy? Or didthe mob approach them? Or did they simply turn a blind eye to an existing plot?The truth of their involvement may not be proven for years, if ever. However, aconspiracy involving Lyndon Johnson and his buddy Hoover as an alternative tothe Warren Commission’s discredited lone-assassin theory goes farther in tyingtogether the disparate bits of assassination evidence than any theory offered todate, and cannot be summarily dismissed.Due to the demonstrable actions of both Johnson and Hoover in suppressing,altering, and fabricating evidence in this case, both men are clearlyaccessories after the fact. Under our legal system, accessories in murder casesare considered just as guilty as the person who pulled the trigger.History will surely hold president and commander in chief Lyndon Johnson, alongwith his friend FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, guilty in the assassination—if notfor orchestrating the assassination itself, at least for taking actions duringtheir time in office to block any meaningful investigation into the plot."},{"pageContent":"Soldiers [Contents.html#rch10]During the past two hundred years the military forces of the United States haveaccumulated a distinguished history. From the Revolution-era citizen who couldbecome a fighting man ready to protect his community in a minute to theprofessional Marines who grimly stand guard in the face of terrorism at USembassies around the world, the American soldier has proven his worth time andagain. Amid the bitter dissension produced by US policy in Southeast Asia andcurrently the Middle East, few people seriously question the ability or braveryof the individual GI.However, throughout world history, it has proven extremely difficult to returnto civilian control of government in peacetime once power has been invested inthe military. From the takeover of the Roman Empire by the Praetorian Guard upuntil today, military leaders have sought to maintain power and control.This situation was aggravated in the United States during World War II by acombining of military and industrial power.The Military-Industrial Complex [Contents.html#rsec60]On January 17, 1961, three days before John F. Kennedy took office as president,president Dwight Eisenhower gave his farewell address to Congress. In this talkhe coined the phrase “military-industrial complex” and warned against potentialabuses by such an entity. He said:This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industryis new in the American experience. The total influence—economical, political,even spiritual—is felt in every city, every state house, every office of thefederal government. . . . In the councils of government, we must guard againstthe acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by themilitary-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplacedpower exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combinationendanger our liberties or democratic processes.Eisenhower’s warning was especially timely, as the role of themilitary-industrial complex in American life has continued to grow undersuccessive presidencies. By 2013, many police officers were wearing blackbulletproof vests and Nazi-style helmets while remote-controlled drone aircraftprowled American skies.The rise of the military-industrial complex can be charted by annual militarybudget expenditures. In 1950 the military budget was $13 billion; by 1961 thishad risen to $47 billion; and by the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, it was $100billion. By 1986 annual expenses by the Department of Defense had risen tonearly $170 billion. In 2012 this figure was up to $707.5 billion. By adding inthe budgets of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and FBIcounterterrorism, total expenditures for national security came to an astounding$1.4 trillion.A large part of the argument for maintaining an ongoing war economy came frommen and women who lived through the shock of Pearl Harbor. Vowing never again toallow the United States to be caught unaware by an enemy—although substantialevidence now shows that the Japanese attack was not wholly unexpected in certainWashington circles—such persons have argued that assembly and production linesmust be kept operating so that America can convert to war production quickly, ifneeded. This argument—plus the fact that millions of American jobs depend ondefense contracts—has been instrumental in maintaining the war economy.Critics, on the other hand, claim the permanent war economy has actually been adrain on America’s economic life—with its production of non-usable goods and itspenchant for inefficiency and corruption.[images/line.jpg]A product of his time, senator John F. Kennedy parroted the Pentagon line duringthe 1960 campaign, promising increases in military spending.Once in the Oval Office—with access to other sources of information—Kennedychanged his attitudes toward the military. Earlier he had echoed Pentagonfigures showing that the Soviet Union possessed between five hundred and onethousand intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to later reports, thenumber was more like fifty. Kennedy complained that he had been ill-informed asto the actual number of missiles and suggested that this exaggeration was partof Pentagon strategy.This complaint has been repeated over and over through the years, even by formerCIA director William Colby in comments on the cover of the book The Myth ofSoviet Military Supremacy, which he called “the greatest intelligence gap ofall: the exaggeration of Soviet power in comparison with America’s, which fuelsthe wasteful and dangerous nuclear arms race.”In addition to worries over the military, Kennedy also became concerned with the$3 billion federal deficit of his time—a paltry sum compared to today’s nearly$16 trillion—and feared it would present a threat to the US dollar. Accordingly,Kennedy named a Ford Motor Company executive, Robert McNamara, as his secretaryof defense and changes began to take place. On March 28, 1961, Kennedy toldCongress, “In January, while ordering certain immediately needed changes, Iinstructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy,capacity, commitments, and needs in light of present and future dangers.”Kennedy began to significantly modify the way defense and intelligence operated.Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had depended greatly on the National SecurityCouncil (NSC), a creation of the National Security Act of 1947. In 1963 the NSCconsisted of the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary ofdefense, and director of the Office of Emergency Planning.Theoretically, the CIA was to be controlled by the NSC. But Kennedy had anotherway of getting things done. Accustomed to the quick-acting, hard-hitting worldof political campaigning, Kennedy neglected the NSC method. Instead, he wouldcall upon his friends and family to get things done. While this may have beeneffective at the time, it left both the Pentagon and the CIA largely to theirown devices—a circumstance Kennedy came to regret.During this same period, US foreign policy was being greatly influenced by a newvision of the role of the military in the world. This vision was codified in aMay 15, 1959, document written by General Richard Stilwell as a member of aspecial presidential committee. Innocuously titled “Training Under the MutualTraining Program,” this document offered nothing less than a plan to protect thenoncommunist world by having nations ruled by a military elite with training andideology supplied by Americans.Initially Kennedy was fascinated by this concept, since by nature he was astrong believer in negotiation and limited response rather than simply usingmilitary options. Words such as “counterinsurgency,” “pacification,” and“special forces” began to creep into our political language.Following the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion, a special board of inquiry wasconvened to dissect what went wrong. It was here that both John and RobertKennedy began to learn what the new military doctrines of counterinsurgency,flexible response, civic action, and nation building really meant. They saw howthe obsession with secrecy had completely changed the way the military andintelligence operated. Everything was on a “need-to-know” basis, with fewer andfewer responsible leaders included on the “need-to-know” lists. After the Bay ofPigs inquiry Kennedy became convinced that the CIA and the Pentagon had misledhim terribly, and from that point on he was highly skeptical of information fromthose sources. Moreover, the inquiry showed the Kennedy brothers how powerfulthe military-industrial complex and its intelligence-security force had become.Kennedy did learn something from this coalition—how to concoct a “cover story,”which may account for his public support of the CIA while his private commentsand actions showed otherwise.Kennedy began to balk at his military advisers, who had assured him of victoryin Cuba, and who now were urging military intervention, to include the use ofnuclear weapons, in Laos, where communist insurgents were gaining ground.Military hawks became incensed when Kennedy negotiated with Soviet PremierNikita Khrushchev a coalition government in Laos, forestalling armed conflict.They were further angered when Kennedy told them he would not send combat troopsto South Vietnam.The blending of the military and the political was seen most clearly in Vietnam,where it was the US ambassador who was in charge, not the senior militarycommanders.War should be politicians’ last resort. But once war is inevitable, it should befought by professional soldiers with clearly defined goals and objectives.After the CIA-sponsored Bay of Pigs fiasco Kennedy began to see that thisnation’s paramilitary and undercover operations were getting out of hand. Heattempted to stem this trend by issuing two National Security Action Memoranda(NSAM) in June 1961. NSAM 55, signed personally by Kennedy, basically statedthat he would hold the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff personallyresponsible for all activity of a military nature during peacetime, the same asduring wartime. In other words, Kennedy wanted all cloak-and-dagger operationsas well as military expeditions under the control, or at least under thescrutiny, of the chairman—and hence under his control.NSAM 57 attempted to divide paramilitary activity between the military and theCIA. Basically, this document stipulated that the CIA would be allowed onlysmall covert operations, while any large operations must be studied and approvedby the military. It seemed a reasonable division of responsibility. However,there were men in both the CIA and the Pentagon who did not appreciate thisattempt to curb their power and prerogatives.Not only did Kennedy attempt to curtail the power of both the military andintelligence, but he also presented a very different worldview from the past. OnNovember 16, 1961, Kennedy told a Seattle audience, “We must face the fact thatthe United States is neither omnipotent nor omniscient—that we cannot impose ourwill upon the other 94 percent of mankind—that we cannot right every wrong orreverse every adversity—and that therefore there cannot be an American solutionto every world problem.”With his words and actions, Kennedy became the first US president since WorldWar II to address the myth of America’s infallibility. This did not sit wellwith the military-industrial complex, which had so much to gain—includingprofits—by controlling the raw resources of other nations.In the midst of Kennedy’s reappraisal of US military and intelligence operationscame the Cuban Missile Crisis.In October 1962, information from satellites and U-2 flights revealed that theSoviets were preparing offensive missile bases in Cuba, only ninety miles fromthe United States. The military and the CIA were aghast. They prescribed nothingless than immediate bombing of the missile sites and another invasion of theisland.Kennedy chose a different approach. He personally struck a deal with PremierKhrushchev—the Russians would remove their missiles from Cuba and in return theUnited States would remove its offensive missiles from Turkey and Kennedy wouldpledge not to support a new invasion of Cuba. The Soviets appeared to back downand Kennedy’s popularity rose significantly, except in offices at the Pentagonand at Langley, Virginia.Meanwhile, the Kennedy administration continued its efforts to reduce militaryspending. On March 30, 1963, McNamara announced a reorganization program thatwould have closed fifty-two military installations in twenty-five states, aswell as twenty-one overseas bases, over a three-year period.Then on August 5, 1963, following lengthy negotiations, the United States, GreatBritain, and the Soviet Union signed a limited nuclear test–ban treatyforbidding the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.As part of this “first step” toward what later would be termed “détente,”Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to install a “hot line” telephone system betweenWashington and Moscow.It was a serious deviation from the hard Cold War policies of the past, andmilitary leaders—both retired and active—did not hesitate to voice theirdisapproval.But for all his activities to reduce the risk of war and curtail the militaryand intelligence establishments, Kennedy’s most momentous—and perhapsfatal—decisions came when he began to reevaluate US policy in Southeast Asia.Kennedy and Vietnam [Contents.html#rsec61]From the moment Lyndon B. Johnson took over the presidency, the idea wasencouraged that he would simply carry on Kennedy administration policies. Insome ways he did. It has been acknowledged that Johnson was able to pushKennedy’s civil rights legislation through Congress where his predecessor mayhave failed. But one emerging Kennedy policy was not continued—that involvedSouth Vietnam.Early in his presidency, Kennedy simply went along with Eisenhower’s policy tocontinue sending military “advisers” and materiel to South Vietnam. In fact,during 1961 and 1962, Kennedy actually increased the US military presence inthat war-torn nation. This may have been due to his desire to avoid at all costsanother foreign-policy disaster such as the Bay of Pigs.But by summer 1963, Kennedy had begun to reevaluate US involvement.By the time Kennedy was elected president in 1960, large-scale guerrilla warfarewas being conducted against the South Vietnam regime. But because of Castro andCuba as well as Soviet incursions in Berlin and the Congo, Vietnam was not anissue during the 1960 campaign. Three days after his election, Kennedy barelynoticed that South Vietnam’s President Diem was the object of an unsuccessfulmilitary coup d’état. In December 1960, the communists announced the formationof the Vietnamese National Liberation Front (the Viet Cong), and the internalguerrilla war got under way in earnest.During 1961 Kennedy, though distracted by the Bay of Pigs Invasion, continued tosupport further US military assistance to Asia, particularly after communistforces seized the city of Phuoc Vinh, only sixty miles from Saigon. On December11, two helicopter companies arrived in South Vietnam, beginning an expandedrole for US advisers. By January 1962, total US military personnel in Vietnamnumbered 2,646. And on January 13, a memorandum from the Joint Chiefs of Staff,titled “The Strategic Importance of the SEA [Southeast Asian] Mainland,” statedthat if the Viet Cong were not soon brought under control, the chiefs saw noalternative but to introduce US ground combat units.Kennedy continued to hesitate about sending combat units to Vietnam. At a newsconference on May 9, 1962, he said, “Introducing American forces . . . also is ahazardous course, and we want to attempt to see if we can work out a peacefulsolution.”According to assistant secretary of state Roger Hilsman, one of Kennedy’s keyforeign policy planners, Kennedy told confidants, “The Bay of Pigs has taught mea number of things. One is not to trust generals or the CIA, and the second isthat if the American people do not want to use American troops to remove acommunist regime 90 miles away from our coast, how can I ask them to use troopsto remove a communist regime 9,000 miles away?”By mid-1963, after receiving conflicting advice and intelligence from hisadvisers regarding Vietnam, Kennedy began to further reassess US commitmentthere. He was especially concerned about the treatment of Buddhists under theDiem government. Thousands of Buddhists were demonstrating for freedom, and onJune 11, the first Buddhist suicide by self-immolation occurred.Reflecting Kennedy’s concern, the State Department notified Saigon, “If Diemdoes not take prompt and effective steps to re-establish Buddhist confidence inhim, we will have to re-examine our entire relationship with his regime.”Diem grew even more unmanageable as 1963 drew on, staffing his government withrelatives and refusing to listen to the pleas of the Buddhists. Talk began aboutreplacing Diem with leaders more agreeable to American policy.The American government, including Kennedy, left no doubt of its displeasurewith Diem, thus paving the way for yet another Vietnamese coup, which occurredon November 1, 1963, just twenty-one days before Kennedy arrived in Dallas.Accompanied by CIA agent Lucien Conein, South Vietnam generals seized keyinstallations and attacked the presidential palace. After hours of fighting,Diem and his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, surrendered. While being taken to thegenerals’ headquarters, both were murdered.Kennedy, who had approved the coup, then rejected it, then okayed it again, wasgenuinely shocked at the murders. Washington was forced to recognize the newmilitary government in Saigon, but for the next twenty months, there were nofewer than ten changes of government as one general overthrew another.It was time for a decision in Vietnam—to support a major American militaryexpedition as the Pentagon desired or to simply withdraw and take the criticismof the anticommunists.The assassination of the Diem brothers may have strengthened Kennedy’s decisionto disengage from Vietnam, and there is evidence that he would have curtailedthe Vietnam War.Kennedy, forever the astute politician, also was very much aware of theapproaching 1964 election.Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana told news reporters that once, following aWhite House leadership meeting, Kennedy had confided to him that he agreed “on aneed for a complete withdrawal from Vietnam,” but he couldn’t do it until afterbeing reelected.The president also may have given a hint as to his plans in a broadcast onSeptember 2, 1963. Speaking of Vietnam, he said, “In the final analysis, it istheir war. They have to win or lose it.”People within the Pentagon and the CIA—who had so much to gain by widening theVietnam War—continued to put out conflicting and often erroneous information.Shortly before the Diem coup, McNamara and General Maxwell Taylor had returnedfrom Saigon and told Kennedy that things were looking better in Vietnam and thatthe United States could withdraw all military personnel by the end of 1965. Onhearing this optimistic assessment, on October 5, 1963, Kennedy approved anAccelerated Withdrawal Program, designed to carry out the promise to end theAmerican military presence by the close of 1965.National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263 stated that at a meeting onOctober 11, 1963, the president considered the recommendations contained in thereport of Secretary McNamara and General Taylor on their mission to SouthVietnam. It read:The President approved the military recommendations [withdrawal by the end of1965] . . . but directed that no formal announcement be made of theimplementation of plans to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963.Such unpublicized moves to disengage from Vietnam allowed anti-Kennedy forces toargue that no change of policy took place.Less than one month after Kennedy’s assassination, McNamara and Taylor changedtheir tune. They reported to President Johnson that conditions in Vietnam weregrave and that a major effort—including American combat troops and a massiveclandestine program—was needed to prevent a communist victory.Kennedy’s covert withdrawal plan ended a mere two days after Kennedy’sassassination when President Johnson signed NSAM 273, which canceled the troopwithdrawal. This document also subtly changed the US objective from simplyassisting the South Vietnamese to assisting them “to win” against thecommunists, and authorized plans for expanding the war into North Vietnam andLaos. The memorandum also ordered senior government officials not to contest orcriticize the changes.It should be noted that a rough draft of NSAM 273, which essentially rescindedKennedy’s withdrawal policy, was found in the Johnson Presidential Library inAustin. It was dated November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination!Someone knew that JFK’s troop reduction order would not be fulfilled.Kennedy aide Kenneth O’Donnell confirmed this in his 1972 book, Johnny, WeHardly Knew Ye. He wrote, “The President’s orders to reduce American militarypersonnel in Vietnam by one thousand before the end of 1963 was still in effecton the day he went to Texas. A few days after his death, during the morning, theorder was quietly rescinded.”Nine months after the assassination, the Vietnam War got into full swing whenCongress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted President Johnsonthe power to wage full-scale war in Southeast Asia. The US military had beensecretly raiding the North Vietnamese coast, and in the adjacent Gulf of Tonkinjittery US sailors egged on by a CIA radio monitoring station had reportedgunfire in the dark and were told they were under attack. By 2012, it was welldocumented and even presented in the mainstream media that the incident in theGulf of Tonkin was phony. There was no attack by North Vietnam and no US sailorwas killed. But within a month of this false-flag incident, Johnson had orderedground combat troops into Vietnam.Obviously, at this late date, no one wants to claim responsibility for aten-year undeclared war that killed 58,000 Americans, caused domestic riots anddemonstrations, engendered lasting hatred between classes and age groups, andaccording to many, nearly wrecked the American economy.Was Kennedy’s embryonic move to disengage in Vietnam a catalyst for hisassassination? Was this the straw that broke the back of the military-industrialcamel?[images/line.jpg]As terrible as it is to contemplate the involvement of the US military in theKennedy assassination, there are many connections between the two. Severalfactors have raised suspicions concerning the military’s role in theassassination.It has been reported that the 112th Military Intelligence Group at 4th ArmyHeadquarters at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio was told to “stand down” thatday rather than report for duty in Dallas, over the “violent” protests of theunit commander, Colonel Maximillian Reich. As noted by CIA-Pentagon liaisonColonel Fletcher Prouty, “Who has the power to make this kind of call? Not LeeOswald, or Castro, or the Mafia . . . only someone with [military code]knowledge can make the call and use such code words that are needed to ‘standdown’ an entire Army unit.”Though apparently some elements of the military intelligence unit did arrive inDallas, their activities there remain obscure. One member may have been with FBIagent James Hosty the morning Kennedy was killed. In Warren Commissiontestimony, Hosty said that forty-five minutes before the assassination he was inthe company of a naval intelligence officer, but he added the meeting had noconnection with Kennedy’s visit.Recall that Agent Hosty’s name, address, phone number, and license number werefound in Lee Harvey Oswald’s personal notebook, which was originally deletedfrom the material turned over to the Warren Commission, and it was Hosty whodestroyed a message from Oswald days after the assassination apparently onorders from superiors.An Army intelligence officer involved in the assassination was special agentJames Powell. Carrying a 35 mm Minolta camera, Powell had taken several photosin Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. He entered the Texas SchoolBook Depository and his presence became public knowledge when he was forced toshow his identification after Dallas police sealed the building. Powell toldresearcher Penn Jones he “worked with the sheriff’s deputies at the rear of theTexas School Book Depository for about six or eight minutes” and that Powell hadordered a news reporter to hang up a telephone on the building’s first floor sothat he could use it.The government has not pursued any meaningful investigation to determine whatintelligence Agent Powell was conducting in Dealey Plaza at the time of theassassination or why he was photographing the exterior of the Depository priorto the shooting.And the military connection becomes even more curious in light of other strangeincidents that occurred in Dallas that day.Dallas police lieutenant Jack Revill told the Warren Commission that a militaryintelligence officer rode with him from Dealey Plaza to the Dallas policestation. It was Revill, as head of the police criminal intelligence division,who submitted a list of Texas School Book Depository employees. Heading Revill’slist was the name “Harvey Lee Oswald,” with the address given as 605 Elsbeth inDallas.During the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation it wasrevealed that the 112th Military Intelligence Group, which maintained an officein Dallas, had possessed a file on a man named “Harvey Lee Oswald,” identifyinghim as a procommunist who had been in Russia and had been involved in pro-Castroactivities in New Orleans. This military file erroneously gave Oswald’s addressas 605 Elsbeth, the same mistake found on Revill’s list.Oswald had lived at 602 Elsbeth in late 1962 and early 1963 but had since moved,and the Elsbeth address had never been given to his employers at the Depository.And, of course, his name was Lee Harvey Oswald. It seems evident, based on thisinformation, that military intelligence tipped off the Dallas police as to theidentity of their suspect.The erroneous information came from military intelligence files. In testimony tothe House Select Committee on Assassinations, the 112th Military IntelligenceGroup’s operations officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Jones, who wasstationed at Fort Sam Houston, said the afternoon of the assassination hereceived a call from his agents in Dallas advising that a man named A. J. Hidellhad been arrested.Jones said he searched his intelligence indexes and located a file on A. J.Hidell that cross-referenced into one for Harvey Lee Oswald of 605 Elsbeth. Hesaid he then contacted the FBI in both San Antonio and Dallas with hisinformation.However, in the vast documentation of Oswald’s life he used the A. J. Hidellalias only twice—when he mail-ordered the Carcano rifle and the pistol and whenhe used the name Hidell on Fair Play for Cuba literature.This indicates that it was US military intelligence that tipped off the Dallaspolice as to the identity of their suspect and raises two possibilities. Eithermilitary intelligence had some independent knowledge of Oswald’s purchase of theweapons, which took place long before he arrived in New Orleans, or they weremonitoring his Dallas post office box. Or did someone, perhaps even Oswaldhimself, inform the military of his purchases?The files on Hidell and Oswald gave detailed information about Oswald’s trip toRussia as well as pro-Castro activities in New Orleans. Jones said he had becomeaware of Oswald in the summer of 1963 when information had been passed along bythe New Orleans Police Department regarding his arrest there. He said the 112thMilitary Intelligence Group took an interest in Oswald as a possiblecounterintelligence threat.The House committee, remarking on how quickly the military found files onOswald, stated, “This information suggested the existence of a militaryintelligence file on Oswald and raised the possibility that he had intelligenceassociations of some kind.”The Warren Commission specifically asked to see any military files regardingOswald but never saw the files mentioned by Jones or others.In 1978, when the House Select Committee on Assassinations learned of thesefiles and requested them from the military, they were told the files had been“destroyed routinely” in 1973. The committee concluded:The committee found this “routine” destruction of the Oswald file extremelytroublesome, especially when viewed in light of the Department of Defense’sfailure to make the file available to the Warren Commission. Despite thecredibility of Jones’ testimony, without access to this file, the question ofOswald’s possible affiliation with military intelligence could not be fullyresolved.It appears that the US military knew more about Oswald and his weapons than hasbeen made public yet destroyed all the files when talk of a reinvestigationbegan in the early 1970s. But does that mean the military orchestrated theassassination?It is ironic that of all our modern presidents, it was John F. Kennedy whoreceived the only full military funeral in recent history. Why Kennedy? Why notEisenhower? Was this the military’s way of making atonement?In early 2013, the Elsbeth apartment building was bulldozed on orders of Dallasofficials despite protests by the owner, who said she tried to renovate it andpreserve it.The Man Who Was to Kill Oswald [Contents.html#rsec62][Since the first edition of Crossfire, readers have pondered the meaning of theheading above but that was followed by no copy. Apparently it was decided todelete the entire section in an effort to save costs but someone forgot todelete the heading. Here is the long-missing section. For an excellent and moredetailed account of this story, see Dick Russell’s 1992 book The Man Who KnewToo Much.]According to one soldier’s account, there was even an attempt to prevent theassassination by killing a key player—Lee Harvey Oswald.The man’s name was Richard Case Nagell and he told one of the strangest and mostsinister stories to come out of the Kennedy assassination. As pieced togetherfrom interviews and court documents and a national magazine article in 1981 bywriter and researcher Dick Russell, Nagell’s story delved into the complex andmurky world of military intelligence, the CIA, and the FBI.Raised in an orphanage and foster homes, Nagell entered the Army in 1948 at ageeighteen. During the Korean War, he was the youngest American to receive abattlefield commission. He was awarded three Purple Hearts and a Bronze Starwhile serving in Korea and honorably discharged in 1959 with the rank ofcaptain.Military papers disclosed that Nagell graduated from Army Military IntelligenceSchool and a special leader’s course, and served in the CounterintelligenceCorps. According to his records, he was given a top-secret security clearance in1950. One of his commendation certificates described Nagell as a “perennial calmand level-headed officer of superior intelligence.”According to courtroom testimony, in 1958 military intelligence “loaned” Nagellto “another intelligence agency” for assignments in Asia as part of a spy groupcalled Field Operations Intelligence.As a senior intelligence adviser in South Korea, Nagell admitted participatingin political assassinations, kidnapping, blackmail, and counterfeitingoperations. By 1957, he had told superiors he was “fed up” with committingcrimes in the name of national security and was reassigned tocounterintelligence duties in Japan. It was here, he said, he first met a youngMarine stationed at Atsugi named Lee Harvey Oswald.“We had a casual, but purposeful acquaintance in Japan,” Nagell told Russell.“My relationship with Oswald there, and later in the United States, was strictlywith an objective.”About this time, Nagell married a Japanese woman and, at her urging, resignedhis commission, returned to the United States, and went to work for the State ofCalifornia. In 1962, amid marital problems, he left his wife and two childrenand journeyed to Mexico City.In Mexico, Nagell said, he contacted a CIA man he had previously known andsigned a contract with the agency, becoming a double agent. He was to work forthe Soviet KGB while actually serving the CIA.The Soviets informed him of a plot to kill Kennedy involving the violentanti-Castro Cuban group known as Alpha 66 and ordered Nagell to return to theUnited States to learn more. The KGB even provided Nagell with a photograph ofone of the plotters. Nagell was shocked to find it was his old acquaintance LeeHarvey Oswald.Nagell echoed the story from Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko when he told Russell,“When he [Oswald] was in the Soviet Union, they suspected him as a spy andconsidered him emotionally unstable, prone to commit some act that could bringembarrassment to them.”Nagell would not give details about what he discovered concerning Oswald in thefall of 1962, but he did say, “He was just being used—by a lot of people, fortheir own reasons.” Nagell said he became aware of at least two Kennedyassassination plots during this time, both involving Cubans, whose “war names”were “Angel” and “Leopaldo,” the same names given to Silvia Odio.According to Nagell, the CIA-backed Alpha 66 Cubans convinced Oswald they weremembers of Castro’s intelligence service and solicited his help in assassinatingKennedy to avenge CIA assassination plots against Castro. Since the evidencesuggests Oswald was actually playing as an undercover agent of the UnitedStates, he would, of course, have gone along with these schemes to learn all hecould about the plots. Nagell said he actually got close enough to the plottingto tape a New Orleans meeting in late August 1963.Nagell was then ordered by KGB officials fearful of being implicated in anassassination to disrupt the Kennedy plot. “[I was to] try to persuade Oswaldthat the deal was phony and if this didn’t work, and if it looked like thingswere going to progress beyond the talking stage, to get rid of him,” saidNagell, explaining that considering Oswald’s background in Russia, the Soviets“were the last people that wanted Kennedy dead” in a plot involving Oswald.Nagell said he met with Oswald in early September in New Orleans’s JacksonSquare. Unwilling to break his cover as a KGB operative, Nagell neverthelesstried to warn Oswald that “Angel” and “Leopoldo” were not Castro agents, but“counter-revolutionaries known to be connected with a violence-prone faction ofa CIA-financed groupo.” Later, Nagell related:He was informed that he was being “used” by fascist elements in an attempt todisrupt the Cuban revolution, and probably to incite the US Government to severeretaliatory measures against Cuba, etc. He denied that there had been anyserious discussion to kill Kennedy. He seemed genuinely upset and visiblyshaken. . . . He stated he was a friend of the Cuban revolution.Frustrated that Oswald still maintained his own “cover,” Nagell then sent aregistered letter to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, warning of the assassinationplot and naming both Oswald and the Cubans but stating that the plot might occurin late September in Washington, DC.After sending this letter, Nagell said, he again met with Oswald and told him aSoviet agent code-named “Oaxaca” wanted to meet Oswald in Mexico City. Accordingto Nagell:He (Oswald) was instructed not to go near the Cuban or U.S.S.R. embassies.Oswald agreed to do so when he was advised that he would be provided with morethan sufficient funds to make the trip to and from Mexico City by plane. He wastold where and how he was to pick up the money order on 9/24/63, his expecteddate of departure from New Orleans.On September 17, the day Oswald picked up his Mexican tourist card in NewOrleans, Nagell was already on his way to Mexico City, carrying a .45-caliberColt pistol to use on Oswald.But Nagell began to have second thoughts about his role as a double agent and asan assassin. On September 20, he instead drove to El Paso and entered the StateNational Bank. According to Russell, “He had decided he could not go throughwith the KGB’s assignment. Doubtful about which master he was really serving,unable to kill a man and then face life abroad without his children, he choseinstead to get himself placed in federal custody.”After all, he had alerted the FBI, although the bureau predictably denied everhaving received his letter. The matter was out of his hands. While in jailawaiting trial for bank robbery, Nagell was visited often by both FBI and SecretService agents, according to jailer Juan Medina. Two FBI agents visited Nagellon November 19, only three days before the assassination. Early in 1964, Nagellwas brought before US district judge Homer Thornberry in El Paso. The El PasoTimes reported, “Instead of asking for a plea, Fred Morton, assistant USDistrict Attorney made a motion to put Nagell in a federal institution inSpringfield, Mo., for psychiatric observation. The motion was granted overNagell’s vigorous objections.”The newspaper also reported that FBI and Secret Service agents had questionedNagell about Oswald and “subversive activities.” On March 20, 1964, Nagell triedto communicate with the Warren Commission, writing, “Has the Commission beenadvised that I informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in September 1963that an attempt might be made to assassinate President Kennedy?”Despite this letter and the attention paid to Nagell by the FBI and SecretService, there is no mention of him in the Warren Report or its attendanttwenty-six volumes. Nagell again wrote to Hoover:My responsibility concerning the then prospective action of Lee H. Oswald(alias) Albert Hidell, terminated with the dispatch of the registered letterfrom Richard Nagell to the FBI in September 1963. Since the informationdisclosed in that letter was judged to be mendacious by the FBI, as is quiteevident, then with whom the responsibility lies for what subsequently happenedin Dallas is rather obvious.In March 1964, Nagell was declared competent to stand trial and, although he hadno previous criminal record and the holdup was obviously faked, he was convictedof two counts of entering a bank with intent to rob and given the maximumsentence of ten years in the US Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.His conviction was overturned in 1966 and a new trial ordered. Again he wasfound guilty and again drew a ten-year prison term. However, this was reversedin 1968 by the US Court of Appeals “in view of strong evidence that defendantwas insane at time of offense.” Nagell finally was set free.But he was not truly free. He claimed he was followed and hounded and thatattempts were made on his life. Nagell died of heart disease in 1995 at the ageof sixty-five. It should be noted that the government has often used criminaland medical history documents, whether real or otherwise, to discredit testimonyfrom people who might challenge the official version of an event.But other military men apparently did not have such benign intentions towardPresident Kennedy and assassination.Lone Gunmen on the Grassy Knoll [Contents.html#rsec63]By 2013, numerous people had been identified as a possible Grassy Knoll gunman.But to this author’s knowledge only four identified persons have actuallyconfessed and all started out as American GIs. Of these four, only two offeredany real evidence and even this was contradictory and far from conclusive.The story of one of these men, Loy Factor, became public when researchers MarkCollom and Glen Sample self-published the 1995 book The Men on the Sixth Floor.Collom had met Lawrence Lloyd Factor when both were hospitalized in 1971.Factor’s story seemed so farfetched that both the publishing world and mostresearchers ignored it.Loy Factor was a Native American who claimed to have suffered brain damage whileserving in the military during World War II. His story, as recounted by authorRobin Ramsey in the 2007 book Who Shot JFK?, was this:Factor met a man he knew only as Wallace in 1962 at the funeral of a Texaspolitician. Factor said he went along just to see some famous people. In thecourse of their conversation, Factor boasted to Wallace of his shooting andhunting skills. Wallace was interested and asked for Factor’s address. A yearlater he turned up and asked for a demonstration of Factor’s shooting ability.Having seen it, the man told Factor that he might have a job for him in thefuture using his rifle, a job worth $10,000—$2,000 immediately and the rest whenthe job was done. Factor accepted the $2,000. . . . Later the man sent forFactor to do the job. Factor was taken to a house in Dallas where he met JackRuby, the man called Wallace, Lee Harvey Oswald and a young Hispanic woman, RuthAnn. They ended up on the sixth floor of the book depository. [After firingcoordinated shots at Kennedy, the group] fled quickly down the stairs—Ruth Annand Factor to their parked car, Oswald and Wallace in different directions. Loywas driven to the bus depot, a few blocks away where he was to catch a bus backhome. But in a short while Ruth Ann and Wallace both returned to the depot topick up Factor and drive him out of town.It would be easy enough to dismiss Factor’s story, especially since he claimedto have collected $10,000 for his role yet never fired a rifle, except for thefact that years after publishing their book, Collom and Sample learned Wallace’sfirst name was Malcolm or Mac and in 1998 heard that a group of Texasresearchers had identified fingerprints found on the sixth floor of the TexasSchool Book Depository the day of the assassination could be traced to Malcolm“Mac” Wallace, a convicted killer for hire, a longtime associate of Lyndon B.Johnson’s, and the man at the center of Factor’s story. Factor also correctlyrecalled that the rear of the Depository faced north and there was a woodenloading dock there that was taken down not long after the assassination.Wallace, who died in a car accident in 1971, was elected president of theStudent Union at the University of Texas at Austin after returning home from theMarines during World War II. In 1950, he was introduced to Lyndon Johnson byJohnson’s attorney Ed Clark and soon was working for the US Department ofAgriculture in Texas. In October 1951, Wallace was arrested and convicted in themurder-for-hire death of Austin miniature golf course owner John Kinser, whoreportedly was in ill favor with Johnson due to his dating Johnson’s sister,Josefa. Represented by Johnson’s attorneys, Wallace nevertheless was convicted,with eleven of the jurors calling for the death penalty. However, the trialjudge overruled the jury and announced a sentence of five years’ imprisonment,which he immediately suspended.This was not the only murder attributed to Wallace. Several deaths occurredduring government investigations into Johnson’s business dealings but the onethat gained the most attention was the shooting death of Henry Marshall, theAgriculture Department official looking into illegalities by Texas cottonallotment kingpin Billie Sol Estes. Estes died in 2013 at age eighty-eight.The Marshall case came to a climax in August 1984 when, after hearing Billie SolEstes relate that he was present when Johnson, Wallace, and Johnson aide CliffCarter plotted to “get rid” of Marshall, a Robertson County grand jury changedthe Marshall suicide ruling to one of homicide.On the day of the assassination, some twenty-odd fingerprints recovered from thesixth floor of the Depository could not be connected to either Oswald, otherDepository employees, or investigators. These prints were placed in the NationalArchives and generally forgotten except by John F. “Jay” Harrison, a Dallaspolice reservist and JFK assassination researcher. Harrison arrived on the sceneof the assassination within minutes and maintained his research until his deathin May 2005.In the late 1990s, Harrison enlisted the aid of Nathan Darby, the retired headof the Austin, Texas, Police Department’s Identification and Criminal RecordsSection, in matching the Depository prints with a jail card belonging to MacWallace. According to Darby, there was a fourteen-point match between theprints. US courts generally accept a ten-to twelve-point comparison as proof ofa match. These results were made public at a news conference in May 1998, whereit was announced there was no doubt that Wallace was one of the shooters.Naturally, opposition to any idea other than that of a lone assassin swung intogear, and controversy still reigns over the Wallace-fingerprint issue,especially since both Harrison and Darby are now deceased and cannot counter anyaccusations. Darby’s analysis was submitted to the FBI for comment. Predictably,after dragging their feet for more than a year, bureau officials stated theprint match was in error but failed to produce any supporting data or their ownanalysis.It does stretch the imagination to the breaking point to believe that LyndonJohnson would have been stupid enough to allow a convicted hit man who could beconnected to him within fifty miles of Dallas on November 22, 1963. Someresearchers theorize that Wallace’s prints may have been planted on the sixthfloor by someone else in an effort to ensure Johnson’s ongoing cooperation.James E. Files, born James Sutton, on the other hand, also was a soldier and hasclaimed to be the Grassy Knoll gunman. He definitely can be connected to boththe government (both CIA and military) and the Chicago mob.Entering the US Army in 1959, Files said he was eventually sent to Laos tooperate with secret counterinsurgency US forces called “White Star” teams.Colonel Fletcher L. Prouty confirmed to this author that he was involved withsuch teams but had never heard of Files. While in the military, Files said, hewas recruited into CIA operations by David Atlee Phillips, the same personJudyth Vary Baker named as Oswald’s handler.After leaving the military, Files said, he became a race car driver and wasrecruited as a driver by Charles “Chuckie” Nicoletti, described as a premier hitman for the Chicago Mafia. Files said it was Nicoletti who sent him to Dallaswith a Chevrolet Impala loaded with guns after an assassination attempt onKennedy in Chicago failed in early November 1963.Once in Dallas, Files said, he called David Phillips to inform him he hadarrived and soon he was visited at his motel by Lee Harvey Oswald, who arriveddriving a green pickup truck similar to one owned by Jack Ruby. Although Oswaldreportedly had no driver’s license, such a technicality has never stopped othersfrom driving. As will be seen, this was not the only incident of Oswald drivinga vehicle. Files said Oswald drove him around showing road exits out of Dallas.Files said he then knew the operation was being orchestrated by Phillips, sinceno one in the Chicago mob knew Oswald.By the morning of November 22, 1963, his boss Nicoletti had arrived in Dallasalong with mobster Johnny Roselli, who claimed to have flown in on a “militaryflight.” Files said on orders from Nicoletti, he drove Roselli to nearby FortWorth, where he watched as Roselli received a package from a man at a pancakerestaurant. On the drive back to Dallas, Roselli told Files the man was amob-connected nightclub owner named Jack Ruby and that the package containedphony Secret Service identification as well as security plans for Kennedy’smotorcade. As outlandish as this may sound, it is supported by Ruby’s sister EvaGrant, who later told authorities that Ruby had the motorcade security plans inadvance. A letter marked “personal and confidential” to Dallas police chiefJesse Curry from Dallas FBI chief J. Gordon Shanklin dated April 13, 1964,reported that Grant told the bureau that “we” had been given a copy of thesecurity plans for Kennedy’s visit prior to his arrival.Later that morning, despite the overcast weather with some drizzle, Files said,he and Nicoletti strolled along the Grassy Knoll in Dealey Plaza, laying theirplans. Nicoletti said Roselli mentioned an “abort team” to stop theassassination and that he was getting cold feet about involving CIA personnel.Files was told Roselli wanted out and that Nicoletti recruited him as backup. Itwas understood that Files was not to fire from the knoll unless it appeared thatKennedy might leave the plaza alive, and that Mrs. Kennedy was not to be harmed.Files said the weapon he chose was an experimental model Remington XP-100.222-caliber pistol with a foregrip called the “Fireball.” A gunsmith for themob had loaded the bullet tips with mercury, which created an explosive effect.According to Files, the mercury created “all the killing power of a 30.06” inthe smaller weapon.As the motorcade came into alignment with his position, Files said, he decidedhe must make his shot. He fired one round that struck Kennedy in his righttemple (from Files’s position, this was initially described as the left templecausing considerable confusion and criticism until he clarified it). Afterbiting on the shell casing and leaving it behind on the knoll’s wooden picketfence as a “calling card,” Files then loaded the Fireball into a briefcase andcasually walked away to join Nicoletti and Roselli at a car parked near theDal-Tex Building, from where Files later learned Nicoletti had fired a rifle.The trio drove away unchallenged.This whole convoluted story began in 1987 when a Dallas-area man named JohnRademacher told Texas assassination researchers he had recently found two.222-caliber shell cases with the aid of a metal detector on the Grassy Knoll.One was located about ten feet east of the picket fence close to the pergolawhere Zapruder stood, while the other was some sixty feet farther to thenortheast. One of the casings had an odd-shaped ring around the neck.Among those who heard Rademacher’s account was Texas private investigator JosephH. West, who had already developed an intense interest in the JFK assassinationcase. West previously had gathered information that Nicoletti and Roselli mayhave been involved. Nationally syndicated columnist Jack Anderson wrote thatRoselli on more than one occasion had indicated to him that he may haveparticipated in the assassination. A 1999 book by Salvatore “Bill” Bonanno, theson of crime boss Joseph Bonanno, also claimed Roselli played a role in theassassination. Offering no evidence, Bonanno said Roselli fired from a drainpipealong Elm Street and was aided by French mobsters.It must be emphasized that Files himself never sought publicity by going publicwith his story. This was the result of a tip from retired FBI agent Zechariah“Zack” Shelton, who had worked organized-crime cases during his time with thebureau. Shelton told West in the early 1990s that if anyone left alive knewabout the assassination, it was most probably James Files, who by then wasserving time in the Statesville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois, in aseparate case involving the shooting of a police officer. West subsequentlytracked down Files and approached him for his story. Files initially refused totalk but eventually warmed up to the personable West and finally agreed to talk,with the understanding that he would not betray anyone in the mob who was stillalive.West prepared for a formal taped interview with Files. About this same time, hefiled a forty-five-page motion in federal district court to have the body ofPresident Kennedy exhumed and examined by forensic pathologists, including Dr.Charles Wetli, the deputy chief medical examiner of Dade County, Florida. In anaffidavit, Dr. Wetli said a postmortem examination could show whether Kennedy’sbody had been tampered with in an attempt to skew the autopsy results. “If we’regiven an opportunity to exhume, it will settle all these arguments,” said West.His motion was rejected by federal judge Norman Black but West said he plannedto appeal to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.Before either his appeal or the Files interview could take place, West entered ahospital for heart surgery in early 1993. He did not recover and those close tohis situation, including his wife, did not believe his death was a natural one.His exhumation suit was dismissed for lack of prosecution and the Filesinterview was turned over to Houston photographer/researcher Robert G. Vernon,who proceeded with the Files interview.After initial taping had been completed, Vernon learned from Files about hisbiting on a shell casing following the assassination and recalled the Rademacherstory from West’s notes. Vernon obtained the shell casing from Rademacher andsent it to Dr. Paul G. Stimson of Houston, a member of the American Board ofOral Pathology and the American Board of Forensic Pathology. No mention was madeof the Kennedy assassination; Stimson was simply asked to analyze the .222Remington spent casing. In a letter dated October 4, 1993, Dr. Stimson, afterdescribing in detail the marks on the casing, concluded, “The indentations areoriented on the shell casing in a pattern that would be consistent with themaxillary right central incisor making the larger mark and the two smaller markswould be consistent with the lower right central and lateral incisors. It is myopinion that the marks are consistent with having been made by human dentition.”Human teeth marks on the casing appeared to be tangible evidence that connectedFiles with the Grassy Knoll. However, like so much else in the assassinationcase, giant holes began to appear in this story.Once informed of the JFK assassination connection, Dr. Stimson backtracked onhis analysis of the casing marks as from human teeth. In addition, there hasnever been any explanation for the second .222-caliber shell casing found on theGrassy Knoll. Files said he fired only one. Other details of Files’s story alsofailed to check out. Some researchers suspected that West may have unconsciouslypassed along assassination information in the form of questions to Files that heused to bolster his claims.A final blow to Files’s account may have come in 2006, when researcher AllanEaglesham, following a painstaking investigation into the little-known world ofballistics and headstamps on ammunition, published a paper titled “The Tell-TaleDash: James Files and the Dented Cartridge Case,” in which he demonstrated thatthe .222 shell casings Radenmacher found could not have been manufactured before1971. If proven correct, this dismisses them, and hence Files’s account, as trueassassination evidence.Then there is the strange case of John Christian, who in a 2010 deathbedconfession claimed he was the Grassy Knoll gunman.Calling himself a “wild child,” Christian grew up hunting in rural Texas. Heclaimed he could “hit a frog’s eye with a non-military rifle.” His mother abusedhim, sometimes beating him with a two-by-four board. Christian said he ran awayfrom home before he was ten years old and “took care of himself.” Often introuble with the law, he was given the choice between jail or the military.Finishing training at Fort Polk, Louisiana, in early 1963, Christian said, hewas sent by train to Alaska, where he distinguished himself with his shootingprowess.In late November 1963, Christian said he was pulled out of field maneuvers andtold he was to eliminate a threat to national security. He learned his targetwas to be President Kennedy, who he was told was “doing a lot of drugs” andwould likely start World War III. “I felt I was just a patriotic man doing myjob,” said Christian later.On November 21, Christian said, he was flown by helicopter to Eielson Air ForceBase near Fairbanks, Alaska, and from there via military plane to Carswell AirForce Base in Fort Worth, Texas. He was then taken to the Cellar club indowntown Fort Worth, where he slept on the floor of the kitchen while SecretService agents were “debriefed” in the main club area. The next morning, he wasdriven to Dallas and given a choice of weapons in the vehicle’s truck. “I choseone with an open sight—no scope,” he said.Lying prone on a mat along the north–south axis of the wooden picket fence atopthe Grassy Knoll, Christian said, he fired a rifle through a small gap in thefence. He said there were men in suits to shield him from any interference.After he struck Kennedy in the head, he said he simply walked away while anotherman left with the rifle wrapped in a coat and yet another picked up the mat.Christian’s most astounding claim was that he was returned to his base in Alaskaby a high-flying jet and arrived there in time to stand with an honor guard thatevening for the fallen president.He said he left the Army within two years on a hardship discharge and returnedto north Texas. After a stint as a mercenary, he eventually became a ruralcounty judge with a respectable reputation. In 2006 he was diagnosed withinoperable cancer and decided to tell his story to attorney Sheila Grace Neal ofAzle, Texas. Neal confirmed one of Christian’s claims—that he had paid no taxessince 1965. This apparently was partial payment for his role in theassassination. “I’ve seen his tax records,” reported Neal. “He owed taxes but hewas never required to pay them.”Christian died from cancer in June 2010, just days after giving his account tothis author. Like other assassination stories, at this late date and because heclaimed his military records were all stolen from him by “men in suits” in thelate 1960s, there appeared no way to independently corroborate his confession.A recent addition to the confessed gunmen is a man who only called himself“Anonymous.” In the book The Man on the Grassy Knoll, reportedly publishedposthumously in 2011, he tells a compelling but dubious tale of being recruitedout of college by a CIA operative named “Mr. Smith.” This tale concerns aconspiracy of only three—the anonymous narrator, Smith, and Lee Harvey Oswald,whom he knew only as Ozzie Hidell. His story could have been acquired fromassassination literature and there are some questionable statements: Jack Rubyacted entirely on his own, Oswald’s employment at the Depository was a sheeraccident, and the conspirators shared drinks in a downtown Dallas hotel at atime when no one could buy mixed drinks in the city.The same problem of buying alcoholic drinks in dry 1963 Dallas appeared in theconfession of an assassin called only “Saul” in a 1975 book, Appointment inDallas: The Final Solution to the Assassination of JFK, by former Los AngelesCounty sheriff’s detective Hugh C. McDonald. Saul confessed to McDonald during aone-time meeting in England that he fired on Kennedy from the Dallas CountyRecords Building.Serious researchers believe that as a means of cover-up, several crediblepersons were spoon-fed such false “confessions” to confuse future investigators,a common disinformation practice in the intelligence field.While there is a lack of evidence to support such stories, they do serve as agood example of how a truly experienced sniper could have been insinuated intoany number of assassination plots. The shooter could do his job and walk awaywithout any contact or knowledge of any other participants. This type ofredundant backup contingency also is typical of military/intelligence planning.Such a tactic ensures that a morass of false leads and red herrings are leftbehind to confuse investigators.So it would appear that the best guess for the Grassy Knoll gunman is that ofRoscoe White, whose story also has been dismissed by most due to the lack ofverification even after nationwide publicity.Roscoe Anthony White, nicknamed Rock, reportedly left behind a diary detailinghis role in the assassination. This became known through his son, Ricky DonWhite, a high school football hero from Paris, Texas. Ricky White saidinvolvement in the assassination case may have begun in early childhood, when herecalled a hunting trip with his father to west Texas in the fall of 1963. Hesaw his father practice shooting rifles with two other men from high positionsinto an open car.He also recalled that on the Sunday Ruby killed Oswald, the elder White arrivedhome, appeared very agitated, and suddenly left Dallas with his family.Earlier, on October 7, 1963, White had joined the Dallas Police Department.While in training he was assigned to the Crime Scene Search Section, whichincluded work in the police photographic lab. He resigned from the police inOctober 1965 and in 1971 was killed in a freak explosion at a Dallas businesswhere he worked as a shop foreman. He received a Masonic funeral on September27, 1971.Ricky White recalled that in 1975 investigators from the House Select Committeeon Assassinations questioned his mother, Geneva, about her employment with JackRuby and a backyard photograph of Lee Oswald never before known to exist. Theexistence of this unpublicized third backyard Oswald photo—and especially thefact that the exact pose in this photo was re-created by authorities in a photopublished by the Warren Commission—proved that evidence against Oswald wassuppressed while in the hands of the government.It was during the time of the committee that a neighbor warned Ricky that theHSCA might make public his father’s name in connection with the assassination.He was told that Roscoe had belonged to something called “JTAG” (“Don’t ask mewhat that means,” said the neighbor who claimed to have worked for USintelligence), a team of specially trained soldiers sent into differentcountries to create wars and conflicts, including assassination plots.When White’s name was never mentioned by the HSCA, Ricky White tried to forgetthe whole thing. By 1982, he and his family were living in west Texas, when hereceived word that his grandfather W. S. Toland had died. The Toland family hadacted as surrogate parents to Ricky.Following the funeral, family members gathered at Toland’s Paris home and weregoing through his effects. It was in a storage shed in the backyard that Rickyfound an old Marine footlocker belonging to Roscoe. Inside were a Bell andHowell camera, several press clippings regarding the JFK assassination, a bankdeposit box key, and a small book filled with handwritten notes. The book was adiary that mentioned $500,000 in bearer bonds in a bank deposit box.Ricky found the diary entry for November 22, 1963, chilling. He read it over andover, committing it to memory. He recalled that it stated:Lebanon [a code name for one of the assassins] (Sixth Floor), Saul [another codename] (Records Building), Mandarin [Roscoe White’s code name] (Stockade Fence).Shots fired from upper buildings for diversion. Shots fired, looks as if targetwas hit. Shot from fence, definite hit. Man on other side fence in way. Shotsagain from upper buildings, no hit. Target open, fired, definite hit. Gunretrieved by man to the side, took to railroad area. Whirled over fence, tookman down to protect myself. Ran around back of fence, down embankment to car.Drove to Oak Cliff, met officer. Told officer not to drive by house. Somethingwas at this point wrong. Forced to take out officer at 10th and Patton. Notgoing as planned. Back tracked to car, drove back to the area of take out tolocate other passenger. Failed to transport subject to Redbird. Realized what amistake I had made, hope it is all over. Back to DPD awaiting information.Ricky immediately took this information to his mother, who had briefly workedfor Jack Ruby in the fall of 1963. She told him she knew nothing of the diarybut that she had suspected Roscoe may have had something to do with theassassination.Not certain how to proceed, in 1988 Ricky contacted Midland, Texas, districtattorney Al Schorre for help in opening the bank deposit box. He also toldSchorre about the diary. Schorre and his assistant initially were excited overthe find, as were some local oilmen who financed Ricky’s efforts to investigatethe matter. The FBI was notified. Agents made a duplicate of the bank depositbox key but Ricky was never able to access the box. “I think the FBI made$500,000,” he speculated later. With the federal government involvement, localinterest waned.Ricky was taken to FBI offices in Midland and questioned for five hours byagents Ron Butler and Tom Farris. They alternately coaxed Ricky for informationand threatened him with charges of withholding evidence. After reading thediary, Agent Butler told Ricky, “Your father has a fanciful imagination.”Exhausted, Ricky was finally allowed to return home with his materials. As herested, Agent Farris arrived and asked to retrieve a notepad he said he hadinadvertently left in Ricky’s belongings. The agent quickly returned from whereRicky had laid out his materials, said, “I got what I came for. Sorry for theinterruption,” and left. The diary has not been seen since.However, in June 1990, further support for Roscoe’s involvement came with thediscovery of a steel canister at his grandfather’s house. Inside were threecoded messages that today are in the hands of an assassination researcher. Allthree messages carried the same heading, which read:Navy Int.Code A M R CRemark data1666106NRC VRC NACThe first message was dated on “? . . . 63.” It stated:Foreign affairs assignments have been cancelled. The next assignment is toeliminate a national security threat to worldwide peace. Destination will beHouston, Austin or Dallas. Contacts are being arranged now. Orders are subjectto change at any time. Reply back if not understood.All are signed, “C. BowerS, OSHA, Re-rifle Code AAA destroy / on/”A message dated September 1963 read:Dallas destination chosen. Your place hidden within the department. Contacts arewithin this letter. Continue on as planned.The final message dated December 1963 stated:Stay within department. Witnesses have eyes, ears and mouth. You [unclear] do ofthe mix up. The men will be in to cover all misleading evidence soon. Stay asplanned. Wait for further notice.By 1990, the story of the diary had become known and Ricky was thrown into aworld of publicity and entrepreneurs, culminating in an August 1990 pressconference in the now-defunct JFK Assassination Information Center in Dallas.Here the entire story was made public along with the results of a lie detectortest Ricky took a month earlier. It indicated truthfulness in all questions.Researchers rushed to examine the Roscoe White story.It was learned that Roscoe White was stationed at the Marine base at El Toro,California, at the same time as Lee Harvey Oswald. Further, White shipped outfrom California to duty in Japan aboard the USS Bexar, the same ship carryingOswald. Both White and Oswald served in the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. Both Rockand Oswald were released from the Marines with a hardship discharge, like JohnChristian.Based on White’s broad, flat chin and a knot on his right wrist, it has beenclaimed that it was Roscoe White’s body onto which Oswald’s face wassuperimposed in the famous backyard photographs. In 1992, Beverly Oliver, the“babushka lady,” told researcher Mark Oates that just after the shooting she sawa Dallas policeman coming down from the Grassy Knoll. She said she did not knowhim but recognized him as the husband of Geneva White, who she knew worked forJack Ruby. Even Texas attorney general Dan Morales opened an investigation fileon the Roscoe White issue.Then it all fell apart.Since the diary was missing and the coded messages did not specifically connectto the assassination, stronger proof was needed. Suddenly a second diary wasmade public but was almost immediately found to be a forgery. Someone—GenevaWhite was accused—had fabricated it. With this evidence of falsification, theattorney general, the media, and the public quickly lost interest in the RoscoeWhite case.Today this issue is largely forgotten, although no one has explained the codedmessages or even the original diary, which was seen by several people beforedisappearing into the hands of the FBI, yet another example of conspiracyevidence being suppressed by the government.DEALEY PLAZA, DALLAS, TEXAS, 1963 [images/graphics01.jpg]DEALEY PLAZA, DALLAS, TEXAS, 1963 1.

Alteration ofZapruder film frames (top) is demonstrated by comparing a painted black patch onthe rear of JFK’s head (frame 317) with normal shadow (frame 257). Hollywoodfilm experts have agreed that the signs of retouching are both obvious andcrude. Many people still believe the erroneous conspiracy theory that thedriver, Secret Service agent William Greer, turned and shot Kennedy with apistol. A clear blowup of Zapruder film frame 314 (bottom) clearly shows nopistol and that Greer’s hands remained on the steering wheel. However, Greer’stestimony contradicted his actions as seen in the film, prompting some suspicionof Secret Service complicity. What some people believed to have been a gun ismerely sunlight reflecting off of Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman’s greasedhair.SURVEYORS’ MAP ALTERED—Dallas County surveyor Robert West and his associate,Chester Breneman, were both hired to survey Dealey Plaza, first by Time-Life,Inc., and later in 1964 by the Warren Commission. [images/graphics05.jpg]SURVEYORS’ MAP ALTERED—Dallas County surveyor Robert West and his associate,Chester Breneman, were both hired to survey Dealey Plaza, first by Time-Life,Inc., and later in 1964 by the Warren Commission. In both studies they said itwas apparent that the assassination involved more than one gunman. Here is acopy of their original plat map provided by Breneman. They mention among otherthings a tree that obstructed any early shot from the Depository’s sixth flooras well as an extraneous bullet strike on the south curb of Elm Street. Thesenotations contradicted the government’s conclusion of a lone assassin. Alongwith certain Zapruder film-frame numbers used to time the assassination, theWest-Breneman information was altered by the Warren Commission before being madepublic. Without absolute accuracy in time, distances, and elevations, nocomputer analysis of the assassination can be considered valid.SMOKE ON THE GRASSY KNOLL—The long-standing controversy over whether or notsmoke from a rifle was seen drifting down from the Grassy Knoll ended in the1980s when this frame of a film by NBC cameraman Dave Weigman was made public.[images/graphics06.jpg][images/graphics07.jpg]SMOKE ON THE GRASSY KNOLL—The long-standing controversy over whether or notsmoke from a rifle was seen drifting down from the Grassy Knoll ended in the1980s when this frame of a film by NBC cameraman Dave Weigman was made public. Amodern rifle can produce a white puff of smoke, especially if recently oiled.This photo confirmed the presence of the puff of gun smoke (circled upper right)both seen and smelled by several witnesses as the Kennedy limousine entered theTriple Underpass (circled center). Bystanders quickly rushed up the Grassy Knollwhere most of those in the west end of Dealey Plaza believed shots originated.GUNMAN ON THE GRASSY KNOLL—A blowup of a section of the Polaroid picture takenby Mary Moorman at the time of the fatal head shot reveals a man in the classicrifle-firing position behind the wooden picket fence atop the infamous GrassyKnoll.

The smudge on the right of the photo is a fingerprint due to the failureto apply a fixative to the photo at the time. In the blowup, one can discern thefigure’s hairline, eyebrows, and left ear over a bright spot that could beeither a muzzle flash or smoke from a weapon. The man is wearing a dark shirtwith a bright spot on his left chest, which computer analysis showed to bemetal, along with a semicircular patch on his left shoulder. These accoutrementshave been compared to the black Dallas police uniforms with their badges andtheir semicircular patches on their left arms, leading the figure to be calledthe “badgeman.”Photoanalysis by Jack White and Gary MackTHE SNIPER’S NEST—This view from the “sniper’s nest” on the sixth floor of theTexas School Book Depository reveals several problems with the lone-assassintheory of the JFK assassination. [images/graphics10.jpg]THE SNIPER’S NEST—This view from the “sniper’s nest” on the sixth floor of theTexas School Book Depository reveals several problems with the lone-assassintheory of the JFK assassination. The dark triangle at bottom right is the floor,only about a foot below the window, which was only half open on November 22,1963, as shown here. Two pipes to the immediate left of the window provideserious obstacles to anyone attempting to aim a rifle down Elm Street.Additionally, the live oak tree on the street below obscures the line of sightfrom the window to the center of Elm where today an overhead highway sign marksthe location of the first shot to strike Kennedy. This photo was taken in 1977,soon after the tree was trimmed back to its 1963 configuration for a televisiondocumentary. Today, no one can see this view because the window area has beenclosed off to the public with Plexiglass by the Sixth Floor Museum.Photo by Jim MarrsDISAPPEARING EVIDENCE—Here is one of a series of photos published by Dallaspolice chief Jesse Curry in 1967.

Foster watch as a sandy-haired man identified by Curry as an FBIagent picks something from the grass on the south side of Elm Street immediatelyfollowing the assassination. It was at this location that witnesses, includingFoster, claimed a bullet struck the ground near a manhole cover. This extraneousbullet was depicted in a news photograph published the next day. However, oncetaken away, there was no acknowledgement or even mention of this vital evidence.TWO SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS—Two of the most suspicious men in Dealey Plaza at thetime of the assassination were a man brandishing an open umbrella despite thewarm, balmy day and a dark-complected man with a bulge in his jacket.[images/graphics12.jpg]TWO SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS—Two of the most suspicious men in Dealey Plaza at thetime of the assassination were a man brandishing an open umbrella despite thewarm, balmy day and a dark-complected man with a bulge in his jacket. Althoughthese men arrived and left separately, in the moments after the shooting theysat together on the Elm Street curb. While the umbrella lies at the man’s feet,in other photos the dark-complected man appears to be speaking into awalkie-talkie. For nearly twenty years the federal government failed to identifythese men and made no mention of them in official reports. Belatedly, the“umbrella man” was identified as a Louie Steven Witt by the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations. However, Witt’s account did not correspond with theactions of the man depicted in assassination photos and many researchers haverejected him as a legitimate witness.EVIDENCE ODDITIES—Oswald carried a draft card with his picture but in the nameof Alek James Hidell. [images/graphics13.jpg]EVIDENCE ODDITIES—Oswald carried a draft card with his picture but in the nameof Alek James Hidell. No Selective Service card in 1963 carried a photograph,which led researchers to suspect that this card was fabricated by Oswaldhimself. When the police demanded to know if he was Oswald or Hidell, Oswald wasuncooperative. Yet at this same time—only two hours after the assassination—FBIdirector J. Edgar Hoover was already presenting a full background on Oswald’sMarine service and attempted defection to Russia, declaring him a “mean-mindedindividual…in the category of a nut.” How could Hoover have known more than theDallas authorities, who were uncertain of their suspect’s identity?THREE TRAMPS?—These three men were arrested in a railroad car a short time afterthe shooting and were marched through Dealey Plaza under armed guard.[images/graphics14.jpg]THREE TRAMPS?—These three men were arrested in a railroad car a short time afterthe shooting and were marched through Dealey Plaza under armed guard. For nearlythirty years their identities were unknown and no arrest records were found. Butin 1992, when Dallas police opened their assassination files, three arrestreports listing three men were found, all written in the same hand and on thesame date. Two of the men were located and they acknowledged being arrested onNovember 22, 1963. But the sudden appearance of the reports along with timingproblems led many researchers to question whether the men in the photos were thesame as the three tramps depicted in the arrest reports.MOVING SANDBAGS—In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations recreatedthe JFK assassination gunshots in Dealey Plaza as part of acoustical studiesthat ultimately led to its official conclusion that more than one gunman firedon the president. [images/graphics15.jpg]MOVING SANDBAGS—In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations recreatedthe JFK assassination gunshots in Dealey Plaza as part of acoustical studiesthat ultimately led to its official conclusion that more than one gunman firedon the president. Notice that just below the light-colored van a pile ofsandbags had been placed near the south curb of Elm Street. A sharpshooter onthe Depository’s sixth floor, using live ammunition, had ordered the bags movedfrom the center lane of the street, the actual location of the first shots intoKennedy’s limousine. The police shooting expert said he ordered the move becausehe could not gain an unobstructed line of sight into the center of Elm becauseof an intervening live oak tree. The same problem existed in 1963. Two yearsbefore this test, the tree had been trimmed back to its 1963 configuration forthe filming of a television documentary on the assassination. Neither thesharpshooter nor Oswald could have sighted a target in the center lane throughthe tree.Photo copyright 1979 by Tom BlackwellPATH OF THE MAGIC BULLET—The federal government’s official “lone-assassin”theory rests on the idea that a single bullet, acting in the manner as seen inthis diagram, caused seven wounds to two men, emerged in a “pristine” condition,and was fortuitously found on a stretcher in Parkland Hospital.[images/graphics16.jpg]PATH OF THE MAGIC BULLET—The federal government’s official “lone-assassin”theory rests on the idea that a single bullet, acting in the manner as seen inthis diagram, caused seven wounds to two men, emerged in a “pristine” condition,and was fortuitously found on a stretcher in Parkland Hospital. In detail, thistheory states that a rifle slug fired from sixty feet above ground level struckKennedy in the back, at the level of the third thoracic vertebra, at a downwardangle. Without hitting any bone, it coursed upwards to exit from his Adam’sapple, then turned downward again to strike Connally near his right armpit,shattering his fifth rib. It then exited near Connally’s right nipple andsomehow struck and shattered his right wrist before turning left and lodging inhis left thigh.BULLET HOLES IN JACKET AND SHIRT—Adding confirmation to the fact that Kennedywas never shot through the neck but in the back is the bullet hole in his bloodyjacket, which is still available for viewing in the National Archives.[images/graphics17.jpg][images/graphics18.jpg]BULLET HOLES IN JACKET AND SHIRT—Adding confirmation to the fact that Kennedywas never shot through the neck but in the back is the bullet hole in his bloodyjacket, which is still available for viewing in the National Archives. It hasbeen argued that Kennedy’s jacket bunched as he raised his arm to wave at thecrowd, causing the bullet hole in the jacket to be much lower than the actualwound in his body. However, the bullet hole in his shirt also indicates that theshot from the rear was in the back rather than the neck. One’s shirt does notbunch up when waving.A COMPOSITE PHOTOGRAPH—When shown the famous photos depicting Oswald in hisbackyard with weapons and a communist publication, Oswald stated they werecomposite pictures with his face pasted on another’s body.[images/graphics19.jpg]A COMPOSITE PHOTOGRAPH—When shown the famous photos depicting Oswald in hisbackyard with weapons and a communist publication, Oswald stated they werecomposite pictures with his face pasted on another’s body. Proof of hisstatement came when graphics expert Jack White made the two known photos(Commission Exhibits 133 A and B) into transparencies and overlaid them. Nothingin the two separate pictures matched exactly, except Oswald’s face. To createsuch a match with a handheld camera is impossible. Only a slight discrepancy wasfound on his mouth, apparently the result of later retouching. A third backyardphoto turned up fifteen years after the assassination in the hands of Dallaspoliceman Roscoe White’s widow. There was no chain of evidence or explanationfor this photo. Yet when investigators recreated the backyard pose for theWarren Commission, they chose the pose of the third photo, proving suppressionof evidence. Again, Oswald’s face matched perfectly.A CHIN TRANSPLANT—It is clear that the figure in the incriminating Oswaldbackyard photo has a broad flat chin. [images/graphics20.jpg]A CHIN TRANSPLANT—It is clear that the figure in the incriminating Oswaldbackyard photo has a broad flat chin. However, as seen in Oswald’s Dallas policephoto, he had a pointed, cleft chin. In the backyard photos, a perceptible linebreaking the emulsion of the picture can be seen stretching from one side of theneck to the other. If Oswald was correct in stating that his face was pastedonto another’s body, it would have been above the line across the chin.Photoanalysis by Jack WhiteFRAGMENTS IN CONNALLY’S WRIST—The X-ray of Texas governor John Connally’s rightwrist shows bright spots, which are metal fragments from the bullet thatshattered his radius, the largest and thickest of the wrist bones.[images/graphics21.jpg]FRAGMENTS IN CONNALLY’S WRIST—The X-ray of Texas governor John Connally’s rightwrist shows bright spots, which are metal fragments from the bullet thatshattered his radius, the largest and thickest of the wrist bones.

In accordance withits “lone-assassin” theory, this inventory of assassination evidence shows thatthree spent 6.5 mm shell casings were recovered from the sixth floor of theTexas School Book Depository. The bottom of the sheet is clear. However, as canbe seen on the evidence sheet from the Dallas police files, only two spent shellcasings were found and logged. A Dallas police official belatedly turned over athird shell casing. He said he forgot he carried it around in his pocket forseveral days. At the bottom of the actual evidence sheet it states that theparaffin test on Oswald showed “positive on both hands and negative on face.”However, though the paraffin report itself showed traces of nitrates on Oswald’shands, it showed no gunpowder on his hand or face—evidence that he did not firea rifle that day. The Warren Commission concluded the paraffin test wasunreliable but instead of explaining this, they chose to delete reference to thetest on the evidence sheet, an explicit example of alteration and suppression ofevidence.A COMPOSITE OSWALD—The Warren Commission published this picture of Lee HarveyOswald (Commission Exhibit 2963), reportedly taken about the time of hisattempted defection to Russia. [images/graphics25.jpg]A COMPOSITE OSWALD—The Warren Commission published this picture of Lee HarveyOswald (Commission Exhibit 2963), reportedly taken about the time of hisattempted defection to Russia. According to some researchers, this is acomposite picture of two separate individuals—Lee Oswald on the left and HarveyOswald on the right. Retouching can be seen on the lips and eyebrow. Also,although there is a light source from the person’s right, his shadow on the rearwall falls to the left. An obvious line separating the two faces can be drawnfrom a break in the hairline at the top of his head through his mouth and chinand on through his necktie. Such composite photos have been used by intelligenceagencies to allow an operative to pass cursory official examination whenimpersonating a similar-looking person. Adding to the evidence that Oswald wasimpersonated at various times are a memo from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover threeyears before the assassination, warning that an imposter was using the birthcertificate of Lee Harvey Oswald, and a letter to the Russian embassy datedNovember 9, 1963, and signed by Lee Harvey Oswald, stating that he could notobtain a new Mexico visa “without using my real name.” There are a number ofaccounts of Oswald’s being seen in widely separated locations at the same time.When brought to same size, the Marine Oswald (left) appears to be taller thanthe Russian Oswald (right).Photoanalysis by Jack WhiteDEAR MR.

HUNT—This handwritten note, dated November 8, 1963, and signed “LeeHarvey Oswald,” is addressed to a “Mr. Hunt,” requesting “information concerding[sic] my position.” The handwriting has been authenticated as that of Oswald.Some researchers believe the note was meant for Dallas oilman H. L. Hunt, whowas open about his hatred of Kennedy. However, the fact that the note originatedin Mexico City has lead other researchers to suspect the addressee may have beenWatergate scandal figure E. Howard Hunt, a CIA officer working with anti-CastroCubans in 1963. By some accounts, Hunt was in Mexico City at the time the notewas written and some, including his son, St. John Hunt, have placed him inphotographs taken in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. In a dyingdeclaration, the elder Hunt named the chief assassination conspirators as LyndonJohnson, Cord Meyer and William Harvey of the CIA, operative David Morales, anda French assassin.UNDERCOVER WORK—Tantalizing evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald participated inintelligence work is reflected in this Marine medical record dated September 16,1958. [images/graphics28.jpg]UNDERCOVER WORK—Tantalizing evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald participated inintelligence work is reflected in this Marine medical record dated September 16,1958. Every branch of the US military cautions troops against contractingvenereal disease. Some units, such as the Marine Corps, punish members who aretreated for such disease. Yet, Oswald’s military record indicates that his caseof gonorrhea was contracted “In line of duty, Not due to own misconduct.” Thisastonishing statement indicates that Marine Oswald may have been recruited intointelligence work while serving in Japan and ordered to consort with prostitutessuspected as foreign agents."},{"pageContent":"PART III [Contents.html#rpa3][images/f0303-01.jpg]AFTERMATH [Contents.html#rpa3]"},{"pageContent":"Dallas [Contents.html#rch11]The gunfire had barely died away in Dealey Plaza when an aftermath of odd andoften unexplained events began in Dallas—and has continued for decades, acircumstance well beyond the means of any lone assassin.Dallas police blocking the nearby intersections with no orders to thecontrary—recall the eight-minute disruption of the Dallas police radio motorcadechannel during the time of the shooting—released traffic, which began pouringthrough the crime scene.Spectators from blocks away, having heard the shots and sirens, ran to thescene. Some bystanders were in shock. Others were shouting, “They shot thepresident!” while others sobbed out the news. Pandemonium was the order of theday.There was no shortage of lawmen as nearly twenty sheriff’s deputies, followingsheriff Bill Decker’s orders, ran to the railroad yards behind the Grassy Knoll.Dozens of Dallas police officers also were flooding the area. But all werereceiving conflicting information—witnesses on the west end of Dealey Plazapinpointed the picket fence on the Grassy Knoll as the source of the shots,while many people on the east end said shots came from the vicinity of the TexasSchool Book Depository.It is significant to recall that James Tague, who was slightly wounded when abullet or bullet fragment struck the Main Street curb near the Triple Underpass,last spoke with deputy sheriff Buddy Walthers before having to move his car oncetraffic got moving. Tague said this occurred about 12:40 p.m.Yet Walthers was among the first officers to seal off the Depository, indicatingthat the building was still open for at least ten minutes after the shooting.Actually the time may have been much longer. Captain Will Fritz, who headed theDallas police investigation, told the Warren Commission he began making detailednotes after hearing of the assassination at the Trade Mart. Fritz said hearrived at the Texas School Book Depository at exactly 12:58 p.m. Asked if theDepository exits were guarded at that time, Fritz replied, “I am not sure, but Idon’t—there had been some question about that, but the reason I don’t thinkthat—this may differ with someone else, but I am going to tell you what I know.. . . After I arrived, one of the officers asked me if I would like to have thebuilding sealed and I told him I would.”Recall that witness Ed Hoffman was able to drive from Stemmons Freeway to therailroad yards behind the Depository, circle the area, and leave unchallenged.The point is that there was no effective containment of the crime scene or ofthe Depository for at least ten minutes—and perhaps as much as twenty-eightminutes—after the shooting.Officially it has been claimed that within an hour of the assassination, therewas a roll call at the Texas School Book Depository. Employee Lee Harvey Oswaldwas the only person missing and authorities immediately began a search for him.Like so much other information in this case, this story is simply untrue.To begin with, most Depository employees were outside viewing the motorcade atthe time of the shooting and were prevented from returning to work by police.During the first roll call, dozens of Depository employees were missing. By thetime it was determined that Oswald was gone—about 2:30 p.m.—he was already inpolice custody.This was confirmed in 1981 by Dallas Morning News reporter Kent Biffle, whorecalled that day in a lengthy article based on his notes of that day:Only two of us [reporters] had arrived at the ambush building [the Depository]by this point. . . . Getting in was no problem. I just hid my press badge . . .and went in with the first wave of cops. . . . Hours dragged by. The buildingsuperintendent showed up with some papers in his hand. I listened as he tolddetectives about Lee Oswald failing to show up at a roll call. My impression isthat there was an earlier roll call that had been inconclusive because severalemployees were missing. This time, however, all were accounted for exceptOswald. I jotted down the Oswald information. . . . Neither the police in thebuilding nor the superintendent knew that Oswald already was under arrest.In the confusion following the assassination, there was ample opportunity forconspirators to escape and for vital evidence to be eliminated.One such incident occurred minutes after the shooting on the south side of ElmStreet. Dallas policeman J. W. Foster, from his vantage point on top of theTriple Underpass, saw a bullet strike the grass on the south side of Elm near amanhole cover. He reported this to a superior officer and was told to guard thearea. Photographs taken that day show both Foster and Deputy Sheriff Walthersstanding over the manhole cover.News reporters and spectators were kept at a distance and told that evidence—abullet—was embedded in the grass inches from the manhole cover. News cameramanHarry Cabluck photographed the scene and recalled seeing more than one gouge inthe ground. He, too, was told that a bullet had struck there. One photograph ofthe slug even appeared in the November 23, 1963, edition of the Fort WorthStar-Telegram, with the caption:ASSASSIN’S BULLET: One of the rifle bullets fired by the murderer of PresidentKennedy lies in the grass across Elm Street from the building in which thekiller was hiding and from where he launched his assault.Inches from the bullet, which is circled in the newspaper photo, is the edge ofthe cement manhole.Other witnesses to the bullet marks on the south side of Elm Street were Wayneand Edna Hartman, who were in Dallas for jury duty. After hearing shots inDealey Plaza, the couple “ran like the devil” down to the grassy middle area ofthe plaza. Mrs. Hartman told this author:There were not many people in this area at the time, but a policeman was there.He pointed to some bushes near the railroad tracks on the north side of thestreet and said that’s where the shots came from. . . . Then I noticed these twoparallel marks on the ground that looked like mounds made by a mole. I asked“What are these, mole hills?” and the policeman said, “Oh no, ma’am, that’swhere the bullets struck the ground.”On Sunday, the Hartmans again visited Dealey Plaza but found that the crush ofpeople bringing memorials had obliterated the marks.In the summer of 1964, the Hartmans contacted the FBI after learning that thebureau was still seeking assassination information. Mrs. Hartman said FBI agentsdidn’t seem too interested in what they had to say. One agent told them themarks had been made by bone fragments from Kennedy’s head, an explanation thatsounded “strange” to the Hartmans.Both Hartmans told the FBI that the bullet marks did not line up with the TexasSchool Book Depository but rather with the picket fence on the Grassy Knoll.Years later, Mrs. Hartman recalled:I don’t see how what we saw down there could have come from those windows upthere because they were not the right angle. So we have always felt that it camefrom across the street . . . that was the angle . . . across the street fromwhere we stood . . . the Grassy Knoll, we’ve always felt it came from there. . .. And at that time people were telling us the bullets came from over there.There was somebody over there shooting also. And they pointed across the street,which was south of the Depository.Yet in an FBI report dated July 10, 1964, agents stated, “[The Hartmans] saidthis gouged out hole was in line with the general area of the Texas School BookDepository Building. [They] said some bystander had mentioned that he believedthe shots had come from the Texas School Book Depository Building.”If one or more bullet slugs were in the grass, what happened to them? What roledid an extra slug play in the assassination? Was the erroneous FBI report amistake or was it meant to pinpoint the Depository as the assassin’s lair? Wasthe slug in the grass proof that at least four shots were fired? The answers tothese questions may never be known because, officially, this bullet neverexisted.Within minutes of the shooting, a sandy-haired man in a suit appeared—identifiedin Dallas police chief Jesse Curry’s book as an FBI agent. This man apparentlyhad some authority, for in full view of both Walthers and Foster, he walked up,reached down, cupped some object in his hand, and stuck it into his left pantspocket.The bullet was gone.Later in 1964, when reports of this bullet reached the Warren Commission, theFBI was instructed to investigate the matter. Agents reported back that they hadexamined the manhole cover and there was no sign of a bullet striking it. Therewas no mention of the fact that the bullet in question landed inches away fromthe manhole cover. Apparently satisfied, the Commission dropped the matter ofthe bullet in the grass.Later on the day of the assassination, the Stemmons Freeway sign, whichaccording to some bystanders was struck by a bullet, disappeared. It is missingin photographs made in Dealey Plaza the next day. No official explanation ofthis disappearance has been offered, although some Dallasites recalled a brieflocal news segment at the time explaining that the sign was taken down by thecity because a bullet hole in it would remind the public of the assassination.In 2004 the Asahi Television Network of Japan procured two separate copies ofthe Zapruder film, both of which contained approximately six frames missing fromthe copies shown around the world to the public. Life magazine officialsexplained the missing frames were due to processing damage. In the missingframes it is apparent that a small hole appears in the Stemmons sign at the timeof the shooting. Computer experts in England and Poland confirmed this as abullet hole.In 1974, Richard Lester, using a metal detector, discovered a bullet fragment onthe far south side of Dealey Plaza just east of the Triple Underpass. Two yearslater, Lester turned the fragment over to the FBI. It was later studied byfirearms experts of the House Select Committee on Assassinations who determinedthrough ballistics that while the fragment was from 6.5-millimeter ammunition,it had not been fired through the Oswald rifle. Rather than view this asevidence that perhaps multiple rifles were used in the assassination, both theFBI and the committee left the impression that this discovery had no connectionwith Kennedy’s death.An intact .45-caliber bullet was discovered in May 1976 by Hal Luster buried indirt by the four-foot-high cement retaining wall near where Abraham Zapruder hadstood filming.Yet another story of a found shell casing may shed much light on how some bulletfragments were traced to the Oswald rifle.Dean Morgan of Lewisville, a suburb of Dallas, related that in 1975 his fatherwas working on air-conditioning equipment on the roof of the Dallas CountyRecords Building, located just catercornered from the Texas School BookDepository. The Records Building’s west side faces onto Dealey Plaza and thereis a waist-high parapet along the edge of its roof.According to Morgan, his father, while searching for water leaks, discovered a30.06-caliber shell casing lying under a lip of roofing tar at the base of theroof’s parapet on the side facing Dealey Plaza.The shell casing is dated 1953 and marks indicate it was manufactured at theTwin Cities Arsenal. One side was pitted by exposure to the weather, indicatingit had lain on the roof for a long time. The casing, which remains in Morgan’spossession, has an odd crimp around its neck.Rifle experts have explained to Morgan that this is evidence that a sabot mayhave been used to fire ammunition from a 30.06 rifle. A sabot, also called ahusk, is a plastic sleeve that allows a larger-caliber weapon to fire asmaller-caliber slug. The results of using a lighter-weight slug includeincreased velocity, producing more accuracy and greater striking power. And thesmaller slug exhibits the ballistics of the weapon it was originally fired from,rather than, in this case, the 30.06, as the sabot engages the 30.06’s rifling.In other words, assassination conspirators could have fired 6.5-millimeterbullets from the Oswald rifle into water, recovered them, then reloaded theminto the more accurate and powerful 30.06 with the use of a sabot—which is heldin place by crimping the cartridge.By this method, bullet fragments found in the presidential limousine would havethe ballistics of Oswald’s rifle rather than the 30.06 from which they wereactually fired.Warren Commission Exhibit 399—the nearly intact slug found at Parkland Hospitalthe afternoon of the assassination—displays all the characteristics of a slugfired into nothing more solid than water. It is just such a slug that can bereloaded and refired using a sabot, which comes apart on firing.That such technology was available in 1963 is proven by a February 1962 ad inGuns magazine offering “Husk Bullets,” and depicting a .22-caliber slug seatedin a .308-caliber shell casing.One such plastic sabot reportedly was found in Dealey Plaza the afternoon of theassassination by a member of the anticommunist Minutemen organization, led byMissouri biochemist Robert DePugh, who related the story to talk-show host StanMajor in the early 1990s. He claimed that a few months after he received thesabot, the FBI raided his home and took all his possessions. Eventually it wasall returned, except for the plastic sleeve. DePugh died in 2009.Bullets and a plastic sleeve were not the only evidence found in Dealey Plaza.The day after the assassination, a college student named Billy Harper was takingpictures in the plaza when he found a piece of skull about twenty-five feetbehind and to the left of the president’s limo at the time of the head shot.Personnel at Methodist Hospital identified it as a piece from the occipitalregion at the right rear of the head. It, too, was never acknowledged by theWarren Commission.And while evidence was disappearing from Elm Street, men were seen fleeing therear of the Texas School Book Depository.Richard Carr, a steelworker who saw a heavyset man on the sixth floor of theDepository minutes before the shooting, saw two men run either from inside orfrom behind the Texas School Book Depository minutes after the assassination.Carr claimed the men got into a Nash Rambler station wagon on Houston Street bythe east side of the Depository. He said the wagon left in such a hurry one ofits doors was still open. He last saw the station wagon speeding north onHouston. Did it return moments later to pick up the Oswald figure as reported byDeputy Sheriff Craig?After reaching ground level from his seventh-story vantage point on thecourthouse under construction, Carr said he saw the same man he had seen earlierin the Depository window. Carr said the man was “in an extreme hurry and keptlooking over his shoulder” as he walked hurriedly eastward on Commerce Street.Carr’s story was corroborated by that of James R. Worrell Jr., then atwenty-year-old high school senior who told the Warren Commission that secondsafter the shooting, he saw a man wearing a sports coat come out of the rear ofthe Depository and walk briskly south on Houston (the direction of Carr’slocation). Worrell can’t be questioned further about what he saw, as he waskilled in a motorcycle accident on November 9, 1966, at age twenty-three. Carr,however, told researchers about his treatment at the hands of the authorities.In a taped interview, Carr said:The FBI came to my house—there were two of them—and they said they heard Iwitnessed the assassination and I said I did. They told me, “If you didn’t seeLee Harvey Oswald up in the School Book Depository with a rifle, you didn’twitness it.” I said, “Well, the man I saw on television that they tell me is LeeHarvey Oswald was not in the window of the School Book Depository. That’s notthe man.” And [one of the agents] said I better keep my mouth shut. He did notask me what I saw, he told me what I saw.Not long after this encounter with the FBI, Carr’s home was raided by more thana dozen Dallas policemen and detectives armed with a search warrant. Claimingthey were looking for “stolen articles,” they ransacked Carr’s home whileholding him and his wife at gunpoint. Carr and his wife were taken to jail butlater released. The day after the police raid, Carr received an anonymous phonecall advising him to “get out of Texas.”Carr finally moved to Montana to avoid harassment, but there he found dynamitein his car on one occasion and was shot at on another.After testifying in the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans, Carr was attacked by twomen in Atlanta. Although stabbed in the back and left arm, Carr managed tofatally shoot one of his assailants. After turning himself in, Carr was notindicted by an Atlanta grand jury.Carr was not the only assassination witness to later claim they were victims ofa pattern of intimidation. Acquilla Clemons, who saw two men at the scene of theTippit slaying, said a man with a gun came to her home and told her to keepquiet. Ed Hoffman, who saw two men with a rifle behind the picket fence on theGrassy Knoll at the time of the assassination, was warned by an FBI agent not totell what he saw “or you might get killed.”A relative of Depository superintendent Roy Truly recently told researchers thatdue to intimidation by federal authorities, Truly was fearful until his death.Truly’s wife, Mildred, refused to discuss the assassination—even with familymembers.Sandy Speaker, the supervisor of Warren Commission star witness Howard Brennan,would not discuss the assassination until recently, after getting a phone callfrom his friend and coworker A. J. Millican. Speaker said he got a call fromMillican early in 1964. Millican was almost in tears and told him never to talkabout the assassination. Millican said he had just received an anonymous callthreatening not only his life, but the lives of his wife and her sister. He saidthe caller told him to warn Speaker to keep his mouth shut.Speaker told this author:That call really shook me up because Millican was a former boxing champ of thePacific fleet. He was a scrapper, a fighter. But he was obviously scared todeath. I also got a call. And I still don’t understand how they got my namebecause I was never interviewed by the FBI, the Secret Service, the police oranyone. They must be pretty powerful to have found out about me.Whispered rumors, anonymous phone calls, and freakish “accidents” combined tocreate a tangible aura of fear in Dallas in the weeks following theassassination. Some of that fear lingered for decades.Mysterious Secret Service Men [Contents.html#rsec64]One of the most puzzling aspects of the post-assassination confusion involvedencounters between Dealey Plaza witnesses and “Secret Service” agents.The most notable incident was recounted by Dallas policeman Joe M. Smith. Smithhad run into the parking lot atop the Grassy Knoll after a woman had told him,“They’re shooting the president from the bushes!” While searching through theparked cars, he encountered a man who displayed Secret Service identification.Smith told author Anthony Summers:The man, this character, produces credentials from his hip pocket which showedhim to be Secret Service. I have seen those credentials before, and theysatisfied me. . . . So, I immediately accepted that and let him go and continuedour search around the cars.Malcolm Summers was one of the bystanders who followed police up the GrassyKnoll immediately after the shooting. He said:I ran across Elm Street to run up there toward that knoll. And we were stoppedby a man in a suit and he had an overcoat over his arm. I saw a gun under thatovercoat. And his comment was, “Don’t y’all come up here any further, you couldget shot . . . or killed.”The Secret Service subsequently asserted that none of their agents on duty thatday were anywhere near Dealey Plaza either before or just after theassassination. All were either riding in the motorcade or at the Trade Mart.In retrospect, Smith doubted the legitimacy of the man he encountered. In 1963,Secret Service agents, like their FBI counterparts, wore crew cuts, dark suits,and narrow ties.Smith described the man thusly:He looked like an auto mechanic. He had on a sports shirt and sports pants. Buthe had dirty fingernails, it looked like, and hands that looked like automechanic’s hands. And, afterwards, it didn’t ring true for the Secret Service. .. . At the time we were so pressed for time and we were searching. And he hadproduced correct identification and we just overlooked the thing. I should havechecked the man closer, but at the time, I didn’t snap on it.In addition to Smith and Summers, GI Gordon Arnold also encountered a man whoclaimed to be with the Secret Service just moments before the assassination.Arnold said he was walking behind the wooden picket fence on top of the GrassyKnoll when he was approached by a man who told him he was with the SecretService and that Arnold could not stay behind the fence. Moments later, Arnoldsaid shots came from behind the fence.Sam Holland, who was standing with two Dallas policemen and other railroadworkers on the Triple Underpass, told the Warren Commission that “a plainclothesdetective or FBI agent or something like that” was helping the police guard therailroad bridge. Holland told a Commission attorney, “There were two citypolicemen and one man in plainclothes. I didn’t talk to him. I talked to thecity policemen.”Holland said after hearing shots and seeing a white puff of smoke come frombehind the wooden picket fence, he and others ran to the Grassy Knoll. He latersaid that while they found no one behind the picket fence, “somebody had beenstanding there for a long period. I guess if you could count them, about ahundred foot tracks [were] in that little spot, and also mud on the bumper of[a] station wagon.”Constable Seymour Weitzman, who had rushed behind the picket fence, met men hebelieved were Secret Service. Warren Commission lawyer Joseph Ball askedWeitzman if there were others with him behind the fence. Weitzman replied:Yes sir; other officers, Secret Service as well, and somebody started, there wassomething red in the street and I went back over the wall and somebody broughtme a piece of what he thought to be a firecracker and it turned out to be, Ibelieve, I wouldn’t quote this, but I turned it over to one of the SecretService men and I told them it should go to the lab because it looked to me likehuman bone. I later found out it was supposedly a portion of the President’sskull.It is not certain whether the proper authorities ever investigated thisparticular piece of bone. There is no mention of it in official reports,although Commission Document 1269 is titled “Location of Photos of a BoneSpecimen.” This document, however, is still classified.Dallas police sergeant D. V. Harkness also encountered Secret Service men wherenone officially were supposed to be. Harkness told the Warren Commission that heran to the rear of the Texas School Book Depository moments after the shootingand “there were some Secret Service agents there.” Harkness told a commissionlawyer, “Didn’t get them identified. They told me they are Secret Service.”In later years Harkness told the Dallas Morning News that the men were dressedin suits and “were all armed.” He told the newspaper, “[I] assumed they werewith the Presidential party.”Dallas Secret Service agent in charge Forrest V. Sorrels was the only SecretService agent to return to the scene of the assassination within an hour or so.Sorrels said he walked through a rear door of the Texas School Book Depositorywithout showing any identification. His arrival was too late to have been thatof one of the men Harkness encountered.In 1978 Sorrels, then retired, was asked by a Dallas newsman to comment on thestories of bogus Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza. Sorrels said, “[I’m] notanswering any questions about this thing. I gave all my testimony in Washingtonand I don’t put out anything else. As far as I’m concerned, that’s a closedincident.”Another odd incident involving Secret Service agents who may have been bogusoccurred within an hour of the assassination in the small town of Ferris,located just south of Dallas. Two high school students, Billy V. James andRonnie Witherspoon, witnessed a speeding car being stopped by local police onInterstate 45. The students stopped to watch because they thought “we may havebeen witnessing the arrest of the assassins.” However, according to thestudents, the men in the stopped car told police they were Secret Service agents“in a hurry to get to New Orleans to investigate something in connection withthe assassination.” James said the police believed the men and allowed them togo on without being ticketed. No Secret Service agent reported leaving Dallasfor New Orleans that day and the identity of the men in the car remains amystery.Incredibly, even the accused assassin apparently had an encounter with one ofthese bogus agents.Secret Service inspector Thomas J. Kelley was one of several officials whointerrogated Lee Harvey Oswald on the Sunday morning he was shot by Ruby. In hisreport of that interview, Kelley wrote:[Oswald] asked me whether I was an FBI agent and I said that I was not, that Iwas a member of the Secret Service. He said when he was standing in front of theTextbook Building [Texas School Book Depository] and about to leave it, a young,crew-cut man rushed up to him and said he was from the Secret Service, showed abook of identification, and asked him where the phone was. Oswald said hepointed toward the pay phone in the building and that he saw the man actually goto the phone before he left.It is significant that Oswald mentioned a “book of identification,” as thisaccurately described the folding leather badge holder used by government agents.In later years, the theory was advanced that Oswald had merely mistaken a newsreporter for an agent. Kelley’s report dispels this notion, as news reportersmerely carried press cards.In fact, when the sixth-floor museum of the assassination opened in 1989, ataped tour of the exhibit was narrated by newsman Pierce Allman, who claimed tohave been the reporter Oswald encountered. Amazingly, two other newsmen, RobertMcNeil and Bill Moyers, also said they were told after the assassination thatwhile looking for a telephone they had encountered Lee Oswald. Apparently noneof these newsmen had any direct memory of this incident but said governmentagents planted the story in their mind by telling them months after theassassination they had encountered the accused assassin.It seems incredible that the suspected killer of the president not only took thetime to help someone he believed to be a Secret Service agent, but then stoodaround to watch him get to the telephone. It is claimed that less than an hourlater, Oswald shot down a Dallas policeman who merely stopped him far fromdowntown in South Oak Cliff.Considering the number of people claiming to have encountered agents in DealeyPlaza, it appears that Oswald may well have been correct in his identificationof a Secret Service agent or someone posing as one.But perhaps the strangest—and most ominous—incident involving the Secret Servicehappened to witness Jean Hill, who was standing beside her friend Mary Moormanon the south side of Elm Street at the moment Kennedy was killed. Moorman fellto the ground at the sound of the shooting, but Hill remained standing andwatchful.After seeing both a man fire from behind the wooden picket fence and asuspicious man rapidly walking west in front of the Depository, Hill ran acrossElm Street and began to run up the Grassy Knoll. Hill told this author, “I don’tknow what I would have done if I had caught them, but I knew something terriblehad happened and somebody had to do something.”As she ran up the Grassy Knoll, her attention was drawn to a “trail of blood inthe grass just to the right of the steps.” Thinking that “our guys had shot backand we got one of them,” she followed the red droplets until she discovered theybelonged to a snow cone—flavored ice packed in a cup. Someone had dropped ared-colored one that day on the Grassy Knoll.After the distraction of the snow cone, Hill continued her run up the GrassyKnoll, but had wasted valuable seconds. She looked in vain for either thesuspicious man behind the fence or the man she saw by the Depository. Sherecalled, “All I saw in that parking area were railroad workers and police.”Walking to the west of the Texas School Book Depository, Hill said, sheencountered two men who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. She toldinterviewers in Texas:I was looking around but I couldn’t see anything, when these two guys came upbehind me. One of them said, “You’re coming with us,” and I replied, “Oh, no I’mnot. I don’t know you.” “I said you’re coming with us,” one of them said andthen put this horrible grip on my shoulder. I can still feel the pain when Ithink about it. I tried to tell them, “I have to go back and find my friendMary.” But then the other guy put a grip on my other shoulder and they beganhustling me past the front of the Depository. “Keep smiling and keep walking,”one of them kept telling me. They marched me across the plaza and into abuilding. We entered from the south side and I think it was the sheriff’soffice. They took me to a little office upstairs and they wouldn’t let me out ofthis room. It was all such a shock. There was a lot of tension and it was like alot of it was focused on this one area. The two men that grabbed me never showedme any identification but, after we got to this little room, some men came inwho were Secret Service. They began to ask me a lot of questions. One man toldme they had been watching Mary and I out of the window. He asked me, “Did yousee a bullet hit at your feet?” I told him I didn’t realize that one had strucknear my feet. “Then, why did you jump back up on the curb?” he asked me and Itold him how I had started to run at the President’s car but thought better ofit. Then I heard some booming sounds and it startled me and I jumped back on thecurb by Mary. I guess they were up there the whole time and watched the wholething. Then they sent those two guys to come and get me. I mean, I wasn’t toohard to find that day—wearing that red raincoat.Hill said she was kept in the room for some time before rejoining Mary Moormanin a downstairs office. There were other assassination witnesses in the office,such as Charles Brehm and others who signed sheriff’s depositions that day.A Dallas newspaperman Moorman and Hill initially believed to be a federal agenttook all of the photographs Moorman had taken of the motorcade. Later that daythree of the six snapshots were returned, and federal authorities returned therest, but only after several weeks. The backgrounds on two of the returnedphotographs were mutilated.Dallas police chief Jesse Curry summed up the import of a man with SecretService identification when he told author Anthony Summers:Certainly the suspicion would point to the man as being involved, some way orother, in the shooting, since he was in the area immediately adjacent to wherethe shots were—and the fact that he had a badge that purported him to be SecretService would make it seem all the more suspicious.The House Select Committee on Assassinations briefly looked into the matter ofmen with Secret Service identification but came up with no real solution.After establishing that “Except for Dallas Agent-in-Charge Sorrels, who helpedpolice search the Texas School Book Depository, no [Secret Service] agent was inthe vicinity of the stockade fence or inside the book depository on the day ofthe assassination,” the committee wrote off most of the sightings as peoplemistaking plainclothes police for agents.However, the committee could not dismiss Officer Smith’s story so lightly. FBIagent James Hosty, who was named in Oswald’s notebook and who destroyed Oswald’swarning note, told the committee that Smith may have encountered a treasuryagent named Frank Ellsworth. When deposed by the committee, Ellsworth denied theallegation.Despite its inability to determine who was carrying Secret Serviceidentification on the Grassy Knoll on November 22, 1963, the committeenevertheless concluded, “[We] found no evidence of Secret Service complicity inthe assassination.”However, if Jean Hill’s account is true, either men posing as federal agentswere using offices in the Dallas County sheriff’s building minutes after theassassination or genuine federal agents were monitoring the tragedy from anupper-story window.[images/line.jpg]One portion of Jean Hill’s account that seemed unbelievable was heridentification of the man she saw in front of the Depository as Jack Ruby.However, this story appears to have some corroboration.First, recall the story of Julia Ann Mercer, who identified a man sitting in atruck just west of the Triple Underpass about an hour before the assassinationas Jack Ruby. Also recall that both Mercer and Oswald’s mother, Marguerite, saidauthorities showed them photographs of Jack Ruby before Ruby killed Oswald.Then there is the Warren Commission testimony of Depository employee VictoriaAdams, who said she and a coworker saw a man at the intersection of Elm andHouston minutes after the assassination “questioning people as if he were apolice officer.” She told the Commission that the man “looked very similar” tothe photos of Jack Ruby broadcast after the Oswald slaying. Her companion, AveryDavis, was never asked for her opinion.Malcolm O. Couch, a television cameraman for WFAA-TV in Dallas, also supportedthe idea that Ruby was in Dealey Plaza when he told the Warren Commission thatanother newsman, Wes Wise (who later became mayor of Dallas), had seen Rubywalking around the side of the Texas School Book Depository moments after theshooting. However, Couch was forced to admit his story was just “hearsay” byCommission lawyers who then declined to call Wes Wise to clarify the issue.An FBI report from December 1963 gave the account of Lucy Lopez, who had been inDallas visiting her daughter. They had joined others watching the motorcade froma window in the Dal-Tex Building when they recognized Jack Ruby walking back andforth outside the book depository. The women were acquainted with Ruby and alsoknew Oswald, who they recalled had once eaten with them at a nearby restaurant.Lopez told the FBI the women saw Ruby hand Oswald a pistol before walking offbut were afraid to talk to the authorities.Another story regarding Jack Ruby’s possible presence in Dealey Plaza comes fromPhil Willis, an amateur photographer and assassination witness. Willis, who knewJack Ruby by sight at the time of the assassination, still claims to have seenand photographed Ruby minutes after the shooting, standing near the front of theTexas School Book Depository.In publishing Willis’s series of assassination photos, the Warren Commissioncropped the face of the Ruby figure out of the picture.Was Jack Ruby at the scene of the assassination?The Warren Commission established that Ruby was in the offices of the DallasMorning News at the time of the shooting. The Commission stated that Rubyarrived at the newspaper between 11 and 11:30 a.m., some thirty minutes afterthe incident at the Triple Underpass involving Julia Ann Mercer.The Commission also determined that Ruby was with newspaper advertising employeeDon Campbell until Campbell left for lunch about 12:25 p.m. About 12:45 p.m.another advertising employee, John Newnam, reportedly saw Ruby in the same spotCampbell had left him. However, Newnam and other newspaper employees said onceword came that Kennedy had been shot (probably no sooner than 12:40 p.m., fromemployees who had been in Dealey Plaza returning to work), “confusion reigned”in the newspaper offices.Years later employee Wanda Walker still recalled vividly how Ruby sat quietly inthe near-empty newspaper office that noontime. Walker told researchers in 1986:The other secretary had gone to lunch and the ad salesmen were all gone and itwas just me and Ruby up there. He was waiting for his regular ad man. He did anodd thing. I knew who he was, but we had never talked. But he got up and cameover and sat by the desk where I was. It was like he didn’t want to be alone. Hesaid some things but I can’t tell you what they were. Then some people startedcoming back in and they said the President had been shot. Jack Ruby got white asa sheet. I mean he was really shaken up.Despite Walker’s certainty that Ruby remained at the newspaper office during thetime of the assassination, it is possible that Ruby could have slipped away fora few minutes.No one was keeping exact times, and the Dallas Morning News offices are only twoshort blocks from Dealey Plaza. It is conceivable that Ruby could have left thenewspaper offices, been in Dealey Plaza, and returned unnoticed within the spaceof ten or fifteen minutes.Ruby certainly was at Parkland Hospital after the assassination. In his 1978book, Who Was Jack Ruby?, newsman Seth Kantor reported meeting and talking withRuby at Parkland Hospital about 1:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963. This wassupported by radio newsman Roy Stamps, also an acquaintance of Ruby’s, who toldthis author he saw Ruby enter Parkland about 1:30 p.m. carrying some equipmentfor a television crew.According to the Warren Commission, Ruby “firmly denied going to Parkland” and“video tapes of the scene at Parkland do not show Ruby there,” and so theCommission concluded “Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital.”They failed to mention a photograph published by Penn Jones that appears todepict Ruby strolling through the crowd at Parkland Hospital.The House Select Committee on Assassinations reversed this conclusion, statingthat after reviewing the evidence concerning Ruby at Parkland Hospital an houror so after the assassination, the panel decided, “While the Warren Commissionconcluded Kantor was mistaken, the Committee determined he probably was not.”If Ruby lied and the Warren Commission erred by denying Ruby’s presence atParkland, it could explain the sudden and unexplained appearance of CommissionExhibit 399—the intact bullet slug found at Parkland—that led to thesingle-bullet theory. It is entirely possible that Ruby planted the bullet. Andit is possible that Ruby may have made his way—no matter how briefly—to thescene of the assassination.Jean Hill said she recognized the man who shot Oswald as being the same man shesaw “walking briskly” in front of the Texas School Book Depository seconds afterthe assassination. The man she saw was almost running west toward the TripleUnderpass. She lost sight of the man after reaching the top of the Grassy Knoll.This story may play a part in the account of one Dallas policeman who chased aman leaving the area of the Triple Underpass.The Black Car Chase [Contents.html#rsec65]On November 22, 1963, Dallas policeman Tom G. Tilson Jr. had taken the day off.A friend and fellow policeman, J. D. Tippit, was covering Tilson’s regular beatthat day. Three days later Tilson was a pallbearer at Tippit’s funeral.Tilson told Dallas news reporters of chasing a black car from the scene of theassassination that day and claims the man in the car bore a striking resemblanceto Jack Ruby.Tilson and his daughter Judy were going downtown to pick up another daughter whohad been watching the presidential motorcade. As Tilson was turning east onCommerce from Industrial just west of the Triple Underpass, he said he learnedfrom a police radio monitor he had in his car that Kennedy had been shot.Tilson stated:I saw all these people running to the scene of the shooting. By that time I hadcome across under Stemmons. Everybody was jumping out of their cars and pullingup on the median strip. My daughter Judy noticed the [presidential] limousinecome under the Underpass. They took a right turn onto Stemmons toward ParklandHospital. Well, the limousine just sped past [this] car parked on the grass onthe north side of Elm Street near the west side of the underpass. Here’s one guycoming from the railroad tracks. He came down that grassy slope on the west sideof the Triple Underpass, on the Elm Street side. He had [this] car parked there,a black car. And, he threw something in the back seat and went around the fronthurriedly and got in the car and took off. I was on Commerce Street right thereacross from [the car], fixing to go under the Triple Underpass going into town.I saw all this and I said, “That doesn’t make sense, everybody running to thescene and one person running from it. That’s suspicious as hell.” So, I speededup and went through the Triple Underpass up to Houston . . . made a left . . .[came] back on Main . . . and caught up with him because he got caught on alight. He made a left turn and I made a left turn, going south on Industrial. Itold my daughter to get a pencil and some paper and write down what I tell you.By this time, we had gotten to the toll road [formerly the Dallas–Fort WorthTurnpike, now Interstate 30] going toward Fort Worth. I got the license numberand description of the car and I saw what the man looked like. He was stocky,about five-foot-nine, weighing 185 to 195 pounds and wearing a dark suit. Helooked a hell of a lot more than just a pattern of Jack Ruby. If that wasn’tJack Ruby, it was someone who was his twin brother. Or pretty close. You knowhow Jack wore an old dark suit all the time? He always wore that old suit. Hehad that same old suit on. Anyway, I got the license number and all and exitedoff the turnpike and came back and picked up my other daughter down there atCommerce and Houston. Then I went to a phone and called in the information onthe license number and what I had seen.Tilson’s story is corroborated by his daughter Judy Ladner, although photostaken west of the Triple Underpass at the time do not show the black car. Also,Dallas police radio logs for the day do not indicate any alert for the carTilson described.Tilson maintained that he gave the license number and man’s description to thepolice homicide bureau, “but they never contacted me or did anything about it.”Believing he had done his duty, Tilson threw away the scrap of paper with thelicense number on it. It was only much later that he discovered that hisinformation had been ignored.It would appear that someone in Washington also simply wanted to clear the case,as Tilson was never contacted by either the Warren Commission or the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations.[images/line.jpg]Back in Dealey Plaza, while Sam Holland and other railroad workers were findingevidence of someone waiting behind the picket fence and Jean Hill was beingtaken by men in suits to the sheriff’s office, deputy sheriff Roger Craigthought he saw a suspect flee the scene in a station wagon.The Account of Roger Craig [Contents.html#rsec66]In 1963, Roger Dean Craig was an ambitious young deputy sheriff who was goingplaces.Having run away from his Wisconsin home at age twelve, Craig had received a highschool diploma on his own and had served honorably in the US Army. By 1959 hehad married and taken a job as a sheriff’s deputy in Dallas. Craig already hadreceived four promotions within the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department and in1960 had been named Officer of the Year by the Dallas Traffic Commission.But then came November 22, 1963.Craig’s account of his experiences that day caused considerable problems for theofficial version of the assassination’s aftermath.He recalled that about 10:30 that morning, sheriff Bill Decker calledplainclothes men, detectives, and warrant men into his office and told them thatPresident Kennedy was coming to Dallas and that the motorcade would come downMain Street. According to Craig, Washington had advised Decker to stand down andhe told his employees to stand out in front of the building but to take no partwhatsoever in the motorcade security.Craig later said the crowd of deputies was hostile. “The men about me felt theywere being forced to acknowledge Kennedy’s presence,” he said, adding thedeputies voiced “bitter verbal attacks on President Kennedy,” Craig said. “Theyspoke very strongly against his policies concerning the Bay of Pigs incident andthe Cuban Missile Crisis and they seemed to resent very much the fact thatKennedy was a Catholic.”Craig said just after the motorcade turned on Elm Street, he heard a shot andbegan running toward Dealey Plaza. He ran down the grassy incline between Mainand Elm Street and saw a Dallas police officer run up the Grassy Knoll and gobehind the picket fence near the railroad yards. Craig followed, noting“complete confusion and hysteria” behind the fence. He began to question peoplewhen he noticed a woman in her early thirties attempting to drive out of theparking lot. Craig recalled:I stopped her, identified myself, and placed her under arrest. . . . Thisparking lot was leased by Dallas deputy sheriff B. D. Gossett. He, in turn,rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the courthouse,except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces. . . . I paid Gossettthree dollars a month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point isthat . . . the only people having access to it were deputies with keys. . . .How did this woman gain access and, what is more important, who was she and whydid she have to leave? I turned her over to deputy sheriff C. L. “Lummie” Lewisand . . . [he] told me that he would take her to Sheriff Decker and take care ofher car. . . . I had no way of knowing that an officer with whom I had workedfor four years was capable of losing a thirty-year-old woman and athree-thousand-pound automobile. To this day, Officer Lewis does not know whoshe was, where she came from, or what happened to her. Strange!Meanwhile, Craig questioned people who were standing at the top of the GrassyKnoll, including Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Rowland. Craig said by approximately 12:40p.m. he had turned the Rowlands over to Lummie Lewis and met E. R. Walthers backon the south side of Elm Street where “several officers and bystanders werelooking at the curb on Elm Street where a nick caused by a bullet was reportedto have hit.”He said his attention was attracted by a shrill whistle. In his report ofNovember 23, 1963, Craig wrote:I turned around and saw a white male running down the hill from the direction ofthe Texas School Book Depository Building and I saw what I think was alight-colored Rambler station wagon with luggage rack on top pull over to thecurb and this subject who had come running down the hill get into this car. Theman driving this station wagon was a dark-complected white male. I tried to getacross Elm Street to stop the car and talk with subjects, but the traffic was soheavy I could not make it. I reported this incident at once to a Secret Serviceofficer, whose name I do not know, then I left this area and went at once to the[Depository] building and assisted in the search of the building. Later thatafternoon, I heard that the city had a suspect in custody and I called andreported the information about the suspect running down the hill and gettinginto a car to Captain [Will] Fritz and was required to come at once to CityHall. I went to City Hall and identified the subject they had in custody asbeing the same person I saw running down this hill and get into the stationwagon and leave the scene.Craig later described the driver of the station wagon as a “verydark-complected” man with short, dark hair wearing a white windbreaker-typeshort jacket. Recall the witnesses who told of a dark man or a black man on thesixth floor of the Depository just before Kennedy’s arrival.Craig said since the two men were the only ones he saw trying to flee the scene,he believed the incident “important enough to bring to the attention of theauthorities at a command post which had been set up in front of the Texas SchoolBook Depository.”Here Craig may have had a brush with one of the bogus Secret Service men. Craiglater said as he approached the Depository and asked for someone involved in theinvestigation, a man in a gray suit told him, “I’m with the Secret Service,” andlistened to Craig’s report on assassination witnesses. Craig later recalled, “Heshowed little interest in the persons leaving [the scene]. However, he seemedextremely interested in the description of the Rambler [station wagon]. This wasthe only part of my statement which he wrote down in his little pad he washolding.”On April 1, 1964, Craig described to the Warren Commission his confrontationwith Lee Harvey Oswald at Dallas police headquarters:I drove up to Fritz’s office about, oh, after five—about 5:30 or something likethat—and—uh—talked to Captain Fritz and told him what I had saw. And he took mein his office—I believe it was his office—it was a little office, and had thesuspect sitting in a chair behind a desk—beside the desk. . . . And CaptainFritz asked me was this the man I saw—and I said, “Yes” it was. . . . CaptainFritz then asked him about the—uh—he said, “What about this station wagon?” Andthe suspect [Oswald] interrupted him and said, “That station wagon belongs toMrs. Paine. . . . Don’t try to tie her into this. She had nothing to do withit.” . . . Captain Fritz then told him . . . “All we’re trying to do is find outwhat happened and this man saw you leave from the scene.”Craig said Oswald then interrupted the interview by stating, “Everybody willknow who I am now.” In later years Craig explained Oswald was not boastful butmade the statement in a dejected and dispirited tone, almost as if “his coverhad been blown.” This was all explosive testimony since Oswald officially actedalone and made his way home that day by bus and by taxi. Therefore, the WarrenCommission stated it “could not accept important elements of Craig’s testimony.”It went even further, suggesting that the meeting between Craig and Oswald neveroccurred. According to the Warren Commission Report:Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could not identify did ask tosee him that afternoon and told him a similar story to Craig’s. Fritz did notbring him into his office to identify Oswald but turned him over to LieutenantBaker for questioning. If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him throughthe glass windows of the office.The truth of Craig’s claim to have been in Fritz’s office came in 1969 with thepublication of Dallas police chief Jesse Curry’s assassination file. On page 72[Chapter002a.html#page_72] is a photograph captioned “The Homicide Bureau Officeunder guard while Oswald was being interrogated.” In the photograph, well insidethe homicide office, stands deputy sheriff Roger Craig.Craig also pointed out to Warren Commission attorneys that he had learned thatRuth Paine, with whom Oswald’s wife, Marina, was living, indeed owned a lightgreen station wagon. Support for Craig came in 1992 with the public release ofDallas Police files on the case. A December 23, 1963, “Criminal Intelligence”report made by Dallas detective T. T. Wardlaw regarding an attempted visit byRuth Paine to Marina Oswald stated, “Mrs. Payne [sic] left at 12:20 p.m. Shedrove a 1955 Chevrolet station wagon, color two-tone green, bearing 1963 Texaslicense number NK 4041 which is registered to her at 2515 West Fifth Street,Irving, Texas.”His insistence on sticking with his story despite repeated attempts byauthorities to have both Craig and Arnold Rowland change their testimony beganto cause problems for Craig within the Sheriff’s Department. Initially, SheriffDecker had backed Craig, calling him “completely honest.” But later, Craig’scredibility began to slip within the department and on July 4, 1967, he wasfired by Decker. Some say the cause was laxity and improprieties in his work,while others say it was due to his unyielding position on the assassination.In recent years there seems to be growing corroboration for Craig’s story.First, a photograph taken in Dealey Plaza minutes after the assassination showsCraig in the exact locations he described. There are even two photos of astation wagon moving west on Elm.In later years, researchers discovered Warren Commission Document 5, independentcorroboration of Craig’s story that was not published in the Commission’stwenty-six volumes. In this document, an FBI report dated the day after theassassination, motorist Marvin C. Robinson reported he had just passed HoustonStreet driving west on Elm Street in heavy traffic when he saw a station wagon,either gray or green, stop in front of the Texas School Book Depository and awhite man walk down the grassy incline and get into the vehicle, which drovewest on Elm.In later years, Roger Craig—though vindicated in the controversy over hisassassination testimony—continued to live with hard luck. His wife left him—somesay due to pressure over his involvement in the assassination—and his back wasinjured in a car accident. His original account of his experiences began to growin detail and complexity as he sought acceptance for his story. He even claimedto have been the object of murder attempts.On May 15, 1975, Roger Craig, then only thirty-nine years old, was killed by arifle bullet. His death was ruled a suicide.The Three Tramps [Contents.html#rsec67]Within an hour of the assassination, Dallas police sergeant D. V. Harkness hadan encounter with three strange fellows, whom many researchers believe may havebeen involved in the shooting. It is one of the more convoluted of theassassination issues.Union Pacific Railroad dispatcher Lee Bowers saw three men sneak into an emptyrailroad car in the train yards just behind the Texas School Book Depositorymoments after the assassination. Bowers ordered the train stopped by radio andthen summoned Dallas police. Several officers, including Harkness, rousted thetrio from the railcar at gunpoint and marched them to the Dallas CountySheriff’s Office. Their route took them past the Depository and across theeastern portion of Dealey Plaza. At least three news photographers took picturesof the three men as they were marched through the plaza under guard. Thesephotographs are the only proof that this incident occurred.In later years Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, who as chief of special operationsfor the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Kennedy acted as liaison with theCIA, stated his immediate superior, General Edward Lansdale, was photographedwalking by the three tramps in Dealey Plaza and perhaps even passing them somesort of signal. As Kennedy’s assistant secretary of defense for specialoperations, Lansdale was the ranking member of Operation Mongoose, the secretwar against Castro to include assassinations. Prouty’s identification ofLansdale was corroborated in a 1985 letter to Prouty from Marine LieutenantGeneral Victor H. Kurlak, the highly decorated special assistant forcounterinsurgency activities of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both Prouty andKurlak had worked with Lansdale for a number of years.Once in the sheriff’s custody, the three tramps officially disappeared. Althoughreportedly transferred later to the Dallas police station, they reportedly werenever booked and any names, information, or fingerprints taken were not seenbefore 1992. The House Subcommittee on Government Information and IndividualRights discovered in 1975 that Dallas police arrest records for November 22,1963, compiled for the Warren Commission, were missing.Were “tramps” actually near the assassination site at the time of the shooting?In 1981, Kent Biffle, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote an articledetailing his experience that day that pinpointed the tramp arrests as shortlyafter the assassination:Everyone was pointing toward a fence that connected with the Underpass. . . . Iran that way. Some teenagers followed. One of them darted ahead and hit thefence before I did. . . . Puffing, I followed him. The other side of the fencerevealed no gunman. There was just a maze of railroad tracks and three dazedwinos. “What happened?” I asked one. “What happened?” he asked me. People werestill climbing over the fence. I ran east toward the Texas School BookDepository.Much like those of the “umbrella man” and the dark-complected man of DealeyPlaza, the identities of the three tramps were the object of speculation amongassassination researchers. Although they were labeled “tramps,” photos show themen had recent haircuts, shined shoes, and old but unsoiled clothing. In thephotographs they hardly appear to be genuine tramps or winos.In 1976 the three tramps drew national attention when comedian/social activistDick Gregory and others claimed that two of the men were none other than CIAoperatives and Watergate conspirators E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis. Thisallegation was repeated in the book Coup d’État in America. It was quickly,though not conclusively, dismissed. In the summer of 1985, E. Howard Hunt lost alibel court case based on a national article that claimed CIA documentsindicated he was in Dallas the day of the assassination. After the 1980 arrestof convicted assassin Charles V. Harrelson, researchers took a fresh look at thetramps, particularly the youngest of the trio. Many researchers now believeHarrelson was the tall tramp. Other men with CIA connections also were named,such as Thomas Vallee, Fred Lee Chrisman, and Daniel Carswell.With the lack of records, other names were thrown into the mix. In 1991 LoisGibson, a forensic facial recognition expert with the Houston Police Department,stated publicly that an investigation convinced her the three tramps wereHarrelson; Charles Frederick Rogers, also known as Richard Montoya, who waswanted for the 1965 murder of his parents in Houston; and a man named ChaunceyHolt.Holt, located in California, gave a convincing, if not provable, account of hisrole in the assassination. He claimed to have once been an accountant formobster Meyer Lansky but had also forged documents for the CIA. Holt said hedelivered phony Secret Service identification to Dallas before the assassinationin the company of Harrelson. Like so many other instances in the assassinationcase, those named by Holt who might have vouched for his story were either deador missing. Holt died of cancer in 1997.But just as the tramps story began to come together like the plot of a Mission:Impossible episode, it fell apart. As the public spotlight was once againfocusing on the tramp issue, the Dallas City Council in 1992 decided to opentheir old police files, in which suddenly were found three arrest records namingthe three tramps as a Harold Doyle, John Forester Gedney, and Gus W. Abrams.Abrams was dead but Doyle and Gedney were located in Oregon and Florida and bothsaid they indeed were arrested in Dallas on November 22, 1963.The FBI looked into the matter and a report later in 1992 described how thethree men had arrived by rail in Dallas early on the morning of theassassination. After showering and receiving fresh clothes and a meal from anIrving Street mission, the trio again boarded a gondola car where they werearrested by Dallas police. According to this report, the three were convicted ofvagrancy and sentenced to six days in jail only to be released four days laterdue to overcrowding. But problems remained.Although by all accounts the trio were pulled out of the train cars only momentsafter the assassination, afternoon shadows and the lack of a crowd in the newsphotographs indicated the pictures were made later in the afternoon, long afterthe 12:30 p.m. shooting. The three arrest reports, all written and signed by thesame Officer Chambers, gave an arrest time of 4 p.m. Other than the threereports, there were no jail records or court hearings concerning the trio.Plus, the story of the three railroad tramps left no room for Charles VoydeHarrelson, a convicted hit man with some independent evidence to support theidea that he was involved.Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire, Harrelson—the father ofactor Woody Harrelson—had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworldcharacters linked directly to Jack Ruby. This connection first came to theattention of JFK researchers when Harrelson was arrested near Van Horn, Texas,September 1, 1980. He had been identified as a suspect in the death of federaljudge John Wood of San Antonio, who was shot in an ambush by a high-poweredrifle.High on cocaine, which is well-known for loosening the inhibitions, and pointinga pistol to his own head, Harrelson held lawmen at bay for six hours. Duringthis time, according to the arresting officers, he not only confessed to theJudge Wood killing, but also claimed he had participated in the Kennedyassassination. This statement, repeated in some Texas newspapers, sentassassination researchers to their files looking for confirmation.The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White, who testified before the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations, already had noticed the resemblance ofHarrelson to the youngest tramp. Harrelson was forty-seven years old in 1985,making him twenty-five at the time of the assassination. This corresponds withthe age of the youngest tramp, who was thought to have been between twenty-fiveand thirty years old.In June 1981, Harrelson was interviewed by Chuck Cook, then a reporter for theDallas Morning News. In a telephone interview with this author, Cook recalled,“I asked about the Kennedy assassination and he got this sly grin on his face.Harrelson is very intelligent and has a way of not answering when it suits him.”Cook said at a later interview he again brought the subject up and thatHarrelson became very serious. Cook quoted Harrelson as saying, “Listen, if andwhen I get out of here and feel free to talk, I will have something that will bethe biggest story you ever had.” When Cook asked what that story might be,Harrelson would only reply, “November 22, 1963. You remember that!”Intrigued with the possibilities, Cook said he later showed photographs of thethree tramps to Harrelson’s wife, Jo Ann Harrelson, who “was amazed at thesimilarities.” Cook added, “Then I gave the photos to one of Harrelson’sattorneys and he was supposed to show them to Harrelson. But that’s the last Iheard of it. He didn’t want to talk about it because he felt his jail cell wasbugged, and rightly so.”It was later revealed that Harrelson’s jail conversations were indeed beingmonitored.In an interview with Dallas TV newsman Quin Mathews, Harrelson offered furthercomments on the Kennedy assassination. “You said you’d killed PresidentKennedy?” commented Mathews. Harrelson replied:At the same time I said I killed the judge, I said I had killed Kennedy, whichmight give you an idea as to the state of my mind at the time. . . . It was aneffort to elongate my life. . . . Well, do you believe Lee Harvey Oswald killedPresident Kennedy alone, without any aid from a rogue agency of the USGovernment or at least a portion of that agency? I believe you are very naïve ifyou do.White became convinced that Harrelson was the youngest of the three tramps.White told this author, “I have done various photographic comparison tests andeverything matches . . . the hair, the nose, the ear, the profile. It’sHarrelson.”But over and above the comparisons of Harrelson’s photograph with that of theyoungest tramp, further evidence indicates Harrelson very well may have played arole in the assassination. When arrested, Harrelson was carrying the businesscard of R. D. Matthews. In subsequent interviews, Harrelson admitted to being aclose friend of Matthews. In fact, Harrelson said he looked up to Matthews as afather.Russell Douglas Matthews, a former Dallas underworld character, is mentioned inthe Warren Report as a “passing acquaintance” of Jack Ruby’s and is obliquelyconnected with a Ruby-backed jeep sale to Cuba in 1959.The House Select Committee on Assassinations indicated Matthews’s relationshipwith Ruby was more than “passing” and described Matthews as a man “activelyengaged in criminal activity since the 1940s.” The committee also documentedMatthews’s connections to Dallas gamblers Lewis McWillie, that close friend tothe Kirkwoods of Fort Worth, and local gambler Benny Binion—both closelyacquainted with Ruby. The committee further developed evidence that Matthews wasin contact with associates of Florida crime chieftain Santos Trafficante Jr. andwas linked to Texas underworld characters, such as Hollis de Lois Green, JettieBass, Nick Cascio, and James Todd—all acquaintances of Harrelson’s.In a strange sidelight, Matthews was best man at the wedding of a Dallasunderworld figure named George McGann to Beverly Oliver. A friend to Ruby aswell as several of his employees, Oliver became known to researchers as the“babushka lady.”The former chief counsel of the House committee, G. Robert Blakey, in his bookThe Plot to Kill the President, reiterated the committee’s findings that Kennedywas assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving organized crime andthat more than one gunman was involved.If organized crime in Dallas was involved—and Ruby’s role would seem to justifythat conclusion—then the entire spectrum of the Dallas underworld becomessuspect. And we come back to young Charles Harrelson.But there is evidence that Harrelson’s contacts went far beyond Dallas policecharacters. Indicted along with Harrelson in the plot to kill Judge Wood was thebrother of reputed New Orleans crime boss Carlos Marcello, another of theorganized-crime figures the House Select Committee on Assassinations named aspossibly involved in the Kennedy assassination conspiracy. There was alsoHarrelson’s involvement with criminals connected to intelligence agencies andeven the military.In April 1982, Florida law-enforcement officials identified Harrelson as being amember of a shadowy group of hired gunmen, mercenaries, and drug smugglers knownas “The Company.”The Company, which according to lawmen took its nickname from the CIA, involvedmore than three hundred persons, many ex-police or ex-military men. Federal drugagents said the group imported billions of dollars’ worth of narcotics fromCentral and South America as well as conducting gunrunning and mercenaryoperations. During one criminal trial involving members of the group, federalprosecutors claimed The Company owned more than $30 million in assets such asplanes, ships, and real estate.Florida lawmen investigating this group claimed Harrelson was a member and thatJimmy Chagra, the man who allegedly hired Harrelson to kill the judge, also oncehired The Company for protection.Oddly enough, the very day that Harrelson was formally charged with the JudgeWood assassination—April 16, 1982—a Dallas news reporter and a JFK assassinationresearcher were scheduled to meet with Harrelson to discuss his role in theKennedy murder. Although Harrelson had been jailed for more than a year and ahalf, when the formal charges were filed, all visits to him were canceled. JFKresearcher and author J. Gary Shaw claimed, “I feel this was done at thatparticular time to prevent Harrelson from revealing what he knows.”During Harrelson’s trial, Joe Chagra, brother of Jimmy, testified that Harrelsongot the Wood contract after telling his brother that he had participated in theJFK assassination. Researchers find it remarkable that a man reputed to be ahigh-ranking mobster by government agents should hire Harrelson on this claimrather than boot him out of his office—since everyone had been told theassassination was caused by only a lone nut.Harrelson, who died in prison in 2007 while serving a life sentence in the Woodassassination, was never interviewed thoroughly about his role in Dallas, thoughhis son’s acting career prospered. Researchers are left only with his crypticreminder: “November 22, 1963. You remember that!”Today, Warren Commission apologists are content to lay the three-trampscontroversy aside as a dead issue. But many researchers believe that some sortof shenanigan was pulled to distract from the truth. One offered explanation wasthat Doyle, Abrams, and Gedney were indeed railroad bums arrested in Dallas thatday but in a separate incident and were not the same men photographed beingmarched through Dealey Plaza. If nothing else, the tramp issue illustrates thegaps, omissions, and general lack of meaningful investigation in the Kennedyassassination.[images/line.jpg]The “three tramps” were not the only persons arrested on the day of theassassination. More than a dozen people were taken into custody, and it willforever remain puzzling that few records were kept on any of them. It seems thatonce Oswald was captured, the authorities lost interest in anyone else.A Catholic priest told this author of observing the arrest of a young manwearing a three-piece suit and gloves who was then escorted from the TexasSchool Book Depository to the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office. He said heoverheard the arresting officers say, “Well, we got one of them.” There is norecord of such an arrest.Assassination witness Phil Willis told researchers that shortly after theshooting, police escorted a man in a black leather jacket and black gloves fromthe Dal-Tex Building—which lies directly east of the Depository and the buildingfrom which several researchers believe shots may have come. Again there is norecord of such an arrest, though this man may have been Larry Florer, who wasarrested in the Dal-Tex Building. In a statement to authorities, Florer said hetried to use a telephone in the Dal-Tex Building but found they were all busy.He was taken into custody as he tried to leave the building.Another man arrested in the Dal-Tex Building was a Mafia-connected policecharacter with a record of more than thirty arrests and oblique connections toJack Ruby.The Mafia Man in Dealey Plaza [Contents.html#rsec68]Moments after the assassination, an elevator operator in the Dal-Tex Buildingnoticed a man he did not recognize. The operator summoned deputy sheriff C. L.“Lummie” Lewis, who arrested the man. He identified himself as Jim Braden.Taken to the sheriff’s office for questioning, Braden said he was visitingDallas on oil business and was staying at the Cabana Motel, a motor inn onStemmons Freeway built with Teamster money. He said he had entered the Dal-TexBuilding to use the telephone when he was taken into custody.With no information to the contrary, authorities released Braden three hourslater. It was an unfortunate decision. What is now known is that Braden hadrecently legally changed his name from Eugene Hale Brading. If the authoritieshad obtained that name on November 22, 1963, there perhaps would have been moreinterest in the man. Braden/Brading was a man with a police record stretchingback to 1934 for such crimes as burglary, embezzlement, mail fraud, andconspiracy, including several arrests in Dallas.Braden’s story, which has been pieced together over the years by a variety ofresearchers and news reporters, indicated this man may have been more deeplyinvolved in the assassination than was first suspected. On parole in Californiafor mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property, Braden hadinformed his parole officer that he would be in Dallas from November 21 to 25,1963. He said on November 21, 1963, he visited the offices of Texas oilman H. L.Hunt to meet with Hunt’s son, Lamar. Interestingly, Jack Ruby also was at theHunt offices about that same time, ostensibly to help a young woman get a job.Both Braden and Ruby denied these visits, though they have been verified by morethan one office worker.And Braden, along with ex-convict Morgan Brown, was staying at the Cabana Motel,the same motel Ruby visited the night of November 21.Furthermore, in the book Legacy of Doubt, CBS newsman Peter Noyes documentedBraden’s connections to a number of underworld figures, including Meyer Lansky.Apparently Braden was known as a Mafia courier.Most sinister of all, Braden may have been in contact with the New OrleansMafia-CIA man, David Ferrie, Lee Harvey Oswald’s former Civil Air Patrol leader.Noyes found that in the weeks immediately preceding the assassination, Bradenwas in and out of Room 1701 of the Pere Marquette Building in New Orleans, justdown the hall from Room 1707, where Ferrie was working for an attorney of Mafiaboss Carlos Marcello.Another fascinating connection between Braden and the assassination concerns twoNew York businessmen, Lawrence and Edward Meyers. Lawrence Meyers was a personalfriend of Jack Ruby’s. On November 20 and 21, 1963, Meyers also was staying atthe Cabana Motel in Dallas. While in Dallas, Meyers told the FBI he was withJean West, a “rather dumb, but accommodating broad.” Edward Meyers was in Dallasto attend the bottlers convention—the same convention Richard Nixon attended.Both brothers were visited by Jack Ruby briefly at the Cabana Motel on the nightof November 21—the night Braden was at the same motel.While no direct connections between this group and Ferrie in New Orleans havebeen documented, it is fascinating to note that when New Orleans districtattorney Jim Garrison began looking at long-distance telephone calls for DavidFerrie he discovered something—the same day Oswald left New Orleans for hisreported trip to Mexico City, Ferrie called a number in Chicago that belonged toMeyer’s friend Jean West.In Warren Commission Exhibit 2350—a listing of telephone calls made by LawrenceMeyers in November 1963—it was found that that same day he, too, called theChicago number of Jean West, the woman who accompanied him to Dallas. While notconclusive, these documents suggest possible connections between Jack Ruby andDavid Ferrie via Meyers/West and Braden.Meyers also told the Warren Commission that his friend Ruby had called him thenight before shooting Oswald. The next day, upon hearing the news that Ruby hadshot Oswald, Meyers decided not to contact Dallas police because “in light ofthe apparent hectic activities then ensuing at the police station, it would bebetter if he did not do so.”All of this occurred in the context of Braden’s visit to Dallas. The HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations tried to sort out the truth of Braden’s visitas well as his contacts, to little avail.First Braden said he made the trip to Dallas from California and met with aDallas parole officer at the moment of the assassination. However, the paroleofficer could not recall such a meeting. If Braden had not notified his paroleoffice that he was leaving California, he would have been in violation of paroleand subject to arrest. Braden told the committee he walked as far as the Dal-TexBuilding in an effort to find a telephone so he could call his mother and tellher about the assassination. He denied he ever was in Dealey Plaza.However, due to statements made while in custody and the fact that Braden hasdefinitely been identified in Dealey Plaza photographs, it is now widelyaccepted that Braden lied and was among the spectators gathered in Dealey Plazaminutes after the shooting.This fact alone—that a known felon with many ties to Mafia figures, New Orleans,and Jack Ruby would be hanging around Dealey Plaza just after Kennedy’sdeath—creates deep suspicion about the immediate Dallas investigation and, evenmore particularly, the subsequent federal investigation. This suspicion isheightened in light of the fact that in 1976, the National Archives revealedthat at least two documents relating to the Braden arrest were missing.[images/line.jpg]One of the oddest arrests that day was reported only in a Dallas newspaper.The November 22, 1963, edition of the Dallas Times Herald reported that apoliceman arrested a man wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a plaid coat, and araincoat after Depository employees pointed to him from a third-floor window.The news account said the man was taken under protest to the Sheriff’sDepartment, while members of the crowd shouted, “I hope you die!” and “I hopeyou burn!”Three weeks later, the same newspaper reported that “an early suspect in theassassination of President Kennedy was still in jail—but no longer a suspect inthe killing.” This account said the man was arrested minutes after theassassination after police swarmed into the railroad yards where “a man wasreported seen in that area carrying a rifle.” The story said thestill-unidentified man was being held on “city charges.”Who was this man and what, if anything, did he know about the assassination?Another odd arrest—that of Jack Lawrence—also deserves more serious study.Lawrence was arrested late on the afternoon on November 22, 1963, after hisactions caused suspicions among his coworkers at Downtown Lincoln-Mercury,located two blocks west of Dealey Plaza.Lawrence had obtained a job as a car salesman at the dealership just one monthbefore the assassination with job references from New Orleans that later werefound to be phony. Lawrence never sold a car and on the day before theassassination, he had borrowed one of the firm’s cars, after telling his boss hehad a “heavy date.”On Friday, November 22, Lawrence failed to show up for work. However, aboutthirty minutes after the assassination, he came hustling through the company’sshowroom, pale and sweating. He told coworkers he had been ill that morning andthat he had tried to drive the car back to the dealership but had to park it dueto the heavy traffic. Later, employees found the car parked behind the woodenpicket fence on top of the Grassy Knoll overlooking Dealey Plaza.Lawrence’s activities were so suspicious that employees called police, whopicked up Lawrence that evening. Lawrence, who reportedly was an expert marksmanin the Air Force, left Dallas after being released the next day.In 1991, after researcher Sheldon Inkol detailed Lawrence’s story in The ThirdDecade, a JFK assassination newsletter, Inkol received a call from Lawrence,whom he described as “intelligent, articulate and good-humored” but irate. Hedenied any role in the assassination and said he parked his “loaner” car at theintersection of Ervay and Main Streets due to traffic and hurried to the cardealership so as not to be late for work.A suspicious car salesman, a man held on nebulous charges for days, a Mafia manin Dealey Plaza, the three tramps—what could all this mean? Chauncey Holt,himself a suspect, may have provided the answer when he told Newsweek in 1991:Dallas that day was flooded with all kinds of people who ended up there for somereason. It’s always been my theory that whoever was the architect of thisthing—and no one will ever know who was behind it, manipulating all thesepeople—I believe that they flooded this area with so many characters withnefarious reputations because they thought, “Well, if all these people getscooped up it’ll muddy the waters so much that they’ll never straighten it out.”Of course, the most prominent arrest of that day was when Dallas police nabbedLee Harvey Oswald less than an hour and a half after the assassination. But suchrapid police action was precipitated by yet another tragic shooting—the slayingof Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit.The Shooting of J. D. Tippit [Contents.html#rsec69]Of all the aspects of the Kennedy assassination, the shooting of Dallaspoliceman Jefferson Davis Tippit has received less attention than most others.Allegedly Tippit was shot down while attempting to arrest Lee Harvey Oswaldforty-five minutes after the assassination in Oak Cliff, south of downtownDallas. It was the slaying of this policeman that led to Oswald’s arrest and inmany ways became a cornerstone of the case for Oswald’s guilt. Warren Commissionattorney David Belin called the shooting the “Rosetta Stone to the JFKassassination.” “After all,” stated the conventional wisdom of 1963–1964,“Oswald killed that policeman. Why would he do that if he hadn’t killed thepresident?”Yet today a growing body of evidence suggests that Oswald did not killTippit—which, if true, reverses the above argument—if it can be shown thatOswald did not shoot the policeman, then perhaps he didn’t shoot the president.Little is known about Tippit or his life and personal contacts. This absence ofinformation prompted researcher Sylvia Meagher to write:Tippit, the policeman and the man, is a one-dimensional and insubstantialfigure—unknown and unknowable. The [Warren] Commission was not interested inTippit’s life, and apparently interested in his death only to the extent that itcould be ascribed to Oswald, despite massive defects in the evidence againsthim.The commission failed to mention that Tippit’s death occurred only two blocksfrom Ruby’s home on Marsalis Street. Yet with no real knowledge of Tippit’sbackground or associations and with a number of problems with the evidence, theWarren Commission nevertheless concluded that Oswald was his killer. This wasbased on four primary pieces of evidence.1Two witnesses who saw the shooting and seven who saw a man fleeing “positivelyidentified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw fire the shots or flee from thescene.”The chief witness for the Warren Commission was Helen Markham, whosecredibility, even at the time of the Commission, was strained to the breakingpoint. Markham claimed to have talked for some time with the dying Tippit, yetmedical authorities said he was killed instantly. She said she saw Tippit’skiller talk with the policeman through his patrol car’s right-hand window,although pictures taken at the scene show that window was shut.She was in hysterics at the time and even left her shoes on top of Tippit’s car.Later, in her testimony before the Warren Commission, Markham stated six timesshe did not recognize anyone in the police lineup that evening, beforeCommission attorney Joseph Ball prompted, “Was there a number-two man in there?”Markham responded, “Number two is the one I picked. . . . When I saw this man Iwasn’t sure, but I had cold chills just run all over me.”Furthermore, other witnesses at the scene—William Scoggins, Ted Calloway, andEmory Austin—even today claim they never saw Markham in the minutes immediatelyfollowing the shooting.Cabdriver Scoggins also identified Oswald that day, although Scoggins admittedhe did not actually witness the shooting and his view of the fleeing killer wasobscured because he ducked down behind his cab as the man came by. Scoggins andcabdriver William Whaley, who allegedly drove Oswald home that day, both vieweda Dallas police lineup composed of five “young teenagers” and Oswald. Whaleytold the Warren Commission:You could have picked [Oswald] out without identifying him by just listening tohim because he was bawling out the policemen, telling them it wasn’t right toput him in line with these teenagers. . . . He showed no respect for thepolicemen, he told them what he thought about them. . . . They were trying torailroad him and he wanted his lawyer. . . . Anybody who wasn’t sure could havepicked out the right one just for that.If his protestations weren’t enough to guide the witnesses in identifyingOswald, the suspect had conspicuous bruises and a black eye. Furthermore, Oswaldstated during the lineup he was asked his name and place of employment. ByFriday evening, everyone in Dallas who attended the police lineups had heardthat shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository.On Saturday, Scoggins again identified Oswald, although in his Warren Commissiontestimony he admitted seeing Oswald’s photograph in a morning paper beforeviewing the police lineup. His identification of Oswald fell further intodisrepute when he told the Commission that after the lineup, an FBI or SecretService agent showed him several pictures of men, which Scoggins narrowed downto two. Scoggins recalled, “I told them one of these two pictures is him[Oswald] . . . and then he told me the other one was Oswald.”These were the star government witnesses. Other witnesses, including DomingoBenavides—the person closest to the killing—were never asked to view a lineupnor were they able to identify Oswald as the killer.Several other witnesses, including Acquilla Clemons, a black woman who claimedtwo men were involved in the Tippit shooting but was ignored by the federalauthorities. Clemons claimed she was threatened into silence by a man with a gunand was never questioned. The Warren Commission denied knowledge of Clemons,stating, “The only woman among the witnesses to the slaying of Tippit known tothe Commission is Helen Markham.”Markham’s testimony was inconsistent. She initially stated Tippit’s killer wasshort and stocky with bushy hair. This is the same description given by Clemons,who in a filmed interview said the killer was “kind of a short guy . . . kind ofheavy.” Markham later denied giving this description.Frank Wright lived near the scene of the Tippit shooting. He heard shots and ranoutside. His wife called the police, who contacted the Dudley M. Hughesambulance service. The call slip carried the Wright’s address and arrived,according to the ambulance records, at 1:18 p.m. In an interview with privateresearchers less than a year later, Wright said:I saw a man standing in front of the car. He was looking toward the man on theground. . . . He had on a long coat. It ended just above his hands. I didn’t seeany gun. He ran around on the passenger side of the police car. He ran as fastas he could go, and he got into his car. His car was a little gray old coupe. Itwas about a 1950–51, maybe a Plymouth. It was a gray car, parked on the sameside of the street as the police car, but beyond it from me. It was heading awayfrom me. He got in that car and he drove away as fast as you could see. . . .After that a whole lot of police came up. I tried to tell two or three peoplewhat I saw. They didn’t pay any attention. I’ve seen what came out on televisionand in the newspaper, but I know that’s not what happened.Another witness was Warren Reynolds, who chased Tippit’s killer. He, too, failedto identify Oswald as Tippit’s killer until after he himself was shot in thehead two months later. After recovering, Reynolds identified Oswald to theWarren Commission. A suspect was arrested in the Reynolds shooting, but releasedwhen a former Jack Ruby stripper named Betty Mooney MacDonald provided an alibi.One week after her word released the suspect, MacDonald was arrested by Dallaspolice and a few hours later was found hanged in her jail cell. Neither the FBInor the Warren Commission investigated this strange incident.2The cartridge cases found near the Tippit slaying “were fired from the revolverin the possession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of allother weapons,” claimed the Warren Commission.There are many problems with this evidence. First, at the time of the Tippitshooting, Dallas police sergeant Gerald Hill radioed the police dispatcher,saying, “The shells at the scene indicate that the suspect is armed with anautomatic .38 rather than a pistol.” Oswald reportedly was captured with a .38Special revolver. There is a significant difference between an automatic, whichejects spent shells onto the ground, and a revolver, which requires deliberateemptying of the weapon. These weapons also use different types of ammunition.Other officers at the scene believed that an automatic weapon was used, based onthe distance from Tippit’s body to where the shells were found and what someperceived to be scratches from an automatic’s ejector on the shells. If anautomatic was used, then Oswald’s revolver cannot be blamed for Tippit’s death.Then there’s the problem of identification of the empty shells. Policeman J. M.Poe received two cartridge cases from witness Domingo Benavides at the scene. Inan FBI report, Poe firmly stated that he marked the cases with his initials,“J.M.P.” before turning them over to Dallas crime lab personnel.However, on June 12, 1964, the FBI showed Poe the four .38-caliber Special casesused as evidence of Oswald’s guilt by the Warren Commission. The bureaureported:[Poe] recalled marking these cases before giving them to [lab personnel], but hestated after a thorough examination of the four cartridges shown to him . . . hecannot locate his marks; therefore, he cannot positively identify any of thesecartridges as being the same ones he received from Benavides.Testifying to the Warren Commission, Poe vacillated, saying he couldn’t swear tomarking the cases. However, asked to identify the cartridges, Poe also stated,“I want to say these two are mine, but I couldn’t swear to it.” Poe’s failure tofind his initials on the cases, coupled with the fact that the cases were notturned over to the FBI until six days after other inventoried evidence, leavesmany researchers with the suspicion that shell cases from Oswald’s revolver weresubstituted for the ones Poe marked.To further confuse the issue, the Warren Commission discovered that the shellcases allegedly recovered at the scene of the shooting do not match up with theslugs recovered from Tippit’s body. Of the four cases, two are ofWinchester-Western manufacture and two of Remington-Peters, while of the bulletsremoved from Tippit, only one is Remington-Peters and three are fromWinchester-Western.Weakly, the Warren Commission attempted to explain this anomaly by surmisingthat perhaps a fifth shot had been fired but not recovered, although most of thewitnesses recalled no more than four shots, or that perhaps Oswald already hadan expended Remington-Peters case in his pistol before shooting Tippit. TheCommission even suggested that perhaps “to save money . . . he might have loadedone make of bullet into another make of cartridge case.”This, of course, would require Oswald to own or have access to reloadingequipment. It should be pointed out that when arrested, Oswald reportedly wascarrying five live Winchester-Western pistol bullets in his pocket in additionto the fully loaded revolver, which apparently was never tested to determine ifit had been fired recently. With this exception, authorities found no otherammunition or gun-related materials in any of Oswald’s possessions.3The Warren Commission determined that the revolver in Oswald’s possession at thetime of his arrest was purchased by and belonged to him. While this segment ofthe evidence against Oswald may be true—some researchers are not convinced thatthe weapons order signed by A. J. Hidell can conclusively be traced to Oswald—itdoes not prove that the gun was used to kill Tippit.For instance, even the FBI’s resources failed to prove that the slugs recoveredfrom Tippit’s body had been fired from Oswald’s pistol. FBI officials claimedthat since the Oswald revolver had been rechambered to accept .38 Specialammunition, the barrel was oversize for the bullet, causing inconsistentballistic markings. Thus, “consecutive bullets fired in the revolver by the FBIcould not even be identified with each other under the microscope,” stated theCommission in an appendix to its report. This statement is most odd, for severalfirearms experts have told this author that similar .38 Special bullets do fitthe rifling grooves and can be checked ballistically.If the slugs from Tippit’s body cannot be matched to Oswald’s revolver, perhapsit is because they did not come from that gun. Adding fuel to this speculationis the statement of Eddie Kinsley, the ambulance attendant who drove themortally wounded Tippit to a hospital. In recent years, Kinsley told newsmanEarl Golz of an extraneous bullet. According to Kinsley, as he unloaded Tippitfrom his ambulance, “I kicked one of the bullets out of my ambulance that wentinto his button . . . onto the parking lot of Methodist Hospital. It didn’t goin the body. . . . It fell off the ambulance still in this button.”Since Tippit reportedly was struck by all four bullets fired at him and theseslugs were placed in evidence with the Warren Commission, what is theexplanation for Kinsley’s fifth slug? Kinsley told Golz he had never beenquestioned by the Warren Commission.Recent work by Texas researchers indicates that the cases now residing in theNational Archives and exhibited by the Warren Commission as the shells used inthe Tippit slaying could not have been fired by Oswald’s pistol. Oswald’s pistolwas originally a Military and Police Smith & Wesson 1905 Model .38-caliberrevolver, the largest-selling quality revolver ever produced.The pistol in question, serial number V510210, was converted to a .38 SpecialModel. This involved cutting off the barrel from its original five inches to twoand a quarter inches. The Warren Commission said the pistol also was rechamberedto accept .38 Special ammunition—slightly smaller in diameter but longer than.38 Standard ammunition.In the 1980s, Texas researcher and veteran hunter Larry Howard discovered afterbuying an exact duplicate of Oswald’s .38 revolver that the .38 Specialcartridges, when fired in a rechambered weapon, bulge noticeably in the center.Howard told this author:I have checked this with several expert gunsmiths. Since the rechambering cannotchange the diameter of the cylinder, but only makes it longer to accept .38Special ammo, the bullet bulges in the middle when fired. I’ve done it timeafter time. My wife can notice the bulge. The case looks like it’s pregnant.Studying the shells depicted in the Warren Commission volumes and also in aclose-up clear photograph in the November 1983 commemorative issue of Lifemagazine, it appears to everyone that the shell cases in the National Archives[supposedly the casings found at the scene of Tippit’s death] do not show anybulging at all. This indicates to me and other experts that those cases couldnot have been fired from the .38 Special that was supposed to belong to Oswald.Until further testing can be done on the cartridge cases in question, this ishardly solid proof of Oswald’s innocence in the Tippit shooting. But it is afurther example of the wide gaps still open in the case against Oswald.4According to the Warren Commission, Oswald’s jacket was found along the path offlight taken by Tippit’s killer.The Warren Commission wrote:Oswald was seen leaving his rooming-house at about 1 p.m. wearing a zipperjacket. . . . The man who killed Tippit was wearing a light-colored jacket, thathe was seen running along Jefferson Boulevard, that a jacket was found under acar in a lot adjoining Jefferson Boulevard. . . . When he was arrested atapproximately 1:50 p.m., he was in shirtsleeves. These facts warrant the findingthat Lee Harvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of theTippit killing.But did the facts warrant such a conclusion? Not really, since almost everyaspect of the jacket story has since come under question. Oswald, it is known,had only two jackets—one blue and one a lightweight gray zipper jacket. The blueone was later found in the basement lunchroom of the Depository building. Atleast two witnesses at the scene of Tippit’s slaying reported his killer wore awhite jacket.One of these witnesses, Helen Markham, was shown Oswald’s gray jacket by aWarren Commission attorney who asked, “Did you ever see this before?” Despitehaving been shown the jacket by the FBI prior to her testimony, Markham replied,“No, I did not . . . that jacket is a darker jacket than that, I know it was.”Witness Domingo Benavides was shown a jacket by Commission attorney David Belin,who said, “I am handing you a jacket which had been marked as ‘Commission’sExhibit 163,’ and ask you to state whether this bears any similarity to thejacket you saw this man with the gun wearing?” The accommodating Benavidesresponded, “I would say this looks just like it.”The problem here is that Commission Exhibit 163 is Oswald’s dark blue jacket.The gray jacket is Commission Exhibit 162. Here is yet another example of awitness obligingly providing the answers he felt were desired.Another example is cabdriver William Whaley, who reportedly drove Oswald homefrom downtown Dallas. Whaley identified the gray jacket as the one Oswald waswearing in his cab. Yet the Warren Commission, based on testimony from EarleneRoberts, Oswald’s landlady, stated that Oswald put on the jacket after arrivingat his lodgings.Testifying to the Warren Commission, Roberts said:[Oswald] went to his room and he was in his shirtsleeves . . . and he got ajacket and put it on—it was kind of a zipper jacket. [She then was shownCommission Exhibit 162, Oswald’s gray jacket, and asked if she had seen itbefore] . . . Well, maybe I have, but I don’t remember it. It seems like the onehe put on was darker than that.Barbara Davis, another witness at the Tippit slaying, stated the killer wore “adark coat . . . it looked like it was maybe a wool fabric . . . more of asporting jacket” and cabdriver William Scoggins also failed to identify Oswald’sjacket, saying, “I thought it was a little darker.”Despite these problems of identification, the Commission went right on assertingthat the jacket belonged to Oswald.The Commission dissembled about the discovery of the jacket. The Warren Reportstated, “Police Capt. W. R. Westbrook . . . walked through the parking lotbehind the service station and found a light-colored jacket lying under the rearof one of the cars.” However, in his testimony, Westbrook was asked if he foundsome clothing. He replied, “Actually, I didn’t find it—it was pointed out to meby . . . some officer.” According to the Dallas police radio log, a “whitejacket” was found by “279 (Unknown)” a full fifteen minutes before Westbrookarrived on the scene. The Commission made no effort to determine who reallyfound the jacket, if a jacket was actually found, or if it was a white jacketthat only later was transformed into Oswald’s gray jacket.The owner of the Texaco station where the jacket reportedly was found told Texasresearchers that no one—not the FBI, the Dallas police, or the WarrenCommission—ever questioned him or his employees about this important piece ofevidence.In addition, the jacket identified by federal authorities as belonging to Oswaldcarried inside a laundry mark “30 030” and a dry-cleaning tag “B 9738.” Afull-scale search by the FBI in both Dallas and New Orleans failed to identifyany laundry or dry cleaner using those marks.Oswald’s wife, Marina, testified she could not recall her husband ever sendinghis jackets to a cleaning establishment, but that she did recall washing themherself. Further investigation by the FBI turned up no laundry or dry-cleaningtags on any of Oswald’s other clothing.With all this, plus a broken chain of evidence, the jacket cannot be consideredevidence of Oswald’s guilt in the killing of Officer Tippit.Then there is a matter of time and a strange incident at Oswald’s lodging.Earlene Roberts, Oswald’s landlady, told the Warren Commission she was watchingtelevision coverage of the assassination about 1 p.m. when Oswald—who had beenregistered at the rooming house as O. H. Lee—hurried in and went to his room.She said soon after this, a Dallas police car pulled up in front of her houseand honked. She explained, “I had worked for some policemen and sometimes theycome by. . . . I just glanced out, saw the number [on the car]. . . . It wasn’tthe police car I knew . . . and I ignored it.” She said the police car wasdirectly in front of her home when the driver sounded the horn, like “tit-tit.”She said the car then “just eased on . . . and they just went around the cornerthat way [indicating Zang Boulevard].”According to Roberts, there were two uniformed policemen in the car, mostunusual since daytime patrols in that area of the city were limited to oneofficer—such as Tippit. She could not recall the number of the car precisely,but said she did recall that the first two numbers of a possible three-digitcombination were a 1 and a 0. Tippit was driving car number 10 that day andfailed to respond to a dispatcher call at the approximate time of the police-carincident.Immediately following the departure of the police car, Roberts said Oswald cameout of his room and left hurriedly, zipping up a jacket. She said he left herhouse three or four minutes after 1 p.m.Roberts said she looked out the window and last saw Oswald standing at a nearbybus stop at Zang Boulevard.According to the Warren Commission, a man used Tippit’s police radio microphoneat 1:16 p.m., saying, “Hello police operator . . . We’ve had a shooting here . .. it’s a police officer, somebody shot him.” This, of course, referred toTippit, who lay dead next to his patrol car about a mile from Oswald’s NorthBeckley residence.The Commission tried to establish that the Tippit shooting occurred momentsafter 1:15 p.m., hardly enough time to allow Oswald to run from his roominghouse to the scene of the Tippit slaying at 10th and Patton. The Commissioncould not locate even one witness who saw Oswald walking or running between hisrooming house and the scene of the Tippit slaying. None have been found to thisday.This time frame becomes stretched to the breaking point when one considers theTippit witnesses’ testimony. Even Helen Markham, who was so confused about othermatters, was certain of the time because she was on her way to catch her usual1:12 p.m. bus for work. Asked by a Warren Commission attorney about the time shesaw the Tippit shooting, Markham responded, “I wouldn’t be afraid to bet itwasn’t six or seven minutes after one.”In this instance, Markham’s recollection must be correct since another Tippitshooting witness, Jack Ray Tatum, told researchers that Markham did not want toremain at the scene because she feared missing her bus for work.T. F. Bowley, the man who called the police dispatcher, was never called totestify to the Warren Commission. The reason may be that Bowley heard shots, sawTippit’s body lying next to his squad car, and looked at his watch. It was 1:10p.m.Other witnesses hid at the sound of the shots, afraid the gunman would turn onthem. Only after the killer fled did they venture out. One of the first to reachTippit was Domingo Benavides, who told the Warren Commission he was in a truckacross the street from the shooting. After hearing only three shots, Benavidessaid:I sat there for just a few minutes. . . . I thought maybe [the killer] had livedin there [the house where he last saw the gunman] and I didn’t want to get outand rush right up. He might start shooting again. . . . That is when I got outof the truck and walked over to the policeman. . . . The policeman, I believe,was dead when he hit the ground.After checking on Tippit, Benavides said, he tried to call on the patrol car’sradio but got no answer. Another bystander, Bowley, then got in the car and wassuccessful in raising the police dispatcher and reported the shooting.Obviously several minutes went by between the time of the shooting and 1:16p.m., when the police radio log recorded the citizen’s alert. This places theactual shooting closer to Bowley’s time of 1:10 p.m.—a time frame that rules outthe possibility that Oswald could have traveled on foot from his rooming houseto the scene of the shooting.The conversations of police regarding time sequences, orders, discovery ofevidence, and so on were recorded on Dallas police radio recording equipment.These recordings should have provided accurate times and movement orders—infact, the Warren Commission and subsequent investigations relied on themgreatly.Today, there is evidence that there may have been tampering with the Dallaspolice radio recordings. Soon after the assassination, the tapes may have beentaken by federal authorities, who certainly have access to the mostsophisticated audio equipment. Any police broadcasts not consistent with thelone-assassin theory could have been simply edited out and an altered copyreturned to Dallas police for conveyance to the Warren Commission.Is there any evidence that this occurred? Yes. Dr. James Barger, chief acousticscientist for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, studied the“original” police tapes and discovered a break in the sixty-cycle hum backgroundtone. He found two separate tones on the tape, which could result only fromcopying.Although ignored publicly, the Ramsey panel, appointed by the National Academyof Sciences to review the acoustical studies of the House committee, did suggestin an appendix of its report that “the original Dictabelt could be studied moreextensively for possible evidence . . . of being a copy.”Gary Mack reported that in recent years, former Dallas police sergeant J. C.Bowles, the radio-room supervisor who prepared transcripts for the WarrenCommission, stated that a few days after the assassination, federal agents“borrowed” the original police Dictabelt and at the time he was under theimpression that they took the tapes to a recording studio in Oklahoma.Like the Zapruder film and so much of the Warren Commission’s prime evidence,the Dallas police radio recordings are now open to question.The House Select Committee on Assassinations supported the Warren Commission’sconclusion that Oswald killed Tippit; however, it obliquely indicated that allis not known about the killing.Committee investigators studied information developed by researcher Larry Harristhat Tippit may have been killed as the result of personal problems. They alsotalked with yet another witness who had not been interviewed by the WarrenCommission. Jack Ray Tatum told committee investigators that Tippit’s killer,after shooting the officer from the sidewalk, walked toward the patrol car andshot Tippit once in the head at point-blank range. Correctly, the committeenoted, “This action, which is often encountered in gangland murders and iscommonly described as a coup de grace, is more indicative of an execution thanan act of defense intended to allow escape or prevent apprehension.”There is a problem with Tatum’s story, however. Most of the witnesses statedthat four shots were fired in succession—with no interval between the shots.Some serious students of the Tippit incident now believe that his death may havehad no connection with the Kennedy assassination. And of the researchers whostill believe such a connection exists, few cling to the belief that Oswald wasthe killer.But the key objection to the idea that Oswald killed Tippit is that he wasencountered inside the Texas Theater both before and during the Tippit slaying.[images/line.jpg]Regardless of who actually killed Officer Tippit, that event was the catalystthat set off a flurry of police activity in Oak Cliff resulting in the arrest ofLee Harvey Oswald.Prior to his arrest, there were at least two incidents in which police wereobviously seeking a suspect. Sometime after 1 p.m., a number of policemenstormed the Oak Cliff branch of the Dallas Public Library. One was heard to say,“He’s not here!” Unable to locate who they were looking for, they quickly left.Oswald was a frequent visitor to that library. Then, shortly before being calledto the Texas Theater, the scene of Oswald’s arrest, police surrounded a churchnear the scene of the Tippit slaying in the belief that Tippit’s killer hadhidden there. However, before they could conduct a search of the building, theywere called to the Texas Theater.The Arrest of Oswald [Contents.html#rsec70]The arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald appears straightforward enough in the officialreports, but there are some strange aspects when viewed objectively.By 1:45 p.m. on November 22, 1963, the president of the United States had beenmurdered just seventy-five minutes earlier, and only about thirty minutesbefore, Officer Tippit had been shot down on an Oak Cliff street. Dallas policewere swarming like angry bees.A report came in to police dispatchers. It seemed a man had slipped into theTexas Theater without paying. Immediately carloads of officers, including onefederal agent and an assistant district attorney, converged on the theater.The report had been instigated by a shoe store manager named Johnny Brewer.Brewer was listening to the radio when he learned of the Tippit murder. Hearingpolice sirens, he looked out the window of his store and saw a man duck into hisdoorway as a police car went by. Believing this to be suspicious activity,Brewer watched the man continue up the street to the Texas Theater, where helost sight of him. Moments later, when Brewer asked the theater’s ticket sellerif she had sold a ticket to anyone, she replied she had not. Entering thetheater, Brewer learned that the concession stand operator, W. H. “Butch”Burroughs, had heard the front doors open but had seen no one enter the theaterlobby.Between the theater’s front doors and a second set of doors were stairs leadingto the balcony. Burroughs was convinced that whoever entered had gone up to thebalcony since no one had passed his concession stand. Brewer asked the ticketseller to call police while he and Burroughs unsuccessfully looked for thesuspicious man.The authorities arrived quickly. Several policemen went to the theater’s rearexit and waited with drawn guns. Inside, police, including sergeant Gerald Hill,who had commanded the search of the sixth floor of the Texas School BookDepository, turned up the house lights and moved to the front of the theater.Officer M. N. McDonald had come in the rear door and was standing at the side ofthe movie screen. In an article written the day after the assassination for theAssociated Press, McDonald recalled:I noticed about 10 to 15 people sitting in the theater [which seated 900] andthey were spread out good. A man sitting near the front, and I still don’t knowwho it was, tipped me the man I wanted was sitting in the third row from therear of the ground floor and not in the balcony [as reported to the policedispatcher]. I went up the aisle and talked to two people sitting about in themiddle. I was crouching low and holding my gun in case any trouble came. Iwanted to be ready for it. I walked up the aisle and turned in Oswald’s row. Wewere no more than a foot from each other when he suddenly stood up and raisedboth hands. “It’s all over now,” he told me. Then he hit me a pretty good one inthe face with his fist. I saw him going for his gun and I grabbed him around thewaist. We struggled and fell around the seats for a few seconds and I got myhand on the butt of his pistol. But he had his hand on the trigger. I waspulling the gun toward me and I heard the hammer click. The primer [whichdetonates the bullet] was dented and it didn’t fire. . . . I’m sure glad thatshell didn’t fire.McDonald’s account of Oswald’s gun misfiring was confirmed to the WarrenCommission by theater patron John Gibson.But in his testimony to the Warren Commission, Brewer never mentions speaking toMcDonald. In fact, he said he was standing by a rear exit when he was grabbed bya couple of policemen and asked what he was doing there. Brewer told them he wassuspicious of a man in the theater. Brewer continued:And I and two or three other officers walked out on the stage and I pointed himout, and there were officers coming in from the front of the show . . . andofficers going from the back. . . . I saw this policeman approach Oswald andOswald stood up and I heard some hollering, I don’t know exactly what he said,and this man hit Patrolman McDonald. . . . I didn’t know his name [McDonald],but I had seen him quite a few times around Oak Cliff.Was the sitting man who tipped off McDonald to Oswald’s location Johnny Brewer?Apparently not, since Brewer stated he was standing and then on stage withseveral policemen. Brewer also never mentioned talking to McDonald, whom he saidhe recognized from around Oak Cliff. Who then was the man who tipped offMcDonald to Oswald’s location?Brewer also told the Commission that as Oswald struggled with police, he heardone of the officers cry, “Kill the president, will you?”If members of the police department somehow knew that Oswald was anassassination suspect at this time, it is strong evidence that something wasgoing on behind the scenes. The Warren Commission, while not contradictingBrewer’s account, nevertheless felt compelled to add, “It is unlikely that anyof the police officers referred to Oswald as a suspect in the assassination.”George J. Applin, one of only two theater patrons questioned by the WarrenCommission, told the Commission he was watching the movie when the lights cameon and a policeman with a rifle or shotgun began moving down his aisle. Applinsaid he was sitting in the downstairs middle aisle about six rows from the backwhen the commotion began. He moved down the aisle to ask what was going on, whena policeman (apparently McDonald) passed him moving toward the rear. Applin thenwitnessed Oswald’s arrest.At the close of his Warren Commission testimony, Applin said:But, there is one thing puzzling me . . . and I don’t even know if it has anybearing on the case, but there was one guy sitting in the back row right where Iwas standing at, and I said to him, I said, “Buddy, you’d better move. There isa gun.” And he says—just sat there. He was back like this. Just like this. Justwatching. . . . I don’t think he could have seen the show. Just sitting therelike this, just looking at me.Applin told Commission attorney Joseph Ball twice he didn’t know the man, but in1979, he told a news reporter that two days later, following the Oswald slaying,he recognized the man as Jack Ruby. Applin told the Dallas Morning News:At the time the Warren Commission had me down there at the Post Office in Dallasto get my statement, I was afraid to give it. I gave everything up to the pointof what I gave the police there in town. . . . I’m a pretty nervous guy anywaybecause I’ll tell you what: After I saw that magazine where all those peoplethey said were connected with some of this had come up dead, it just kind ofmade me keep a low profile. . . . [Jack] Ruby was sitting down, just watchingthem. And, when Oswald pulled the gun and snapped it at [McDonald’s] head andmissed and the darn thing wouldn’t fire, that’s when I tapped him on theshoulder and told him he had better move because those guns were waving around.He just turned around and looked at me. Then he turned around and startedwatching them.Yet more questions have been raised by recent statements of concession standoperator Burroughs. In a 1987 interview with this author, Burroughs, who thenhad become assistant manager at the Texas Theater, reiterated his story ofsomeone slipping in the theater about 1:35 p.m. that day. However, Burroughsclaimed that it could not have been Oswald because Oswald entered the theatershortly after 1 p.m. Burroughs said Oswald entered only minutes after thefeature started, which was exactly at 1 p.m.He said several minutes later, about 1:15 p.m., the man later arrested by policeand identified as Oswald came to his concession stand and bought some popcorn.Burroughs said he watched the man enter the ground floor of the theater and sitdown next to a pregnant woman. About twenty minutes after this, the outsidedoors opened and Johnny Brewer arrived.Several minutes after the man—identified by Burroughs as Oswald—took his seat,the pregnant woman got up and went upstairs, where the ladies’ restroom waslocated, said Burroughs. He said he heard the restroom door close shortly beforeDallas police began rushing into the theater.Burroughs said, “I don’t know what happened to that woman. I don’t know how shegot out of the theater. I never saw her again.”The story of Oswald being in the Texas Theater at the time of the Tippitshooting is further supported by Jack Davis, who went on to host Gospel MusicSpotlight on a Dallas Christian radio station.Davis told this author that on the day of the assassination, he went to theTexas Theater to see the war movies. The eighteen-year-old Davis found a seat inthe right rear section of the theater and recalled seeing the opening credits ofthe first film, which occurred a few minutes past the 1 p.m. starting time forthe feature movie.He said he was somewhat startled by a man who squeezed past him and sat down inthe seat next to him. He found it odd that this man would choose the seatadjacent to him in a nine-hundred-seat theater with fewer than twenty patrons init. Davis said the man didn’t say a word but quickly got up and moved across theaisle and took a seat next to another person. Then shortly, the man got up andwalked into the theater’s lobby. A few minutes later, Davis, whose attention hadreturned to the movie, vaguely remembered seeing the same man enter the centersection of the theater from the far side.Twenty minutes or so after this incident, according to Davis, the house lightscame on and when he walked to the lobby to ask why, he saw policemen running inthe front door. He recalled:I was looking for the manager, but I never got to say anything because thepolicemen all came rushing past me. I did not see what went on in the theater,but I heard some scuffling going on. A few minutes later the police brought outthis same man who had sat down next to me. He was shouting, “I protest thispolice brutality!” Later, of course, I learned that this was Lee Harvey Oswald.If Oswald was already in the theater at the time of the Tippit slaying asclaimed by Burroughs and Davis, then who slipped in about 1:35 p.m.?Since it can be established that someone was impersonating Oswald in Dallasbefore the assassination, it is reasonable to suggest that someone besidesOswald lured police to the Texas Theater. But if this were the case, whathappened to the man who slipped in without buying a ticket? Initial policereports stated the suspect was in the theater’s balcony, this informationperhaps coming from Burroughs’s belief that the man who sneaked in wentupstairs.The Dallas police homicide report on J. D. Tippit of that day stated, “Suspectwas later arrested in the balcony of the Texas Theater at 231 W. Jefferson.” Aseparate arrest report also stated Oswald’s arrest took place in the balcony.Was someone else arrested in the Texas Theater? Not according to the officialrecord. However, there is now evidence that perhaps another man was taken fromthe rear of the theater.Bernard J. Haire owned Bernie’s Hobby House, located two doors east of the TexasTheater on West Jefferson.On November 22, 1963, Haire, who was unaware of the assassination, saw thestreet in front of his business fill up with police cars. He went outside andsaw a crowd gathered at the Texas Theater but could not see what was happening.Haire was captured at the rear of the crowd in at least one photograph takenwhen Oswald was brought from the theater by police.Haire walked through his store and went into the alley, which he said was alsofilled with police cars. Walking toward the theater, Haire was opposite the reardoor when police brought a young white man out. He said the man was dressed in apullover shirt and slacks and appeared to be flushed as if having been in astruggle. Although Haire was unable to see whether the man was handcuffed, hewas certainly under the impression that the man was under arrest. Haire watchedpolice put the man in a patrol car and drive off.For nearly twenty-five years Haire believed he had witnessed the arrest of LeeHarvey Oswald. He was shocked to discover that Oswald had been handcuffed andbrought out the front door of the theater. He commented, “I don’t know who I sawarrested.”Neither does anyone else, but it is eloquent testimony that apparently someoneother than Oswald led police to the Texas Theater and someone other than Oswaldshot Tippit.[images/line.jpg]The arrested Oswald was taken from the Texas Theater shortly before 2 p.m. anddriven downtown to police headquarters. He was quickly taken to the third-flooroffice of captain Will Fritz, the crusty chief of the Homicide Bureau, andplaced in a seat in the hallway.Detective Guy Rose was already busy interviewing assassination witnesses. Hesoon took charge of Oswald. Rose recalled:I took the man to an interrogation office. I removed his handcuffs. I asked himto identify himself. He refused. In his pockets I found two pieces ofidentification. One card was for Lee Harvey Oswald, the other was for AlekHidell. “Which are you?” He said, “You’re the cop. You figure it out.” He toldme a lot of lies. Captain Fritz called me out at some time near 2:20 p.m. Hesaid that the employees of the Texas School Book Depository were accountedfor—except one. He told me to get some men together and get out to this addressin Irving. I asked what the man’s name was. He said, “Lee Harvey Oswald.” I wasstunned. “Captain,” I said, “I think this is Oswald, right in there.”With a suspect in custody, the entire complexion of the assassinationinvestigation changed.Despite what was heralded as overwhelming proof of Oswald’s guilt in bothkillings, it was not until late Friday, November 22, 1963, that he was chargedwith the murder of Officer Tippit. And it was well after midnight before he wasreportedly charged with the murder of President Kennedy.Dallas police and federal authorities quickly lost interest in any information,evidence, or detained suspects that did not fit in with the presumed activitiesof Lee Harvey Oswald.Yet many puzzling aspects continued to crop up in the aftermath of theassassination. There were reports of a man seen with a rifle near Cobb Stadium,located on the Stemmons Freeway route from downtown to the Trade Mart. Nothingcame of this report.At Redbird Airport, a private field located just south of Dallas, it wasreported that federal officials seized a plane with its engine running theafternoon of the assassination and placed it in a closed hangar under tightsecurity. Two days before the assassination, the airport’s manager, WayneJanuary, said three men talked to him about renting an airplane on November 22to fly to Mexico. He said one of the men remained sitting in a car and closelyresembled Lee Harvey Oswald. None of these stories regarding possible escapeplans were properly investigated.It is clear that someone was impersonating Oswald and if this “Oswald” did notleave Redbird, how did that person get out of Dallas?The answer perhaps may be found in the 2008 book by James W. Douglass, JFK andthe Unspeakable. Here Douglass recounts the story of Air Force Sergeant RobertG. Vinson, a staff member of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) whoby happenstance hitched a ride on an unmarked military transport plane fromWashington to his home in Colorado. Vinson soon found himself flying overmid-America all alone in the C-54 transport. At one point an unemotional voicecame over the plane’s radio stating, “The president was shot at 12:29.” Thecraft suddenly banked left and headed south, arriving some time later in Dallas,a city with which Vinson was familiar. Vinson was surprised when the plane madea sudden landing on a dirt strip near the Trinity River and picked up two men,who sat near him without saying a word. The taller of the pair, both wearingbeige coveralls, appeared to be Latino, a Cuban perhaps, while the second manwas a nondescript young white male. The transport, which had never turned offits engines, immediately took off in a westerly direction.Just after dusk, Vinson said, they landed at Walker Air Force Base at Roswell,New Mexico, which Vinson was told was closed and under alert. A few hours later,Vinson was able to continue his trip home. Watching the constant news coverageof the assassination, he was shocked to realize the man he saw get on thetransport in Dallas was Lee Harvey Oswald. “He’s in jail,” Vinson’s wife argued,adding, “Keep quiet about it.” Vinson did keep quiet even after being assignedto CIA projects, apparently in an effort to keep him under surveillance andcontrol. Finally, his conscience prompted Vinson to tell his story to a TV newsreporter in 1993 and eventually write down his account in a book published in2003. Needless to say, Vinson’s story never garnered national media attention.But if doubts remained in Dallas as to Oswald’s guilt, there were none inWashington. Less than two hours after the assassination—at a time when Dallaspolice were not even certain of the identity of the man they had in custody, FBIDirector Hoover called Robert Kennedy. In a bureau document released to thepublic in 1977, Hoover wrote, “I called the attorney general at his home andtold him I thought we had the man who killed the President down in Dallas.”Hoover went on to describe Oswald as an ex-Marine who had defected to Russia, aprocommunist and a “mean-minded individual . . . in the category of a nut.” Thisincident raises the troubling question of how Hoover could have had all thisinformation on Oswald at a time when the Dallas authorities were not evencertain of their prisoner’s identity.On November 24, less than two hours after Oswald was killed in Dallas, Hoovertelephoned the Johnson White House, saying, “The thing I am most concerned about. . . is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald isthe real assassin.”In 1976 a Senate Select Committee report stated, “Almost immediately after theassassination, Director Hoover, the Justice Department and the White House‘exerted pressure’ on senior Bureau officials to complete their investigationand issue a factual report supporting the conclusion that Oswald was the loneassassin.”Over the assassination weekend, information on—and evidence against—Oswaldcontinued to pile up. The news media was on around-the-clock alert. No bit ofinformation was too insignificant to broadcast or publish.The Dallas Morning News of November 23, 1963, carried a story stating:[District Attorney Henry] Wade said preliminary reports indicated more than oneperson was involved in the shooting which brought death to the President andleft Gov. John Connally wounded. . . . “This is the most dastardly act I’ve everheard about,” Wade said. “Everyone who participated in this crime—anyone whohelped plan it or furnished a weapon, knowing the purposes for which it wasintended—is guilty of murder under Texas law. They should all go to the electricchair.”But Wade’s initial claim of evidence of a conspiracy was quickly dropped asofficial statements began to center more and more on Oswald. Years later, Waderecalled why:Cliff Carter, President Johnson’s aide, called me three times from the WhiteHouse that Friday night. He said that President Johnson felt any word of aconspiracy—some plot by foreign nations—to kill President Kennedy would shakeour nation to its foundation. President Johnson was worried about someconspiracy on the part of the Russians. Oswald had all sorts of connections andaffections toward Castro’s Cuba. It might be possible to prove a conspiracy withCuba. But it would be very hard to prove a conspiracy with Russia. Washington’sword to me was that it would hurt foreign relations if I alleged aconspiracy—whether I could prove it or not. I would just charge Oswald withplain murder and go for the death penalty. So, I went down to the PoliceDepartment at City Hall to see Captain Fritz—to make sure the Dallas policedidn’t involve any foreign country in the assassination.With an ever-growing pile of evidence of conspiracy in the assassination, thefederal government began to assert itself as early as the afternoon of theassassination.The FBI Takes Control [Contents.html#rsec71]What criminal wouldn’t like to gain complete, secret, and unsupervised controlover all the evidence in his case for two full days? Wouldn’t the verdict in hiscriminal trial be a swift “not guilty” if he had the opportunity to “doctor” theevidence?This is exactly the situation that occurred in the murder of President John F.Kennedy beginning the very day of the assassination. Although the proof of thedisappearance and reappearance of the JFK evidence has been lying right in frontof researchers since the fateful weekend, no one seems to have perceived thesignificance of the matter. However, at least one person with access to officialfederal government documents apparently recognized this significance and tooksteps to conceal it from the public.This issue began the evening of November 22, 1963, when Dallas police chiefJesse Curry began receiving calls from Washington. Curry told the WarrenCommission:The FBI actually had no jurisdiction over [the murder of Kennedy], the SecretService actually had no jurisdiction over it. But, in an effort to cooperatewith these agencies we went all out to do whatever they wanted us to do. . . .We kept getting calls from the FBI. They wanted this evidence up in Washington .. . there was some discussion, [Captain] Fritz told me, he says, “Well, I needthe evidence here, I need to get some people to try to identify the gun, to tryto identify this pistol and these things, and if it’s in Washington, how can Ido it?” But, we finally . . . about midnight of Friday night, we agreed to letthe FBI have all the evidence.As he related to Warren Commission member Allen Dulles, “We kept getting callsfrom the FBI. They wanted this evidence up in Washington, in the [FBI]laboratory, and there was some discussion.” Curry made it clear that “we feltthis was a murder that had been committed in the county, city and county ofDallas, and that we had prior, I mean we had jurisdiction over this.But someone in Washington was most persistent. “We got several calls insistingwe send this [evidence], and nobody would tell me exactly who it was that wasinsisting, ‘Just say I got a call from Washington, and they wanted this evidenceup there,’ insinuated it was someone in high authority that was requesting this,and we finally agreed as a matter of trying to cooperate with them, actually,”explained Curry. Rumors in Dallas have long been that the calls were made byPresident Lyndon B. Johnson’s assistant Cliff Carter.On the basis of this pressure from Washington and against their better judgment,the Dallas police reluctantly released all of the assassination evidence to theFBI. “We finally, the night, about midnight of Friday night, we agreed to letthe FBI have all [emphasis added] the evidence and they said they would bring itto their laboratory and they would have an agent stand by and when they werefinished with it to return it to us,” stated Curry.However, much of the evidence was never returned to Dallas. Curry told theWarren Commission on April 22, 1964, “Subsequently they photographed thesethings in Washington and sent us copies, some 400, I think 400 copies ofdifferent items. So far as I know, we have never received any of that evidenceback. It is still in Washington, I guess. Perhaps the Commission has it.”“Yes; the Commission is still working with it,” responded Commission generalcounsel J. Lee Rankin. According to Fritz, what the Dallas authoritieseventually received was “very poor reproductions of some of these items onmicrofilm.”Yet the journey of this vital evidence was unofficial and was never made clearto the public. The first official word on the transfer of assassination evidencecame on Tuesday, November 26, when both Dallas newspapers carried storiesannouncing that the evidence was to be turned over to federal authorities.“The Dallas Police Department Tuesday prepared to turn over all evidence in theassassination case against Lee Harvey Oswald to the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation,” stated the Dallas Times Herald. “FBI agents Tuesday took controlof all evidence gathered by Dallas police against accused assassin Lee HarveyOswald on an agreement between Police Chief Jesse E. Curry and Dist. Atty. HenryWade,” announced the Dallas Morning News.The News went on to explain, “Curry went before reporters at noon Tuesday tomake the announcement. The disclosure came after Curry held several morningconferences with top aides. The transfer of evidence from city police to federalcontrol was completed four hours later.”So now the FBI was officially on the case and officially in charge of theevidence. But what could have happened during the two days while the evidencewas unofficially in their hands? Fabrication, substitution, elimination,alteration—anything could have been done to the evidence, with no effectivechain of custody. Unlike in 1963, today the FBI has come under suspicion of poormanagement of evidence at best and downright falsification of evidence at worst.In the late 1990s, Frederic Whitehurst, who served as supervisory special agentin the FBI’s laboratory from 1986 to 1998, went public with charges that the labwas involved in ongoing deficiencies ranging from mishandling of evidence tofalsifying documents. His charges echoed those of researchers who have claimedsimilar activities with JFK assassination evidence.Under Hoover’s iron control, it would have been an easy matter for certainranking bureau officials to do with the evidence whatever they pleased.The fact that federal authorities had all the assassination evidence undercovert control for two days could go far in explaining the contradictions andquestionable conclusions of the official investigation. Apparently at least oneperson understood the gravity of this issue as there was an attempt to obscureit in the Warren Commission materials.In 1992, the National Archives made public the “confidential” deposition of FBIfingerprint expert James C. Cadigan. In his April 30, 1964, testimony to WarrenCommission attorney Melvin A. Eisenberg, the following exchange took placeduring routine questioning regarding fingerprint matters:MR. EISENBERG: Do you know why [Exhibit] 820 was not reprocessed or desilvered?MR. CADIGAN: I could only speculate.MR. EISENBERG: Yes?MR. CADIGAN: It may be that there was a very large volume of evidence beingexamined at the time. Time was of the essence, and this material, I believe, wasreturned to the Dallas Police within two or three days, and it was merely in myopinion a question of time. We have (sic) a very large volume of evidence. Therewas insufficient time to desilver it. And I think in many instances where latentfingerprints are developed they do not desilver it.MR. EISENBERG: Can you explain why the signature, “Lee H. Oswald” or “L.H.Oswald is apparent while the signature “A.J. Hidell” is not?MR. CADIGAN: Different inks.During this otherwise unremarkable questioning, Cadigan had inadvertently letthe cat out of the bag. He had declared to one and all that the FBI had a “largevolume” of assassination evidence only some of which was returned to the Dallaspolice. Later in his deposition, Cadigan made it absolutely clear when thisevidence was being handled:MR. CADIGAN: Initially the first big batch of evidence was brought into thelaboratory on November 23rd of 1963 and this consisted of many, many items.MR. EISENBERG: `63?MR. CADIGAN: November 23, 1963. It was a very large quantity of evidence thatwas brought in. There were several agent examiners available to evaluate thismaterial. There were supervisory officials, there were representatives from ourInternal Security Division, all of whom had an interest in this matter, and itwas decided they wanted certain items treated for latent fingerprints.So a virtual posse of ranking FBI officials swarmed over the assassinationevidence all day Saturday and Sunday. Obviously this unpublicized andunmonitored access to all the evidence might cause a suspicious mind to questionthe validity of the evidence later used to establish Oswald’s guilt.It is doubly suspicious that in Cadigan’s original deposition some unknownperson scratched out his statement about being rushed to return the evidence toDallas and scribbled “delete” in the margin. This same person marked outCadigan’s statement that “I could only speculate” and wrote in “No, this is alatent fingerprint matter.”Sure enough, in the version published by the Warren Commission, we read:MR. EISENBERG: Do you know why Exhibit 820 was not reprocessed or desilvered?MR. CADIGAN: No, this is a latent fingerprint matter.MR. EISENBERG: Can you explain why the signature, “Lee H. Oswald” or rather“L.H. Oswald” is apparent, while the signature “A.J. Hidell” is not?MR. CADIGAN: Different inks.Why did someone commit a crime by illegally altering an official governmentdeposition and why did the Warren Commission print an altered version ofCadigan’s statement. Were they unaware of the alteration? Or did someonerecognize the significance of the assassination evidence being in the hands ofthe FBI with no publicity or accountability for two days?Perhaps a study of the stenographic notes and tapes might reveal otheralterations to the testimony of Cadigan and others. But don’t count on it.According to a notice on the cover sheet of Cadigan’s deposition, “StenotypeTape, Master Sheets, Carbon and Waste turned over to Commission fordestruction.”The assassination had become a federal government matter, and although theassassination evidence is often ambiguous and contradictory and will certainlybe in controversy for years to come, the handling of the evidence clearly pointsto manipulation and obfuscation at the highest levels of federal authority,clear proof of who was responsible for at least the demonstrable cover-up, ifnot the assassination itself.[images/line.jpg]The next major shock came about 11:20 a.m. Sunday, November 24, 1963, when theprime suspect was fatally shot while handcuffed in the basement of Dallas policeheadquarters.Five days later, Lyndon Johnson moved to block any further investigation of thecurious events in Dallas by appointing a “blue ribbon” commission to probe theentire affair. It was the beginning of total federal control over the evidenceand witnesses in the assassination case. The key to the JFK assassination may bein the aftermath of the crime—the unfollowed leads, the presence of SecretService agents—real or bogus—in Dealey Plaza where none should have been, theintimidation of witnesses, the destruction and suppression of vital evidence.As with any good investigation dealing with criminal violence, much of the workin the first hours after the assassination centered on the medical evidence,which should have clearly shown how many bullets struck Kennedy and from whichdirection they came.Therefore, on the day of the assassination, attention was centered on twohospitals—Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and Bethesda Naval Hospital nearWashington, DC."},{"pageContent":"Two Hospitals [Contents.html#rch12]As the echo of shots died away in Dealey Plaza, Dallas police chief Jesse Curry,riding in the lead car of Kennedy’s motorcade, radioed his police dispatcher,“Looks like the president has been hit. Have Parkland stand by.”The motorcade sped up, reaching speeds of nearly eighty miles per hour duringthe four-mile race along Stemmons Freeway to the hospital.Parkland Memorial Hospital remains the major public hospital in Dallas Countytoday. Almost every victim of violence—from wrecks to gunshot wounds—is broughtto Parkland. Its emergency room is constantly staffed with doctors and internswell experienced in trauma situations. President Kennedy could not have askedfor more experienced and competent medical attention.Yet following his autopsy that evening at the National Naval Medical Center atBethesda, Maryland, serious and continuing discrepancies in the medical evidencearose. These discrepancies have provided a source of controversy that continueseven today.If one assumes there was some sort of conspiracy involved in the assassination,the questions over the medical evidence provide a good starting point fordetermining its scope.But before examining the tangled morass of medical evidence, there is a smallquestion of the presidential limousine’s arrival at Parkland. Secret Servicedriver William Greer testified to the Warren Commission that he did not know theway to Parkland and so followed sheriff Bill Decker and Chief Curry in the leadcar. Greer’s story is buttressed by the testimony of two other Secret Serviceofficials, Forrest Sorrels and Winston Lawson. However, in his testimony, ChiefCurry is strangely vague, saying only that the limousine went to the hospitalunder “siren escort.”What’s the problem? During the time of the House Select Committee onAssassinations, a film taken by Dallasite Jack Daniel was seen widely for thefirst time. Taken just as the motorcade exited from the west end of the TripleUnderpass and entered Stemmons Freeway, this film clearly shows that both thepresidential limousine and the Secret Service backup car had passed Curry’s leadcar and were leading the race to the hospital.How could Washington-based Agent Greer know how to find Parkland and, moreimportant, why did he state in his Commission testimony, “I never passed[Curry’s car]. . . . I was led to the hospital by the police car who waspreceding me”?Either these highly trained agents panicked and forgot what actually happened orthey lied about it. Since the Daniel film can’t lie, the question remains—howdid Greer know how to locate Parkland?Upon arrival at Parkland at 12:35 p.m., Governor Connally regained consciousnesslong enough to attempt to rise, but fell back into the car in great pain.Connally was lifted onto a stretcher and wheeled into the hospital. SecretService agent Clint Hill removed his suit coat and placed it over thepresident’s gory head wound to prevent photographs.However, several persons saw Kennedy’s body, including Fort Worth newsman RoyStamps, who told researchers, “I rushed up and saw Kennedy lying in the car onhis side. His foot was hanging over the side of the car. The back of his headwas gone.”As other vehicles in the presidential motorcade began arriving at the Parklandemergency entrance and Connally was placed in Trauma Room 2, Secret Serviceagents Greer, Roy Kellerman, and Winston Lawson pulled the fatally woundedpresident away from Mrs. Kennedy, placed him on a stretcher, and pushed it intoTrauma Room 1. There Kennedy was attended to by no fewer than twelve ofParkland’s doctors—including four surgeons, the chief neurologist, an oralsurgeon, and a heart specialist.Dr. Charles J. Carrico, a resident surgeon, was the first doctor to examineKennedy. He noted the president was ashen in color, his breathing lackedcoordination, there were no voluntary movements, and his eyes were open withpupils dilated, showing no reaction to light. However, a few chest soundsthought to be heartbeats were heard and immediately resuscitation efforts werebegun. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube in a small puncture woundjust below Kennedy’s Adam’s apple. The tube was connected to a respirator.Other doctors began arriving and treating the president; fluids and stimulantswere injected and oxygen administered. Cardiac massage was begun—to no avail.President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1 p.m. (CST) by Dr. Kemp Clark,Parkland’s director of neurological surgery.Dr. Charles A. Crenshaw, who retired as chairman emeritus of the Department ofSurgery at Fort Worth’s Peter Smith Hospital and a director of the TarrantCounty Hospital District, was among the team that worked to save the president.In 1992, he was vilified by the Journal of the American Medical Association(JAMA) after publicly stating that Kennedy was shot from the front and that theDallas doctors had engaged in a “conspiracy of silence” concerning his wounds.The publication even suggested that Crenshaw was never in Parkland’s emergencyroom. He noted:My observations contradicted the “official” version of the assassination, asreported in the Warren Report. I stated that President Kennedy was shot at leastonce, and I believe twice, from the front, and Oswald could not have been a“lone gunman.” I had anticipated criticism from some, but I never expected thevicious attack from my medical colleagues.A retraction and financial settlement were later given by JAMA when it waspointed out that five doctors and nurses had mentioned Crenshaw’s presence intheir Warren Commission testimony.Crenshaw also raised official ire when he related how he received a call fromLyndon Johnson while trying to save the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. PhyllisBartlett, chief telephone operator for Parkland Hospital, recalled, “The callcame in and said ‘hold the line for the President,’ and for a second I was stillthinking Kennedy, and I . . . was kind of taken aback for a minute and a fewseconds. It was just a matter of a second, that’s when he came on in a loudvoice and said, ‘This is Lyndon Johnson. Connect me to the accused assassin’sdoctor.’ It sounded the same as it had been on newscasts when I would hear himspeak.”Crenshaw said Johnson told him, “Dr. Crenshaw, I want a death-bed confessionfrom the accused assassin. There’s a man in the operating room who will take thestatement. I expect full cooperation in this matter.”Crenshaw said the incident confounded logic and bothered him for the rest of hislife. “Why the President of the United States would get personally involved inthe investigation of the assassination, or why he would take the inquest out ofthe hands of the Texas authorities was perplexing,” he mused.While one set of Parkland doctors worked on Kennedy, another worked feverishlyto save Connally. A large sucking chest wound caused the greatest concern forthe governor. A bullet had shattered the fifth rib on his right side, sendingbits of bone and metal tearing through his chest, collapsing one lung. And hisright wrist had been broken, the bullet entering from the top and exiting fromthe bottom of his wrist. Doctors also discovered a wound in Connally’s leftthigh. This wound was cleaned and sutured shut, although according to the WarrenReport, “a small metal fragment remained in the Governor’s leg.”Vice president Lyndon Johnson also had entered Parkland, but was kept secludedin a room near where efforts were being made to revive the president. About 1:20p.m., presidential aide Kenneth O’Donnell informed Johnson that Kennedy wasdead. According to the Warren Report, O’Donnell advised Johnson to return toWashington as soon as possible. However, Mrs. Kennedy refused to leave withouther husband’s body and Johnson refused to leave without Mrs. Kennedy.It was finally decided to leave immediately and to return on Air Force Onebecause the presidential plane had better communication equipment. The decisioncreated one of the assassination’s most enduring problems—with the president’sautopsy performed at Bethesda, two sets of doctors viewed the body at differenttimes and their descriptions of wounds differed so widely that controversyremains to this day.The president’s death was legally a Texas homicide and by law, the body couldnot be removed until after an autopsy or a coroner’s ruling, which would haveinvolved further medical investigation. Dallas County medical examiner Dr. EarlRose, who died in 2012 at age eighty-five, tried to block the efforts of SecretService agents trying to remove Kennedy’s body from Parkland. But after someshouting, including profanities and, by some accounts, even drawn weapons, Rosewas forced to step aside. In 2003, Rose told the Associated Press he and hisstaff should have conducted an examination as required by law. “We had theroutine in place to do it and it was important for the chain of evidence toremain intact. That didn’t happen when the body was taken to Bethesda,” heexplained.Totally against prevailing law and despite the protest of Texas officials, acoffin was ordered from O’Neal Funeral Home and Kennedy’s body was whisked awayfrom Parkland Hospital. Ambulance driver Aubrey Rike told this author that eventhough his ambulance was on standby at Parkland, his boss, Vernon O’Neal,arrived with an expensive bronze casket into which Kennedy’s body was placed.Government agents then drove off in the newly arrived ambulance leaving bothO’Neal and Rike standing at the hospital’s loading dock. Both men then climbedinto Rike’s ambulance and trailed the first ambulance to Love Field. Rike saidthere were no stops.After Kennedy’s body left Parkland and while Dallas doctors worked on Connallyin a second-floor operating room, another incident occurred in the hospital thatwas to have long-reaching effects on the official theory of the assassination—ahospital worker discovered a bullet in a hallway.During the feverish activity in the emergency room, the hospital’s seniorengineer, Darrell C. Tomlinson, was asked to manually operate an elevator thatconnected the ground-floor emergency room to the second-floor operatingtheaters. It was Tomlinson who found an intact bullet, which became the keyexhibit of the Warren Commission.Despite efforts by Warren Commission attorney Arlen Specter to confuse the issueduring testimony, Tomlinson was remarkably clear on what had happened that day.Tomlinson stated that one hospital stretcher containing two rolled-up bloodysheets, some surgical instruments, and some sterile packs was sitting against awall near the elevator.No effort apparently was made by the Commission to determine the true origin ofthis stretcher. Some researchers believe it may have held Kennedy’s body whilein the emergency room. But this is extremely doubtful since Kennedy’s bodyremained on his stretcher until the Dallas casket arrived about 1:40 p.m. Atthis time, his body was placed in the casket and the stretcher was stripped ofsheets and rolled across the hall to Trauma Room 2, according to nurse DianaBowron. Since Tomlinson claimed to have discovered a bullet at this same timeand two nurses reported placing Kennedy’s empty stretcher in Trauma Room 2, itis virtually impossible to believe that the hallway stretcher carried thepresident.Today, it is more likely that this stretcher was used in treating two-year-oldRonald Fuller, who entered the Parkland emergency room at 12:54 p.m. with a badcut on the chin. The child’s mother, Mrs. Ross Fuller, years later told theDallas Morning News what happened:I was watching the President’s parade on television when they announced he hadbeen shot. I knocked over the bottle of soda pop I was drinking and it brokeinto pieces. My little boy Ronnie fell on it and started bleeding badly. Myhusband and I ran to the car and headed for Parkland with the baby.Mrs. Fuller finally reached the Parkland emergency room and handed her son tomedical personnel. Then she fainted. She recalled, “When I came to, they told meRonnie was all right. They were sewing him up. Then they told me the Presidentwas dead. It happened in the cubicle right next to us. The doctor said I wasliving a part of history.”The Fuller child was briefly placed on a stretcher and his cut was treated withsutures and gauze packs, which could have been left behind on the cart.Considering both the condition—bloody sheets, instruments, sterile packs—and thelocation of Fuller’s stretcher—the child originally was placed on a stretcher inthe same hallway leading to Trauma Rooms 1 and 2—it is most likely thisstretcher on which the bullet was found.Tomlinson said a second stretcher was on the elevator—perhaps the one thatcarried Connally to the second-floor operating room—and that he pulled it outand placed it near the first stretcher. Specter designated the stretcher pulledoff the elevator as stretcher A and the stretcher already in the hall near theelevator (Fuller’s?) as stretcher B.After making a few trips in the elevator, Tomlinson said one of the stretcherswas moved away from the wall so he could enter a men’s restroom. Tomlinson toldSpecter as he pushed the stretcher back up against the wall to clear thehallway, “I bumped the wall and a spent cartridge or bullet rolled out thatapparently had been lodged under the edge of the mat.” “And that was from whichstretcher?” asked Specter. “I believe that it was B,” replied Tomlinson.Later in his testimony, Specter tried to shake Tomlinson’s recollections.Specter asked, “And at the time we started our discussion, it was yourrecollection at that point that the bullet came off of stretcher A, was it not?”“B,” Tomlinson quickly responded.Finally, after Specter continued to confuse the matter by telling Tomlinson thathe had identified stretcher A during a Secret Service interview, the hospitalworker said:I really don’t remember. I’m not accustomed to being questioned by the SecretService and the FBI and by you and they are writing down everything, I mean . .. I’m going to tell you all I can, and I’m not going to tell you something Ican’t lay down and sleep at night with either.From Tomlinson’s testimony, it appears more than likely that the stretcherholding the bullet did not belong to Connally. But this would be evidence ofplanted evidence, which would mean an accomplice to the assassination—aconspiracy. Therefore, the Warren commissioners, while acknowledging Tomlinson’suncertainty, nevertheless concluded that the intact bullet came from Connally’sstretcher. “That conclusion is buttressed by evidence which eliminated PresidentKennedy’s stretcher as a source of the bullet,” they explained, closing off anysuspicion that the slug might have come from anywhere else.It was this bullet—Commission Exhibit 399—that became the foundation of thesingle-bullet theory of the assassination. It has also been called the “magicbullet.”Tomlinson turned the bullet over to Parkland’s chief of security, O. P. Wright,who gave it to Secret Service agent Richard Johnsen.Interestingly, Wright was the father-in-law of Dallas police sergeant Patrick T.Dean, the officer blamed by the Warren Commission for allowing Jack Ruby intothe police department basement just before Oswald’s slaying. Dean’smother-in-law, Mrs. O. P. Wright, was director of nursing at Parkland and onduty when Kennedy was being treated.Neither Wright nor Agent Johnsen were interviewed by the WarrenCommission—perhaps because, in later interviews with researchers, neither mancould positively identify Commission Exhibit 399 as the bullet found that day.Oddly, Tomlinson never was asked to identify Commission Exhibit 399.In fact, during a 1966 interview with author Josiah Thompson, Wright, aprofessional security officer, picked a pointed-tip bullet shape as more nearlylike the bullet discovered at Parkland. He rejected round-nose bullet shapessimilar to Commission Exhibit 399. Likewise, Tomlinson selected a pointed shapeas resembling the bullet he found.The whole bullet matter becomes even more clouded when the possibility ofsubstitution and planting is considered. The hallway in which both stretchers Aand B were left unattended was a public corridor and neither stretcher belongedto either Kennedy or Connally. Although the Warren Commission apparently neverconsidered that Commission Exhibit 399 may have been planted on one of thestretchers or later substituted for the found bullet, these possibilities findfavor in the minds of assassination researchers.Adding to this suspicion is the presence of Jack Ruby at Parkland Hospital whileKennedy’s body was still there.Jack Ruby at Parkland [Contents.html#rsec72]Veteran newsman Seth Kantor told the Warren Commission that he encountered JackRuby at Parkland Hospital about the time Kennedy’s death was publicly announced.Kantor said he and Ruby even shared a brief conversation. Kantor recognizedRuby, having worked in Dallas for some years. He said he spoke to Ruby at 1:30p.m. and recalled that Ruby asked if he should close his club out of respect forthe slain president.When asked about his presence at Parkland, Ruby denied ever being there, and theCommission chose to believe him and concluded that Kantor must have beenmistaken.Ignored by the Commission were FBI interviews with a Dallas woman whoseexperiences on the day of the assassination fully supported Kantor’s account ofhis Parkland meeting with Ruby. Wilma Tice was home when she heard the news ofthe Dealey Plaza shooting. Curious, she drove to Parkland Hospital, arrivingabout 1:30 p.m., and joined the throng of bystanders awaiting word on thepresident’s condition.Some months later, she told the FBI she stood beside a heavily built man in adark suit who was hitting his hat against his leg. She was only three or fourfeet from the man when another man approached him and said, “How are you doingthere, Jack?” She said the two men had a brief conversation during which the mannamed Jack offered to donate a kidney to John Connally.Two days later Tice was astounded to see the man called Jack on televisionidentified as Jack Ruby, the slayer of Oswald. However, she assumed that theauthorities knew about his presence at Parkland and did not notify anyone untillate in the spring of 1964.Tice had telephoned Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant, to express her condolences overRuby’s death sentence when she mentioned her encounter at Parkland and learnedthat Ruby had denied being there. It was at this point that Tice contacted theFBI and told her story.On April 12, 1964, she received a call from a man claiming to be a newspaperreporter. He asked about her Parkland encounter and then advised her not to talkabout the incident. On July 19, Tice received a letter asking her to testify forthe Warren Commission. The next day she received an anonymous call from a manwho warned her, “It would pay you to keep your mouth shut.”On July 22, Tice called police because someone tried to break into her homewhile her husband was away. This incident was followed by other phone calls, butshe had a fourteen-year-old niece answer the phone and the caller would hang up.The account of Ruby at Parkland has been further supported in recent years byformer radio newsman Roy Stamps, who said he had met Ruby on about forty-fiveoccasions before November 22, 1963. Stamps told Texas researchers that he was inthe hall of Parkland holding open a telephone line to his radio station when henoticed Ruby enter the hospital. He said Ruby was carrying some televisionequipment and trailing behind a TV crew.In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reversed the WarrenCommission’s decision that Kantor was mistaken about his Parkland meeting withRuby, stating, “While the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken,the Committee determined he probably was not.”With the presence of Ruby in Parkland plus the lack of firm identification, thepossibility that Commission Exhibit 399 was planted appears more than likely.Of course, virtually anyone could have planted the bullet, since the stretcherin question sat unattended in the public hallway for some time. But even if thebullet were not planted—and there is some evidence to suggest that a bullet slugmay have worked its way out of Kennedy’s back wound—there is also thepossibility that Commission Exhibit 399 was substituted for the bullet found onthe stretcher. There is even the possibility that Commission Exhibit 399represented an entirely different bullet, a suggestion strengthened by JohnConnally, who wrote in 1993:But the most curious discovery of all took place when they rolled me off thestretcher and onto the examining table. A metal object fell to the floor, with aclick no louder than a wedding band. The nurse picked it up and slipped it intoher pocket. It was the bullet from my body, the one that passed through my back,chest, and wrist, and worked itself loose from my thigh. . . . I have alwaysbelieved that three bullets found their mark. What happened in the hospitaldemonstrated how easily a bullet could have been swept aside and lost.But this extraneous bullet was not lost. According to several reports, it wasgiven by the nurse to Texas highway patrolman Bobby Nolan, who said he turned itover to Captain Will Fritz. From that point onward, it was in the hands offederal authorities. Of course, if bullets were switched, it could have beendone only while in the hands of authorities—a most ominous suspicion.[images/line.jpg]After Kennedy’s body was returned to Air Force One at Love Field, Lyndon B.Johnson was sworn in as thirty-sixth president of the United States by federaljudge Sarah T. Hughes.On the plane flight back to Washington, it seems the original destination forKennedy’s body was to have been Walter Reed Army Hospital—long the majormilitary medical facility for Washington. Examining US Army Signal Corpstranscripts of radio messages from Air Force One that day, researchers havefound several references indicating that military officers were going to sendthe body to the Army hospital. General Chester Clifton, senior military aide,radioed:This is Gen. Clifton. We do not want a helicopter to go to Bethesda MedicalCenter. We do want an ambulance and a ground return from Andrews to Walter Reed,and we want the regular post-mortem that has to be done by law under guardperformed at Walter Reed. Is that clear?Even the official history of the 1001st Air Base Wing, which included Air ForceOne, reported, “The body of the slain President was removed to Walter ReedGeneral Hospital.”Why the sudden change to Bethesda?Kennedy’s personal physician, Dr. George G. Burkley, wrote in his report of thatday:During the course of the flight [back to Washington], determination of theimmediate action on arrival in Washington was made to assure complete compliancewith Mrs. Kennedy’s wishes. I spoke to her while kneeling on the floor so Iwould be at the level of her face rather than leaning forward, and expressedcomplete desire of all of us and especially of myself to comply with her wishes,stating that it was necessary that the President be taken to a hospital prior togoing to the White House. She questioned why and I stated it must be determined,if possible, the type of bullet used and compare this with future materialfound. I stated frankly that I had no preference that it could be any hospital,but that I did feel that, if possible, it should be a military hospital forsecurity measures. The question was answered by her stating that she wanted thePresident taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital.Oddly, having just received Mrs. Kennedy’s wishes, Dr. Burkley then added,“Arrangements were made on the ground for departure to Walter Reed Army Hospitalor Bethesda Naval Hospital, as the case may be.”Why such confusion over military hospitals? Was Mrs. Kennedy’s natural desire totake her husband, a former naval officer, to the naval hospital an unexpectedhitch in a plan for an autopsy at Walter Reed?It certainly appears that Bethesda was not prepared for this most importantautopsy. The three military physicians who performed Kennedy’s autopsy wereclinical pathologists with little experience in gunshot wounds. Neither NavyCommander James J. Humes nor Navy Commander J. Thornton Boswell had practical,firsthand experience with bullet wounds. Army Lieutenant Colonel Pierre Finckdid have some such experience, but he later said he was hampered in his autopsyprocedures by officials in the room. The military autopsy doctors apparentlywere surrounded by both military and civilian superiors who directed much of theautopsy—some of this direction contrary to normal autopsy procedures.During the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans, Dr. Finck was asked under oath if Dr.Humes had been in charge of the president’s autopsy. He replied:Well, I heard Dr. Humes stating that—he said, “Who’s in charge here?” And Iheard an Army general, I don’t remember his name, stating, “I am.” You mustunderstand that in those circumstances, there were law-enforcement officers,military people with various ranks, and you have to coordinate the operationaccording to directions.An unnamed Army general in charge? Directions to the doctors? Finck continued todescribe the scene:The autopsy room was quite crowded. It is a small autopsy room, and when you arecalled in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President of theUnited States who is dead, you don’t look around too much to ask people fortheir names and take notes on who they are and how many there are. I did not doso. The room was crowded with military and civilian personnel and federalagents, Secret Service agents, FBI agents, for part of the autopsy, but I cannotgive you a precise breakdown as regards the attendance of the people in thatautopsy room at Bethesda Naval Hospital.New Orleans executive assistant district attorney Alvin Oser then pressed Finckon why, as an autopsy pathologist, he had not tracked the bullet wound throughKennedy’s body to determine its exact path.After dodging the question for a time, Dr. Finck finally was ordered by thecourt to answer Oser’s question. Dr. Finck stated, “As I recall I was told notto, but I don’t remember by whom.” “Could it have been one of the admirals orone of the generals in the room?” asked Oser. “I don’t recall,” said Dr. Finck.Finck, the only member of the autopsy team who was a member of the AmericanAcademy of Forensic Sciences, asked to examine Kennedy’s clothing—a normal andacknowledged autopsy procedure. His request was denied.Further, the autopsy doctors were ordered not to talk about what they had seenin the autopsy room. Finck again:When you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at theend of the autopsy, we were specifically told—as I recall it, it was by Admiral[Edward C.] Kenney, the surgeon general of the Navy . . . not to discuss thecase.In 1977 Dr. Humes appeared before a medical panel gathered by the House SelectCommittee on Assassination. Because of long-standing questions concerning thepossibility that Kennedy suffered from Addison’s disease (which can be detectedby studying the adrenal glands), Humes was asked about the glands by committeemedical panel member Dr. Charles Petty “because normally we examine adrenals inthe general course [of an] autopsy, as we undertake it.” Humes replied:Since I don’t think it bore directly on the death of the President, I’d prefernot to discuss it with you, doctor. . . . I’d only comment for you that I havestrong personal reasons and certain other obligations that suggest to me that itmight not be preferable.Certain other obligations? To whom?But for all the puzzles and the directions of superiors, Humes had come to somedefinite conclusions by the end of the autopsy.—One bullet entered the rear of Kennedy’s head and exited from the top of hisskull.—Another bullet entered the president’s back and apparently worked its way outduring cardiac massage at Parkland.The autopsy, which began at 8:15 p.m. the evening of the assassination, wasconcerned with only two of Kennedy’s wounds. Humes studied the head wound andfound about forty pieces of bullet metal, indicating a bullet had fragmentedwhile passing through the skull area. He concluded that a high-velocity riflebullet had entered the rear of the skull, fragmented, and then exited throughthe top of the skull. Death was attributed to the head wound.Not so easily explained was a wound in the president’s back. The Dallas doctorssaid they never saw this wound because they never examined Kennedy’s back.However, the autopsy doctors studied this wound carefully and wrote clearrecords of it. On the autopsy face sheet diagram marked by Dr. Humes, a wound isdepicted in Kennedy’s back between the shoulder blades.Kennedy’s death certificate states, “A second wound occurred in the posteriorback at about the level of the third thoracic vertebra.” The third thoracicvertebra is located almost midway between the shoulder blades.Two FBI agents, Francis X. O’Neill Jr. and James W. Sibert, were ordered toattend the autopsy and make a report. Their report, which the Warren Commissionkept classified for several years, said, “During the latter stages of thisautopsy, Dr. Humes located an opening which appeared to be a bullet hole whichwas below the shoulders and two inches to the right of the middle line of thespinal column.”This description on the wound’s location was supported by the testimony ofSecret Service agents and bullet holes in Kennedy’s clothing. Yet it presented areal problem to the Warren Commission. If the president’s wound was between theshoulder blades, this was lower than the position of the neck wound, making foran upward trajectory—totally inconsistent with shots fired from sixty feet aboveand behind the president.The solution to this dilemma was simple—the Commission simply reported the backwound as located five and a half inches higher than determined by the evidence.They reported, “A bullet had entered the base of the back of [Kennedy’s] neckslightly to the right of the spine. It traveled downward and exited from thefront of the neck, crossing a nick in the left lower portion of the knot in thePresident’s necktie.”Later, when questioned about the location of the wound as marked on the autopsyface sheet, Dr. Boswell stated the drawing was a “diagram error.” And Humes wasquoted as saying the back wound was higher than the throat wound, although hehad marked it well below the neck wound.The issue of the autopsy diagram was resolved in 1975 when researcher HaroldWeisberg obtained the original autopsy face sheet through a Freedom ofInformation Act suit.Researchers discovered that the original diagram—depicting a wound in the lowback—had been marked “verified” by Kennedy’s personal physician, Dr. GeorgeBurkley. This verification of the autopsy sheet had been eliminated in copies ofthe document presented by the Warren Commission to the public. Curiously, Dr.Burkley was never called to testify to the Commission, although he was the onlymedical authority who rode in the motorcade, viewed Kennedy’s body at ParklandHospital, and was present at the autopsy. In 1982, Burkley reportedly toldauthor Henry Hurt that he believed Kennedy’s death was the result of aconspiracy. However, Burkley declined to elaborate further.This issue became more understandable in 1997 with the release of documents fromthe Assassination Records Review Board, which discovered Warren Commissiondocuments showing that commission member—and America’s only appointedpresident—Gerald R. Ford told the authors of the Warren Report to change theirwording before issuing the report. The writers correctly had written, “A bulletentered his [Kennedy’s] back at a point slightly below the shoulder to the rightof the spine.” Ford “suggested” they change this wording to “a bullet hadentered the back of his neck slightly to the right of the spine.” Ford’s wordingwas adopted and the final report stated, “A bullet had entered the base of theback of his neck slightly to the right of his spine.”Ford explained to the Associated Press, “My changes had nothing to do with aconspiracy theory. My changes were only an attempt to be more precise.” However,critics such as Robert Morningstar pointed out this allowed for thesingle-bullet theory and claimed, “This is the most significant lie in the wholeWarren Commission Report.”The Sibert-O’Neill FBI report further stated:This opening [the back wound] was probed by Dr. Humes with the finger, at whichtime it was determined that the trajectory of the missile entering at this pointhad entered at a downward position of 45 to 60 degrees. Further probingdetermined that the distance traveled by this missile was a short distanceinasmuch as the end of the opening could be felt with the finger. Inasmuch as nocomplete bullet of any size could be located in the brain area and likewise nobullet could be located in the back or any other area of the body as determinedby total body X rays and inspection revealing there was no point of exit, theindividuals performing the autopsy were at a loss to explain why they could findno bullets.Commander J. Thornton Boswell, Humes’s assistant, told author Josiah Thompsonthat all three doctors probed the back wound with their fingers but could notpenetrate past an inch or so. According to Boswell, a thin metal probe also wasused but no bullet track could be located.After failing to find any bullet, agents Sibert and O’Neill called the FBIlaboratory and were informed of the bullet that had been found on a stretcher atParkland Hospital. This information was relayed to Humes and the autopsy doctorsand led them to a conclusion expressed in Sibert and O’Neill’s FBI report:“Since external cardiac massage had been performed at Parkland Hospital, it wasentirely possible that through such movement the bullet had worked its way backout of the point of entry and fallen on the stretcher.”At the end of the autopsy, the military doctors concluded, as recorded in theSibert-O’Neill report, “The one bullet had entered the President’s back and hadworked its way out of the body during external cardiac massage and that a secondhigh-velocity bullet had entered the rear of the skull and had fragmentizedprior to exit through the top of the skull.”But if the back wound caused problems, they were nothing compared to theproblems that arose after Humes learned that the autopsy doctors had completelymissed one of the president’s wounds.On the day after the autopsy—with the president’s body already prepared forburial and lying in state at the White House—Humes contacted the medicalofficials in Dallas. He was shocked to learn that they had observed a bulletwound in Kennedy’s throat. The autopsy doctors had noticed an opening in thethroat but had assumed it had been made at Parkland to facilitate a trachealtube.Here is one of the most suspicious of the differences recorded in Kennedy’swounds: Dr. Perry at Parkland described the throat wound as a small hole aboutthree to five millimeters—or about one-fifth of an inch—in diameter that had theappearance of an entrance wound. He reiterated this size in interviews in 1966,1989, and 1998, although he backed off somewhat from his description of anentrance wound after being ordered to change his testimony by Dallas SecretService agent Elmer Moore, who explained years later that he was acting “onorders from Washington and Mr. Kelly of the Secret Service Headquarters.”Perry said he made a surgical incision laterally across this hole to facilitatea tracheotomy, but did not obliterate the bullet wound. But by the time theautopsy doctors examined Kennedy’s throat, this wound had elongated to almostthree inches—such a gash that they didn’t realize it obliterated a wound fromthe assassination. Furthermore, all of the Dallas doctors said Kennedy had alarge blasted hole in the right rear portion of his head—not at all like thegaping wound in the right top portion of his skull as reported by the autopsies.These differences in the descriptions of the throat and head wounds suggest onlythree explanations: 1. The Dallas medical personnel lied about what they saw. 2. The autopsy doctors lied about what they saw. 3. No one lied—thus indicating the wounds were altered between the timethey were seen in Dallas and the autopsy.The latter explanation is buttressed by the Sibert-O’Neill FBI report of theBethesda autopsy, which states:The President’s body was removed from the casket . . . and placed on the autopsytable, at which time the complete body was wrapped in a sheet and the head areacontained an additional wrapping which was saturated with blood. . . . It wasalso apparent that a tracheotomy had been performed, as well as surgery of thehead area, namely, in the top of the skull.Surgery in the top of the skull? No such surgery was ever mentioned by theParkland medical staff.This oddity became one of the focal points of an investigation by researcher andauthor David Lifton, who reached some startling and well-publicized conclusions.The Switching of Bodies [Contents.html#rsec73]David Lifton, a former NASA computer engineer who researched the assassinationfor more than fifteen years, was the first person to interview both medicalpersonnel in Dallas and at Bethesda Naval Medical Center. What he discoveredshocked him.In his best-selling 1980 book, Best Evidence, Lifton reported that there werediscrepancies not only in the descriptions of Kennedy’s wounds, but also inreports of how the body was transported.It has been well documented how Kennedy’s body was wrapped in a sheet in Dallasand placed in an expensive bronze ceremonial casket for shipment to Washington.Yet Lifton found Bethesda technicians who said they removed Kennedy’s body froma black zippered body bag that was inside a cheap, gray military-style shippingcasket, similar to those used to transport bodies back from Vietnam.Paul K. O’Connor, who was studying to be a medical technician, was working inBethesda’s laboratory when Kennedy’s body arrived. He said the body arrived in a“shipping casket . . . kind of slate-type gray and a kind of light pinkish coloron the edges.” Asked by Lifton the condition of the body when the casket wasopened, O’Connor replied, “He was in a body bag.” O’Connor’s recollection wasconfirmed by others, including Captain John Stover, Bethesda’s commandingofficer.Just as startling was an interview with Bethesda X-ray technician Jerrol F.Custer. He said he had already made X-ray photographs of Kennedy’s body, hadgone to an upper floor to process them, and was returning to the morgue area ofthe hospital when he encountered a bloodstained Jacqueline Kennedy, surroundedby news reporters and Secret Service agents, entering Bethesda. Outside in anambulance was the bronze Dallas casket supposedly containing the president’sbody.By 1992, not only Custer but also Floyd Riebe, who took autopsy photographs,were disclaiming that evidence in the National Archives. In a news conferencecalled to rebut articles published by the American Medical Association (AMA),Custer stated that X-rays presented by the AMA showed a hole on the right sideof Kennedy’s face indicating that portion was destroyed. “There was no damage tohis face and no part of his skull was missing on the forward part of his head.”Custer concluded, “These are fake X-rays.” He added that later a Navy admiralthreatened him with prison if he spoke out regarding the autopsy.After pointing to dozens of autopsy photographs, Riebe announced, “These filmsare doctored one way or another. . . . [They are] phony and not the photographswe took.” As usual, this bombshell testimony from the technicians who actuallytook JFK’s X-rays and photographs received scant attention from the nationalmass media.Based on this and much more information gleaned from official reports andwitnesses, Lifton concluded that the assassination was the result of a plot“involving the Executive Branch of the Government.” His hypothesis was this:Since it was unbelievable that the doctors at both Parkland and Bethesda liedabout their observations, the alternative belief was that Kennedy’s body wasaltered. Lifton discovered a brief time period during the swearing-in ceremoniesfor Lyndon Johnson aboard Air Force One when everyone gathered forward, leavingKennedy’s body unattended. It was during this time that he believed JFK’s bodywas taken from the bronze Dallas casket, placed in a military body bag, andstowed elsewhere in the plane. [Autopsy photos showed several scratches onKennedy’s back that could be explained by the hasty handling of his body.] AtAndrews Air Force Base, Kennedy’s body was taken off the right side of Air ForceOne and placed in a helicopter, which immediately took off while the news mediaand officials concentrated on Mrs. Kennedy and the Dallas casket, which wereunloaded from the left side of the plane. Either at Walter Reed or Bethesda,someone altered the President’s wounds to conform to the shots-from-behindthesis and then the body was wrapped in a sheet and placed on the Bethesdaautopsy table ready for Dr. Humes and the others.This theory—incredible as it may seem—is supported by the available evidence.Attempts to discredit either Lifton or his sources have proven unconvincing.Some researchers suspect that alternatively the body may have been flownseparately to Washington in a military jet, arriving before the official party.In 2009, the chief analyst for military records for the 1990s AssassinationRecords Review Board published a five-volume set of books based on the mostrecent interviews and studies of the JFK autopsy. The autopsy was conducted bythe military at Bethesda Naval Hospital the night of the assassination and manyissues connected to it remain in controversy.Douglas P. Horne was meticulous and detailed in his accounts of obfuscation anddownright dissembling of autopsy statements and documents. His work, whichincluded the reinterviewing of autopsy observers, technicians, andphotographers, provided strong support for Lifton’s thesis.There is no doubt that long-standing and serious questions have arisen over themedical evidence. The idea that Kennedy’s body was altered while in the hands offederal officials, along with the knowledge that all assassination evidence wasillegally in the hands of the FBI for two full days with no chain of evidence,goes a long way in explaining the puzzles and inconsistencies of the medicalevidence.[images/line.jpg]Upon learning of the throat wound the day after the autopsy, Humes was forced torevise his autopsy report. The autopsy doctors determined that the back woundwas four to seven millimeters in diameter and the Dallas doctors said the throatwound was three to five millimeters in diameter. Since the back wound waslarger, this normally would suggest that the neck wound was one of entrance andthe back wound one of exit—assuming both holes represented the path of a singlebullet.However, Humes saw it another way. Testifying to the House Select Committee onAssassinations, Humes said upon learning of the throat wound, “Lights went on,and we said, ah, we have some place for our missile to have gone.”After revising his autopsy report, Humes walked to his fireplace and burnedautopsy material—alternatively described as original notes, a first draft, orother written notes. This highly questionable activity preceded his finalautopsy report, which stated definitively, “One missile entered the back of thePresident and exited in the front of the neck.”Considering that the wound in Kennedy’s throat was too small to have been causedby a rifle slug and that FBI experts could not find any traces of metal onKennedy’s shirt or tie and that the Dallas doctors noted bruises on Kennedy’sneck, it has been theorized that the neck wound may have been caused by bonefragments blasted downward at the time of the fatal head shot.Author Josiah Thompson wrote, “If we suppose that a bullet (or more likely abone) fragment was driven downward on a slight left-to-right trajectory throughthe midbrain, we have a hypothesis that accords with all the known factssurrounding the throat wound.”But Humes was not bothered by such theories. He now had a revised idea of howKennedy died:—One bullet entered Kennedy’s back and exited from his throat.—Another bullet struck the back of his head and exited from the top of theskull.Even Kennedy’s personal physician, Dr. Burkley, had problems accepting thesefindings, which may explain his belief in a conspiracy as revealed to authorHenry Hurt.Adding to this confusion is the possibility of yet another bullet beingrecovered from Kennedy’s body during the autopsy. In the New York Times ofNovember 27, 1963, Dallas doctor Kemp Clark stated one bullet struck Kennedy atthe necktie knot, “ranged downward in his chest, and did not exit.” Thisstatement was supported by Dr. Robert Shaw, who told New York Herald-Tribunereporter Martin Steadman on November 27 that a bullet entered the front ofKennedy’s throat, “coursed downward into his lung [and] was removed in theBethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was performed.”The idea of a bullet being removed during autopsy gains additional strength inlight of two government documents now available. One is a letter of receiptsigned by FBI agents Sibert and O’Neill, who monitored the autopsy. The two-lineletter, dated November 22, 1963, states, “We hereby acknowledge receipt of amissile removed by Commander James J. Humes, MC, USN on this date.” The other isanother letter of receipt, but this time from the Protective Research Section ofthe Treasury Department, dated November 26, 1963. Among the items it listed asreceived from Kennedy’s personal physician, Dr. Burkley, is “one receipt fromFBI for a missile removed during examination of the body.” FBI agents normallywould know the difference between bullet fragments and an intact slug. It iscurious that both documents refer to a “missile” rather than fragments or piecesof bullet.All of this suggests yet another bullet was discovered but kept secret, sinceanother bullet would have destroyed the lone-assassin theory, which already wasbeing strained to the limit.Further evidence that more than two bullets struck President Kennedy came in1968 when then–attorney general Ramsey Clark gathered a panel of physiciansheaded by Dr. Russell Fisher, a Maryland medical examiner, to study the JFKautopsy photographs and X-rays.In addition to noting that the rear head wound had changed both size and shapefrom its description by the autopsists, the Clark panel found at the base ofKennedy’s skull “a large metallic [bullet] fragment which . . . is round andmeasures 6.5 mm in diameter.”This could be construed as strong evidence against Lee Harvey Oswald, since hereportedly used a 6.5 mm rifle. However, recall that the official version statesthat one bullet—the “Magic Bullet”—traversed the president’s neck, penetratedConnally, and was found intact at Parkland Hospital.Since officially no large fragments had been noted by the autopsy doctors and nosuch fragments could have come from the whole bullet found at Parkland, it seemsprobable that either more than two shots struck Kennedy in the head area or thatthe autopsy materials viewed by the Clark panel were fraudulent.Furthermore, yet another bullet base, about 6.5 mm in diameter, was said to befound in the front seat of the presidential limousine. All this goes far toprove that more than two bullets struck Kennedy.A Navy officer who might have been able to clarify some of the questions aboutthe president’s autopsy is unavailable. Bethesda television technicianLieutenant Commander William Pitzer, according to Chief of the Day Dennis David,may have surreptitiously taken both film and photos of the autopsy andparticipants. David later said these materials depicted an entry wound inKennedy’s right temple area with a corresponding exit wound in the lower rightportion of the skull. In October 1966, Pitzer was found shot in the head underquestionable circumstances. The death was ruled a suicide due to self-inflectedpistol wound but no nitrates or gunpowder were found on his hand. Among otheroddities in the death was a claim in recent years by Special Forces ColonelDaniel Marvin that at that time he was approached by a CIA operative who wantedMarvin to “terminate” Pitzer.Over the years, as attempts have been made to clarify and substantiate themedical evidence, the wounds seem to take on a life of their own.The head wound as seen by the Dallas doctors consisted of a large blasted-outarea in the right rear of the skull. Both medical and nonmedical persons inDallas gave consistent descriptions of this wound.Secret Service agent Clint Hill told the Warren Commission, “The right rearportion of his head was missing.”Dr. Charles J. Carrico noted a large hole “in the posterior skull, the occipitalregion. There was an absence of the calvarium or skull in this area.”Dr. Malcolm Perry: “I noted a large avulsive wound of the right parietaloccipital area [the occipital is the large bone on the back of a human skull],in which both scalp and portions of skull were absent.”Dr. William Kemp Clark: “I then examined the wound in the back of thePresident’s head. This was a large, gaping wound in the right posterior part,with cerebral and cerebellar tissue being damaged and exposed.” (The cerebellumcontrols muscle coordination and is located at the low rear portion of the headbehind the occipital bone.)Dr. Robert McClelland: “I noted that the right posterior portion of the skullhad been extremely blasted.”Yet the autopsy doctors saw a head wound that stretched from the upper side ofthe rear to the right front of Kennedy’s head.The autopsy doctors said a small entrance wound was located in the back of theskull at about the hairline, while the House Select Committee on Assassinations’medical panel placed the entrance wound four inches higher, near the top of thehead.Neither the Warren Commission nor the House committee spoke of a hole blastedout of the right rear portion of the president’s head. The House committee evenproduced a drawing reportedly made from an autopsy photograph that depicts therear of Kennedy’s head. It is entirely intact except for what appears to be asmall hole—the entrance wound—near the top.Humes had problems with this drawing, stating he had never seen the small holebefore. He suggested it might be dried blood. His thought was confirmed laterwhen the actual photographs were released to the public. The photo clearlyshowed the hole as a spot of transparent dried blood with hair growing throughit. Humes was certain he had seen no entrance wound in that location.Robert Groden, photographic consultant to the House Select Committee onAssassinations, had a simple explanation for the mystery surrounding the autopsyphotographs. After careful study, he agreed with photographer Floyd Riebe thatthe autopsy photos now available to the public are forgeries. After discoveringevidence of retouching, Groden wrote:The vital autopsy photos of the back of the President’s head were alteredimmediately after the autopsy in order to cover up the fact that the Presidentreceived two bullets in the head, one from the rear and one from the front, andthis second shot blew out the back of his head, as Jackie Kennedy testified tothe Warren Commission.X-rays and other autopsy materials such as photographs, tissue samples, andblood smears—including Kennedy’s brain, which was removed and preserved—couldhave provided definitive proof of the location of the wounds. However, much ofthis material is missing from the National Archives. The House Select Committeeon Assassinations hinted that the brain may have been taken by Robert Kennedy toprevent future public display; however, this has not been proven and Kennedy isnot alive to answer the charge.It also should be noted that the Warren Commission—the group officially chargedwith finding the truth of Kennedy’s assassination—apparently never was allowedto view for themselves the president’s autopsy photographs and X-rays.Commission attorney Arlen Specter, in an October 10, 1968, interview in US News& World Report, stated:The complete set of pictures taken at the autopsy was not made available to meor to the Commission. I was shown one picture of the back of a body which wasrepresented to be the back of the President, although it was not authenticated.It showed a hole in the position identified in the autopsy report. To the bestof my knowledge, the Commission did not see any photographs or X-rays. . . . Thephotographs and X-rays would, in the thinking of the Commission, not have beencrucial, because they would have served only to corroborate what the autopsysurgeons had testified to under oath as opposed to adding any new facts for theCommission.But they are crucial—if not in truthfully understanding Kennedy’s wounds, thenin understanding the manipulations surrounding the medical evidence. Notstudying the autopsy materials did not dissuade Specter from formulating theconvoluted “single-bullet” theory.Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, an experienced coroner and former president of the AmericanAcademy of Forensic Medicine, was blunt. He stated:[Kennedy’s autopsy was] extremely superficial and sloppy, inept, incomplete,incompetent in many respects, not only on the part of the pathologists who didthis horribly inadequate medical-legal autopsy but on the part of many otherpeople. This is the kind of examination that would not be tolerated in a routinemurder case by a good crew of homicide detectives in most major cities ofAmerica.As Groden later wrote:The key to understanding who killed Kennedy lies with the autopsy photographs.These photographs may tell us more about the assassination than all of theofficial investigations. Perhaps the single most important question in theinvestigation was never asked: Why were the autopsy photographs and X-rays neverofficially shown to the numerous doctors and nurses in Dallas who treatedPresident Kennedy? Had this question been pursued, the true nature of theconspiracy would then have been exposed, because the crucial pictures allegedlyof the back of the President’s head are forged! That forgery is one of the keysto the conspiracy. Who would have had that kind of access to the evidence inorder to alter it? Who had the capability to alter it?"},{"pageContent":"Jack Ruby [Contents.html#rch13]On the day before Kennedy’s assassination there was a continuing parade ofdefendants, lawyers, and police officers in the Dallas County DistrictAttorney’s Office. One officer, Dallas police lieutenant W. F. Dyson, later toldthe Warren Commission that it was here that he and other officers encountered ashort, stocky nightclub owner who was going out of his way to make theiracquaintance. Dyson overheard this man—Jack Ruby—tell the officers, “Youprobably don’t know me, but you will.”The following Sunday the entire world knew Jack Ruby—the man who killed LeeHarvey Oswald.When on November 24, 1963, Ruby silenced the one man whom authorities blamed forKennedy’s death, a rumble of discontent and suspicion began that persists eventoday. Many people could accept the idea of a “lone-nut assassin,” but balked atthe idea of two such characters.In the months following the assassination, the American public was told—first bynews media accounts and then by the Warren Commission—that Ruby was a small-timeDallas nightclub operator with no significant ties to organized crime, to Dallasauthorities, or to Oswald. It was said that his killing of Oswald was simply thespontaneous act of a man hoping to right the wrong of the president’s death.Today there is evidence that Ruby, a fixture on the Dallas scene in 1963, wasmore intimately connected with organized-crime figures than earlier believed andthat he in fact stalked Oswald throughout the assassination weekend.Furthermore, the evidence of an association between Ruby and Oswald prior to theassassination is substantial.It also is now known that Ruby tried to tell what he knew about the plot to killKennedy but was shrugged off by both government investigators and the newsmedia. To a radio news reporter, Ruby said, “I know there is a terribleconspiracy going on in the world right now. . . . I’m speaking the truth. . . .The world has the right to hear the truth.”Shortly after Ruby was granted a new trial, he was filmed by a Texas televisionstation stating, “Everything pertaining to what’s happened has never come to thesurface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred—my motive, inother words. I am the only person in the background to know the truth pertainingto everything relating to my circumstances.”Asked by the interviewer if this truth would ever come out, Ruby replied, “No.Because unfortunately these people, who have so much to gain and have such anulterior motive to put me in the position I’m in, will never let the true factscome aboveboard to the world.”“Are these people in high positions?” asked the interviewer. Ruby answered,“Yes.” In letters smuggled out of the Dallas County Jail, Ruby even named LyndonJohnson as the person behind the assassination and called him a Nazi.Jack Ruby was born Jacob Rubenstein in 1911, the fifth of eight siblings. Hisexact birth date is not known. Various documents show different birth dates,although Ruby himself used March 25, 1911, most frequently. Despite severalmoves, the family always remained in what was described by one brother as a“ghetto,” complete with noisy streets filled with pushcarts and peddlers.When Ruby was ten years old, his parents separated and he, along with his threebrothers and four sisters, was placed in various foster homes by the Jewish HomeFinding Society. During this time, young Rubenstein was learning more on thestreets of Chicago than in the schoolroom. Like young Oswald, Ruby was caught bytruant officers after skipping school. Unlike Oswald, who found diversion in thelocal library and zoo, Ruby gravitated toward street gangs and amusement parks.On the streets, young Ruby was nicknamed “Sparky.” According to his sister EvaGrant, the name came from Ruby’s swaggering walk, which reminded some people ofthe wobbling gait of Sunday comic strip character Barney Google’s horse,“Sparkplug.” Others believed “Sparky” was a tag reflecting Ruby’s volatiletemperament.Young streetwise Sparky gained a reputation with his fists, although theaccounts of his aggressiveness differed with those who knew him. BarneyRasofsky, who gained fame in the 1930s as World Welterweight Boxing ChampionBarney Ross, in 1964 told the FBI that he and Ruby along with other young toughswere paid $1 per trip to deliver sealed envelopes for gangster Al Capone. Ifthis information was passed along to the Warren Commission, it was neverreported. Rasofsky also said Ruby was never a troublemaker, although he alwayswas ready to defend himself against any attack. Others, too, recalled Ruby asone to avoid a fight if possible. These recollections clash markedly with thoseof others who recalled Ruby as a street brawler, eager to take up any challenge,even to the extent of aiding someone else in trouble.Ruby was also militantly proud of his Jewish ancestry. Although not particularlydevout, he had nevertheless received some instruction in Orthodox Judaism. Inaddition to fights with other street gangs because of racial and ethnicdifferences, Ruby reportedly joined with Jewish toughs in fights with thepro-Nazi group the German American Bund during the late 1930s.In 1933 Ruby, along with several Chicago friends, went to Los Angeles and thenSan Francisco seeking employment. In 1936, he was still in San Francisco livingfor a brief time with his sister Eva and her husband.Despite some evidence to the contrary, Ruby later told authorities he returnedto Chicago in 1937—the same year his mother was committed to Elgin StateHospital with mental disorders. For more than twenty years, Fannie Rubensteinhad frequented doctors and clinics reporting that a fishbone was lodged in herthroat despite continuing reassurances that nothing organic could be detected.Having returned to Chicago about 1937, Ruby began working for the Scrap Iron andJunk Handlers Union, according to Social Security Administration records.Chicago attorney Leon R. Cooke, a close friend to Ruby, had founded the unionand was financial secretary. When gangsters connected to the Chicago underworldbegan taking control of the union and its funds, Ruby went along. Unionpresident John Martin, who earlier had been indicted along with a major Chicagomobster for withholding tax information, named young Rubenstein union secretary.However, according to a statement Ruby made to police at the time, he was littlemore than a bagman for union thugs.On December 8, 1939, Martin fatally shot Cooke in the union’s offices after anargument over missing funds. Martin fled and Ruby was arrested. The incident wassplashed all over the Chicago newspapers at the time. Although Cooke was shot inthe back, Martin claimed self-defense and never served time for the murder.While Ruby claimed such close friendship for the slain man that he eventuallytook the name Leon as his own middle name, he nevertheless stayed on with thecorrupt union after Cooke’s brutal murder.Following the bad publicity over Cooke’s killing, the union was reorganized asthe Waste Material Handlers Union, Local 20467, American Federation of Labor.Martin was replaced and the reorganized union was dominated by itssecretary-treasurer, Paul J. Dorfman, a man with long-standing connections toChicago racketeers.Several months after Dorfman took over, Ruby suddenly left the union. In 1964,Ruby told the Warren Commission, “I was with the union back in Chicago and Ileft the union when I found out a notorious organization had moved in there. . .. I have never been a criminal. . . . I am not a gangster. . . . I had a veryrough start in life, but anything I have done, I at least tried to do it in goodtaste.”By mid-1943, Ruby had found a permanent home—the US Army Air Corps. At thebeginning of World War II, he had been granted a draft deferment for reasons notentirely clear. One version is that he feigned a hearing disability by wearing ahearing aid, while another is that he was granted an “economic hardship”deferment because he was the only Rubenstein child remaining at home. Whateverthe reason, it was insufficient in 1943 when he was reclassified 1-A and,despite an appeal to his local board, inducted into the Army Air Corps on May21.Upon his discharge from the air force in February 1946, Ruby returned toChicago, where he entered an unsuccessful sales business with his threebrothers, Hyman, Sam, and Earl. As in their childhood, the four Rubensteinbrothers constantly argued with one another—this time over how to run thebusiness. One of the few things they agreed on was the need to obtain a more“American” name. After Hyman left the business, Sam, Earl, and Jack allshortened their name from Rubenstein to Ruby. Their stormy partnership lastedonly one year, and by 1947 Jack Ruby had left Chicago for Texas.Shortly after Jack arrived in Dallas his name change was made official by adecree from the 68th Judicial District Court of Dallas on December 30, 1947.Although the official story of Ruby’s move is that he went to help his sisteroperate a nightclub, several different sources—some within the mob—have claimedthat Ruby was part of a plan to bring Dallas rackets under the control of theChicago underworld. Shortly after the JFK assassination, Dallas businessmanGiles Miller added support for this idea by telling the FBI that in 1959 Rubyhad told him he wanted to go back to California in 1947 but “was directed” to goto Dallas.But further evidence of Ruby’s move as part of a mob offensive into Texas camefrom former Dallas County sheriff Steve Guthrie. During the late 1930s and1940s, Dallas gambling operations were virtually wide open under the control ofhomegrown bosses like Benny “Cowboy” Binion and Herbert Noble. However, by thelate 1940s a bloody feud between these two top gamblers had resulted in Noble’sbombing death and Binion’s departure for the quieter environs of Las Vegas. Itwas then that the Chicago mob made its bid for a takeover in Dallas.In late 1946, an emissary from the Chicago syndicate named Paul Roland Jonescontacted Dallas lawmen in an effort to open the city for the mob. Jones heldmeetings with Sheriff Guthrie and an obscure Dallas police lieutenant namedGeorge Butler. Jones said he was an advance agent of the Chicago crime syndicateand was prepared to offer the district attorney and the sheriff $1,000 a weekeach or a 12.5 percent cut on the profit if the syndicate were permitted tooperate in Dallas under “complete protection.” He also said local people would“front” for the Chicago mob. Sometime later Jones was indicted for attemptedbribery when Guthrie and Butler blew the whistle.At this time the two top Chicago mob leaders were Sam Giancana (the coordinatorof Mafia-CIA assassination plots) and Anthony Accardo.Was Ruby one of the “fronts” mentioned by his friend Jones? Sheriff Guthrie toldthe Warren Commission that Ruby was himself involved in the bribery plan ofJones and that both Jones and his Chicago associates “frequently mentioned thatRuby would operate a ‘fabulous’ restaurant as a front for gambling activities.”The Commission went on to state, however, that since Ruby was not mentioned inJones’s bribery scheme, the Commission “found it difficult to accept [Guthrie’s]report.” The Commission also ignored a story by Chicago newsman Mort Newman, whoreported that Butler told him that “Jack Ruby came to Dallas from . . . Chicagoin the late 1940s and was involved in an attempt to bribe Sheriff SteveGuthrie.”The Warren Commission also ignored testimony that showed that Jones met Rubythrough two mutual friends, Paul “Needle Nose” Labriola and Jim Weinberg—bothwell-known associates of Giancana.In fact, to arrive at their conclusion that Ruby was not connected to the mob,they had to ignore an FBI interview with Jones in which he stated that when hefirst met Ruby, both Weinberg and Labriola told him Ruby was “all right” as faras the syndicate was concerned. Weinberg and Labriola in 1954 were foundgarroted and stuffed in a car trunk in a double gangland slaying.When interviewed for the Warren Commission in 1964, Jones said he believedButler was serious about accepting mob payoffs, changing his position only afterlearning that the Texas Rangers had become aware of the deal.It was Butler—then assigned to the juvenile division—who was in charge of thefatal transfer of Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963. Butler apparently wasalso close to right-wing causes in Dallas. According to Penn Jones, formereditor of the Midlothian Mirror, Butler approached him in 1961 about publishingright-wing literature. Jones told this author, “[Butler] offered me the job ofprinting a regional newspaper under the auspices of the Ku Klux Klan. He told methat half of the Dallas police were members of the KKK.” Butler also was knownto have provided personal police security for right-wing Dallas oil billionaireH. L. Hunt.Butler’s veracity comes into further question when one considers CommissionExhibit 2249, which includes the statements of two Dallas policemen who claimedthat shortly after Ruby killed Oswald, Butler approached them with “important”information, namely that young Oswald was actually the illegitimate son of JackRuby. Some researchers have speculated that it was Butler who let Ruby into thepolice department basement to kill Oswald through a rear door leading to analleyway by the Western Union office.Whether or not Ruby participated in the 1947 bribe attempt, it is certain thathis relationship with Paul Roland Jones continued. On October 24, 1947, Joneswas arrested and charged with smuggling opium into the United States fromMexico. In Chicago, both Ruby and his brother Hyman were questioned by Bureau ofNarcotics agents investigating the case.And over the next two years, while Jones appealed his narcotics conviction, hefrequented Dallas’s Singapore Club, which by then was operated by Jack Ruby.Despite Jack Ruby’s ongoing gangster connections, the Warren Commission andsubsequent assassination investigations attempted to portray him as simply arambunctious, self-ingratiating nightclub owner striving for success in a rathershabby business—almost a Damon Runyan racetrack character.It may also be significant that Ruby was much better connected socially inDallas than federal investigations have publicly stated. As a man-about-town,Ruby was well-known not only to police and law-enforcement officials, but alsoto the city and county officials and businessmen who frequented his clubs andattended area gambling parties.One significant contact may be found in an account by Madeleine Brown, a formermistress to Lyndon Johnson. She claimed to have first met Jack Ruby throughJohnson attorney Jerome Ragsdale of Dallas. She told this author:One day in the early 1950s, I was coming out of Nieman-Marcus in downtown Dallaswhen I encountered Jerome Ragsdale and another man talking on the sidewalk. Theyseemed to be good friends and Jerome introduced me to the man, who was JackRuby. Ruby told me he owned a club downtown and invited me to visit. He alsogave me a card. Of course, later I saw Ruby frequently. A bunch of us would seehim around town. Lots of people in town knew him, especially people in thedowntown area like H. L. Hunt, Henry Wade, Earl Cabell, they all knew him. Butafter the assassination weekend, everyone was scared to say they knew him.According to Ester Ann Mash, a former employee who dated Ruby during the springof 1963, Ruby was no stranger at the homes of prominent Dallasites. She toldthis author, “Several times he took me to big nice homes where there wereimportant people in town, including District Attorney Henry Wade. I think heonly took me so he didn’t have to go alone. Once we got there, I never saw Jack.He would be off gambling.”But the record shows Ruby was a much more important criminal than previouslybelieved.Jack Ruby—Gangster [Contents.html#rsec74]From the prewar union murder of Leon Cooke to the 1963 killing of Lee HarveyOswald in Dallas, Jack Ruby’s life was one of close association with gangstersand close calls with the law.Consider these Ruby associates:Barney Baker: Described by Robert Kennedy as Jimmy Hoffa’s “roving organizer andambassador of violence,” Baker had moved from criminal activities involvingmobsters Jake Lansky and Bugsy Siegel to Teamster organizer for the CentralStates Conference under Hoffa. According to the Warren Commission, Bakerreceived at least two calls from Ruby in a three-week period preceding theassassination and Baker called Ruby on November 7, 1963. Three of Baker’s phonenumbers were found in Ruby’s notebooks.Joseph Campisi: An associate of Dallas Mafia member Joseph Civello, Campisioperated several businesses in Dallas, including a restaurant notorious as agangster hangout, and has been linked closely to the New Orleans Marcellofamily. Both Ruby’s sister Eva Grant and his business partner and roommate,George Senator, described Campisi as one of Ruby’s closest friends. And thoughtrying to distance himself from Ruby, Campisi himself told the FBI in December1963 he had been in contact with Ruby the night before the assassination and hadvisited Ruby in jail on November 30, 1963.Frank Caracci: Described by Life magazine as a “Marcello Mobster,” Caracci wasarrested by Houston police in 1969 with three members of the Marcello group wholater attended the Dallas wedding of Joseph Campisi’s son. One of these men wasFrank “Tickie” Saia, a prominent Louisiana gambling and political figure who wasclose friends with Senator Russell Long. In the months preceding the Kennedyassassination, Ruby met with Caracci at least once and was in telephone contacton several occasions.Frank Chavez: Another Teamster thug with arrests for obstruction of justice andattempted murder, Chavez told associates that in the fall of 1961 he had metwith Ruby and other Teamster officials, including Richard Kavner, whom authorDan Moldea described as “another key member of the Hoffa circle.” A JusticeDepartment memorandum also linked Ruby and Chavez to mobster Tony Provenzano.Joseph Civello: The Dallas Mafia chief who was one of those arrested at the 1957Apalachin, New York, mob meeting, Civello admitted to the FBI after theassassination that he had known Ruby “for about 10 years.” Like Campisi, Civellotried to downplay his close connections with Ruby, and someone within the WarrenCommission aided this effort by deleting an entire page covering Civello fromCommission Exhibit 1536 and by blanking out several paragraphs within thedocument.Mickey Cohen: A news reporter claimed that Ruby was acquainted with famedmobster Cohen through his girlfriend Candy Barr, a close friend of Ruby’s whohad been jailed on a narcotics charge earlier in the 1960s.Al Gruber: A former roommate of Ruby’s from Chicago, Gruber told the FBI he hadno mob connections. Yet in 1970, a two-page FBI report that had been suppressedfor years showed Gruber had been arrested six times using two aliases in threestates. Gruber, too, was associated with top Teamster officials as well as thugsworking for Mickey Cohen. Gruber reportedly had not seen his old friend Ruby forten years when he showed up in Dallas in mid-November 1963 for an extendedvisit. Ruby called Gruber in Los Angeles three hours after the assassination.Russell D. Matthews: An underworld character with a lengthy arrest record,Matthews has been linked to Campisi and Florida mob chief Santos Trafficante. Healso was described as a father figure by convicted hit man Charles V. Harrelson.Several people told the Warren Commission that Ruby and Matthews were friendsand on October 3, 1963, a call was placed from Ruby’s Carousel Club toMatthews’s former wife in Louisiana.Lenny Patrick: According to his sister, Ruby also placed calls to Patrick inlate 1963. Identified in a 1965 US Senate report as a high-ranking associate ofthe Chicago Mafia, Patrick reportedly was close to Chicago mob chieftain SamGiancana.Nofio J. Pecora: Described by various crime investigations as an ex-convict withseveral arrests, Pecora has been identified as one of Carlos Marcello’s mosttrusted aides. As late as October 30, 1963, a call was logged between the Dallasphone of Ruby and a New Orleans phone listed to Pecora.Johnny Roselli: A former associate of Al Capone, Roselli was one of the Mafiachiefs involved in the CIA-Mafia assassination plots against Castro and the manCIA pilot Tosh Plumlee claimed to have flown into Dallas the morning of theassassination. His mutilated body was found in an oil drum in Florida’s BiscayneBay in 1976 just before Roselli was scheduled to testify before the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations. According to columnist Jack Anderson, Roselli knewRuby and described him as “one of our boys.” According to reports from federalsources in Florida, Roselli and Ruby twice met secretly in Miami motel roomsduring the two months preceding the assassination. These meetings were monitoredby the FBI, which was keeping Roselli under surveillance. However, no mention ofthese meetings was made to the Warren Commission.Irwin S. Wiener: A close associate of Hoffa as well as other Teamster officials,Wiener has been connected to mob bosses Trafficante and Giancana. On October 26,1963, Wiener received a twelve-minute person-to-person call from Ruby’s CarouselClub. He later gave contradictory accounts of the content of this call.Lewis McWillie: A notorious Dallas gambler, McWillie worked for several gamblinghouses there during the 1940s, including Benny Benion’s Top of the Hill Club andW. C. Kirkwood’s Four Deuces Club in nearby Fort Worth. McWillie then joinedsuch famed gangsters as Santos Trafficante, Meyer and Jake Lansky, and DinoCellini in gambling operations in Havana, Cuba, before being thrown out byCastro. One of Ruby’s closest friends, McWillie received guns from Ruby whilestill in Cuba and, in fact, received a .38 Smith & Wesson from him as late asMay 10, 1963. Ruby told the Warren Commission, “I called him frequently. . . . Iidolized McWillie.” The Kirkwoods, who conducted high-stakes poker gamesinvolving wealthy Texans such as H. L. Hunt, Clint Murchinson, and Amon CarterSr., also played host to Texas politicians Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson, and JohnConnally. Kirkwood’s son, Pat, served alcoholic drinks to President Kennedy’sSecret Service guards well into the morning hours of November 22, 1963. Kirkwoodtold the House Select Committee on Assassinations that “Chilly” McWillie was aclose family friend. Warren Commission staffers saw several conspiratorial leadsin McWillie and recommended that he be called to testify about Ruby’s Cuban andmob connections, a recommendation that the Commission ignored.Despite these revealing associations, the Warren Commission Report stated, “TheCommission believes that the evidence does not establish a significant linkbetween Ruby and organized crime.”But Jack Ruby’s connection to crime was not limited to his friends andassociates. The record shows his involvement in a number of criminal activitiesincluding gambling, narcotics, prostitution, and gunrunning.In an interview with FBI agents on December 6, 1963, a small-time bookie namedWilliam Abadie described how he had worked briefly for Ruby writing gambling“tickets” as well as serving as a “slot machine and jukebox mechanic.” Accordingto this FBI report, only partially reported by the Warren Commission in Document86—the first page containing the FBI’s information about Ruby’s gamblingactivities was inexplicably missing from the Commission document—Abadie stated,“It was obvious [to me] that to operate gambling in the manner that he [Ruby]did, that he must have racketeering connections with other individuals in theCity of Dallas, as well as Fort Worth, Texas. . . . [This] applied also topolice connections with the two cities.”In fact, Abadie told agents that he had observed policemen coming and goingwhile acting as a bookie in a Ruby establishment.There is simply no question of Ruby’s connections to gambling and to gamblers,both local and national. Not so clear is Ruby’s connection to drugs.In one case, a drug offender named James Breen traveled to Dallas, where he madecontact with “a large narcotics setup operating between Mexico, Texas, and theEast,” according to Eileen Curry, Breen’s female companion. Curry told the FBIthat Breen’s contact with this drug ring was Jack Ruby. After Ruby killedOswald, the FBI again contacted Curry. She repeated her earlier contention thatRuby and Breen had been mixed up in a narcotics smuggling ring.There is also an abundance of evidence that Ruby was involved in other criminalactivities, such as prostitution, pornography, and bribery.The fact that Ruby was a pivotal contact man for criminal activity in Dallasseems affirmed by his lack of prosecution by Dallas authorities.Ruby’s Dallas rap sheet showed he was arrested nine times in sixteen years—oncharges ranging from operating his club after legal hours to using a gun to slugan off-duty Dallas policeman in a fight outside the Carousel Club—yet thetoughest conviction shown in his criminal record was a $35 fine for ignoring atraffic summons.[images/line.jpg]Jack Ruby’s criminal activity reached a peak in 1959, when he became even moreclosely connected to the mob and the Feds through their common interest in Cuba.Jack Ruby—Gunrunner and FBI Informant [Contents.html#rsec75]The year 1959 was a busy time for Jack Ruby. He made at least two trips to Cuba,making contact with gunrunners who had been arming Castro but were beginning toturn against the bearded leader, and he began serving as an informant for theFBI.Just prior to Castro’s takeover, American mobsters had helped supply therevolutionary with arms for his fight with Batista. While the dictator Batistawas friends with the mob, the gangsters were playing both sides of the fence,believing that if they helped Castro, they would be allowed to remain in Cubashould he succeed in his revolution.The smuggling of arms to Castro was overseen by Norman “Rough-house” Rothman, aburly associate of Miami mob boss Santos Trafficante Jr., who managedTrafficante’s Sans Souci casino in Havana. At the same time, Rothman reportedlywas splitting Havana slot machine revenues with Batista’s brother-in-law.After the assassination, the sister of a Cuban gunrunner gave informationindicating that Ruby was part of the Rothman operation. Mary Thompson said sheand her daughter traveled to the Florida Keys during June 1958, where herbrother introduced them to a man named “Jack.” The women were told that Jackowned a nightclub in Dallas and was a member of “the syndicate” who was runningsome guns to Cuba.This story later was corroborated by bureau informant Blaney Mack Johnson, whostated that in the early 1950s, Ruby had an interest in a notorious nightcluband gambling house in Hallandale, Florida, along with Meyer and Jake Lansky andother prominent mobsters. Johnson said Ruby was active in arranging illegalflights of weapons to Castro forces and named Edward Browder as one of thepilots operating for Ruby.Browder, a flamboyant Miami arms dealer, was a central figure in Rothman’sgunrunning operation, according to federal court documents. Another soldier offortune operating with Browder during this time was Frank Sturgis, who wouldmuch later be caught burglarizing the Watergate building along with menconnected to the Nixon White House.Although the FBI file on Browder reportedly contains more than 1,000 pages, thebureau gave only three small, innocuous reports to the Warren Commission.According to Wally Weston, the Carousel Club’s emcee who visited his formeremployer in the Dallas County Jail, Ruby said, “Wally, you know what’s going tohappen now? They’re going to find out about my trips to Cuba and my trips to NewOrleans and the guns and everything.”In mid-1959, the Rothman gunrunning operation was rocked when its chief wasarrested in connection with an $8.5 million Canadian bank burglary. Federalauthorities linked the bank job with a large theft of arms from an Ohio NationalGuard armory through a $6,000 airplane rental agreement by Rothman. Authoritiesagreed it appeared to all be part of a massive gunrunning operation to Cuba.And it was during this time that Ruby’s travels to Cuba increased significantly,thanks to Ruby’s mob idol, Lewis J. McWillie.McWillie—potentially a key central character in this swirl of gunrunners, drugsmugglers, mob hit men, CIA-Mafia assassination plots, and Texas gamblers—hasreceived scant attention from the two major government assassinationinvestigations.In his Warren Commission testimony, Ruby made no secret of his closeness toMcWillie, stating, “I called him frequently. . . . I idolized McWillie.”Despite Ruby’s accolades, Commission members declined to follow through on astaff recommendation to call McWillie to testify about his relationship withRuby and Mafia figures. The Warren Report made no mention of McWillie’s mob tiesor of McWillie’s FBI record, No. 4404064, which gives a list of aliases andcharacterizes him as a gangland killer.While the Warren Commission took Ruby’s and McWillie’s word that the 1959 tripsto Cuba were “purely social,” the House Select Committee on Assassinations didnot. After listing a number of visits to Cuba based on visas, airline tickets,and even a postcard, chief counsel Blakey wrote:We established beyond reasonable doubt that Ruby lied repeatedly and willfullyto the FBI and the Warren Commission about the number of trips he made to Cubaand their duration. . . . It was clear, for example, that the trips were notsocial jaunts; their purpose, we were persuaded, was to courier something,probably money, into or out of Cuba. . . . The evidence indicated strongly thatan association (with Trafficante) existed and that Ruby’s trip was related toTrafficante’s detention and release. We came to believe that Ruby’s trips toCuba were, in fact, organized-crime activities.Lewis J. McWillie was born May 4, 1908, in Kansas City, Missouri. From 1940until 1958 he lived in Dallas, where he managed several gambling operations,including the Four Deuces Club in nearby Fort Worth owned by gentleman gamblerW. C. Kirkwood. Recall it was his son, Pat Kirkwood, who hosted Kennedy’s SecretService agents the night before the assassination.In the summer of 1958, McWillie relocated to Havana, Cuba, where he worked forNorman Rothman as a pit boss in Trafficante’s Sans Souci casino. It was duringthis time that Ruby was encountered in the Florida Keys involved in gunrunningschemes run by Rothman.By September 1958, McWillie was manager of the Tropicana Hotel’s luxuriouscasino, then styled as “the largest nightclub in the world.” It was here thatMcWillie became a close associate of some of the mob’s most powerful leaders.Yet over the years, McWillie maintained that he knew these men only “casually,”but did admit an acquaintanceship with Dallas crime figures R. D. Matthews andJoseph Civello.It is interesting to note that both McWillie and Matthews were connected toDallas gambling operations during the 1950s; both went to work gambling inHavana, Cuba, in 1958–1959; and in later years, both were employed at BennyBinion’s Horseshoe Club in Las Vegas.When Castro closed the Tropicana, McWillie became pit boss at the Capri Hotel’scasino, another Trafficante property. The Capri was then run by Charlie “TheBlade” Tourine, whose mistress later confirmed that she was assisting FrankSturgis in an attempt to poison Castro.McWillie finally left Cuba in January 1961. According to Ruby and others, he wasone of the last American mobsters to leave the island.It should be pointed out that during the first half of 1961 McWillie was inMiami, the site of the CIA-Mafia assassination meetings involving Trafficante,Giancana, and Roselli. After that time, McWillie worked at a number of Nevadagambling casinos.In early 1959, McWillie’s boss Trafficante was arrested and jailed in theTrescornia Camp outside Havana. Within days of this incident, Jack Rubycontacted convicted Texas gunrunner Robert Ray McKeown, who in 1958 had receiveda two-year suspended sentence and five years on probation when convicted by USauthorities of conspiring to smuggle arms to Castro. His gunrunning activitiesbrought McKeown into close contact with two notable Cubans—one of whom was FidelCastro. McKeown was photographed with the bearded leader during a visit toHouston in April 1959. He was also close to Carlos Prio Socarras, formerpresident of Cuba, who quickly turned against Castro and became a leader of theanti-Castro Cubans in the United States.It was due to this closeness to Cuban leaders that McKeown was contacted bytelephone by a man who identified himself as “Jack Rubenstein of Dallas.” Thecaller said he had obtained McKeown’s phone number through a member of theHouston County Sheriff’s Office and had thought his name was “Davis.”“Davis” was the same name that Ruby mentioned to his attorneys when asked if heknew of anyone who could damage their legal plea of momentary insanity for Ruby.Indeed, a gunrunner named Tommy E. Davis not only was active in Texas at thattime but during Ruby’s trial showed up in Dallas and told Ruby’s attorneys thathe and Ruby had met several times to discuss the possibility of running arms toCuba. However, Davis denied that anything came of this planning. Tommy Davis waslinked to both US intelligence and crime circles.McKeown told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that Ruby told him herepresented Las Vegas interests that were seeking the release of three prisonersin Cuba. Ruby offered $5,000 each for help in obtaining release of theprisoners. McKeown told the caller he would accept the offer if money wereforthcoming. The caller said he would think about it.About three weeks later, McKeown said he was visited by Ruby at his businessnear Houston. Ruby said he had access to a large number of jeeps in Shreveport,Louisiana, which he was going to sell in Cuba. He offered McKeown $25,000 for aletter of introduction to Castro. Again, McKeown asked for money up front. Helater claimed that Ruby “never returned nor did he ever see him again.”Of equal interest is McKeown’s claim in later years that just weeks before theassassination, he was contacted by yet another man who wanted to buy weapons,particularly high-powered rifles with scopes. McKeown said this man identifiedhimself as “Lee Oswald.”In this story, which has been corroborated by a McKeown friend, Sam Neill, “LeeOswald” and a man named Hernandez showed up at McKeown’s home in late Septemberor early October 1963, saying they were involved in planning a revolution in ElSalvador. McKeown said he refused to sell arms to “Oswald.”Both McKeown and his friend Neill independently recognized Oswald on November22, 1963, as the man who had visited a few weeks earlier. However, both mendecided to keep quiet about the Oswald visit, saying later they were “scared” totell the FBI in 1964 what they knew. Indeed, a January 28, 1964, FBI documentpertaining to McKeown’s interview states, “To his knowledge, he has never seenor met Lee Harvey Oswald.”Although the House committee pointed to inconsistencies in McKeown’s variousaccounts of his contact with both Ruby and Oswald, on the whole—especially withthe Neill corroboration—his story has gained credence with many researchers.Yet another incident occurred in 1961 that indicates that Ruby’s gunrunningactivities may not have ceased in 1959. Nancy Perrin Rich worked for Ruby andbecame involved in Cuban gunrunning activities while married to Robert Perrin inDallas. In interviews with both the FBI and Warren Commission, she related howher mob-connected husband met with a group of anti-Castro Cubans in a Dallasapartment, presided over by a US Army lieutenant colonel. During this meeting,her husband was offered $10,000 to bring a boatload of Cuban refugees to Miami.The couple demanded a cash retainer.A few nights later, the Perrins met again with the Cubans, who promised moneywas on the way. Rich told the Warren Commission, “I had the shock of my life. .. . A knock comes on the door and who walks in but my little friend Jack Ruby .. . and everybody looks like . . . here comes the Savior.” She detected a bulgein Ruby’s jacket that disappeared quickly, leading her to conclude Ruby was the“bag man” bringing funds to the Cubans.Less than a year after this Ruby-Cuban meeting, Robert Perrin was found dead ofarsenic poisoning. His death was ruled a suicide.On November 26, 1963, long before any in-depth investigation was done on Ruby’sbackground, British journalist John Wilson informed the American embassy inLondon that he had been held in the Trescornia Camp outside Havana withTrafficante in the summer of 1959. Wilson said there he met an American gangstercalled Santos and that “Santos was visited several times by an American gangstertype named Ruby.” Wilson claimed the man named Ruby would come to the prisonwith people bringing food to Trafficante.Although Wilson is now dead, there is considerable corroboration to his story.Gerry Patrick Hemming, a CIA agent who in 1959 was serving with Castro’s forces,saw Ruby in a meeting with Castro leader Captain William Morgan during this timeand the talk centered around efforts to release Trafficante from prison. Sourceswithin the Dallas underworld claimed Ruby was the middleman who, acting onMcWillie’s orders, bought Trafficante’s freedom from Cuba with the sale ofblack-market jeeps to Castro.While this has not yet been officially confirmed, it is certainly significantthat there appears to have been much closer contact between Jack Ruby, Oswald’sslayer, and Santos Trafficante, the mob boss who predicted that Kennedy would be“hit.” The fact that Ruby idolized the stylish, gray-haired McWillie and woulddo “anything” for his mentor is especially intriguing in light of the closeassociation between McWillie and Trafficante.And during those active days in 1959, Ruby made another astonishing contact—theFederal Bureau of Investigation. The Warren Commission was quietly notified inearly 1964 that the bureau had contacted Jack Ruby in 1959 as an informant butasked that the Commission keep this explosive fact a secret. The contents ofthis February 27, 1964, memo from Director Hoover to Warren Commission generalcounsel J. Lee Rankin was not made public until 1975. The memo, belatedlydiscovered through “a search of all files in the Dallas [FBI] office whereinreferences to Jack Ruby appeared,” stated:For your information, Ruby was contacted by an Agent of the Dallas Office onMarch 11, 1959, in view of his position as a nightclub operator who might haveknowledge of the criminal element in Dallas. He was advised of the Bureau’sjurisdiction in criminal matters, and he expressed a willingness to furnishinformation along these lines. He was subsequently contacted on eight occasionsbetween March 11, 1959, and October 2, 1959, but he furnished no informationwhatever and further contacts with him were discontinued. Ruby was never paidany money, and he was never at any time an informant of this Bureau.The Commission not only failed to see the significance of the nine meetingsbetween the FBI and Ruby during the very time he was trying to free mob bossTrafficante, but also did not bother to question the FBI agent who had met withRuby.But many law-enforcement officers, both state and federal, have privately statedthat both the frequency and duration of these Ruby contacts suggests there wasmore to the relationship than Hoover would admit.The House Select Committee on Assassinations did interview Charles W. Flynn, theFBI agent who met with Ruby. According to Flynn, Ruby initiated the contacts onMarch 11, 1959, rather than the bureau as stated in the Hoover memo. Flynn saidRuby told him he wanted to give information on a confidential basis and so Flynnopened a potential criminal informant (PCI) file on Ruby. Flynn said he closedthe file on November 6, 1959, because Ruby had not been particularly helpful.The House committee staff was intrigued by this connection between Ruby and theFBI at the time Ruby was making trips to Cuba. The committee’s chief counsellater wrote:Ruby could, of course, have contacted the FBI with no ulterior motive, and itcould have been wholly unrelated to his Cuban activities. . . . We [thecommittee staff] believed, however, that Ruby’s behavior was consistent with thepattern of seasoned offenders, who often cultivate a relationship with a lawenforcement agency during a period when they are engaging in a criminal activityin the hope that, if they are caught, they can use the relationship to secureimmunity from prosecution.On April 27, 1959, shortly after his first contact with Agent Flynn and the daybefore their next scheduled meeting, Ruby rented safety deposit box 448 atMerchants State Bank in Dallas, where he maintained a small business checkingaccount.Sometime before he rented the bank box, Ruby bought more than $500 worth oftape-recording equipment. The saleswoman, contacted by Secret Service agentsshortly after the assassination, recalled that Ruby bought “a wristwatch whichheld a microphone for the equipment, and also an instrument to bug a telephone .. . [and a] tie clip and attaché case.” An FBI agent also interviewed thesaleswoman but filed a meager two-paragraph report, omitting the descriptions ofthe electronic bugging equipment.From the time Ruby acquired the safety deposit box through the fall of 1959,researchers have discerned a pattern—both before and after making a trip toCuba, Ruby would enter this deposit box and then contact the FBI.Flynn denied to the House committee that he and Ruby had discussed the Cubanvisits, but in later years Flynn reportedly admitted to news reporters that Rubymay have mentioned one trip to Cuba.And apparently Ruby was making no secret of his Cuban sojourns at the time. Hesent a postcard from Havana to a girlfriend in Dallas and he was overheardtelling one of his employees not to say where he was going “unless it was to thepolice or some other official agency.”It also should be noted that three days after Ruby shot Oswald, authorities inNew Orleans received a tip that Jack Ruby had bought some paintings while inthat city in the summer of 1959. While this information seemed hardly germane tothe assassination, its source points to the involvement of US intelligence, forthis bit of art news came from William George Gaudet, the CIA operative whoaccompanied Oswald to Mexico.So apparently the CIA was tracking Ruby’s movements in 1959, and after theassassination, Ruby was fearful that his activities in New Orleans—whichobviously involved Cuba—would be found out.The House Select Committee on Assassinations determined that Ruby may have madeas many as six trips to Cuba, but most significantly, this issue was clouded andpassed off by both the FBI and the Warren Commission.When Warren Commission attorneys Leon Hubert and Burt Griffin—both assigned tothe Ruby aspect of the investigation—requested further probing of Ruby’s Cubanconnections, they were rebuffed by both the CIA and other Commission staffmembers. In later years, Warren Commission staffer Howard P. Willens, theliaison with the Department of Justice, explained the commission’s reluctance toprobe deeper by telling newsman Seth Kantor, “These Cuban pursuits representedsome kind of bottomless pit and our overall investigation had to be wrapped up.”Considered all together, the activities of Jack Ruby involving Cuba,Trafficante, McWillie, and the FBI represent a whole new dimension of theassassination—one that has yet to be fully explored.But these connections, especially in light of the theory on mob involvement inthe assassination, certainly elevate Ruby far above the simple, emotionalnightclub owner pictured by the Warren Commission.As the day of Kennedy’s assassination approached, Jack Ruby remained in contactwith a variety of mob figures both by telephone and in person.One of the most intriguing incidents involved Johnny Roselli, the gangsterinvolved with Santos Trafficante and Sam Giancana in the CIA-Mafia assassinationplots and the man said to have been flown into Dallas on the morning of November22, 1963, by “black ops” pilot Tosh Plumlee.It has become known that beginning in the summer of 1963 and continuing intoNovember, the FBI had Roselli under surveillance.Researchers were surprised in later years that the bureau had monitored twoseparate meetings between Roselli and Jack Ruby that occurred within two monthsof Kennedy’s death. Roselli, who later began to speak openly to columnist JackAnderson, admitted to knowing Ruby, calling him “one of our boys.” What thesemeetings were about and why they were not reported to the Warren Commission isnot known, but to most researchers this is yet another clear example of theFBI’s suppression of evidence.The Woman Who Foresaw the Assassination [Contents.html#rsec76]One of the most intriguing stories to come out of the assassination caseinvolved a woman who claimed to have worked for Ruby and who is on record withforeknowledge of Kennedy’s death.On November 20, 1963, two days before the assassination, Louisiana State Policelieutenant Francis Fruge journeyed to Eunice, Louisiana, to pick up a woman whohad received minor abrasions when she was thrown from a moving car. This scenewas depicted at the beginning of the Oliver Stone film but with noidentification of the woman or any explanation of its meaning.The woman appeared to be under the influence of some drug. She later was drivento the state hospital in Jackson, Louisiana. On the way she told Fruge that shehad been traveling with two men “who were Italians or resembled Italians” fromFlorida to Dallas. When Fruge asked her what she planned to do in Dallas, thewoman replied, “Number one, pick up some money, pick up [my] baby and . . . killKennedy.”Thus began the strange saga of Melba Christine Marcades, better known as RoseCheramie.While at the state hospital, Cheramie told doctors there that Kennedy was to bekilled in Dallas. She appeared quite lucid and hospital records studied by theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations reflect the woman was diagnosed as“without psychosis. However, because of her previous record of drug addictionshe may have a mild integrative and pleasure defect.”Dr. Victor Weiss told committee investigators that Cheramie said she had workedfor Jack Ruby and that her knowledge of the assassination came from “word in theunderworld.”The day of the assassination, Lieutenant Fruge immediately remembered the womanand her apparent foreknowledge. He returned to the state hospital and tookCheramie into custody. During questioning she said the two men were on their wayfrom Florida to Dallas to kill Kennedy. She said she was to receive $8,000 forher part in this activity and was then to accompany the two men to Houston tocomplete a drug deal and pick up her young son. She even gave Fruge the name ofboth a seaman and a ship that were involved in the drug deal and Fruge verifiedthis information through US Customs.Fruge also confirmed the woman’s story by talking to a Louisiana lounge owner.The owner related how two men and a woman had stopped at his lounge aboutNovember 20 and that the owner knew the men to be two pimps who regularlytransported prostitutes from Florida. He said the woman became intoxicated andwas taken outside after one of her companions “slapped her around.”Fruge said he soon contacted Dallas police captain Will Fritz, the man in chargeof the assassination investigation, believing that he had uncovered valuableinformation. However, after Fritz told him he “wasn’t interested,” Fruge droppedhis investigation.Interestingly, the House committee found that although the FBI had no record ofCheramie’s prediction of the assassination, it did have reports that a MelbaMarcades (Cheramie) had tipped bureau agents that she was traveling to Dallas todeliver heroin to a man in Oak Cliff, then to Galveston to pick up a shipment ofdrugs. The bureau had looked into the matter but, unsurprisingly, decided thatthe woman’s information was “erroneous in all respects.”On September 4, 1965, one month after yet another attempt to contact the FBIwith similar information, Marcades/Cheramie was found dead by a highway near BigSandy, Texas—a small town in east Texas about midway between Dallas andLouisiana. A man told authorities that Cheramie was lying in the roadway,apparently after being thrown from a car, and that he drove over her head whiletrying to avoid her. Police could find no relationship between the woman and thedriver and the case was closed. However, Fruge later told researchers that whenhe attempted to contact the driver, he found the man’s Tyler, Texas, address tobe nonexistent.While the entire Rose Cheramie episode was extensively covered in a staff reportto the House Select Committee on Assassinations and essentially verified, oddlythere was no mention of her in the committee’s report.Did Ruby and Oswald Know Each Other? [Contents.html#rsec77]Both federal investigations of the assassination announced publicly that theycould not establish any link between Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald.The Warren Commission flatly stated, “There is no evidence that Oswald and Rubyknew each other or had any relationship through a third party or parties.”Yet according to the Commission’s own internal memos, staffers were not all thatcertain. Arguing that further investigation was needed, Commission lawyers BurtGriffin and Leon Hubert wrote, “In short, we believe that the possibilityexists, based on evidence already available, that Ruby was involved in illegaldealings with Cuban elements who might have had contact with Oswald.”In its report, the House Select Committee on Assassinations also seems toquestion the Warren Commission’s conclusion by pointing out:The Commission also found no evidence that Ruby and Oswald had ever beenacquainted, although the Commission acknowledged that they both lived in the OakCliff section of Dallas, [both] had post office boxes at the Terminal Annex, andhad possible but tenuous third party links. These included Oswald’s landlady,Earlene Roberts, whose sister, Bertha Cheek, had visited Ruby at his nightclubon November 18, and a fellow boarder at Oswald’s rooming house, John Carter, whowas friendly with a close friend and employee of Ruby, Wanda Killam.While leaving the impression that no link existed between Ruby and Oswald, theHouse committee in fact left the possibility open by concluding, “TheCommittee’s investigation of Oswald and Ruby showed a variety of relationshipsthat may have matured into an assassination conspiracy. Neither Oswald nor Rubyturned out to be ‘loners,’ as they had been painted in the 1964 investigation.”And the body of evidence connecting Ruby and Oswald continues to grow.As far back as 1964, General Edwin A. Walker—himself a figure in theassassination case—told this author, “The Warren Commission Report wasridiculous and a sham as well as an insult to the public’s intelligence.Rubenstein knew Oswald; Oswald knew Rubenstein. The report would have to startall over on this basic fact.”Recall that Julia Ann Mercer identified both Ruby and Oswald as the men she sawnear the Triple Underpass with a rifle shortly before the assassination and thatOswald’s mother, Marguerite, claimed an FBI agent showed her a photograph ofJack Ruby the night before Oswald was shot.Stories have circulated around Dallas since 1963 about Ruby and Oswald beingseen together. On November 26, 1963, the Dallas Morning News quoted assistantdistrict attorney Bill Alexander as saying, “[Investigators] have received atleast a hundred tips [linking Oswald to Jack Ruby] and are checking out eachone. As far as I know, none has panned out.” This merely meant none wereaccepted.As early as Monday, November 25, 1963, news reporters were receiving informationof a Ruby-Oswald link. Some were not easy to dismiss, especially the number fromRuby’s Carousel Club.Madeleine Brown worked for one of Dallas’s leading advertising firms in 1963.She handled some of the agency’s biggest accounts. After work, she and coworkerswould unwind at various watering holes, including the Carousel Club. Brownrecalled that in the spring of 1963 as she and her friends sat in the CarouselClub the conversation turned to speculation over who might have taken a shot atGeneral Edwin A. Walker. The group was surprised to hear Jack Ruby blurt outthat the man who shot at Walker was Lee Oswald.Brown took note of the name because she had never heard it before and becauseRuby seemed so confident of the name of Walker’s assailant. She was shocked thefollowing November to see the names Ruby and Oswald tied to the assassination.She told this author, “I asked around and found out that many people knew thatOswald and Ruby knew each other. In fact, I just assumed that everyone knewthis. I was surprised when, well into the 1980s, I learned that officially theywere not supposed to be connected.”Another fascinating story was offered by former Dallas cabdriver RaymondCummings. During the Garrison investigation, Cummings saw a news story with aphotograph of David Ferrie, who claimed that he had never been in Dallas.Cummings contacted Garrison’s office to say he had driven David Ferrie and LeeHarvey Oswald to Ruby’s Carousel Club in the early part of 1963.Even more convincing are the accounts of Ruby and Oswald seen together byemployees of the Carousel Club. William D. Crowe Jr., a magician and entertainerwho was using the stage name Bill DeMar and performing in Ruby’s Carousel Clubat the time of the assassination, called a news media friend right afterOswald’s arrest. He said Oswald had participated in his act about a week priorto the assassination.On November 25, Crowe told the Associated Press he was “positive” Oswald hadpatronized Ruby’s club: “I have a memory act in which I have 20 customers callout various objects in rapid order. Then I tell them at random what they calledout. I am positive Oswald was one of the men that called out an object aboutnine days ago.”Crowe later told the Dallas Morning News that after the Associated Press storyappeared, he was contacted by FBI agents who told him to check out of his Dallashotel and go into hiding.The Warren Commission Report went to great lengths to downplay Crowe’s story,including quoting Crowe as saying, “I never stated definitely, positively [thatI saw Oswald], and they said I did, and all in all, what they had in the paperwas hardly even close to what I told them.” Crowe was not asked if he had beenintimidated or why he told the same story of seeing Oswald to Dallas MorningNews reporter Kent Biffle several days later.The Warren Commission likewise brushed off the testimony of Dallas electronicssalesman Robert K. Patterson, who said that Jack Ruby along with a man wholooked like Oswald bought some equipment from him on November 1, 1963.Commissioners said Ruby’s companion most likely was a Carousel Club employeenamed Larry Crafard who “bears a strong resemblance to Oswald.”The Commission noted that at least four other persons had told them of seeingOswald in the Carousel Club, but these stories also were dismissed. No mentionwas made of Rose Cheramie or Beverly Oliver, the Dealey Plaza assassinationwitness who told researchers Ruby introduced her to “Lee Oswald of the CIA” afew weeks before the assassination.Oliver, now a Christian evangelist using another name, told British television:I purposely waited this long [to publicly tell the story] because I feltthreatened. . . . I didn’t want to become another statistic. About two weeksprior to the assassination, between shows [she was a singer at the nearby ColonyClub and would frequently visit Ruby’s Carousel Club], I trotted over. There wasthis girl who danced there by the name of Jada. And she was sitting at a tablewith Jack Ruby and another man. I went and sat down with them to have a drink.As I sat down, Ruby introduced me to this man. He said, “Beverly, this is myfriend Lee.” And after Jack Ruby went into the police station and killed LeeHarvey Oswald, it was then I realized it was the man I had met in the club twoweeks before the assassination. . . . Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald werelinked together but I don’t know how. . . . But I know in my heart that LeeHarvey Oswald, or the man shot in the police station, was the man I met in theclub two weeks before the assassination.She told this author of meeting David Ferrie in the Carousel Club. She saidFerrie was there so often that she initially took him to be assistant manager ofthe club. Her story was supported by other Carousel employees who also recalledseeing Ruby and Oswald together.Karen Bennett Carlin, who danced in Ruby’s club using the name “Little Lynn,”was the woman to whom Ruby mailed a $25 money order minutes before shootingOswald. Interviewed by the FBI on November 24, 1963, Carlin “seemed on the vergeof hysteria.” FBI agent Roger C. Warner reported:Mrs. Carlin was highly agitated and was reluctant to make any statement to me.She stated to me that she was under the impression that Lee Oswald, Jack Ruby,and other individuals unknown to her, were involved in a plot to assassinatePresident Kennedy and that she would be killed if she gave any information tothe authorities.Janet Adams Conforto, known as “Jada,” told Dallas news reporters shortly afterthe assassination that she had seen Oswald in the Carousel Club. Likewise, BillWillis, a musician at the club, reportedly recalled Oswald sitting “right in thecorner of the [club’s] stage and runway.”Ruby stripper Kathy Kay told the Dallas Times Herald in 1975 that she recalledseeing Oswald in the club and even danced with him on one occasion.This account is supported by Bobbie Louise Meserole, who danced at the CarouselClub under the name Shari Angel. Meserole, who went on to become an ordainedminister in Dallas, remembered Jack Ruby fondly. She told this author sherecalled conversations with Kathy Kay and others in which they laughingly toldhow Ruby had ordered Kay to dance a bump and grind to embarrass Oswald.Shari Angel’s husband, Walter “Wally” Weston, who was the Carousel Club’s masterof ceremonies until five days before the assassination, told of striking Oswald.In a 1976 interview with the New York Daily News, Weston said he had seen Oswaldwith Ruby in the Carousel Club at least twice prior to the assassination. Westonrecalled:I was working in the club one night approximately three weeks before theassassination. I was on stage, doing my bit, and this guy was standing near theback wall. The club was pretty crowded. The guy walked up in the middle of theclub, right in front of the stage, and for no reason he said, “I think you’re acommunist.” I said, “Sir, I’m an American. Why don’t you sit down.” He said,“Well, I still think you’re a communist,” so I jumped off the stage and hit him.Jack was right behind him when I hit him. He landed in Jack’s arms and Jackgrabbed him and said, “You [son of a bitch], I told you never to come in here.”And he wrestled him to the door and threw him down the stairs.After the assassination, Weston said he recognized Oswald as the man in the clubbut did not say anything when questioned briefly by the FBI and a Dallasdetective because he was afraid after discussing the matter with other Carouselemployees. He said, “[Carousel drummer] Billy Willis saw me hit [Oswald]. When Idiscussed it with him [and dancer Kathy Kay], he said, ‘Wally, the best thing todo is to stay out of it. Just keep your mouth shut. Don’t say anything. That’swhat I’m going to do. I don’t want any part of this.’”Willis later told a former FBI agent that he changed both his name and SocialSecurity number after all the other members of the Carousel band were killed.Willis said he definitely recalled one incident shortly before the assassinationin which he returned a satchel to Oswald in the club’s parking lot after Oswaldhad left it in a circular booth.Weston visited Ruby in jail several times. He recalled, “The one time Imentioned it to him, I said, ‘Jack, wasn’t that the guy I hit in the club?’ Hejust looked at me and didn’t say yes or no.”Another reason Weston decided to talk in 1976 was that he claimed to have“bumped into” a gangster in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who had been at a meetingwith Ruby in the Carousel Club five days before the assassination. In apublished interview, Weston said, “[This guy] said to me, ‘I know you, you wereJack Ruby’s emcee.’ I asked him when he had been at the Carousel Club and hetold me he was at the table the night the gun went on the floor.”The shaken Weston vividly recalled that night:There was a meeting held at Jack Ruby’s club the night I left there, which wasfive days before the assassination of President Kennedy. There wereapproximately six to eight guys from Chicago who came into the club—friends ofJack Ruby. I first really noticed them at about 1:30 in the morning, rightbefore closing. Four of them were sitting at a front table, the rest hung aroundthe bar. I was on stage telling jokes and while I was up there, the ones at thetable were talking to each other. So I walked to the front of the stage wherethey were sitting and said, “Hey, you guys, cool it.” One of them looked at theothers and said, “Who is this son of a bitch?” and he pulled a gun out of hiswaistband. . . . It looked like a cannon pointed in my direction. At thisprecise time, two uniformed policemen came in the front door. They just happenedto walk in—which was not unusual at Jack’s club. I said to the four guys at thetable, “The police are here.” The gun went to the floor immediately and waskicked over to the side. Jack Ruby, in the meantime, was explaining to thepolicemen that everything was all right and that there was no problem. After theshow, Jack introduced me to the men. . . . He didn’t introduce them to me byname, he just said, “These are friends of mine from Chicago.”Weston might not have thought too much about this incident except that hereturned to the club after closing to retrieve his jacket. One of the men fromChicago opened the door but refused to allow him inside. When he asked the manto go get Jack Ruby the man also refused, saying, “You can’t come in now.”Understanding that something very secret was going on in the club, Weston left.In 1976, after encountering one of the Chicago toughs who had been at themeeting, Weston decided he should tell his story. Incredible as Weston’s storyseems, at least two people have corroborated it. A convicted murderer andmobster named Myron Thomas Billet, also known as Paul Buccilli, admitted in 1976that he attended just such a meeting in Ruby’s club. Billet stated:I was at the Whitemarsh Valley Country Club back in the late part of 1963 when Iwas contacted by the Mob for a meeting in Dallas at Jack Ruby’s Carousel Club.As I remember it, there was myself, Jack Ruby, Lee Oswald, Sam Giancana, JohnRoselli, and an FBI man. The meeting was to set up a “hit” on John F. Kennedy. Ican’t say what the arrangement was because Sam and I left. Sam told me he wantednothing to do with it. Hell, he helped put Kennedy in office. But three weekslater, JFK was hit and we all knew it wasn’t done by one man. Sam told me thenthat he figured this would get us all killed before it was over.One man never questioned by the government was C. B. Caldera, a resident ofNeely Street. In 1990, he told of seeing Oswald, whom he recognized as hisneighbor, inside Ruby’s Carousel Club.Then there is the experience of Ester Ann Mash, who came forward only in recentyears. Mash told this author she served drinks at a meeting in the Carousel Clubthat included “gangsters” from Chicago, Jack Ruby, and Lee Harvey Oswald.She had been a waitress at a restaurant near Love Field when a Dallas detectiveintroduced her to Ruby early in 1963. Shortly after their introduction, Rubyenticed her into working at the Carousel Club, but only as a waitress andchampagne hostess. She explained, “He wanted me to strip, but I just couldn’tbring myself to do that.” In addition to her club duties, Mash became a lover toRuby, who she said took her to gambling parties around Dallas.In the late spring of 1963, she said, Ruby asked her to serve drinks at agathering in a meeting area of the Carousel Club. Mash said the meeting wascomposed of Ruby, five “gangster types,” and a young man who only sipped beer.She described the meeting:I had to follow Jack’s orders to the letter for that meeting. He demandedabsolute privacy and no interruptions. I was the only person allowed to enterthe room and that was just to serve the drinks and then get out. Five mendressed in suits, looking very businesslike, came in about ten thirty thatnight. They were all dark, swarthy men who looked like gangsters out of somemovie. There was another man, dressed real casual—he didn’t look like he fit inwith the rest of the group at all. There were seven all together [includingRuby]. They talked until about one o’clock in the morning. Then the men in suitsleft. Jack went to his apartment behind the club. And the other guy stayed untilclosing watching the strippers. He couldn’t take his eyes off them. That man wasLee Harvey Oswald. I really remember him because he was so unusual from therest. He kept ordering beer. Everyone else drank mixed drinks but thiswimpy-looking little guy. I might not remember a name, but I always remember aface. It was a serious meeting and although I did not overhear what they weretalking about at the time, I am convinced that they were discussing killingKennedy. I knew it had something to do with the Mafia because everybody in townin those days knew Ruby had something to do with the mob. Also, Jack asked me totake care of these guys, so later I played up to them a little and discoveredthey were Mafia guys from Chicago.About two months after this meeting, Mash had a falling-out with Ruby. Sheexplained:He accused me of bringing the vice squad to the club but I didn’t. But hewouldn’t listen to me. He cussed me out. It upset me, so I left. Also, it wasreal strange, but I had a very bad feeling, a premonition, that I had better getaway from Dallas. So I moved to Euless and got a job in a restaurant, then latermoved to Phoenix. I was not even in Dallas the day of the assassination. I didnot pay much attention to the news after the assassination. But then on Sundaymorning, my children were watching TV when they were showing them moving Oswald.Ruby shot him and I screamed, “Oh, my god!” I couldn’t believe my eyes. Ithought, “That’s the weird little man who was at that secret meeting with Jackand those Mafia types.” I saw that grin on Oswald’s face on TV the day Jack shothim. He was smiling because Jack was his friend. I didn’t want to be involved,so I kept quiet. But now I have a blood clot on the right side of my brain as aresult of a car accident. I’ve already lived longer than I am supposed to.That’s the reason I’m telling you this now. Somebody needs to know this before Idie.But an even more damning story concerning Ruby and Oswald comes from CarrollJarnagin, a credible, if eccentric, attorney. Jarnagin explained to this authorthat he visited Ruby’s Carousel Club on October 4, 1963, to discuss a legal casewith one of Ruby’s strippers. While seated in a booth at the club, Jarnaginoverheard Jack Ruby—whom he knew well—talking with another man. Jarnagin heardthe man tell Ruby, “Don’t use my real name. I’m going by the name of O. H. Lee.”This, of course, was the name Lee Harvey Oswald used to rent a room on NorthBeckley in Oak Cliff.Jarnagin described this meeting:These men were talking about plans to kill the governor of Texas. Rubyexplained, “He [Governor Connally] won’t work with us on paroles. With a few ofthe right boys out we could really open up this state, with a little cooperationfrom the governor.” Then Ruby offered Lee a drug franchise. Ruby also said thatthe boys really wanted to kill Robert Kennedy. Lee offered to go to Washingtonto do the job. They then discussed using public lockers and pay telephones aspart of hiding their plot. Ruby assured Lee that he could shoot Connally from awindow in the Carousel Club and then escape out a back door. Lee was asking formoney. He wanted half of the money in advance, but Ruby told him he would getone lump sum after the job was done.One thing that sets Jarnagin’s story apart from the others is that he contactedauthorities with his information prior to the assassination. The day afterhearing Ruby’s conversation, Jarnagin telephoned the Texas Department of PublicSafety. Nothing came of this.Jarnagin stated, “[After Ruby shot Oswald] I definitely realized that thepicture in the November 23, 1963, Dallas Times Herald of Lee Harvey Oswald was apicture of the man using the name O. H. Lee, whose conversation with Jack Ruby Ihad overheard back on October 4, 1963.”After the assassination, Jarnagin again contacted the authorities, this time theDallas police and the FBI. He was interviewed but his startling account of aRuby-Oswald plot was buried deep in the volumes of the Warren Commission andnever mentioned in its report.In fact, the Warren Commission quickly dismissed rumors circulating throughoutDallas in 1963–1964 that Ruby and Oswald knew each other by stating, “Allassertions that Oswald was seen in the company of Ruby or anyone else at theCarousel Club have been investigated. None of them merits any credence.”Jarnagin said when he tried to tell the FBI what he knew, agents accused him ofhaving hallucinations. The attorney huffed, “It was clearly abuse of a witness.”His tale of an Oswald-Ruby plot finally garnered headlines, this time in 2008.It seems district attorney Henry Wade revamped Jarnagin’s account, turning itinto a script of Ruby and Oswald plotting, not against Governor Connally, butagainst President Kennedy. His script adaptation was found in an old safe in thedistrict attorney’s office.The media as well as Gary Mack, by then Sixth Floor Museum curator, laughed offthe find as simply an attempt at making a “bad B movie.” No mention was made ofthe fact that the Ruby-Oswald plot was a genuine report to authorities Jarnaginmade prior to the assassination.The disparate meeting times given in these reports—Mash said late spring 1963,Weston indicated about mid-October, and Jarnagin pinpointed October 4, 1963—andthe people involved indicate the possibility that more than one meetinginvolving Ruby and Oswald occurred.And neither the FBI nor the Warren Commission ever talked to Rose Cheramie,Beverly Oliver, Ester Mash, Wally Weston, Shari Angel, Billy Willis, C. B.Caldera, or Madeleine Brown.There is tantalizing evidence that authorities knew more than they were tellingabout a relationship between Oswald and Ruby. In 1976, four Dallas deputyconstables told the Dallas Morning News that shortly after the assassinationthey had examined a boxful of handwritten notes and other papers in the DallasCounty Courthouse that linked Ruby and Oswald together.Deputy Billy Preston said he and constable Robie Love, now deceased, handed thebox of documents over to Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade in late 1963or early 1964. Wade told the paper he didn’t recall receiving the papers.Preston, along with deputy constables Mike Callahan and Ben Cash, said the boxof papers came from the apartment of a Dallas woman. Preston explained, “She wasreally scared because she had all that stuff. She wanted me to pick it up forher. And I just wished I had made some more copies now.”Preston could not recall the woman’s name other than “Mary,” but then and now hebelieves she had some connection with Oswald because most of the box’s contentsappeared to have been written by him.Cash, however, recalled that the box came from the woman’s roommate, who hadkept it for a Latin American boyfriend. Cash told reporter Earl Golz, “Theimpression I got [was that] the papers were from the Latin American because hementioned Ruby and he mentioned Oswald in the writings. He didn’t mention thethird party but he kept referring to a third party. And the third party wouldhave to be him.”Among the papers in the box, according to the deputies, were newspaper clippingsfrom Mexico, a photocopy of a press card with the words “Daily Worker” issued toRuby, a receipt from a motel near New Orleans dated several weeks before theassassination with both the names Ruby and Oswald on it and references to callsto Mexico City, papers pinpointing a landing strip somewhere in Mexico, andreferences to meetings with “agents” in the border towns of McAllen and Laredo,Texas. There was also a church brochure with markings indicating something aboutgoing to Cuba.Preston said one handwritten note referred to a plan to assassinate PresidentKennedy during the dedication of a lake or dam in Wisconsin. Lawmen in Wisconsinhad speculated in December 1963 about the existence of just such a plan afterdiscovering what appeared to be Lee Harvey Oswald’s signature on the registry ofa restaurant in Hubertus, Wisconsin, dated September 16, 1963. Kennedy indeedhad made a speech on September 24, 1963, in Ashland, Wisconsin, as part of anationwide conservation tour. The FBI rejected the signature as Oswald’s andthis subject received little attention outside Wisconsin.Deputy Cash explained why the men had not made this story public earlier:At that time it was a pretty hot issue, you remember. So we kept quiet and wentalong with the game. We figured it would be handled on a higher level [than us].And when it didn’t come out, we thought at that time possibly they [the WarrenCommission] thought that kind of information tying it into the Cubans orRussians couldn’t be released at that time because it might put us in World WarIII.Wade finally admitted the incident with the box of documents “might well havehappened,” but added, “but I know that whatever they had didn’t amount tonothing.” Whether it did or not may never be known because as far as anyofficial investigation, the box simply never existed.It would appear that despite the protestations of the two federalinvestigations, the evidence of an Oswald-Ruby connection is overwhelming.Even former Dallas police chief Jesse Curry seems to indicate such arelationship existed in his 1969 book by noting, “Witnesses to the shooting [ofOswald] wondered if there wasn’t a gleam of recognition in Oswald’s eye whenRuby stepped out from the newsmen.”[images/line.jpg]Whether it may ever be conclusively proven that Ruby and Oswald were in contact,there is no doubt that Ruby was in touch with associates of mob and Teamsterleaders—and that telephone calls with them markedly increased in the daysleading up to the assassination.In March 1963, Ruby made fewer than ten long-distance calls and from May toSeptember this number averaged monthly between twenty-five and thirty-five. ButRuby’s toll calls climbed to more than seventy in October and almost one hundredin November.This surge in phone traffic also intrigued Warren Commission investigatorsHubert and Griffin, who asked the FBI to thoroughly examine all calls by Ruby,his family, and his associates. They also requested that the bureau have phonecompanies in Texas, Nevada, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit,Boston, New York, Washington, Miami, and New Orleans freeze all records untilCommission staff could study them.Apparently this was never done. Griffin later told the House Select Committee onAssassinations that while the bureau did compile some telephone information, itwas not the comprehensive check he had asked for and that “no request to freezerecords was made to telephone companies.” When the House committee got around torequesting these same records, most had been routinely destroyed.Nevertheless, enough information on Ruby’s calls has become available to paint aportrait of a man frantically touching bases across the nation as November 22,1963, approached. While some of Ruby’s calls could be dismissed as obviouslypersonal or business communications, some—such as frequent calls to HaroldTannenbaum, who ran several New Orleans nightclubs that were owned at least inpart by mob boss Carlos Marcello—may have served sinister purposes. Near the endof October, Ruby placed a call to Nofio Pecora, one of Marcello’s closestassociates. The House committee developed information that Pecora owned theTropical Court Tourist Park, a New Orleans trailer court in which Tannenbaumlived.Ruby made at least seven traceable calls to his “mentor,” gambler LewisMcWillie, beginning in June 1963. He also was in touch with Irwin S. Weiner, abondsman and insurance agent connected with Santos Trafficante, Sam Giancana,and several other crime-syndicate figures. He also placed a seventeen-minutecall in early November to Robert “Barney” Baker, identified as “Hoffa’sambassador of violence” by attorney general Robert Kennedy.When questioned by House investigators, all of these telephone contacts said theRuby calls were innocuous and pertained only to some union problems Ruby washaving with the American Guild of Variety Artists. The committee concluded, “Wewere no more satisfied with [this] explanation than we were with McWillie’s,Weiner’s, or Baker’s.”Union disagreements were not the only problem Ruby faced in the fall of 1963.His problems with the IRS alone were enough to motivate him to follow orders tokill Oswald.According to the Warren Commission:In 1960, the government filed tax liens for more than $20,000 [against Ruby]. InNovember 1962, the government rejected Ruby’s offer to pay $8,000 to compromisethe assessed taxes of more than $20,000 because he had not filed returns forother federal taxes and had not paid these taxes as they became due. These othertaxes . . . amounted to an additional $20,000.Testimony from Ruby’s friends and acquaintances confirmed that he wascomplaining of his tax debts to anyone who would listen and the House committeedetermined that Ruby’s tax liability may have been closer to $60,000 than the$40,000 the Warren Commission mentioned.One June 6, 1963, Ruby’s attorney, Graham R. E. Koch, informed the InternalRevenue Service that his client would settle his debts “as soon as arrangementscan be made to borrow money.” However, an FBI check of more than fifty bankinginstitutions revealed no attempt by Ruby to borrow money legitimately.Did Ruby turn to the mob for help? His flurry of phone calls would seem toindicate this as well as a quick trip to Las Vegas two weekends before theassassination.Recall that Marguerite Oswald claimed she was fired from her job after heremployer, Fort Worth publisher and high-stakes gambler Amon G. Carter Jr.,traveled to Las Vegas at the same time Ruby was there. Some have speculated thatCarter got word from Vegas sources that Marguerite should be dropped from thefamily’s employment before her son was named as a presidential assassin. TheWarren Commission rejected the idea that Ruby visited America’s gamblingcapital, but the House committee found “credible evidence” that Ruby was there.Both a cashier and the credit manager of the Stardust Hotel recalled that a mannamed Ruby, who claimed to own a club in Dallas, attempted to cash a check oneweekend in mid-November. The FBI confirmed this trip through “confidentialinformation.”Ruby’s lawyer later told newsman Seth Kantor that it was right after thisalleged trip that Ruby told him “he had a connection who would supply him withmoney to settle his long-standing government tax problems.”Taking the long view, House committee chief counsel Robert Blakey noted, “Ruby’sbusiness was in deep financial difficulty, complicated by the dispute with AGVA[the American Guild of Variety Artists] over ‘amateur’ strippers and serious taxproblems.”After pointing out Ruby’s union and tax problems as well as his capacity forviolence, his underworld missions to Cuba, and his familiarity with the Dallaspolice, Blakey concluded, “Whatever else may be inferred from Ruby’s conduct inthe summer and fall of 1963, it at least established that he was an availablemeans to effect Oswald’s elimination.”The Shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald [Contents.html#rsec78]The Warren Commission—and hence the news media—reported in 1963–1964 that theshooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby was the spontaneous act of agrief-stricken man who was concerned with the possibility of Mrs. Kennedy havingto return to Dallas to testify against Oswald. Today that story, still repeatedin the news media, has been shown to be a lie and a legal ploy.Less than three hours after shooting Oswald, Ruby was visited by Dallas attorneyTom Howard. Months later during his trial, Ruby scribbled a note to attorney JoeH. Tonahill saying, “Joe, you should know this. Tom Howard told me to say that Ishot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn’t have to come to Dallas totestify. Okay?”Ruby also admitted this ploy to attorney Melvin Belli, as recorded in his book,Dallas Justice. Belli wrote that Ruby told him, “We know I did it for Jackie andthe kids. . . . Maybe I ought to forget this silly story that I’m telling, andget on the stand and tell the truth.”These confessions coupled with Ruby’s movements during the assassination weekendall portray a man who consciously stalked Oswald—propelled by motives that werenot his own—before finally shooting him in the basement of the Dallas policestation.According to information developed by both the Warren Commission and the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations, Ruby awoke about 9:30 a.m. on the day of theassassination and drove to the offices of the Dallas Morning News, where hetried to visit entertainment columnist Tony Zoppi. Failing to find Zoppi, Rubysaid, he went to the paper’s advertising office and began to compose ad copy forhis club.Ruby claimed to have remained at the paper from nearly 11 a.m. until well afterthe assassination and several News employees, such as John Newnam and WandaWalker, confirmed this. However, all the accounts of Ruby at the newspapercontain gaps when he was out of sight. One reporter told the FBI that Ruby was“missed for a period of about twenty to twenty-five minutes” before reappearingshortly after the assassination.According to Ruby, he drove back to the Carousel Club after learning of theassassination at the newspaper. However, club employee Andrew Armstrong laterstated that Ruby did not come to the club until nearly 2 p.m. and severalwitnesses placed Ruby at Parkland Hospital.Ruby made several phone calls from the Carousel Club that afternoon and wasvisibly upset, according to employees’ accounts.He claimed he left the club late in the afternoon, but was seen in the crowdedDallas police headquarters between 4 and 4:30 p.m. Various persons, including areporter and policemen, placed Ruby at the police station at different placesand times between 4 and 7:30 p.m.By 9 p.m., according to phone records, Ruby was back at his apartment, and at 10p.m., he visited a Dallas synagogue.Shortly after 11 p.m. Ruby was back at Dallas police headquarters armed withabout a dozen sandwiches he had bought to give to officers.One officer has even told Texas researchers he saw Ruby enter Captain Fritz’soffice while Oswald was undergoing interrogation.Ruby was still there shortly after midnight when Oswald was taken to a basementassembly room for a news conference. Mingling with news reporters, Ruby ended upin the rear of the room, where he elbowed his way onto a table past newsphotographer Tony Record. Record later said he thought Ruby was a fellow newsmanbut could not understand his insistence on standing on the table when he didn’tcarry a camera.It was during this news conference that a singular incident occurred that manyresearchers have pointed to as evidence of Ruby’s intimate knowledge of Oswaldand his activities. Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade, in briefing newsreporters about Oswald’s background, stated he belonged to the Free CubaCommittee, whereupon Ruby corrected Wade by shouting out, “Henry, that’s theFair Play for Cuba Committee.”While Ruby later claimed to have heard of Oswald’s Fair Play for Cuba Committeeaffiliation over a local radio station that afternoon, it nevertheless struckresearchers as most odd that this nightclub owner with no known politics wouldnote the difference between the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee and thepro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Of course, this knowledge would notseem at all odd if the accounts of a Ruby-Oswald relationship are true.The midnight news conference was tumultuous and if Ruby’s plan was to silenceOswald there, there was never a clear shot.The remainder of the night Ruby was a nervous bundle of activity. He reportedlyhelped arrange a radio interview for District Attorney Wade, brought sandwichesand drinks to news personnel at KLIF radio, and sometime after 2 a.m. drovearound downtown encountering one of his strippers, Kay Coleman (known as KathyKay) with Dallas policeman Harry Olsen. During this supposedly chance meeting,Ruby was exhorted to move against Oswald, if his account can be believed. Hetold the Warren Commission:They talked and they carried on, and they thought I was the greatest guy in theworld, and he stated they should cut this guy [Oswald] into ribbons, and so on.And she said, “Well, if he was in England, they would drag him through thestreets and would have hung him.” . . . They kept me from leaving. They wereconstantly talking and were in a pretty dramatic mood. They were crying andcarrying on.All in all, even considering that much of what is known of Ruby’s movementsduring that weekend is confusing and contradictory, the man evidently was in anervous, anxious condition and touching bases all over town—especially theDallas police station, where Oswald was being held.The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, “These sightings, alongwith the one on Friday night, could indicate that Ruby was pursuing Oswald’smovements throughout the weekend.”Jack Ruby’s Warnings [Contents.html#rsec79]And it was in the early morning hours of November 24, 1963, that Ruby may havetried to avert his rapidly approaching confrontation with Oswald. Even theWarren Commission noted this strange incident by reporting, “Between 2:30 and 3a.m., the local office of the FBI and the sheriff’s office received telephonecalls from an unidentified man who warned that a committee had decided ‘to killthe man that killed the President.’ . . . The police department and ultimatelyChief Curry were informed of both threats.”What the public was not told was that the man who took one of the callsrecognized the voice of Jack Ruby. Dallas police lieutenant Billy R. Grammer wasa young officer working in the communications room early on November 24, 1963. Aman called and asked to know who was on duty that morning. After hearingGrammer’s name, the caller asked to speak with him. Refusing to give hisname—the caller said cryptically, “I can’t tell you that, but you know me”—theman described in detail to Grammer the plans to transfer Oswald, even to the useof a decoy vehicle, and added, “You’re going to have to make some other plans orwe’re going to kill Oswald right there in the basement.” Grammer and hissuperior took the warning seriously to the extent of writing up a report forChief Curry.Later in the morning Grammer was awakened by his wife, who told him that JackRuby had just shot Oswald in the basement of the police station. A stunnedGrammer told his wife that he suddenly realized that the familiar voice on thephone was Ruby’s. In 1988, Grammer told British television that he remainedconvinced that the caller was Ruby—especially in light of a chance meeting andconversation he had with Ruby in a restaurant near police headquarters only aweek before the call.Of course, if the caller was Ruby and if he did have inside knowledge of theOswald transfer, then it is clear that Oswald’s shooting was premeditated andinvolved others.[images/line.jpg]Despite these clear warnings and a few minor changes in the transfer plans as aresult, the execution of Oswald went off according to plan.Ruby told the FBI and the Warren Commission that he remained at his apartmentuntil after 10 a.m. on that Sunday when he left to mail a money order to LynnCarlin, but several witnesses and a call from a cleaning lady seem to belie thatnotion.Ruby’s roommate George Senator also tried to say that Ruby was home in the earlymorning but his story proved inconsistent and even the Warren Commissionexpressed suspicions about it.As early as 8 a.m. Warren Richey, a cameraman for WBAP-TV in nearby Fort Worth,reported seeing a man that he was “positive, pretty sure in my own mind” wasJack Ruby in front of the Dallas police station. Richey’s observation wascorroborated by two other WBAP newsmen, Ira Walker and John Smith. Smith alsosaw the man about 8 a.m. and, with Walker, about 10 a.m. when the same manapproached them and asked, “Has [Oswald] been brought down yet?”The three newsmen were amazed a short time later when Ruby’s mug shot wasbroadcast over the air. Walker told the Warren Commission, “Well, about four ofus pointed at him at the same time in the [mobile broadcast] truck, I mean, weall recognized him at the same time.” Characteristically, the Warren Commissiondownplayed the testimony and suggested the men were all mistaken, choosingrather to believe Ruby.The Commission also failed to seriously consider the statements of Ray Rushing,a Plano, Texas, preacher who had tried to visit Oswald at the police stationthat morning. Shortly after Oswald’s death, Rushing told Dallas policelieutenant Jack Revill that he had held a brief conversation with Ruby about9:30 a.m. during a ride in a police station elevator. In his report, Revillevaluated Rushing as “truthful” but noted that District Attorney Wade “didn’tneed [Rushing’s] testimony, because he had placed Ruby there the morning of theshooting.”Was Ruby at his apartment as he claimed or skulking about the police station? Acall from a cleaning woman has been used to show that he was indeed home.However, consider the call, made by sixty-year-old Elnora Pitts, who cleanedRuby’s apartment every Sunday. Pitts called sometime just after 8 a.m. November24. She told the Warren Commission she called each Sunday to verify whether sheshould work that day.She said a man answered and she identified herself but the man didn’t seem torecognize her name or the fact that she was to clean the apartment. Finally theman said, “Yes, you can come, but you call me.” “That’s what I’m doing now,”replied the exasperated Pitts. By now the woman was frightened by this man, whodidn’t seem to know her. She also said the man “sounded terrible strange to me.. . . He never did sound like himself.”But regardless of where Jack Ruby was earlier on Sunday morning, he wasdefinitely in the Western Union office just down the street from the policestation at 11:17 a.m. That is the time stamped on Ruby’s receipt for a $25 moneyorder, which he was sending to Karen Carlin in Fort Worth. Carlin, who also hadworked for Pat Kirkwood’s Cellar in Fort Worth, told Dallas police she hadtalked to Ruby earlier that morning and that Ruby obviously was very upset.The time Ruby sent the money order was only four minutes from the time he shotOswald. For years, supporters of the official version of the assassination haveargued that if Ruby intended to shoot Oswald, he could not have known thatOswald’s jail transfer would be delayed almost an hour and he would not havesent the money order. Therefore, they say, Ruby’s shooting of Oswald must havebeen a spontaneous act.Most serious researchers now understand that the shooting of Oswald was notpredicated on Ruby’s knowing the exact time of his transfer, but ratherconversely that Oswald was transferred only after Ruby was in a position toshoot him.This idea of a conspiracy to silence Oswald is based on several known facts. Oneof the most tantalizing of these is the story told by respected reporter SethKantor, author of Who Was Jack Ruby? According to Kantor, George Senator, Ruby’sroommate, was at the Eatwell Café near the police station the morning Ruby shotOswald. Reportedly Senator went to a pay phone and called Dallas attorney JimMartin, whom he asked to represent his friend Ruby for murdering the accusedassassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.Minutes later news came over the radio that Oswald had been shot. Ruby’sroommate had arranged legal representation before the event.Other facts pointing to a conspiracy to kill Oswald include that Ruby was in andout of the police station the entire weekend, stalking Oswald; Ruby (or someone)tried to warn the authorities of Oswald’s death, even relating specific policeprecautions; and both the mob and the federal government had enough leverage onRuby to force him to such an act.Only a minute or so before the Oswald shooting, Ruby’s initial lawyer, TomHoward—the one who cooked up his concern over Mrs. Kennedy as a motive—enteredthe police station and peered through the basement jail office window just asOswald was being taken off the elevator. Dallas detective H. L. McGee later thatday reported, “At this time, Oswald was brought off the jail elevator and TomHoward turned away from the window and went back toward the Harwood Street door.He waved at me as he went by and said, ‘That’s all I wanted to see.’ Shortlyafter that I heard a shot.”Detective Jim Leavelle, one of the men handcuffed to Oswald, told this author henever understood the reason for the nearly one-hour delay in transferringOswald, but that captain Will Fritz gave him the order to move just afterconferring with FBI and Secret Service officials. Leavelle said he had beenstanding around still handcuffed to Oswald for nearly an hour past the announcedmovement time when Fritz turned from the federal officers and said,“Everything’s all set. Take him down.”In 1963–1964, the federal government in the form of the Warren Commissionoffered a simple explanation for Oswald’s death. It stated that Ruby strolleddown the police department’s Main Street ramp to the basement minutes aftermailing the money order and, by sheer happenstance, arrived within shootingdistance of Oswald.The House Select Committee on Assassinations turned history around by concludingthatRuby probably did not come down the ramp, and that his most likely route was analleyway located next to the Dallas Municipal Building and a stairway leading tothe basement garage of police headquarters. . . . Ruby’s shooting of Oswald wasnot a spontaneous act in that it involved at least some premeditation.Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered thepolice basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have beenprovided with no knowledge of Ruby’s intentions. . . . The Committee wastroubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and theremoval of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairwayshortly before the shooting. . . . There is also evidence that the Dallas PoliceDepartment withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerningRuby’s entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.Ruby himself appeared to support the idea of police aid in reaching Oswald whenhe told the Warren Commission, “Who else could have timed it so perfectly byseconds. If it were timed that way, then someone in the police department isguilty of giving the information as to when Lee Harvey Oswald was coming down.”Then there are the words of mob boss Johnny Roselli. According to columnist JackAnderson, Roselli once told him, “When Oswald was picked up, the underworldconspirators feared he would crack and disclose information that might lead tothem. This almost certainly would have brought a massive U.S. crackdown on theMafia. So Jack Ruby was ordered to eliminate Oswald.”Studying the films of the Oswald shooting has given researchers valuable insightinto what happened—particularly a film still held by WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. Thestation was the NBC affiliate in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex and on November24, 1963, had a remote truck and cameras at the Dallas police station.One camera was set up across the Main Street ramp driveway and was running morethan thirty minutes before Oswald’s arrival in the basement. The transfer,originally set for about 10:30 a.m., was delayed by further questioning ofOswald in Fritz’s office. Oswald finally arrived in the basement about 11:20a.m. He was shot moments later. The camera continued filming long after theshooting.This documentary of the incident is intriguing seen in its entirety:About a quarter of an hour prior to Oswald’s arrival, a car moves out of thebasement garage area and up the Main Street ramp. Its horn is sounded loudly asa warning to people on the sidewalk above. Newsmen and police, both uniformedand plainclothes, mill about in expectation. Then more than a minute or sobefore Oswald arrives, another horn blows but the sound is more muted,indicating that the car may be farther back in the garage area. Moments later,the jail elevator doors open and Oswald is brought out. “Here he comes,” shoutthe newsmen, crowding up toward the jail office door. Police push them backforming a corridor through the crowd. One reporter jams a microphone nearOswald’s face and shouts, “Do you have anything to say in your defense?” Just atthat moment, Jack Ruby moves in from behind the camera and shoves his.38-caliber snub-nosed revolver into Oswald’s stomach. The bang is quite audibleand Oswald cries out in pain.Police immediately swarm over Ruby, knocking him to the floor. One of them callsout, “Jack, you son of a bitch!” Both Oswald and Ruby are hustled back into thejail office while stunned newsmen are reporting, “Oswald has been shot! Oswaldhas been shot!” Soon these reporters are interviewing the officers who, momentsbefore, had been standing unnoticed beside them. Their questions tumble out,“What happened? Did you know that man? Where did he come from?” Their responsesare intriguing. More than a couple indicated that they indeed recognized JackRuby but they declined to give his name or say more. More than one officer sayshe thought Oswald’s assailant came from the vicinity of a green car parked backin the police garage.Taken in total, this film of the shooting indicates that Ruby came through theparked cars in the basement and may have paused near a green car, perhaps thevery car that sounded its horn moments before Oswald was brought down. Someresearchers believe this horn honk may have been a signal to move Oswald becauseRuby was in position.The film also indicates that many of the officers in the police basementrecognized Ruby right away.Detective Leavelle told this author he both recognized Ruby and saw the gun inhis hand as he stepped from the crowd of reporters, but that he was powerless todo anything in the split second it took to shoot Oswald. Leavelle recalled theshooting:Out of the comer of my eye I saw Ruby step out from the crowd. He was crouchedand he had a pistol. He took a couple of steps and pulled that trigger. Ruby wasaiming dead center at Oswald. I had a grip on the top of Oswald’s trousers. WhenI saw Ruby, I tried to jerk Oswald aside to get him out of the way. I succeededin turning him. The bullet hit him in the side rather than straight into thestomach.Oswald was pushed to the floor by Leavelle while detective L. C. Graves on theopposite side of Oswald grabbed Ruby. Graves told researcher Edward Oxford:By the time Ruby got that shot off, why I had him down. His hand was stillflexing. I was saying to him, “Turn it loose! Turn it loose!” I pried his fingeroff the trigger. He was still trying to work it. Empty the gun into Oswald, Iexpect, if he could. Officers were jumping on Ruby to get him to the floor.Oswald said, “Owww!” and fell back. That was the last thing he ever said.Researchers over the years have been struck by an odd fact. Part of the plan forsecurity in the transfer involved focusing attention on an armored car that newsreporters were told would carry Oswald to the county jail. The armored car was adecoy. Oswald was to have been transported in an unmarked police car, which wasonly feet from where he was shot.Yet rather than load Oswald into the police car standing by and rush him to ahospital, the mortally wounded prisoner was taken back into the jail officewhere police gave him artificial respiration while waiting for an ambulance toarrive.Ruby’s one shot had been remarkably efficient. It transversed Oswald’s lowerabdomen, rupturing two main arteries carrying blood to the heart, and torethrough the spleen, pancreas, liver, and right kidney.Obviously, pumping Oswald’s chest was the worst possible reaction to theinternal bleeding the abdominal wound had caused.Chief Curry, who had been told to remain in his office for a call from MayorCabell, finally arrived in the basement. He noted when the ambulance arrived,“Oswald was already white as a sheet and looked dead as he was loaded on astretcher.”Oswald was taken to Parkland Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.[images/line.jpg]Meanwhile, Jack Ruby had been hustled out of the police basement and taken,ironically enough, to the jail cell that Oswald had just vacated. Ruby asked hiscaptors, “What happened?” He displayed an odd inability to recall the Oswaldshooting with any clarity.One of the auto-theft detectives in charge of placing Ruby in jail was struck byhis strange behavior immediately after the shooting. Don Ray Archer told Britishtelevision in 1988:His behavior to begin with was very hyper. He was sweating profusely. I couldsee his heart beating. We had stripped him down for security purposes. He askedme for one of my cigarettes. I gave him a cigarette. Finally after about twohours had elapsed . . . the head of the Secret Service came up and I conferredwith him and he told me that Oswald . . . had died. This should have shocked[Ruby] because it would mean the death penalty. I returned and said, “Jack, itlooks like it’s going to be the electric chair for you.” Instead of beingshocked, he became calm, he quit sweating, his heart slowed down. I asked him ifhe wanted a cigarette and he advised me he didn’t smoke. I was just astonishedat this complete difference of behavior from what I had expected. I would sayhis life had depended on him getting Oswald.On November 27, 1963, a Dallas grand jury indicted Jack Ruby for Oswald’smurder.There was never any doubt he did it. After all, only a handful of Americansfailed to see what undoubtedly was the most widely viewed homicide in history.The networks ran replays of the shooting over and over. Because of thispublicity, a change-of-venue hearing was conducted on February 10, 1964, butchanging the location of Ruby’s trial was denied. Jury selection began onFebruary 17 and ended on March 3. The trial began the next day.Ten days later, on March 14, 1964, the jury—eight men and four women—returned aguilty verdict, with the judge handing down a death sentence. The verdict wasappealed.Many people considered Ruby a hero for eliminating Kennedy’s presumed assassin.Cards and letters—even money—came from all over. Ruby’s attorney Tom Howardechoed their sentiment when he stated, “I think Ruby deserves a congressionalmedal.”But despite the favorable pretrial publicity, Ruby never had much of a chance inthe Dallas of those days. As right-wing assistant district attorney BillAlexander explained to newsman Seth Kantor, “Jack Ruby was about as handicappedas you can get in Dallas. First he was a Yankee. Second, he was a Jew. Third, hewas in the nightclub business.”To appeal to the mind-set of Dallas at that time, attorney Joe Tonahill wasasked to join in his defense. Tonahill had the east Texas drawl and the ruralmannerisms more acceptable to a Dallas jury.But the heavyweight of Ruby’s defense was flamboyant San Franciscosuper-attorney Melvin Belli, who quickly set himself at odds with the down-homeprovincialism of Dallas.Belli’s avenue of defense was to have Ruby declared a victim of “temporaryinsanity” due to “psychomotor epilepsy.” To this end, Belli put a string ofpsychiatrists on the stand to testify. It also meant that he would not allowRuby to take the stand on his own behalf.This failure to allow Ruby to testify, coupled with the tight security in theDallas County Jail, effectively kept Ruby isolated from the news media and thepublic. Ruby even cautioned his few visitors to the jail that his conversationswere being recorded and monitored.The only reporter to get a private interview with Ruby during his trial in March1964 was nationally syndicated columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, who prevailed onlawyer Tonahill to arrange the meeting with presiding judge Joe B. Brown. Sheclaimed to have a message for Ruby from a mutual friend who “may have been somekind of singer.”Judge Brown, impressed with the famous Broadway newspaperwoman, agreed and,according to Kilgallen biographer Lee Israel, the pair met in a small officebehind the judge’s bench without the four sheriff’s deputies who were always atRuby’s side. Israel wrote, “They were together privately for about eight minutesin what may have been the only safe house Ruby had occupied since his arrest.”Although Kilgallen mentioned this unique private meeting with Ruby to closefriends, she did not publicly write about it. The fact that she did not publiclydisclose what she learned in this meeting prompted biographer Israel to write:That she withheld suggests strongly that she was either saving the informationfor her book, Murder One, a chapter of which she had decided to devote to theRuby trial; that he furnished her with a lead which she was actively pursuing;that he exacted a promise of confidentiality from her; or that she was actingmerely as a courier. Each possibility puts her in the thick of things.Israel also records that toward the end of her life, Kilgallen may have obtainedinside assassination information from yet another source. He wrote, “Dorothybegan to draw drinking companions to her. Joan Crawford . . . was among them.She tooled around with Crawford. . . . They boozed abundantly together in theback of Crawford’s touring car, which was well stocked with hundred-proofvodka.”Upon her husband’s death, Crawford had become a principal owner of Pepsi-Cola,the firm that counted Richard Nixon as an attorney. Both Nixon and Crawford hadbeen in Dallas the week of the assassination and may have been privy to insideinformation.Whatever information Kilgallen learned and from whatever source, it fired herdesire to solve the JFK assassination. She told attorney Mark Lane, “They’vekilled the President, [and] the government is not prepared to tell us the truth”and that she planned to “break the case.” To other friends she said, “This hasto be a conspiracy! [The Warren Commission is] laughable. . . . I’m going tobreak the real story and have the biggest scoop of the century.” And in her lastcolumn item regarding the assassination, published on September 3, 1965,Kilgallen wrote, “This story isn’t going to die as long as there’s a realreporter alive—and there are a lot of them.”But on November 8, 1965, there was one less reporter. That day Dorothy Kilgallenwas found dead in her home. It was initially reported that she died of a heartattack, but quickly this was changed to an overdose of alcohol and pills. Herdeath certificate, dated November 15, 1965, stated the cause of death was “acuteethanol and barbiturate intoxication—circumstances undetermined.”Israel later wrote, “After three years of investigating the events surroundingDorothy’s death, it is clear to me that she did not die accidentally and that anetwork of varied activities, impelled by disparate purposes, conspiredeffectively to obfuscate the truth.”No trace of her notes or writings about what she may have learned from Ruby orCrawford was ever found.During Ruby’s trial, Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade made a strongcase for premeditation but carefully skirted the issue of conspiracy. Heexplained that he was given instructions from Johnson’s aide Cliff Carter, whocalled from Washington at least three times on Friday afternoon: “Any word of aconspiracy . . . to kill President Kennedy would shake our nation to itsfoundation. President Johnson was worried about some conspiracy on the part ofthe Russians [saying] it would hurt foreign relations if I alleged aconspiracy—whether I could prove it or not—I was to charge Oswald with plainmurder.”But according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram of March 18, 1964, Wade’s “bigdecision” later was to not call witnesses “who insisted they had seen Ruby andOswald together at various times.”A parade of police witnesses recalled various remarks Ruby reportedly made atthe time of the shooting, such as:You rotten son of a bitch, you shot the President. . . . I intended to get offthree shots. . . . I did it because you [the police] couldn’t do it. . . . I didit to show the world that Jews have guts. . . . I first thought of killing himat the Friday night press conference.It was such publicized statements as these, as well as Judge Brown’s refusal ofa change of venue, that prompted the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to reverseRuby’s conviction on October 5, 1966. The appeals court ordered a new trial butRuby did not live to see it.Although Ruby was not allowed to testify at his trial, he was interviewed by theWarren Commission on June 7, 1964. Representing the Warren Commission were USSupreme Court chief justice Earl Warren and representative Gerald R. Ford alongwith general counsel J. Lee Rankin and staff attorneys Arlen Specter and JosephBall. Also present were attorneys Leon Jaworski and Robert G. Storey, who wereacting as liaisons between the Commission and Texas authorities; Secret Serviceagent Elmer W. Moore; Dallas County assistant district attorney Jim Bowie;sheriff Bill Decker; Ruby attorney Joe Tonahill; and several Dallas policeofficers.Oddly enough, due to an internal squabble over the handling of Dallas witnesses,the two Commission staffers who were in charge of the Ruby investigation—LeonHubert and Burt Griffin—were not allowed to sit in on this important interview.During this interview, Ruby vacillated. After about an hour of a ramblingaccount of his activities prior to shooting Oswald and some rather innocuousquestions, it appeared that Warren was ready to wrap up the interview.Apparently sensing this, Ruby said, “You can get more out of me. Let’s not breakup too soon.”Ford then began questioning Ruby about his trips to Cuba in 1959, but just asthe answers appeared to be leading into fruitful territory, Warren cut Ford offand changed the subject.Tonahill later told newsman Seth Kantor, “Ford never did finish hisinterrogation on Cuba. Warren blocked Ford out on it. That was very impressive,I thought. Ford gave him a hard look, too. I was sitting right there and saw ithappen.”Ruby became desperate, pleading:Gentlemen, my life is in danger here. . . . Do I sound sober enough to you as Isay this? . . . Then follow this up. I may not live tomorrow to give any furthertestimony. . . . The only thing I want to get out to the public, and I can’t sayit here, is with authenticity, with sincerity of the truth of everything and whymy act was committed, but it can’t be said here. . . . Chairman Warren, if youfelt that your life was in danger at the moment, how would you feel? Wouldn’tyou be reluctant to go on speaking, even though you request me to do so?Having previously voiced the suspicion that his words and actions were beingmonitored in Dallas, Ruby then asked to be taken out of his presentcircumstances, saying, “Gentlemen, if you want to hear any further testimony,you will have to get me to Washington soon, because it has something to do withyou, Chief Warren. . . . I want to tell the truth and I can’t tell it here. Doesthat make sense to you?”Ruby begged to be taken to Washington, away from Dallas, at least eight times.He complained that his “life was in danger. . . . [My] whole family is injeopardy.” He was shrugged off by Warren, who replied, “There are a good manythings involved in that, Mr. Ruby.”Asked to explain, Warren replied, “Well, the public attention that it wouldattract, and the people who would be around. We have no place for you to be safewhen we take you out, and we are not law enforcement officers, and it isn’t ourresponsibility to go into anything of that kind. And certainly it couldn’t bedone on a moment’s notice this way.”Ruby grew more blunt:If you don’t take me back to Washington tonight to give me a chance to prove tothe President that I am not guilty, then you will see the most tragic thing thatwill ever happen. And if you don’t have the power to take me back, I won’t bearound to be able to prove my innocence or guilt. . . . All I know is maybesomething can be saved. Because right now, I want to tell you this. I am used asa scapegoat. . . . Now maybe something can be saved. It may not be too late,whatever happens, if our President, Lyndon Johnson, knew the truth from me. Butif I am eliminated, there won’t be any way of knowing.Asked if he knew Officer Tippit, he replied that “there was three Tippits on theforce” but he knew only one and didn’t think he was the murdered policeman.Incredibly, no one followed up on this to find out which Tippit Ruby did knowand how he knew it wasn’t the murdered officer. To this author’s knowledge,there were no other Tippits on the police force at that time.Then Rankin asked him about a rumor that Ruby had been seen in the Carousel Clubshortly before the assassination with a Mr. Weissman—the man who had paid for ananti-Kennedy newspaper ad—Officer Tippit, and a rich Dallas oilman.Ruby said the story was untrue, then may have uttered an ironic truth. Lookingaround the room, he proclaimed, “I am as innocent regarding any conspiracy asany of you gentlemen in the room.”As early as December 1963, Ruby had asked to be given a lie detector test,perhaps reasoning that such a test would bring out the truth by revealing hisaccount of events to be false. During his meeting with Warren he again begged tobe given a polygraph test and the Commission dutifully agreed. A polygraph testwas administered to Ruby on July 18, 1964, and his answers did not indicate hewas lying. These test results have been used during the years to support thecontention that Ruby was not part of any conspiracy and shot Oswald only out ofpersonal motives.Few people bothered to read the last page of the Warren Report, where inAppendix XVII, J. Edgar Hoover commented:It should be pointed out that the polygraph, often referred to as “lie detector”is not in fact such a device. . . . During the proceedings at Dallas, Texas, onJuly 18, 1964, Dr. William R. Beavers, a psychiatrist, testified that he wouldgenerally describe Jack Ruby as a “psychotic depressive.” In view of the seriousquestion raised as to Ruby’s mental condition, no significance should be placedon the polygraph examination and it should be considered nonconclusive as thecharts cannot be relied upon.Apparently unwilling or unable to see that Ruby was desperately trying to tellthem something outside the surveillance of Dallas authorities, the WarrenCommission entourage prepared to leave Ruby’s interview. Failure to fullyquestion Jack Ruby was one of the Commission’s greatest mistakes—if it was amistake.A resigned Ruby told them, “Well, you won’t ever see me again. I tell you that.. . . A whole new form of government is going to take over the country, and Iknow I won’t live to see you another time.”He didn’t.The Sudden Death of Jack Ruby [Contents.html#rsec80]In the days following his trial and interview by the Warren Commission, JackRuby’s moods went from confident highs to suicidal lows. A prisoner with fewopportunities to communicate with the outside, Ruby nevertheless was given therun of sheriff Bill Decker’s jail. He reportedly was able to roam freely,occasionally use the telephone, and even sleep in a corridor. But at all timeshe was under close guard, especially after several inept suicide attempts.On one occasion he tried to hang himself but there was not enough time to riphis clothing and fashion a knot before a guard got to him. Another time, Rubybecame so despondent he tried to split his skull by running headlong into awall. This attempt merely left him with a large knot on his head.His most pathetic attempt took place when a guard went off for a drink of water.Quickly Ruby unscrewed an overhead lightbulb, then threw water from his ownglass onto his feet as a conduit. However, he couldn’t reach the light socketwith his finger while standing in the water. His guard, deputy sheriff JessStevenson, found him ineffectually jumping up and down trying to complete thecircuit. The attempt was “something nearly comical,” Stevenson told newsman SethKantor.As time dragged on and his isolation began to take its toll, Ruby became moredespondent. His mood worsened after he came to believe that Stevenson, who hadchatted at length with the prisoner after preaching the Bible to him, actuallywas passing information gleaned through their conversations back to Dallasauthorities.Long after the Warren Commission had issued its report in the fall of 1964,while waiting for the outcome of his conviction appeal, Ruby apparently wrote asixteen-page letter to a fellow prisoner who was leaving the jail. Ruby askedthe prisoner to memorize names and facts in the letter, then destroy it. Theprisoner, identified only as “John,” decided instead to sell the letter, and itended up in the hands of longtime researcher Penn Jones. Jones purchased theletter from New York autograph dealer Charles Hamilton, who had the documentappraised as authentic.The letter is disjointed, rambling, and full of references to Nazis, the deathof Jews, and, most intriguing, derogatory references to Lyndon Johnson. Manyresearchers, as improbable as it seems, feel Ruby’s letter, though written in astate of questionable mental equilibrium, laid bare some of his secret knowledgeand fears. He wrote:First, you must realize that the people here want everyone to think I am crazy,so if what I know is actually [sic], and then no one will believe me, because ofmy supposed insanity. Now, I know that my time is running out . . . they plan ondoing away with [me]. . . . As soon as you get out you must read Texan looks atLyndon [A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study in Illegitimate Power, by J. EvettsHaley] and it might open your eyes to a lot of things. This man [Johnson] is aNazi in the worst order. For over a year now they have been doing away with mypeople. . . . Don’t believe the Warren report, that was only put out to make melook innocent in that it would throw the Americans and all the Europeancountry’s [sic] off guard. . . . There are so many things that have been playedwith success that it would take all nite [sic] to write them out. . . . Therewouldn’t be any purpose of my writing you all of this unless you were convincedof how much I loved my country. . . . I am going to die a horrible death anyway,so what would I have to gain by writing all this. So you must believe me. . . .Johnson is going to try to have an all-out war with Russia and when thathappens, Johnson and his cohorts will be on the side-lines where they won’t gethurt, while the Americans may get wiped out. The only way this can be avoided isthat if Russia would be informed as to [who] the real enemies are, and in thatway they won’t be tricked into starting a war with the U.S. . . . One morething, isn’t it strange that Oswald who hasn’t worked a lick most of his life,should be fortunate enough to get a job at the Book Bldg. two wks. before thepresident himself didn’t know as to when he was to visit Dallas, now where woulda jerk like Oswald get the information that the president was coming to Dallas.Only one person could have had that information, and that man was Johnson whoknew weeks in advance as to what was going to happen because he is the one whowas going to arrange the trip for the president, this had been planned longbefore the president himself knew about [it], so you figure that one out. Theonly one who gained by the shooting of the president was Johnson, and he was ina car in the rear and safe when the shooting took place. What would theRussians, Castro or anyone else have to gain by eliminating the president? IfJohnson was so heartbroken over Kennedy, why didn’t he do something for RobertKennedy? All he did was snub him.In a second letter smuggled out of the Dallas County Jail, Ruby was more bluntin his accusations. He wrote:They found some very clever means and ways to trick me and which will be usedlater as evidence to show the American people that I was part of the conspiracyin the assassination of [the] president, and I was used to silence Oswald. . . .They alone planned the killing, by they, I mean Johnson and others. . . . Readthe book Texas Looks At Lyndon [another reference to Haley’s book] and you maylearn quite a bit about Johnson and how he has fooled everyone. . . . In all thehistory of the U.S. never has a president been elected that has the backgroundof Johnson. Believe me, compared to him I am a Saint.Not long before his death, Ruby was interviewed by psychiatrist Werner Teuter.Perhaps realizing his end was near, Ruby told Teuter the assassination was “anact of overthrowing the government” and that he knew “who had President Kennedykilled.” He added, “I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. Iwas framed to kill Oswald.”These comments will always intrigue researchers. Was Ruby merely speculating orwere his messages born of secret knowledge? Did he know that Johnson and thepeople behind him wanted war—only mistaking Russia for Asia? And were hiswarnings of Nazis taking over rooted somewhere in a knowledge of the mentalityof the people he knew were behind the assassination? A Nazi connection to theassassination is both well documented and considerable. See The Rise of theFourth Reich by this author.Or were his missives only the delusions of a man unhinged by his captivity andthe belief that forces were out to destroy him?The answer may be found in a study of Ruby’s mysterious death.The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Ruby’s conviction on October 5,1966, and ordered a new trial. On December 7, 1966, his new trial was orderedmoved from Dallas to Wichita Falls, a small Texas city near the Oklahoma border.There was every likelihood that within another month or two, Ruby would walkfree, as his time in jail would be counted against a probable short prison termfor murder without malice. He certainly would have been allowed to post bond andbecome accessible to the public.On December 9, 1966, two days after his new trial site had been announced, Rubywas moved from the Dallas County Jail to Parkland Hospital after complaining ofpersistent coughing and nausea.Doctors initially diagnosed his problem as “pneumonia.” The next day, however,the diagnosis was changed to cancer and within just a few more days, it wasannounced that Ruby’s cancer was too far advanced to be treated by surgery orradiation.On the evening of January 2, 1967, doctors suspected that blood clots wereforming and they administered oxygen and Ruby seemed to recover. But about 9a.m. the next day, he suffered a spasm and, despite emergency procedures, he waspronounced dead at 10:30 a.m. January 3, 1967.One of his attorneys told newsmen, “His death was a merciful release.”Shortly before his death, Ruby’s brother Earl smuggled a tape recorder intoParkland and later produced a short record that was sold to Capitol Records. Theproceeds from this record, in which Ruby simply reiterated the official accountof his actions—including his Cuban travels, which the House Select Committee onAssassinations proved false—was used to pay for his burial expenses. This recordalso once again put the public off the trail of evidence by repeating the samestory reported in 1963–1964.An autopsy by Dallas County medical examiner Dr. Earl Rose showed the heaviestconcentration of cancer cells in Ruby’s right lung. However, Dr. Rose determinedthe immediate cause of death was pulmonary embolism—a massive blood clot hadformed in a leg, passed through the heart, and lodged in Ruby’s lung. Ruby’sdoctors had said they believed his cancer had originated in the pancreas, butDr. Rose found Ruby’s pancreas perfectly normal.With the announcement of his inoperable cancer, there was immediate andwidespread suspicion that Ruby had been maneuvered into killing Oswald knowinghe had only a short time to live. Dr. Rose was asked by the House committee ifthere was any chance that Ruby could have known about his cancer in November1963. He said no.Yet questions remain.In the later summer of 1966, jail doctor Julian Mardock found Ruby was in goodhealth. But several weeks later he was told that he was no longer needed, as adoctor “down from Washington” would take over Ruby’s case.Deputy sheriff Al Maddox also mentioned the new doctor who arrived to attendRuby:We had a phony doctor come in to [the Dallas County Jail] from Chicago, just asphony and as queer as a three-dollar bill. And he worked his way in through—Idon’t know, whoever supplied the county at that time with doctors. . . . Youcould tell he was Ruby’s doctor. He spent half his time up there talking withRuby. And one day I went in and Ruby told me, he said, “Well, they injected mefor a cold.” He said it was cancer cells. That’s what he told me, Ruby did. Isaid you don’t believe that shit. He said, “I damn sure do!” I never saidanything to Decker or anybody. . . . [Then] one day when I started to leave,Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm. . . .[In this note] he said it was a conspiracy and he said . . . if you will keepyour eyes open and your mouth shut, you’re gonna learn a lot. And that was thelast letter I ever got from him.Maddox was not the only law-enforcement officer to suspect that Ruby’s death wasnot entirely natural. Policeman Tom Tilson told researchers, “It was the opinionof a number of other Dallas police officers that Ruby had received injections ofcancer while he was incarcerated in the Dallas County Jail following theshooting of Lee Harvey Oswald.”The new physician has been identified as none other than Dr. Louis Joyon “Jolly”West, professor and director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the Universityof California–Los Angeles. He also was a government expert on torture andbrainwashing who also turned up in the cases of Sirhan Sirhan and Patty Hearst.West’s name has cropped up in many reports and documents pertaining to thegovernment’s MK-ULTRA mind-control experiments and may also have been connectedto covert cancer research.According to a January 7, 1999, Reuters report, “After examining Ruby, thekiller of President John F. Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, Westconcluded Ruby was suffering from ‘major mental illness precipitated by thestress of [his] trial.’”Many researchers believe that Ruby’s cancer was induced, either by ingestion orinjection. At least one former Dallas law-enforcement officer offered a moremundane explanation for Ruby’s sudden and rampant cancer. He told this author,“Hell, it wasn’t any big deal. They just took Ruby in for X-rays and had himwait in the X-ray room. While he sat there for fifteen or twenty minutes ormore, they just left the X-ray machine on him.”Bruce McCarty operated an electron microscope at Southwest Medical School nearParkland. He told this author that he was called back to work during theholidays in 1966 to study Ruby’s cancer cells. McCarty explained that there aretwo types of cancer cells—cilia, which indicate an origin in the respiratorysystem, and microvilli, indicating an origin in the digestive system. Thesecells are difficult to differentiate with a regular microscope, hence the needfor his electron microscope.McCarty confirmed that Ruby’s cells were microvilli, indicating his canceroriginated in the digestive system. He was shocked when it was announced thatRuby died from lung cancer.Could Ruby have been injected with live cancer cells, which could account forthe presence of the microvilli? Traditional medical science has claimed this isimpossible but recall the account of just such a process as described by JudythVary Baker, who claimed to have met Ruby in New Orleans while working in DavidFerrie’s covert cancer lab.While none of this information establishes beyond doubt that Jack Ruby wassomehow eliminated through cancer, it certainly shows there is cause enough forresearchers to be highly suspicious of his sudden and convenient death.With the death of the two men who might have shed light on the lines ofcommunication within a plot to kill the president—Oswald and Ruby—researcherswere left only with a vast amount of evidence, much of which seems substantialuntil studied closely."},{"pageContent":"The Evidence [Contents.html#rch14]There has never been a lack of evidence in the assassination of PresidentKennedy. In addition to the several hundred witnesses in Dealey Plaza, there wasan abundance of film and still pictures as well as documentation and a greatdeal of physical evidence.In the hours following the assassination, this evidence grew to include a rifle,empty shell cases, a “sniper’s nest” and even a convincing—if belated—palm printon the suspected murder weapon.The rapid accumulation of evidence prompted Dallas County district attorneyHenry Wade to proclaim to the media he had an open-and-shut case against LeeHarvey Oswald the day after the shooting.However, a long and thoughtful look at most of the evidence reveals just as manyquestions and as much confusion as the medical evidence.The Warren Commission questioned 126 of the 266 known witnesses either bytestimony or affidavit. Regarding the source of the shots, thirty-eight gave noopinion—most were not asked—thirty-two indicated the Texas School BookDepository, and fifty-one placed the shots in the vicinity of the Grassy Knoll.Several believed shots were fired from locations other than those two.Even veteran law-enforcement officers, who should have been expected to provideexpert opinions as to the source of the shots, were divided in their beliefs. Ofthe twenty sheriff’s deputies watching the motorcade from in front of thesheriff’s office, sixteen placed the origin of the shots near the TripleUnderpass, three gave no opinion, and only one implied the Depository. Of twelveDallas policemen stationed in the plaza interviewed, four placed shots from theGrassy Knoll, four said shots came from the Depository, and four gave noopinion.While it is understood that eyewitness testimony cannot be relied on forabsolute truth, statements of otherwise ordinary citizens regarding secondgunmen, muzzle flashes, and smoke on the Grassy Knoll must be considered in anyimpartial desire to learn the truth.The best evidence would have been the medical reports. With a competent autopsy,it should have been well established how many bullets struck Kennedy and fromwhich direction. However, as discussed earlier, the medical evidence in thiscase continues to be a source of controversy—filled with inconsistencies,errors, missing items, and phony photographs and X-rays. About all one can sayfor certain based on the medical evidence is that Kennedy was shot at leasttwice.So it remains for other pieces of evidence—ballistic and physical evidence—toprove the official version of the assassination. Unfortunately, this area, too,is filled with doubts, questions, deceit, and ambiguity.Some of the first physical evidence to be found was in the Texas School BookDepository. Many of the press accounts at the time mentioned fingerprints tracedto Lee Harvey Oswald being found on boxes on the Depository’s sixth floor, theshield of boxes around a “sniper’s nest” in the southeast corner of that floor,and the remains of a chicken lunch discovered nearby.The presence of Oswald’s fingerprints on the sixth floor means nothing, since hewas a Depository employee and by all accounts had worked on the sixth floor thatday. Furthermore, it is clear that the Dallas police failed to follow even themost rudimentary methods of handling evidence. Of the nine fingerprints and fourpalm prints found on book boxes from the sixth floor, only one fingerprint andpalm print could be traced to Oswald. All remaining prints belonged to Dallaspoliceman R. L. Studebaker, FBI clerk Forest L. Lucy, or others, with a fewunidentified. In other words, the forensics evidence was a mess.The stacking of book boxes both around the sixth-floor window and on thewindowsill cannot be used as proof of Oswald’s guilt since there is no proof heplaced them and since it is now known that the entire “sniper’s nest” scene waslater staged for the official photographs.At least three Warren Commission photographs of the scene—Commission Exhibits509, 724, and 733—show three versions of the boxes stacked near the sixth-floorwindow. R. L. Studebaker, Dallas police photographer, told the Warren Commissionthat some of his photos were taken as late as the Monday following theassassination.Jack Beers, a photographer for the Dallas Morning News, took pictures of the“sniper’s nest” less than three hours after the assassination. His photos showyet a different configuration of boxes from that shown in the Commission photos.Dallas police lieutenant J. C. Day of the Crime Scene Search Unit admitted tothe Warren Commission that the boxes had been moved around. In Commissiontestimony, the following exchange took place between Day and Commission attorneyDavid Belin:BELIN: Were those boxes in the window the way you saw them, or had they beenreplaced in the window to reconstruct it?DAY: They had simply been moved in the processing for prints. They weren’t putback in any particular order.BELIN: So [the “sniper’s nest” photograph] does not represent, so far as theboxes are concerned, the crime scene when you first came to the sixth floor, isthat correct?DAY: That is correct.So the evidence of the “sniper’s nest” is virtually useless since even theDallas police crime scene official stated the boxes had been moved about.Unfortunately, it was the same story with the three cartridge hulls reportedlyfound on the sixth floor. Day said he took two photographs of the three hullslying near the sixth-floor window. Two hulls can been seen lying near to eachother on the floor beneath the windowsill while a third is some distance away.It has been assumed that this was the position of the hulls. However, todaythere is evidence that this evidence also was staged.Gary Mack, based on a 1985 interview with WFAA-TV cameraman Tom Alyea, wrote:[Alyea] managed to get inside the Texas School Book Depository before it wassealed by police. As he entered the building, Alyea heard someone shout, “Don’tlet anyone in or out!” Alyea reached the sixth floor and filmed Dallas policesearching for evidence. He said the federal authorities there were “bent ongetting me out of the place” and did not want him taking any film but hisfriendly local police contacts allowed him to stay. Alyea said he noticed shellslying on the floor but couldn’t film them because of book boxes in the way.Noting Alyea’s predicament, Captain Will Fritz scooped up the shells and heldthem in his hand for Alyea’s camera—then threw the hulls down on the floor. Allof this occurred before the crime scene search unit arrived. Alyea said film ofthe shells lying in their original positions on the floor was apparently thrownout with other unused news film on orders of his WFAA news director.Two lawmen on the sixth floor at the time—deputy sheriffs Roger Craig and LukeMooney—have told researchers they saw the three hulls lying side by side onlyinches apart under the window, all pointing in the same direction. Of coursethis position would be impossible if the shells had been normally ejected from arifle to the right rear. So the evidence of the empty shell cases becamesuspect.Just as a matter of speculation, it seems incredible that the assassin in theDepository would go to the trouble of trying to hide the rifle behind boxes onthe opposite side of the sixth floor from the southeast window and then leaveincriminating shells lying on the floor—unless, of course, the hulls weredeliberately left behind to incriminate Oswald.There is yet another problem with the empty rifle hulls. Although the WarrenCommission published a copy of the Dallas police evidence sheet showing threeshell cases were taken from the Depository, in later years a copy of that sameevidence sheet was found in the Texas Department of Public Safety files thatshowed only two cases were found. This is supported by the FBI receipt forassassination evidence from the Dallas police that indicates only two shellcases arrived in Washington just after the assassination.Reportedly Fritz held on to one of the cases for several days before forwardingit to the FBI. This breach of the chain of evidence causes suspicion to beraised about the legitimacy of the third shell. This suspicion is compounded bythe fact that while the FBI crime lab determined that two of the hulls show asmall dent, this anomaly was found only on shell cases loaded in the Oswaldrifle. The third casing showed no such evidence.In fact, the third hull—designated Commission Exhibit 543—had an indention onits lip that would have prevented the fitting of a slug. In its presentcondition, it could not have fired a bullet on that day.The FBI determined that Commission Exhibit 543 had been loaded and extractedfrom a weapon “at least three times” but could not specify that the weaponbelonged to Oswald. Some researchers speculate this shell may have been the oneused to fire the slug from the Oswald rifle that later turned up at ParklandHospital and has been designated as Commission Exhibit 399—the “magic bullet.”However, FBI experts said Commission Exhibit 543 did show marks from themagazine follower of Oswald’s rifle. What went unexplained was how these markswere made, since the magazine follower marks only the last cartridge in theclip. This position was occupied by a live round found that day, not byCommission Exhibit 543.Again, too many questions arise to accept the shell cases as legitimateevidence.The rifle reportedly belonging to Oswald also is surrounded by controversy andinconsistencies. The rifle found behind boxes on the sixth floor of theDepository was initially described as a 7.65 mm bolt-action German Mauser. Itwas described as such by deputy sheriff E. L. Boone, discoverer of the rifle, inhis report of that day. Boone’s report is supported by that of deputy constableSeymour Weitzman. Both lawmen reportedly had more than an average knowledge ofweapons.As late as the day after the assassination, Weitzman wrote in a report:I was working with Deputy Boone of the Sheriff’s Department and helping in thesearch. We were in the northwest corner of the sixth floor when Deputy Boone andmyself spotted the rifle about the same time. This rifle was a 7.65 Mauser boltaction equipped with a 4/18 scope, a thick leather brownish-black sling on it.The rifle was between some boxes near the stairway. The time the rifle was foundwas 1:22 p.m.This account was confirmed by Deputy Craig, who told Texas researchers heactually saw the word “Mauser” stamped on the weapon’s receiver. When askedabout the make of rifle shortly after midnight the day of the assassination,Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade replied, “It’s a Mauser, I believe.”However, by late Friday afternoon the rifle was being identified as a 6.5 mmItalian Carcano.While a German Mauser and the Carcano do look somewhat similar, anyone vaguelyfamiliar with these weapons—Weitzman, Boone, and Craig should certainlyqualify—can distinguish between them. Why the discrepancies? The WarrenCommission indicated that Weitzman was simply mistaken in his identification ofthe rifle and that the others, including Wade, probably repeated this mistakenidentification. However, Wade never gave any indication as to the source of hisidea that the rifle was a Mauser. And Boone told the Commission he thought itwas Captain Fritz who termed it a Mauser.Asked to identify the Carcano, Boone would only say, “It looks like the samerifle. I have no way of being positive.” Weitzman, who managed a sporting-goodsstore and was considered an expert on rifles, had identified the gun as aMauser. He testified to the Warren Commission only by affidavit and was notasked to identify the Carcano as the gun he held in the Depository.Author Sylvia Meagher noted, “The failure to obtain such corroboration fromWeitzman leaves open the possibility that a substitution of rifles took place,or that a second rifle may have been found at the Book Depository, but keptsecret.”Also consider that Lieutenant Day and another Dallas policeman mentioned writingcontemporary descriptions of the rifle, yet neither of these documents wasincluded in the mass of Warren Commission materials.Even the CIA had doubts as to the true identity of the assassination rifle. Fivedays after the assassination, in an internal report transmitted from Italy toLangley headquarters, CIA officials noted that two different kinds ofItalian-made carbines were being identified as the single murder weapon. The CIAdocument stated, “The weapon which appears to have been employed in thiscriminal attack is a Model 91 rifle, 7.35 caliber, 1938 modification. . . . Thedescription of a ‘Mannlicher-Carcano’ rifle in the Italian and foreign press isin error.”The possibility of a rifle substitution was even admitted by Dallas police chiefJesse Curry in 1976. In an interview with the Detroit News, Curry agreed “it’smore than possible” the rifle originally found in the Depository could have beenexchanged for the gun now in the National Archives. Curry said anyone wanting tosubstitute one suspected murder weapon for another “could have gotten away withit at the time” because no special precautions were taken to isolate the weaponas historic evidence.But even accepting that the Carcano was the assassination rifle, it is hard toenvision a worse weapon. In testimony to the Warren Commission—conveniently leftout of its report—FBI reports quoted firearms experts as calling the rifle “acheap old weapon,” “a very cheap rifle [which] could have been purchased for $3each in lots of 25,” and a “real cheap, common, real flimsy-looking [gun] . . .very easily knocked out of adjustment.”The FBI also noted that the Carcano was part of a gun shipment that was thesubject of “a legal proceeding by the Carlo Riva Machine Shop to collect paymentfor the shipment of rifles which Adam Consolidated Industries, Inc., claims weredefective.” A defective gun managed to strike two men with three shots at arange of more than two hundred feet within six seconds?There are many other questions concerning the rifle and its purchase.The Warren Commission published a “duplicate” of the ad from which Oswaldreportedly ordered the rifle from Klein’s Sporting Goods Co. of Chicago on March13, 1963. According to Klein’s records, a rifle bearing serial number C2766 wasshipped to one A. Hidell, Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Texas, on March 20,1963.Why publish a duplicate ad? Why not publish the original ad? The order formreportedly came from the February 1963 issue of American Rifleman magazine. Yetthe ad from that issue advertises a “36-inch overall” rifle. Perhaps that is whythe Commission chose to present a “duplicate” ad, which depicts aforty-inch-long rifle—the same length as the weapon identified as Oswald’s.Perhaps the discrepancy between rifle lengths had a logical explanation. But themanner in which the Commission tried to conceal this problem only furtherdemonstrates manipulation of the evidence.This problem is heightened by the fact that no record exists to show that eitherOswald or A. Hidell actually took possession of the rifle. Despite postalregulations requiring that Form 1039, which lists those persons with access to apost office box, be kept a minimum of two years after a box is closed—theCommission was told Oswald’s form had been thrown away. Likewise, there are noofficial records to show that Oswald signed for the .38 caliber pistol thatreportedly was shipped to him by Railway Express.In fact, according to Warren Commission documents, Oswald told Captain WillFritz “he had bought [the pistol] several months before in Fort Worth, Texas.”It should also be noted that Kennedy’s death certificate, the Warren Commission,the House Select Committee on Assassinations and the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association article all claimed Kennedy was killed by bullets from a“high-powered” or “high-velocity” rifle. Yet, the Warren Commission stated the6.5 mm Carcano only reached a velocity of less than 1,779 feet per second whilea high-velocity rifle exceeds 2,000 feet per second. Based on this discrepancy,the Oswald rifle could not be the death weapon.But the strongest evidence that the Carcano was not the assassination weaponcame from Ronald Simmons, chief of the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of theBallistics Research Laboratory of the Department of the Army, who headed theteam evaluating the rifle. During testimony to the Warren Commission, Simmonswas asked if his team had experienced any difficulties sighting in the rifle. Hereplied, “Well, they could not sight the weapon in using the telescope, and noattempt was made to sight it in using the iron sight. We did adjust thetelescopic sight by the addition of two shims, one which tended to adjust theazimuth and one which adjusted an elevation.”Moments later, the Warren Commission attorney stated, “For the record, Mr.Chairman, these shims were given to me by the FBI who told me that they removedthem from the weapon after they had been placed there by Mr. Simmons’slaboratory.” There were, in fact, three metal shims, which the Warren Commissiondutifully depicted in Commission Exhibits 567, 577, and 578.What an astounding admission—the Oswald rifle needed three metal shims placedunder the telescopic sight before the Army laboratory could test its accuracy.And this evidence was known to both the FBI and the Warren Commission, but neveradequately relayed to the media or the public.The experts also indicated that the telescopic sight was adjusted for aleft-handed shooter, yet both Oswald’s wife and his brother told the CommissionOswald was right-handed. Robert Oswald said, “I would say without qualification. . . he [Lee] was instinctively a right-handed person.”Added to the inferior quality and the inaccuracy of the rifle, recall Oswald’swell-documented inability to achieve marksmanship standards while in theMarines.The Warren Commission stated authoritatively, “The number C2766 is the serialnumber. This rifle is the only one of its type bearing that serial number.” Yetan FBI report dated April 30, 1964, and signed by J. Edgar Hoover stated:The Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was manufactured in Italy from 1891 until 1941;however, in the 1930’s Mussolini ordered all arms factories to manufacture theMannlicher-Carcano rifle. Since many concerns were manufacturing the sameweapon, the same serial number appears on weapons manufactured by more than oneconcern. Some bear a letter prefix and some do not.Plainly, there could be more Carcanos around with the serial number C2766—a factthat further weakens the case against Oswald.Without going into minute details, it should be noted that the sling on Oswald’srifle was not a standard rifle sling but instead seemed to come from a musicalinstrument or a camera carrying strap. No attempt was made to determine wherethis sling came from, although Commission experts, after explaining that thepurpose of such a strap is to steady the aim, stated, “The sling on the riflewas too short to use in the normal way.”Despite two massive federal investigations, not one bit of evidence has beenbrought forward as to where or when Oswald might have purchased ammunition orthe ammunition clip for the rifle. Bear in mind that no gun oil or othercleaning materials, including ammunition, were found in Oswald’s belongings.Another important piece of evidence involved a paraffin test made on Oswald theday of the assassination. The results of this test presented evidence that hemay not have fired a rifle that day, yet these results were downplayed and evensuppressed by the federal authorities.In this test, layers of paraffin are applied to a suspect’s skin and the sticky,warm wax opens the pores and then picks up any foreign material that may bepresent on the skin. When the wax cools, it forms a hard cast that is treatedwith chemicals that turn blue if nitrates are present. The idea is that the skinof someone who has recently fired a weapon will bear traces of nitrates. Whilethe presence of nitrates is not conclusive evidence that a gun wasfired—tobacco, urine, cosmetics, matches, soil, and certain drugs can cause apositive reaction—the absence of nitrates is compelling evidence that the personhas not fired a weapon.Oswald’s hands both reacted positively to the paraffin test, indicating thepresence of nitrates but no gunpowder. A cast of his right cheek showed noreaction for either. Any competent defense attorney would have pointed to thistest as evidence that his client had not fired a rifle.However, in its report the Warren Commission termed this routine police test“completely unreliable,” adding that an FBI agent fired three rounds through theOswald rifle in rapid succession and tested negative on both his hands and faceafterward.The odd part of this issue is that in publishing the Dallas police evidencesheet, the Commission deleted reference to the paraffin test at the bottom ofthe page. Why obscure this test result, which appeared to present evidence ofOswald’s innocence, if the test can be demonstrated to be faulty or unreliable?In all criminal cases, police always hope for that most important piece ofevidence linking the crime to the suspect—a fingerprint.An Incriminating Palm Print [Contents.html#rsec81]The sole piece of hard evidence linking Oswald to the Carcano rifle was a palmprint reportedly found on the underside of the gun’s barrel when disassembled.It seems strong evidence until inspected closely. To begin with, the palm printwould never have been admitted as evidence in any courtroom trial because itlacked a chain of evidence—the unquestioned and documented path from discoveryto presentation in court.According to Dallas police lieutenant John Carl Day, he discovered the palmprint shortly before turning the rifle over to the FBI about midnight onNovember 22, 1963. Yet, he mentioned it to no one and there is no record of hisdiscovery. Day even admitted to the Warren Commission that “it was his customarypractice to photograph fingerprints in most instances prior to lifting them.”Yet this was not done.About midnight, the rifle was given to FBI agent Vincent Drain, who flew withthe gun to Washington in an Air Force plane.Early on November 23, 1963, the rifle was turned over to the FBI laboratory andexamined for fingerprints. A report made that day and signed by J. Edgar Hooverreported, “No latent prints of value were developed on Oswald’s revolver, thecartridges cases, the unfired cartridge, the clip in the rifle or the innerparts of the rifle.”The FBI had no indication of any useful print. Before the Warren Commission, FBIexpert Sebastian Latona stated, “We had no personal knowledge of any palm printhaving been developed on the rifle. . . . Evidently the lifting had been socomplete that there was nothing left to show any marking on the gun itself as tothe existence of such—even an attempt on the part of anyone to process therifle.”On the morning of November 24, Oswald was killed in the basement of the Dallaspolice station and that afternoon the rifle was flown back to Dallas.On Monday, following a competent autopsy, Oswald’s body was lying in MillerFuneral Home in Fort Worth when, according to the Fort Worth Press, “An FBIteam, with a camera and a crime lab kit, spent a long time in the morgue.”Miller Funeral Home director Paul Groody told this author that the FBIfingerprinted Oswald’s corpse. Groody complained, “I had a heck of time gettingthe black fingerprint ink off of [Oswald’s] hands in time for burial.”In 1978, FBI agent Harrison confirmed to researcher Gary Mack that he, alongwith Agent Drain, had personally driven the “Oswald” rifle to the Miller FuneralHome. Harrison said at the time he understood Drain intended to place Oswald’spalm print on the rifle “for comparison purposes.”Oswald had been fingerprinted three times while in Dallas police custody. Therehas been no explanation for this postmortem fingerprinting.Later that Monday, while talking to reporters, District Attorney Wade casuallymentioned, “Let’s see . . . his fingerprints were found on the gun. Have I saidthat?” It was the first mention of any prints being found. By Monday evening,the news was all over the media. The Dallas Times Herald proclaimed: OSWALD’SPRINTS REVEALED ON RIFLE KILLING KENNEDY.Asked about the strongest evidence of Oswald’s guilt, Wade responded, “If I hadto single out any one thing, it would be the fingerprints found on the rifle andthe book cartons which [Oswald] used to prop the weapon on.” On November 26, therifle was again sent to Washington. But the incriminating palm print did notarrive at the FBI lab until November 29, three days after all other Dallaspolice evidence had been officially turned over to the bureau.By this time, FBI officials were able to confirm that the palm print matchedthat of Lee Harvey Oswald.Day continued to maintain he found the print and failed to mention it,photograph it, or send it to the FBI quickly because he believed that“sufficient traces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel.” Day toldauthor Henry Hurt that he specifically pointed out the print to Agent Drain whenhe gave him the rifle. However, Drain denied this. According to Hurt, Drain toldhim, “I just don’t believe there ever was a print. . . . All I can figure isthat it was some sort of cushion, because they were getting a lot of heat bySunday night. You could take the print off Oswald’s [arrest] card and put it onthe rifle. Something like that happened.”Considering the movements of the rifle, some researchers believe Oswald’s deadhand was placed directly on the rifle barrel. Others believe Oswald’s palm printwas taken either from jail records or the Depository and superimposed over marksfrom the rifle barrel.No serious researcher today believes that Oswald’s palm print was legitimatelylifted from the rifle barrel on November 22, 1963. Even the Warren Commissionfound this piece of evidence hard to swallow. An internal FBI memorandum madepublic only in 1978 disclosed that on August 28, 1964:[Warren Commission general counsel J. Lee] Rankin advised because of thecircumstances that now exist there was a serious question in the minds of thecommission as to whether or not the palm impression that has been obtained fromthe Dallas Police Department is a legitimate latent palm impression removed fromthe rifle barrel or whether it was obtained from some other source and that forthis reason this matter needs to be resolved.Commission fingerprint experts admitted, “It was not possible to estimate thetime which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and the date ofthe lift.” The FBI then attempted to have Lieutenant Day certify a statementconcerning his lifting of the palm print, but Day declined to sign it. One FBIfingerprint expert declined to answer researchers who merely asked if he coulddetermine whether a fingerprint came from living or dead flesh.The Commission apparently made no effort to resolve the matter. It insteadpresented the belated palm print as strong evidence of Oswald’s guilt. Like somuch of the “hard” evidence in this case, the closer one looks, the softer itbecomes.[images/line.jpg]After considering the rifle, the empty shells, and the palm print, one mustagain consider the “hero of the Warren Commission”—Commission Exhibit 399, the“magic bullet.”The discovery of Commission Exhibit 399 has been dealt with earlier. Nowconsider the highly technical studies of this bullet and other bullet fragmentsinvolved in the assassination.The Commission attempted to duplicate the feat of Commission Exhibit 399—passingthrough seven layers of skin and muscle, striking bones in two male adults, andemerging in near-perfect condition—but with no success. Similar ammunition firedinto goat carcasses, human bodies, and gelatin blocks all showed more deformitythan Commission Exhibit 399.In an attempt to explain away the unscathed condition of this bullet, members ofthe forensic pathology panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinationsargued that other bullets had done similar damage and remained in pristinecondition.However, one member of the panel, Dr. Cyril Wecht, challenged the group toproduce even one single bullet that had broken two human bones and remainedunchanged. The forensics panel declined. Dr. Wecht concluded, “It is clear to methat their reluctance was based upon their knowledge that such studies wouldfurther destroy the single-bullet theory.”Since neither the Warren Commission nor the House Select Committee onAssassinations was able to convincingly prove the feat ascribed to CommissionExhibit 399, the emission spectrography tests assume more importance. Thesespectrographic tests are a scientific means of determining whether the variousbits of bullet metal taken from both Kennedy and Connally came from the samebullet. These tests could have provided what is missing from all Kennedyassassination investigations—clear, irrefutable proof that metal found in thevictims could be traced to Commission Exhibit 399. The tests failed to do thisand the handling of this evidence raised a great deal of suspicion towardfederal authorities.Under such testing it is a simple matter to determine whether two bits of metalhave the same percentage of basic elements, such as lead, copper, and antimony.It is much more difficult to prove that such bits are from the same source.Concerning the tests, the Warren Commission chose not to ask one single questionof the spectrographic expert who conducted the tests. They were content tosimply report that several bullet fragments were “similar in metalliccomposition,” which proved nothing.In the years following the assassination, researcher Harold Weisberg soughtunsuccessfully to obtain the spectrographic test results from the US government.Government attorneys argued that revealing the results was not in the “nationalinterest,” although they would not explain why.Then in 1973, a batch of Warren Commission documents were released to the publicthat contained letters from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. In these, Hooverreported that composition of the fragments was “similar” and “that nosignificant differences were found.”The fact that differences—no matter how “significant”—were found means they arenot from the same source.The real significance in this matter is that the results of these spectrographictests have been kept from the public all these years. Obviously, if the testsproved conclusively that the fragments and Commission Exhibit 399 all came fromthe same ammunition, the case against Oswald would have been strengthenedconsiderably. In fact, the opposite occurred. And by concealing the testresults, the Commission raised further suspicion about government handling ofthe case.Unreported in the Commission’s report or volumes was an account of even furtherscientific testing, this time using neutron activation analysis, a sophisticatedmethod of determining differences in composition by bombarding the test objectwith radiation.In referring to this test in a letter made public in 1973, Hoover wrote, “Whileminor variations in composition were found by this method, these were notconsidered to be sufficient to permit positively differentiating among thelarger bullet fragments and thus positively determining from which of the largerbullet fragments any given small fragment may have come.”This wording is suspiciously deceptive, since any difference in composition isevidence that the fragments are not from the same ammunition.Faced with scientific evidence that Kennedy and Connally were not struck by thesame bullet, the House Select Committee on Assassinations decided to conduct itsown tests. But researchers’ hopes for a final, clear determination on thismatter dimmed with the committee’s selection of Dr. Vincent P. Guinn to conductthe tests. Guinn admitted he had been an informal consultant to the FBI evenprior to the Kennedy assassination. And predictably, Guinn concluded that it was“highly probable” that fragments taken from Connally’s wrist came fromCommission Exhibit 399.This seemed to be the strong, clear evidence researchers had been looking for,even though it appeared to support the single-bullet theory. Guinn’s conclusionswere warmly embraced by the House committee. But it was later learned that thewrist fragments originally tested in 1964 were missing. And Guinn admittedpublicly that the fragments he tested were not the originals from the NationalArchives.Author Henry Hurt quoted Guinn as admitting that fragments from CommissionExhibit 399 could have been substituted for the missing fragments: “Possiblythey would take a bullet, take out a few little pieces and put it in acontainer, and say, ‘This is what came out of Connally’s wrist.’ And naturallyif you compare it with CE 399, it will look alike. . . . I have no control overthese things.”Guinn also reported that he had examples of the ammunition from the fourproduction runs in 1954 made at Western Cartridge Company, manufacturers of theMannlicher-Carcano bullets. “Reportedly those are the only lots they everproduced, and we have boxes from each of those lots,” Guinn told the committee.If this was indeed the only ammunition ever produced, the results of Guinn’stests gain credibility. However, a Warren Commission document dealing with aninterview of a Western Cartridge representative revealed this comment:The Western Cartridge Company . . . manufactured a quantity of 6.5 . . .Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition for the Italian government during World War II. Atthe end of the war the Italian Carcano rifle, and no telling how much of thistype of ammunition, was sold to United States gun brokers and dealers andsubsequently was distributed by direct sales to wholesalers, retailers andindividual purchasers.If the ammunition supposedly used in the Oswald rifle came from this World WarII batch, then Dr. Guinn tested the wrong bullets. This is another example ofhow seemingly indisputable evidence in the assassination diminishes upon closerexamination.Without arguing the technical aspects of Dr. Guinn’s analysis, it should bepointed out that he failed to recall or report on his prior governmentalconnections with the JFK case. House Select Committee on Assassinationssubcommittee member Floyd J. Fithian asked:Dr. Guinn, this is not meant to be an embarrassing question, but I think I mustask it. Mr. Chairman, a recent article in the New York Times magazine statedthat you had worked for the Warren Commission and therefore, your conclusionsfor this committee would be implicitly biased. Did you ever work for the WarrenCommission or work for the FBI in connection with the analysis of these evidencesamples?Dr. Guinn responded:Neither one. I think Mr. Wolf called my attention to the existence of thisarticle, which I haven’t seen, and I don’t know where they got theirmisinformation, but I never did anything for the Warren Commission, and althoughI know people in the FBI, I have never done any work for them.In reality, it seems Dr. Guinn had a long record of working to prove Oswald’sguilt. On August 28, 1964, the New York Times reported:The use of radioactivity in criminology may determine whether Lee Harvey Oswaldkilled President Kennedy, a San Diego, Calif., chemist said today. Dr. VincentP. Guinn, head of the activation analysis program of the General Atomic divisionof General Dynamics Corporation, has been working on the problem with theFederal Bureau of Investigation. Dr. Guinn said he was working even then withradioactive analysis but could not make public his findings until released bythe Warren Commission.Sherry Fiester, a retired certified senior crime scene analyst with more thantwenty-five years’ experience, studied Guinn’s work and characterized it as“grossly flawed.” She noted, “Scientific testing in 2006 and 2007 indicate theavailable evidence is consistent with between two and five bullets being firedin Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. This number of bullets wouldbe consistent with more than one shooter and indicates the single-gunman theorycan’t be supported by science.”Another major piece of evidence against Oswald was a brown paper bag reportedlydiscovered in the Texas School Book Depository on the afternoon of theassassination—although it is not depicted in any of the crime scene photographs.The Warren Commission claimed Oswald used the bag to transport the Carcano riflefrom a home in Irving, Texas, to the Depository on the morning of November 22,1963.If this bag indeed belonged to Oswald and if it could be traced to theDepository, it becomes strong evidence of Oswald’s guilt. But again, upon closerinspection, this piece of evidence becomes highly questionable. First, while theOswald rifle was found to be well oiled, there is absolutely no trace of gun oilon the paper bag. Second, federal authorities claimed to have found cloth fiberson the bag that matched those of a blanket used to wrap the rifle at the Irvinghome. However, a Dallas police photograph of assassination evidence shows thebag touching the blanket, which thus could have produced the incriminating fiberevidence. To add credence to this idea, the FBI found no traces of paper bagparticles on the rifle.When the Dallas evidence was shipped to the FBI laboratory early on November 23,there was no mention of the paper bag. Instead, Dallas FBI agent in charge J.Gordon Shanklin mentioned the blanket, which he suggested was used to carry therifle into the Depository.Both Wesley Frazier and his sister, Linnie Mae Randle, testified that Oswaldtook a paper bag to work with him on the morning of the assassination. However,both said they did not believe the bag they saw was like the one the WarrenCommission showed them. Frazier said Oswald told him the bag contained curtainrods for his room in Dallas. Frazier also said Oswald carried the package intothe Depository tucked under his arm, with one end cupped in his hand and theother under his armpit.Since the disassembled rifle measured thirty-five inches long, it would havebeen impossible for someone of Oswald’s height to carry it in this position.Jack Dougherty, a Depository employee who saw Oswald arrive for work, said hehad seen no bag.Yet the paper bag was a necessary piece of evidence, for if Oswald did not carrythe rifle into the Depository on November 22, then it must have gotten there insome other manner. This possibility opened too many areas of investigation. Butif Oswald fashioned the bag from wrapping paper at the Depository—as the WarrenCommission concluded—how did he get it to the Irving home, where he spent thenight before the assassination?Frazier, who drove Oswald to Irving, repeatedly said Oswald had no package withhim at that time. The Commission decided Oswald must have hidden the paper bagin his jacket, although there was no reason to do so and despite the discomfortand rustling noise sure to have been made by a forty-two-inch-by-eighteen-inchfolded paper bag.This whole issue is further clouded by a duplicate FBI report that claims twoopposite facts concerning the paper bag. In a November 29, 1963, report numberedDallas 89-43 released with other FBI documents in 1968, agent Vincent Drainwrote, “This paper was examined by the FBI laboratory and found to have the sameobservable characteristics as the brown paper bag shaped like a gun case whichwas found near the scene of the shooting on the sixth floor of the Texas SchoolBook Depository building.”In 1980, researcher Gary Shaw discovered what appeared to be this same FBIreport in the National Archives. It bore the same dates and the sameidentification number—Dallas 89-43.However, in this version of Drain’s report, it stated, “This paper was examinedby the FBI laboratory and found not to be identical with the paper gun casefound at the scene of the shooting.”When pressed to explain the two opposite versions of the same report, WilliamBaker, then the FBI’s assistant director of the Office of Congressional andPublic Affairs, told researcher Edgar F. Tatro the version that statesDepository paper and the paper bag are not the same was “inaccurate.” Baker saidthe inaccuracy in Drain’s original report was caught at FBI headquarters and theDallas office was instructed to “make corrections at that time.” He added thatthe “inaccurate” report was mistakenly passed along to the Warren Commission.Baker concluded, “We hope the above explanation resolves the problem.”Far from resolving the problem of identical FBI reports that state oppositefacts, this incident raises the question of how many other assassinationdocuments stated one thing and were subsequently “revised.” And if there doexist “revised” documents in federal files, how would anyone know unless theoriginals accidentally slip out, as appeared to have happened in this case?Considering all of the above and considering that not one of the lawmen whosearched the Depository mentioned finding the bag in their testimony, theevidence of the paper bag must be viewed skeptically. Recall the two days thatall assassination evidence was in the hands of the FBI unbeknownst to the mediaand public.Two other observations should be made concerning primary pieces of evidence—thepresidential limousine and the rifle.Even while the limousine was parked at the emergency-room door of ParklandHospital, federal agents and even Dallas police apparently mopped up blood,picked up bullet fragments, and otherwise tampered with this important evidence,contrary to basic crime scene protection procedures in place even at that time.White House photographer Cecil Stroughton noticed agents at the limousine. Thetrunk was open and the plastic top was being placed on the car. He recalled aman washing the seat “with a cloth and he had a bucket.”Within forty-eight hours the limousine was shipped to the manufacturer Hess &Eisenhardt and completely dismantled, thus destroying any important bloodstains,bullet holes, or more bullet fragments that could have shed light on theassassination. Although government agents examined the car the day after theassassination, there is no evidence that members of the Warren Commissionclosely studied this important piece of evidence, including photographs of acontroversial bullet or fragment strike on the windshield.And although the Carcano was checked for fingerprints, apparently it was nevergiven the simple test by Dallas police or federal authorities to determinewhether it had been recently fired. This normal testing might have provedconclusively whether the rifle had been used in the assassination. Researchersview the failure to conduct such a test as strong evidence of fabrication in thecase against Oswald.Other vital evidence was destroyed. After receiving Governor Connally’sbloodstained clothing at Parkland Hospital, congressman Henry Gonzalez kept thispotential evidence in a closet in his Washington office. Several months later,while Gonzalez was home in Texas, Clifton Carter, an aide to Lyndon Johnson,notified a Gonzalez secretary that the Secret Service was coming to pick upConnally’s clothing.Sometime later, this clothing was presented as evidence to the WarrenCommission. But by this time, it had been cleaned and pressed, therebyeliminating metal traces at the bullet holes that could have been studied todetermine the type of ammunition and the direction of shots.It is interesting that it was Gonzalez who formally called for a reopening ofthe assassination investigation in 1975, which led to the forming of the HouseSelect Committee on Assassinations.But the one piece of evidence that did more than all others to convict Oswald asthe assassin in the minds of the American public was the famous backyardphotographs depicting Oswald with a rifle and a communist publication.Questionable Backyard Photos [Contents.html#rsec82]Dallas police claimed to have discovered two prints and one negative of picturesshowing Lee Harvey Oswald standing in his backyard wearing a holstered pistoland holding a rifle and some communist literature. According to police reports,these photos were found among Oswald’s possessions in the garage of the Painehome in Irving, Texas, on Saturday, November 23, 1963, although a search the daybefore failed to turn up such photos.One of these photos became the cover of the February 21, 1964, issue of Lifemagazine. This now-famous issue, published seven months before the WarrenCommission issued its verdict, convicted the suspect by proclaiming, “Lee Oswaldwith the weapons he used to kill President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.”The Warren Commission heard from Oswald’s accommodating wife, Marina, that shehad taken the snapshots with a handheld Imperial Reflex camera at her husband’sinsistence. Based on Marina’s testimony and the order form for Oswald’s rifle,the Commission pinpointed the date as March 31, 1963. She said she took oneshot, then handed the camera back to Oswald, who advanced the film and handed itback for her to take another picture.The Commission asserted that the rifle in the picture is the same rifle found onthe sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.Yet when shown the photographs by Dallas police, captain Will Fritz said Oswaldmade the following comments:He said the picture was not his, that the face was his face, but that thispicture had been made by someone superimposing his face, the other part of thepicture was not him at all and that he had never seen the picture before. . . .He told me that he understood photography real well, and that in time, he wouldbe able to show that it was not his picture, and that it had been made bysomeone else.Of course, Oswald never got the opportunity to explain the backyard photos. Butvarious researchers have spent years studying this incriminating evidence, andtoday most are convinced Oswald was truthful about the pictures’ beingfabricated.To begin with, it appears there were actually four backyard pictures. One wasdescribed by Marguerite Oswald as depicting her son holding a rifle above hishead with both hands. She was shown this photo by Marina at the Paines’ Irvinghome the night of the assassination. On Marguerite’s insistence, theincriminating photo was burned and flushed down a toilet.In 1976 the Senate Intelligence Committee discovered yet a fourth backyard photoin the hands of the widow of a Dallas policeman. Mrs. Roscoe White said herhusband, who worked in the Dallas photographic lab, once told her the picturewould be very valuable someday. In this heretofore unknown version of thebackyard photo, Oswald is depicted holding the rifle in his left hand and thecommunist material in his right. This is the same pose Dallas police used inreenacting the photo for the Warren Commission—strong evidence that authoritieswere aware of the suppressed picture long before it became known to the public.Photo experts told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that the mostfamous backyard picture—the one used on the cover of Life magazine—was obviouslymade from the original negative while in the hands of Dallas authorities. Yetthis negative was never accounted for by the Dallas police. The committee noted,“There is no official record explaining why the Dallas Police Department failedto give the Warren Commission the other original negative.”To further cloud this issue, two Dallas commercial photographic processors havetold this author they saw copies of the backyard photo the night of theassassination—more than twelve hours before they were reported found in thePaine garage.Robert Hester, who was called from home on November 22, 1963, to help processassassination-related photographs for the FBI and Dallas police at NationalPhoto, said he saw an FBI agent with a color transparency of one of thesepictures and that one of the backyard photos he processed showed no figure inthe picture. Hester’s claim was corroborated by his wife, Patricia, who alsohelped process film on the day of the assassination.There is also considerable question regarding the camera reportedly used to makethese photographs. Oswald’s brother Robert claimed to have obtained the camerafrom the Paine home on December 8, 1963. He said he did not mention it toauthorities because he didn’t realize anyone would be interested.Robert was only told the camera belonged to his brother by Ruth Paine and theFBI did not receive the camera until February 24, 1964. About that time, Marinawas shown two cameras but failed to identify either as belonging to her husband.When the government got the camera, it was inoperable. FBI photographic expertLyndal L. Shaneyfelt told the Warren Commission, “In order to be able to make aphotograph with the camera, I had to make slight repairs to the shutter lever,which had been bent. I straightened it and cleaned the lens in order to removethe dirt which had accumulated.”Finally, in June 1964, Marina identified the camera as the one she used to takethe photographs. Marina, who originally claimed to have taken only one picture,revised this statement in her testimony to the commission in February 1964. Shesaid, “I had even forgotten that I had taken two photographs. I thought therewas only one. I thought there were two identical pictures, but they turned outto be two different poses.”She, of course, never mentioned the other two photographs. But then thisincident was not the only time Marina’s testimony reflected inconsistencies andrehearsal.An objective viewing of the three available backyard photographs revealsinternal problems aplenty. Although all three pictures were reportedly takenwith a handheld camera, the background of all three is identical when brought tothe same size. That is, though cropped differently in the three photos, theelements of the background—shadows, leaves, branches, stairs, etc.—are exactlyidentical. This sameness of background could possibly be produced with astationary camera on a heavy tripod but is impossible with a handheld camera.The V-shaped shadow under Oswald’s nose remains the same in all three pictures,although his head is tilted in different directions.And the photos all show a discernible line marking a break in the print’semulsion across Oswald’s face just above a flat, broad chin. In Dallas policephotos, it is clear that Oswald had a sharply pointed, cleft chin.And when all three photos are brought to the same size and placed on top of eachother as transparencies, nothing matches except the face of Lee Harvey OswaldOswald’s assessment that the photos are superimposed fakes has been confirmed bytwo foreign authorities. In 1977, Major John Pickard, commander of thephotographic department at the Canadian Defense Department, made thesestatements after studying the backyard pictures:The pictures have the earmarks of being faked. The shadows fall in conflictingdirections. The shadow of Oswald’s nose falls in one direction and that of hisbody in another. The photos were shot from a slightly different angle, adifferent distance, with the gun in a different hand. So, if one photo is laidon top of another, nothing could match exactly. Yet, impossibly, while one bodyis bigger, in the other the heads match perfectly, bearing out Oswald’s chargethat his head was pasted on an incriminating photograph.Author and British Broadcasting Corporation investigative reporter AnthonySummers had the photos studied by retired detective superintendent MalcolmThompson, a past president of the Institute of Incorporated Photographers inEngland. Thompson said he detected retouching in the photos around the area ofOswald’s head and on the butt of the rifle. He also noted inconsistencies in thelocation of shadows and the different chin on Oswald. Thompson stated, “One canonly conclude that Oswald’s head has been stuck on to a chin which is notOswald’s chin. . . . My opinion is that those photographs are faked. . . . Iconsider the pictures to be the result of a montage.”However, neither Pickard nor Thompson studied the original photos. ThePhotographic Evidence Panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations,which did study the originals, concluded in 1978 that it could find no evidenceof fakery in the backyard photos.This conclusion rested primarily on studies that showed markings on the edges ofthe negative of one of the original photographs were identical to markings onother photographs made by the Imperial Reflex camera. This ballistics-typeevidence convinced the panel that the photos must be genuine.However, Texas graphics expert Jack White pointed out that if a knowledgeableperson wanted to fake the backyard pictures, it would have been a simple matterto produce a high-quality montage photograph using one backyard scene, a figurewith rifle and papers, and a head shot of Oswald, which then could bephotocopied using the Imperial Reflex camera. This procedure would produce afaked backyard photo that could be proven to have come from the camera traced toOswald. Another method to achieve the same results, according to White, would beto make an exposure through the Imperial Reflex camera that would include themarkings on the edge but nothing else. Then, when the composite photo iscombined with this, the markings become part of the negative.Asked to study the sameness of the different photos’ backgrounds, the Housecommittee’s experts said they measured the distances between certain objects inthe pictures—such as wooden fence posts—and determined some differences indistance, indicating that the photos were indeed separate shots.White, who died in 2012, argued that these differences were simply the result of“keystoning” or tilting the easel on which the photograph was exposed in anenlarger. He said he, too, had been concerned with what appeared to bedifferences in the photos but discovered that by simply tilting the photographicprint in an enlarger’s easel, the backgrounds of the supposedly separatepictures overlapped and matched perfectly.Furthermore, in recent years White discovered other problems with the backyardphotos. In one picture, the tips of Oswald’s fingers appear to be missing asdoes one end of the rifle’s telescopic sight. White claimed this was due tosloppy airbrushing on the part of whoever faked the picture. In one photo, thefigure can be seen to be wearing a large ring on his right hand, yet the ring ismissing in the other photos.Sameness of backgrounds and Oswald’s face, conflicting shadows and distances,loss of portions of the photos—again, a vital piece of evidence remains in“controversy” despite the studied opinions of experts and inconsistencies thatcan be viewed by any layperson.Yet the federal government continues to vouch for the authenticity of theincriminating photos. The reason for this steadfast support may have been voicedby House committee chief counsel Robert Blakey, who stated, “If [the backyardphotographs] are invalid, how they were produced poses far-reaching questions inthe area of conspiracy, for they evince a degree of technical sophisticationthat would almost necessarily raise the possibility that [someone] conspired notonly to kill the President, but to make Oswald a patsy.”Reenactment Problems [Contents.html#rsec83]In light of the controversies surrounding the physical evidence attempting tolink Lee Harvey Oswald to the assassination, the Warren Commission tried tostrengthen the case against the ex-Marine through the use of reenactments.However, at least two of the participants have questioned the results of thesereenactments.Chester Breneman, a surveyor who participated in two separate reenactments ofthe Kennedy assassination, said the studies proved that more than one man wasinvolved in the shooting. Breneman, who went on to become county surveyor ofEastland County, Texas, told this author in 1978 that distance and time figuresthe Warren Commission published were “at odds” with figures obtained in thereenactment staged for the FBI and Secret Service in 1964.Height and distance figures altered by the federal government mean that allsubsequent computer analyses based on such figures are erroneous and baseless.Breneman’s story was confirmed by Dallas County surveyor Robert West, who alsoparticipated in both reenactments. Both men were in West’s office on the Mondayfollowing the assassination when a man entered. Breneman recalled:[He] said he was a special investigator for Life magazine. He asked if we wouldmake an investigation down there [in Dealey Plaza] and see if any other bulletswere fired and from which direction they came. They were aware at that time thatsomething was haywire. . . . So, we went down there and roped the area off. Istood on the parapet where [Abraham] Zapruder stood and took those pictures.They had still pictures of all the frames of Zapruder’s film. [Author’semphasis—Reportedly Life did not take possession of the Zapruder film until thatsame day and evidence indicates the film was actually processed and manipulatedby the CIA in New York state.]Breneman and West took measurements of the plaza and distances from the TexasSchool Book Depository and matched everything against the Zapruder stills.Later that day, Breneman accompanied Life’s investigators to the thirteenthfloor of Dallas’s Adolphus Hotel, where they were headquartered. He said at thattime everybody involved agreed that no one man could have done all the shooting.Breneman said the magazine investigators also had obtained a Carcano rifle andattempted to work the bolt in the time frame attributed to Oswald. Breneman, aformer Marine medal winner for marksmanship, said he, too, worked the rifle’sbolt for hours. He said, “We came to the conclusion that it couldn’t be done inthe time limit they were trying to get me down to.”He also recounted a strange incident that occurred during his time with themagazine people. “This [one] man told me, ‘My life isn’t worth a plug nickel onthis investigation.’ Then he pulled his shirt back and showed me thisbulletproof vest. I thought that was a little odd.”Breneman again was visiting his friend West on May 31, 1964, when the FBI andSecret Service reenacted the assassination for the Warren Commission. Bothsurveyors participated in the tests. Breneman recalled:We again measured distances and elevations by matching the frames of theZapruder film. We examined a bullet mark on the curb on the south side of [Elm]street. This part of the curb was replaced shortly after the assassination.Also, right after the assassination, they were mentioning a [highway] sign whichhad a stress mark from a bullet on it. It’s my understanding that thisparticular sign was quickly taken down and no one has been able to locate it.During the May reenactment, Breneman said the FBI used a big Cadillac as asubstitute for Kennedy’s Lincoln Continental. “It was in no way like Kennedy’slimousine,” said Breneman.West added, “That was one thing that was always funny to me. They brought thisbig old Cadillac down to use in the tests, but it was thirteen inches higherthan Kennedy’s car.” Breneman agreed, “They were all crunched up in there,shoulder to shoulder. In that condition it could have been possible for one manto shoot two of them.”West said his study showed that one of the alleged shots from the Depositoryfollowed a path straight through a leafy tree. “If he shot through a hole inthat tree, it was absolutely fantastic,” commented West. Breneman concluded, “Iwish to state that both investigations led us to believe beyond any doubt thatthere were two assassins. Life magazine’s special investigators believed this tobe true. The Secret Service would not say. But at the time, that seemed to bethe reason we were there and we felt the Secret Service felt that way too.”After the Warren Commission published the figures from the governmentreenactment, Breneman and West were shocked to find that the figures did notmatch those they made at the time. Both Breneman and West retained copies of theDealey Plaza reenactment figures.Breneman said:They [the figures] were at odds with our figures. After checking a few figures,I said, “That’s enough for me,” and I stopped reading. . . . For instance, onour map, we marked the spot corresponding to Zapruder film frame 171. The WarrenCommission changed this to 166 before they used it in the report. The WarrenReport shows a 210 where we show a 208. . . . It would seem to me that . . .these figures were changed just enough that the Warren Commission could come upwith the idea that another shot came from the same direction as the first. Butall I have been concerned with is, did another shot come from another direction?I know danged well it did.Neither Breneman nor West—the actual surveyors used for the government’sreenactment studies—was asked to testify to the Warren Commission. Further, theCommission declined to publish the map Breneman and West drew, claiming it wasinaccurate.This map indicates a bullet hit on the south curb of Elm Street. Breneman said,“We were told not to study those bullet marks by the FBI.”Again, any meaningful search for the truth of the assassination was ended byaltered figures and orders not to note extraneous bullet marks—all from federalauthorities."},{"pageContent":"The Warren Commission [Contents.html#rch15]The federal government, led by president Lyndon Johnson, began to assert itselfimmediately following Kennedy’s death. Against normal procedure of that time,all evidence was removed from Dallas that night and sent to FBI headquarters inWashington.The day after the assassination, despite tremendous confusion in Dallas andelsewhere, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover forwarded to Johnson a preliminaryreport supporting the idea of Lee Harvey Oswald’s sole guilt. At this time, onlyselected FBI officials had seen all the evidence and the plausible suspicion offabrication and substitution grew.Following the death of the accused assassin on November 24, calls increased foran investigation independent from that of the Dallas police, who in many circleswere being held responsible for Oswald’s death.That same day, Hoover talked with Johnson aide Walter Jenkins, stating, “Thething I am concerned about, and so is [deputy attorney general Nicholas D.]Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswaldis the real assassin. Mr. Katzenbach thinks that the President might appoint aPresidential Commission of three outstanding citizens to make a determination.”On November 25, President Johnson ordered his friend Hoover to prepare adetailed report on the circumstances surrounding Kennedy’s death. The news mediawere already reporting leaks from the bureau, including, “Rumors that will bespiked by the [FBI] report . . . is one that there was a conspiracy involved,and another one that shots fired at Kennedy came from different guns.”That same day, Katzenbach wrote a memo to Johnson aide Bill Moyers and outlinedhis thoughts on an assassination investigation:It is important that all of the facts surrounding President Kennedy’sassassination be made public in a way which will satisfy people in the UnitedStates and abroad. That all the facts have been told and that a statement tothis effect be made now.1. The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did nothave confederates who are still at large; that the evidence was such that hewould have been convicted at trial.2. Speculation about Oswald’s motivation ought to be cut off, and we should havesome basis for rebutting the thought that this was a communist conspiracy or (asthe Iron Curtain press is saying) a right-wing conspiracy to blame it on thecommunists. Unfortunately the facts on Oswald seem about too pat—too obvious(Marxist, Cuba, Russian wife, etc.). The Dallas Police have put out statementson the communist conspiracy theory, and it was they who were in charge when hewas shot and thus silenced.3. The matter has been handled thus far with neither dignity nor conviction;facts are mixed with rumor and speculation. We can scarcely let the world see ustotally in the image of the Dallas Police when our President is murdered.I think this objective may be satisfied and made public as soon as possible withthe completion of a thorough FBI report on Oswald and the assassination. Thismay run into the difficulty of pointing to inconsistency between this report andstatements by Dallas Police officials; but the reputation of the Bureau is suchthat it may do the whole job.The only other step would be the appointment of a Presidential Commission ofunimpeachable personnel to review and examine the evidence and announce itsconclusions. This has both advantages and disadvantages. I think it can awaitpublication of the FBI report and public reaction to it here and abroad.Also on November 25, Texas attorney general Waggoner Carr announced he plannedto conduct a court of inquiry concerning the deaths of both Kennedy and Oswald.Carr named two prominent Texas attorneys—Leon Jaworski (who went on to becomethe special Watergate prosecutor) and Dean Storey—as special counsel for theprobe.The next day, Senator Everett Dirksen announced that a Senate investigation ofthe assassination would be conducted by a special committee headed by senatorJames O. Eastland, chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee. One Republicansenator told newsmen, “Too many people are disturbed about the strangecircumstances of the whole tragic affair.” Not to be outdone by the Senate, theHouse of Representatives announced an attempt to create yet anotherinvestigative committee the next day.The grief-stricken attorney general, Robert Kennedy, was never consulted aboutany of these attempts. But the next-ranking officials of the JusticeDepartment—Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach and solicitor general ArchibaldCox (also of Watergate fame)—met with Johnson’s close friend attorney AbeFortas, who had blocked the 1948 election investigation of Johnson by obtaininga court order from Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black.These men, aided by Yale law professor Eugene Rostow, secretary of state DeanRusk, and columnist Joseph Alsop—all members of the elitist Council on ForeignRelations—convinced President Johnson that the public could misinterpret hisplan for a Texas investigation as an attempt to cover up the crimes in Johnson’shome state. They argued a national commission headed by men of supposedlyunimpeachable integrity was needed.In explaining the formation of what came to be known as the Warren Commission,the Dallas Morning News commented, “Creation of the Presidential commissionappeared certain to head off several congressional inquiries into the slaying ofPresident Kennedy in Dallas a week ago.”The newspaper was absolutely correct. With the creation of the WarrenCommission, not only had Johnson blocked any congressional investigations but,by the next week, Texas attorney general Carr had announced postponement of hisstate board of inquiry.Despite massive media coverage of Oswald’s arrest, his slaying, and the amountof evidence offered to the public by both Dallas and federal authorities, aGallup poll taken the first week of December 1963 showed a majority ofrespondents—52 percent—continued to believe that Oswald had not acted alone.Rumors were widespread in Texas that Johnson in some way had a hand in theassassination. A man of distinction and credibility was needed to stop suchrumors. That man was chief justice Earl Warren.The Reluctant Chairman [Contents.html#rsec84]Earl Warren had no middle name. He once said, “My parents were too poor toafford the luxury of a middle name.” Born to Scandinavian immigrants on March19, 1891, Warren grew up in Los Angeles and nearby Bakersfield. By deliveringnewspapers, working for the railroad where his father was employed, andperforming other odd jobs, Warren managed to save enough money to enroll at theUniversity of California at Berkeley.After receiving a bachelor of letters degree he entered law school. Warrengraduated from the University of California Law School near the bottom of hisclass on May 14, 1914.His law practice was interrupted by World War I. After enlisting as an infantryprivate, Warren was accepted for officer training and became a lieutenant.However, the Armistice was signed before Lieutenant Warren could leave theUnited States. After the war, Warren became an assistant attorney for the Cityof Oakland and later a member of the district attorney’s staff. By the late1920s, he had married Nina Palmquist Meyers and was elected as one of thenation’s youngest district attorneys.Building a reputation for honesty, hard work, and court convictions, Warreneasily won reelection in 1930. As his family grew, so did his politicalreputation.In the late 1930s, Warren campaigned for and won the office of Californiaattorney general.Almost immediately, Republican Warren was in a heated contest with theCalifornia Democratic governor Culbert Olson. Adding to their politicaldifferences were Olson’s support of unions and his outspoken isolationism on theeve of World War II. This conflict reached a breaking point when, after PearlHarbor, Olson proclaimed a state of emergency in California. As attorneygeneral, Warren challenged his authority to do so and shortly afterward declaredhimself a candidate for governor.In a surprising upset—Roosevelt and the Democrats were still in firm controlnationally—Warren was elected governor of California in late 1942 by more than342,000 votes.In 1946, Warren handily won reelection as governor and began to look towardWashington. During the 1948 Republican National Convention, Warren reluctantlyagreed to run for vice president with Thomas Dewey, the former governor of NewYork. He may have actually been relieved when the team was defeated by Truman inthe greatest upset victory in American politics.Still hoping for a national office, Warren announced he would seek the GOPpresidential nomination in 1952. He was chagrined to quickly find himself pittedagainst the war hero Dwight “Ike” Eisenhower. Richard Nixon, who had signed apledge to support Warren, nevertheless began to campaign for Eisenhower, hopingfor the vice presidential nomination that he indeed later received. Eisenhowergot the nomination and then the presidency. Nixon, who had been in public officefor only six years, was the nation’s number-two man.Warren had been a strong contender and Nixon feared his clout in the nextelection. According to Warren biographer Jack Harrison Pollack:Nixon . . . badgered Eisenhower to find a suitable appointment for GovernorWarren which would effectively separate him from his electoral constituency. Theideal solution presented itself in September 1953, when a vacancy arose on theSupreme Court after Chief Justice Fred Vinson suddenly died. Warren, who alreadyhad decided not to seek a fourth term as governor, was offered the prized seatand, to Nixon’s delight, accepted.New on the job and with the naïve Eisenhower years as a backdrop, Warren madeinitial decisions as chief justice that tended to support the status quo. But ashe grew more comfortable in his position, his decisions began to reflect theprogressive policies he advocated as California governor. It was under Warren’sleadership that the Supreme Court—after years of foot dragging—finally ruled onthe touchy desegregation issues raised by Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka,Kansas. Using private discussions as well as judicial conferences, where thejustices took no positions, Warren was able to guide the court to its unanimousdecision in favor of Brown, which virtually eliminated the old “Jim Crow”separate-but-equal segregation laws and paved the way for racial equality in theUnited States.Brown was a landmark decision and one that caused archconservatives to begin acampaign of bitter attacks against the chief justice. IMPEACH EARL WARREN signswere commonplace throughout the South. Later court opinions dealing with therights of accused persons and the persecution of suspected communists addedfurther fuel to the fires of Warren’s opponents.In the squeaky-close election of 1960, the Republican Warren found himselfvoting for young John F. Kennedy, apparently because he could not bring himselfto vote for the ever-ambitious Nixon. Displaying considerable foresight, Warrentold a California friend, “Nixon is a bad man.”Warren and Kennedy voiced mutual respect for each other and the new presidentsupported the Warren Court’s progressive activism, even in such controversialcases as the June 1963 decision that outlawed compulsory prayer in publicschools.Six months later, Warren was asked to head a federal panel to decide who hadkilled Kennedy.On November 29, the same day President Johnson announced his plans for a specialcommission, Warren was visited by deputy attorney general Nicholas D. Katzenbachand solicitor general Archibald Cox (years later fired by Nixon as specialWatergate prosecutor). Warren was told he was being asked to serve as chairmanof the presidential commission. He declined, saying, “Please tell the Presidentthat I am sorry but I cannot properly undertake this assignment.” Warren thenexplained that he did not feel it proper for a member of one branch ofgovernment to be employed by another branch.Two hours later, Warren received a telephone call from President Johnson. Thenew president wasn’t going to take no for an answer. He summoned Warren to hisoffice. Dutifully, the chief justice reported to his president and received thefamous “Johnson treatment”—a combination of back-patting and arm-twisting.According to Warren biographer Pollack:The President spoke gravely of the desperate need to restore public confidence.He hinted darkly at the possibility of dangerous international repercussions. Heinvoked Warren’s sense of duty and patriotism. . . . By the end of theinterview, he had succeeded in making Warren feel that to refuse the Presidentwould be a betrayal of a public trust. As a man-to-man persuader, Lyndon Johnsonhad no equal. His trump card was: “Mr. Chief Justice, you were a soldier inWorld War I. There’s nothing you then did that compares with what you can do nowfor your country. As your Commander-in-Chief, I am ordering you back intoservice.”There may have been matters of more personal concern that Johnson transmitted toWarren. In an internal memorandum written on February 17, 1964, WarrenCommission attorney Melvin Eisenberg mentioned what Warren told fellowcommissioners regarding how he had been “pressured” by Johnson. Eisenberg wrote:The President stated that rumors of the most exaggerated kind were circulatingin this country and overseas. . . . Some rumors went so far as attributing theassassination to a faction within the government wishing the presidency assumedby President Johnson. Others, if not quenched, could conceivably lead thecountry into a war. . . . No one could refuse to do something which might helpprevent such a possibility. . . . He placed emphasis on the quenching of rumorsand precluding further speculation.Warren left the emotional meeting with tears in his eyes, perhaps thinking ofwhat had become of the country he loved. He had reluctantly agreed to chair thecommission. It is obvious that Warren’s sense of patriotism outweighed his senseof legality in his acceptance of the Commission chairmanship.Later that same afternoon, Johnson signed Executive Order 11130, creating theseven-man Warren Commission.[images/line.jpg]Commission members saw their work as having a dual purpose—one, to find thefacts of the Kennedy assassination, the other, to calm public fears andsuspicions both at home and abroad. Allen Dulles told author Edward Jay Epsteinthat since an atmosphere of rumors and suspicion interferes with the functioningof the government, especially abroad, one of the Commission’s main tasks was todispel rumors.Other Commission members also thought it their duty to protect the US image asreflected in these public statements:JOHN MCCLOY: [It was of paramount importance to] show the world that America isnot a banana republic, where a government can be changed by conspiracy.JOHN COOPER: [An important purpose was] to lift the cloud of doubts that hadbeen cast over American institutions.When evidence presented to the Commission supported this duality of purpose,there was no problem. But since so much evidence contradicted the officialassassination theory and called into question certain government institutions,it must be asked which purpose became paramount to the commissioners.Johnson’s old friend, lawyer Abe Fortas, and Katzenbach had prepared a list ofseven prominent persons to serve on the new presidential commission. PresidentJohnson promptly approved this list without change.Headed by Chief Justice Warren, the Commission members were:Representative Hale Boggs (D-Louisiana): The most vocal critic among Commissionmembers, Boggs became frustrated with the panel’s total reliance on the FBI forinformation. Speaking of the “single-bullet theory,” Boggs once commented, “Ihad strong doubts about it.” On April 1, 1971, House Majority Leader Boggsdelivered a blistering attack on J. Edgar Hoover, charging that under hisdirectorship the FBI had adopted “the tactics of the Soviet Union and Hitler’sGestapo.” Boggs, who undoubtedly would have become Speaker of the House and apowerful ally in any reopening of the JFK assassination investigation, vanishedon October 16, 1972, while on a military junket flight in Alaska. Despite amassive search, no trace of the airplane or of Boggs has ever been found.Senator John Sherman Cooper (R-Kentucky): A former member of the KentuckyGeneral Assembly and county judge, Cooper served with the US 3rd Army in Europeduring World War II and helped reorganize the judicial system in Bavaria. Healso was a former ambassador to India and Nepal in the mid-1950s. Like Boggs,Cooper later voiced dissatisfaction with the Commission’s “single-bullettheory,” stating he was “unconvinced.”Allen W. Dulles: Dulles had been fired as director of the Central IntelligenceAgency by Kennedy following the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion. Today it seemsmore than ironic that Dulles would have been selected to sit in judgment onKennedy’s death. Dulles also was tightly connected to the military, not onlybecause of his years with the CIA, but because of his service in World War II,which included arranging the surrender of German troops in Italy. It is nowacknowledged that Dulles withheld CIA information from the Warren Commission,particularly concerning assassination plots between the agency and organizedcrime.Representative Gerald Ford (R-Michigan): Former President Ford is now recognizedas the FBI’s “spy” on the Warren Commission. This is confirmed by a memo fromCartha DeLoach, a close aide to Director Hoover, in which he noted:I had a long talk this morning [December 12, 1963] with congressman Gerald R.“Jerry” Ford. . . . He asked that I come up and see him. . . . Ford indicated hewould keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the Commission. Hestated this would have to be on a confidential basis, however, he thought itshould be done. He also asked if he could call me from time to time andstraighten out questions in his mind concerning our investigation. I told him byall means he should do this. He reiterated that our relationship would, ofcourse, remain confidential.According to former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, “Ford [also]enjoyed the reputation of being the CIA’s best friend in the House ofRepresentatives.”Ford’s name as a member of the Warren Commission was recommended to PresidentJohnson by Richard Nixon. A World War II Navy veteran, Ford became theCommission’s most industrious member, hearing seventy out of the ninety-fourwitnesses who actually met with commissioners. He also profited from his time onthe Commission. Ford had his first campaign manager and former Nixonpresidential campaign field director John R. Stiles hired as his specialassistant. Ford and Stiles went on to write Portrait of the Assassin, a bookthat presented selective evidence of Oswald’s guilt. When their publisher foundthe book dull reading, Ford and Stiles spiced it up with rewritten transcriptsof the January 27, 1964, Commission meeting where Oswald’s possible connectionto the FBI was discussed. The minutes of this meeting were classified top secretand remained closed to the public. During confirmation hearings before theSenate Judiciary Committee in 1973, Ford was asked specifically about his use ofclassified Warren Commission material in his book. Ford replied, “We did not usein that book any material other than the material that was in the 26 volumes oftestimony and other exhibits that were subsequently made public and sold to thepublic generally.”When it was discovered that the January 27, 1974, meeting transcripts were stillclassified, Ford belatedly said, “I cannot help but apologize if thecircumstances are such that there was this violation, but there certainly was noattempt to do it.”Despite being caught in perjury, Ford was dutifully confirmed by his old friendsin Congress and sworn in as this nation’s first appointed president. Six monthslater, Ford ordered the Commission material in question declassified.John J. McCloy: As coordinator for the Kennedy administration’s disarmamentsactivities since 1961, McCloy had a background for supporting Nazis, both beforeand after the war, and was a ranking member of the Council on Foreign Relations.He had been assistant secretary of war throughout World War II, militarygovernor and high commissioner for Germany from 1949 to 1952, and president ofthe World Bank from 1947 to 1949. He also help build the US intelligenceEstablishment after the war. Despite his continued defense of the WarrenCommission, McCloy himself voiced a prophetic skepticism of its work on December5, 1963, stating, “The Commission is going to be criticized . . . no matter whatwe do, but I think we would be more criticized if we simply posed before theworld as something that is evaluating Government agencies’ reports, whothemselves may be culpable.”In Commission arguments over the “single-bullet theory,” it was McCloy whofinally proposed that the evidence supporting this theory be called“persuasive,” a term all members finally agreed upon.Senator Richard B. Russell (D-Georgia): As chairman of the powerful Senate ArmedServices Committee, Russell carried much clout on Capitol Hill, usually employedto further the aims of the Pentagon. His work on behalf of defense projectsbrought sizable government contracts to Georgia. Governor there from 1931 to1933, Russell was elected to the Senate in 1933. Russell also sat on thewatchdog Subcommittee on CIA Oversight. Russell, widely regarded as one of themost intelligent senators, became the first Warren Commission member to publiclyquestion its conclusions. In a 1970 Washington Post article, Russell said he hadcome to believe that a criminal conspiracy had resulted in Kennedy’s death. Thesenator even worked with assassination researcher Harold Weisberg in an effortto obtain Commission transcripts. In a court affidavit, Weisberg stated,“Privately Senator Russell told me that he was convinced that there were twoareas in which Warren Commission members had been deceived by Federal agenciesresponsible for investigating the assassination of President Kennedy. These twoareas were: (1) Oswald’s background; and (2) the ballistics evidence.”[images/line.jpg]As can be seen, all of the Commission members had long-standing ties to both themilitary and intelligence establishments of the United States. They also weremen accustomed to the delicacy of dealing with highly sensitive politicalissues.Each had received a copy of White House Executive Order 11130, which afternaming the seven members of the President’s Commission, stated the Commission’spurpose was to “uncover all the facts concerning the assassination of PresidentKennedy and to determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknownpersons at home or abroad,” and that “necessary expenses” of the Commissionwould be paid from the “Emergency Fund for the President.”In an effort to obtain fairness for her son, Marguerite Oswald wrote to WarrenCommission general counsel J. Lee Rankin and even President Johnson, stating, “I[am] . . . imploring both in the name of justice and our American way of life tolet my son Lee Harvey Oswald be represented by council [sic] so that allwitnesses including my son’s widow will be cross-examined.”Her request was denied.New York attorney Mark Lane, who in 1959 helped found the Reform DemocraticMovement, volunteered to represent Oswald.His request was denied.In 1964, Lane was retained by Marguerite Oswald to represent her son’s interestbut the Commission refused to accept him. Lane explained his persistence bywriting:In all likelihood there does not exist a single American community where reside12 men or women, good and true, who presume that Lee Harvey Oswald did notassassinate President Kennedy. No more savage comment can be made in referenceto the breakdown of the Anglo-Saxon system of jurisprudence. At the veryfoundation of our judicial operation lies a cornerstone which shelters theinnocent and guilty alike against group hysteria, manufactured evidence,overzealous law enforcement officials, in short, against those factors whichmilitate for an automated, prejudged, neatly packaged verdict of guilty. It isthe sacred right of every citizen accused of committing a crime to thepresumption of innocence.In fact, every basic legal right guaranteed to even the lowliest streetcriminal—the right to legal representation, to face accusers, to cross-examinewitnesses and evidence—was denied Lee Harvey Oswald. The Commission met behindclosed doors, heard secret testimony, and emerged to announce its conclusions.The Warren Commission’s first official meeting took place on December 5, 1963.The primary purpose of this meeting was to get the investigation organized.During this process, Warren suggested that the Commission need not hire its owninvestigators or obtain subpoena powers from Congress. He was, however,overridden in this matter by other Commission members. McCloy stated:I have a feeling that we have another obligation than the mere evaluation of thereports of agencies, many of which as you suggested, or some of them at least,may be interested, may be involved. There is a potential culpability here on thepart of the Secret Service and even the FBI, and these reports . . . may havesome self-serving aspects in them. And I think that if we didn’t have the rightto subpoena documents, the right to subpoena witnesses if we needed them, thatthis Commission’s general standing might be somewhat impaired.Not wishing to appear as simply a conduit for information from federal agencies,Commission members appealed to Congress for the right to issue subpoenas. Thiswas granted on December 13, 1963, by the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 137.This law also authorized the Commission to compel testimony by providingimmunity from prosecution—an authority that the Commission never once used.During this meeting, Senator Russell noted the ongoing leaks of assassinationinformation by the FBI while Commission members were still awaiting the bureau’sfirst full report. He asked pointedly, “How much of their findings does the FBIpropose to release to the press before we present the findings of thisCommission?”This was the beginning of a quiet—yet intense—feud between the Commission andHoover’s bureau.The Commission’s second meeting was on December 6. There was considerablediscussion about the proposed Texas court of inquiry. State Attorney GeneralCarr had traveled from Texas to Washington but was put off from meeting withWarren for three days because the chief justice wanted a formal promise thatthere would be no Texas hearings until after his commission had completed itsinvestigation. Warren read from a letter he had sent Carr stating, “It is theview of this Commission . . . that a public inquiry in Texas at this time mightbe more harmful than helpful in our search for the truth.”It was during this meeting that the name of J. Lee Rankin was advanced as apossible general counsel for the Commission. Warren originally wanted WarrenOlney III, head of the FBI Criminal division from 1953 to 1957, as chiefcounsel. However, Olney, an outspoken critic of director J. Edgar Hoover andmost knowledgeable about the internal workings of the bureau, was rejected afterthe powerful Hoover voiced fierce opposition to his appointment, an indicationof the director’s power over the investigation.The Commission then recessed until December 16, when it reviewed the firstformal report on the assassination issued by the FBI on December 9. Warren setthe tone by commenting, “Well, gentlemen, to be very frank about it, I have readthat FBI report two or three times and I have not seen anything in there yetthat has not been in the press.”Boggs commented, “Reading that FBI report leaves a million questions.”Dulles said the CIA couldn’t finalize a report until the agency received moredocuments from the FBI. He commented, “They’ve been working for a long while, Iknow. It started when I was there.” This was the first admission that the CIAhad been keeping an eye on Oswald since his trip to Russia in 1959.On December 8, 1963, J. Lee Rankin, a fifty-six-year-old corporate attorney andUS solicitor general under Eisenhower, had accepted the appointment as generalcounsel for the Commission and met for the first time with the commissioners.Rankin would take charge of the Commission’s investigation, serve as the primaryliaison between the Commission and both the FBI and CIA, and act as coordinatorbetween Commission members and the staff. Years later, one Commission attorneycommented, “It was, very simply, a Rankin operation.” And Rankin appeared moreconcerned with wrapping up the Commission’s investigation swiftly than withfully probing each assassination issue.When Commission assistant counsel Wesley Liebeler submitted a twenty-six-pagememorandum to Rankin carefully outlining the serious deficiencies of theevidence against Oswald as the lone assassin, Rankin reportedly replied, “Nomore memorandums. The report has to be published.”On another occasion when Liebeler tried to address the problems arising from theSilvia Odio affair, an angry Rankin said, “At this stage, we are supposed to beclosing doors, not opening them.”Initially, even Rankin voiced the suspicion that the Commission might have to domore than simply evaluate FBI reports. During the December 16 meeting, hestated:The Chief Justice and I finally came to the conclusion . . . that we might haveto . . . ask for some investigative help . . . because we might not get all weneeded by just going back to the FBI and other agencies because the [FBI] reporthas so many loopholes in it. Anybody can look at it and see that it just doesn’tseem like they’re looking for things that this Commission has to look for inorder to get the answers that it wants and is entitled to. . . . [This] might bea tender spot. I am sure the FBI is certainly tender about the knowledge theyhad [concerning Oswald’s presence in Dallas] and the fact that the SecretService did not have that knowledge in order to do anything about it.On January 21, 1964, the Commission met for the fourth time. Warrenoptimistically predicted an early end to the investigation, although therecontinued to be debate over whether to hurry up the Commission’s work prior tothe election-year conventions or slow it down pending the outcome of the Texastrial of Jack Ruby, which was about to begin.A lengthy discussion ensued regarding the Commission’s responsibility toquestion Mrs. Kennedy and the new president, Lyndon Johnson. However, almost adozen pages of this discussion were marked “classified” and kept from thepublic.The Commission then discussed the possibility of moving Oswald’s body, includinganother autopsy and even cremation. Although the transcripts make no mentionthat they suspected impersonation at this time, it is significant to note theCommission’s interest in Oswald’s body. McCloy said, “I don’t think we ought tohave on the record that we are moving in this thing [an Oswald exhumation]. Weare not saying anything about it.” In response to news articles that MarinaOswald was being held against her will, Warren suggested allowing someone withthe American Civil Liberties Union to meet with her. Rankin added, “We do have alittle problem because the Secret Service came to us and said, ‘Shall we quitour surveillance over her?’ . . . I said we can’t do that because she would slipright across the border and be gone.”The Commission again grappled with the problem of interagency rivalries. Andagain the issue of FBI reliability was raised, this time in connection with theconflicting information commissioners were getting concerning the president’swounds. McCloy said, “Let’s find out about these wounds, it is just as confusingnow as could be. It left my mind muddy as to what really did happen. . . . Whydid the FBI report come out with something which isn’t consistent with theautopsy?”Senator Russell even suggested double-checking the FBI studies, but no actionwas taken.Oswald and the FBI [Contents.html#rsec85]On January 22, 1964, the Warren Commission was hurriedly called into secretsession because of the explosive news that Texas authorities had informationthat Oswald had been an undercover informant for the FBI. Reports of thismeeting were not made public until 1975.Rankin told members:Yes, it was being rumored that [Oswald] was an undercover agent. Now it issomething that would be very difficult to prove out. There are events inconnection with this that are curious, in that they might make it possible tocheck some of it out in time. I assume that the FBI records would never show it. . . or if their records do show anything, I would think their records wouldshow some kind of number that could be assigned to a dozen different peopleaccording to how they wanted to describe them. . . . [Oswald] did use postalboxes practically every place he went, and that would be an ideal way to getmoney to anyone that you wanted as an undercover agent.Rankin wondered aloud if Oswald had been operating for the FBI during his tripto Russia, but Warren pointed out “They haven’t any people in Russia.” Rankinwas still wondering, “One of the strange things that happened . . . is the factthat this man who is a defector, and who was under observation at least by theFBI . . . could [obtain] a passport that permitted him to go to Russia.”Rankin then connected his musings to the Commission’s problems with the bureau:The FBI is very explicit that Oswald is the assassin or was the assassin, andthey are very explicit that there was no conspiracy, and [yet] they are alsosaying in the same place that they are continuing their investigation. Now in myexperience of almost nine years, in the first place it is hard to get them tosay when you think you have got a case tight enough to convict somebody. . . .In my experience with the FBI, they don’t do that. They claim that they don’tevaluate. . . . Secondly, they have not run out of all kinds of leads in Mexicoor in Russia and so forth which they could probably. . . . But they areconcluding that there can’t be a conspiracy without those [leads] being run out.Now that is not [normal] from my experience with the FBI. . . . It raisesquestions.The specter of Oswald’s being identified as an FBI agent caused great difficultyfor the Commission. There appeared no way to fully resolve the matter, and asRepresentative Boggs pointed out, “[The] implications of this are fantastic,don’t you think so? . . . I don’t even like to see this being taken down.”Dulles agreed, “Yes, I think this record ought to be destroyed.” But it wasn’t.Five days after this secret meeting, the Commission met formally. The minutes ofthis meeting, on January 27, 1964, show that commissioners were still agonizingover Oswald’s possible involvement with the FBI. More than two hours of itsthree-and-a-half-hour afternoon session were spent trying to decide how tobroach the subject with director J. Edgar Hoover. The problem was compounded byrumors that added the CIA to Oswald’s suspected intelligence connections.The stories of Oswald’s spy connections were traced back from Texas attorneygeneral Waggoner Carr to Dallas County district attorney Henry Wade and morespecifically assistant district attorney William Alexander. Alexander claimed hegot the story from Houston Post reporter Alonzo Hudkins, who said he got it fromDallas County deputy sheriff Allan Sweatt. Sweatt revealed his source for thestory was none other than Alexander—who was on the scene of the Tippit slayingand reportedly also present at Oswald’s capture at the Texas Theater.Apparently no attempt was made to determine just where Alexander got hisinformation that Oswald was being paid $200 a month as FBI informant S-179.Rankin dismissed the possibility of approaching attorney general Robert Kennedywith the problem, saying, “As the head of the [Justice] department, the FBI, ofcourse, is under the attorney general, but I think we must frankly recognizeamongst ourselves that there is a daily relationship there . . . and we wouldn’twant to make that more difficult.”He then raised the possibility of going straight to FBI director J. EdgarHoover. But since Hoover was already on record denying that Oswald had anyconnection with the bureau, Commission members were hesitant to anger the dourHoover by initiating their own inquiries. Senator Russell noted, “There is noman in the employ of the federal government who stands higher in the opinion ofthe American people than J. Edgar Hoover.”Furthermore, Commission member Allen Dulles, former head of the CIA, whileadmitting that government agencies and even local police departments employed“terribly bad characters” as undercover agents, bluntly implied there was no wayto prove such allegations during the following exchange:REP. BOGGS: Let’s say [someone] . . . was recruited by someone in the CIA. Theman who recruited him would know, wouldn’t he?DULLES: Yes, but he wouldn’t tell.CHAIRMAN WARREN: Wouldn’t tell it under oath?DULLES: I wouldn’t think he would tell it under oath, no. . . . He ought nottell it under oath. Maybe not tell it to his own government but wouldn’t tell itany other way.MCCLOY: Wouldn’t he tell it to his own chief?DULLES: He might or might not. If he was a bad one then he wouldn’t.Dulles added that he would not reveal CIA business to anyone except thepresident and that questioning Hoover would not necessarily get to the truth. Heexplained:If [Hoover] says no, I didn’t have anything to do with it. You can’t prove whatthe facts are. There are no external evidences. I would believe Mr. Hoover. Somepeople might not. I don’t think there is any external evidence other than theperson’s word that he did or did not employ a particular man as a secret agent.No matter what.McCloy voiced the Commission’s exasperation with its total dependence on theFBI: “The time is almost overdue for us to have a better perspective of the FBIinvestigation than we now have. . . . We are so dependent upon them for ourfacts.”Commission members also were becoming suspicious that the bureau was not beingtotally open with them regarding certain aspects of the assassination. Forexample, Rankin recalled that Marina Oswald said her husband met with two FBIagents for nearly two hours shortly after their return from Russia, but added,“We don’t have any report that would cover anything like a two-hourconversation.”Senator Russell summed up the Commission’s dilemma: “It seems to me we have twoalternatives. One is we can just accept the FBI’s report and go on and write thereport based on their findings and supported by the raw materials they gave us,or else we can go and try to run down some of these collateral rumors that havejust not been dealt with directly in this raw material that we have.”The Commission decided to allow Rankin to approach Hoover in the manner hethought best. But after all was said and done, the Warren Commission elected toaccept the FBI’s information and conclusions without independent verification.[images/line.jpg]During the same meeting that commissioners agonized over Oswald’s possibleconnection with the FBI, Rankin outlined at length the six major areas of theCommission’s investigation.Area one was “The Basic Facts of the Assassination,” dealing with the number andsource of the shots. In charge of this area were Commission assistant counselsFrancis W. H. Adams, who had served as a special assistant to the US attorney aswell as police commissioner and chief assistant US attorney in New York City,and Arlen Specter, a Yale Law School graduate and an assistant district attorneyin Philadelphia. In March 1964, Adams announced he could not fulfill hisresponsibility in the investigation. Specter went on to singlehandedly managethis critical area.Area two was to establish the “Identity of the Assassin.” In charge were DavidBelin, an Iowa attorney with a distinguished academic record, and Joseph A.Ball, an Iowa-born attorney who was teaching criminal law and procedure at theUniversity of Southern California. An investigation into the murder of policemanJ. D. Tippit belatedly was added.Area three was a study of “Oswald’s Background,” an aspect of the probe thatclearly indicated the Commission’s predisposition toward Oswald’s guilt.Area four was to determine “Possible Conspiratorial Relationships.” It washeaded by William T. Coleman Jr., a Pennsylvania attorney who had served as lawclerk to US Court of Appeals judge Herbert F. Goodrich and Supreme Court JusticeFelix Frankfurter as well as a consultant with the US Arms Control andDisarmament Agency, and W. David Slawson, a Denver, Colorado, attorney educatedat Amherst College, Princeton, and Yale.Area five was the study of “Oswald’s Death.” In charge were Burt Griffin andLeon Hubert, both former assistant US attorneys.Area six was added later and dealt with “Presidential Protection,” a study ofthe security precautions of the Secret Service and the FBI. Samuel Stern, aformer law clerk to Chief Justice Warren, was assigned to the job, but ChiefCounsel Rankin supervised this “politically sensitive area.”Rankin also outlined the questions already arising over the medical evidence. Hesaid:We think that the wound in the neck has to be related to one of these others,but the problem is difficult to determine because we have a statement from thehospital that the bullet that was more whole than the other was found on thestretcher which they brought the President in to the hospital on and then wehave testimony later that goes back over the same ground . . . [saying] thatthis bullet was found under the blanket on the stretcher Gov. Connally was on.It was the beginning of years of controversy over the basic medical andballistic evidence.As with the later House Select Committee on Assassinations, the WarrenCommission asked many experts with lengthy credentials to evaluate variousassassination evidence, such as Oswald’s fingerprints and ballistics. And aswith the House committee, while these experts supported the government’sconclusions, none of them could later state with any certainty that thematerials they received from the government were originals. But the possibilitythat someone within the government would substitute or fabricate evidence neverseemed to cross the minds of the experts or the commissioners.There also was controversy over Oswald’s description as a loner. Rankin told thecommissioners, “We have no evidence that is clear that Oswald was connected withanybody but we also have very great problems.” In regard to Oswald’s life inRussia, Rankin commented, “That entire period is just full of possibilities fortraining, for working with the Soviets, and its agents.”On February 24, 1964, Warren, senator John Cooper, representative Gerald Ford,Allen Dulles, and Rankin met for about ten minutes. Rankin reported nosignificant progress in the problem area of Oswald’s possible connection withthe FBI. He said affidavits from Hoover, FBI agents, and even Dallas officials“show negative.” However, he also reported one instance of the bureau’s lack ofcandor with the Commission, explaining:As you recall, we informed you before that the address in the telephone book ofLee Oswald had in it the name of [FBI agent James] Hosty and his telephonenumber and his automobile license, and that it wasn’t in the transcript of thatinformation which was furnished to us by the FBI. And we have written to the FBIto ask them, an official inquiry, how that could happen, and to furnish us allof the information concerning that occurrence. And we have not received a replyyet.On March 16, 1964, three and a half months after its inception, the WarrenCommission met again. This three-minute session was to approve a resolutiongoverning the questioning of witnesses by Commission staff members. Only Warren,Cooper, Ford, McCloy, and Rankin attended.Jack Ruby’s trial had ended on March 14, and at this point the real WarrenCommission investigation began. On March 18, Commission staff attorneys flew toDallas and set up a field station in the offices of US Attorney BarefootSanders.Also in March the “more important” witnesses were called to testify over aperiod of fourteen days. By April, the number of days spent hearing testimonyhad dropped to seven.On April 30, 1964, the Commission met again. Commissioners Ford, Boggs, andRussell were absent. Senator Cooper left the two-hour meeting after only thirtyminutes. Though nearly five months had passed, Commissioners were stillconcerned about the contradictions in the investigative material. The questionof Oswald’s involvement with the FBI and CIA remained unresolved.Cooper expressed his concern over contradictions between the testimony ofwitnesses to Commission attorneys and news media reports of interviews with thesame witnesses.Conflicts in the Testimony [Contents.html#rsec86]The questions Cooper raised remain valid today. Only a few assassinationresearchers have seen fit to study the problems between what some Commissionwitnesses actually said and what was reported.If basic conflicts exist in the Warren Commission testimony, then all of it—usedas primary evidence in all studies of the Kennedy assassination—must bereevaluated. In fact, a close scrutiny of this issue brings out deeply troublinginstances of suppressing evidence and intimidating witnesses.The first problem with Warren Commission testimony is omissions. Despite whatwas hailed at the time as one of the most thorough investigations of all time, areview of the Warren Commission’s performance reveals glaring deficiencies.In their report, commissioners devoted more than a page to a detailed discussionof Lee Harvey Oswald’s pubic hair. In their volumes, several pages were used toreproduce Marguerite Oswald’s tax and house payment receipts, some dating backinto the 1930s, and the dental records of Jack Ruby’s mother.Many other pages were filled with meaningless and irrelevant testimony, such asthat of Anne Boudreaux, who never met either Oswald or his mother but did know awoman who once babysat for the infant Oswald; that of Viola Peterman, a formerneighbor of Marguerite Oswald’s who had not seen her for twenty-seven years; andthat of Professor Revilo Pendleton Oliver, who took up thirty-five pages oftestimony to discuss an article he had written that had no bearing on the JFKassassination.Yet many pertinent witnesses were never asked to tell what they knew. Theseincluded:—James Chaney, the motorcycle policeman closest to Kennedy during theassassination who told newsmen he saw the president “struck in the face” by thefinal shot.—Bill and Gayle Newman, two of the bystanders closest to Kennedy at the time ofthe fatal head shot, who stated that shots came from directly behind them on theGrassy Knoll.—Charles Brehm, a former US Army Ranger combat veteran and one of the closestbystanders to Kennedy when he was shot.—J. C. Price, who from his bird’s-eye perch on top of the Terminal Annexbuilding witnessed the entire assassination and then told of seeing a man with arifle running behind the wooden picket fence on top of the Grassy Knoll.—Milton Jones, who told the FBI that he was on a Dallas bus that was boarded andsearched by Dallas police after Oswald had gotten off, although at that time noone knew that Oswald was a suspect.—Mary Dowling, a waitress at Dallas’s Dobbs House restaurant who told the FBIthat Policeman Tippit had been in the restaurant on November 20, when Oswald wasthere making a fuss over his food.—James Simmons, a Union Railroad employee who supported Sam Holland in hiscontention that shots came from behind the picket fence on the Grassy Knoll.—Richard Dodd, another railroad employee who told of hearing shots and seeingsmoke come from behind the picket fence.—Alonzo Hudkins, the Houston newspaperman who reported that Dallas officialstold him that Oswald was an informant for the FBI.—Ray Rushing, an evangelist who claimed to have ridden in an elevator at Dallaspolice headquarters with Jack Ruby about two hours before Ruby murdered Oswaldand at a time when Ruby reportedly was at his home.—Lieutenant George Butler, the Dallas police official in charge of Oswald’stransfer November 24 and who was reported to have been in an extremely agitatedcondition by newspaperman Thayer Waldo.—Admiral George Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician who rode in the motorcade,was with Kennedy at Parkland Hospital, rode with Air Force One on the trip backto Washington, was present at the Bethesda autopsy, and received all of theofficial medical evidence, much of which is now in controversy.—John T. Stringer and Lieutenant William Pitzer, who photographed and X-rayedKennedy’s body at Bethesda Naval Hospital.—James Sibert and Francis O’Neill, two FBI agents who attended Kennedy’s autopsyand made a report that contradicts some of the official conclusions.—Richard Randolph Carr, a steelworker who reported seeing two men run frombehind the Texas School Book Depository and drive off in a Rambler stationwagon.—Marvin Robinson, a motorist in Dealey Plaza who corroborated deputy sheriffRoger Craig’s claim that Oswald entered a westbound Rambler station wagon infront of the Depository minutes after the assassination.The omission of these people’s testimony appears to go far beyond inefficiencyor oversight. It seems rather to support the charges by Warren Commissioncritics that the panel avoided information that conflicted with theirpreconceived determination that Oswald was the lone assassin.Conclusions reached by the Warren Commission—particularly the single-bullettheory—were contradicted by medical evidence, the witnesses, and governor JohnConnally. Therefore, the Commission chose to simply ignore them.Some witnesses the Commission questioned, either directly or by deposition, havetold researchers and news reporters that their testimony was altered. Otherssimply shrugged off their superficial questioning. Railroad supervisor LeeBowers later said, “I was there to tell them only what they asked and when theywanted to cut off the conversation, I figured that was the end of it.”Witnesses Butch Burroughs, Jean Hill, Phil Willis, Orville Nix, James Tague, andothers have stated that their testimony as presented by the Commission did notaccurately reflect what they said.While every Commission witness had the opportunity to review his or hertestimony for accuracy, as far as can be determined, few took advantage of theoffer. As one person put it, “I trust you.”One Warren Commission witness voiced her complaints to the FBI. Nancy Powell,better known as Ruby stripper Tammi True, talked to agents in August 1964. Intheir report, the agents stated:Mrs. Powell complained that she did not feel that her testimony had beenrecorded accurately in the deposition. It was explained to Mrs. Powell thatpersons, while conversing, give meaning to their words through voiceinflections, and that reading the words without inflections sometimes givesdifferent meaning to the words which was not meant. . . . At that time shestated to me that the deposition as written was not acceptable to her,particularly in the area where she was questioned relative to Jack Ruby and toany part that Ruby may have played in the assassination. . . . Mrs. Powellstated it would be impossible for her to make corrections in the deposition aswritten because to make her testimony “sound right I would have to change thequestions of [Commission attorney Burt] Griffin.”Witness Sam Holland was one of the few to attempt to correct his WarrenCommission testimony. Holland told author Josiah Thompson he and his attorneyattempted to correct the transcript. “We red marked . . . red penciled thatstatement from beginning to end because there were a lot of errors in it,” herecalled. Holland said apparently his corrections were lost somewhere along theline, because “the statement that I made, as well as I remember, isn’t incontext with the Warren Commission.” He told Commission critic Mark Lane, “TheWarren Commission, I think, had to report in their book what they wanted theworld to believe. . . . It had to read like they wanted it to read. They had toprove that Oswald did it alone.”Ronald Fischer, one of the bystanders who saw a man in the sixth-floor window inthe minutes preceding the assassination, later said he almost got into a fightwith a Commission attorney who was trying to get him to change his story. In aninterview with the Dallas Morning News in 1978, Fischer said assistant counselDavid Belin tried to intimidate him: “[Belin] and I had a fight almost in theinterview room over the color of the man’s hair. He wanted me to tell him thatthe man was dark-headed and I wouldn’t do it. [Oswald’s hair] doesn’t appear tome in the photographs as light as the man that I saw and that’s what Belin wasupset about. I see it now, but I didn’t see it at the time.”Roger Craig, the Dallas deputy sheriff who claimed to see Oswald escape in astation wagon, years later wrote about his experience with the WarrenCommission: “Combine the [harassment at his work] with the run-in I had withDave Belin, junior counsel for the Warren Commission, who questioned me inApril, 1964, and who changed my testimony fourteen times when he sent it toWashington, and you will have some ideas of the pressure brought to bear.”Julia Ann Mercer, the woman who claimed to have seen Jack Ruby behind the wheelof a truck in Dealey Plaza about an hour and a half before the assassination,subsequently told investigators for New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrisonthat the FBI altered several key portions of her statement and that even hersignature was forged on a Dallas County sheriff’s report that supported thealtered FBI documents.Phil Willis, who took a series of photographs of the assassination, wassurprised when he was asked only to give a deposition rather than to testify. Hetold this author:This guy came to Dallas and took my deposition. He took down only what he wantedto hear. I tried to tell him about the shots and the echoes but he wasn’tinterested. He just seemed to want to get it over with. The Warren Commissionnever subpoenaed any photographer. They weren’t interested in talking to me orZapruder. It seems strange to me. It’s not much of a way to conduct aninvestigation.Willis’s daughter, Linda Pipes, also witnessed the assassination. She said, “Ivery much agree [with Willis] that shots came from somewhere else other than theDepository. And where we were standing [across Elm from the Depository], we hada good view. . . . [Representatives of the Warren Commission] talked to melater, but they didn’t seem to be investigating very thoroughly.”Phil Willis summed up his experience in a 1988 British TV interview: “All theywanted to know was that three shots came from the Book Depository. That’s allthat got into the Warren Commission [Report]. . . . I’m certain that at leastone shot came from the right front. I’ll stand by that to my grave!”Recall that Chester Breneman and Robert West, the two Dallas surveyors who inMay 1964 produced the height and distance figures for the Commission’sreenactment of the assassination, reported their figures “at odds” with thefigures the Warren Commission published. The consequence of these alterednumbers was to make the controversial single-bullet theory more plausible bysimply moving back the time when both Kennedy and Connally were wounded.The experience of former Texas senator Ralph Yarborough also sheds light on themanner in which the Commission allowed key witnesses to be handled. The factthat Yarborough was riding beside Lyndon Johnson in the motorcade may explainhis treatment in the summer of 1964. He described it this way:After I wrote them, you see, a couple of fellows came to see me. They walked inlike they were a couple of deputy sheriffs and I was a bank robber. I didn’tlike their attitude. As a senator I felt insulted. They went off and wrote upsomething and brought it back for me to sign. But I refused. I threw it in adrawer and let it lay there for weeks. And they had on there the last sentencewhich stated “This is all I know about the assassination.” They wanted me tosign this thing, then say this is all I know. Of course, I would never havesigned it. Finally, after some weeks, they began to bug me. “You’re holding thisup, you’re holding this up” they said, demanding that I sign the report. So Ityped one up myself and put basically what I told you about how the cars allstopped. I put in there, “I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings but for theprotection of future presidents, they should be trained to take off when a shotis fired.” I sent that over. That’s dated July 10, 1964, after theassassination. To my surprise, when the volumes were finally printed and cameout, I was surprised at how many people down at the White House didn’t filetheir affidavits until after the date, after mine the 10th of July, waiting tosee what I was going to say before they filed theirs. I began to lose confidencethen in their investigation and that’s further eroded with time.Yarborough also was shocked to find that all vital assassination information wassent to President Johnson before it ever went to the Warren Commission or evenattorney general Robert Kennedy.Perhaps one of the most shocking statements regarding treatment at the hands ofthe Warren Commission came from witness Jean Hill. Fearful to speak out foryears, Hill came forward in the spring of 1986 and told her story to a group ofassassination researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington.After witnessing a rifleman firing from the Grassy Knoll and immediately beinggrabbed by two men who claimed to be Secret Service agents, she was advised byfriends in the Dallas Police Department to keep quiet about what she knew. Evenafter she received a subpoena to appear before the Warren Commission, the samefriends urged that she not go to Washington. She recalled, “They seemed to feelthat there might be some danger if I was to leave Dallas. They told me Iwouldn’t come back.”After Hill refused to go to Washington, Commission attorney Arlen Specter sentFBI agents to take her to make a deposition. She recalled that experience forthis author:The FBI took me to Parkland Hospital. I had no idea what I was doing there. Theyescorted me through a labyrinth of corridors and up to one of the top floors ofParkland. I didn’t know where we were. They took me into this little room whereI met Arlen Specter. He talked to me for a few minutes, trying to act realfriendly, then this woman, a stenographer, came in and sat behind me.He had told me that this interview would be confidential, then I looked aroundand this woman was taking notes. I reminded him that the discussion was to beprivate and he told the woman to put down her notebook, which she did. But whenI looked around again she was writing. I got mad and told Specter, “You lied tome. I want this over.” He asked me why I wouldn’t come to Washington, and Isaid, “Because I want to stay alive.” He asked why I would think that I was indanger and I replied, “Well, if they can kill the president, they can certainlyget me!” He replied that they already had the man that did it and I told him,“No, you don’t!”He kept trying to get me to change my story, particularly regarding the numberof shots. He said I had been told how many shots there were and I figured he wastalking about what the Secret Service told me right after the assassination. Hisinflection and attitude was that I knew what I was supposed to be saying, whywouldn’t I just say it. I asked him, “Look, do you want the truth or just whatyou want me to say?” He said he wanted the truth, so I said, “The truth is thatI heard between four and six shots.” I told him, “I’m not going to lie for you.”So he starts talking off the record. He told me about my life, my family, andeven mentioned that my marriage was in trouble. I said, “What’s the point ofinterviewing me if you already know everything about me?” He got angrier andangrier and finally told me, “Look, we can make you look as crazy as MargueriteOswald and everybody knows how crazy she is. We could have you put in a mentalinstitution if you don’t cooperate with us.” I knew he was trying to intimidateme. I kept asking to see that woman’s notes, to see what she was putting down. Iknew something was not right about this, because no one who is just taking adeposition gets that involved and angry, they just take your answers.He finally gave me his word that the interview would not be published unless Iapproved what was written. But they never gave me the chance to read it orapprove it. When I finally read my testimony as published by the WarrenCommission, I knew it was a fabrication from the first line. After that ordealat Parkland Hospital, they wrote that my deposition was taken at the USattorney’s office in the Post Office Building.Even Kennedy’s own people were not immune to such pressures. In 1975 a CIAliaison told congressional investigators that two of Kennedy’s aides, KennethO’Donnell and David Powers, initially said shots came from other than theDepository, but later changed their story after being warned by J. Edgar Hooveror one of his top aides that such testimony would only arouse public passionsand could lead to an international incident. Both O’Donnell and Powers deniedthis story when it appeared in a Chicago newspaper column. But the story wasconfirmed in 1987 with the publication of former House speaker Thomas P. “Tip”O’Neill’s book, Man of the House. He related:I was never one of those people who had doubts or suspicions about the WarrenCommission’s report on the president’s death. But five years after Jack died, Iwas having dinner with (former JFK aide) Kenny O’Donnell. . . . I was surprisedto hear O’Donnell say that he was sure he had heard two shots from behind thefence. “That’s not what you told the Warren Commission,” I said. “You’re right,”he replied. “I told the FBI what I had heard, but they said it couldn’t havehappened that way and that I must have been imagining things. So I testified theway they wanted me to. I just didn’t want to stir up any more pain and troublefor the family.” Dave Powers was with us at dinner that night, and hisrecollection of the shots was the same as O’Donnell’s. Kenny O’Donnell is nolonger alive, but during the writing of this book I checked with Dave Powers. Asthey say in the news business, he stands by his story.Considering the information presented in this section, it appears the sins ofthe Warren Commission went far beyond a few omissions and distortions. Littlewonder that the vast majority of Americans today place little credence in theCommission’s findings of a lone assassin and no conspiracy. Once again thecharge of cover-up can be laid at the feet of the federal government.[images/line.jpg]During the April 30 Commission meeting J. Lee Rankin openly admitted that theJune 1 date for closing the investigation was unreasonable.A brief discussion was held regarding Jack Ruby, who had been found guilty andbeen sentenced to death. However, his attorneys were appealing the conviction onthe grounds of his mental incompetence. When one member asked if Ruby would goto prison, Commissioner McCloy responded, “He goes to a mental institution. Itis perfectly clear we cannot examine him at this stage.” Rankin again referredto the problems arising from the contradictory medical evidence and suggestedthat some Commission members and a doctor should study the autopsy photographs“so that they could report to the commission that there is nothing inconsistentwith the other findings.” Warren added, “But without putting those pictures inour record. We don’t want those in our record. . . . It would make it a morbidthing for all time to come.”The inaccessibility of Kennedy’s autopsy X-rays and photographs have been acornerstone of the criticism of the Warren Commission.Before adjourning, commissioners agreed on the necessity of including abiography of Lee Harvey Oswald in their final report. It is significant to readRankin’s explanation at this time—five months before their final report—forincluding Oswald’s background: “Some of it will be necessary to tell the storyand to show why it is reasonable to assume that he did what the commissionconcludes that he did do.”On April 10, 1964, in a memo to Commission assistant counsel Albert Jennerregarding a chronology of Oswald’s background by staffer John Hart Ely, Rankinwrote, “Our depositions and examinations of records and other data disclose thatthere are details in Mr. Ely’s memoranda which will require material alterationand, in some instances, omission.”Despite the questions, contradictions, and gaps in the evidence at hand and withalterations and omissions, Oswald’s guilt was already decided.The Single-Bullet Theory [Contents.html#rsec87]Nowhere was the manipulation of the facts more evident than the government’sattempt to reconcile the ballistic and medical evidence by offering the ideathat both President Kennedy and Governor Connally were struck by the samebullet.On its face this concept is unpalatable. To believe the single-bullet theory,one must believe that a single rifle slug penetrated two men, causing sevenwounds, shattering a rib and a wrist bone, then emerged almost totally unscathedto become the pristine Commission Exhibit 399.Yet, to disbelieve the single-bullet theory means rejecting the WarrenCommission’s entire version of the assassination. Despite the testimony of manywitnesses, the Warren Commission concluded that only three shots were firedduring the assassination, based solely on three spent shells found on the sixthfloor of the Texas School Book Depository.Having concluded that only three shots were fired—the absolute maximum allowablefor only one assassin within the time frame of the Zapruder film—commissionersset about determining the timing and effects of each shot.In late 1963 and early 1964 there was no problem. Since the FBI early on hadestablished an assassination time sequence by studying the Zapruder film andZapruder’s 8 mm camera, the Commission had a certain time frame to work within.This basis is now known to be questionable.The original FBI and Secret Service reports made it clear that Kennedy wasstruck in the back by the first shot, Governor Connally hit by the second, andthe president’s head wound caused by the third. While this stretched theallowable time for such shooting to the limit—and despite the contradiction ofConnally, who testified he was hit after the first shot—the Commission acceptedthis believable scenario for a time.But then came the problem of James Tague, the man who was struck by a piece ofcement while standing near the Triple Underpass. Initially both the FBI and theWarren Commission tried to ignore Tague. But after assistant US attorney MarthaJo Stroud in Dallas sent commissioners both an account of the Tague wounding anda Dallas news photograph of the bullet mark on the curb, the Commission wasforced to action.In early 1964—while the FBI was denying any curb shot in Dallas—Commissionattorney Arlen Specter learned that JFK autopsy doctor James Humes hadhypothesized that a single bullet could have caused the wounds to both Kennedyand Connally. Specter eagerly latched onto this concept, which neatly explainedhow the two men were wounded by the same shot.However, it is now clear that the Warren Commission knew the single-bullettheory did not fit the facts. Page 193 [Chapter007.html#page_193] of transcriptsfrom the Commission’s January 27, 1964, meeting revealed General CounselRankin’s thoughts on the matter:It seems quite apparent now, since we have the picture of where the bulletentered in the back, that the bullet entered below the shoulder blade to theright of the backbone, which is below the place where the picture shows thebullet came out in the neck band of the shirt in front, and the bullet,according to the autopsy, didn’t strike any bone at all, that particular bullet,and go through so that how it could turn and . . .Rankin stops in midsentence, having reached the point where he too now realizesthat for the single-bullet theory to work requires a rifle bullet withoutstriking bone to course upward and turn in midair, then take a differenttrajectory, a physical impossibility.Yet, despite this early recognition that the single-bullet theory wasimpossible, the Warren Commission Report offered this somewhat vague conclusion:Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the commission todetermine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there is very persuasiveevidence from the experts to indicate that the same bullet which pierced thePresident’s throat also caused Governor Connally’s wounds. However, GovernorConnally’s testimony and certain other factors have given rise to somedifference of opinion as to this probability but there is no question in themind of any member of the Commission that all the shots which caused thePresident’s and Governor Connally’s wounds were fired from the sixth floorwindow of the Texas School Book Depository. The shots which killed PresidentKennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.What was essential was that Kennedy was never shot through the neck, as no exitwound from the throat was ever found.Forensics expert Sherry Fiester said the single-bullet theory hinged ontrajectory, the path of which “widely varied” in studies by the FBI and theHouse committee. She wrote in her 2012 book, Enemy of the Truth: Myth,Forensics, and the Kennedy Assassination, that aligning the trajectory of abullet from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to Kennedy’s twowounds and Connally’s back wound is impossible and therefore “the Single-BulletTheory remains a myth.”Douglas P. Horne, a staff member of the Assassination Records Review Board inthe 1990s, noted, “The absurd single bullet theory of Arlen Specter [was]—apolitical invention rather than a scientific explanation—which has neverconvinced the American people, in spite of the best efforts of the HSCA’sMichael Baden and Robert Blakey, and later Gerald Posner and Vince Bugliosi.”[images/line.jpg]The presumption of Oswald’s guilt was the first topic of a Commission meeting onJune 4, 1964. The Commission had met on May 19, 1964, but records of thatmeeting were kept from the public on the grounds that it dealt only with“personal and medical files.”Also in May, Rankin had told Commission attorneys to “wrap up” theirinvestigations and submit their area chapters by June 1 so that the final reportcould be issued by June 30. By June 1, however, only two attorneys had completeda draft and the deadline had to be moved back.On June 17, it was announced that Commission hearings were completed. On June30, it was announced that the final report would not be issued until after theRepublican National Convention, set to begin July 13.The Commission worked in secrecy, as evidenced by the minutes of an executivesession conducted on June 23, 1964. These were withheld from the public by theNational Archives with the following explanation: “Matters that are . . .specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order [are]to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and arein fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.”The immense pressure to hurry up the investigation and close down the Commissionmay have accounted for the fact that five of the senior attorneys—Francis Adams,William Coleman, Joseph Ball, Leon Hubert, and Albert Jenner—returned to theirprivate practices and made virtually no contribution to the final report.On July 9, 1964, commissioners Allen Dulles and John McCloy met with threepsychiatrists who had been asked to develop a psychological profile on Oswald.During the seven-hour meeting, the psychiatrists went over complex psychologicalconjectures regarding Oswald’s motives, but their interpretations of histhinking were severely limited due to the fact that first, they were operatingunder the assumption of Oswald’s guilt, and second, the material studied wasbased on Commission and FBI reports, which undoubtedly were one-sided. Eventhough the psychiatrists spent hours detailing their theories, they alsocautioned against putting too much confidence in their psychological speculationsince they had not had the opportunity to interview Oswald personally.Yet in its final report the Warren Commission did use the psychiatrists’opinions to underscore the case against Oswald as a lonely and troubled man. Andthe public did not laugh them off. After all, the Warren Commission representedsome of the most prestigious men in the nation.Dulles suspected the truth of the matter when, during a discussion of whether topresent the psychological material in the final report, he opened this dialoguewith Jenner:DULLES: But nobody reads. Don’t believe people read in this country. There willbe a few professors who will read the record . . .JENNER: And a few newspaper reporters who will read parts of it.DULLES: The public will read very little.In its final report, the Warren Commission made no specific reference to thepsychiatric panel. Yet portions of the report presented ideas that originatedwith the doctors. In the report, after fully detailing Oswald’s difficulty withhuman relationships, his discontent with the world, his search for personaltruth and a place in history, his censure of certain aspects of American life,and his professed commitment to Marxism, commissioners wrote, “Out of these andmany other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswaldthere emerged a man capable of assassinating President Kennedy.”With the Commission investigation winding down and most of the senior attorneysgone, the job of writing the Warren Commission Report fell to assistant counselNorman Redlich and staff member Alfred Goldberg. Redlich was a law professor atNew York University School of Law and Dr. Goldberg (a PhD) was a historian forthe US Air Force Historical Division.When Goldberg told Warren it was impossible to complete the report by mid-July,the deadline again was moved back, this time to August 1. Through August,Goldberg and Redlich continued to rewrite the report’s chapters—some as many astwenty times—and the deadline was moved back into September. It was in this timeperiod that Commission member Gerald Ford ordered the wording changed from“Kennedy was shot in the back” to “a shot through the throat.”The Commission, well aware of the ever-nearing November presidential election,reportedly received intense pressure from Johnson aide McGeorge Bundy to hurryup and publish its findings.On September 4, galley proofs of the final report draft were circulated amongcommissioners and staffers for last-minute comments. Two days later, adissatisfied Liebeler submitted a twenty-six-page memorandum highly critical ofthe “Identity of the Assassin” chapter. It had to be revised again.On September 7, commissioners Richard Russell, John Cooper, and Hale Boggs,still unsatisfied with the inevitable conclusion of Oswald’s guilt, traveled toDallas to reexamine Marina Oswald. Under questioning, she changed significantaspects of her story, prompting even more rewriting of the report.The final Warren Commission session was on September 18, 1964, less than tendays before its final report would be issued to President Lyndon Johnson.According to the National Archives, no transcripts of this important finalmeeting exist. However, some descriptions of the meeting show that great concernwas being voiced to Chief Counsel Rankin that material within the reportconflicted with its summary and conclusions chapter.On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission’s report was submitted to PresidentJohnson by Chief Justice Warren with the introduction emphasizing itssponsorship:Dear Mr. President,Your Commission to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy onNovember 22, 1963, having completed its assignment in accordance with ExecutiveOrder No. 11130 of November 29, 1963, herewith submits its final report.The report was signed by all seven commissioners, though Senator Russell refusedto sign until the wording regarding the single-bullet theory was softened toindicate the idea was only a probability.Russell’s dissension and skepticism of the report’s conclusions may have beenthe topic of the September 18 meeting for which the transcripts are missing.Russell told researcher Harold Weisberg that several of the commissioners voiceddoubts about the Commission’s conclusions at that meeting and he was “shaken” bythe discovery that the record of these doubts was missing.The Warren Commission Report was made public on September 28, 1964, with thenews media voicing virtually unanimous praise and support for the document.Upon receiving the report from Warren, President Johnson’s only comment was,“It’s heavy.”Today it is intriguing to note that Johnson refused to answer questions from hisown commission. According to Newsweek of August 15, 1966, “A list of questions[concerning the assassination] for him was in fact prepared and submitted toJohnson’s confidant, Abe Fortas. Fortas returned a veto of the idea.” Instead,both Johnson and his wife submitted unsworn statements.Johnson’s action prompted Commission attorney David Belin to comment in lateryears:If we could interrogate Mrs. Kennedy, whose husband has died before her eyes,there is no reason why President Johnson should not be examined in the samemanner as every other witness [since] there was some speculation from abroad,however outlandish, that he might have had some indirect connection with theDallas tragedy.Two months after the Warren Commission Report was released with widespreadpublicity praising its thoroughness and conclusions, twenty-six volumes ofCommission testimony and exhibits were quietly made public. It was only afteryears of diligent study that individual researchers finally were able todocument the gross inconsistencies between these twenty-six volumes of materialand the Commission’s report. And by then they were largely ignored except by afew low-circulation periodicals. No one was in a position to receive new orclarified information regarding the assassination since—having completed itswork on September 28—the Warren Commission had disbanded.Researcher Sylvia Meagher, in Accessories After the Fact, produced a meticulousdissection of the Commission and its conclusions. She stated, “One of the mostreprehensible actions of the Warren Commission is that it disbanded the momentit handed over its Report, leaving no individual or corporate entity to answerlegitimate questions arising from demonstrable misstatements of fact in theReport.”After carefully researching both the activities and the conclusions of theWarren Commission, Meagher—who has never been successfully challenged in herassertions of the Commission’s incompetence—wrote:Study has shown the Report to contain (1) statements of fact which areinaccurate and untrue, in the light of the official Exhibits and objectiveverification; (2) statements for which the citations fail to provideauthentication; (3) misrepresentation of testimony: (4) omission of referencesto testimony inimical to findings in the Report; (5) suppression of findingsfavorable to Oswald; (6) incomplete investigation of suspicious circumstanceswhich remain unexplained; (7) misleading statements resulting from inadequateattention to the contents of Exhibits; (8) failure to obtain testimony fromcrucial witnesses; and (9) assertions which are diametrically opposite to thelogical inferences to be drawn from the relevant testimony or evidence.After reviewing Warren Commission meeting transcripts in the mid-1970s, authorTad Szulc wrote:If the investigation was as inadequate and incompetent as is suggested by theCommission’s own internal documents, once Top Secret and now declassified, it IS[emphasis his] legitimate to question the specific conclusions of the report.The transcripts of the commission’s executive sessions, staff memoranda . . .and other internal documents reveal the commissioners to be consumed by doubtsand fears; troubled by their own ignorance; suspicious of the investigatory workperformed for them by the FBI and the CIA; lacking clear direction; worriedabout a competing inquiry in Texas; and finally suffering from a stunning lackof confidence in their own ability to produce a report that would be credible tothe American people, the world, and, for that matter, credible to themselves. .. . So many of [their] doubts apparently were not resolved that the impressionemerges from the private discussions among the commissioners that, in the end,the Report was the only possible compromise they could produce—in terms of theirknowledge and their conscience.In the years following the release of the Warren Report, condemnation of itswork and conclusions has only grown more widespread.In 1976, the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respectto Intelligence Activities, while claiming not to have found evidence of aconspiracy to kill Kennedy, nevertheless concluded:The committee has . . . developed evidence which impeaches the process by whichthe intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about theassassination, and by which they provided information to the Warren Commission.This evidence indicates that the investigation of the assassination wasdeficient and that facts which might have substantially affected the course ofthe investigation were not provided the Warren Commission. . . . Why seniorofficials of the FBI and the CIA permitted the investigation to go forward, inlight of these deficiencies, and why they permitted the Warren Commission toreach its conclusions without all relevant information is still unclear.Certainly, concern with public reputation, problems of coordination betweenagencies, possible bureaucratic failure, and embarrassment and the extremecompartmentation of knowledge of sensitive operations may have contributed tothese shortcomings. But the possibility exists that senior officials in bothagencies made conscious decisions not to disclose potentially importantinformation.As has been demonstrated, in most cases, “potentially important information”meant any information that did not add to the evidence of Oswald’s guilt.The sins of the Warren Commission, the FBI, and the CIA go far beyond simpleomission for face-saving purposes.Senator Richard Schweiker, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee’ssubcommittee that looked at the agencies’ performance during the WarrenCommission investigation, told news reporters in 1976 that both the CIA and theFBI deliberately lied to the Commission about significant assassination issues.His charge was supported by former Texas attorney general Waggoner Carr, whoseown investigation was usurped by the Warren Commission. Carr told the HoustonChronicle in 1975, “All of the records were in the hands of the two agencies[the FBI and CIA] and, if they so desired, any information or files could havebeen destroyed or laundered prior to the time the Commission could get them.”Schweiker added that lies from these agencies, coupled with the numerousdeficiencies his panel saw, invalidated the Warren Commission’s conclusions. Hebluntly reported, “I think the Warren Commission has, in fact, collapsed like ahouse of cards. And I believe the Warren Commission was set up at the time tofeed pabulum to the American people for reasons not yet known, and that one ofthe biggest cover-ups in the history of our country occurred at that time.”Widespread disbelief in the Warren Commission, though never publiclyacknowledged, has carried forward right up until today. In January 2013, RobertF. Kennedy Jr., nephew of JFK and son of assassinated senator Robert Kennedy,told the Associated Press his father thought the Commission’s work was a “shoddypiece of craftsmanship.” He said his father “publicly supported the WarrenCommission report but privately he was dismissive of it. . . . The evidence atthis point I think is very, very convincing that it was not a lone gunman.”Today it can be clearly seen that the sins of the Commission includedinvestigating from a preconceived idea, failing to substantiate evidence fromthe FBI, intimidating selected witnesses, stifling internal dissent, andmisreporting its own information. These methods were actively employed tosubvert a truthful investigation and to present flawed and inadequateconclusions to the unsuspecting public. In retrospect, it seems the WarrenCommission provided a classic example of how not to conduct a meaningfulinvestigation.It appears the Commission slowly became aware of the massive power behind theassassination and simply could not—or would not—come to grips with it. Likesubsequent inquiries into the Kennedy assassination, it released a slanted andtimid version of the tragedy hoping to appease the public long enough thatcommissioners would not have to face the full ramifications of a truthful andincisive investigation. And their plan worked well.For more than five decades much of the American public has been content with thepalatable—but implausible—Warren Commission version of the assassination. Today,with firm evidence of a second assassin available and a continuing history ofgovernment deceit, a large number of citizens have reevaluated the officialgovernment assassination theory of a lone gunman. Today, national polls indicatethe vast majority of Americans continue to doubt the basic tenets of the WarrenCommission.A 2004 FOX News poll conducted by Opinion Dynamics Corp. on the fortiethanniversary of the JFK assassination showed 74 percent of respondents believedthere was a conspiracy and a cover-up involved. This poll reflected numberssimilar to previous surveys conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in 1967,1975, and 1981, when about two-thirds also felt the shooting was part of alarger conspiracy."},{"pageContent":"The Garrison Investigation [Contents.html#rch16]On the afternoon of November 22, 1963, two men sat drinking in the KatzenjammerBar, located in New Orleans next door to 544 Camp Street, where a puzzlingparade of anti-Castro Cubans and intelligence agents—including Lee HarveyOswald—had been seen the previous summer.One of the men was Guy Banister, the former FBI man who was running aprivate-investigation firm with intelligence connections out of an office at 544Camp Street. The other man was one of his investigators, Jack Martin.According to a police report prepared that day, the two men returned toBanister’s office, where an argument erupted. Banister, his irritabilityinflamed by alcohol, accused Martin of stealing files, whereupon Martin remindedBanister that he had not forgotten some of the people he had seen in Banister’soffice that summer. Banister then beat Martin over the head with a heavy .357Magnum pistol.In the heat of the moment, Martin screamed out, “What are you going to do—killme, like you all did Kennedy?”A police ambulance was called and carried the bloodied Martin to CharityHospital.An angered Martin soon whispered to friends that Banister had often been in thecompany of a man named David Ferrie, who Martin claimed drove to Texas the dayof Kennedy’s assassination to serve as a getaway pilot for the assassins.Martin’s words soon reached the ears of New Orleans district attorney JimGarrison, who arrested Ferrie upon his return to New Orleans, thus beginning aninvestigation into the JFK assassination that eventually turned into a worldwidecause célèbre.Through Garrison’s investigation much new assassination information became knownto the public and the assassination was addressed for the first time in acourtroom—even though the defendant was acquitted.Garrison claimed that the entire weight of the federal government was moved toblock and ridicule his investigation, and indeed there were many strange aspectsto this entire episode, including an attack by some in the national media beforeGarrison even had a chance to present his case.A giant of a man, standing six-foot-six, Earling Carothers Garrison hadshortened his name to simply “Jim” and was widely known to both friend and foeas the “Jolly Green Giant.”Born on November 20, 1921, in Knoxville, Iowa, Garrison grew up in New Orleansand enlisted in the US Army a year before Pearl Harbor. In 1942, he wascommissioned a lieutenant in the field artillery.After the war, Garrison followed a family tradition in law by enrolling in theTulane University Law School. He eventually earned bachelor of laws and masterof civil laws degrees.Garrison then joined the FBI, serving briefly in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington.He wrote, “I was very impressed with the competence and efficiency of theBureau. However, I was extremely bored as I rang doorbells to inquire about theloyalty and associations of applicants for employment in a defense plant. So Idecided to return to the law profession.”He served as an assistant district attorney in New Orleans from 1954 to 1958,resigning with a scathing attack on mayor Victor H. Schiro. In 1961, Garrisondecided to run for the district attorney’s job, again blasting Schiro forcorruption and failure to enforce the law. His attacks included incumbentdistrict attorney Richard Dowling, whom he called “the great emancipator—he leteveryone go free.”Not believing he had much of a chance, Garrison ran a meager campaign, composedmostly of some television talks. To many people’s surprise, Garrison managed todefeat Dowling in a run-off election, and he took office as district attorney onMarch 3, 1962.Although Garrison did begin to clean up some of the more disreputable gamblingand prostitution dens of New Orleans, his critics noted that he did not sharethat same enthusiasm against the leaders of organized crime.In 1962, Garrison was angered by the refusal of eight criminal-court judges toapprove funds for investigating organized crime. He went so far as to publiclystate that their refusal “raised interesting questions about racketeerinfluences.” The judges sued him for defamation of character and won a $1,000state court judgment. Garrison, however, fought this action all the way to theSupreme Court, which reversed the decision in a landmark case on the right tocriticize public officials.After hearing Jack Martin’s remarks during the assassination weekend, Garrisonattempted to locate David Ferrie. On Monday, November 25, Ferrie turned himselfin.Garrison, who had met the bizarre Ferrie once before, could hardly forget theman. Ferrie suffered from alopecia, a rare disease that causes total baldness.Garrison recalled, “The face grinning ferociously at me was like a ghoulishHalloween mask. The eyebrows plainly were greasepaint, one noticeably higherthan the other. A scruffy, reddish homemade wig hung askew on his head as hefixed me with his eyes.”Ill at ease, Ferrie admitted his Friday trip to Texas, claiming he had wanted togo ice skating in Houston. However, he had no adequate answer for why he hadchosen to drive through one of the worst thunderstorms in years and why, insteadof skating, he had spent his time at the rink’s pay phone. Ferrie also deniedknowing Lee Harvey Oswald.Garrison was unsatisfied with Ferrie’s story. He ordered him and two friendsheld in jail for questioning by the FBI. He later told interviewer Eric Norden,“When we alerted the FBI, they expressed interest and asked us to turn the threemen over to them for questioning. We did, but Ferrie was released soon afterwardand most of [the FBI] report on him was classified top secret and secreted inthe National Archives.”In his 1988 book, On the Trail of the Assassins, Garrison wrote:I was 43 years old and had been district attorney for a year and nine monthswhen John Kennedy was killed. I was an old-fashioned patriot, a product of myfamily, my military experience, and my years in the legal profession. I couldnot imagine then that the government ever would deceive the citizens of thiscountry. Accordingly, when the FBI released David Ferrie with surprisingswiftness, implying that no evidence had been found connecting him with theassassination, I accepted it.Over the next three years, Garrison’s attention was centered on his job andfamily. Vaguely aware of contradictions in the assassination story, Garrisonnevertheless chose to believe the official version. He wrote:By this time [1966] our military was deeply engaged in the war in SoutheastAsia. Like most Americans, I took it for granted that our government had ourtroops over there to bring democracy to South Vietnam. Like most Americans, Ialso took for granted that our government had fully investigated PresidentKennedy’s assassination and had found it to be indeed the result of a random actby a man acting alone. Certainly, it never crossed my mind that the murder ofPresident Kennedy and the subsequent arrival of half a million members of theAmerican military in Vietnam might be related.Garrison’s view began to change after a chance meeting with the powerful senatorfrom Louisiana, Russell Long. Garrison said Long told him, “Those fellows on theWarren Commission were dead wrong. There’s no way in the world that one mancould have shot up John Kennedy that way.”It was a comment that was to put Garrison and his office back on theassassination investigation trail. First Garrison went back and studied theWarren Commission Report and volumes in detail. He was aghast, noting:Considering the lofty credentials of the commission members and the quality andsize of the staff available to them, I had expected to find a thorough andprofessional investigation. I found nothing of the sort. The mass of informationwas disorganized and confused. The commission had provided no adequate index toits exhibits. . . . The number of promising leads that were never followed upoffended my prosecutorial sensibility. And, perhaps worst of all, theconclusions in the report seemed to be based on an appallingly selective readingof the evidence, ignoring credible testimony from literally dozens of witnesses.Garrison, with his military background, was particularly shocked to read in thecommission volumes where a Lieutenant Colonel Allison G. Folsom Jr. reported ona grade made by Oswald in a Russian examination. Garrison knew that the merefact that Oswald had been tested in Russian indicated intelligence training.Fired by growing suspicions, Garrison took another look at Oswald’s activitieswhile in New Orleans in the spring and summer of 1963. He began to discover theodd and mostly unexplained relationships between Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans,US intelligence agents including the FBI, and 544 Camp Street.Quietly he began to assemble some of his most trusted assistants, whom he dubbedhis “special team,” and his investigation grew.Garrison reinterviewed Jack Martin and found that Oswald had been part of thatstrange entourage of agents in and out of Banister’s Camp Street office. Hefound that Banister and his associates were involved in activities far afieldfrom normal New Orleans activity, honest or otherwise. There were tales ofburglarized armories, missing weapons, raided ammunition caches, and gunrunningoperations. Garrison wrote, “The Banister apparatus . . . was part of a supplyline that ran along the Dallas–New Orleans–Miami corridor. These suppliesconsisted of arms and explosives for use against Castro’s Cuba.”By 1966, Banister was dead—he reportedly suffered a heart attack in June1964—and Garrison was looking for a living person to prosecute in the conspiracyhe had begun to unravel.One starting point was New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews, who told the WarrenCommission that he had received a call from a “Clay Bertrand” the day after theassassination asking him to fly to Dallas and legally represent Lee HarveyOswald. Andrews reiterated this story to Garrison and claimed that while he had“Clay Bertrand” as a client, he had never actually met the man.As Garrison’s investigators pried into the seamier areas of New Orleansnightlife, they began to piece together information from various sources that itwas common knowledge in the homosexual underground that “Clay Bertrand” was thename used by none other than Clay Shaw, the respected director of theInternational Trade Mart in New Orleans.Clay Shaw and Permindex [Contents.html#rsec88]Clay Shaw, like Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby, was not merely some innocentwith no connection to persons and/or organizations that may have played a rolein President Kennedy’s death.Shaw had some of the most intriguing and unprobed connections of any personinvolved in the assassination case. Even when some of these connections werebrought to the attention of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, thecommittee was either unable or unwilling to fully investigate them.Shaw, a tall, distinguished man with silver hair and a polished manner, was bornin Kentwood, Louisiana, on March 17, 1913. During the 1930s, Shaw was in NewYork City working as an executive for Western Union Telegraph Company and lateras an advertising and public-relations consultant.Once again, there is a military connection. In 1941, Shaw was with the US Armyand, while his official biography states simply that he was an aide-de-camp toGeneral Charles O. Thrasher, Shaw later admitted he was working for the Officeof Strategic Services (OSS) as a liaison officer to the headquarters of WinstonChurchill. It was here that Shaw may have become entangled in the murky world ofintelligence.Although there is precious little reliable information on exactly what Shaw’swartime experiences included, he did retire from the US Army in 1946 as a major;later he was made a colonel, with the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, France’sCroix de Guerre, and Belgium’s Order of the Crown.After the war, Shaw returned to New Orleans, where he was known as a wealthyreal-estate developer. He also became director of the International House, a“nonprofit association fostering the development of international trade, tourismand cultural exchange.” Soon Shaw left this organization to found theInternational Trade Mart, which became quite profitable sponsoring permanentindustrial expositions in the Caribbean.According to several separate sources, including Garrison’s files and aninvestigation by the US Labor Party, a short-lived political party that offeredLyndon LaRouche as a presidential candidate in 1976, Shaw’s International TradeMart was a subsidiary of a shadowy entity known as the Centro MondialeCommerciale (World Trade Center), which was founded in Montreal, Canada, in thelate 1950s, then moved to Rome in 1961.The Trade Mart was connected with Centro Mondiale Commerciale (CMC) through yetanother shadowy firm named Permindex (PERManent INDustrial EXpositions), also inthe business of international expositions.It is fascinating to note that in the 1962 edition of Who’s Who in the South andSouthwest, Shaw gave biographical information stating that he was on the boardof directors of Permindex. However, in the 1963–1964 edition, the reference toPermindex was dropped.In the late 1960s, both Permindex and its parent company, Centro MondialeCommerciale, came under intense scrutiny by the Italian news media. It wasdiscovered that on the board of CMC was Prince Gutierrez di Spadaforo, a wealthyaristocrat who had been undersecretary of agriculture under the dictator BenitoMussolini and whose daughter-in-law was related to Nazi minister of financeHjalmar Schacht; Carlo D’Amelio, an attorney for the former Italian royalfamily; and Ferenc Nagy, former premier of Hungary and a leading anticommunist.The Italian media reported that Nagy was president of Permindex and the boardchairman and major stockholder was Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, a powerfulMontreal lawyer who represented the Bronfmans, a Canadian family made wealthy bythe liquor industry, as well as serving US intelligence services. ReportedlyBloomfield established Permindex in 1958 as part of the creation of worldwidetrade centers connected with CMC.According to a special report by investigative reporters David Goldman andJeffrey Steinberg in 1981, Bloomfield was recruited into the British SpecialOperations Executive in 1938, during the war was given rank within the US Army,and eventually became part of the OSS intelligence system, including the FBI’sDivision Five, reportedly a small unit within the bureau dealing withcounterespionage. According to this report, Bloomfield became quite close withJ. Edgar Hoover.Permindex began to draw attention in 1962, when French president Charles deGaulle publicly accused the company of channeling funds to the outlawed SecretArmy Organization (OAS), which had made several attempts on de Gaulle’s life. DeGaulle identified several major and well-known international companies asinvestors in Permindex.In tracing the money used to finance the assassination plots against de Gaulle,French intelligence discovered that some $200,000 in secret funds had been sentto Permindex accounts in the Banque de la Credit Internationale.For years researchers have been intrigued by information Jim Garrison gatheredearly in his investigation: that in 1962 Guy Banister had dispatched anassociate, Maurice Brooks Gatlin—the legal counsel to Banister’s anticommunistLeague of the Caribbean—to Paris with a suitcase full of cash for the OAS,reportedly about $200,000.As Garrison began to probe this area of interest, he discovered that Gatlin hadbeen killed when he fell or was thrown from the sixth-floor window of a hotel inPanama.To further complicate this maze of business, finance, European money, holdoverNazis, and intelligence agents, various investigators—including some from Lifemagazine—found that some of the banking connections from this secret empirereached to Mafia chief Meyer Lansky and his gambling operations in the Bahamas.Whatever the truth behind Centro Mondiale Commerciale and its companion company,Permindex, the Italian government saw fit to expel both in 1962 for subversiveactivities connected to those in the much-publicized Propaganda-2 Masonic Lodgescandal of more recent years in Italy in which the lodge was accused ofattempting to overthrow the Italian government and set up a fascist regime.The news media in France, Italy, and Canada had a field day tying the twodiscredited firms to the CIA. And there is now evidence that Shaw indeed wasconnected to the CIA. Victor Marchetti, former executive assistant to the deputydirector of the CIA and author of The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, hasrevealed that in early 1969, he learned from CIA director Richard Helms thatboth Clay Shaw and David Ferrie had worked for the agency.Marchetti said Helms repeatedly voiced concern over the prosecution of Shaw andeven instructed top aides “to do all we can to help Shaw.” Further, a CIA memodated September 28, 1967, to the Justice Department, finally made public in1977, revealed that Shaw had provided the agency with some thirty reportsbetween 1949 and 1956.It may also be pertinent that in May 1961, just after the disastrous Bay of PigsInvasion, Shaw introduced CIA deputy director General Charles P. Cabell to theForeign Policy Association of New Orleans.[images/line.jpg]By late 1966, Garrison had two suspects in mind in the murder of PresidentKennedy—the strange David Ferrie and the socially connected Clay Shaw.David William Ferrie was a character straight out of some fiction novel, but hewas frighteningly real. With his painted eyebrows and reddish wig, Ferrie lookedlike a clown. Yet he was an aggressive homosexual with an appetite for youngboys. Ferrie considered himself a master hypnotist, a philosopher, apsychologist, a scientist, a cancer researcher, and a religious “bishop” in theOrthodox Old Catholic Church of North America.Cashiered as a pilot for Eastern Airlines following publicity over a homosexualarrest, Ferrie continued his flying activities, which included work for both theCIA and reputed New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello.Ferrie also was closely connected to anti-Castro Cubans. In 1961, Ferrie oftenwas seen in the company of Sergio Archaca-Smith, New Orleans director of thevirulently anti-Castro Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front.That same year, Ferrie was introduced to a meeting of the New Orleans Civic Clubas one of the pilots involved in the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion. There,Ferrie made a bitterly anti-Kennedy talk. He also made an anti-Kennedy talk tothe New Orleans chapter of the Military Order of World Wars in which he saidKennedy “double-crossed” the invasion force by failing to authorize needed airsupport. Ferrie’s speech was so vitriolic that several members of the audiencewalked out.As Garrison continued his investigation, he found abundant evidence that Ferrie,who had been in contact with Oswald, also was connected to Clay Shaw.Raymond Broshears, a longtime friend of Ferrie’s, had seen Ferrie and Shawtogether on several occasions. Furthermore, Broshears told Garrison how Ferrieonce became intoxicated and detailed how he had driven to Houston the day ofKennedy’s death to meet two members of the assassination team from Dallas. Thepair was to have arrived in Houston in an airplane piloted by one of them, aCuban exile known only as “Carlos.” Ferrie was to have taken Carlos and hisfellow assassin out of Houston. Ferrie told Broshears that something had gonewrong. The two men never showed up.Whether or not the Broshears account of Ferrie’s comments is accurate, Garrisonsoon found others who had known of the relationship between Ferrie and Shaw.Jules Ricco Kimble, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, told Garrison of beingintroduced to Shaw by Ferrie, as did a Ferrie acquaintance named David Logan.Nicholas Tadin, the head of the New Orleans musicians’ union, told Garrison thathe and his wife had sought out Ferrie for flying lessons when they saw Ferrieand Shaw together at New Orleans Airport.As Garrison’s investigation broadened to include trips to Dallas, Houston, andMiami by members of his team, the secrecy surrounding his probe began tocrumble. On February 17, 1967, the dam broke when the New Orleans States-Itempublished a story on Garrison’s activities with the headline: DA HERE LAUNCHESFULL JFK DEATH PLOT PROBE. The story noted that the district attorney’s officehad spent more than $8,000 in travel and “investigative expenses.” Counteringthe charge that he was simply seeking publicity, Garrison later wrote, “We hadoperated as secretly as possible, assuming this was the most efficient andresponsible way to handle such a potentially explosive situation. However, thevoucher requests were public records, so they could not legally be concealed.”The local news story brought a deluge of media attention from across the nation.Reporters began arriving in New Orleans. The next day, Garrison was forced tocome out in the open, announcing, “We have been investigating the role of theCity of New Orleans in the assassination of President Kennedy, and we have madesome progress—I think substantial progress. . . . What’s more, there will bearrests.”Also arriving in the city were some odd characters who would add to the carnivalatmosphere that was beginning to take shape. One was a self-styled Denver oilmanwho told Garrison he could “guarantee” him a federal judgeship if he would drophis investigation into the president’s death. Garrison showed him the door.Not long after this attempt at bribery a more sinister plan came to light. Aprofessional criminal from Philadelphia named Edward Whalen came to Garrison andsaid he had been approached by David Ferrie with a proposal to kill Garrison for$25,000. When Whalen declined the offer, he said, Ferrie took him to Clay Shaw’sapartment, where both men tried to persuade him to carry out the assassinationof Garrison. This time Whalen not only was offered money but was told that if hedid the job there would be top medical care and a college education for hisdaughter, who suffered from polio.Ferrie even went so far as to claim he had helped set up the JFK assassinationand told Whalen that Lee Oswald was a CIA agent who had been well taken care ofuntil he made some mistakes that necessitated his death. Whalen believedFerrie’s story to be unfounded boasts, and he again declined the murdercontract.By the time Whalen revealed this plot to Garrison in September 1967, it was toolate to verify it. On February 22, 1967, less than a week after the newspapersbroke the story of Garrison’s investigation, his chief suspect, David Ferrie,was found dead in his cluttered apartment.His death was not entirely unexpected by Garrison. The day the newspaper storyfirst ran, Ferrie had telephoned Garrison aide Lou Ivon to say, “You know whatthis news story does to me, don’t you? I’m a dead man. From here on, believe me,I’m a dead man.”Ferrie’s nude body had been discovered lying on a living-room sofa surrounded byprescription medicine bottles, several completely empty. One typed suicide notewas found on a nearby table while a second was discovered on an upright piano.Three days later the New Orleans coroner ruled that Ferrie had died from“natural causes,” specifically a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.Unconvinced, Garrison checked the empty medicine bottles found near Ferrie’sbody and discovered one had contained a drug designed to greatly increase aperson’s metabolism.It is known that Ferrie suffered from hypertension. A physician friend confirmedto Garrison that if someone suffering from hypertension took a whole bottle ofthis specific drug, it would cause death very quickly. Garrison later wrote, “Iphoned immediately but was told that no blood samples or spinal fluid fromFerrie’s autopsy had been retained. I was left with an empty bottle and a numberof unanswered questions.” Garrison also was left without the man he laterdescribed as “one of history’s most important individuals.”And Ferrie was not the only person connected to the case to die. Banisterreportedly died of a heart attack in June 1964, less than a month after hisbusiness partner, Hugh Ward—an investigator who had worked closely withFerrie—died in a Mexico plane crash that also took the life of New Orleans mayorDeLesseps Morrison.Yet another man closely connected to Ferrie was Eladio del Valle, a wealthyformer Cuban congressman under Batista who had fled Cuba to become a well-knownorganizer of anti-Castro Cubans in Miami. Del Valle reportedly had paid Ferrie$1,500 a mission to make air raids against Cuba.Three days before Ferrie’s death, Garrison’s investigators began trying tolocate del Valle. Just twelve hours after Ferrie’s death, del Valle’s mutilatedbody was discovered in a Miami parking lot. Police reported that del Valle hadbeen tortured and shot in the heart at point-blank range, and his skull splitopen with an ax. His murder has never been solved.With Ferrie and del Valle dead, Garrison began to focus his attention on ClayShaw. Fearing that Shaw might meet the same fate as Ferrie, Garrison movedrapidly. He and his “special team” had Shaw arrested on March 1, 1967.Loud and long, Shaw protested his innocence, stating flatly, “I never heard ofany plot and I never used any alias in my life.”The question of an alias came up as Shaw was being booked into jail. A policeofficer filling out forms asked Shaw if he had any aliases. Shaw calmly replied,“Clay Bertrand,” thus confirming the information that Garrison had beenreceiving from various sources around New Orleans. The officer duly noted thisalias on his form.Between the time of his arrest and his trial, Shaw was allowed to go free afterposting a $10,000 bail bond.As Garrison’s men searched Shaw’s house they found several interesting items,such as two large hooks screwed into the ceiling of Shaw’s bedroom along withfive whips, several lengths of chain, and a black hood and cape. Shaw tried toshrug off this kinky collection as simply part of a Mardi Gras costume.Harder to shrug off was Shaw’s personal address book, which contained the namesof important persons in Italy, Paris, and London.But most intriguing was a listing for “Lee Odum, P.O. Box 19106, Dallas, Texas.”What made this so intriguing was that the address “P.O. 19106” also appears inLee Harvey Oswald’s address book.Garrison announced that “P.O. 19106” actually was a code for Jack Ruby’sunlisted Dallas telephone number and noted that the number was in the addressbooks of both Shaw and Oswald.Interest in this issue dissipated rapidly following a May 17, 1967, story in theDallas Times Herald revealing that Lee Odum was a real person living in Dallas.Odum, then thirty-one, told the newspaper that he had traveled to New Orleans in1966 to promote a bullfight and had been sent to Shaw as a businessman who mightbe interested in his scheme. He said he gave Shaw the P.O. box number, which hadbeen rented in the name of a barbecue company he operated at the time.This seemed to clear up the issue, except that the Times Herald noted that P.O.Box 19106 did not exist until 1965, when the post office substation involved wasremodeled. Therefore, it remains to be explained why that particular box numberappeared in Oswald’s address book in 1963 and to what it truly pertained.To further titillate Garrison’s interest, he found on an unused page of Shaw’saddress book the words “Oct” and “Nov” and, following an indecipherablescribble, the name “Dallas.”After Shaw’s arrest, the US government “awakened like an angry lion,” accordingto Garrison.Attorney general Ramsey Clark told news reporters that Shaw had been checked outand cleared of any responsibility in the Kennedy assassination. But since Shaw’sname had never before come up in connection with the assassination, questionsarose over who in the federal government had investigated Shaw and why. Quicklya Justice Department spokesman tried to backpedal for Clark by issuing thisstatement: “The attorney general has since determined that this [report ofShaw’s investigation] was erroneous. Nothing arose indicating a need toinvestigate Mr. Shaw.”This explanation was further clouded when a Justice Department official tried toexplain that the department had been aware that Clay Shaw and Clay Bertrand werethe same man and that the FBI had investigated a Clay Bertrand.Despite the federal government’s protest that Garrison was on a “witch hunt,”when his evidence was presented to a New Orleans grand jury, a true bill wasreturned. Clay Shaw was indicted on a charge that he “did willfully andunlawfully conspire with David W. Ferrie, herein named but not charged, and LeeHarvey Oswald, herein named but not charged, and others, not herein named, tomurder John F. Kennedy.”To assure the public that he was doing only his sworn duty, Garrison even tookthe unprecedented step of having himself—the prosecutor—file for a preliminaryhearing for Shaw. This hearing, usually the providence of the defense, tookplace on March 14, 1967, before three judges, who reviewed Garrison’s evidence.After studying Garrison’s case for three days, the three-judge panel upheld theindictment and ordered Shaw to a jury trial.For the next year and a half, as the world waited for Garrison’s case to bepresented at Shaw’s trial, the major US news media lambasted the events in NewOrleans. Garrison later wrote:Some long-cherished illusions of mine about the great free press in our countryunderwent a painful reappraisal during this period. The restraint and respectfor justice one might expect from the press to insure a fair trial not only tothe individual charged but to the state itself did not exist. Nor did thediversity of opinion that I always thought was fundamental to the Americanpress. As far as I could tell, the reports and editorials in Newsweek, Time, TheNew York Times, the New York Post, The Saturday Evening Post, and on and on wereindistinguishable. All shared the basic view that I was a power-mad,irresponsible showman who was producing a slimy circus with the objective ofgetting elected to higher office, oblivious to any consequences.Garrison also commented on further efforts to give Shaw every consideration:In this particular case, I’ve taken unusual steps to protect the rights of thedefendant and assure him a fair trial. Before we introduced the testimony of ourwitnesses, we made them undergo independent verifying tests, including polygraphexamination, truth serum, and hypnosis. We thought this would be hailed as anunprecedented step in jurisprudence. Instead, the press turned around and hintedthat we had drugged our witnesses or given them posthypnotic suggestions totestify falsely.This comment might have been aimed at James Phelan, a writer for the SaturdayEvening Post who, after hearing Garrison’s account of his evidence, reportedthat Garrison’s key witness, Perry Russo, came up with his story of aFerrie-Oswald-Shaw conspiracy only after being “drugged” and hypnotized byGarrison’s people.Phelan’s account has been accepted by some researchers who failed to note thatRusso told the press of the conspiracy meeting well before undergoing hypnosis.In fact, when Phelan appeared as a defense witness for Shaw, Russo soundlydisputed his claims, though Russo’s conviction that Shaw was the man at themeeting appeared to weaken.Particularly galling to Garrison was an account by Hugh Aynesworth, then workingfor Newsweek, claiming Garrison had offered an unwilling witness $3,000 and anairline job to testify in the upcoming trial. The story added that the entirebribery attempt had been tape-recorded.Aynesworth was a writer for the Dallas Morning News the day of the assassinationand was at the scene of each important event. In 1988, Aynesworth wroteextensively for a special edition of the Washington Times commemorating thetwenty-fifth anniversary of the assassination. While admitting “flaws” in theWarren Commission investigation, he nevertheless supported its conclusions bywriting, “That report has been proven to have been considerably more honest,more objective and of far greater depth than any subsequent ‘probe’ or‘inquiry.’”When asked to provide evidence of Garrison’s bribery attempt, Aynesworth failedto present either a witness or the tape recording he had mentioned. Internal CIAdocuments later made public showed Aynesworth, then working as a reporter forthe Dallas Morning News, offered his services to the agency prior to theassassination and later was considered “a Warren Commission man on theassassination.” As late as 2012, Aynesworth was still being given much space inthe Dallas Morning News to attack “conspiracy theorists.”During the Shaw trial, the media made much out of a visit to Las Vegas byGarrison, where reportedly he received a $5,000 credit line at the Sands Hotel.In 1979, a report to the House Select Committee on Assassinations even statedthat Garrison met with mobster Johnny Roselli less than a month after Ferrie’sdeath.For his part, Garrison wrote to researcher John Judge, retorting, “I have nevereven seen John Roselli in my life; nor have I ever had a ‘secret meeting’ withany racketeer anywhere.”An NBC program stated that one of Garrison’s witnesses had lied under oath, butwhen requested to present their evidence to a New Orleans grand jury, newsexecutives declined. In that same NBC program, newsman Frank McGee claimed twoof Garrison’s star witnesses had failed their polygraph tests. Garrison publiclyoffered to resign if the network could substantiate this charge. Again, no proofwas forthcoming.CBS interviewed Garrison, but as he later reported, “When the CBS program wasshown across the nation, my half hour had been reduced to approximately 30seconds. This gave me just about enough time to be a discordant bleep in thenetwork’s massive four-hour tribute to the Warren Commission.”Shortly before Clay Shaw’s trial, Garrison believed he may have been the objectof a setup to implicate him with a known homosexual and a former client. Heescaped arrest and was shocked to learn that one of his “special team” members,a former FBI man, may have been responsible for the bizarre episode. However,before Garrison could question the man, he hurriedly left New Orleans, takingmany of the district attorney’s files with him. Garrison also claimed thatsomeone had “bugged” the telephones of his office, his home, and even his staff.The anti-Garrison media blitz coupled with the strange incidents surrounding hisinvestigation prompted Garrison to claim that “a tremendous amount of federalpower” had been arrayed against him in an effort to block his investigation ofKennedy’s death.He voiced his concern over a fair trial when he told interviewer Eric Norden,“I’m beginning to worry about the cumulative effect of this propagandablitzkrieg on potential jurors for the trial of Clay Shaw. I don’t know how longthey can withstand the drumbeat obligato of charges exonerating the defendantand convicting the prosecutor.”Garrison claimed this concerted effort to stop his investigation proved twothings: “First, that we were correct when we uncovered the involvement of theCIA in the assassination; second, that there is something very wrong today withour government in Washington, D.C., inasmuch as it is willing to use massiveeconomic power to conceal the truth from the people.”But Garrison was not without supporters. A group of New Orleans businessmen,going under the name “Truth or Consequences,” gave Garrison both moral andfinancial backing.Surprising solidarity came from Boston’s Cardinal Richard Cushing, fatherconfessor to the Kennedy family, who commented, “I think they [the investigationin New Orleans] should follow it through. . . . I never believed theassassination was the work of one man.”Another odd show of support for Garrison came years later from a most unlikelysource. Shortly before his disappearance, Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa stated, “JimGarrison’s a smart man . . . goddamned smart attorney. . . . Anybody thinks he’sa kook is a kook themselves.”There is some evidence that Robert Kennedy also took Garrison’s probe seriously.He indicated to his friend Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. that he believed Garrisonmight be onto something. But once when his staff began to tell him aboutGarrison’s findings, he turned away, saying, “Well, I don’t think I want toknow.”By January 29, 1969, the day the Clay Shaw trial finally got under way,Garrison’s case was already foundering. His chief suspect, Ferrie, was dead andothers had fled New Orleans and were safe in other states that refused to honorGarrison’s legal extradition requests.Governor John Connally, himself a victim in Dallas, refused to extradite Cubanleader Sergio Archaca-Smith, while California governor Ronald Reagan declined toallow extradition for one Edgar Eugene Bradley. Garrison, in a mistake thatwould cost him further credibility, apparently had mistaken Bradley for Mafiaman Eugene Hale Brading, who was arrested in Dealey Plaza shortly after theassassination.But Garrison’s major “missing witness” was Gordon Novel, then a youngelectronics expert who eventually became embroiled in some of this nation’s mostcontroversial cases. Novel first approached Garrison in early 1967 withinformation about David Ferrie and Cuban exile activities, but soon Garrisoncame to believe that Novel was a CIA “plant.” Some researchers also identifiedNovel as the “umbrella man” in Dealey Plaza but his claim to have been in NewYork City at the time and the fact that he lived until his seventy-fourth yearbelied that notion.After Garrison subpoenaed Novel, he fled to Ohio, where governor James Rhodes,despite a personal call from Louisiana governor John McKeithen, refused to allowextradition. Likewise, the governor of Nebraska declined to honor an extraditionorder for Sandra Moffett, a former girlfriend of Perry Russo’s who was presentat the gathering of Ferrie, Shaw, and Oswald in September 1963.A note left behind in his New Orleans apartment, which was later authenticatedas being written by Novel, mentioned his work for Double Check Corporation, aCIA “front” located in Miami. The letter stated, “Our connection and activity ofthat period [with Double Check] involves individuals presently . . . about to beindicted as conspirators in Mr. Garrison’s investigation.”In 1974 Novel, who later in life claimed to have worked with the CIA, thoughnever as an employee, met with President Nixon’s special counsel Charles Colsonand discussed developing a special degaussing machine that would erase Nixon’sincriminating White House tapes from afar. Novel also cropped up as anelectronics expert in the case of automobile magnate John DeLorean and again asan imaging expert in the court trial of Waco’s Branch Davidians. Novel died inOctober 2012.Despite the media attacks and missing witnesses, Garrison gamely moved aheadwith his prosecution of Clay Shaw. His goals were twofold: (1) convince the jurythat a conspiracy was behind President Kennedy’s death, and (2) prove that ClayShaw was a part of that conspiracy. Garrison achieved the first goal but failedon the second.After a string of witnesses from Dallas—including the Bill Newmans and railroadman James L. Simmons and others not called before the Warren Commission—told ofshots to Kennedy’s front and medical experts pointed out the shortcomings of thepresident’s autopsy, the jury became convinced of Garrison’s charge that aconspiracy had existed. This conviction solidified when the jury viewed theZapruder film of the assassination—made available for the first time thanks toGarrison’s subpoena power. After the trial, the polled jury agreed that Garrisonhad convinced them that Kennedy had died as the result of a conspiracy.However, the evidence of Shaw’s involvement proved less convincing. Despiteseveral credible people who testified they had seen David Ferrie and Lee Oswaldwith a man matching Clay Shaw’s description, including several prominentresidents of Clinton, Louisiana, many jurors remained skeptical.Insurance salesman Perry Russo repeated his 1967 statements that he was presentwhen Shaw and Ferrie talked about assassinating Kennedy. Russo said that Shawwas introduced to him as Clem Bertrand. He said Ferrie and the man he identifiedas Shaw talked of triangulation of gunfire and the need to have alibis at thetime of the assassination.Defense attorneys countered that Russo had been given a truth serum drug to helphis recall and reiterated the charge that Garrison had implanted the entireFerrie-Shaw story while Russo was under the drug’s influence.One particularly compelling witness was Vernon Bundy, who testified he had seenClay Shaw meet with Lee Harvey Oswald at a seawall on Lake Pontchartrain, nearNew Orleans, in June 1963. Bundy said he knew the man speaking with Oswald wasShaw because he noticed the man had a slight limp. A puzzled Shaw was asked towalk down the center aisle of the courtroom and everyone, including an amazedGarrison, noticed for the first time a nearly imperceptible limp.Another credible witness was postman James Hardiman, who testified that during1966 he had delivered letters addressed to “Clay Bertrand” to a forwardingaddress for Clay Shaw. Hardiman said none of the letters were returned.Then came Charles Spiesel, a New York accountant who had suddenly shown up inNew Orleans to tell Garrison that he had met David Ferrie on a visit and thatthey had been joined by Clay Shaw. Appearing to be a credible witness, he hadbeen belatedly added to Garrison’s witness list.Once Spiesel was on the stand, Garrison cringed at the man’s cross-examination.The man rambled on about how he had been hypnotized on several occasions byvarious unidentified people and how he regularly fingerprinted his daughter uponher return from Louisiana State University to make sure she was really hisdaughter.Garrison’s case also was not helped by several statements Spiesel made prior tothe Shaw trial, including the claims that Shaw had met with Ruby and Oswald inthe Jack Tar Capital House in Baton Rouge on September 3, 1963, and handed themmoney, and that the man who killed President Kennedy had fired a .45-caliberpistol, then fled through the Dallas drainage system to another part of town.None of these claims were substantiated.More harm came in the testimony of attorney Dean Andrews, who, while under aperjury charge by Garrison, changed his story of being called by a man namedClay Bertrand and asked to defend Oswald just after the assassination. On thestand, Andrews said the name “Clay Bertrand” was simply a “figment of [his]imagination” and that he had never known Clay Shaw. Andrews’s statementsstrongly affected the jury, although later Garrison convicted Andrews of perjurybased on this testimony.And when assistant district attorney James L. Alcock tried to discreditAndrews’s testimony, it appeared he was impeaching the core of Garrison’sallegation that Shaw and Bertrand were one and the same.So the crux of the case came down to whether Clay Shaw, the respected directorof the International Trade Mart, and Clay (or Clem) Bertrand, the man overheardplotting against Kennedy, were the same man.Garrison’s strongest piece of evidence was Shaw’s jail card, which showed heused the alias Clay Bertrand. Yet Criminal District Court judge Edward AloysiusHaggerty refused to allow the jail card to be introduced as evidence, arguingthat Shaw had not been allowed to have a lawyer with him during the bookingprocedure.Garrison’s hole card became New Orleans policeman Aloysius J. Habighorst, thejailer who filled out Shaw’s admission form, and who was expected to testifythat Shaw had told him his alias was Clay Bertrand. However, before Habighorstcould take the stand, Judge Haggerty ordered the jury removed from thecourtroom. He told stunned prosecutors that he was not allowing Habighorst’stestimony to be admitted because again no attorney had been present and hisalias story appeared to violate Shaw’s rights.Judge Haggerty then said, “Even if [Shaw] did [admit the alias], it is notadmissible. If Officer Habighorst is telling the truth—and I seriously doubt it. . .” This remark brought Assistant District Attorney Alcock to his feet,saying, “Are you passing on the credibility of a state witness in front of thepress and the whole world?” To this Judge Haggerty responded, “It’s outside thepresence of the jury. I do not care. The whole world can hear that I do notbelieve Officer Habighorst. I do not believe Officer Habighorst.”Alcock moved to have a mistrial declared, but Judge Haggerty denied this,ordering the trial to proceed without the crucial testimony of OfficerHabighorst.With the judge’s statements, Garrison’s case, already severely weakened by dead,incredible, and unobtainable witnesses, collapsed.Clay Shaw took the stand in his own defense, claiming that he never knew Ferrie,Oswald, or Ruby and that he had not participated in a plot to kill Kennedy.Garrison’s team was unable to provide any motivation for Shaw’s involvement insuch a scheme.Just past midnight on March 1, 1969—two years to the day that Shaw had firstbeen arrested—the jury filed into Judge Haggerty’s courtroom to announce ClayShaw’s acquittal after less than an hour of deliberation.Two days later, on March 3, Garrison filed perjury charges against Shaw formaintaining that he never met David Ferrie. Garrison later wrote:We had more witnesses to prove this flagrant case of perjury than I had everencountered as district attorney. . . . Given my personal choice, I would muchrather have let the matter rest once and for all. . . . However, the choice wasnot mine. My decision had been made automatically when—contrary to the numerousstatements in our files—Shaw had taken the witness stand and, in his grand andcourtly manner, made a mockery of the law against lying under oath.But again Garrison had not counted on the federal government.According to federal law at the time, “A court of the United States may notgrant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State Court except as expresslyauthorized by an Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”Garrison wrote:Fortunately for Shaw, the federal judicial system shut its eyes to that federallaw. The United States District Court DID [sic] enjoined me from prosecutingShaw for committing perjury, and the federal appellate structure firmly backedup the District Court’s ruling all the way. When the assassination of a deadpresident has been ratified by a live national government, details such as thelaw very quickly become irrelevant.Clay Shaw, his finances depleted after years of defending himself and despondentover the revelations of his homosexual connections, retired to his New Orleanshome, where he died on August 14, 1974.Even Shaw’s death did not pass without question. Neighbors saw some men carryingwhat appeared to be a body completely covered by a sheet on a stretcher into acarriage house belonging to Shaw. They called the coroner’s office, whichdispatched investigators. The coroner’s investigators found Shaw’s home emptyand, after a day of searching, learned that Shaw had just been buried in hishometown of Kentwood. A death certificate signed by a Dr. Hugh Betson stateddeath was caused by lung cancer.New Orleans coroner Dr. Frank Minyard, concerned over the circumstances ofShaw’s death and the rapidity of burial, initially said he would seek a courtorder to exhume Shaw’s body. However, word reached the news media, whichimmediately editorialized against such a move, hinting that the exhumation wasjust another attack by Garrison, and Minyard dropped the whole matter.Despite his courtroom loss and the tidal wave of negative publicity—the New YorkTimes called the case “one of the most disgraceful chapters in the history ofAmerican jurisprudence” while the New Orleans States-Item demanded Garrison’sresignation—the scrappy district attorney nevertheless handily won reelectionlater that year.But his troubles with the federal government were not over. On June 30, 1971,Garrison was arrested at his home by Internal Revenue Service agents who chargedhim with accepting illegal payoffs from pinball-machine operators. After twoyears of more bad publicity, he was finally brought to trial. Severalpinball-machine operators told of making payoffs, but none of them coulddirectly implicate Garrison.Finally, a former Garrison investigator and Army buddy, Pershing Gervais, tookthe stand and told how Garrison had accepted $150,000 in payoffs. He evenproduced a tape recording reportedly made of the district attorney discussingthe matter. But on cross-examination, Gervais admitted that he had told atelevision reporter that the Justice Department had forced him to lie andincriminate Garrison. Gervais had admitted the case against Garrison was “atotal, complete political frame-up, absolutely.” Furthermore, a speech experttestified that the incriminating tape had been created by splicing togetherseveral innocuous comments Garrison had made.Garrison and two codefendants were quickly found not guilty, but enough damagehad been done. Busy defending himself in court, Garrison failed to mount aneffective campaign in 1973 and was defeated for district attorney by 2,000votes.Furthermore, the federal government came at him again, this time alleging incometax evasion in connection with the discredited pinball payoffs. Again Garrisonwas found not guilty, but by this time the national audience had largely turnedits back on the “controversial” lawman in New Orleans.Even today many assassination researchers believe Garrison was far afield oftruth about Kennedy’s death. Many agree with House Select Committee onAssassinations chief counsel Robert Blakey, who bluntly wrote, “In short, theGarrison case was a fraud.”Blakey, who claims organized crime killed Kennedy, apparently fails to see anysuspicious connection in that David Ferrie was with New Orleans mob boss CarlosMarcello in court on the morning of the assassination; that Ferrie was the CivilAir Patrol leader of Lee Harvey Oswald; and that Ferrie and Clay Shaw bothworked for the CIA and were connected to anti-Castro Cubans.It should also be pointed out that critics of Blakey’s work on the Housecommittee noted a cozy relationship between Blakey and government agencies, suchas the FBI and CIA.Buried at the end of the “Principal Sources” section in his book, The Plot toKill the President, Blakey gives evidence of pre-censorship as well as hisrelationship with certain government agencies by writing:Pursuant to agreement with the House Select Committee on Assassinations, theCentral Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation reviewedthis book in manuscript form to determine that classified information itcontained had been properly released for publication and that no informant wasidentified. Neither the CIA nor the FBI warrants the factual material orendorses the views expressed.Another Garrison detractor, author David E. Scheim, who also espouses theMafia-did-it theory, cited the charges against Garrison made by NBC, Newsweek,the New York Times, and the Saturday Evening Post apparently without consideringthat few of their accusations were ever proven.Citing Garrison’s failure to loudly identify Jack Ruby as Mafia-connected,Scheim wrote, “Although Garrison made extravagant charges against an assortmentof Cuban exiles, CIA agents, Minutemen, White Russians, and Nazis, heconspicuously avoided any reference to one prime assassination suspect: theMafia.”Indeed, Garrison’s failure to acknowledge Carlos Marcello and the mob’sactivities in New Orleans has caused many raised eyebrows among researchersotherwise kindly disposed toward the former DA.Scheim claims Garrison’s former investigator Gervais, was a Marcello associateand when Garrison cleaned up Bourbon Street nightspots, he “selectively avoidedthe clubs controlled by Marcello.” The author also expressed the belief thatGarrison’s acquittal in the 1971 payoff case was the result of more bribes.Scheim goes beyond Blakey by stating that Garrison’s activities in New Orleanshad a sinister design, writing: “The purpose of the Garrison assassination probe[was that] Jim Garrison conducted a fraudulent probe of the Kennedyassassination, which deflected attention from Carlos Marcello and disruptedserious investigation of the case.”Stung by such suspicions, Garrison wrote, “While I lay no pretense to being theepitome of virtue, with regard to connections with organized crime, I think youcan safely place me as having approximately the same such connections as MotherTeresa and Pope Paul. What has been occurring here, quite obviously, is theCIA’s disinformation machinery has been hard at work for a long time.”Further, Garrison once told this author that while elements within the mobundoubtedly played a role in Kennedy’s assassination, they were certainly aidedby elements within the US government. He said he wanted the architects of theassassination, not just the mechanics.To the charge that he was simply grandstanding, hoping for higher office,Garrison has stated, “A politically ambitious man would hardly be likely tochallenge the massed power of the federal government and criticize so manyhonorable figures and distinguished agencies. Actually, this charge is anargument in favor of my investigation: Would such a slimy type, eager toprofiteer on the assassination, jeopardize his political ambitions if he didn’thave an ironclad case?”While charge and countercharge, claim and counterclaim, surrounded Garrison, hecontinued to serve as an elected appeals court judge in New Orleans. Until hisdeath from cancer in 1992, Garrison continued to speak out for a truth heclaimed was denied five decades ago.Garrison believed President Kennedy was killed for one primary reason—he wasworking for reconciliation with Soviet Russia and Castro’s Cuba. Garrison wrote:To anyone with a grain of intelligence, it should be apparent that John Kennedywas eliminated by forces desiring the continuation of the Cold War—an artificialconflict draining the assets of and greatly changing, for the worst, thecharacter of our nation. The clandestine arm for those Cold War forces was theCentral Intelligence Agency—the destructive talents of which run the gambit[sic] from deception to murder.He has even identified those “forces,” stating:On the operative level of the conspiracy, you find anti-Castro Cuban exiles whonever forgave Kennedy for failing to send in U.S. air cover at the Bay of Pigs.. . . They believed sincerely that Kennedy had sold them out to the communists.On a higher, control level, you find a number of people of ultra-rightpersuasion—not simply conservatives, mind you, but people who could be describedas neo-Nazi including a small clique that had defected from the Minutemenbecause it had considered the group “too liberal.” These elements had theircanteens ready and their guns loaded; they lacked only a target. [After thesecret agreements of the Cuban Missile Crisis] Kennedy . . . began to crack downon CIA operations against Cuba. As a result, on July 31, 1963, the FBI raidedthe headquarters of the group of Cuban exiles and Minutemen training north ofLake Pontchartrain and confiscated all their guns and ammunition—despite thefact that the operation had the sanction of the CIA. This action may have sealedKennedy’s fate. . . . The link between the “command” level and the Cuban exileswas an amorphous group called the Free Cuba Committee [recall that this name wastied to Lee Harvey Oswald the night of the assassination by Dallas Countydistrict attorney Henry Wade, who was then corrected by none other than JackRuby], which with CIA sanction had been training north of Lake Pontchartrain foran assassination attempt on Fidel Castro. . . . Our information indicates thatit was shortly after this setback [the July 31, 1963, FBI raid] that the groupswitched direction and decided to assassinate John Kennedy instead of FidelCastro.This synopsis was voiced by Garrison in 1967, before there was any publicknowledge of Operation Mongoose. Theologian James W. Douglass came to the sameconclusion in his 2008 book, JFK and the Unspeakable, writing:JFK and RFK were targeted because they refused to comply with the nationalsecurity demands imposed upon them from the Bay of Pigs to the Cuban MissileCrisis and Vietnam. Two and a half years into his presidency, enlightened by theMissile Crisis and emboldened by the hope of peace, JFK had reached a pointwhere he began to transcend the ruling assumptions of national security. He wasinspired to seek peace with such enemies of the state as Nikita Khrushchev andFidel Castro.While this assessment may be debated for years to come, it nevertheless remainstrue that Garrison’s investigation in New Orleans did turn up much previouslyunknown evidence—another argument against his employment by the mob to deflectthe truth.Even the House committee’s Blakey, who termed Garrison’s investigation a“fraud,” conceded, “Garrison might have been on the right track, at least upuntil Ferrie’s untimely death . . . for evidence of an association betweenFerrie and Oswald, presented at the Clay Shaw trial, was found by the committeeto be credible.”"},{"pageContent":"The House Select Committee on Assassinations [Contents.html#rch17]By the mid-1970s, national polls indicated that very few Americans stillbelieved the Warren Commission’s lone-assassin theory, despite assurances of theEstablishment media and government spokesmen. According to one Gallup poll, 81percent of the American public believed President Kennedy’s death resulted froma conspiracy, while 70 percent believed the same regarding the death of Dr.Martin Luther King.These nagging doubts prompted congressman Henry Gonzalez of Texas to introduce aHouse resolution in February 1975 calling for a select committee to study notonly the death of John F. Kennedy, but also the deaths of Robert Kennedy andMartin Luther King, and the 1972 shooting of Alabama governor George Wallace.In remarks to fellow congressmen, Gonzalez said, “I have introduced thisresolution after much consideration. It has not been a decision I have madehastily. . . . There are questions to be resolved. I was at Dallas the day thatPresident Kennedy was killed and I suspended judgment on the questions thatarose then and shortly thereafter until Watergate, August 1972, revealedpossibilities heretofore considered not possible.”In an article published by St. Mary’s School of Law two months later, Gonzalezadded, “There are a few who have offered criticism of my efforts. . . . Theattitude of these people is to ‘let sleeping dogs lie.’ . . . I say that thisinvestigation is a need and has its proper place in our list of priorities. Whatfuture do we have as a nation if we let valid questions about theseassassinations go unresolved and uninvestigated except by private individuals?”Gonzalez’s House Resolution 204 was joined by a similar resolution, sponsored bylame-duck representative Thomas N. Downing of Virginia. In remarks to fellowcongressmen on March 18, 1976, Downing complained of foot-dragging:In the past few weeks, certain events have transpired in this House whichconcern me deeply and which lead me to believe either I don’t understand theHouse half as well as I thought I did, or that the House is undergoing a deepand fundamental transformation as a result of those tragic events which wecollectively label “Watergate.” Until now, it has seemed to me that, althoughCongress might not have dealt with all problems wisely, it has not been itspolicy simply and doggedly to refuse to look at a serious national problem, nomatter how difficult, no matter how distressing. Yet, I fear that is preciselywhat it is doing today. It is simply and doggedly refusing to look at theproblem of who executed our former President, John F. Kennedy, and why he wasexecuted. I do not exaggerate. I have chosen my words carefully, and I meanprecisely what I say. . . . However, we not only have failed to make anyprogress toward establishment of such an investigating committee, we also havenot even been able to get a hearing on the merits before the Rules Committee. .. . I have been told informally that “the Leadership” is against reopening theWarren Commission’s findings, and that is that. . . . Why would there bereluctance on the part of the Leadership and the committee? Have they been toldby the Intelligence Community, which, incidentally, possibly acted as soleinvestigators for the Warren Commission, what really did happen to our youngPresident, and why? Do they know who was behind the killing? Is it too horriblefor the American people to face? . . . Someone apparently does not want us tosee the evil, hear the evil and certainly does not want us to talk about it. . .. After all, if a President is eliminated, not by a “lone nut,” but forpolitical reasons, isn’t the whole fabric of our form of government in directdanger if we cover up the political motivations and go on as if nothinghappened?Despite these passionate appeals for a reinvestigation into the assassinations,action stalled in the House for more than a year. The Rules Committee simplyrefused to even consider the idea.Finally in mid-1976, the Black Caucus, at the instigation of Dr. King’s wife,Coretta, put pressure on the House leadership, and the Gonzalez and Downingbills were merged into House Resolution 1540 and passed in September 1976.However, the committee would expire at the end of the congressional term onJanuary 3, 1977.Trouble began immediately. House tradition dictated that the author of aresolution creating a select committee be named chair. Downing, who had notsought reelection in 1976, would soon retire and Gonzalez, a highlyindividualistic Mexican-American, was not liked by House power brokers.Despite Downing’s lame-duck status, he was named chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations by Speaker Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill, a decision thatdid not please Gonzalez, who began to serve as cochairman.Early on, Downing wanted Washington attorney Bernard Fensterwald to serve as thecommittee’s chief counsel and director. Fensterwald, who had formed aclearinghouse of assassination material called the Committee to InvestigateAssassinations, was an early critic of the Warren Commission and thoroughlyfamiliar with most aspects of the John F. Kennedy case.Gonzalez objected and Fensterwald withdrew from consideration, but not before anarticle appeared in the Washington Star under the headline ASSASSINATION INQUIRYSTUMBLING—IS FENSTERVVALD A CIA PLANT? Later it was learned that information forthis attack came from Gonzalez’s office.In October 1976, Downing and Gonzalez settled on a former Philadelphiaprosecutor, Richard A. Sprague, as the committee’s chief counsel. Initially,Sprague seemed like an excellent choice. He had a record of sixty-nineconvictions out of seventy homicide cases, and was well regarded as a tough andindependent prosecutor. He had received national attention by his prosecution ofUnited Mine Workers president Tony Boyle for the murder of UMW reformer JosephYablonski.Sprague stated he planned to break his investigation into two separate areas:one for John Kennedy and one for Dr. King. He said these assassination inquirieswould be treated as homicide investigations. This was a novel approach to theKennedy assassination since, until that time, all investigation and deliberationhad been conducted in secret by the government.Bypassing the FBI and the CIA, Sprague hired professional investigators andcriminal lawyers from New York City. He made it clear that his investigationwould not hesitate to look into FBI and CIA involvement and that he would usesubpoena power and lie-detector tests to get to the truth. Aware of the CIAconnections to the Kennedy assassination, Sprague let it be known he planned tosubpoena both agency files and personnel.Sprague also contacted many of the responsible Kennedy assassinationresearchers, including district attorney Jim Garrison in New Orleans, andprivately told them he planned to use them as committee consultants. He was alsotruthful in projecting the costs of such a massive investigation, saying heneeded a staff of at least two hundred and an initial budget of $6.5 million tostart work.Sprague’s openness about both his needs and his goals prompted immediate outrageamong congressmen who had never wanted the committee in the first place. Many ofthese lambasted Sprague for his statements about using lie detectors, voicestress analyzers, and hidden tape recorders to learn the truth. Soon Sprague wastoo busy fending off media attacks to get his investigation rolling.Other developments began to raise doubts in the minds of many assassinationresearchers, whose hopes had grown since the committee was created. To beginwith, Sprague early on stated, “I have not, as of this date, read the WarrenCommission Report or testimony. But I have never read any books by the critics,either.”This unfamiliarity with the assassination was reflected in Sprague’s selectionof the prosecutors and lawmen as investigators and staff for the committee. Manywere aggressive and able but they did not understand the full ramifications ofthe case. Many had ties back to the FBI or CIA and none of them had the time toproperly study the convoluted assassination issues.In recent years it was learned that the CIA had a man inside the committee. TheCIA grudgingly acknowledged that George Joannides, a thirty-year veteran of theagency, was paying out $51,000 a month to the Cuban Student Directorate, ananti-Castro organization whose members publicized Lee Oswald’s pro-Castroactivities both before and after the assassination. It also was learned thatJoannides served as the CIA’s principal coordinator with the committee but didnot disclose his role in the anti-Castro events of 1963.In 2009 reporter Scott Shane of the New York Times wrote, “That concealment hasfueled suspicion that Mr. Joannides’s real assignment was to limit what theHouse committee could learn about CIA activities.” In 2013, the agency still waswithholding nearly three hundred documents pertaining to the anti-Cubanactivities of the early 1960s, claiming release could cause “extreme gravedamage” to national security.Documents released in 2007 following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showedthat Joannides had received the Career Intelligence Medal, one of the CIA’shighest honors, in July 1981, less than three years after he stonewalled theHouse committee regarding agency activities. A Justice Department officialdenied that the medal had any relation to Joannides’s work with the committeebut failed to provide any substantiation.Despite Sprague’s wooing of the research community, those with detailedknowledge of the cases, with few exceptions, were excluded from the Housecommittee’s staff.Then there was the question of Sprague’s close friendship with his former bossArlen Specter, the Warren Commission staffer who created the “single bullet”theory of the assassination. Sprague was pushed to protest, “I did not talk toArlen before I took this thing.”Sprague incensed Gonzalez immediately by renting a plush apartment inWashington’s Watergate complex, then leaving for a vacation in Acapulco withoutinforming the committee’s founder.With his absence and presumptuous pronouncements, Sprague was making enemieseverywhere. Representative Robert E. Bauman of Maryland charged that Sprague“virtually assumed the role of chairman of the committee.”As 1976 drew to a close and Sprague found himself under attack by the media,including the New York Times, the committee’s reconstitution in January suddenlybegan to appear precarious.Sprague was baffled at the hostility directed at him. He told committeestaffers, “You know, I don’t understand it. I’ve never been in a situation likethis before where I am getting criticized for things I might do. It’s nonsense,but I don’t know why it’s happening.”His proposed budget was targeted for attack, but Sprague held his ground,saying, “Several people around here who are familiar with the bureaucratic gametold me to first present a smaller budget. They assured me that I could alwaysgo back later and plead for more. That’s the way they do things in Washington, Iwas told. Well, I won’t play that game.”The press attacks caused second thoughts in Congress. A resolutionreconstituting the Assassinations Committee by a unanimous-consent voice vote onJanuary 4, 1977, failed. It would take weeks of maneuvering before the committeecould officially be reconstituted. By this time, Downing had retired andGonzalez had been named chairman.Suddenly the outside media attacks on Sprague were joined by an unexpectedsource—committee chairman Gonzalez. According to people familiar with thissituation, Gonzalez, already angered at not being named chairman until afterDowning retired and at Sprague’s early activities or lack of them, was furtherincensed that Sprague would not allow him to run the committee the way he sawfit.And there was the continuing problem of funding. Sprague had been told he had$150,000 a month for expenses until the committee was reconstituted in January1977. Later he found out that amount actually was only $84,000, which caused acost overrun for which Gonzalez was taken to task by the House RulesCommittee—the same committee that had stalled the Assassinations Committee inthe first place. Gonzalez claimed Sprague had spent money without his knowledgeor consent.Gonzalez ordered Sprague to take a “number of steps,” including giving writtenassurance that he would stay within the financial constraints of the committee’sfunding and firing recently hired staff members. Sprague’s refusal to bow toGonzalez’s demands prompted the hot-tempered Texas representative to orderSprague to return all Gonzalez letterhead material.Staff investigator Gaeton Fonzi noted, “Since all congressional committees usethe postal franking privileges of its chairman, and every expense voucher,travel order, and most directives and requests are made under the chairman’ssignature, what Gonzalez was doing, in effect, was virtually stopping theoperation of the committee.”Next Gonzalez further blocked the committee’s work by asking the attorneygeneral to deny staffers’ access to FBI files and by cutting off theirlong-distance phone calls. Sprague reportedly remarked to coworkers, “Gonzalezwent berserk.”Finally, in a hand-delivered letter, Gonzalez charged Sprague with being“engaged in a course of conduct that is wholly intolerable for any employee ofthe House” and ordered him to vacate his office that same day. However, within afew hours the other eleven members of the committee had written their ownletter, instructing Sprague to ignore Gonzalez. This infighting continued, withGonzalez telling reporters that Sprague was a “rattlesnake.”It appears that both Gonzalez and Sprague may have been the objects of secretpersonal smear campaigns—with Sprague being told Gonzalez was trying to subvertthe committee’s work while Gonzalez was being told that Sprague was a CIA planton the committee.Early in March 1977, Gonzalez resigned from the Assassinations Committeeclaiming that Sprague had refused to cut costs and had tried to undermine hisauthority as chairman. Back home in San Antonio, Gonzalez told a reporter he hadbeen forced out of the investigation by “vast and powerful forces, including thecountry’s most sophisticated criminal element.” Gonzalez told reporters, “I amlike a guy who’s been slugged before he’s got a chance to fight. . . . It was anexercise in futility. The fix was in.”While the life of the committee had been extended for two more months inJanuary, it was due to expire at the end of March 1977. Near that time, a newchairman was named—Representative Louis Stokes, a low-key black Democrat fromOhio. With the more acceptable Stokes in charge, the Assassinations Committeewas revived by House Resolution 433, which passed on March 30, 1977,reconstituting the committee until January 3, 1979, and assigning it apared-down budget of $2.5 million.Just before the House vote to continue the committee, Sprague was called toStokes’s office. Despite having been promised support by Stokes and othercommittee members, Sprague could see the writing on the wall. He told them,“Gentlemen, it’s clear it’s in everyone’s best interest if I resign.” Sprague’sresignation prompted several committee members to state publicly that the chiefcounsel had been the victim of a McCarthy-like witch hunt and characterassassination.Although the committee had existed for six months, the constant bickering andlack of funds prevented any meaningful work. Throughout its brief life, itsfocus so far had been not on assassinations, but on sheer survival.Earlier in March, Fonzi—still on the job—had tried to contact the last-knownclose friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, George DeMohrenschildt, who was staying inManalapan, Florida. Soon after arriving home and learning of Fonzi’s visit,DeMohrenschildt was found fatally shot. His death was ruled a suicide. Fonzilater wrote, “The manner in which the Assassination Committee reacted to thedeath of George DeMohrenschildt revealed that the Committee—six months after itwas formed—was still totally incapable of functioning as an investigative body.It reflected six months of political reality and how successful its opponentshad been in keeping it distracted and off-balance.”Representative Gonzalez stated simply, “Strong organized forces have combined tostop the inquiry at any cost.”In June 1977, a new chief counsel was selected—G. Robert Blakey, a respectedacademician with impressive credentials but with no real desire to probe theassassinations.Blakey at the Helm [Contents.html#rsec89]No investigation can be better than its leadership, and with its new chiefcounsel and director, the House Select Committee on Assassinations was noexception.G. Robert Blakey, a professor of law and director of the Notre Dame Institute onOrganized Crime, spent four years in the organized-crime and racketeeringsection of the Kennedy Justice Department; was chief counsel to the SenateSubcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures; was principal consultant topresident Lyndon Johnson’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration ofJustice; and was a consultant to the publications Time, Life, and Look.Upon becoming chief counsel and director for the House Select Committee onAssassinations, Blakey firmly took control of the panel and its investigation.He oversaw every aspect of the committee’s work, selecting witnesses, decidingwhich leads to follow and which to ignore, picking the expert panels, hiring andfiring staff members, and setting the committee’s agenda.It quickly became obvious that the Assassinations Committee was changingdirections in key areas. Where Sprague had opted for openness in the committee’sinquiry, Blakey advocated secrecy. In fact, in his first statement to the newsmedia, Blakey announced, “The purpose of this news conference is to announcethere will be no more news conferences.”Blakey also announced that the committee would not look at any new evidence inthe Kennedy and King assassinations, but would concentrate on evaluating the oldevidence the federal government had accumulated.His turnaround prompted assassination researchers to take a closer look at thenew chief counsel, with some disturbing results.Having worked for both President Johnson and President Nixon, Blakey had closecontact with other ranking government officials involved in the Kennedyassassination case, among them:Nicholas Katzenbach: the deputy attorney general who in 1964 put strong pressureon the Warren Commission to quickly endorse the premise that Lee Harvey Oswaldacted alone.Leon Jaworski: the Watergate special prosecutor who served as a special counselto the Warren Commission charged with determining whether Oswald had any ties toUS intelligence. (Jaworski found none, but some years later it was discoveredthat a foundation of which Jaworski was a trustee secretly used CIA funds.)Lewis F. Powell: the attorney named by the American Bar Association as anobserver to the Warren Commission to protect Oswald’s rights, but who spent muchof his time trying to have Commission critic Mark Lane disbarred.Although considered an expert in the “war against crime,” Blakey apparently hada strange connection with a reputed big-time gambler. In 1975, when Penthousemagazine was sued for referring to California’s La Costa Resort and Spa as aplayground for gangsters, it was Blakey who sold his expertise and provided anaffidavit condemning the magazine’s charges of mob ownership while concedingignorance of the truth of the charges. Any questions concerning this odd supportof a resort built by Teamster pension-fund money were referred to Blakey’s ownattorney, Louis Nizer.Furthermore, Blakey was recommended as chief counsel by Committee memberrepresentative Christopher Dodd, the former law partner of former FBI directorL. Patrick Gray, who was indicted during the Watergate scandals.While these connections don’t prove compromise on Blakey’s part, they do cast ashadow over his credentials as an uncompromising crime-buster. They also raisedconcerns in many minds about Blakey’s motives.But is there any evidence that the Assassinations Committee’s findings wereundermined?Apparently so. The main weapon Blakey used to stop a meaningful investigationwas a nondisclosure agreement. Signing this agreement, which was institutedwithin one week of Blakey’s arrival, was mandatory for continued employment withthe committee. Even independent researchers who attempted to share assassinationinformation with the panel were made to sign it.The agreement bound the signer not to reveal that he or she even worked for thecommittee or to reveal anything learned while serving with the committee; gavethe committee the power to take legal action against the signer in the event ofdisclosures, even long after the committee ended; and made the signer agree thatall legal fees would be paid should the signer lose such a court suit.Many persons who have seen this agreement, including attorneys, claim itviolates the US Constitution and therefore is illegal. However, it stopped mostof the committee’s personnel and hired consultants from discussing the workingsof the HSCA.Evidence of the weak legal standing of this agreement may be found in thatGaeton Fonzi has written scathing articles against the committee and itsoperation, in apparent violation of this agreement, yet there has been noprosecution.The agreement also effectively muzzled many of the assassination researchers.Blakey invited ten prominent critics of the Warren Commission to Washington toexchange assassination information. All were required to sign the nondisclosureagreement, and all presented their information. Blakey reciprocated with nothingof value. After their departure, Blakey instructed the committee staff to haveno further contact with these researchers without his personal and specificauthorization. He explained such secrecy was necessary to protect thereputations of people involved in the investigation—the “innocentassociates”—and that he wanted the committee to “remain immune from the fever ofassassination demonology.”Even more disquieting to researchers was Blakey’s accommodating attitude towardthe FBI and the CIA—the two agencies that over the years have become suspectsthemselves in many people’s minds. Earlier, Sprague had put both agencies onnotice that subpoenas might be issued for access to assassination materialwithheld from previous investigations, such as pre-assassination CIA activity inMexico City and the connections between Ruby and Oswald and the FBI.Under Blakey, committee investigators had to sign a CIA secrecy oath beforeexamining any classified files, thus giving the agency the authority to “clear”any information, including investigators’ notes.A January 25, 1978, committee report stated:All staff members on the Committee have received or are in the process ofreceiving “Top Secret” security clearances. The FBI, as an accommodation to theCommittee, conducts the background investigations for these security clearances.The CIA then reviews the background investigations done by the FBI. Afterconsultation with the FBI and CIA, the full Committee makes the determinationregarding an individual’s security clearance.In other words, both intelligence agencies had direct control over whoparticipated in the committee’s investigation. This situation did nothing toease the minds of researchers who already were convinced of intelligenceinvolvement in the Kennedy assassination.Several people were fired from the committee staff for failing to receive asecurity clearance, including one person whom Blakey reportedly told, “The CIAwould be more comfortable if you were gone.” It has never been explained howthis clearance review was made to conform with the CIA charter prohibitionagainst domestic activities.In a TV interview, original counsel Sprague stated he had refused to yield toCIA and FBI demands for security clearances, as such agreements would have giventhese agencies authority to decide what the committee could disclose. Spragueargued, “What’s the point of getting material in the first place, if they aregoing to control who sees it and what we can do with it?”Blakey showed no such insight. In fact, in an article by writer Jerry Policoff,Blakey is quoted as saying, “I’ve worked with the CIA for twenty years. Wouldthey lie to me?”And there is evidence that Blakey’s trust in the agency went beyond simplenaïveté. After it was discovered that the CIA held a 201 file on Lee HarveyOswald—evidence that he worked for the agency, according to several former CIAagents—Blakey retrieved the file from CIA headquarters. According to the Housecommittee, the folder was virtually empty. Agency officials explained that thefile was actually just a “personality” file that had contained a few newsclippings on Oswald after being opened on December 9, 1960.Yet researchers today have a copy of a CIA “Memorandum for the Record” datedApril 27, 1979, which states:On 27 April, 1979, Mr. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel and staff director of theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), visited CIA Headquarters. . . .Mr. Blakey examined only that material held [Blanked out]. He apparently did notgo elsewhere within the Agency, [Blanked out] to examine their holdings. . . .Comment: Files reviewed by HSCA staff members fill nine four-drawer safes. Thefiles include the Lee Harvey Oswald 201, which fills two four-drawer safes.Oswald’s 201 file was not completely reviewed by HSCA staff members.Despite not reviewing all of the CIA’s held material—including Oswald’s 201file—the House committee confidently concluded, “The Secret Service, FederalBureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency were not involved inthe assassination of President Kennedy.”In 1978, the CIA agent assigned as liaison to the HSCA reportedly was fired fromthe agency after rifling the safe containing the Kennedy autopsy photos andX-rays. The agent claimed he had an innocent explanation but would not give itto the press. “There’s other things that are involved,” he told the WashingtonPost’s George Lardner, “that are detrimental to other things.”Such activities forced some investigators to resign from the committee, citingcontrol by intelligence agencies and their feeling that the investigation hadbecome too narrow in focus.Other staff members—including twenty-four investigators—were discharged ongrounds that the committee had no money. Yet in February 1978, Blakey returned$425,000 to Congress, saying the funds were not needed.Whether or not the charges that Blakey sidetracked any meaningful investigationare true, the seeds of doubt were sown. This is reflected in a magazine articleby Jerry Policoff and William Scott Malone, who wrote in 1978, “So poisoned hasthe atmosphere become from months of bitterness that whatever conclusions theCommittee comes up with will be suspect.”According to assassination researchers who followed the HSCA closely, Blakeyforced out or fired some of the most able investigators, severely restrictedareas of investigation, handpicked scientific experts who mostly denied any hintof conspiracy, and then locked committee investigative material away for fiftyyears.Although there has been no definitive evidence to demonstrate that this was hisagenda, if Blakey had wanted to restrict and misdirect the investigations of theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations, he could not have done a better job.[images/line.jpg]With Blakey’s arrival, aspects of the HSCA investigation changed dramatically.Under Sprague, committee investigators had been running down promising leads inDallas, Miami, New Orleans, and Memphis. Under Blakey, these fieldinvestigations—far from the oversight of Washington power—were severelyrestricted. The focus of the Kennedy probe moved away from looking atintelligence and anti-Castro Cuban involvement and began scrutinizing theorganized-crime aspects.Somewhere along the way, the committee dropped any investigation into the RobertF. Kennedy assassination and the shooting of Alabama governor Wallace, despitethe abundance of evidence raising serious questions about the official versionsof both those events.By October 1977, a Scripps-Howard article stated, “The Committee’s investigationof the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has been scaled down and thepanel’s professional staff apparently has been spending virtually all its timeexploring new leads in the King case.”On March 13, 1978, the HSCA received House approval for $2.5 million in fundingto last until January 3, 1979. The final vote of 204 to 175 was achieved despiteobjections from some Republican representatives who claimed the committee hadaccomplished little in its year and a half of existence.Scaled down and with a restricted agenda, the committee nevertheless went towork. According to Blakey, the committee spent a total of $5.5 million duringits thirty-month investigation. In an introduction to the committee’s report,Blakey wrote, “[This] may sound like a lot, but it should be contrasted with thefact that the Warren Commission spent the equivalent in 1977 dollars of over $10million in ten months.”Blakey admitted that early on the HSCA experienced “some rough sailing” and thatthe period of “rigorous fact-finding” lasted only six months—from January toJuly 1978. However, this fact-finding was “intense and wide ranging,” wroteBlakey. He claimed that committee members and staffers made trips to Mexico,Canada, Portugal, England, and Cuba. There were a total of 562 trips to 1,463points for more than 4,758 days of field investigation. More than 4,924interviews were conducted and 335 witnesses heard, some in public hearings andsome in executive session.Beginning in late July 1978, the HSCA conducted a series of public hearings thatlasted until September 28, 1978. There was a parade of technical and scientificexperts, but no one cross-examined them. No one asked the obvious follow-up orembarrassing question. And the testimony of each witness seemed designed tofurther cement the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin of Kennedy.Some witnesses, such as Louie Steven Witt—who claimed to have been the “umbrellaman” in Dealey Plaza—gave an implausible story that went unchallenged.Dr. James Humes, the leader of the Kennedy autopsy team, was never asked why hewaited fifteen years to become convinced that a bullet entered near the top ofKennedy’s head well above where the other two autopsy doctors still placed it.Humes also could have given more details about the military authorities presentat the autopsy who directed the doctors in their inadequate work, but he wasnever asked in public. Humes later quipped, “They had their chance and they blewit.”Many of the researchers watching the televised hearings felt the testimony wasorchestrated and that it followed carefully selected lines of interrogation.This perception prompted a group of researchers who had formed an AssassinationInformation Bureau to comment:[There was] no one to remind the on-looking press and the nation that Blakey’scase against Oswald looks as good as it does primarily because no one with equalstaff, budget and time has had the opportunity to take it in hand, pull open itsseams and show the world what it is really made of. Blakey and the Committee mayat the moment enjoy a certain sense of victory, but their decision to shut downthe other side’s chances at rebuttal and rejoinder will eventually work againstthe credibility of their results. Another one-sided trial of an undefendedOswald is not what the people paid $6 million to see.The committee also failed to mention the amount of medical evidence that isstill missing.And—more ominously—some material given to the committee also turned up missing.FOX News commentator Bill O’Reilly in 1963 was a news reporter for WFAA-TV inDallas. He recalled:A guy who was [in Dealey Plaza] at the time watching the motorcade. His sonfound [a bullet]. I can’t remember his name. . . . But he wanted to remainanonymous. . . . He gave me this little cylinder. He said that his son had foundit on the ground that day. . . . It was definitely a slug. And the guy said hedefinitely dug it out of there. . . . It was something I came across and held.And then when the Committee started, I handed it over to Gaeton [Fonzi], . . .and I don’t think anything ever came of it. It was a pistol slug, I’m prettysure. But again, I’m not positive. . . . But again I am no ballistics expert soit could have been a rifle slug.Fonzi recalled getting the slug from O’Reilly. He said, “I wound up with theslug just prior to going with the Committee. I gave the slug to the chiefinvestigator, Cliff Fenton, with the Committee and never heard any more of it. Ikept asking Cliff whether he turned it over for analysis or what he did with it.I kept getting noncommittal answers.”Asked about the slug in 1982, Fenton said, “I don’t know nothing about that. Thebest thing I can tell you is to talk to Rep. Stokes. I don’t make any comment onthe Assassinations Committee. . . . You got to forgive me for that but that’sthe way I am.”As the committee closed its public hearings and moved toward presenting itsfinal report in the late fall of 1978, it was apparent that its findings inregard to the JFK assassination would parallel those of the WarrenCommission—that Kennedy had been killed by two bullets fired by Lee HarveyOswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and that Oswaldhad acted alone.But then Blakey—who had carefully restricted the JFK assassination investigationto simply a reevaluation of previous evidence—was hoisted on his own petard.Two separate scientific studies of a Dallas police radio recording revealedevidence that more than one gunman fired on Kennedy in Dallas.The Dallas Police Radio Recording [Contents.html#rsec90]Even before asking for more funding in March 1978, the House Select Committee onAssassinations already had uncovered a bombshell in the JFK investigation.Sophisticated scientific acoustical studies of a Dallas police radio recordingindicated that more than one assassin was involved in Kennedy’s death. Thisevidence, which prompted immediate controversy, destroyed the WarrenCommission’s theory of a lone gunman and forced the Assassinations Committee tocompletely reverse its findings at the last moment.The episode began with an event very familiar to serious assassinationresearchers—an eight-minute “gap” in Dallas police radio broadcasts during theassassination gunfire.Apparently a Dallas policeman—a motorcycle officer by the sound of a nearbymotorcycle engine—opened his microphone about two minutes before the shootingstarted and left it open for about eight minutes.In late 1976, Gary Mack, today curator of the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas,obtained a copy of the Dallas police radio recording in the belief that the openmicrophone had been in Dealey Plaza. He began studying it for sounds of gunfire.He reasoned that if the microphone was indeed open in Dealey Plaza, it must havepicked up the sounds of the shots.By September 1977, he had enhanced the quality of the tape and concluded thatthe recording indicated as many as seven shots.Mack obtained a copy of the tape closer to the original. He explained, “Findingthe precise location of the shots, then, was easy and [after filtering out muchof the motorcycle engine noise] we heard the first shot . . . a very loud, sharpcrack immediately following some conversation between two policemen.”The existence of the police recording became known to the AssassinationsCommittee, which then obtained what was thought to be the original recordingfrom a retired Dallas police lieutenant.This original recording—termed a Dictabelt—was turned over to the acoustics firmof Bolt, Beranek & Newman Inc. for sophisticated scientific tests. Dr. JamesBarger, the firm’s chief scientist, converted the sounds on the tape intodigitized waveforms to produce a visual picture. The study also looked into“sequence of impulses,” which could differentiate sharp, loud noises such asgunshots from subsequent echoes. Barger determined there were at least six suchimpulses and asked for further tests, including an on-site test in Dealey Plaza.By summer 1978, Blakey was aware that the acoustical scientists supported Mack’scontention that the tape showed gunfire from more than one location. In fact,during their public testimony, the acoustical scientists stated that there wereas many as nine sounds on the Dallas recording that could not be ruled out asgunshots.But after the Dealey Plaza testing from two locations, they could confirm onlyfour shots—at least one from the Grassy Knoll.Additionally, the tape showed that one shot came only 1.6 seconds behindanother. Since the FBI had carefully determined that it required at least 2.3seconds to cock and fire the Carcano rifle twice, this was further evidence ofmore than one assassin.Blakey shocked committee members with this information, and staff members beganto reconsider their conclusions—but not until after the police tape was turnedover to yet another team of acoustical scientists for a second opinion. Blakeywrote, “It was deemed judicious to seek an independent review of Barger’sanalysis before proceeding with the acoustical reconstruction.”The tape was then studied by Professor Mark Weiss of Queen’s College of the CityUniversity of New York and his associate, Ernest Aschkenasy. Weiss andAschkenasy agreed with Barger’s findings and also encouraged on-site testing.The idea was to create computerized graphic pictures of the sound patterns ofrifle shots in Dealey Plaza and to match them against the patterns discovered inthe police recording.Beginning at dawn on Sunday, August 20, 1978, three Dallas police sharpshootersfired a total of fifty-six live bullets into three piles of sandbags locatedalong the motorcade route on Elm Street. Rifles were fired from twolocations—the southeast comer of the sixth floor of the Texas School BookDepository and from behind the wooden picket fence on the Grassy Knoll.Interestingly, a .38-caliber pistol also was fired from the knoll, leading manyresearchers to speculate that the committee must have received informationleading them to believe a pistol may have been used in the assassination.However, at the time no one could explain why the pistol was test fired. Dallaspolice commented they were unaware of the committee’s desire to test fire thepistol until the day before the tests.It also should be noted that two of the three piles of sandbags were located inthe middle lane of Elm Street, exactly where films show the presidentiallimousine. However, one pile—apparently representing one of the early shots—waslocated in the far left lane. Asked why it was in this location, Dallas policesharpshooter Jerry Compton, positioned in the Depository, said he could not geta line of sight on the bags when it was in the center lane due to interveningtree branches.Less than a year before these tests, a film crew had worked in Dealey Plazaproducing a network movie titled The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. The tree thatprevented a line of sight between the sixth-floor Depository window and thelocation of the first shot had been pruned back to its 1963 size, based onphotographs taken the day of the assassination. Compton’s inability to fire atthe center lane because of the obstructing tree supported researchers who hadlong claimed that a gunman on the Depository’s sixth floor would have nounobstructed line of sight to this location.As the police marksmen fired their weapons, a line of microphones was movedalong the motorcade route recording 432 impulses or “acoustical fingerprints.”Later, matching up the tape sounds with the test sounds, two of the six possibleshots were ruled out as having been fired from the Depository or theknoll—leaving the possibility that shots came from other locations.This still left four sounds that did match.After refining their acoustical tests, Weiss and Aschkenasy concluded, “With acertainty factor of 95 percent or better, there was a shot fired at thepresidential limousine from the Grassy Knoll.”Barger agreed with this assessment and added that sound from the knoll waspreceded by an N-wave, or supersonic shock wave, proving that the sound was thatof a rifle bullet, which is a supersonic missile.The House committee studied photographs taken on November 22, 1963, as well asDallas police assignments and concluded that the microphone that recorded theshots was on the motorcycle of Patrolman H. B. McLain.McLain testified his was the first motorcycle to the left of Vice PresidentJohnson’s car. He acknowledged that his motorcycle was in the correct locationto record the shots, based on the acoustical studies, and that his microphoneoften got stuck in the “on” position.However, a week after the committee was disbanded, McLain suddenly reversed hisposition, claiming it could not have been his microphone that relayed thesounds. Stating that he had accompanied the presidential limousine to ParklandHospital, McLain told news reporters, “That wasn’t my motorcycle. There wouldhave been a siren on that Channel 1 all the way to the hospital. Everybody hadtheir sirens on . . . you would have heard that on Channel 1.” McLain said hecame to this conclusion belatedly because when he testified to the committee, hehad not listened to the police recording. To complicate matters, anassassination photograph showed McLain had lagged behind and was still in DealeyPlaza after the presidential limousine raced off.But McLain’s criticism of these findings was just the beginning of a controversyover the acoustical studies and their conclusions. Not long after the committeeissued its report citing at least four shots at Kennedy, the FBI publiclydisputed the acoustical studies. In news stories carried nationwide, the bureaustated that the findings of the acoustical scientists and the committee were“invalid.” This announcement prompted Blakey to term the FBI report “asophomoric analysis . . . superficial, shoddy and shot full of holes.”And the controversy continued.At the request of the Justice Department—parent agency of the FBI—the NationalScience Foundation authorized a $23,360 study of the acoustical evidence by aNational Academy of Sciences panel headed by Harvard University physicsprofessor Norman S. Ramsey.The Ramsey panel, as it came to be called, decided on the basis of apparentsounds from police Channel 2 (the motorcade security channel) being found onChannel 1 (the regular police channel) that such “cross talk” meant the policerecordings were unreliable. Ramsey’s Committee on Ballistic Acoustics concluded,“The acoustic analyses do not demonstrate that there was a Grassy Knoll shot . .. [and] do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman.”However, in the months following the Ramsey panel’s announcement, its findingswere called into question by researcher Gary Mack, the originator of therecording study, who pointed out that Ramsey had based his studies on problemsinvolving the automatic gain control (AGC), a system to equalize the volume of aradio receiver. Dallas police Channel 1 had no AGC circuitry at that time, Mackpointed out. Two members of Ramsey’s panel admitted that if there was no AGC inthe Dallas police radios, their analysis of the tapes would have to be redone.Well into the mid-1980s the controversy over the acoustical tests continued,with one expert challenging another expert and one technical argument beingresolved only to find yet another waiting. A 2001 peer-reviewed article inScience and Justice, a quarterly publication of Britain’s Forensic ScienceSociety, claimed the Ramsey panel study was seriously flawed. The author of thearticle, D. B. Thomas, a government scientist and JFK assassination researcher,said his study proved there was a shot from the Grassy Knoll in addition tothree shots from the Depository. HSCA chief counsel Blakey said Thomas’s workproved a shot from a second gunman on the knoll. “We thought there was a 95percent chance it was a shot. He puts it at 96.3 percent. Either way, that’sbeyond a reasonable doubt,” Blakey commented.Keep in mind that there is now evidence to suggest that the Dallas policerecordings may have been edited or otherwise altered while in the hands offederal authorities in the days following the assassination. If the tapes werealtered, then the entire acoustical controversy has to go back to square one.Despite the continuing controversy, the acoustical evidence prompted a completeturnabout in the official version of the JFK assassination.[images/line.jpg]The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a preliminary report onDecember 30, 1978.Out of time and money, but faced with the acoustical test results, it couldconclude only that President John F. Kennedy “was probably assassinated as aresult of a conspiracy” but that the committee was “unable to identify the othergunman or the extent of the conspiracy.”Under Blakey, the committee had gone right to the finish trying to find Oswaldthe lone assassin. Then at the eleventh hour, they were forced to conclude thatat least two assassins were involved.Conspiracy advocates were greatly pleased with this substantiation of more thanone gunman in the Kennedy murder. Others were not so impressed.Warren Commission attorney David Belin argued, “Congress is just plain wrong.There was no second gunman firing from the Grassy Knoll. I’ve seen lots ofexpert testimony where people differ.” Oswald’s mother, Marguerite, commented,“The select committee has done its work, tried hard, they are men of integrity,but they made the same mistake as the Warren Commission. My late son, Lee HarveyOswald, was framed for the murder of President Kennedy.”So the controversy over President Kennedy’s assassination, far from beingsettled by the House committee, continued anew. Only this time, researchers andcritics of the Warren Commission had gained new ammunition through informationgained by the committee, and they were now supported in their conspiracytheories by a governmental body.Even after the committee had concluded its work, controversy about its operationcontinued. Five months later, Robert Groden, who had served as staffphotographic consultant to the HSCA, told the news media the committee hadpulled its punches:The direction of the entire House Assassinations Committee rested on one pieceof evidence from the beginning—the autopsy photographs. And, from the beginninguntil the introduction of the acoustical evidence, the autopsy panel assumed theautopsy evidence was genuine. I was not allowed to study the autopsy photographsuntil December [1978—less than a month before the committee disbanded] and whenI did study them, I found at least two were phonies, which can be proved to anyreasonable person.Groden’s charge has now been substantiated by autopsy photographer Floyd Rebeand by several of the Dallas doctors who worked to save President Kennedy’slife. Interviewed by the Baltimore Sun in 1979, the Dallas physiciansunanimously agreed that the photograph the House Committee made public was notremotely like the wounds they saw in 1963.Veteran newsman Seth Kantor, who, because of his years working in both Dallasand Fort Worth prior to and during the assassination, may be one of the mostknowledgeable media persons on that event, told this author the entire Housecommittee episode was “strange and unusual”:The Committee tried to play to Congress . . . by not touching certain basesbecause certain congressmen didn’t want it. . . . The original chairman[Downing] was about to retire . . . the committee was loaded with second-echelonHouse members, not leadership quality and with not much clout. . . . When Blakeycame in, he wiped out the leadership of the [committee’s] staff and the newpeople that came in had to start from square one. The investigators sent toDallas had no working knowledge of the case. . . . My biggest grievance with thecommittee is that they did not investigate the Dallas police force. Blakey saidhe had no mandate to investigate the Dallas police. More than half the life ofthe committee was frittered away.Many researchers’ view of the committee’s work was summed up by Groden, whowrote:In the end, the Committee consumed millions of dollars and accomplished little.The Select Committee never did the simple things required to get to the truth.Reluctantly, the committee identified the existence of a “conspiracy” in theKennedy and King assassinations. But the admission of “conspiracy” was a smallbreakthrough—the public had suspected it for years. The real truth about who wasbehind the conspiracies was left undisturbed.Having totally reversed the government’s view of the JFK assassination bystating publicly that a conspiracy “probably” resulted in Kennedy’s death andthat at least two gunmen fired at the president, chief counsel Blakey, writingin an introduction to the committee’s report, noted, “Realizing that there wouldbe an opportunity for others to fill in the details—that there might beindictments and trials as a result of future investigation—we decided to presentan understated case. We chose a cautious approach.”An understated case? Consider these points as determined by the committee: • A conspiracy involving at least two gunmen resulted in PresidentKennedy’s death. • Jack Ruby’s killing of Oswald was not spontaneous and Ruby likelyentered the Dallas police station basement with assistance. • The Dallas police withheld from the Warren Commission relevantinformation about Ruby’s entry to the Oswald slaying scene. • The Secret Service was deficient in performing its duties inconnection with the assassination. • The FBI performed with varying degrees of competency and failed toinvestigate adequately the possibility of conspiracy. • The CIA was deficient in its collection and sharing ofassassination information. • The Warren Commission failed to investigate the idea of conspiracyadequately, partly because of the failure of government agencies to provide theCommission with relevant information. • Investigation of conspiracy by the Secret Service was terminatedprematurely by President Johnson’s order that the FBI assume investigativeresponsibility. • Since the military 201 file on Oswald was destroyed before thecommittee could view it, the question of Oswald’s affiliation with militaryintelligence could not be fully resolved.All of these startling conclusions—and this was the “understated case.”The committee ended by recommending that the Justice Department pick up where itleft off and attempt to unravel the conspiracy that led to the deaths of John F.Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The only action on the part of Justice was theRamsey panel, which called into question the acoustical evidence of multiplegunmen. The panel’s conclusions were themselves called into question in apeer-reviewed scientific paper published in 2001.An internal Justice Department memo made public only in 1988 revealed whatresearchers had suspected all along—despite the findings and requests by theHouse committee, Justice officials had let the whole thing drop.It should be noted that in 1999, the King family won a wrongful death civil casein which they claimed King had been the victim of an assassination conspiracyinvolving the Memphis police as well as federal agencies. This jury verdictaffirmed the innocence of James Earl Ray and awarded the King family theirsought sum of $100, evidence they were not pursuing financial gain. Thisgroundbreaking story received scant coverage in the corporate mass media."},{"pageContent":"The Oliver Stone Film JFK [Contents.html#rch18]Public awareness of the Kennedy assassination conundrum was expanded worldwidein 1991 with the release of the $40 million film JFK, directed by the alreadycontroversial director Oliver Stone.To understand the movie, one must consider the words of its director. Stone toldthis author, “I am not making a documentary. I am making a movie.” The film wasa Herculean effort, distilling more than a thousand hours of film containing JFKassassination facts and information into slightly more than three hours.Despite being lambasted as “absurd” and “untrue” by the corporate mass mediaeven prior to its release, the film galvanized both sides of the conspiracyargument. Researchers who had been claiming a conspiracy in Kennedy’s death sawvindication in the movie while lone-assassin advocates held the film up as anexercise in presenting unsupported theories.The film was based on two primary sources—former New Orleans district attorneyJim Garrison’s book On the Trail of the Assassins, his account of the Clay Shawprosecution, and the 1989 edition of this book, Crossfire: The Plot That KilledKennedy.But Stone was not content to simply use the writings of others. He alsoorganized an entire research team coordinated by Harvard and Yale graduate JaneRusconi, who studied more than two hundred books on the subject. Rusconi’s teamalso reinterviewed some of the same people and reviewed the same documents asthis author. Interestingly enough, she and her team came to the same conclusionsespoused by both Garrison and this author.Despite a slow start, the film eventually built a huge international audience,which must have created concern within the circles of those who wished thetroublesome and unanswered questions about the assassination would simply goaway. The response of the mass media was mixed, with news commentators callingit fictionalized trash while movie reviewers gave it high marks.Preemptive Attacks [Contents.html#rsec91]Harsh criticism of the film began months even before it was first screened, withthe leaking of a first draft. The script went through almost a dozen draftsbefore being finalized. But this did not slow the media attack dogs. The filmwas excoriated by the Chicago Tribune, the Washington Post, and Time magazine.But at least those critics had actually viewed the picture. National PublicRadio’s Cokie Roberts, daughter of Warren Commission member Hale Boggs, refusedto even view it.Others were more open-minded. In 2010 Stephen Rosenfeld, senior editorial writerfor the Washington Post, noted, “That the assassination probably encompassedmore than a lone gunman now seems beyond cavil [quibbling about].”If there was more than one gunman, it follows that there was a conspiracy ofsome sort and it follows that the Warren Commission was incorrect. It shouldfollow also that journalists writing about the Kennedy assassination should bemore interested in what actually did happen than in dismissing every WarrenCommission critic as a paranoid. Yet, from the start, the media has consistentlypromoted the thesis that Rosenfeld now says is wrong beyond cavil.The experience of Pat Dowell, film critic for the Washingtonian, provided anexample of the break between film critics and corporate bosses. Her review forthe January 1992 issue was rejected by her editor, John Limpert, who said hedidn’t want a positive review for a film he felt was “preposterous.” Dowellresigned in protest.In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert named JFK as Best Pictureof the Year, writing, “The achievement of the film is not that it answers themystery of the Kennedy assassination, because it does not, or even that itvindicates Garrison, who is seen here as a man often whistling in the dark. Itsachievement is that it tries to marshal the anger which ever since 1963 has beengnawing away on some dark shelf of the national psyche.”While the film went to great lengths to reenact the assassination scenes asauthentically as possible—at the last moment some old Harley-Davidsonmotorcycles were located to re-create the motorcade’s police escort—the scriptprompted complaints of fictionalization by using composite characters andcondensing events and dialogue.For example, in the film Garrison travels to Washington meet with a mysterious“Mr. X,” who gives him insider information regarding the assassination. Thischaracter largely represented Colonel Fletcher Prouty, who indeed told thesethings to Garrison but only long after the Clay Shaw trial. In truth, at thetime of the trial Garrison went to Washington to meet with Army intelligenceagent Richard Case Nagell. To say Nagell said all this would have beenuntruthful, just as saying Prouty met Garrison at the time of the trial wouldhave been equally untruthful. So both men were turned into “Mr. X,” whonevertheless spoke the truth.One unreported event during the film’s shooting in Dallas indicated thatProvidence was watching over Stone’s production. One day when filming of themotorcade paused, a couple dozen extras who had been standing in the middle ofHouston Street moved to the Texas School Book Depository curb to get out of thehot Texas sun. High above them, technicians were mounting a camera on theseventh floor of the building. The Sixth Floor Museum had refused to allow Stoneto film from the actual sixth-floor window, most probably because it would haveshown that there is no clear line of sight to Elm Street due to evergreen treesin the way. Suddenly a huge glass windowpane came loose and fell down toward thecrowd of extras standing on the curb below. Fortunately, a gust of wind caughtthe pane at the last moment, causing it to slide sideways, crashing into thecenter of Houston Street, just vacated by the crowd. The pile of shattered glasswas quickly swept up and filming continued. Many people on the set, includingsome of the endangered extras, did not even realize that disaster had beenaverted.Despite acceptance by both film critics and most of the public, the debunkingefforts continued well into the next decade. Former Los Angeles prosecutorVincent Bugliosi, in his 2007 1,600-page opus on the assassination, wrote thefilm was “virtually a continuous lie.” He claimed, “JFK, the movie aboutGarrison’s prosecution of [Clay] Shaw, has caused far more damage to the truthabout the case than perhaps any single event other than Ruby’s killing ofOswald, which the American people widely view as an act by Ruby to ‘silence’Oswald.”Bugliosi voiced concern that more Americans would believe the CIA-LBJ-Pentagonplot by Stone than the Warren Commission’s lone-assassin theory. Bugliosi evenargued with himself over the merits of denigrating the film, explaining,“Serious non-fiction books don’t stoop to the discussion of wild fairy tales,which the movie JFK is.” He nevertheless stooped to trash the film for severalmore pages, referring to Stone’s sources as “kooks and nuts.”The prosecutor of Charles Manson made it quite clear in his tome that he felt“the various conspiracy theories [in the JFK assassination] are utterly vapidand bankrupt. . . . Oswald, a lone nut, killed Kennedy and was thereafter killedby another lone nut, Ruby. Two small men who wanted to become big, andsucceeded.”Bugliosi, whose book should have been titled Reclaiming the Warren Commission,offered the same tortured logic as that discredited commission. He wrote thatafter all the years, there was no credible evidence (emphasis his) of anyconspiracy, without justifying his interpretation of “credible.” It would appearthat anyone who agreed with his views was credible, while those who differedwere not credible.His work is a classic example of the debate method termed “appeal fromauthority,” in which fallacious arguments are presented from a real or imaginedauthoritarian source. For example, he stated there is no evidence of Oswald’sbeing “seen getting in a car after the shooting in Dealey Plaza” despite notingthat two motorists, Roy Cooper and Marvin C. Robinson, supported deputy RogerCraig’s claim of seeing Oswald leave the book depository in a Nash Ramblerstation wagon. Yet Bugliosi confidently wrote, “In any case, we can be certainhe [Craig] was wrong because we already know where Oswald was at the time.”He also offered the old argument that a conspiracy could not be kept secret.Here, Bugliosi fails to mention that numerous people, from organized-crimebosses to intelligence operatives, have indeed spoken out over the years about aconspiracy or that more than 25,000 government employees were able to keep theatomic bomb Manhattan Project a secret until one was detonated over Hiroshima,Japan.Historian and education consultant Grover B. Proctor Jr., widely acknowledged asan expert on the assassination of President Kennedy, said, “If Stone’s film,based on the cumulative efforts of many researchers, shows a distrust of andbias against the government’s involvement and the media’s cover-up, there issome justification.” He explained:Stone has been quoted widely about his attempt in this film to “fictionalize”the assassination, and to create a new mythology of the event. It is a poor, iftechnically accurate, choice of words. Those most closely wedded to the officialversion have leapt on this and said, “See? Didn’t we tell you? There is no truthhere and he admits it.” However, what he has done is more subtle and literarilypermissible than this simplistic response. In “fictionalizing” the story, Stonehas collapsed long, laborious facts, witness lists, and theories into one speechor one character, a time-honored device dating to Shakespeare and beyond.Proctor summed up the feelings of many on both sides of the conspiracy argumentwhen he concluded, “The Great Debate over the film will rage on for a while, andeach side will continue to vilify the integrity, accomplishments, andmotivations of the other. But when the smoke has cleared, the questions posed bythe film will still be on the table for resolution—not a bad end for ablockbuster Hollywood venture.”Noting that Stone’s film made public a possibility that most Americans had beenafraid to face—that the assassination was the result of a coup by the USmilitary-industrial-intelligence complex—Proctor added, “The chilling thing isthat the solution presented by JFK may also be very close to exactly whathappened.”"},{"pageContent":"The Assassinations Records Review Board [Contents.html#rch19]Whether perceived as ground truth or Hollywood fiction, the film JFK producedenough renewed public interest in the assassination that Congress was spurredinto action. The public outcry over the film and sealed assassination recordsresulted in the passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination RecordsCollection Act, signed by president George H. W. Bush on October 26, 1992. Theact, designed to restore government credibility, called for the creation of atemporary Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). This independent agencyreviewed and later released to the National Archives nearly 5 million pages ofonce-secret JFK assassination records.The board began its work in 1994 and finished in the fall of 1998, although thefurther declassification of government records continued afterward. The ARRB wasto be composed of five citizens with a background in history, archives, and thelaw who were not government employees. They and their staff held high-levelsecurity clearances and were able to seek out heretofore classified documentswithin government agencies. Board members were to have been named within ninetydays of passage of the act but there was an eighteen-month delay due to thetransition between the Bush and Clinton administrations.In the executive summary of the ARRB’s final report, this creation of theEstablishment nevertheless described the JFK assassination as an “inexplicableact” shrouded in “secrecy and mystery.” The avowed intention of the ARRB was topenetrate this mystery but it failed to produce a solution to the case.Board member Kermit Hall explained:The Review Board is a unique and, in many ways, unprecedented institution inAmerican history. . . . Never before has a group of private citizens been giventhe opportunity to bring some order to the record of one great historical event.The Board, we should remember, is not charged with answering the question of whomurdered President Kennedy. It is not running an investigation; it is, instead,seeking to disclose documents in an age of open secrets, an age in which we havecome to embrace the idea that openness is to be preferred and thataccountability is the touchstone for public confidence in government.Hall prophetically stated when the ARRB closed shop, it could take ten yearsbefore its work could be adequately analyzed and evaluated.Despite the conclusion of conspiracy by the House committee and the massiveamount of documents the board uncovered, Minnesota federal district judge JackTunheim, who headed the ARRB, continued to support the Warren Commission bystating that after viewing the available evidence, he had not seen any directproof to change the verdict that Lee Harvey Oswald committed the act alone.While most board members have remained coy about their opinions and conclusionsbased on their ARRB work, at least one staff member dissented from Tunheim’sWarren Commission support.Douglas Horne’s Discoveries [Contents.html#rsec92]Douglas P. Horne, the chief analyst for military records for ARRB, wrote moreextensively about discrepancies and outright confabulation in the medicalevidence, fakery in the Zapruder film, and the deliberate destruction of SecretService records in his 2009 book set, Inside the Assassination Records ReviewBoard.Horne, who wrote that his work with the ARRB did not begin with the idea ofpublishing a book, pulled no punches in his five volumes. In his overly detaileddescription and analysis of his experience on the board, he wrote, “Let me makeit clear here and now that I consider the assassination of President Kennedy tohave been an action of the state [emphasis his]: the national securityestablishment made a decision late in 1962 or early in 1963 to fire thePresident, and it was a broad consensus.”A former Navy navigator, Horne got to the crux of the case by detailing thetainting of the physical evidence, both by suppression and by fabrication. Henoted:Once the researcher is convinced that the President was killed by multipleshooters in a crossfire—and through this, understands that he was killed by aconspiracy—the precise details of how that shooting occurred become irrelevant.Of equal or greater importance than understanding that President Kennedy waskilled by a crossfire, is understanding that the Federal government covered upthe facts of his death, in the most brazen and outrageous manipulation ofphysical evidence in any murder case in American history.He added that the mere fact that no one in government has admitted the truth ofthe assassination is the surest indication that the cover-up was sinister innature. “If the cover-up had been a benign one, it would have been admitted to,and fully explained, long ago,” he reasoned.Based on the testimony of Bethesda Naval Hospital technicians and photographers,Horne was able to confirm the claims of author David Lifton that surgery wasconducted on Kennedy’s body prior to the official autopsy, the X-rays andautopsy photographs now in the National Archives are not the originals, andJFK’s body arrived in circumstances different from the official account.Kennedy’s body left Dallas wrapped in a sheet inside a costly bronze coffin, yetarrived at Bethesda in a zippered body bag inside a plain military-styleshipping coffin. Horne noted, “The shipping casket and body bag witnesses fromBethesda provide medico-legal proof that the body was intercepted in transit,that its chain-of-custody was broken, and that there was an opportunity totamper with JFK’s wounds in transit.”Based on initial reports, including notes made by LBJ’s secretary aboard AirForce One, Kennedy’s body was to have been sent to Walter Reed Army MedicalCenter rather than Bethesda. Horne explained:The original intent of the conspirators seems to have been to reunite thePresident’s body with the empty Dallas casket at Walter Reed . . . and then takethe Dallas casket, with the body inside it once again, to Bethesda. This planwas foiled by the President’s widow, who refused a helicopter ride back to theWhite House, and instead insisted on remaining with the Dallas casket all theway to Bethesda Naval Hospital. This decision of hers, which no one couldcountermand, created major problems for those in charge of the cover-up who hadbeen planning to quietly reintroduce JFK’s body back into the Dallas casket atWalter Reed. It . . . created unwanted witnesses to multiple casket entries atBethesda, and to the broken chain-of-custody for the body.Horne also was able to confirm reports that the autopsy was controlled not bythe medical personnel, but by military authorities crowded into the autopsyroom. When the doctors started to examine Kennedy’s throat wound, first thoughtto mark a tracheotomy and only later revealed as a bullet wound, according towitnesses, it was Admiral Calvin Galloway, Bethesda’s commanding officer, whotold them, “Leave it alone. Don’t touch it. It’s just a tracheotomy.”Horne found that the lead autopsist, Navy Commander Dr. James J. Humes,dissembled about a number of things including the time that Kennedy’s bodyarrived at Bethesda. He said based on official reports, Humes’s WarrenCommission testimony that the body arrived at 7:35 p.m. was “intentionallymisleading, deliberately off by an hour.”According to witness Paul O’Connor, Humes was “scared to death” during theautopsy. Horne said this was “no wonder” as “Humes had been involved inobstruction of justice, in a grisly charade forced upon him by his militarysuperiors in order to create a dishonest photographic and x-ray record, and wasabout to reveal the questionable results of his handiwork to a morgue packedwith over 35 visitors, many of them of Flag rank.”Bethesda technician James Jenkins described the JFK autopsy as a “circus” andsaid that Humes was being carefully directed through the procedure by Dr. GeorgeBurkley, the president’s personal physician, through Admiral Galloway. Jenkinsadded, “People need to understand that this was a cover-up. For what reason, Ican only speculate, but certainly the evidence—presented by Humes to thepublic—was not the evidence we found at the autopsy.”Horne also demonstrated that Dr. Burkley was untruthful in several statements hemade to both the Warren Commission and the later House committee. “If he werealive today, he would be subject to prosecution for perjury,” noted Horne.The Zapruder Film: Fundamental or Fraud? [Contents.html#rsec93]Over the years, many serious researchers have questioned the authenticity of thefamous Abraham Zapruder film. Horne dealt extensively with the famous Zapruderfilm in his volumes because, he wrote, assessing the legitimacy of the filmcould lead to a better understanding of what really happened.Like most Americans, Horne had initially accepted the film as legitimateevidence in the assassination. But in June 1997, he said the ARRB staff “becameaware of evidence that pointed toward the possible creation of a modifiedversion of the Zapruder film the weekend of the assassination at Kodak’s mainindustrial plant in Rochester, New York.”Horne wrote, “Throughout that summer, I became painfully aware that asking Kodakto perform an authenticity study of the Zapruder film for the ARRB (and the factthat Kodak agreed to do so on a pro bono basis, free of charge!) constituted apotential conflict of interest of major proportions.”Because of both time and financial considerations, Kodak was allowed to continuewith the authenticity study, conducted by Rollie Zavada, a former Kodak employeecalled out of retirement. However, his report was presented only five daysbefore the ARRB ceased operation, leaving no time for questions or furtherstudy. Furthermore, while the Zavada study listed some characteristicsindicating the film was an original, it also carried technical language andexhibits that some, including Horne, felt cast doubt on the film’s authenticity.Confusion over how and where the Zapruder film was processed began immediately.Originally taken by Secret Service agent in charge Forrest Sorrels and reporterHarry McCormack to WFAA television station for processing, they found thestation was not equipped to develop 8 mm color film. So the film was taken tothe Eastman Kodak Company plant that was already processing the colortransparencies of witness Phil Willis. Both Sorrels and Willis recalled that theZapruder film was processed at the Kodak plant but a December 1963 FBI reportfrom agent Robert Barrett quoted Zapruder as saying the processing took place atthe Jamieson Film Company on Bryan Street.A more serious question concerning the legitimacy of the Zapruder film stemmedfrom revelations out of the 1975 President’s Commission on CIA Activities headedby then–vice president Nelson Rockefeller. In response to requests from theCommission, the CIA admitted that the agency’s National PhotographicInterpretation Center (NPIC) had performed a shot and timing analysis of thefilm, shot internegatives of the film, performed a print test, produced threeprint copies (the exact number of copies reported after the assassinationweekend), and created four briefing board panels displaying twenty-eightenlargements of frames from the film. It is unclear exactly when all thisinvolvement with the Zapruder film took place except that it was done beforemid-December 1963 and apparently even took place prior to the film’s beingturned over to Time-Life on Monday, November 25, 1963. If this was the case, itwas altered before anyone—at either Time-Life or the government—got to view it.Such early covert handling of the Zapruder film led some assassinationresearchers to believe the government, in the form of the CIA’s NPIC, may havedoctored the film long before anyone in the public got to see it. Author RichardTrask commented, “The available records, unfortunately, give us scantinformation as to what in fact the CIA or NPIC did with the analyzing of thefilm.”Trask apparently was unfamiliar with Homer A. McMahon, who in 1963 was managerof NPIC’s color lab, and his assistant Morgan Bennett Hunter, as neither wasmentioned in his book. In 1997 this pair, located and interviewed by the ARRB,revealed that the Zapruder film indeed was worked on at NPIC the weekend of theassassination. McMahon also recalled that the film was flown from Dallas to astate-of-the-art CIA-funded Kodak lab in Rochester, New York, where it wasactually developed rather than in Dallas. He remembered the film was brought toNPIC by a “Bill Smith” of the Secret Service from Rochester, although no suchagent could later be found. Smith told McMahon he personally had obtained thefilm from the amateur who exposed it (apparently Abraham Zapruder), flew it toRochester for developing, and then ferried it to the Washington Navy Yard forthe NPIC work. Hunter later recalled a Secret Service agent being present alongwith a military captain named Sands. Smith ordered both Hunter and McMahon neverto discuss their work with the film and to refer any queries to Captain Sands.McMahon also told the ARRB that he and Hunter worked with the film Smithprovided to produce blowups of approximately forty frames. He added that thefilm was never copied as a motion picture. Only selected frames were blown up toproduce the briefing or presentation panels. McMahon added that although heconducted no official analysis, it was his opinion at the time that Kennedy wasshot six to eight times from three separate locations. But he said Smith arguedthere were only three shots from behind and “you can’t fight city hall.”In 2003, Kodak’s Zavada wrote, “There is no detectable evidence of manipulationor image alteration on the ‘Zapruder in-camera original’ and all supportingevidence precludes any forgery thereto. The film that exists at NARA [theNational Archives and Records Administration] was received from Time/Life, hasall the characteristics of an original film per my report.”But the issue of alterations remains unsettled. Recall that the Dallassurveyors, Robert West and Chester Breneman, said they conducted their survey ofDealey Plaza on the morning of November 25, 1963, with the use ofeight-by-ten-inch color photo prints of the Zapruder film frames. While it hasbeen truthfully argued that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to retoucha tiny 8 mm movie frame, it would be simple to blow up each frame toeight-by-ten-inch size, perform some retouching, and reshoot the framesindividually. When run as a moving film, especially if reshot with the originalcamera, it would be most difficult to detect alterations.The evidence indicates that the Zapruder film manipulated at NPIC was not eventhe real film. “If McMahon was correct that he had viewed the original,16mm-wide, unslit double 8 movie film the weekend of the assassination, and ifit was really developed in Rochester at a CIA lab run by Kodak (as he wasunambiguously told it was), then the extant film . . . is not a camera originalfilm, but a simulated ‘original’ created with an optical printer at the CIA’ssecret film lab in Rochester,” explained Horne.In 2009 Peter Janney, author of the revealing book on JFK confidante MaryPinchot Meyer, Mary’s Mosaic, interviewed at length Dino Brugioni, former headof NPIC’s Information Branch. Brugioni recalled participating in the NPICproduction of assassination briefing boards using an original Zapruder film onNovember 23, 1963, the day after the assassination. These boards reportedly wereordered by the Secret Service but delivered to CIA director John McCone. OnDecember 9, 1963, based on analysis of the boards, McCone told Robert Kennedy“two people were involved in the shooting.” McCone attempted to show thisevidence to President Johnson but was brushed off. In the 1990s, the CIA finallyturned over some of the briefing boards to the ARRB.Brugioni identified “Captain Sands” as Navy Captain Pierre Sands, who served asdeputy director of NPIC, and described the CIA-backed Kodak lab in Rochester,known as the “Hawkeye Plant,” as a facility that “had everything” including anoptical printer, a film printer used for making optical effects through the useof special lenses and a projector to transfer images to film stock, and, infact, “had the capability to do almost anything.”Additional proof of government manipulation of the Zapruder film prior to itspurchase by Time-Life on November 25, 1963, came from Hollywood special effectsexperts.Hollywood Takes a Look [Contents.html#rsec94]In 2008, Sydney Wilkinson, with more than twenty years’ experience in theHollywood postproduction industry, became intrigued by the Zapruder film. Shewas surprised to learn there had never been a nongovernmental scientific imagingstudy of its authenticity. After contacting the National Archives and RecordsAdministration and being given authorization by Dallas’s Sixth Floor Museum,which holds the Zapruder copyright, she obtained a certified third-generation35-millimeter “forensic version” (untouched) duplicate negative of the film.This was scanned directly to a 6K DPX digital form using a Northlight scanner,today considered state-of-the-art technology in feature-film postproduction. Thedigital file exactly replicates the film’s image and reveals all information ineach frame via 6144 by 4668 pixels. In comparison, home HD TV is only 1920 by1080 pixels.Wilkinson was stunned by what she found in the blown-up frames. “When I viewedthe frames following the head shot, I felt the hair stand up on the back of myneck,” she recalled. “In the frames that weren’t blurry—frames 317, 321, 323,and others—a solid black ‘patch’ on the rear of his head jumped out at me. Itwas clearly artificial.” Some believe this patch was painted on to mask themassive exit wound in the right rear portion of his head indicating a shot fromthe front.More than two dozen film industry professionals—special-effects artists, filmeditors, imaging specialists, and technical engineers, including restoration andpreservation professionals at major studios—evaluated the Zapruder frames andall perceived the painted patch on the rear of his head. “They are convincedthis black patch was artificial and not a natural shadow on the back of JFK’shead,” said Wilkinson.Ned Price, a film restoration expert at a major studio, exclaimed, “Oh, that’shorrible, that’s just terrible! That’s such a bad fake.” Paul R. Rutan Jr.,president and chief technician of a Hollywood film restoration company, noted,“We are not looking at opticals [original images]; we are looking at artwork.”Their observations were confirmed by others but most did not want their namesinvolved, such as the film expert who commented, “I am as convinced as I can bethat frame 317 is a man-made special effect placed there to deceive.”Leo Zahn, a director and cinematographer with thirty years’ experience includingextensive work with the standard 8 mm format of the 1960s and ‘70s, explained:In Frame 317, the shadow on the backside of JFK’s head looks like an artifactnot created by sunlight striking an object. This shadow with razor-sharp edgesand almost d-max (maximum film density) looks more like a patch. . . . Forcomparison I have pulled Frame 295 (1.5 seconds before Frame 317) where JFK’shead is in similar position to the sun, and here the shadow on the backside ofhis head looks the way it should on Kodachrome film.The ARRB’s Douglas Horne noted:The considered opinions of [these] professionals, who together have spent overfive decades restoring and working with films of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s(when visual effects were done optically—not digitally) in that one moment[have] superseded the statements of all those in the JFK research community whohave insisted for two decades now that the Zapruder film could not have beenaltered, because the technology did not exist to do so.But the evidence of alteration aside, other problems remain with the historicfilm. Trask, Horne, and most assassination researchers agree that contrary tothe popular opinion that the Zapruder film represents photographic historictruth, just like any other photo, it merely captures a brief period of time andis actually subjective, open to the viewer’s interpretation. “The fact [is] thatthe different possible interpretations of the Zapruder film—even if we assumethat the extant film is the authentic camera original film—are almost endless,and are not getting simpler with the passage of years,” noted Horne.So now, along with fake government documents and phony autopsy X-rays andphotographs, the public must understand that even the Zapruder film, longheralded as the ultimate truth of the assassination, cannot be accepted at facevalue.[images/line.jpg]Jack Tunheim, by 2012 a Minnesota federal district judge, said all but a few ofthe JFK assassination documents are now public. “Is there a cache of recordssomeplace? I don’t think so. We looked as far and as wide as we possibly could,”proclaimed Tunheim to a Minnesota news station. “It would have been a violationof law to not turn over records to us for our decision making. I just don’tthink there was much left.” Tunheim said that after many years of seeing all theavailable evidence—from Oswald’s rifle and bullets, to Kennedy’s autopsy photos,to FBI and CIA documents—he has not seen any direct evidence of any kind tochange the verdict, which is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.However, researchers claim many thousands of records, especially CIA documents,are still being withheld.Researcher and historian William E. Kelly Jr., one of the founders of theCoalition on Political Assassinations, in an open letter to Judge Tunheim in2012, wrote:It was with deep regret and some indignation that I read your comments regardingthe JFK Assassination records that remain withheld, their numbers and the lackof any other cache of records someplace. . . . In fact, all the evidence isn’t“out there” and there are many thousands of records, especially CIA documentsthat are still being withheld, so many in fact that the National Archives andRecords Administration (NARA) can’t count them or say exactly how many.Kelly said the National Archives estimates that 1 percent of the known recordsstill remain classified, which would mean there are still an estimated 50,000still-secret records. Not a few, there are so many they can’t even tell you howmany documents are still sealed or how many pages are being withheld, andthey’re not going to count them until they are required to do so. Kelly said:Just among the CIA records alone, there are over 1,000 documents identified bythe ARRB that are currently locked in a sealed vault at the Archives II facilityin College Park, Maryland, and are scheduled to be released to the public in2017, but are expected to remain sealed indefinitely at the request of the CIA.According to some reports, the CIA has already identified the documents thatthey intend to ask the president to postpone beyond 2017.Some assassination records were destroyed even after the ARRB was formed toobtain them. Page 149 [Chapter005.html#page_149] of the ARRB’s final reportdryly noted:Congress passed the JFK Act in [October] 1992. One month later, the SecretService began its compliance efforts. However, in January 1995, the SecretService destroyed Presidential protection survey reports for some of PresidentKennedy’s trips in the fall of 1963. The Review Board learned of the destructionapproximately one week after the Secret Service destroyed them, when the Boardwas drafting its request for additional information. The Board believed that theSecret Service files on the President’s travels in the weeks preceding hismurder would be relevant.The website JFK Facts, moderated by former Washington Post reporter JeffersonMorley, described the JFK assassination as “the key political and historicalissue of our time.” The site noted:The JFK Records Act, passed unanimously in 1992, is no longer being enforced.Since the Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB) dissolved in 1998, itsrecommendations have gone unheeded, especially the one requesting that thehistorical and archival associations that recommended them continue to conductoversight of the law. Congress has failed to hold any oversight hearings on theJFK Act in over 15 years and shows no inclination to do so.Far from closed, the JFK assassination case continues to raise even morequestions. JFK Facts asked:If JFK was killed by a deranged lone nut, why are so many records from 1963considered so significant in 2012? Why were records destroyed? Who ordered theirdestruction? Where are the Air Force One tapes? Why can’t they be found? Why areso many CIA documents about undercover officers with pre-assassination knowledgeof Lee Harvey Oswald classified for reasons of national security? Why doesn’tCongress oversee the JFK Records Act? Why don’t they hold public hearings onthese issues and get answers to these questions?Such questions prompted former-Minnesota-governor-turned–TV personality JesseVentura to reason, “If the government were telling the truth, there would be noreason to lock up anything from the people of this country. Clearly they arenot, because here we are 50 years later, and they are still withholdingdocuments from us.”Researcher William Kelly concluded, “Today, the American government is afraid ofits people, afraid to enforce its own laws and afraid to allow its citizens toknow the complete truth about the assassination of President Kennedy. Suchcomplete truth must involve the term ‘coup d’état.’”"},{"pageContent":"A Question of Oswald [Contents.html#rch20]One of the most intriguing yet misunderstood issues surrounding the JFKassassination involves questions about the identity of Lee Harvey Oswald. Thisissue can be broken into two segments—one is the evidence pointing to someoneimpersonating Oswald in the weeks prior to the assassination, and the secondconcerns the identity of the man Jack Ruby killed.This whole question of Oswald doppelgangers—or lookalikes—is admittedly bizarre.However, the evidence suggesting such duplication is considerable.Questions about Oswald’s identity did not suddenly surface years after theassassination, as many people believe. Recall that J. Edgar Hoover expressedconcern over Oswald’s identity as far back as June 3, 1960, when he warned theState Department against an Oswald impostor.Despite assurances by government agencies at the time of the assassination thatthey were unaware of Oswald or his background, there is now evidence that peoplewithin the government were checking frequently on the ex-Marine long before theassassination.On March 31, 1961, the deputy chief of the Passport Office wrote to the ConsularSection of the State Department regarding Oswald, stating:This file contains information first, which indicates that mail from the motherof this boy is not being delivered to him and second, that it has been statedthat there is an impostor using Oswald’s identification data and that no doubtthe Soviets would love to get hold of his valid passport, it is my opinion thatthe passport should be delivered to him only on a personal basis and after theEmbassy is assured to its complete satisfaction that he is returning to theUnited States.Another State Department communication, this time to the US embassy in Moscow,on July 11, 1961, stated, “The Embassy’s careful attention to the involved caseof Mr. Oswald is appreciated. It is assumed that there is no doubt that theperson who has been in communication with the Embassy is the person who wasissued a passport in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald.”Contrary to the public announcements, government officials were keenly aware ofOswald. Only two weeks before the assassination, someone signing for the StateDepartment checked out Oswald’s file from military records.The New Orleans FBI office apparently kept close tabs on Oswald while he was inthat city and then shipped its file on him to Dallas in the fall of 1963, whereagent James Hosty tried to reach Oswald. At the same time, a militaryintelligence unit in Texas was receiving information on Oswald for its files.An Impostor [Contents.html#rsec95]After the assassination, literally hundreds of people claimed to have seenOswald in the days preceding the tragedy. This outpouring of sightings is normalin a case of this magnitude. While this phenomenon is to be expected, manyreputable people encountered a Lee Harvey Oswald at a time when Oswald wasreported elsewhere and whose stories cannot be easily dismissed.However, the Warren Commission found it easy enough to dismiss these people. TheCommission’s rationale was simple: if someone saw Oswald at a time when theCommission had determined him to be elsewhere, then the observer was mistaken inhis identification.One such encounter with a bogus Oswald is especially intriguing since itoccurred long before Oswald reportedly arrived back in the United States fromhis sojourn in Russia. Oscar Deslatte, manager of a Ford dealership in NewOrleans, contacted the FBI immediately after the assassination. He told thebureau that a man identifying himself as “Joseph Moore” had tried to buy tentrucks on January 10, 1961. He said the man was accompanied by a Cuban and hadsaid he wanted Deslatte to “give a good price because we’re doing this for thegood of the country.” At this time the CIA and its Cuban allies were preparingfor the April 17 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba.Deslatte said “Moore” asked that the name “Oswald” be placed on the purchaseestimate sheet. The man said “Oswald” would be paying for the trucks on behalfof an anti-Castro Cuban organization.In 1979, the FBI released a copy of Deslatte’s estimate sheet and it showed theanti-Castro organization involved was “Friends of Democratic Cuba,” which justhappened to have been the anti-Castro group that included in its membershipex-FBI agent Guy Banister. Banister, of course, was the fervent anti-Castroagent who was connected to Oswald in the summer of 1963 at 544 Camp Street.Another story involves testimony heard by the Senate Intelligence Committee froma former immigration inspector in New Orleans. While keeping the man’s identitysecret, the committee reported:He is absolutely certain that he interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald in a New Orleansjail cell sometime shortly before April 1, 1963. Although the inspector is notnow certain whether Oswald was using that particular name at that time, he iscertain that Oswald was claiming to be a Cuban alien. He quickly ascertainedthat Oswald was not a Cuban alien, at which point he left Oswald in his jailcell.According to the Warren Commission, Oswald did not arrive in New Orleans untilthe end of April, nearly a month after the inspector’s meeting with the jailed“Oswald.”During his time in New Orleans, Oswald was seen in many and varying situations.He was handing out pro-Castro literature on New Orleans streets, while at thesame time approaching anti-Castro Cuban leaders with proposals to help traintheir followers.Some of the people who encountered Oswald in New Orleans described him as aclean and well-kept, courteous young man, while others said he was dirty anddisheveled and a swearing hard drinker. It is difficult to believe these peoplewere talking about the same individual.As the assassination drew closer, the strange reports of second Oswalds began toincrease.On September 25, 1963, Mrs. Lee Dannelly, an official with the Selective Servicesystem in Austin, Texas, reported that a young man came to her office for help.He said his name was Harvey Oswald and that he wished to get his militarydischarge with “other than honorable conditions” changed to an honorabledischarge. The man said he was living in Fort Worth. Dannelly said she couldfind no such person in her files and she told the man to check with SelectiveService in Fort Worth. She next saw Oswald on television after the assassinationand promptly reported her experience. Oswald did have a dishonorable dischargeand he had lived in Fort Worth, but on September 25, he was on his way to MexicoCity, according to the Warren Commission.After the assassination, some residents of Irving said they recalled Oswaldthere. Leonard Hutchinson of Hutch’s Market came forward to say that he had beenasked to cash a check for Oswald earlier in November. He said on one occasionthis man, accompanied by a young woman, spoke in some foreign language.Hutchinson said he recognized both Oswald and Marina when their photographs werebroadcast over television after the assassination. Near Hutchinson’s store was abarbershop where a man identified as Oswald went for haircuts. The barber alsosaid he saw the same man entering Hutchinson’s store. Despite all this, theWarren Commission concluded, “Oswald is not known to have received a check forthis amount from any source. . . . Examination of Hutchinson’s testimonyindicates a more likely explanation is that Oswald was not in his store at all.”Next is the well-documented story of Oswald’s wild car ride weeks before theassassination. Albert G. Bogard, a salesman for Downtown Lincoln-Mercury, justwest of the Triple Underpass in Dealey Plaza, told the Warren Commission thatbefore the assassination—“the ninth day of November, I think it was, to beexact”—a man came into the dealership and introduced himself as “Lee Oswald” andindicated he wanted to purchase a Lincoln Continental. Bogard told theCommission:I show him a car on the showroom floor, and take him for a ride out StemmonsExpressway and back, and he was driving at 60 to 70 miles an hour and came backto the showroom. And, I made some figures and he told me he wasn’t ready to buy,that he would be in a couple or three weeks, that he had some money coming in.And when he finally started to leave I got his name and wrote it on the back ofone of my business cards, and never heard from the man any more.Bogard said on the day of the assassination, he heard Oswald had been arrestedand threw away the business card with Oswald’s name on it, saying, “He won’t bea prospect anymore because he is going to jail.” His story was supported by twoother dealership employees, Eugene Wilson and Frank Pizzo.However, the Warren Commission concluded:Several persons who knew Oswald have testified that he was unable to drive,although Mrs. Paine, who was giving Oswald driving lessons, stated that Oswaldwas showing some improvement by November. Moreover, Oswald’s whereabouts onNovember 9, as testified to by Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine, would have made itimpossible for him to have visited the automobile showrooms as Mr. Bogardclaims.In a 1977 Dallas Morning News story, Wilson said the FBI and the WarrenCommission dismissed the story of Oswald’s drive because they had it occurringon November 9.Wilson told the newspaper the man was Oswald and that he did know how to driveand that the incident actually occurred on November 2, a more plausible date. Healso said he recalled that when Oswald was turned down for a credit purchase, hesaid, “Maybe I’m going to have to go back to Russia to buy a car.” Wilson saidhe could pinpoint the date because later the day of Oswald’s drive, he used thesame car to carry his wife and some friends home after a meeting of the LoneStar Bulldog Club. Wilson said the next day at a Dallas dog show he won someribbons that carried the date.The Warren Commission indeed published a copy of an unsigned application for aTexas driver’s license in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald.If the car buyer was Oswald, he was expecting to come into money at the exacttime of the assassination. If it wasn’t Oswald, it was an impostor.Recall the incident involving C. A. Hamblen, the night manager of Western Unionin Dallas, who told of Oswald collecting money orders during the early part ofNovember. Another Western Union employee, Aubrey Lee Lewis, said he recalled aman resembling Oswald as a “feminine, very slender-built fellow” who wasinvolved with a small money order to the Dallas YMCA and was accompanied by a“man of Spanish descent.” The man used a “little Navy ID release card” and alibrary card for identification.This story of Oswald receiving money just before the assassination caused aminor uproar within both the Warren Commission and Western Union. WesternUnion’s officials were quick to remind employees that they were not to discusscustomers or their money orders or amounts. It is apparent that the WesternUnion employees were under pressure not to tell more about the money orderincidents.A check by Western Union failed to turn up any money orders in the name of LeeHarvey Oswald. But if it was not the Marine Oswald using a Navy ID and librarycard to receive money orders, then who was it? The Warren Commission apparentlywas unable to find out.It is interesting to note the Western Union workers mentioned someone theybelieved to be Oswald sending money orders to the Dallas YMCA.According to the Warren Commission, “Oswald did not contact his wife immediatelywhen he returned to Dallas [supposedly from a trip to Mexico City in lateSeptember 1963]. . . . He spent the night at the [Dallas] YMCA, where heregistered as a serviceman in order to avoid paying the membership fee.”YMCA records showed an Oswald staying there on October 3 and 4. The records alsoindicated that Oswald lived at the YMCA between October 15 and 19, 1962.The Dallas YMCA also had a member who frequented its health-club facilitiesquite often during this time—Jack Ruby.Dallas police saw a man resembling Oswald handing out pro-Castro literature ondowntown streets in the months preceding the assassination. Was it reallyOswald? The Warren Commission had Oswald leafleting in New Orleans at the time.Then there are the strange incidents involving Oswald or someone resemblingOswald using a foreign-made rifle in the weeks preceding the assassination. OnNovember 1, a “rude and impertinent” man bought rifle ammunition in Morgan’sGunshop in nearby Fort Worth. Three people recalled this incident after theassassination and claimed the man was Oswald. The Warren Commission, however,determined that Oswald was elsewhere at the time.Dial Duwayne Ryder, the service manager at the Irving Sports Shop, recalledworking on a rifle but it was not an Italian weapon. He even gave the FBI anundated check stub for $6 that bore the name “Oswald.” The stub indicated thatwork done on the rifle was “drilling and tapping and boresighting.” Ryder saidthe work was probably done during the first two weeks of November.However, since there was a $1.50 charge for boresighting and the drilling andtapping was $1.50 per hole, it indicated to Ryder that three holes were drilledin the rifle for a telescopic sight.The Carcano identified as Oswald’s rifle had only two holes for the sight andthe telescopic sight came already fixed to the rifle. Furthermore, neither Rydernor his boss could readily identify pictures of Oswald as the man ordering thework. Thus it would appear that someone using Oswald’s name ordered work on aweapon that was not the Oswald rifle.The Warren Commission, never willing to admit the possibility that someone mighthave been fabricating evidence against Oswald, hinted that Ryder had made up thestory about working on the rifle.Again in early November, shooters at the Sports Drome Rifle Range recalled ayoung man who was there sighting in a foreign-made rifle. One of these shooters,Malcolm Price, helped adjust the rifle sight for the man shooting and another,Garland Slack, argued with the man on another occasion because the man wasshooting at Slack’s target. Both Dr. Homer Wood and his son, Sterling Wood,recalled the man and both were shocked to see his photograph on television inthe days following the assassination. They remained convinced the man was LeeHarvey Oswald.However, the Warren Commission noted that these witnesses were not consistent intheir descriptions of the rifle-range gunman or of the rifle and scope. Inaddition, some of the gun-range witnesses said Oswald was accompanied by a manin a late-model car. Since Oswald reportedly could not drive and did not knowanyone with a late-model car, the Commission concluded, “Although the testimonyof these witnesses was partially corroborated by other witnesses, there wasother evidence which prevented the Commission from reaching the conclusion thatLee Harvey Oswald was the person these witnesses saw.”Furthermore, Price remembered helping “Oswald” sight his rifle on September 28,1963, a time when Oswald reportedly was in Mexico City.In October 1963, Mrs. Lovell Penn heard shooting on her property just outsideDallas. Accosting three men shooting a rifle in a field, Penn ordered them toleave. After they left, she found a 6.5 mm Mannlicher-Carcano rifle shell nearwhere the men had been target shooting. After the assassination, she turned theshell casing over to the FBI and told them that one of the men looked likeOswald while another was “Latin, perhaps Cuban.” However, the FBI reported thatlaboratory tests showed the shell had not been fired from the Oswald rifle.The reports of Oswald accompanied by Cubans came from many different sources.Recall the incident of three anti-Castro Cubans—one by the name of LeonOswald—visiting Silvia Odio shortly before the assassination.Someone was posing as Oswald in the days preceding the assassination, carefullylaying out a pattern of an irritating young man who was in possession of andpracticing with a foreign-made rifle.But the Warren Commission stated, “In most instances, investigation hasdisclosed that there is no substantial basis for believing that the personreported by the various witnesses was Oswald.”Of course, if the man in question was not Oswald, it means that someone waslaying a trail of evidence to the real Oswald. This gives great credence toOswald’s cry to news reporters in the Dallas police station: “I’m just a patsy!”But the question of Oswald’s identity leads to even stranger areas.Was Oswald Really Oswald? [Contents.html#rsec96]Was the Oswald killed in Dallas the same Oswald born in New Orleans in 1939?Bizarre as this may sound, there is considerable evidence to suggest that theman killed by Ruby was not the original Lee Harvey Oswald.The first major publicity over this issue came in 1977 with the publication ofThe Oswald File by British author and attorney Michael Eddowes. Eddowes, whoacknowledged to this author his connections with British intelligence datingback to World War II, theorized, “Lee Harvey Oswald was captured by the Sovietsafter traveling to Russia in 1959 and a look-alike substitute was returned tothe United States in his place.”Eddowes said that after studying the issue of Oswald’s identity, he became “100percent convinced” that President Kennedy was killed by a Soviet KGB agentimpersonating the real Oswald. The British attorney noted the followingdiscrepancies to support his theory: • A mastoidectomy scar that was noted on Oswald’s Marine Corpsmedical records was not mentioned in Oswald’s autopsy report. • Oswald’s Marine records showed a vaccination scar on his arm,along with other scars. No vaccination scar was noted in Oswald’s autopsy reportand the location of scars differed from those in his military records. • In Warren Commission documents, including Marine and passportapplication papers, at least eleven give Oswald’s height as five-foot-eleven,while at least thirteen documents—all produced after Oswald’s return fromRussia—give his height as five-foot-nine. • During Oswald’s twenty-month disappearance in Russia, USgovernment agencies—including the FBI and the State Department—expressedsuspicions regarding Oswald’s identity. • When Marina met Oswald at a dance in Minsk, she believed him to bea native Russian with a Baltic area accent. Since there is no doubt that the manshe met in Russia was the man killed in Dallas, it should be understood thatMarina knew only the one Oswald. But this fact does not eliminate thepossibility that a substitution took place prior to their meeting.There are a number of other intriguing hints that point toward substitution.Just weeks before leaving Russia for home, Oswald wrote his mother and asked herto send him pictures of her and himself. Some researchers wonder if he neededsuch photos so he would know which woman to greet at the airport.Jeanne DeMohrenschildt claimed that Oswald’s knowledge of Russia extended beyondjust its language. Recall that native Russians thought he spoke the languagebetter than they did. She said her husband, George, and Oswald would havelengthy discussions about Russian literature, including such authors as Tolstoyand Dostoevsky—an incredible feat for a high-school dropout whose Russian wasself-taught.She said Oswald even subscribed to a Soviet satirical journal titled TheCrocodile and had a large collection of photographs he claimed to have taken inseveral different areas of Russia. Officially, Oswald never ventured outsideMoscow and Minsk.Gary Mack has reported that three language experts at Southern MethodistUniversity in Dallas studied tape recordings made of Oswald. They were not toldthe identity of the man whose voice they heard. All agreed that the Englishwords spoken seemed acquired later in life—that English was not the nativetongue of the man on the tape.This startling conclusion was supported by Mrs. DeMohrenschildt, who told thisauthor she was more amazed by Oswald’s English than his Russian. She said hespoke in deliberate and precise terms, rarely ever using slang or curse words.She said, “Everybody always talks about how good his Russian was. I was alwayssurprised at the English coming from this boy who was brought up in the South. Iwondered, ‘Where did he learn such proper English—certainly not from hismother.’”A particularly intriguing hint at impersonation came in the fall of 1963, when aletter was sent to the Russian embassy in Washington. It was signed by LeeHarvey Oswald, who was writing about his alleged travel to Mexico City. Thesecond sentence of the letter—the Warren Commission published both hishandwritten draft and the typed letter—reads, “I was unable to remain in Mexicoindefinitely [sic] because of my mexican [sic] visa restrictions which was [sic]for 15 days only. I could not take a chance on requesting a new visa unless Iused my real name [emphasis added], so I returned to the United States.”Since his passport and visa forms—as well as the November 9, 1963, embassyletter—were in the name of Lee Harvey Oswald, researchers are left to wonderabout the meaning of having to use “my real name.”In 2003, researcher John Armstrong published a lengthy and heavily documentedbook advancing the theory that a second Oswald, rather than a Soviet agent, hadbeen groomed at a young age by US intelligence with an eye toward sending himinto Russia as a spy. Armstrong titled his book Harvey & Lee: How the CIA FramedOswald. Meticulously footnoted and running to more than 1,000 pages, his booktoday is both costly and hard to obtain. His evidence, however, is compelling.Under Armstrong’s theory, in the late 1950s a young man in New York City from afamily with an Eastern European background who could speak Russian fluently wasto be sent as a spy to Russia. But he would not go under his real name, so hisbackground was merged with that of a patriotic American youth named Lee HarveyOswald. A switch was made when both Lee and the New Yorker Armstrong identifiesas Harvey were in military service. This identity switch very probably wasaccomplished with the knowledge and assistance of Lee Oswald.Harvey went to Russia and eventually became the Oswald arrested in Dallas. Hewas the only Oswald known to his wife, Marina, and to his New Orleans coworkerJudyth Vary Baker.The real Lee Oswald was seen working with anti-Castro Cubans at a time whenHarvey was in Russia and most probably was eliminated by the time of theassassination or shortly thereafter. Fantastic as this may sound, it fits allthe known evidence and goes far in explaining the scramble by US intelligenceagencies to cover up the truth of the legend that is Lee Harvey Oswald.Some examples of Armstrong’s findings include: • Statements by New Orleans resident Ed Voebel, who claimed to havebefriended Oswald while both were attending Beauregard Junior High School inthat city, at a time in 1954 when both his mother and brother said Oswald wasattending Stripling Junior High in Fort Worth. • Frank Kudlaty, former assistant principal of Stripling, recalledthat the day after the assassination, he was ordered to retrieve Oswald’srecords from the school and hand them over to FBI agents. Neither Oswald’srecords nor any mention of Kudlaty has been found in the National Archives. • FBI records show information was developed that an Oswald livedwith his father and two uncles, who were Hungarian communists, at 77th and 2ndAvenue in New York City. Oswald, whose father died before he was born, grew upin Fort Worth. • In Warren Commission Exhibit 1384 are New York school recordsshowing Oswald attended 171 days at Public School No. 44. Yet, New York Cityattendance officer James Brennan reported Oswald was excessively absent from PSNo. 44, more than forty-six days. Armstrong concluded, “These contradictoryrecords appear to reflect the activities of two different people—both named ‘LeeHarvey Oswald.’ The short, malnourished Oswald truanted [often] and was remandedto the Youth House, while the tall, well-built Oswald attended PS No. 44regularly.” • In December 1963 as requested, Administrative Judge FlorenceKelley of the Family Court of the State of New York personally handed overOswald’s New York school (Case File 23979) and psychiatric records to FBIspecial agent in charge John Malone with the condition he give the filesdirectly to the Warren Commission. Later, the original documents turned upmissing and only photographic copies were available prompting Armstrong toconclude, “Whenever original records are destroyed and only copies orphotographs remain, it is probable that the original documents were altered andthen photographed.” • Palmer E. McBride told the FBI he had worked with Oswald in1957–1958 at the Pfisterer Dental Lab in New Orleans. Military records showedOswald was serving in the Marines in Japan at this time. • Although records show five-year-old Oswald had his tonsils removedin 1945, military records noted he was treated for tonsillitis while in theMarines. • The husky, older Oswald photographed and tape recorded in MexicoCity in 1963 obviously was not the Oswald arrested in Dallas. • Deputy sheriff Roger Craig claimed he witnessed Oswald gettinginto a station wagon moments after the assassination. His account was supportedby passing motorists Roy Cooper and Marvin Robinson. Yet, officially, Oswald wasboarding a city bus driven by Cecil McWatters.Based on indisputable evidence of impersonation if not a physical switch, authorEddowes went into a Texas court on January 10, 1979, and asked that Oswald’sgrave be opened. He had the support of the Dallas County Medical Examiner’sOffice, which was convinced there was enough question about the identity of thebody to warrant an exhumation.The Oswald Exhumation [Contents.html#rsec97]Soon after Eddowes asked to have Oswald’s body exhumed, political fights sprangup between conflicting jurisdictions. Oswald had been killed in Dallas County,but his body was buried in Rose Hill Cemetery, which is in nearby TarrantCounty. While the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office had authorized anexhumation, Tarrant County officials balked.On June 1, 1979, Texas district judge James Wright denied Eddowes’s exhumationrequest. Dallas County assistant medical examiner Dr. Linda Norton told newsreporters, “I feel it would be in the public interest to conduct the exhumation.However, there are apparent legal disagreements . . . and political forces whodo not want this body dug up.”Norton said her efforts to exhume the body were being thwarted by Tarrant Countydistrict attorney Tim Curry, an elected official. The case dragged on.Eddowes was not the first to seek an exhumation of Oswald’s body. A WarrenCommission document declassified only in 1975 revealed that CIA officials weresuspicious of Oswald’s true identity as early as 1964. In a Commissionmemorandum dated March 13, 1964, staff member W. David Slawson wrote about aletter from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover on February 26, 1964. In this memo,Slawson quoted Hoover as writing, “The CIA is interested in the scar on Oswald’sleft wrist. . . . The FBI is reluctant to exhume Oswald’s body as requested bythe CIA.” In this same memo, Slawson expressed his own questions about what mayhave happened to Oswald in Russia:This whole aspect of Oswald’s life and especially our attempt to authenticate itare highly secret at this point. . . . [Slawson mentions the reported suicideattempt by Oswald cutting his wrist shortly after arriving in Russia.]Therefore, if the suicide incident is a fabrication, the time spent by Oswaldrecovering from the suicide [attempt] in a Moscow hospital could have been spentby him in Russian secret police custody, being coached, brainwashed, etc.Funeral director Paul Groody, who buried Oswald in 1963, told this author thatSecret Service agents came to him three weeks after Oswald’s burial askingquestions about marks on the body. Groody said, “They told me, ‘We don’t knowwho we have in that grave.’”Furthermore, Oswald’s own mother asked for an exhumation in 1967, expressingquestions as to the identity of the body in her son’s grave. Marguerite Oswaldtold local news reporters that she did not believe her son had scars on his bodyas described by the Warren Commission.Mrs. Oswald previously had told the Warren Commission how her son had seemedchanged after arriving back in Fort Worth from Russia. She said she noticed hewas losing his hair and that Oswald told her he was going bald “because of thecold weather in Texas.” She also noted, “And Lee was very, very thin when I sawhim.”Oswald’s brother Robert also noted changes in Oswald when he arrived back in theUnited States. He told the Warren Commission:His appearance had changed to the extent that he had lost a considerable amountof hair; his hair had become very kinky in comparison with his naturally curlyhair prior to his departure to Russia. . . . He appeared the first couple ofdays upon his return . . . to be rather tense and anxious. I also noted that hiscomplexion had changed somewhat to the extent that he had always been very faircomplected—his complexion was rather ruddy at this time—you might say itappeared like an artificial suntan that you get out of a bottle, but veryslight—in other words, a tint of brown to a tint of yellow. . . . He appeared tohave picked up something of an accent.Oswald’s half-brother, John Edward Pic, was even more pointed in his comments tothe Warren Commission concerning Lee’s appearance after returning from Russia:I would have never recognized him, sir. . . . He was much thinner than Iremembered him. He didn’t have as much hair. . . . His face features weresomewhat different, being his eyes were set back maybe, you know like in theseArmy pictures, they looked different than I remembered him. His face was rounder. . . when he went in the Marine Corps [Oswald had] a bull neck. This I didn’tnotice at all. I looked for this, I didn’t notice it at all, sir.Pic went on to tell how he became angered when Oswald introduced him to avisitor as his half-brother. He said Oswald had never previously mentioned thatPic was only a half-brother.Shown a photo reportedly taken of young Oswald in 1953 at the Bronx Zoo, Pictold Warren Commission attorney Albert Jenner, “Sir, from that picture, I couldnot recognize that that is Lee Harvey Oswald.” Jenner queried, “He doesn’t looklike you recall Lee looked in 1952 and 1953 when you saw him in New York City?”Pic replied, “No, sir.”In August 1979, Dallas County medical examiner Dr. Charles Petty formally calledfor an exhumation and asked his counterpart in Tarrant County to order it.However, this request, along with Eddowes’s offer to pay the premium on a$100,000 indemnification bond to allow the exhumation to proceed, was rejectedby District Attorney Curry.Then in February 1980, Dr. Petty reversed himself and said he would not order anexhumation. Meanwhile, the court found that Eddowes, being a British citizen,lacked any legal standing in a Texas court.By the summer of 1980, Eddowes was joined in his exhumation efforts by MarinaOswald, who provided the necessary legal standing.As the foot-dragging of Tarrant County officials to an Oswald exhumation beganto ease, another roadblock was thrown in the way of an exhumation—this time byOswald’s brother Robert. On August 15, 1980, Robert Oswald won an injunctionagainst the exhumation, saying it would cause his family anguish. This wasconsidered very odd by assassination researchers because if the exhumationshowed the man in the grave was not Oswald, it would have exonerated his brotheras a presidential assassin. If the exhumation proved the body was Oswald,nothing would have changed. So what harm could be done?The case dragged on for more months. Finally, on August 20, 1981, Marina filedsuit to have the grave opened. And on October 4, 1981—nine months afterMarguerite Oswald died from cancer in a Fort Worth hospital and was quietlyburied alongside her son Lee—the exhumation of the Oswald grave took place.Opposition to the exhumation had suddenly vanished. Robert Oswald said he couldnot afford to fight the issue further in court.The body was taken from Rose Hill Cemetery in the early morning hours and drivento Baylor Medical Center in Dallas for study. A team of four forensicpathologists compared the teeth of the corpse brought from the Oswald grave withOswald’s Marine Corps dental records.Almost four hours after the study began, the results were in. Dr. Norton, whoheaded the exhumation study, stated, “Beyond any doubt, and I mean any doubt,the individual buried under the name Lee Harvey Oswald in Rose Hill Cemetery isin fact Lee Harvey Oswald.”Within hours, local newspapers carried the headlines:  —DOCTORS IDENTIFY BODY AS OSWALD,  —AUTOPSY PROVES BODY IS OSWALD’S and  —OSWALD ISSUE FINALLY AT RESTWhile some discrepancies were found between the corpse’s teeth and Oswald’smilitary dental records, the doctors were satisfied that enough similaritiesremained to warrant their conclusion. Also, a hole was discovered behind theleft ear, which corresponded to Oswald’s known mastoid operation.The issue appeared to be settled. But, as with so much else in the Kennedyassassination, this was not to be.A few weeks after the Oswald exhumation, the two funeral home directors whoprepared Oswald’s body for burial in 1963 got together and talked. Paul Groodyand Alan Baumgartner were troubled. They were not supposed to have been at thepost-exhumation examination. But at the last minute, Marina Oswald had askedthem to be present and identify rings on the corpse.Entering the autopsy room in Dallas, both men confirmed that the rings were onthe corpse in the same location they had placed them in 1963. However, as theforensic examination continued, both Groody and Baumgartner noticed that theskull of the corpse under examination was in one piece—completely intact.Weeks later, after discussing the matter between themselves, the funeral homedirectors discussed the situation with Texas assassination researchers and gavestartling information—the body that was exhumed in 1981 was not the same bodythey buried in 1963.What confirmed this idea in their minds was the absence of signs of acraniotomy, a normal autopsy procedure. A craniotomy involves drawing the skinoff the human skull and cutting off the top of the skull with a bone saw,usually in a V-shaped cut. This allows forensic pathologists to view the brain.There can be no question that this procedure was performed on Oswald’s bodysince the weight of his brain was recorded in the autopsy report. Furthermore,both funeral home directors recalled the craniotomy in preparing the body forburial. Groody said, “I put the skull back together and sewed up his scalp.”Yet both men have said they noticed no sign of the craniotomy on the skull theyviewed during the 1981 exhumation study. If there was no craniotomy performed onthe skull in Oswald’s grave, it is proof that the body is not the same oneburied there in 1963.There are other indications that some manipulation may have taken place with thebody. To begin with, Marina Oswald told news reporters that she received atelephone call around Easter 1964 from government officials asking her to signpapers authorizing the installation of an electronic alarm system at the Oswaldgrave. She said a “respectful” man in a gray suit came to her home shortly afterthe call and had her sign some papers. She told United Press International, “Isigned lots of papers and they were never translated or explained to me. Ididn’t even speak English. I just did what I was told.”Prior to the exhumation, Marina was nearly convinced that Oswald’s body had beenremoved from the grave, most probably after the signing of the papers in 1964.As far as is known, no electronic alarm system was ever installed at the Oswaldgrave.Prior to the exhumation, mortician Groody told reporters how carefully Oswaldhad been embalmed. He also described how the body was placed in an airtightcoffin that was placed inside an airtight cement vault. Groody said that uponexhumation Oswald’s body should look exactly as it had the day he was buried.However, when workers exhumed the grave, they found the cement vault in piecesand the seal on the coffin broken. Water and air had gotten into the coffin andOswald’s body had deteriorated to skeletal remains.While the rupture of seals on both the vault and the coffin is not an impossibleoccurrence, several morticians interviewed by this author said such an event ishighly unusual. It could be explained by movement of the earth, althoughnorth-central Texas is regarded as a very stable area. The broken seals alsocould be explained by someone having opened the grave prior to the 1981exhumation.A logical time for such a pre-exhumation grave opening would have been earlierin 1981, when Marguerite Oswald was buried next to Oswald’s grave. The presenceof earthmoving equipment and a canopy covering both graves provided anopportunity for covertly opening Oswald’s adjacent grave.So, the question has been asked: Was a substitution made for the body inOswald’s grave?The answer may be found in a four-hour videotape made of the 1981 exhumationstudy. The tape was commissioned by Marina Oswald and Eddowes and was producedby Hampton Hall, the son of a Texas politician.Once the craniotomy question became known to Marina, a friend and neighbor wasasked to view the tape. The neighbor, along with his personal physician, viewedthe videotape and reported that there was no sign or mention of a craniotomy.This added further suspicions about the exhumation.Finally, in 1984—four years after the exhumation—a detailed report on theexhumation findings was published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Thereport claimed, “A previous autopsy saw cut in the usual fashion was present onthe calvarium with an anterior inverted V-notch in the right frontal region. Thecalvarium was maintained in continuity with the remainder of the skull by virtueof decomposed mummified tissue. The previously sawed calvarium was not separatednor was it easily dislodged.”In other words, decomposed, jelly-like skin had coated the Oswald skull, whichmade it appear to be in one piece.Researchers were skeptical of this information and turned to Marina forconfirmation of the craniotomy by viewing the videotape of the exhumation. Oddlyenough, photographer Hall refused to give up the tape, claiming that so muchtime had elapsed that ownership of the tape had reverted to him.In February 1984, Marina was forced to go to court to retrieve the videotape shehad commissioned. By the summer of 1986, an out-of-court settlement resulted ina promise to return the tape. Apparently, the tape still has not been returned.The issue should have been a simple one: view the tapes and photos of theexhumation and resolve whether the craniotomy marks were visible on the Oswaldskull. But with the tapes still not available even by 2013, this issue remainsin controversy, like so much else in the JFK assassination case.Researchers remain intrigued. If the body exhumed in 1981 was indeed that ofOswald—as confirmed by the forensic pathologists and his Marine dentalX-rays—but the exhumed corpse was not that of the man buried in 1963—as claimedby the two morticians—then it is possible that an impostor Oswald was killed inDallas and his body—or at least the head—exchanged for Oswald’s sometime priorto the exhumation.And who might have the power and authority to accomplish such a momentous task?The idea that the Soviets, Castro agents, or mobsters could switch bodies isludicrous. Only the federal government of the United States, with its access tothe military and such devices as the Federal Witness Protection Program, couldaccomplish something of that magnitude.The impersonation of Oswald would appear to be an issue that could be resolvedeasily by a truthful government investigation. Instead, it is another area ofthe assassination full of omissions, inconsistencies, and possible deceit.In the end, the issue of Oswald’s impersonation may be a moot point, sincepersuasive evidence suggests that the Oswald in Dallas—whether lone nut,American agent, communist operative, genuine, or substitute—did not killPresident Kennedy."},{"pageContent":"Convenient Deaths [Contents.html#rch21]In the three-year period that followed the murders of President Kennedy and LeeHarvey Oswald, eighteen material witnesses died—six by gunfire, three in motoraccidents, two by suicide, one from a cut throat, one from a karate chop to theneck, and five from natural causes.An actuary, engaged by the London Sunday Times, concluded that on November 22,1963, the odds against these witnesses being dead by February 1967 were onehundred thousand trillion to one.The above comment on the deaths of assassination witnesses was published in atabloid companion piece to the movie Executive Action, released in 1973. By thattime, part of the mythology of the Kennedy assassination included thequestionable deaths of people who were connected with it.By the mid-1960s, people in Dallas already were whispering about the number ofpeople who died under strange or questionable circumstances. Well into the1980s, witnesses and others were hesitant to come forward with informationbecause of the stories of strange and sudden death that seemed to visit somepeople with information about the assassination.Finally, in the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations feltcompelled to look into the matter. But aside from attempting to discredit theLondon Sunday Times actuarial study, the committee was unable to come to anyconclusions regarding the growing number of deaths. The committee said it couldnot make a valid actuarial study due to the broad number and types of peoplethat had to be included in such a study.In response to a letter from the committee, London Sunday Times legal managerAnthony Whitaker backpedaled on the publication’s original statements bywriting, “Our piece about the odds against the deaths of the Kennedy witnesseswas, I regret to say, based on a careless journalistic mistake and should nothave been published. This was realized by the Sunday Times editorial staff afterthe first edition—the one which goes to the United States . . . —had gone out,and later editions were amended.”Whitaker said there was no question of the actuary having gotten his answerwrong: it was simply that they asked him the wrong question. “He was asked whatwere the odds against 15 named people out of the population of the United Statesdying within a short period of time to which he replied—correctly—that they werevery high. However, if one asks what are the odds against 15 of those includedin the Warren Commission Index dying within a given period, the answer is, ofcourse, that they are much lower. Our mistake was to treat the reply to theformer question as if it dealt with the latter,” he explained.This settled the matter for the House committee, which apparently made little orno attempt to seriously study the number of deaths that followed the JFKassassination. Jacqueline Hess, the committee’s chief of research for the JFKinvestigation, reported, “Our final conclusion on the issue is that theavailable evidence does not establish anything about the nature of these deathswhich would indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct orperipheral, caused by the assassination of President Kennedy or by any aspect ofthe subsequent investigation.”But the controversy continued well into 2013. Blogger Richard Charnin, who holdsa master’s degree in applied mathematics and is a former numerical controlengineer for Grumman Aerospace Corporation, has provided a detailed analysis ofthis issue. Charnin argued that the US population is not relevant—the number ofJFK-related witnesses is. Charnin also pointed out that Whitaker neglected toprovide unnatural-death mortality statistics.Utilizing a comprehensive spreadsheet database of suspicious unnatural witnessdeaths, probability calculations, and Warren Commission, Garrison/Shaw trial,and HSCA witnesses, Charnin stated:The identity of the actuary has never been revealed. The Sunday Times editor didnot provide details on the methodology. In fact, he claimed that the problem wasmisstated, implying that the actuary’s probability calculation was wrong. [My]analysis will show that the actuary’s calculation was essentially correct. Itwill show that the editor’s 1977 response to the House Select Committee onAssassinations was misleading and incomplete. And that HSCA statistical expertJacqueline Hess’s claim that the actuary’s calculation was “invalid” due to the“impossibility” of defining the “universe” of material witnesses wasdisinformation. The number of JFK-related witnesses is a finite 1,400 plus [asprovided by Michael Benson’s 1993 book Who’s Who in the JFK Assassination]. Thedismissal of the actuary’s odds was just a continuation of the cover-up.Former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi also argued against thesignificance of the JFK witness deaths, citing Robert M. Musen, vice presidentand senior actuary at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Musen had calculatedthe odds of 15 people out of 2,479 in the Warren Commission Index dying within athree-year period, assuming a median age of 40, to be 98.16 percent.Bugliosi failed to note that fewer than five hundred witnesses actuallytestified to the Commission and that several names included in the index, suchas George Washington and other presidents, were not witnesses and, in fact, hadno connection to the assassination. Furthermore, Musen failed to considerunnatural deaths. “Even assuming 2,479 names,” explained Charnin, “approximatelyfour unnatural and 70 natural deaths from the list would be expected over athree year period. . . . The odds that at least 15 of 2,479 would dieunnaturally within 3 years is one in 46,000. The odds of 18 dying unnaturally is1 in 3.6 million.”Charnin said his analysis countered the “feeble attempts to rebut and obfuscatethe actuary’s 100,000 trillion to 1 odds” by showing at least 33 of 1,400 JFKassassination-related witnesses died unnaturally in the three years followingthe assassination. “The probability of this occurrence is 1 in 137 TRILLIONTRILLION! Only two or three would normally be expected,” he said.An objective look at both the number and the causes of death balanced againstthe importance of the person’s connection to the case plus the timing withconcurrent investigations still causes raised eyebrows among researchers.This section has been titled “Convenient Deaths” because these deaths certainlywould have been convenient for anyone not wishing the truth of the JFKassassination to become public.Government apologists, in particular the CIA, have gone to some lengths todiscredit the idea of mysterious deaths plaguing assassination witnesses. A 1967memo from CIA headquarters to station chiefs advised, “The [Warren] Commissionstaff questioned 418 witnesses—the FBI interviewed far more people, conducting25,000 interviews and reinterviews—and in such a large group, a certain numberof deaths are to be expected.”However, the means of eliminating unwanted witnesses certainly existed, boththen and now. Testifying before the Church Committee about CIA improprieties in1975, CIA technicians revealed a variety of TWEP technology—“Termination WithExtreme Prejudice”—that cannot be detected in a postmortem examination.One letter from an agency consultant to a CIA officer listed circumstances underwhich people could be killed but made to look like natural death, accident, orsuicide. The letter went on to show that undetected murders do not necessarilyhave to be the result of sophisticated technology. It stated, “There are twotechniques which I believe should be mentioned since they require no specialequipment besides a strong arm and the will to do such a job. These would beeither to smother the victim with a pillow or to strangle him with a wide pieceof cloth such as a bath towel. In such cases, there are no specific anatomicchanges to indicate the cause of death.”While it is obvious that the CIA—and hence the mob through operatives who workfor both—has the capability of killing, it is less well known that the agencyhas developed drugs to induce cancer. Jack Ruby claimed to have been given sucha drug just as he was granted a new trial.As far back as 1952, a CIA memo reported on the cancer-causing effects ofberyllium: “This is certainly the most toxic inorganic element and it produces apeculiar fibrotic tumor at the site of local application. The amount necessaryto produce these tumors is a few micrograms.”Local law-enforcement officers and coroners are not equipped, either by trainingor by inclination, to detect deaths induced by such sophisticated means. Theylook for signs of a struggle, evidence of a break-in, bruises, or marks on thevictim. With no evidence to the contrary, many deaths are ruled suicide oraccident. Others are ruled due to natural causes, such as heart attack.The possibility of convenient deaths leads one into a well of paranoia, yet thislong list cannot be summarily dismissed.Consider the question: When does coincidence end and conspiracy begin?It is especially interesting to note how the deaths are grouped.Early Deaths [Contents.html#rsec98]Early deaths included Mary Richardson, wife of the New Orleans minister to whomJudyth Vary Baker revealed knowledge of the New Orleans cancer lab; JackZangretti, who expressed foreknowledge of Oswald’s shooting; and Gary Underhill,a CIA officer who claimed the agency was involved.Early in 1964, as the Warren Commission investigation was getting under way,there was a rash of deaths of people who may have known of an Oswald-Rubyconnection. These included former Ruby employees Betty McDonald and TeresaNorton; Hank Killam, husband of a Ruby employee, and Teresa Norton; Dallasreporters Bill Hunter and Jim Koethe, both of whom had been in Ruby’s apartmentthe weekend of the assassination. Dead in New Orleans were former FBI agent GuyBanister and his private investigator Hugh Ward, who was killed in a plane crashalong with New Orleans mayor DeLesseps Morrison. Eddie Benavides, brother to J.D. Tippit shooting witness Domingo Benavides, was shot in the head, apparentlymistaken for his brother.About the time the Warren Commission Report was released in the fall of 1964,Mary Pinchot Meyer, a JFK confidante and former wife to CIA chief Cord Meyer,was murdered and C. D. Jackson, the Life magazine senior vice president wholocked away the Zapruder film, died. Shortly after Jackson’s death, Life writerPaul Mandel, who tried to explain Kennedy’s throat wound by saying he turnedrearward to wave, also died.Deaths in 1965 included Ruby’s first lawyer, Tom Howard; Guy Banister’s pilotMaurice Gatlin; and Rose Cheramie, who reported the assassination in advance.Also dead were Mona B. Saenz, a Texas employment clerk who had interviewedOswald; David Goldstein, who had helped the FBI trace Oswald’s pistol; andcolumnist Dorothy Kilgallen and her close friend Mrs. Earl Smith, who may havekept Kilgallen’s JFK notes, which subsequently disappeared. In December 1965William Whaley, the cabdriver who reportedly drove Oswald to Oak Cliff, becamethe only Dallas cabdriver killed on duty.The deaths of those potential witnesses continued in 1966, including Ruby trialjudge Joe Brown, Oswald’s landlady Earlene Roberts, and Ruby dancers MarilynDelilah Walle and Karen “Little Lynn” Carlin. Also dead were Albert Bogard, whotold of Oswald test driving a new car prior to the assassination; captain FrankMartin, the Dallas police official who said there was a lot more to be said inthe assassination; and Lee Bowers Jr., who told of seeing men behind the woodenpicket fence at the time of the shooting.Deaths in late 1966 included the reported suicide of William Pitzer, whophotographed the JFK autopsy; Jimmy Levens, a Fort Worth nightclub owner whohired Ruby employees; James Worrell Jr., who saw someone flee the rear of theTexas School Book Depository; Clarence Oliver, a district attorney investigatorwho worked the Ruby case; and Hank Suydam, the Life magazine official in chargeof JFK stories.In 1967, as New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison began his JFKinvestigation, Jack Ruby died, along with Navy photographer Leonard Pullin andHarold Russell, who witnessed the escape of Officer Tippit’s killer. There werealso the deaths of key Garrison witnesses David Ferrie, who died from a blow tothe neck ruled accidental; former Ferrie roommate Eladio Del Valle; and cancerresearcher Dr. Mary Sherman.New Orleans–connected deaths continued into 1968 with that of New Orleanscoroner Dr. Nicholas Chetta, who had ruled on Ferrie’s death, and Philip Geraci,who spoke of an Oswald–Clay Shaw connection.In early 1969, deaths included Henry Delaune, the brother-in-law to coronerChetta; E. R. “Buddy” Walthers, the deputy sheriff who saw the bullet in thegrass in Dealey Plaza; and the Reverend Clyde Johnson, who was scheduled totestify in the Shaw trial. Also dead were Charles Mentensana, who had filmed arifle being brought out of the Depository; John Crawford, a close friend to bothJack Ruby and witness Wesley Frazier; and Mary Bledsoe, an Oswald neighbor whoalso knew David Ferrie.In 1970, Dallas underworld figure George McGann, who was married to the“babushka lady” Beverly Oliver, was murdered. That year also witnessed thedeaths of Abraham Zapruder and Dallas County sheriff Bill Decker. In 1971, afiery explosion at work killed Roscoe White, identified by his son as the GrassyKnoll gunman. Also dying by mid-1971 was Darrell Garner, arrested for shootingTippit witness Warren Reynolds; Clayton Fowler, Ruby’s chief defense attorney;CIA deputy director General Charles Cabell; and mobsters James Plumeri andSalvatore Granello, tied to CIA assassination plots.Strange Deaths Continue [Contents.html#rsec99]Between 1972 and the end of 1976, during the time of the Church Committeeinvestigations into CIA improprieties, there again was a spurt of deaths amongJFK assassination figures. These included House Majority Leader and WarrenCommissioner Hale Boggs; FBI director J. Edger Hoover, along with his assistantClyde Tolson; Chief Justice Earl Warren; Garrison suspect Clay Shaw; Dallasmayor Earle Cabell; CIA officer William Harvey; and General Earl Wheeler, aliaison between JFK and the CIA. Murder victims included Dave Yaras, a closefriend to both Jimmy Hoffa and Jack Ruby, and mafia bosses Sam Giancana and JohnRoselli, both scheduled to testify to the Church Committee. Also dying duringthis time were Ruby-connected gunrunner Thomas E. Davis; Ruby business partnerRalph Paul; Connally’s physician Dr. Charles Gregory; Dallas motorcycle officerJames Chaney; and J. A. Milteer, the Miami right-winger who predicted JFK’sdeath and the capture of a scapegoat.The year 1977 produced a bumper crop of candidates for listing under convenientdeaths connected to the JFK assassination—including the deaths of six top FBIofficials, all of whom were scheduled to testify before the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations.Topping this list was former number-three man in the FBI William C. Sullivan,who had already had a preliminary meeting with investigators for the Housecommittee. Sullivan was shot with a high-powered rifle near his New Hampshirehome by a man who claimed to have mistaken him for a deer. The man was chargedwith a misdemeanor—”shooting a human being by accident”—and released into thecustody of his father, a state policeman. There was no further investigation ofSullivan’s death.Louis Nicholas was a special assistant to J. Edgar Hoover as well as Hoover’sliaison with the Warren Commission. Alan H. Belmont also was a special assistantto Hoover. James Cadigan was a document expert with access to many classifiedassassination documents, while J. M. English headed the FBI laboratory whereOswald’s rifle and pistol were tested. Donald Kaylor was the FBI fingerprintexpert who examined prints found at the assassination scene. None of these sixbureau officials lived to tell what they knew to the House committee.During the House committee investigation into the JFK assassination, the newsmedia reported the deaths of other key assassination witnesses, such as GeorgeDeMohrenschildt and former Cuban president Carlos Prio Socarras, who died withinweeks of each other in 1977, just as they, too, were being sought by the Housecommittee.The ranks of both organized crime and US intelligence agencies were thinned bydeaths beginning in 1975, the time of the Senate Intelligence Hearings, and1978, the closing months of the House committee.Charles Nicoletti, a mobster connected with the CIA-Mafia assassination plots,was murdered in Chicago, while William Pawley, a former diplomat connected withboth organized-crime and CIA figures, reportedly committed suicide. Other deathsduring this time included Lou Staples, a Dallas radio talk show host who toldfriends he would break the assassination case; Air Force One chief stewardJoseph C. Ayres; and U-2 pilot Francis G. Powers.Adding to rumors that “hit teams” may have been at work, a Time magazine articlereported that federal agents had initiated a nationwide investigation into morethan twenty gangland assassinations constituting what agents believed was an“open underworld challenge to governmental infiltration of Mafia activities.”A New York News story concerning this official fear of roving assassinationsquads specifically mentioned the death of Sam Giancana, killed one day beforehe was to testify about mob-CIA connections and despite being under governmentprotection.The shooting death of Mary Pinchot Meyer may provide insights into themachinations of top government officials. She was the former wife of Cord Meyer,since 1962 the head of the CIA’s Directorate of Plans Covert Action Staff. Thescion of a wealthy, socially prominent, and politically connected family, a WWIIcombat hero and honors graduate of Yale, Cord Meyer was probably the closestrival to JFK in position, intelligence, and opportunity. This story of wealthand prominence mixed with intrigue and murder was made public in the brilliant2012 book Mary’s Mosaic by Peter Janney, who was friends with Mary’s childrenand was the son of CIA official Wistar Janney.In early 1945, while attending Yale Law School, Meyer met and wed a beautifulsocialite named Mary Pinchot. Their marriage became a partnership of idealisticequals as they crusaded for world peace. Cord Meyer caught the attention ofUnited Nations higher-ups by writing a paper advocating a federation of nationsand on May 2, he became an aide to Harold Stassen, who helped establish theUnited Nations.With his new bride, Meyer accompanied Stassen to a conference on the UnitedNations later that month. Mary was reporting for United Press International.There she became reacquainted with John F. Kennedy, who was reporting on theconference for the Chicago Herald-American. But when Kennedy attempted tointerview Cord, he was snubbed. Reportedly this was a rebuke he never forgot,later ignoring Cord’s request for an ambassadorship.Later that same month, Cord Meyer’s outlook on life changed when his fraternaltwin brother, Quintin, was killed in action on Okinawa. He slowly became moreand more distant from Mary. His focus turned inward and he became a chain-smokerand alcoholic. In 1951, he left the United World Federalists, which he hadhelped fund, and joined the CIA at the invitation of Allen Dulles.According to author Janney:Somewhere in the bowels of the Washington E Street offices of the newly formedCIA, Cord Meyer transformed all his poetic, insightful visionary and wisdom intoperfecting schemes and strategies for America’s greater power and control, theoften subtle but effective attempts at world domination—no matter what the cost.[He was a] Cold Warrior by day, increasingly frustrated and intoxicated atnight.The Meyer marriage broke up in 1956 and, following the death of her son Michael,who was hit by a car, Mary moved to Massachusetts, where she socialized in thesame circles as JFK. Kennedy reportedly was unhappy with Jackie and wanted outof this marriage but knew it would be political suicide. He began to visit Maryat her rented home, which was within an hour of the Kennedy compound. Theirrelationship grew and matured. Janney wrote, “She was one of the few women hereally respected, maybe the only one.”This liaison continued through 1963, with Mary introducing Jack to a broaderview of the world, the benefits of peace, and even drugs such as LSD andmarijuana. Communicating with Harvard psychologist and drug culture guru TimothyLeary, Mary devised a plan to give careful amounts of LSD to ranking governmentofficials so as to reprogram them to build a more peaceful society.Theologian James W. Douglass wrote, “Although Kennedy was a Cold Warrior who hadtaken the world to the very brink of nuclear war, there was a more peacefulelement in his character from which God could create something new. What was theseed of his transformation? . . . What was the seed of his change from thepresident of a national security state into a leader with a more universalhumanity, which . . . would then mark him out for assassination?” Janney came tobelieve the seed was his relationship with Mary Meyer, an intellectual,self-assured woman who bridled at playing the meek Washington socialite.Following the JFK assassination and despite warnings from her friends, Marycould not stop talking about it in the capital’s social circles, raisingquestions and pointing out inconsistencies in the official version.On October 12, 1964, she was shot in the head while walking on the C&OChesapeake Canal towpath near her home. When the shot failed to kill her, asecond shot angled just beneath her right shoulder blade severed her aorta,killing her instantly. The precision of the shots indicated the work of aprofessional assassin. However, police found an unfortunate black man, RaymondCrump Jr., drunk and sleeping in the area and charged him with the crime.Despite oddities in the evidence and testimony (one key witness was found tohave a fraudulent identity and disappeared), it seemed Crump’s guilt was aforegone conclusion.However, a determined young attorney named Dovey J. Roundtree fought a tenaciousdefense, fully detailed in Mary’s Mosaic. Roundtree was able to show there wasno hard evidence to link Crump to the murder and that he likely was set up totake the blame. Crump was found not guilty and released.Before the news of Mary’s murder even was made public, a small group of peoplegathered at her Georgetown home, apparently searching for her diary, in whichshe had made copious notes. Cord Meyer and another ranking CIA official werethere along with James J. Angleton, head of the CIA’s counterintelligencedivision, and his wife, Cicely, a close friend of Mary’s. Also present were TonyBradlee, Mary’s sister and the wife of Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. Therewere conflicting accounts as to whether the group had broken into her home.Later it was revealed that Angleton admitted he had found the diary and relatedpapers and burned them.All this interconnection between members of Washington’s elite must be notedwhen taking into account the deathbed confession of CIA operative and Watergateburglar E. Howard Hunt.Following Hunt’s death in 2007, his sons St. John Hunt and David Hunt said theirfather had told them who was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate JFK.Topping Hunt’s list was Lyndon B. Johnson, followed by CIA officers Cord Meyer,William Harvey, and David Atlee Phillips. He also named CIA operative DavidMorales and a “French gunman on the Grassy Knoll,” thought by his son St. Johnto be Lucien Sarti.Could these names have been found in Mary Meyer’s diary? Regardless, her murdermay well have played an intricate part in the higher levels of the conspiracy tokill Kennedy. After all, his relationship with Mary Meyer may have been thecatalyst for Kennedy to attempt to construct a more peaceful and just world.This could not have set well with the war machine that America had become. AsMary once described Kennedy to Timothy Leary, “They couldn’t control himanymore.”Near the end of his life, Cord Meyer himself may have indicated some intimateknowledge of the assassination. According to author C. David Heymann, once whenMeyer was asked who killed Mary, he bitterly replied, “The same sons of bitchesthat killed John F. Kennedy.”"},{"pageContent":"PART IV [Contents.html#rpa4][images/f0539-01.jpg]CONCLUSIONS [Contents.html#rpa4]Since November 22, 1963, a massive amount of information has become availableconcerning the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. Some of it was madepublic immediately, but most of this information leaked out only after manyyears had passed. Much has proven erroneous, incomplete, and misleading in lightof later developments.What does the information available today tell us about Kennedy’s assassination?What conclusions may be drawn from the existing record? Based on all currentlyavailable information, most researchers have concluded: 1. Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in intelligence activities. He was—orat least he believed he was—working on behalf of the United States. 2. It is entirely possible that Lee Harvey Oswald did not fire a gun onNovember 22, 1963, thus making him innocent in the deaths of both PresidentKennedy and police officer J. D. Tippit. 3. If Lee Harvey Oswald did participate in the assassination—and muchevidence indicates he did not—he certainly did not act alone. 4. An abundance of evidence indicates that Lee Harvey Oswald was framedfor the assassination of President Kennedy. The evidence for someone posing asOswald in the months leading up to the assassination is more than compelling. 5. This framing of Oswald coupled with evidence of attempts to cover upvital evidence in the case proves the existence of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. 6. Because this cover-up went far beyond simple face-saving and wasconducted at the federal level, it is apparent that persons within the USgovernment were both involved in and aware of such a conspiracy. If there hadbeen a legitimate reason for such activities, it would have been revealed longbefore now. 7. The two most powerful men in the federal government in 1963—next tothe president and his brother—were vice president Lyndon B. Johnson and hisclose friend FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Both men were facing the end of theircareers if Kennedy was reelected in 1964. Johnson may have even faced prisontime due to his involvement in the TFX, Bobby Baker, and Billie Sol Estesscandals. 8. Both Johnson and Hoover could have been convicted—if not fororchestrating the assassination itself—certainly for participating in thedemonstrable cover-up that took place in its aftermath. Under the law, both menwere accessories after the fact and subject to criminal penalties.Even if Oswald—real or impersonator—was recruited as a Soviet agent, he wasplaying double, acting under orders from persons he believed to be in USintelligence. Despite his pro-Castro posturing, his contacts with Guy Banisterand David Ferrie in New Orleans and George DeMohrenschildt in Dallas andassorted FBI agents proved that in the months just prior to the assassination,Oswald was in contact with persons connected to US intelligence.Once it is understood that Oswald was—or believed he was—working as anintelligence operative, assassination evidence takes on a new perspective.It is apparent to many researchers that while Oswald most probably did obtain arifle and a pistol and may have made some sort of trip to Mexico, he likely wasfollowing orders from persons he considered to be his intelligence superiors.Thus, many of Oswald’s activities in the weeks prior to the assassination werecarefully calculated to both incriminate him and link him with foreigngovernments.While it is probable that Oswald was in some way connected with persons involvedin a plot against Kennedy, he may have felt secure in the belief that he wasreporting on that plot to the US government—most likely through the FBI.While it cannot be stated with absolute assurance that Oswald never fired aweapon on November 22, 1963, there is an abundance of supporting evidence thathe did not. The Dallas police paraffin test showed no gunpowder on Oswald’shands or cheek, evidence that he had not fired a rifle, particularly theloose-bolted Italian Carcano. Oswald maintained he was in the Depositorylunchroom at the time of the shooting and accurately named two coworkers whoindeed ate in the lunchroom that day. Testimony of other employees indicatesthat Oswald was seen on lower floors both minutes before and after theassassination.All this, together with the fact that less than ninety seconds after the shotswere fired Depository superintendent Roy Truly and Dallas policeman Marion Bakerencountered a calm and collected Oswald standing in a downstairs lunchroom witha soft drink in his hand, tends to support Oswald’s alibi.Whoever fired from the Depository did not act alone. This fact was supported in1979 by the House Select Committee on Assassinations’ scientific study ofacoustical material indicating that at least one shot came from the GrassyKnoll. These acoustical studies are supported by many witnesses as well as thephotographic enlargement of Mary Moorman’s snapshot depicting the “badgeman”figure.Today it is obvious to many researchers that multiple gunmen were shooting atKennedy and that the three shots fired in Dealey Plaza were actually threevolleys fired simultaneously—probably coordinated by radio.The presence of Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza at a time when allofficial agents were accounted for elsewhere is a particularly pertinent pieceof evidence. Either these men were bogus agents carrying identification goodenough to fool Dallas policemen or they were real agents carrying out someundocumented and unexplained activity.The medical and ballistic evidence, most of which can be called into question,bears all the earmarks of tampering and indicates Kennedy was struck by at leastthree shots—one in the back below the shoulder blades, which did not penetratehis body, one in the throat, and one in the head (although there is someevidence to suggest that two shots may have struck his head almostsimultaneously).Most probably, at least two shots struck Governor Connally—one penetrating hischest and lung while a separate bullet shattered his right wrist and entered hisleft thigh.At least one shot definitely missed the limousine altogether, striking the curbnear the Triple Underpass, slightly wounding bystander James Tague. Furthermore,there is evidence of three additional shots—one bullet struck the grass on thesouth side of Elm Street, another hit in the street near the presidentiallimousine, and yet another struck the Stemmons Freeway sign.This count would mean at least six shots were fired in Dealey Plaza—perhaps asmany as nine. It is significant to note that acoustical experts testified beforethe House Select Committee on Assassinations that they had discovered as many asnine sound signals that they could not rule out as gunshots, but only four wereconfirmed since only two sites for comparison tests were used.It is apparent to most researchers that the assassination was the result of awell-executed military-style ambush utilizing multiple gunmen firing from hiddenpositions—perhaps using fragmenting or “sabot” bullets and even silencers.To attempt to pinpoint each gunman’s location and calculate the number andeffect of each shot is an exercise in futility since actions were takenimmediately to eliminate evidence and confuse investigators. Even the Zapruderfilm is now under question as evidence.Since there would have been efforts to eliminate any evidence of foreknowledgeof the assassination, it is not surprising that the proof of the framing ofOswald is meager and largely circumstantial. However, it should be noted thatcircumstances cannot be altered and thus may prove to be better evidence thanphysical evidence, which can be falsified or planted.What is obvious and demonstrable is the cover-up perpetrated after theassassination.Herein lies the real key to understanding the truth of Kennedy’s death.While anyone could have engineered the assassination—Castro agents, KGBassassins, mob hit men, anti-Castro Cuban exiles, dissident CIA or FBI agents,even the infamous “lone nut”—who had the power to subvert and misdirect anymeaningful investigation after the assassination had occurred? Only rankingofficials of the federal government of the United States.Consider that in the wake of the assassination there has been:—A continuing and consistent pattern of suppression of evidence, destruction ofevidence, and intimidation of witnesses on the part of federal authorities,especially the FBI and the Warren Commission.—A continued unwillingness by the Justice Department—of which the FBI is apart—to pursue and prosecute assassination leads, even after being urged to doso by Congress.—Revelations concerning the presence of Secret Service agents encountered inDealey Plaza at the time of the shooting, when no agents were present accordingto official records.—The questionable activities of the CIA in providing false evidence to theWarren Commission while suppressing other vital evidence, such as the existenceof assassination plots involving the agency and organized-crime members.—The disconcerting pattern of communications blackouts occurring at the time ofthe assassination that involved the Texas School Book Depository, the Dallaspolice radio channel dedicated to presidential security, the missing code bookin the airplane carrying Kennedy’s cabinet, and the virtual shutdown of theWashington, DC, telephone system at a time when most Americans were only justbecoming aware that something had happened in Dallas.—The fact that elements of the 49th Armored Division were in the air returningfrom exercises in Germany on the day of the assassination, available to quellany disturbance caused by the event.—The revelation that Kennedy’s autopsy was performed by inexperienced Navydoctors who were ordered by higher authorities present not to follow establishedautopsy procedures, such as examining the president’s clothing and probing hiswounds. It was this flawed autopsy that has been most responsible for thecontinuing controversy over the medical evidence.—An effort on the part of federal authorities to lock assassination evidenceaway from the public. President Johnson ordered evidence locked up until theyear 2039, while the House Select Committee on Assassinations sealed up itsevidence for fifty years. Even the Assassinations Records Review Board of the1990s, while regaining many records, was not able to secure all governmentdocuments.The loss of the Oswald note while in the hands of the FBI, the prematureelimination of military and Secret Service files, and the immediate cleansing ofthe presidential limousine plainly constitute destruction of evidence.Evidence altered while in the hands of federal authorities includes the autopsyX-rays and photographs, the General Edwin Walker home photograph, the locationof Kennedy’s back wound, the nature of Kennedy’s throat wound, the Dallas policeevidence sheet, the location of book boxes in the “sniper’s nest,” and thetestimony of FBI official James Cadigan along with that of several keywitnesses, such as Phil Willis, Jean Hill, Roger Craig, Julia Ann Mercer, andthe reenactment surveyors.Instances of suppressed evidence include Kennedy’s missing brain, missingbullets, the actual results of spectrographic and neutron activation tests,Oswald’s photographic and optical equipment (including the Minox camera),Oswald’s paraffin test, the third Oswald backyard photograph, the incidentsinvolving Silvia Odio and Yuri Nosenko, and a variety of crucial assassinationwitnesses, including Bill and Gayle Newman, Charles Brehm, James Simmons, J. C.Price, Beverly Oliver, Ed Hoffman, Dallas policeman James Chaney, and manyothers.The intimidation of witnesses runs the full gamut from simple pressure to alterportions of their testimony to strange and unnatural deaths.Witnesses Charles Givens, James Tague, Phil Willis, Kennedy aides KennethO’Donnell and David Powers, and former senator Ralph Yarborough were pressuredto alter their statements, while others—including Ed Hoffman, A. J. Millican,Sandy Speaker, Acquilla Clemons, and Richard Carr—were threatened into silence.All of these examples of official misconduct go far beyond any innocent attemptto avoid tarnishing an agency’s reputation. Many of these incidents were obviousattempts to misdirect an impartial investigation and to incriminate Oswald.Persons who conduct such activity in connection with a murder case are legallyconsidered accomplices and subject to the same punishments as the perpetrators.The government had a strong ally in perpetrating a cover-up in the Kennedyassassination—a national news media that seemed incapable of looking pastofficial pronouncements.Assassination Coverage [Contents.html#rsec100]From the moment the Kennedy assassination occurred, coverage of the tragedyinvolved government manipulation of a news media that appeared only too willingto be manipulated.The Establishment media allowed themselves to be set up by official leaks andpronouncements about the assassination to the point where later officialfindings had to be accepted and defended.In the days following the assassination, Dallas-area newspapers were filled withfactual, if contradictory, information—Dallas County district attorney HenryWade voiced suspicion of a plot, various people told of seeing Oswald and Rubytogether prior to Kennedy’s death, and information concerning more than threeshots fired from more than one location was published. Outside Texas, however,wire-service reporting was limited to the official version of a lone assassinfiring three shots.Information on Oswald’s procommunist background was leaked by the FBI andtransmitted nationwide. Immediately media speculation was turned from whetherOswald acted alone to speculation on his motives.Despite the occasional insertion of the word “alleged” before the word“assassin,” the entire thrust of news coverage was aimed at Oswald’s guilt. TheNew York Times proclaimed: EVIDENCE AGAINST OSWALD DESCRIBED AS CONCLUSIVE,while the New York Post simply headlined: ASSASSIN NAMED.Even the Dallas–Fort Worth papers were not immune to this rush to judgment. Theday after the assassination, the Dallas Morning News told readers: PRO-COMMUNISTCHARGED WITH ACT. And the nearby Fort Worth Star-Telegram carried a front-pageheadline erroneously stating: PARAFFIN TESTS OF OSWALD SHOW HE HAD FIRED GUN.After Oswald’s death, with no one except his mother to contradict them, themedia began going further in their presumption of his guilt. A New York Timesheadline stated: PRESIDENT’S ASSASSIN SHOT. A Time magazine article combiningOswald’s obituary and biography was titled: THE MAN WHO KILLED KENNEDY.The presumption of Oswald’s guilt was cemented by the February 21, 1964, editionof Life, which carried one of the infamous backyard photos on its cover with thecaption, “Lee Oswald with the weapons he used to kill President Kennedy andOfficer Tippit.” This issue was in the hands of the public nearly eight monthsbefore the Warren Commission emerged from behind closed doors and proclaimedOswald the lone assassin.Later, Life devoted much of its October 2, 1964, issue to coverage of thejust-released Warren Report. Rather than assigning a staff member to evaluatethe report, Life editors chose Representative Gerald Ford, himself a Commissionmember, to review his own work.In that same issue, a still frame from the Zapruder film depicting Kennedy’srearward fall at that moment of the head shot was substituted with an earlierframe that gave no indication of the direction his head moved.One Life editor, Ed Kearns, was later asked about the changes. He toldassassination researcher Vincent Salandria, “I am at a loss to explain thediscrepancies between the three versions of Life which you cite. I’ve heard ofbreaking a [printing] plate to correct an error. I’ve never heard of doing ittwice for a single issue, much less a single story. Nobody here seems toremember who worked on the early Kennedy story.”On September 27, 1964, the Warren Report was released to near-unanimous praisefrom the national news media, the primary source of public information. The NewYork Times even went to the expense of publishing the entire report as asupplement to its September 28 edition. The paper then published both ahardcover and paperback edition of the report in collaboration with Bantam Booksand the Book of the Month Club.Two months later, the Times again sought to lead the public’s understanding ofthe assassination by helping publish The Witnesses, consisting of “highlights”of Warren Commission testimony. After studying this publication, assassinationresearcher Jerry Policoff wrote:The selection and editing of testimony for this volume showed a clearunderstanding of that evidence which supported the Warren Commission findingsand that which did not. Testimony which fit into the latter category was editedout in a manner which could hardly have been accidental. . . . In short, avolume purporting to be an objective condensation of relevant testimony compiledby America’s “newspaper of record” was little more than deliberately slantedpropaganda in support of the Warren Commission Report.Respected researcher Sylvia Meagher complained, “The Witnesses, therefore, wasone of the most biased offerings ever to masquerade as objective information. Inpublishing this paperback, The Times engaged in uncritical partisanship, theantithesis of responsible journalism.”By 1966, so much controversy had been generated by researchers critical of theWarren Report that Richard Billings, then Life’s associate editor in charge ofinvestigative reporting, was ordered to look more closely at certain aspects ofthe assassination, particularly the “single-bullet” theory.After analyzing the Zapruder film, Billings’s staff concluded that theone-bullet theory was untenable and, in its November 25, 1966, issue, Lifecalled for a new investigation.However, another part of Time-Life Corporation, Time magazine, in its November25, 1966, issue editorialized against the “phantasmagoria” of Warren Commissioncritics and concluded, “There seems little valid excuse for so dramatic adevelopment as another full-scale inquiry.”Asked about these conflicting editorial postures, Hedley Donovan, editor inchief of both Time and Life, responded, “We would like to see our magazinesarrive at consistent positions on major issues, and I am sure in due course wewill on this one.”This reconciliation occurred two months later when Billings said he was told bya superior, “It is not Life’s function to investigate the Kennedyassassination.” Similar admonitions have been echoed in newsrooms throughoutAmerica over the intervening years. Billings’s investigation was terminated andthe November 25 article, which was to have been the first of a series, becamethe last.The one television network that continually backed the Warren Commission versionof the assassination was CBS, where newsman Dan Rather served as one of theanchors on assassination reports since 1967. Rather was one of the only newsreporters who managed to see the Zapruder film in the days following theassassination and falsely reported at the fatal head shot his head “went forwardwith considerable violence.”In a 1967 assassination documentary, CBS conducted a series of tests designed toprove that Oswald could have fired his rifle in the time established by theWarren Commission. When these tests essentially failed to support thiscontention, narrator Walter Cronkite nevertheless reported, “It seems reasonableto say that an expert could fire that rifle in five seconds. It seems equallyreasonable to say that Oswald, under normal circumstances, would take longer.But these were not normal circumstances. Oswald was shooting at a president.”Cronkite’s mistake was the same as that of the Warren Commission and later theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations—a presumption of Oswald’s guilt guidedhis interpretation.Of course, a presumption of Oswald’s innocence would have led investigators intoa confrontation with government agencies, the military, big business, andpowerful politicians.Therefore, the major news media have been content to let sleeping assassinationconspiracies lie, compounding this timidity by characterizing anyone who daredlook hard at the case as a “buff,” “fantasist,” “theorist,” or “sensationalist.”In the Dallas area, for instance, diligent reporters were warned off theassassination story by superiors despite a continuing spate of new developmentsand information.Early on there was some excuse for this pathetic media track record. Newsreporters in the early 1960s were used to getting their information fromofficial sources and did not suspect that these same sources might lie to them.Questioning the word of J. Edgar Hoover was tantamount to blasphemy.When news reporters from all over the world descended on Dallas, they were atthe mercy of local and federal authorities. They didn’t know the city or itsleaders and they didn’t know how to talk to its residents. So the bulk ofreporters waited in the police station for the next official pronouncement.Oswald’s brother Robert noticed and commented in his book, Lee:It seemed to me that the police, who should be conducting a carefulinvestigation to discover just what had happened and how deeply Lee might beinvolved, had instead surrendered to the mob of reporters, photographers andtelevision cameramen. I knew that these men from the newspapers, magazines andtelevision networks were workingmen, just like I was, and I could not blame themfor carrying out their assignments. But I could and did blame the Dallas PoliceDepartment for its failure to retain any control over the situation. The mostcasual remark by any of the investigators or police officers was broadcast tothe world immediately, without any effort being made to determine whether it wassomebody’s wild speculation, a theory that deserved further investigation or afact supported by reliable evidence.Independent investigating was virtually nonexistent. The few reporters who daredinvestigate moved on quickly to another topic after realizing the power arrangedagainst them.Author Leonard Sanders was a young reporter in the Dallas area at the time. Hetold this author that he discontinued investigating the assassination afterbecoming convinced that his telephone was tapped and his movements monitored.In the late 1970s, Dallas Morning News investigative reporter Earl Golz wasactually ordered not to write about the Kennedy assassination again. This orderwas later ignored in the wake of revelations made public by the House SelectCommittee on Assassinations. This author once was told not to write any moreabout the Kennedy assassination as it was “upsetting people at the PetroleumClub,” a private club for persons connected to the oil industry.In this type of atmosphere, it is no wonder that the public remains confusedabout the facts of Kennedy’s death.As researcher Jerry Policoff wrote, “The Kennedy Assassination cover-up hassurvived so long only because the press, confronted with the choice of believingwhat it was told or examining the facts independently, chose the former.”[images/line.jpg]Sensing a power shift at the highest levels of government and commerce, themajor news media—like other official segments of American society—simply failedto function properly in response to the assassination of President Kennedy.The normal police function was subordinated to pressure from the federalgovernment. The usual legal precautions to protect against wrongful conviction,such as a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, cross-examination ofevidence and witnesses, and the securing of defense counsel for the accused,were bypassed in the case of Lee Harvey Oswald.The possibility of wrongdoing at the top of this nation’s political structurepanicked otherwise honest leadership in local, state, and federal government.Major business leaders, sensing the enormity of what had happened, kept theirpeace.Never had the old saying “Who will watch the watchers?” carried more meaning.What essentially began as a plot by a few fearful and greedy men grew into afull-scale palace revolt—a national coup d’état aided by the business, banking,industrial, media, and defense communities that played no active role in theplot. The results of this revolt were accepted by the “status quo”—theEstablishment—after the fact.The seventeenth-century courtier Sir John Harington, inventor of the flushtoilet, summed it up when he wrote the oft-repeated epigram:  Treason doth never prosper: what’s the reason?  Why, if it prosper, none dare call it treason.A Likely Scenario [Contents.html#rsec101]Since so much information concerning the plot to kill Kennedy has beendestroyed, altered, or masked by false leads, it remains impossible to statewith authority details of the plan. Even those involved were probably notinformed of every aspect of the plot.However, there is enough information available today to begin to construct alikely scenario of what happened.Because of his family’s great wealth, John F. Kennedy was incorruptible bybribes and when his father suffered a stroke, all control over him was lost. By1963, it had become quite clear that Kennedy was determined to be his own man.Speaking to the United Auto Workers on May 8, 1962, Kennedy proclaimed:I know there are some people who . . . believe that the President of the UnitedStates should be honorary chairman of a great fraternal organization and confinehimself to ceremonial functions. . . . But that is not what the Constitutionsays. And I did not run for President of the United States to fulfill thatoffice in that way. . . . I believe it is the business of the President toconcern himself with the general welfare.He also was the only president since Franklin Roosevelt who was an intellectual.Kennedy had a rich sense of history and a global outlook. With Mary Meyer, hehad gained an idealistic vision of making the world more peaceful and lesscorrupt. In other words, he really believed he was president and he set out toshake up the status quo of Big Banking, Big Oil, Big Military-Industrial Complexwith its powerful intelligence community, and Big Organized Crime, which hadgained deep inroads into American life since Prohibition.There is also the argument that Kennedy was opposed to Israel’s development ofnuclear weapons and was demanding inspections of Israel’s Dimona nuclear plant,a position that alienated powerful Zionists.The new directions being taken by the young president provoked serious talkagainst him within many groups—organized crime, the anti-Castro Cubans, the CIA,business and banking, the oil industry, and even the military. There were manyconnections among all these groups—particularly in Operation Mongoose, thesecret war against Castro. Once word of this pervasive anti-Kennedy feelingreached the ears of certain members of the southwestern oil and businesscommunities, secret meetings were held where money was raised. Tacit approvalwas given by the ruling financiers of Wall Street, where Council on ForeignRelations members led by David Rockefeller had railed against Kennedy’s economicpolicies. A consensus was reached that Kennedy was a threat and had to go.From this point on, there would be no further contact between the individualswho initiated the plot and those who carried it out. Consequently, there islittle likelihood that the originators of the plot will ever be identified orbrought to justice. However, the broad outlines of the plot can be discerned bydiligent study of all available assassination information.There remain numerous ties among all of these powerful factions. It is now welldocumented that the mob and the CIA worked together on many types of operations,including assassination. The various US intelligence services were closelyinterwoven, and in some cases, such as the National Security Agency, weresuperior to the FBI and CIA.Therefore, when Kennedy and his brother attorney general Robert Kennedy began towage war on organized crime, to the mob and the industries it controlled and thebanks that handled their money this quickly became a matter of self-defense, thestrongest motivation for killing.Officials of the FBI and CIA likewise feared the Kennedys, who had come torealize how dangerously out of control these agencies had become. Theanti-Castro Cubans felt betrayed by Kennedy because of his orders stopping USmilitary assistance to the Bay of Pigs invaders and were quite willing tosupport an assassination.However, no matter how violent or powerful these crime-intelligence-industrialcliques might have been, they never would have moved against this nation’s chiefexecutive without the approval of—or at the very least the neutralization of—theUS military and its greatest political supporter, vice president Lyndon BainesJohnson, former chairman of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee.Already angered by Kennedy’s liberal domestic policies, the Bay of Pigs fiasco,and his signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union, topmilitary brass undoubtedly were incensed in late 1963 when Kennedy let it beknown that he planned to withdraw all US military personnel from Vietnam by theend of 1965. The military leadership turned against him.The stage was set. General Charles Cabell, the CIA deputy director Kennedy firedafter the Bay of Pigs, was back in the Pentagon, and his brother, Earle Cabell,was mayor of Dallas.It was widely rumored that Vice President Johnson—long associated with dirtypolitics, gamblers, and defense officials, and facing jail because ofscandal—was to be dropped from the Democratic ticket in 1964. Texas oilmen,staunch friends of Johnson and the military-industrial complex, were dismayedthat Kennedy was talking about doing away with the lucrative oil-depletionallowance.International bankers were shocked when Kennedy ordered the Treasury Departmentto print its own money, rather than distributing interest-bearing FederalReserve notes. Soldiers, mobsters, and conniving businessmen feared their applecart was about to be upset by this youthful president.So the decision was made at the highest level of the Americanbusiness-banking-politics-military-crime power structure that should anythinghappen to Kennedy, it would be viewed as a blessing for the nation, andcertainly for them.And simply voting him out of office wouldn’t suffice. After all, what was tostop someone from carrying on his policies? Two more Kennedys—Robert andEdward—were waiting in the wings for their turn at the presidency. A Kennedy“dynasty” was in place.Therefore, the decision was made to eliminate John F. Kennedy by means of apublic execution for the same reason criminals are publicly executed—to serve asa deterrent to anyone considering following in his footsteps.Unlike the Roman senator Brutus who participated in the stabbing of Caesar, themen at the top of this consensus didn’t even have to risk getting their handsbloody.Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty—a former Pentagon-CIA liaison officer and longtimeassassination researcher—explained that most assassinations are set in motionnot so much by a specific plan to kill as by efforts to remove or relax theprotection around a target.Prouty noted:No one has to direct an assassination—it happens. The active role is playedsecretly by permitting it to happen. That was why President Kennedy was killed.He was not murdered by some lone gunman or by some limited conspiracy, but bythe breakdown of the protective system that should have made an assassinationimpossible. . . . Once insiders knew that he would not be protected, it was easyto pick the day and the place. . . . All the conspirators had to do was let theright “mechanics” [professional assassins] know where Kennedy would be and whenand, most importantly, that the usual precautions would not have been made andthat escape would be facilitated. This is the greatest single clue to theassassination—Who had the power to call off or reduce the usual securityprecautions that are always in effect whenever a president travels? Castro didnot kill Kennedy, nor did the CIA. The power source that arranged that murderwas on the inside. It had the means to reduce normal security and permit thechoice of a hazardous route. It also had the continuing power to cover thatcrime for . . . years.Operational orders most probably originated with ranking members of thegovernment elite, men such as Allen Dulles and Cord Meyer, and military officerslike Generals Charles Cabell and Curtis LeMay and Johnson’s military aide,Colonel Howard Burris. Actual planning was tasked to men knowledgeable in theways of state assassins, such as the CIA’s William Harvey, David Atlee Phillips,and General Edward Lansdale of Operation Mongoose, that nexus of the military,mobsters, CIA operatives, and anti-Castro Cubans. Organized-crime chieftainssuch as Carlos Marcello and his associates Santos Trafficante and Sam Giancanawere contacted. They already were involved with the CIA and provided personneland logistics.But these mob bosses were smart. They realized the consequences if their role inKennedy’s death should ever become known. Therefore, they insisted that elementswithin the government be involved. Several separate assassination plots wereinitiated.A world-class assassin was recruited—perhaps Michael Victor Mertz, the shadowyFrenchman with both crime and intelligence connections, or even an unknown butcompetent shooter like John Christian.Slowly, as the true assassination plot began to come together, word must havereached the ears of J. Edgar Hoover, a power unto himself with plenty of causeto hate the Kennedy brothers. Hoover was in contact with his close friend LyndonJohnson and with Texas oilmen such as H. L. Hunt and Clint Murchinson of Dallas.His agents and informers were in daily contact with mob figures.Operatives from both intelligence and the mob were recruited. Many were like theCIA’s David Morales, Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis, and David Ferrie in thatthey had connections to criminal circles as well as to US intelligence andanti-Castro Cubans. It was a military-style operation in that overall knowledgeof the plot was kept on a strict need-to-know basis. Many people on the lowerend of the conspiracy truthfully could say they didn’t know exactly whathappened.To distract public attention from the real conspirators a scapegoat—or patsy—wasneeded. Enter Lee Harvey Oswald, a patriotic young man who followed thetradition of his father and brothers by voluntarily joining the US militarywhere apparently he was recruited into US intelligence, first through the Officeof Naval Intelligence and then on to the CIA. Whether the Dallas Oswald was aSoviet agent or a US agent posing as a procommunist, he was the perfect patsyfor the assassination. As an intelligence agent, he would have followed ordersand easily could have been manipulated into incriminating himself as theassassin. Furthermore, his position as a spy would have prevented the Russiansfrom proclaiming the truth of the assassination to their world, since they couldhardly be expected to admit their knowledge of Oswald.Once the idea of conspiracy is acknowledged, questions of who fired a gun, fromwhat location, and how many times become irrelevant. Much more important are thequestions of who benefited from the assassination and had the ability to coverup the truth.It appears there may have been two serious slip-ups for the conspirators. First,it appears unlikely that as many as three shots were intended. More likely theassassination was to have been constructed so that it would appear that Kennedywas killed by one lucky shot from the Depository. The conspirators, of course,would have been prepared to fire another volley if necessary. Second, it isequally likely that their scapegoat, Oswald, was to have been killed by aconspirator during return fire by Kennedy’s security men. However, there was noreturn fire and Oswald managed to slip away from the Depository.When the shooting started, confusion was rampant. No one except the conspiratorsknew what was happening, and the Dallas police radio channel used for thepresidential motorcade security was blocked for more than eight minutes due toan open microphone.The true assassins simply strolled away, after dumping their rifles into nearbycar trunks or passing them to confederates. One weapon may have been hidden downa water drain pipe on the Grassy Knoll, as a section of the pipe collapsed manyyears later. It had been cut open but not welded when replaced and the cityclaimed no knowledge of this activity.Oswald may well have been exactly where he said he was during theshooting—safely out of sight in the downstairs lunchroom of the Depository.Perhaps he had been told to wait for a telephone call at that time. He may havestrayed by briefly stepping up a short flight of stairs and peeking out thefront door of the Depository where he was captured in the Altgens photograph.Oswald left the Depository and made his way to his South Oak Cliff roominghouse, where he retrieved his pistol to defend himself. His landlady said thatwithin minutes of his arrival, he hurried from his room after a Dallas policecar stopped out front and beeped its horn twice. It now seems likely that it wasDallas patrolman J. D. Tippit who picked up Oswald around the corner from hisrooming house and drove him to the Texas Theater, which explained why he wasunseen en route.The slaying of Tippit may have played some part in this scheme to have Oswaldkilled, perhaps to eliminate co-conspirator Tippit or simply to anger Dallaspolice and cause itchy trigger fingers.Regardless, Tippit was killed by someone other than Oswald. Whoever shot Tippitmeant to kill him, not simply escape a policeman. The HSCA determined that oneshot was fired point-blank into his head, a coup de grâce.Oswald, who was given every opportunity to flee through a rear exit of the TexasTheater, instead was captured alive, creating a bad situation for theconspirators. Oswald could not be permitted to stand trial and possibly revealhis true connections.Jack Ruby—the mob’s “bag man” in Dallas and the man who apparently handled fundsfor the local activities of the assassination conspirators—received his ordersto kill Oswald from organized-crime leaders eager to protect the secret of theircontract, and there were no alternatives for a mob directive.The key to understanding the Oswald slaying is not that Ruby somehow knew whenOswald was to be transported from the police station, but rather that the Oswaldtransfer was delayed until Ruby was in position—thanks to mob influence in theDallas Police Department, one of the nation’s most corrupt at that time. TheHouse Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Ruby most likely enteredthe police basement down a back stairway with the assistance of one or morepolicemen.One shot and Oswald was dead. A cover-up began immediately, leaving only hismother to question the official version of the assassination.While this scenario can be disputed, it nevertheless represents the onlynarrative that conforms to all of the known facts.[images/line.jpg]Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as president within two hours of theassassination.His first act as president was to violate the laws of his own state by orderingthe removal of Kennedy’s body from Parkland Hospital over the objections of theDallas County medical examiner who was required by law to conduct an inquest. Bythat evening, Johnson was exerting undue influence over the Dallas investigationboth directly and through his aides.Within two weeks, Johnson had coerced a reluctant chief justice Earl Warren intoheading a special presidential commission charged with finding Oswald aloneguilty of the deed. The creation of the Warren Commission effectively blockedseveral other assassination investigations in both Texas and Washington.The Warren Commission, composed of captains of both intelligence and corporatebusiness—with representative Gerald Ford spying on behalf of Hoover’s FBI—paidprecious little attention to anything that did not tend to prove the “lone-nutassassin” theory. The Commission had no staff of independent investigators. Itrelied almost entirely on the FBI and CIA for information. Both agencies, alongwith the Secret Service, today have been officially chastised for concealingevidence from the two government investigations.Government investigators found a virtual smorgasbord of assassination evidenceavailable in Dallas and New Orleans. By carefully selecting data that fit theofficial version of a lone gunman, they were able to present a believable—ifuntruthful—account of Kennedy’s death.Meanwhile, a documented campaign of intimidation of witnesses began in Dallas.Some were simply told to keep quiet while others died under unusualcircumstances. While some of this suppression might be blamed on mob thugs, manypeople in Dallas have claimed that it was FBI agents who warned them not to talkabout the assassination—an odd admonition since officially it was the work ofjust one troubled man. This theory was presented despite embarrassing evidenceindicating Oswald was an informant for the FBI.There is now abundant evidence that Hoover’s FBI destroyed critical evidence inthis case, suppressed other evidence, and intimidated witnesses. The FBI solelydirected the verdict that Oswald acted alone.There was never a real cover-up of the assassination, only officialpronouncements for the major mass media and lots of red herrings for diligentinvestigators.As long as the US government backed by a supportive Establishment and corporatemedia refuses to seek and reveal the truth of what happened on November 22,1963, it will be up to individual Americans to cull through the mounds ofKennedy assassination material and find the elusive truth for themselves.Who done it? Powerful men in leadership positions within the majorcorporate-military-defense-intelligence communities and the bankers who fundthem, along with associated organized-crime bosses, reached a consensus thatKennedy was a danger to the status quo and had to be eliminated. Their faithfulagents manipulated Mafia-Cuban-CIA pawns to kill the chief.President Kennedy was killed in a military-style ambush orchestrated by elementswithin the US government that included the military with the active assistanceof organized crime.Pressure from the top thwarted any truthful investigation.It was an American coup d’état.[images/line.jpg]This is no theory, which is informed speculation based on supposition. Ifsomething is provable, it is no longer a theory. The information presentedwithin this book substantiates the fact that in 1963 US government policies werechanged through an act of violence.Even today there is still pressure from the top of the American power structureto keep the lid on this sordid affair. Many officials who continue to obscurethe Kennedy case played no part in the assassination conspiracy. They simply donot want to alert the American public to the corruption found in theinterconnections between government, big business, the military, intelligence,and the mob. It might prove bad for business.What then is the legacy of president John F. Kennedy? The fact is that we willnever know. His presidency always will be remembered, not for what he did, butfor what he might have done.But it may be worth considering what kind of America we might have today ifPresident Kennedy had lived. Imagine the United States if there had been nodivisive Vietnam War, with its attendant demonstrations, riots, deaths, and lossof faith in government. There may not have been the scandals of Watergate, otherpolitical assassinations, or the Iran-Contra Pentagon-CIA attempt at a “secretgovernment.” No 9/11 attacks with the ensuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. NoAmerican “Reich” with military operations spanning the globe. Détente withcommunist Russia and China might have come years earlier, saving hundreds ofmillions of wasted defense dollars—dollars that could have been put to usecaring for the needy and cleaning up the environment. Picture a nation where noorganized-crime syndicate gained control over such divergent areas of nationallife as drugs, gambling, labor unions, politicians, and even toxic wastedisposal.Is it possible to consider that we might have had a nation where peace andprosperity were achieved without the need for a massive military buildup, orthat we might have experienced a kinder and gentler nation all along?John F. Kennedy was no superman. Today there seems to be a movement to focusattention on the “morality” of his private life. But history will eventuallyrecord that Kennedy truly believed he had the best interests of his nation atheart. He wanted to lead America forward into a peaceful and prosperous future.Kennedy was in the mold of Mikhail Gorbachev, complete with his own Americanbrand of glasnost, or openness with the public. But he was premature. America—atleast the backstage rulers of America—was not ready for such innovation.The emperor has no clothes on—or in this case, American business and politicalemperors wear bloodstained clothing—but no one of any prominence wants to be thefirst to say so.Members of Kennedy’s inner circle also came to understand what had reallyhappened. But this knowledge came too late. The proof had been taken up and theyrealized the extent of the power arrayed against them. Some kept their peace,some soon retired from government, and others left the country.No one was closer to President Kennedy and his work than his secretary EvelynLincoln. She was at his elbow constantly, yet no one in America can recallseeing a nationwide interview with her. This is probably because, as she wrotein a 1994 letter, “it is my belief that there was a conspiracy. . . . These fiveconspirators, in my opinion, were Lyndon B. Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, the Mafia,the CIA and the Cubans in Florida.”Robert Kennedy also came to understand the tremendous power behind the events inDallas. On June 3, 1968, just two days before his own assassination, the youngerKennedy told close friends, “I now fully realize that only the powers of thepresidency will reveal the secrets of my brother’s death.”He obviously had come to realize that the truth of John Kennedy’s death couldcome only after Robert Kennedy gained control over the FBI, CIA, Secret Service,and the Pentagon—all of which had become powers unto themselves.Surely no one believes it was sheer coincidence that the younger Kennedy wasgunned down the very night he received the 1968 California Democratic nominationfor president, which most probably would have clinched his national nomination.While it may be too late for justice for John F. Kennedy, it is never too latefor the truth. Camelot was killed from within, by men whose fear and ambitionoverpowered their faith in and loyalty to the US Constitution and the people itwas designed to protect.After assimilating the information in this book, the thoughtful reader can nowperceive the truth of the Kennedy assassination. An apt precedent may be foundin William Shakespeare’s immortal Julius Caesar, where Roman leaders—”allhonorable men”—plotted to kill Caesar out of fear that they were losing totalpower in their country. Brutus defended his participation by explaining, “Notthat I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.” Or to paraphrase theAmerican officer in Vietnam who defended the destruction of a village there, “Inorder to save the country, they had to destroy it.”Until the public forces politicians, academics, and the corporate mass media toconfront the reality of Kennedy’s death and the power behind it, the wars,near-wars, the wasteful military buildup, foreign adventurism, death, squanderedmillions, trampled human rights, moral decline, environmental pollution, and thesavaging of the US Constitution will continue.The path to a confrontation with the evil that has gained a hold on America lieswithin each individual citizen—in our minds and, perhaps more important, in ourhearts.One can still hear the sad spirit of John F. Kennedy echoing from Dealey Plaza:Et tu, Lyndon?"},{"pageContent":"SOURCES AND NOTES [Contents.html#rbm1]In a work such as this, extensive footnoting within the text can often impedethe flow of ideas, reducing comprehension.There are further problems in the case of the JFK assassination. Too oftenofficial government reports do not accurately reflect the actual evidence orstatements of witnesses.Major statements in this work or ones that contradict the official version ofthe assassination are attributed in this section. Usually only one reference isgiven, though multiple sources may be found in most instances.Any statements without attribution or a source listing indicate historical factor issues that are undisputed among the majority of credible assassinationresearchers.Accounts of witnesses sometimes represent a synthesis of their words from morethan one source. It should be pointed out that just because a statement isattributed to some source does not make that statement true. People’s accountscan result from mistakes as well as lies due to fear and intimidation.WC Report refers to the Warren Commission Report, while its attendant hearingsand exhibits are referred to by volume and page—for example, XXII.644.Similarly, the House Select Committee on Assassinations volumes will appear asHSCA VIII.64.It is significant to add that while all assassination works—including thisbook—must rely heavily on official government reports and publications, suchreports can often be called into question. Therefore, the burden of separatingfact from fiction must unfortunately fall on the reader. This sad factnecessitates access to the broadest amount of information, often going farbeyond official sources.A comprehensive bibliography of sources for Crossfire may be found at theJimMarrs.com [http://JimMarrs.com] website.PART I: THE KILL ZONEDallas—The Stage Is SetThe Thirty-fifth President2 [Chapter001.html#page_2] JFK’s affair with suspected Nazi agent: JohnH.
