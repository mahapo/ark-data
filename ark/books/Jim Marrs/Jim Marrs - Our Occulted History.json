We live on a placid island of ignorance inthe midst of a black sea of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyagefar. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed uslittle; but some day the piecing together of disassociated knowledge will openup such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein,that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly lightinto the peace and safety of a new dark age.—HOWARD PHILLIPS LOVECRAFT,The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories LET’S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT RIGHT OFF. THIS BOOK HAS nothing to do with storiesof vampires, werewolves, devil worship, witchcraft, or anything else commonlythought to be of the occult, although there is an unearthly aspect.Many believers choose to put their faith in such stories, but there is anothernarrative growing in the public consciousness that can no longer be written offas mere fable: the idea that aliens from outer space or other dimensions mayhave—or may be trying to—take control of the world.The word occult, often misconstrued to mean supernatural or magical, actually isdefined simply as hidden or concealed. Even so, the word also involves aconnection to outer space or the heavens. In astronomical terms, the termocculted equates to an eclipse, in which one heavenly body is masked, or hidden,behind another.What history is being hidden from us? It would appear that something nonhumanseeks to control the planet Earth and may even have contributed to the advent ofmodern humankind.The field of entertainment is no stranger to this idea. The television series Vpresented benign humanlike aliens visiting Earth, who turn out to be a reptilianrace set on conquering our world. Movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers andbooks like Robert A. Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters have depicted humanstransformed into zombielike pod people after an alien invasion. But theseseemingly outrageous concepts haven’t always been the stuff of pulp fantasynovels or television scripts. Rather, they’ve been considered seriously by manypeople at different times throughout our history.David Icke, author of the The Biggest Secret, has built a large worldwidefollowing with his claims that certain world leaders, including the Britishroyals, are shape-shifting reptilian aliens who have been on Earth since beforewritten history. According to Icke, these leaders have descended from manygenerations of reptilian aliens. “A race of interbreeding [reptile-human hybrid]bloodlines … were centered in the Middle East and Near East in the ancientworld,” wrote Icke, “and, over the thousands of years since, have expanded theirpower across the globe … [through] a network of mystery schools and secretsocieties … creating institutions like religions to mentally and emotionallyimprison the masses and set them at war with each other.”Lest one believe such talk comes only from loony fanatics, consider that noneother than the famed scientist Carl Sagan wrote at length in his book TheDragons of Eden about the reptilian complex, which tops the brain stem, theoldest part of the human brain. Sagan said this part is the “seat of aggression,ritual, territoriality and social hierarchy which evolved millions of years agoin our reptilian ancestors.” He equated such characteristics with modern humanbureaucratic and political behavior.The idea that surreptitious space aliens want to take over the planet has beenaround since long before David Icke. A 1952 issue of Weird Science, apublication of the fabled Educational Comics (EC) that was shut down in theearly 1950s due to the advent of the Comics Code, carried a story in which AllieGator, a takeoff on the alligator character in the then-popular TV puppetprogram Kukla, Fran and Ollie, was elected president following a joke write-incampaign. Allie turned out to be the leading element of a reptilian alien forcebent on taking over the Earth.Much earlier and on a more somber note, journalist Charles Fort declared, “Ithink we’re property.” Fort was an American writer who from 1916 until his deathin 1932 researched and wrote about a large number of “anomalous phenomena,” alofty term for artifacts and events that evade conventional explanation.In his 1919 work, The Book of the Damned, Fort explained that by “damned” hemeant that we, humans, have been excluded from certain knowledge. “I shouldsay,” he continued, “we belong to something. That once upon a time, this Earthwas No-Man’s Land, that other worlds explored and colonized here, and foughtamong themselves for possession, but that now it’s owned by something: Thatsomething owns this Earth—all others warned off. … I suspect … that all of thishas been known, perhaps for ages, to certain ones upon the earth, a cult ororder, members of which function like bellwethers to the rest of us, or assuperior slaves or overseers, directing us in accordance with instructionsreceived—from Somewhere else—in our mysterious usefulness.”Fort compiled such a prodigious amount of data covering unusual events that hisbooks are still in print. His followers founded the Fortean Society in 1931,which continues to exist and publishes Fortean Times. The very words Fortean andForteana have entered the English language, referring to the strange andunexplainable.But it was Swiss journalist Erich von Däniken, with his 1968 book, Chariots ofthe Gods, who brought the concept of “ancient astronauts”—visitors who came toour world during the Stone Age to help perpetuate the human race—to a globalaudience.Two questions arise from Fort’s and von Däniken’s writings. How warranted weretheir condemnations of the unwillingness of conventional science to investigateunconventional phenomena? And more important, how right were they about theconcept of nonhuman control?One of the most prominent websites for skeptics acknowledges ancient mysteriesbut shuns the idea of ancient astronauts, merely stating, “It is true that westill do not know how the ancients accomplished some of their more astoundingphysical and technological feats. We still wonder how the ancient Egyptiansraised giant obelisks in the desert and how stone age men and women moved hugecut stones and placed them in position in dolmens and passage graves. We areamazed by the giant carved heads on Easter Island and wonder why they were done,who did them, and why they abandoned the place. We may someday have the answersto our questions, but they are most likely to come from scientific investigationnot pseudoscientific speculation.”Others have concluded that standard science may not offer the right tools tofigure out our past. Following a lifetime of research, author Philip Coppensconcluded in his 2012 book, The Ancient Alien Question, that the manner in whichscience has considered the question of nonhuman contact in our distant past is“not the correct, or at least not the only, approach. When we look at realitythe way it is, rather than within the reduced framework in which science prefersto operate, it becomes clear that there is only one answer. Were we alone? No.”William Bramley, in his 1990 book, The Gods of Eden, said he began studying thecauses of war but came to the conclusion that “Human beings appear to be a slaverace languishing on an isolated planet in a small galaxy.” He added that “thehuman race was once a source of labor for an extraterrestrial civilization andstill remains a possession today. To keep control over its possession and tomaintain Earth as something of a prison, that other civilization [Bramley calledthem Custodians] has bred never-ending conflict between human beings, haspromoted human spiritual decay, and has erected on Earth conditions ofunremitting physical hardship. This situation has lasted for thousands of yearsand it continues today.”After more than 360 pages cataloging evidence of possible ancient nonhumanvisitation on Earth, author, psychologist, and ordained Baptist minister PaulVon Ward in his 2011 book, We Have Never Been Alone, concluded that “enoughevidence of AB [Advanced Beings] involvement in human history exists that noresponsible student of the human past and present can dismiss it in goodconscience.”Australian researcher Paul White saw the involvement of nonhumans as the basisof ancient legends and myths worldwide. “Just after the Deluge, at the dawn ofthe present time cycle, an era the Egyptians called ZEP TEPI, ‘The First Times,’a mysterious group of ‘gods’ appeared, to initiate the survivors in therudiments of civilisation. From Thoth and Osiris in Egypt, to Quetzalcoatl andViracocha in the Americas, traditions worldwide subscribe [sic] the origins ofcontemporary civilisation to this sophisticated group.”“Evidence from around the world, indicates these people were the hi-techsurvivors of the previous civilisation of what we now refer to as Atlantis andMu. Like the nuclear survival bunkers and secret research facilities of our owncivilisation, there were those who arose from the underground ‘cities of theGods,’ after the dust settled. These survivors are characterised in the Bible asthe ‘prediluvian patriarchs,’ like Enoch and Methuselah, the ‘giants and heroesof old,’ mentioned in Genesis. These are the ‘fabled gods’ of ancient Summer[sic], Egypt and India.”Is there any historical or archaeological evidence to support such beliefs?There is, and it’s compelling, though it contradicts many of our conventionalhistories and beliefs. This is good. After all, at one time, conventional beliefwas that the earth was flat and the center of the universe.If humankind’s progress has been a long, slow climb from hunter-gatherers tomodern empires, then the historical record should not describe much out of theordinary. But the account introduced here—culled from ancient texts, tablets,and carvings found scattered throughout the world—tells a different story, oneof visitors from the stars colonizing the Earth. From the flying sky gods of theMiddle East to the destructive vimanas described in the Hindu Vedic texts,almost all ancient legends tell of flying objects under intelligent control.They also describe strange visitors who taught language, law, mathematics,agriculture, and building construction to primitive humans.Strange and mysterious artifacts and structures abound throughout the world,from the Nasca lines etched in the dry plains of Peru to the pyramids found notonly on the Giza Plateau but in Central and South America, China, easternEurope, and even Arkansas. Odd-shaped skulls and ancient small statues of whatappear to be aircraft are written off as mere anomalies. Researchers continuallystumble over anomalies. By dictionary definition, an anomaly is a circumstanceor thing that is irregular, a deviation from the rule, something abnormal—incomputer slang, a giant scientific WTF! And the world is chock-full of them.If any part of a thesis concerning extraterrestrials or even a prehistoricsupercivilization could be proven true, why haven’t academics and the mass mediareported it? The mass media won’t touch such deep subjects, except in asimplified version that can fill an hour of TV time for entertainment.Convention has viewed such speculation as the province of the occult. Eventoday, many thoughtful and well-documented books languish on the Occult or NewAge shelf in your bookstore right alongside imaginative tomes on vampires,witches, and demons. Common assumptions about what is true are falling away inlight of new and widespread information, primarily from the Internet.So now the word occulted may be viewed in another way—one that reveals howconventional science, and perhaps even institutions administered by the federalgovernment or funded by the wealthy elite, have worked to conceal our possibletrue heritage. This book will address many of the omissions and distortions inour history books, investigating the origins of our solar system and the Earththrough the advent of humankind to our current ruling class. It will examine thehistory of not only our civilization and our culture, but also the science usedto examine our history and the archaeologists and anthropologists who frame theconversations about our species.And if indeed our universe has been populated by nonhumans since its beginningand if they were involved in creating our world and educating our species, thenwe must ask, Did these visitors leave at some point, or are they still among us?If they remain on or near our planet, then what is their agenda for the humanrace? These questions will take us deep into the quest to find our occultedhistory. So turn the page and join the search."},{"pageContent":"PART I [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt01]ORIGINS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt01]Science in its ideology sees itself as doing a fearless exploration of theunknown. Most of the time it is a fearful exploration of the almost known.—RUPERT SHELDRAKE, BIOLOGIST AND ROYAL SOCIETY RESEARCH FELLOW BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHO CONTROLS THE WORLD, WE FIRST need to understand how theworld was created. Most people would agree that our universe was created bysomething, either a heavenly being such as God, Vishnu, Yahweh, Allah, the GreatSpirit, the One or—as atheists might believe—by an accidental convergence ofuniversal subatomic energy.It is after this consensus that the trouble begins. Millennia of warfare andmillions of deaths have resulted from religious disputes over exactly who God isand which people meet God’s approval. There are also the Big Questions asked byhumans down through the ages: Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are wegoing?The answers to such questions may be found in the oldest known accounts of humanhistory—the stone tablets from ancient Sumer, which predate the Bible by morethan three thousand years. They tell of fantastic flying machines, trips toother worlds, destructive battles on Earth and elsewhere, and even the creationof a slave race. There are detailed accounts of gods, goddesses, and demigods,kings and queens, champions, tyrants, priests, holy men, wars, andinsurrections. Beginning with the world’s oldest known story—the quest of thegreat Sumerian king Gilgamesh, who claimed a nonhuman heritage—there existenough tales of battles, court intrigues, jealousies, and adventures to rivalany Hollywood blockbuster.But to understand the reality of these recorded stories, one must start at thebeginning."},{"pageContent":"BIG BANG QUESTIONED [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha01]STANDARD SCIENCE TELLS US THAT OUR UNIVERSE BEGAN WITH THE Big Bang—a burst ofenergy that scientists estimate occurred about 13 billion years ago causingcosmic inflation milliseconds afterward.Despite the scientific community’s overall acceptance of the Big Bang, certainproblems with the theory have come under scrutiny, leading some to question itsvalidity. The cover story of the April 2011 edition of Scientific Americanincluded the article “Quantum Gaps in Big Bang Theory: Why Our Best Explanationof How the Universe Evolved Must Be Fixed—or Replaced.” In the article Paul J.Steinhardt, director of Princeton University’s Center for Theoretical Science,pointed out that astrophysicists have left a number of problems with the theoryunresolved, stating that “the case against [the Big Bang theory] challenges thelogical foundations of the theory. Does the theory really work as advertised?Are the predictions made in the early 1980s still the predictions of theinflationary model as we understand it today? There is an argument to be madethat the answer to both questions is no.”But there have always been other theories, including our universe as a projectof some superuniversal alien entities or the sudden appearance of Earth as anact of God. Anglican archbishop James Ussher, then Primate of All Ireland, setthe tone for the next few centuries concerning the creation of Earth in his 1654book modestly entitled Annals of the World: The Origin of Time, and Continued tothe Beginning of the Emperor Vespasian’s Reign and the Total Destruction andAbolition of the Temple and Commonwealth of the Jews. First published in Latin,this 1,600-page work traced the history of the world from the Garden of Eden tothe fall of Jerusalem in AD 70. Ussher, a dedicated scholar of his time whotraveled throughout Europe studying Church records, determined that ancientpeoples, especially the Israelites, started their calendar at harvest time, sohe chose the first Sunday following the autumnal equinox to begin his history ofthe world. Ussher came to the startling conclusion that the world was created inthe year 4004 BC. John Lightfoot, Master of St. Catherine’s College, Universityof Cambridge, refined Ussher’s calculations, declaring that the creation of theworld occurred at exactly 9:00 a.m. on October 23, 4004 BC. Controversy overthis date continues to this day between those who believe in the absoluteinerrancy of the Bible—and hence Ussher’s calculated date—and those who believethe geological record, which clearly indicates the Earth to be more than 4.5billion years old, and with some evidence of human habitats dated prior to10,000 BC.More than two thousand years before the Bible was put into writing, the creationof the Earth was described on cuneiform tablets by the ancient Sumerians.Starting with the translations of ancient Sumerian tablets by Zecharia Sitchinin the 1970s, many authors have contributed to a more detailed understanding ofthe creation story as recorded by the Sumerians long before the Bible. Thanks toSitchin’s work, as well as that of Erich von Däniken, Michael Tellinger, PaulVon Ward, Alan F. Alford, R. A. Boulay, Neil Freer, Arthur David Horn, JoeLewels, Joseph P. Farrell, David Hatcher Childress, C. L. Turnage, David Icke,Lloyd Pye, Laurence Gardner, and William Bramley, a novel and unconventionalaccount of Earth’s creation has been developing. The new account, based in parton ancient writings, deals with the recurring intrusion of a tenth planet intoour solar system. Traditional science, wedded to its own texts and dogma, hasdismissed these accounts as mere mythology, if not pseudoscience andpseudohistory.SEARCH FOR THE TENTH PLANET [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s01]The search for an unknown planet (Planet X) in our solar system is nothing new.It has continued since at least 1843, when British astronomer John Couch Adamsdeduced through noticeable gravitational disturbances that another planet mustlie beyond Uranus. His observations led to the discovery of Neptune. Scientistscontinued to use this method to deduce the existence of other solar bodies, suchas Pluto, which was discovered in 1930 after gravitational perturbations in theorbit of Neptune were noticed. Initially Pluto was thought to be the long-soughtPlanet X. However, it has since been concluded that the combined mass of Plutoand its major moon, Charon, is too small to exert the observed effect on theorbit of Neptune. Poor Pluto was downgraded in 2006 from a full-fledged planetto a dwarf planet, although some astronomers continue to disagree. The hunt forPlanet X continues.In 1981, American scientists were theorizing the existence of a tenth planet inour system based on sightings by an orbiting telescope and studies ofirregularities in the orbit of Pluto indicating an additional solar body. “Ifnew evidence from the U.S. Naval Observatory of a 10th planet in the solarsystem is correct, it could prove that the Sumerians … were far ahead of modernman in astronomy,” commented Hugh McCann, a writer for the Detroit News.Although the ancient Sumerians call it the twelfth planet, there is noinconsistency, as they counted the moon and the sun as planetary bodies, thusarriving at the number twelve, the same number as their pantheon of spacefaringoverlords, whom they said arrived on Earth from Nibiru.On December 30, 1983, the Washington Post reported on its front page, “Aheavenly body possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly soclose to Earth that it would be part of this solar system has been found in thedirection of the constellation Orion by an orbiting telescope aboard the U.S.Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). So mysterious is the object thatastronomers do not know if it is a planet, a giant comet, a nearby ‘protostar’that never got hot enough to become a star, a distant galaxy so young that it isstill in the process of forming its first stars or a galaxy so shrouded in dustthat none of the light cast by its stars ever gets through. …”Gerry Neugebauer, IRAS chief scientist for California’s Jet PropulsionLaboratory and director of the Palomar Observatory for the California Instituteof Technology, was quoted saying, “All I can tell you is that we don’t know whatit is.”The Caltech scientists believed the large body was fifty billion miles away, amere stone’s throw in astronomical terms, and they speculated that it may beheading toward Earth. Others predicted that it could enter our inner solarsystem, wreaking havoc, in 2012. Perhaps giving an early indication as to howofficialdom would treat such news, Neugebauer told the media, “I want to dousethat idea with as much cold water as I can.”Recently traditional scientists have downplayed or dismissed the idea of Nibiruor any large body invading our solar system. Ian O’Neill, a science writer forUniverse Today who specializes in astrophysics, in 2008 wrote that “any Neptuneorbital perturbations have been put down to observational error and have sincenot been observed … so there doesn’t appear to be any obvious object any biggerthan the largest Kuiper Belt objects out there. … ” The Kuiper Belt is an areaof planetoids and asteroids that lies just outside the orbit of Neptune.O’Neill maintained that IRAS never observed any astronomical body in the outerreaches of the solar system and concluded, “The story that Planet X will arrive[on December 21, 2012] is, in my view, total bunkum (but it helps to selldoomsday books and DVDs by scaring people). Nibiru will remain in the realms ofSumerian myth.” O’Neill acknowledged that rumors have persisted that worldgovernments, including NASA, were hiding the truth of an approaching world. “Sowhy would governments want to hide a ‘discovery’ as historic as a doomsdayplanet approaching the inner Solar System anyway?” he asked, then provided hisown facetious answer, “To avoid mass panic and pursue their own, greedy agendas(obviously).”THE SUMERIAN ACCOUNT—MINGLING OF THE WATERS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s02]The truly amazing fact remains that ancient Sumerians, whom traditional historytells us were just developing writing, accurately described the planets Uranus,Neptune, and Pluto, even though these three worlds cannot be seen without theaid of a telescope. Uranus was not known to modern man until it was discoveredin 1781; Neptune, in 1846; and Pluto, in 1930.Although they have long been considered fanciful myths, recent interpretationsof Mesopotamian texts, particularly one entitled Enuma Elish, known as TheCreation Epic, provided a most plausible explanation for the present compositionof our solar system. “But why not take the epic at face value, as nothing morenor less than the statement of cosmological facts as known to the Sumerians, astold them by the Nefilim?” asked the late Zecharia Sitchin, a graduate of theLondon School of Economics who made a lifelong study of the Sumerian tablets andcarvings. He died in October 2010, leaving behind a sizable following ofdevotees.Sitchin’s revisionist interpretation of the Sumerian texts asserts that morethan four billion years ago, the planets Mercury, Venus, and Mars were closestto the sun. A large watery world called Tiamat was in orbit between Mars andJupiter. Nibiru, a large rogue planet that theoretically travels an ellipticalorbit, entering our system about every 3,600 years, arrived and narrowly missedTiamat. Tiamat cracked under the gravitational stresses. In a subsequent pass byNibiru—in Sitchin’s early works, he refers to this orb by its Babylonian name,Marduk—Tiamat was cleaved in half when one of Nibiru’s moons rammed into theplanet.The collision of Nibiru’s moon and Tiamat knocked a large portion of Tiamat pastMars, ripping away its atmosphere and pieces of matter of various sizes. Thesefragments of Tiamat remained in its original orbit, becoming the familiarasteroid belt, or the Hammered Bracelet or Firmament, as it was called by theancients. The greater portion of Tiamat was knocked into a new orbit closer tothe sun. This larger chunk, retaining much of the planet’s water and carryingmaterial from Mars, coalesced, cooled, and began orbiting between Mars andVenus, becoming Earth. It was accompanied by one of Nibiru’s moons (Kingu),which was captured by Earth’s gravity and became our own satellite. Some say thehuge gouge out of the Earth now encompassing the Pacific Ocean is where thatportion of Tiamat broke apart.The idea is that when Nibiru and Tiamat collided, many tons of sea water fromboth worlds were thrown into space—an event termed the “mingling of the waters”by the Sumerian scribes—along with dirt and debris, all of which became theerratic flying balls of “dirty” ice we call comets.Interestingly enough, this theory could explain why the Earth is missing much ofits crust, particularly on the half encompassing the Pacific Ocean, as well asthe origin of the asteroid belt. This theory also offers an explanation forcomets, which have caused so much speculation among scientists as to theirorigin.This “War of the Worlds” concept has been strengthened by the recent discoveryof meteorites in Antarctica containing the same gases known to compose theatmosphere of Mars and by the discovery by NASA scientists in 1996 of whatappeared to be the remains of microorganisms in a Martian meteorite thought tobe four billion years old.MARTIAN LIFE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s03]The concept of life on Mars got yet another boost when the results of the VikingLander missions of the 1970s were reevaluated in 2009. Photos of the surroundingMartian landscape from Viking 2 showed a thin layer of frost on the ground. Manyscientists now suspect that life-sustaining water might exist as close as teninches under the Martian surface. Retired Viking scientist Patricia Straat toldDiscovery magazine, “A lot of people think there isn’t life on Mars becausethere wasn’t any water on Mars. Our experiment was a definite positive responsefor life, but a lot of people have claimed that it was a false positive for avariety of reasons.”“The idea that all Earth life could be descended from Martian organisms may notbe fully mainstream—but it’s not too crazy to consider, either. While theMartian surface appears to be cold, dry and lifeless today, there is plenty ofevidence that the planet was much warmer and wetter in the distant past,billions of years ago,” stated Mike Wall, senior editor of Space.com. Apparentlyrefuting the claim that Mars is a dead world devoid of life, scientists in 1996announced they discovered evidence of fossilized microbial life in a meteoritefrom Mars called Allan Hills 84001. Although this claim continued to drawcontroversy, many saw this as evidence that humans are not the only livingorganisms in our universe.Astrobiologist Chris McKay of NASA’s Ames Research Center also has supported theconcept that life on Earth might connect to Mars, stating, “It is notimplausible that life on Mars will be related to life on Earth and thereforeshare a common genetics. In any case, it would be important to test thishypothesis.”Researchers in early 2011 were devising an instrument that could search throughsamples of Martian dirt and isolate any genetic material from microbes there.Scientists could then use standard biochemical techniques to compare suchmaterial with that found on Earth. “It’s a long shot,” admitted MIT researcherChris Carr, one of those producing the device. “But if we go to Mars and findlife that’s related to us, we could have originated on Mars. Or if it startedhere, it could have been transferred to Mars.”Scientists have found that 97 percent of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) inhuman cells does not code for proteins and appears to consist of meaningless andrepeating sequences. They are puzzled as to the function of this “junk” DNA.Adding to this conundrum is the speculation of some that this mysterious DNA maybe extraterrestrial in origin.The late Francis Harry Compton Crick, the English molecular biologist whojointly won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his codiscoveryof the structure of the DNA molecule, once suggested that while the developmentof living systems from molecules may be a rare event in the universe, once itdid develop, it may have been spread by spacefaring intelligent life forms in aprocess he called directed panspermia. He postulated, “Life did not evolve firston Earth; a highly advanced civilization became threatened so they devised a wayto pass on their existence. They genetically-modified their DNA and sent it outfrom their planet on bacteria or meteorites with the hope that it would collidewith another planet. It did, and that’s why we’re here. The DNA molecule is themost efficient information storage system in the entire universe. The immensityof complex, coded and precisely sequenced information is absolutely staggering.The DNA evidence speaks of intelligent, information-bearing design.”Crick was not alone is his supposition that Earth may have been seeded with lifeby intelligent beings. “The likelihood of the formation of life from inanimatematter is one to a number with 40,000 naughts after it. … It is big enough tobury Darwin and the whole theory of evolution. There was no primeval soup,neither on this planet nor on any other, and if the beginnings of life were notrandom, they must therefore have been the product of purposeful intelligence,”stated British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle.Sitchin and many others view human DNA differences and defects as support forthe theory that primitive man was genetically altered by nonhumans. If so, wherewould such beings originate? The ancient Sumerian tablets tell us they came fromthat other world they called Nibiru.According to the followers of Sitchin, Nibiru is called the Planet of theCrossing, because its orbit crosses the solar system between Mars and Jupiter.It then proceeds on its elliptical orbit, which takes it far outside the solarsystem before being pulled back by gravitational force. Nibiru has beensymbolized in numerous societies—particularly Egyptian—as a winged disc, acircle with wings stretching to either side.Some scientists claim that a planet that far from a sun could not support life,but others say that if such a planet had a strong confining atmosphere and amolten core like the Earth, it might generate its own life-sustaining heat.Life on Earth evolved based on its one-year orbit around the sun, the solaryear. Researchers theorize that life on Nibiru developed based on its one-yearorbit around the sun—3,600 years to us on Earth. It then stands to reason thatlife on Nibiru would have evolved somewhat sooner than on Earth. Its beings mayalso be long-lived compared to the normal life span of a human, which would seemto be immortal to many insects, with their weeklong lives."},{"pageContent":"STRANGE MOONS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha02]IN ADDITION TO ALTERNATIVE VIEWS ON THE ORIGINS OF EARTH, several scientists andauthors have speculated that as many as three moons in our solar system may notbe natural objects.In 1959, Russian astrophysicist Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky calculated theorbital motion of the Martian satellite Phobos and concluded, based on severalfactors, including its changing speed, that the moon is artificial and hollow.He noted than none of the other moons in our solar system are as small as thetwo Martian moons—Phobos and Deimos—and that both orbit much too close to Mars.Shklovsky realized that Phobos’s velocity and position no longer matched itsmathematically predicted course. The combination of its odd and changingvelocity, coupled with anomalies in its gravitational and magnetic fields, ledShklovsky to conclude that Phobos was nothing less than some sort of hugespacecraft.At the time, the famous astronomer Carl Sagan, who coauthored the 1966 bookIntelligent Life in the Universe with Shklovsky, agreed, stating, “A naturalsatellite cannot be a hollow object.” Sagan argued for serious consideration ofpaleocontact—that is, extraterrestrials in early Earth history—and called forreexamination of myths and religious literature for evidence of such contact. In1960, Sagan was joined by S. Fred Singer, a special adviser on spacedevelopments to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who speculated that Phobos mightbe an orbiting space station. The chief of applied mathematics at NASA, RaymondH. Wilson Jr., joined Shklovsky and Singer, saying that “Phobos might be acolossal base orbiting Mars.”Although in later years Sagan backpedaled from his belief in earlyextraterrestrial contact, he wrote then that “it seems possible that the Earthhas been visited by various Galactic civilizations many times (possibly every10,000 years) during geological time. It is not out of the question thatartifacts of these visits still exist—although none have been found to date—oreven that some kind of base is maintained within the solar system to providecontinuity for successive expeditions.” He added that such visits would requirea base in proximity to Earth and suggested the back side of the moon.Both then and now, conventional scientists have publicly scoffed at the notionof ETs on Earth. But author and publisher Dirk Vander Ploeg has since pointedout that the United States Naval Observatory verified Shklovsky’s calculations.Ploeg interpreted this verification as a concession that mysterious alien shipsmight be orbiting Mars for purposes unknown. “Speculations over what the giantartificial spaceships might be have ranged from massive Martian spaceobservatories, to half-completed generational interstellar spaceships, or evengargantuan planet-killing space bombs left over from an interplanetary war wagedmillions of years ago,” he wrote.IAPETUS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s04]One of the moons of Saturn also has been suspected of containing somethingalien, if not being an artificial spacecraft itself. Iapetus, the planet’s thirdlargest moon, has puzzled researchers since its discovery by Italian astronomerGiovanni Domenico Cassini in 1671. Like our own moon, Iapetus is in anear-perfect circular orbit and one side always faces its planetary host. Buteven more puzzling are square and hexagonal craters that, according to oneformer NASA employee, appear to be gigantic artificial plates holding the moontogether, making Iapetus resemble nothing so much as the Death Star in GeorgeLucas’s film Star Wars.Because of its swirling two-tone coloration—a distinctly dark side and a lightor white side, due to differences in surface reflectivity—Iapetus has beencalled the yin-yang moon, referring to the Chinese symbol indicating aconnectedness even between opposites in the natural world.But the most astonishing aspect of Iapetus is the strange mountainous ridgewhich encircles the equator of the entire moon. Some of the peaks reach nearlythirteen miles in height, making this oddity the tallest mountain range in oursolar system. Despite a number of theories, no one can adequately explain howthe ridge was formed or why it is confined to the equator. The cause of thismoon’s unusual inclined orbital plane is also unknown.Richard C. Hoagland, a former consultant to NASA and science adviser to WalterCronkite and CBS News, stated that “ ‘the Great Wall of Iapetus’ now forcesserious reconsideration of a range of staggering possibilities that some willmost certainly find … upsetting: That, it could really be a ‘wall’ … a vast,planet spanning, artificial construct!!” (emphasis in the original). Hoaglandwent so far as to speculate that the entire moon might be an artificialnine-hundred-mile-wide “spacecraft.”Hoagland does not stand alone in this assessment. Tobias Owen and DonaldGoldsmith, authors of The Search for Life in the Universe, wrote, “This unusualmoon is the only object in the solar system which we might seriously regard asan alien signpost—a natural object deliberately modified by an advancedcivilization to attract our attention. …”Could the clues to Iapetus’s purpose in the solar system be hidden in themythology surrounding its name? In Greek mythology, Iapetus was the Titan son ofUranus, who was the god of the heavens and who was married to Gaia, mother ofthe Earth. Iapetus was the father of Atlas, a Titan who held up the Earth, andPrometheus, a god who brought knowledge in the form of fire and light tohumankind. Robert Graves, British mythologist and author of I, Claudius, citedold Jewish traditions that equated the name Iapetus (Iapetós in Greek) withJapheth, a son of Noah. These Greek gods were all considered progenitors of thehuman race, and they fit quite neatly into the Sumerian accounts ofextraterrestrial visitors creating a worker race. Only the names change throughsucceeding languages and cultures.MOON ANOMALIES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s05]Even our own moon, long the object of both human fear and reverence, continuesto be enmeshed in controversies. Lights, moving shadows, unexplained structures,and even the moon’s unnatural orbit might be explained by intelligent design,but such an idea would exclude this being done by human beings from Earth, atleast those in our recorded history.After six moon landings between 1969 and 1972 and the return of some 842 poundsof rocks and soil samples plus the placement of five nuclear-powered scientificstations on the lunar surface, there still have been no clear-cut answers to themoon’s mysteries.The moon is far older than previously imagined, perhaps even much older than theEarth and sun. By examining tracks burned into moon rocks by cosmic rays,scientists have dated them to 5.3 billion years ago, making them almost abillion years older than our planet. This puzzle was compounded by the fact thatthe lunar dust in which the rocks were found proved to be a billion years olderthan the rocks themselves, indicating that it may have come from somewhere else,perhaps as a result of traveling through space. The heavier moon rocks are foundon the surface and do not match the surrounding soil.The moon is extremely dry and does not appear to have ever had water in anysubstantial amounts, as none of the moon rocks, regardless of location found,contained free water or even water molecules bound into the minerals. Yetinstruments left behind by Apollo missions sent a signal to Earth on March 7,1971, indicating that a “wind” of water had crossed the moon’s surface andlasted for fourteen hours. Although NASA officials attempted to explain thiscloud of water as water vapor escaping from tanks on two separate Apollo descentstages, many declined to accept this theory, pointing out that the twotanks—from Apollo 12 and 14—were some 108 miles apart, yet the water vapor wasdetected at the same flow rate at both sites, although the instruments faced inopposite directions.The presence of maria, or large seas of smooth solidified molten rock, on themoon indicates nothing less than a vast outpouring of lava at some distant time.It has now been confirmed that some of the moon’s craters are of internalorigin. In comparison to the rest of the moon, the maria are relatively free ofcraters, suggesting that craters were covered by lava flow. Yet scientists havefound no evidence of volcanic activity on the moon. Some have associated thislava flow with mascons, large dense circular masses that lie twenty to fortymiles below the center of the moon’s maria. They were discovered because theirdenseness distorted the orbits of spacecraft flying over or near them. Onescientist proposed that the mascons are heavy iron meteorites that plunged deepinto the moon while it was in a soft, formable stage. This theory has beendiscounted because meteorites strike with such high velocities that they wouldvaporize on contact. Another mundane explanation is that the mascons are nothingmore than lava-filled caverns, but skeptics say there isn’t enough lava present,nor is lava dense enough, to accomplish this. “What they are is a major moonmystery,” wrote author Don Wilson. “It now appears that the mascons are broaddisk-shaped objects that could be possibly some kind of artificial construction.For huge circular disks are not likely to be beneath each huge maria, centeredlike bull-eyes in the middle of each, by coincidence or accident.”Almost three thousand seismic disturbances termed moonquakes were recordedbetween 1969 and 1977 after Apollo missions placed seismographic equipment atsix separate sites on the moon. Most of the vibrations were quite small andperhaps were caused by meteorite strikes or falling booster rockets. But manyother quakes were detected deep inside the moon. This internal creaking isbelieved to be caused by rocks settling due to the gravitational pull of ourplanet, as most moonquakes occur when the moon is closest to Earth. But inNovember 1958, Soviet astronomer Nikolai A. Kozyrev of the Crimean AstrophysicalObservatory photographed the first recorded gaseous eruption on the moon. Heattributed this to escaping fluorescent gases. Some scientists refused to acceptKozyrev’s findings until astronomers at the Lowell Observatory also saw reddishglows on the crests of ridges in the Aristarchus region in 1963. Days latercolored lights lasting more than an hour were reported at two separateobservatories. Something was going on inside the volcanically dead moon.Perhaps strangest of all the anomalies are the many indications that the moonmay be hollow. Studies of moon rocks indicate that the moon’s interior differsfrom the Earth’s mantle in ways suggesting a very small core or none at all. A1962 study found the interior of the moon to be less dense than the exterior.“Indeed, it would seem that the moon is more like a hollow than a homogeneoussphere,” concluded NASA scientist Gordon MacDonald.MIT’s Sean C. Solomon noted, “The Lunar Orbiter experiments vastly improved ourknowledge of the moon’s gravitational field … indicating the frighteningpossibility that the moon might be hollow.”The most startling evidence that the moon could be hollow came on November 20,1969, when the Apollo 12 crew, after returning to their command ship, sent thelunar module (LM) ascent stage crashing back onto the moon, creating anartificial moonquake. The LM struck the surface about forty miles from theApollo 12 landing site, where ultrasensitive seismic equipment recordedsomething both unexpected and astounding—the moon reverberated like a bell formore than an hour. Frank Press of MIT stated, “ … none of us have seen anythinglike this on Earth. In all our experience, it is quite an extraordinary event.That this rather small impact … produced a signal which lasted 30 minutes isquite beyond the range of our experience.”Undoubtedly the greatest mystery concerning our moon is how it came to be therein the first place. Prior to the Apollo missions, one serious theory as to themoon’s origin was that it broke away from Earth eons ago. This idea wasdiscarded when it was found that there is little similarity between thecomposition of our world and the moon. A more recent theory had the moon createdout of space debris left over from the creation of Earth. This concept proveduntenable in light of current gravitational theory, which predicts that onelarge object will accumulate all loose material, leaving none for the formationof another large body. Mainstream science now accepts the theory that the moonoriginated elsewhere and entered the Earth’s gravitational field at some pointin ancient times. But how the body came to orbit our planet is the subject oftwo theories: one states that the moon was formed from debris after a spaceobject smashed into Earth, while the second states that the Earth captured themoon in its gravitational field while it was wandering through the solar system.Neither of these theories is especially compelling because of the lack ofevidence that either Earth or Luna has been physically disrupted by a past closeencounter. There is no debris in space indicating a past collision, and it doesnot appear that the Earth and the moon developed during the same time period. Asfor the capture theory, even scientist Isaac Asimov wrote, “It’s too big to havebeen captured by the Earth. The chances of such a capture having been effectedand the moon then having taken up nearly circular orbit around our Earth are toosmall to make such an eventuality credible.”Asimov was right to consider the moon’s orbit: not only is it nearly a perfectcircle, but the moon’s rotation is synchronized with its period of revolution,so one side always faces Earth, with only the slightest variation. This circularorbit is especially odd, considering that the moon’s center of mass lies morethan a mile closer to the Earth than its geometric center. This fact aloneshould produce an unstable, wobbly orbit, much as a ball with its massoff-center will not roll in a straight line.THE BIG WHACK [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s06]In the late 1960s, the Planetary Science Institute’s senior scientist, WilliamKenneth Hartmann, conjectured that the moon’s creation resulted from a collisionbetween Earth and another body at least as large as Mars. By 2000, computermodels seemed to bring further support to what became known as the Big Whacktheory. If this theory sounds familiar, it should—it’s basically the story toldin the ancient Sumerian tablets.The Big Whack did not adequately explain why such an impact did not increase theEarth’s orbital speed, so it was suggested that a second collision occurred byan object coming from the opposite direction and thus canceling out theincreased spin celestial mechanics demanded by the first strike. Researcherstheorized that the second orb striking the Earth must have been a giant—at leastthree times the size of Mars. This, of course, lends scientific support to thestory of Nibiru’s large moon Kingu striking the watery world called Tiamat, asrecounted in the ancient Sumerian tablets.The Big Whack theory has been tentatively accepted by conventional science forthe simple reason that it seems to be the least impossible explanation currentlyavailable, yet it still does not explain how our moon ended up exactly onefour-hundredth the size of the sun and in an orbit exactly one four-hundredththe distance between the sun and Earth while traveling at just the correctorbital speed to maintain that distance.As science writer William Roy Shelton wrote, “It is important to remember thatsomething had to put the moon at or near its present circular pattern around theEarth. Just as an Apollo spacecraft circling the Earth every 90 minutes while100 miles high has to have a velocity of roughly 18,000 miles per hour to stayin orbit, so something had to give the moon the precisely required velocity forits weight and altitude. … The point—and it is one seldom noted in consideringthe origin of the moon—is that it is extremely unlikely that any object wouldjust stumble into the right combination of factors required to stay in orbit.`Something’ had to put the moon at its altitude, on its course and at its speed.The question is: what was that ‘something’?”If the precise and stationary orbit of the moon is seen as sheer coincidence, isit also coincidence that the moon is at just the right distance from Earth tocompletely cover the sun during an eclipse? While the diameter of the moon is amere 2,160 miles against the sun’s gigantic 864,000 miles, it is nevertheless injust the proper position to block out all but the sun’s flaming corona when itmoves between the sun and Earth. Asimov explains, “There is no astronomicalreason why the moon and the sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest ofcoincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in thisfashion.”SPACESHIP MOON? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s07]The idea of coincidence being involved in the configuration of the Earth, moon,and sun pales at the odds involved, but the concept of intelligent design raisesmore questions than answers. In July 1970, two Russian scientists offered abizarre theory of the origin of the moon—but one that provided an answer to allthe mysteries. Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov published an article inthe Soviet journal Sputnik entitled “Is the Moon the Creation of AlienIntelligence?”The Russians advanced the theory that the moon is not a completely naturalworld, but a planetoid that was hollowed out eons ago in the far reaches ofspace by intelligent beings possessing a technology far superior to ours. Hugemachines were used to melt rock and form large cavities within the moon (themascons?), spewing the molten refuse onto the surface (the maria?). Protected bya hull-like inner shell plus a reconstructed outer shell of metallic rocky junk,this gigantic craft was steered through the cosmos and finally parked in orbitaround Earth. This ship could be compared to the Death Star in the Star Warsfilms. “Many things so far considered to be lunar enigmas are explainable in thelight of this new hypothesis,” they wrote. In fact, supporters of thespaceship-moon theory believe that the moon may be a hollowed-out asteroid onceused to transport the space travelers mentioned in the ancient Sumerian tablets.In fact, the spaceship-moon theory may come closer than any other in reconcilingthe contradictions inherent in the origin and amazing orbit of the moon.However, such a consideration is supposed to be outside the discussion ofeducated and rational people. The circular logic of conventional scienceregarding the origins of the moon runs something like this: We know thatextraterrestrials don’t exist, but we do know that the moon exists and has beenmentioned throughout human history. We humans did not create it nor place it inorbit around Earth, so it must have been done by extraterrestrials. But becausewe know they don’t exist, we will simply call it an anomaly and will notpublicly say any more about it.NONHUMANS ON THE MOON [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s08]The evidence of life on Mars and speculation concerning a lunar spaceship hasraised the question whether someone may still be residing on the moon. Suchthinking stems from the numerous reports of activity and structures seen on themoon during the past decade. Actually, the accounts of lights seen moving abouton the moon go back centuries.On July 29, 1953, New York Herald Tribune science editor John J. O’Neill claimedto have seen a twelve-mile-long “bridge” straddling the Mare Crisium crater. Amonth later, the structure was confirmed by British astronomer H. P. Wilkens,who told the BBC, “It looks artificial. It’s almost incredible that such a thingcould have been formed in the first instance, or if it was formed, could havelasted during the ages in which the moon has been in existence.” Sometime laterthis bridge was no longer observed.Another most amazing structure is known as the Shard. Located in the Ukert areaof the moon, which is at the point nearest Earth, the Shard was photographed byOrbiter 3 in preparation for the Apollo missions. This odd monument towers amile and a half from the moon’s surface. Bruce Cornet, an independent geologistwho has studied photos of the Shard at length, said, “No known natural processcan explain such a structure.”Perhaps even more amazing is a huge upright structure in the Sinus Medii regiondubbed the Tower. Cornet said, “The Tower represents an enigma of the highestmagnitude, because it rises more than five miles above the surface of the moon,and has been photographed from five different angles and two differentaltitudes. In all four photographs the same structure is visible and can beviewed from two different sides. The Tower exists in front of and to the left ofthe Shard in the Lunar Orbiter III-84M photograph. The top of the Tower has avery cubic geometry and appears to be composed of regular cubes joined togetherto form a very large cube with an estimated width of over one mile!”In November 1966, Lunar Orbiter 2 took photos from twenty-nine miles above theSea of Tranquility in the Moon’s northeastern quadrant, showing what appear tobe several slender pyramids or obelisks similar to Central Park’s Cleopatra’sNeedle, some as high as a fifteen-story building. Predictably, NASA denied thatthat Orbiter photos disclosed anything unusual on the moon, even as theyreleased the pictures. Because there was no official confirmation, most newsoutlets did not cover the story. However, the Washington Post carried the storyon the front page with the headline, “Six Mysterious Statuesque ShadowsPhotographed on the Moon by Orbiter.” In this article, staff writer ThomasO’Toole wrote that scientists had no idea what was casting the tall shadows butthat the “largest shadow is just the sort that would be cast by somethingresembling the Washington Monument.”Russian space engineer Alexander Abramov added to the mystery by stating, “Thedistribution of these lunar objects is similar to the plan of the Egyptianpyramids constructed by Pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Menkaura at Gizeh, nearCairo. The centers of the spires in this lunar ‘abaka’ are arranged in preciselythe same way as the apices of the three great pyramids.”If these structures are pyramids and if they do match the layout of the Egyptianpyramids, they might connect to the pyramid-shaped structures photographed by aViking probe of Mars in 1976. Objects that appear to be pyramids, along with thecontroversial “face on Mars” were seen in photos taken of the Cydonia area. Someresearchers have wondered if these monuments might represent some grand design.“It is the eerie similarity between the pyramidal structures that have come tostand for ‘Egypt’ and those lying—empty and abandoned—at Cydonia, that almostscream of some ‘connection,’ ” wrote former NASA consultant Hoagland, who hasadvanced the theory of artificial structures on both Mars and the moon.Hoagland suggested that perhaps the Apollo missions had an unstated agenda ofseeking the truth of these anomalies. He and other suspicious-minded UFOresearchers have publicly wondered if the destinations of some of the Apollomoon missions—such as the Sea of Tranquility for Apollo 11 and theTaurus-Littrow area for Apollo 17—were selected because of the high incidence ofabnormal sightings in those locations. If they were, nobody in NASA officiallyis talking about it.Private researcher and author George H. Leonard came to a startling conclusionregarding activity and structures on the moon. In 1977, after years of“haunting” NASA photo files, Leonard claimed to have found enough evidence toconvince him that “the moon is occupied by an intelligent race or races whichprobably moved in from outside the solar system.” He added, “The moon is firmlyin the possession of these occupants. Evidence of their presence is everywhere:on the surface, on the near side and the hidden side, in the craters, on themaria, and in the highlands. They are changing its face. Suspicion orrecognition of that triggered the U.S. and Soviet moon programs—which may notreally be so much a race as a desperate cooperation.”Leonard in 1977 wrote Somebody Else Is on the Moon, in which he discussed morethan two dozen NASA photos. While many of these photos were indistinct to theuntrained eye and might have shown almost anything, some were indeed curious.Some seem to show “bridges” across lunar chasms similar to the one reported inthe New York Herald Tribune, “stitching” with some sort of material connectingsurface splits, domed-shaped objects in the center of lit craters, and lengthy“tracks” in the moon dust. “The professionals choose to ignore these signs. Theydo not fit into the orthodoxy,” wrote Leonard, adding that an unnamed NASAscientist confided to him that “discoveries” had been made but not announced tothe public.After studying hundreds of lunar photos, Leonard concluded that whoever is onthe moon is doing at least two things: mining for minerals, or perhaps water andoxygen, and repairing damage to the moon’s surface. Leonard was not alone in hisbeliefs. Some researchers claim that moon photos show a series of transparentdomes under which can be seen orderly lines indicating the possible ruins ofcities or large stations. Ingo Swann, who helped develop the U.S. Army’sremote-viewing techniques, has stated that he psychically viewed humanlikefigures working on the surface of the moon.Since man has made such a tremendouseffort to send astronauts to the moon—thought by most to be a lifelessworld—someone might have made a similar effort to send their astronauts toEarth. This could have taken place in man’s dim early history, leaving behindonly tantalizing evidence leading to the present widespread belief in ancientastronauts.LOST PROBES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s09]It should be noted that past attempts to make a close-up study of both Mars andparticularly Phobos have been disastrous. The unmanned Russian probe Phobos Iwas lost en route to Mars, reportedly due to a command communication failure.Phobos II disappeared in March 1989 as it approached orbit around Mars;communication was lost as the craft passed into the vicinity of Phobos. TheSoviets suggested that it had spun out of control due to an erroneous groundcommand.In mid-1991, six former U.S. Army remote viewers were commissioned by officialswithin the Russian space program to study the cause of Phobos II’sdisappearance. Remote viewing is the term given to a controlled psychic abilitythat allows one to perceive persons, places, and things at a distance withoutthe use of the normal five senses. Such techniques were studied by both academicand government scientists before the creation of a remote-viewing unit withinthe U.S. Army’s Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) in the early 1970s.On September 29, 1991, the remote viewers issued a final report, entitled“Enigma Penetration: Soviet Phobos II Space Craft Images Anomaly.” The reportstated that a disc-shaped object rose from the Martian surface toward Phobos IIwhile a second object moved into even closer proximity and scanned the probewith a penetrating particle beam device, which disrupted the communication andguidance equipment. The out-of-control Soviet craft was then struck by a“micrometeorite” that delivered the coup de grâce. The remote viewers said thismay have been no accident, as it seems that all of the technology put into spacefrom Earth is scrutinized closely by nonhumans. If it would reveal alienactivities, then it is decommissioned. After being struck, Phobos II spiraleddown, crashing onto the Martian surface.Amazing as this account appears, there was supporting feedback from the Sovietsthemselves. It first came from Alexander Dunayev, chairman of the Soviet spaceorganization responsible for the Phobos II project. Dunayev announced that thedoomed probe had photographed the image of a small odd-shaped object betweenitself and Mars. He speculated that the object might have been “debris in theorbit of Phobos” or even jettisoned parts from the spacecraft. His tone wasanything but certain.More astounding feedback came in December 1991, when Soviet cosmonauts visitedthe United States. Retired Soviet Air Force colonel and cosmonaut trainee MarinaPopovich displayed to newsmen in San Francisco one of the last photographsreceived from the Phobos II. The photo showed the silhouette of an odd-shapedobject approaching the spacecraft. Popovich said the picture was taken on March25, 1989, in deep space near Phobos shortly before contact with the craft waslost. She said the object very well may have been an alien spacecraft.The photographed object bore an uncanny resemblance to the object drawn insketches by the remote viewers. If their account of the demise of Phobos II iscorrect, then serious attention must be given their statement that the same fatebefell the Mars Observer.The Mars Observer, launched by the United States, vanished on August 20, 1993,just as it was about to go into orbit around Mars. Both scientists and laymenhad high hopes that the Mars Observer would transmit photographs back to Earthwhich might solve some of the Martian mysteries—such as the human “face on Mars”and the three symmetrical pyramids seen in NASA photographs.The 5,672-pound Mars Observer spent eleven months traveling to our neighboringplanet and was scheduled to go into orbit around Mars on August 24. NASAofficials initially theorized that the probe’s timing clock malfunctioned,making the onboard computer unable to process commands being radioed from theJet Propulsion Lab. But as days passed and communication was never resumed withthe craft, hopes dimmed of ever knowing precisely what happened to it.The military-trained remote viewers, however, said they saw Mars Observermeeting the same fate as Phobos II as well as another, secret space launch thatsame month in 1993. They noted the similarity of fates between the Phobosmissions and Mars Observer.This pattern may have continued in another failed Russian attempt to probe thesecrets of Phobos. In the fall of 2011, control over Phobos Grunt (literally,Phobos Soil) was lost, and fears grew that its ten-ton load of toxic fuel andoxidizer might wreak havoc when the failed craft reentered Earth’s atmosphere.The stricken craft reportedly crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Sunday, January15, 2012, with no reported consequences. Why would all these probes be failing?Could it be that something on Mars doesn’t want us observing the planet? Onething seems clear—someone or something continues to operate far outside Earth."},{"pageContent":"HUMANKIND: THE ANOMALIES CONTINUE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha03]BEFORE TAKING UP THE CONCEPT OF ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS, ONE must consider theorigins of humankind. What is conventional science holding back regarding thebeginnings of our species, and what might this mean to our future?DARWINISM UNDER FIRE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s11]The squabble over how the world was created or whether some moons are artificialappears puny compared to the ongoing fight over the origins of humankind. Thefocus of this argument centers around the English naturalist Charles Darwin’stheories in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. In this work, Darwinproposed a simple explanation for life on Earth—that life evolved through aseries of biological changes deriving from random genetic mutations inconjunction with a process known as natural selection. This supposes that thosespecies best adapted to environmental change are best suited to survive.Although Darwin never explicitly stated that man descended from the ape, hisdevotees advocated that conclusion, drawing criticism from religiousfundamentalists. The idea of survival of the fittest is perhaps the best knownof Darwin’s principles and has been taught in schools for several generations.The evolution account is familiar—fish evolved into amphibians, which changedinto reptiles, which became birds and mammals, which eventually evolved intohumans. “However, it is far easier to explain this to schoolchildren—with cuteillustrations and pictures of a lineup of apes (beginning with those havingslumped shoulders, transitioning to those that are standing upright)—than it isto prove,” cautioned Will Hart, author of The Genesis Race. In fact, Darwin’stheory continues to generate controversy because, as Hart pointed out, it “isthe only scientific theory taught worldwide that has yet to be proved by therigorous standards of science.”Even after a hundred years of effort, no one has been able to fully substantiateDarwin’s theories through documented fossil exhibits. Yet Darwin’s theory ofevolution continues to be taught in most schools and continues to generatecontroversy. The late Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould noted, “Allpaleontologists know that the fossil record contains precious little in the wayof intermediate forms; transitions between major groups [of species] arecharacteristically lacking.”Darwin never actually insisted that man descended from the ape. This was aconclusion of his followers. Darwin himself admitted to giant holes in his owntheory. “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which couldnot possibly have been formed by numerous, successive slight modifications, mytheory would absolutely break down,” he wrote in On the Origin of Species.No such indisputable linkage to complex organs has yet been found, and somerespected scientists use this as evidence against the theory of human evolution.Lehigh University biochemistry professor Michael Behe, after studiouslyresearching blood clotting, cilia, the human immune system, transfer ofmaterials between cells, and nucleotides, concluded that these aspects of humanphysiology are too “irreducibly complex” to have evolved from “less complete”predecessors through natural selection. Proponents of the intelligent-designtheory of life seized upon Behe’s work as justification for their beliefs.In 2005, Behe presented his theory of “irreducible complexity” in a Pennsylvaniacourt case challenging a school district mandate that a statement aboutintelligent design be included with evolution in science classes. U.S. DistrictCourt Judge John E. Jones III, a conservative Republican appointed in 2002 byPresident George W. Bush, ruled that the required statement was unconstitutionalbecause Professor Behe’s claim was not science but a form of creationism, areligious belief that had been “rejected by the scientific community at large.”HUMAN CHRONOLOGY REVISED [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s12]Although Behe’s ideas were rejected by the court, could he have been on tosomething about human development and the way it fits in with the theory ofevolution? After all, we have every reason to doubt the timeline of ourdevelopment, as it continually is being revised. For example, fishhooks andfishbones dating back 42,000 years were discovered in a limestone cave in EastTimor in early 2012. This finding indicated that humans were capable of skilled,deep-sea fishing 30,000 years earlier than previously thought. One of thediscoverers, Sue O’Connor of the Australian National University’s Department ofArchaeology and Natural History, told the media, “There was never any hint of[what] maritime technology people might have had in terms of fishing gear 42,000years ago.”Alan Butler and Christopher Knight, best-selling authors of the alternativehistory Civilization One, have pointed to further evidence that the human racedeveloped far earlier than believed. Butler and Knight described a large-scalegene-mapping program by researchers at deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, Iceland,which found that it was possible to date the origin of a genetic differenceamong nearly thirty thousand Icelandic women. This was accomplished by countingthe number of DNA differences from normal DNA. This study indicated that thedifferences began about three million years ago, long before modern humans werethought to have evolved.The study of DNA also supports the idea that genetic connections can be found ina wide diversity of the human population, indicating widespread early migrationand genetic mingling. Author Gavin Menzies found support for such far-flungtravel in an unexpected place. In the study of human DNA, mitochondrial DNAcarries a rare genetic marker, or haplogroup, called haplogroup X. Even rarer ishaplogroup X2, which has been found in the Caucasus Mountain region, theMediterranean, and, surprisingly, among the Ojibwa Native Americans livingprimarily around Lake Superior.Analyzing blood gave credence to the idea of an island in the mid-Atlantic. Inhis 1978 book, Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space, aerospace engineer MauriceChatelain, who helped conceive and design the Apollo spacecraft that journeyedto the moon, reported that five Incan mummies in the British Museum contained ablood type unlike that of their American neighbors but identical to the Basquepopulation found on the Atlantic coasts of Spain and France. One even had an Rhfactor not found elsewhere on Earth. Unfortunately, this intriguing study,conducted by a British scientist in 1952, cannot now be duplicated, as themummies were destroyed when a water pipe burst in the basement of the BritishMuseum. It is unclear if this was sheer accident. Chatelain also noted that themummification processes of the Mayans and the Incas were the same as those ofthe Egyptians and Sumerians.Fossilized bones found in China have been carbon-dated to more than 11,500 yearsago and indicate that a previously unknown type of humanoid was living at thesame time as modern humans. Termed the Red Deer Cave people because of thenow-extinct red deer they cooked and ate, these fossils exhibit an unusualmixture of features both from modern humans and something else. Stone artifactsfound at the site also suggest they were toolmakers.The Red Deer Cave people fossils exhibited long, broad, and tall frontal lobeslike modern humans. But they differed from modern Homo sapiens in havingprominent brow ridges, thick skull bones, flat upper faces with a broad nose,jutting jaws lacking a humanlike chin, brains moderate in size by ice-age humanstandards, large molars, and primitively short parietal lobes, brain lobes atthe top of the head associated with sensory data. “These are primitive featuresseen in our ancestors hundreds of thousands of years ago,” commented DarrenCurnoe, a paleoanthropologist with the University of New South Wales inAustralia. Scientists said the mixture of features made them difficult toclassify either as a new species or an unusual type of modern human. “In short,they’re anatomically unique among all members of the human evolutionary tree,”said Curnoe.In 2010, archaeologists found evidence in the Buttermilk Creek complex fortymiles northwest of Austin, Texas, that proved humans were in the Americas asearly as 15,500 years ago—around 1,500 years earlier than previously believed.“This is the oldest credible archaeological site in North America,” said teamleader Michael R. Waters, director of the Center for the Study of the FirstAmericans at Texas A&M University.The squabble over Darwinism is not confined to religious fundamentalists.However, any mainstream scientists and academics who challenge evolutionorthodoxy are often excluded from the debate and even find themselvesunemployed, a grim reminder of the unforgiving nature of the status quo.MAVERICK SCIENTISTS QUELLED [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s13]There is even controversy concerning the Ice Age, the most recent (Pleistocene)glaciation, an event recently popularized by three 20th Century Fox animatedfilms. Author and computer scientist Kurt Johmann has noted that theconventional concept of the Ice Age is that a layer of ice up to two miles thickin places extended all the way from the North Pole down to where London and NewYork are located today and peaked about twenty thousand years ago. So much waterwas locked up as ice that the sea level worldwide was about 450 feet lower thanit is now, and this lowering opened up land bridges, which made it possible forprehistoric humans to spread around the world.“One may call these three beliefs—the alleged giant ice sheets, the allegedgreatly lowered sea level, and the alleged Bering Strait land-bridge by whichthe Indians came—the holy trinity of the Ice Age,” Johmann wrote. “For theaverage educated American the truthfulness of this holy trinity goesunquestioned. After all, not only is one brainwashed with it in school, but thatbrainwashing is reinforced by the many books and magazines, and TV shows(including both fiction shows such as movies, and so-called science shows), thattake the reality of the Ice Age for granted.“Up until my recent reading of the book Cataclysm! [by D. S. Allan and J. B.Delair], I had assumed there were ice sheets, just as the Ice Age belief systemteaches, and just as I had been brainwashed to believe. However, the authors ofCataclysm! say that the imagined ice sheets are a fiction, because the driftdeposits and scratch marks, which constitute the primary physical evidence forthe ice sheets, are better explained as the result of moving water (in effect, agreat flood), rather than moving ice.”Johmann suggested that the idea of moving ice was chosen over moving waterbecause a great flood meant catastrophism, while moving ice sheets meansgradualism. “The doctrine of gradualism better served the interests of theestablishment than catastrophism,” he wrote. Likewise, the idea of a “missinglink” between primates and modern man also has created a number of problems formodern science, which suggest that our entire understanding of the timing andorigins of the human race could be flawed. Could conventional science be hidinga stranger truth to the story of the human race?In their popular 1993 book, Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of theHuman Race, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson argued that the scientificcommunity could be suppressing shocking evidence. Both Cremo, a U.S. Navyveteran who attended George Washington University, and Thompson, who received aPhD in mathematics from Cornell University in 1974, became involved in the topicof creationism from the perspective of Hindu Vedic writings. Based on the studyof these ancient works coupled with a multitude of archaeological anomaliesfound worldwide in the past two centuries, they concluded humans have existed onEarth for millions, perhaps billions, of years. But they claimed such evidencehas been suppressed. Needless to say, traditionalists have called their workpseudoscience based on specimens and artifacts that no longer can be produced.However, such scientific arrogance was also noted by scientists Giorgio deSantillana and Hertha von Dechend. In the introduction to their 1969 seminalwork, Hamlet’s Mill, they commented that “the experts now are benighted by thecurrent folk fantasy, which is the belief that they are beyond all this—criticswithout nonsense and extremely wise.”Cremo and Thompson provided an example of scientific suppression of evidence,recounting the discovery of sophisticated stone tools at Hueyatlaco,seventy-five miles southeast of Mexico City, in the 1960s. The tools rivaled thebest work of Cro-Magnon man in Europe. More tools were found at the nearby siteof El Horno. Both sets of tools seem to undoubtedly have come from layers ofrock that are the same age. But what made the tools controversial was theirage—they were dated to about 250,000 years ago.A U.S. Geological Survey team headed by archaeologist Virginia Steen-McIntyrehad established this age through the use of four separate dating methods,including uranium series dating, fission track dating, tephra hydration dating,and the study of mineral weathering, and their findings were confirmed bymultiple peer-reviewed studies. If the dating had been accepted, “it would haverevolutionized not only New World anthropology but the whole picture of humanorigins,” Cremo and Thompson noted. “Human beings capable of making thesophisticated tools found at Hueyatlaco are not thought to have come intoexistence until about 100,000 years ago in Africa.”Steen-McIntyre was both blocked and ridiculed when she tried to get her team’sconclusions published. In a note written in 1976, she stated, “I had found outthrough back fence gossip that [team members] Hal, Roald, and I are consideredopportunists and publicity seekers in some circles, because of Hueyatlaco, and Iam still smarting from the blow.” She also soon found that she could not findmore work in her chosen profession.Writing to one editor of a scientific publication, H. J. Fullbright of the LosAlamos Scientific Laboratory, Steen-McIntyre argued her case thusly: “Our jointarticle on the Hueyatlaco site is a real bombshell. It would place man in theNew World 10 times earlier than many archaeologists would like to believe.Worse, the bifacial tools that were found in situ are thought by most to be asign of H[omo] sapiens. According to present theory, H.s. had not even evolvedat that time, and certainly not in the New World.“Archaeologists are in a considerable uproar over Hueyatlaco. They refuse evento consider it. I’ve learned from second-hand sources that I’m considered byvarious members of the profession to be 1) incompetent; 2) a news monger; 3) anopportunist; 4) dishonest; 5) a fool. Obviously, none of these opinions ishelping my professional reputation! My only hope to clear my name is to get theHueyatlaco article into print so that folks can judge the evidence forthemselves.” Steen-McIntyre received no reply. Her article was not published,nor was it even returned to her.Although her group was finally able to present a paper at an anthropologicalconference in 1975, it was not until 1981 that a paper on Hueyatlaco waspublished in the scientific journal Quaternary Research (Number 16, pp. 1–17).Sometime later, Steen-McIntyre offered her article to another scientificpublication but warned that if the findings were accepted, all anthropologytextbooks would require rewriting. The editor responded by stating that while hewould consider her article for publication, he believed it would be difficult toobtain objective reviews from most archaeologists. The editor’s reasoning wascircular: because everyone knew that Homo sapiens evolved in Eurasia between30,000 and 50,000 years ago, any tools or artifacts dated to 250,000 years agowere impossible, since everyone knew that humans evolved in Eurasia 30,000 to50,000 years ago.Cremo and Thompson commented on Virginia Steen-McIntyre’s case, writing that it“opens a rare window into the actual social processes of data suppression inpaleoanthropology, processes that involve a great deal of conflict and hurt.”Even Cremo and Thompson faced hardship due to their involvement in the case. “Weourselves once tried to secure permission to reproduce photographs of theHueyatlaco artifacts in a publication,” they wrote. “We were informed thatpermission would be denied if we intended to mention the lunatic fringe date of250,000 years.”In a 1997 interview intended for Harper’s magazine but only published later inthe Midwestern Epigraphic Journal, Steen-McIntyre was asked why respectablescientists and even governments would resist anything at odds with the currentscientific worldview. “Because it’s interwoven with the Theory of Evolution:accept one, you have to accept the other,” she responded, adding that Darwin’stheory is just a theory and “a shaky one at that.”Steen-McIntyre added, “When the Theory of Evolution is taken to its logicalconclusion, the only moral imperative demanded is ‘survival of the fittest.’ Idon’t like it, for scientific reasons: it goes against the Second Law ofThermodynamics for one thing. I don’t like it for philosophical and religiousreasons. I especially don’t like it because it helped ruin my career. … Thearchaeologist in charge of the Hueyatlaco dig rejected our geologic dates of aquarter-million years because, according to her belief, modern man, the maker ofthose tools, had not yet evolved 250,000 years ago. … A classic case of arguingfrom theory to data, then tossing out the data that don’t fit.”Steen-McIntyre believed that her data was rejected by a superior due to “amatter of influence on her part and lack of it on mine. She was ananthropologist, a graduate of Radcliffe and Harvard with powerful friends; I wasa geologist with a new PhD from the University of Idaho, looking for a job.”That superior was Cynthia Irwin-Williams, who led the initial digs atHueyatlaco. Though she had argued with Steen-McIntyre and called her“irresponsible,” she has never published a final report on the findings.SUPPRESSION BY THE SMITHSONIAN [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s14]The suppression of the geologists’ data from Mexico may be an unfortunateexample of dogma getting in the way of discovery, but what happens when suchdiscoveries are hijacked? Researcher and historian Martin Doutré related aconversation he had with a former National Park Service employee about anincident that took place at Arizona’s Canyon de Chelly National Monument in1999. “A big washout had occurred in the canyon after torrential rains, and anumber of skeletons were exposed at a few sites. All of the Park Servicepersonnel were pressed into service to gather up and box up the newly revealedbones. However, in a somewhat sinister twist, all of the work was overseen bypersonnel from both the Smithsonian Institution and the FBI. The Parks Serviceworkers were forbidden to bring cameras to the site and were subjected to fullbody searches by the FBI when arriving in the morning or leaving at night. Allof the skeletal remains and artifacts were carefully boxed up and taken away bythe Smithsonian Institute. The Park’s Service workers were forced to signsecrecy agreements of non-disclosure of information related to their activitiesin the canyon.”In a follow-up e-mail, the former Park Service employee offered further detailsof the find. She said in one grave was a “male, approximately seven-foot inheight, [with] six fingers and six toes … the teeth were like human, except theyhad no canine (eye) teeth, and [had] extra-large molars and incisors. The skullwas large—heavy jaw [with a] long, large cranium. Large eye sockets. Fingerbones [were] extra-long, but small hands. Buried with beautiful pottery andbaskets of fine weave—never seen anything similar. A necklace of fiber andfeathers. He looked rather fresh for 6,000 years old, as the Smith [Smithsonian]people claimed. Clean bones- but not brittle … ” Her description is especiallyinteresting in light of a biblical passage, II Samuel 21:18–22, telling ofgiants related to Goliath with six fingers and toes.Some believe the Smithsonian has a huge underground warehouse in New York City,filled with thousands of skeletons, objects, and information that might proveembarrassing to conventional history.“It’s appalling that the American people are so blatantly denied access to veryimportant archaeological evidence, which would quickly clarify mysteries relatedto long-term regional history,” said Doutré. “Whereas North American archaeologyhas been stagnated or has gone backwards for 130 years, all of the essentialevidence is in the hands of the authorities to rectify that abysmal situation,but is kept permanently under wraps and beyond the reach of thesocially-engineered American public.”The late Vine Deloria, an activist historian and author of the 1969 book CusterDied for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto, also charged the Smithsonian withsuppression of valuable historical information. “It’s probably better that sofew of the ruins and remains were tied in with the Smithsonian because they givegood reason to believe the ending of the Indiana Jones movie—a great warehousewhere the real secrets of earth history are buried,” he wrote. “Modern dayarchaeology and anthropology have nearly sealed the door on our imaginations,broadly interpreting the North American past as devoid of anything unusual inthe way of great cultures characterized by a people of unusual demeanor. Thegreat interloper of ancient burial grounds, the nineteenth century SmithsonianInstitution, created a one-way portal, through which uncounted bones have beenspirited. This door and the contents of its vault are virtually sealed off toanyone but government officials. Among these bones may lay answers not evensought by these officials concerning the deep past.”British scientist James Smithson first founded the Smithsonian Institution andthen bequeathed it to the United States despite having never visited there.Since the U.S. Government started funding and administrating the Smithsonian in1836, the institution has been involved in several disputes over odddiscoveries. In the early 1800s, pioneers moving into the Ohio and Mississippivalleys discovered vast numbers of abandoned earthworks, generally termedmounds. The pioneers attributed these mounds to a sophisticated race oflong-vanished builders. In 1848, the new Smithsonian Institution drew attentionto the mystery of the mounds’ creation in its first published book AncientMonuments of the Mississippi Valley. The book’s authors concluded that thebuilders could not have been the ancestors of the supposedly savage NativeAmerican groups still living in those regions.According to David Hatcher Childress, an author and a world-traveling researcheron ancient cities and cultures, the contents of many ancient mounds and pyramidsof the Midwest show that an ancient and sophisticated culture once populated theMississippi River watershed. Not only had this culture been in contact withEurope and other areas, but, according to Childress, many mounds revealedburials of giants seven to eight feet tall, dressed in full armor, sometimesburied with huge treasures.This was not the only time oddly large bodies have been found or that amazingdiscoveries have been proverbially swept under the rug by the Smithsonian.Certain reports say that in the 1880s, skulls with horns protruding from themwere pulled from a burial mound at Sayre, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, by agroup of antiquarians. The odd horned skulls were part of skeletons measuringseven feet tall. It was estimated that the bodies had been buried around AD1200. According to this account, the bones were sent to the AmericanInvestigating Museum in Philadelphia, where like so many finds that questionconventional anthropology, they were stolen and never seen again.In 1924, a paleontologist discovered skeletons of red-haired giants in theLovelock Cave of Nevada, confirming Indian legends that a race of red-hairedgiants lived there about fifteen thousand years ago. According to legend, thegiants were already in the area when the first Indians arrived. These giantswere reputed to be vicious and unapproachable cannibals. During ensuing wars,the giants were decimated and finally cornered in the cave. When they refused tosurrender, the Indians filled the entrance with brush and set it afire. Thegiants who tried to escape were shot with arrows and the others suffocated inthe cave.Beginning in 1911, the cave was worked for its bat guano to be used in makinggunpowder, and most of the remains were destroyed. But an expedition in 1924 didrecover the mummified remains of two giants—a female six and a half feet talland a male more than eight feet tall. Reportedly, artifacts from the cave, butnot the mummies, may be viewed at a small natural history museum in Winnemucca,Nevada.How strongly are we to believe that races before our own were actually muchlarger than we are today, especially when supporting evidence has been wipedfrom textbooks? Another episode illustrates Smithsonian suppression ofhistorical artifacts. The late naturalist and author Ivan T. Sanderson told ofan incident during World War II on the Aleutian island of Shemya in whichengineers building an airstrip uncovered the remains of gigantic humans. Onecranium measured almost twenty-four inches from base to crown, compared to thenormal eight inches. Oddly, all the skulls showed evidence of trepanning (pokingholes in the skull with crude tools to release evil spirits). The remains werereportedly sent to the Smithsonian, which, despite the seeming importance ofsuch a find, never released any further information. Sanderson asked, “Is itthat these people cannot face rewriting all the textbooks?”The Smithsonian has been involved in several other controversies overeyebrow-raising discoveries, such as the objects found in 1944 by Germanhardware merchant Waldemar Julsrud at Acámbaro, Mexico, located about 175 milesnorthwest of Mexico City. In 1923, Waldemar was a codiscoverer of anarchaeological site first thought to be of the Tarascan culture. This discoverybrought worldwide attention after it was found to actually be a whole new Indianculture—the Chupicauro civilization, which flourished in Mexico about a thousandyears before the Tarascans.Julsrud’s 1944 find consisted of more than thirty-three thousand ceramic andstone objects, including statues and obsidian knives. The amazing aspect of thestatuary was the fact that the carvings depicted humans in association withlarge reptiles resembling dinosaurs. Along with other weird creatures, therewere representations of Sumerian and Egyptian motifs, as well as beardedCaucasians, Africans, and Polynesians.Although radiocarbon and thermoluminescence testing indicated that the objectscould be dated as far back as 6,500 years, Smithsonian officials quicklyproclaimed the entire episode a hoax. In recent years, when researcher John H.Tierney filed a Freedom of Information Act request, it was learned that all ofthe Julsrud case files at the Smithsonian were missing.Dennis Swift, on his website Dinosaursandman.com, has written of visitingAcámbaro. He noted, “Waldemar, in print [his book was published in 1947],theorized that the colossal collection of ceramic and stone artifacts had beenburied by a people who had experienced catastrophes. He conjectured that therehad been a period of catastrophes that had changed the face of the earth, andthat there must have been ancient civilizations wiped out by the catastrophes.His most radical suggestion that clashed violently with scientists was that manhad existed contemporaneously with the dinosaurs. Although there was soundevidence that Julsrud was on to something of major scientific importance, he wasridiculed by the authorities when his book was published.”In 1955, Charles Hapgood, then professor of history and anthropology at KeeneState College of the University of New Hampshire and author of Earth’s ShiftingCrust and Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, spent several months in Acámbarostudying the Julsrud collection. To eliminate the possibility the collection wasmerely a modern hoax, Hapgood located a house that had been built at the samelocation in 1930.According to Dennis Swift, “They found a house directly over the site owned bythe Chief of Police and asked permission to dig beneath the floor of his house.Permission was granted, and they dug a six-foot-deep pit beneath the hardconcrete floor of the living room, unearthing dozens of the controversialobjects. Since the house had been built twenty-five years previously, itexonerated Julsrud, eliminated the hoax theory, and negated [two reportsalleging fakery] at all the important points.”One enduring mystery—or conspiracy—stems from reports of the discovery ofancient Egyptian artifacts in the north end of the Grand Canyon at the beginningof the last century. According to a front-page article in the Phoenix Gazette ofApril 5, 1909, an expedition funded by the Smithsonian Institution had begunwork following the discovery of a “great underground citadel” in a cave “some 42miles up the [Colorado] river from the El Tovar Crystal canyon.”The article stated that a thirty-year employee of the Smithsonian, identified asG. E. Kinkaid, had discovered the cave a few months earlier while boating on theColorado River. The cavern was nearly inaccessible: the entrance was 1,486 feetbelow a sheer canyon wall.Once inside, Kinkaid found mummies and relics that he shipped to Washington,D.C. Quoting from a report by Kinkaid, the Gazette wrote, “On all the urns, orwalls over doorways, and tablets of stone which were found by the image are themysterious hieroglyphics, the key to which the Smithsonian Institute [sic] hopesyet to discover. The engraving on the tablets probably has something to do withthe religion of the people. Similar hieroglyphics have been found in southernArizona. Among the pictorial writings, only two animals are found. One is ofprehistoric type.” Kinkaid’s report also noted that in one large room weremummies, all male and all wrapped in a “bark fabric.”Other rooms contained cooking vessels and storage places, and one room thatsmelled “snaky” seemed to be filled with gas or chemicals. It was estimated thatas many as fifty thousand people could have lived in the caverns comfortably.According Kinkaid’s report, “The whole underground installation gives one ofshaky nerves the creeps.”The Gazette article also related that another Smithsonian archaeologist, S. A.Jordan, was making additional searches of the cave and had discovered evidencestrongly indicating that the cavern had once been inhabited by a race “oforiental origin, possibly from Egypt, tracing back to Ramses.” The scientistshad discovered several hundred rooms, linked by passageways running from themain passage. Some of these rooms included “articles which have never been knownas native to this country, and doubtless they had their origin in the orient.War weapons, copper instruments, sharp-edged and hard as steel, indicate thehigh state of civilization reached by these strange people.”The article’s conclusion was shocking. It argued that if the archaeologists’theories were “borne out by the translation of the tablets engraved withhieroglyphics, the mystery of the prehistoric peoples of North America, theirancient arts, who they were and whence they came, [would] be solved. Egypt andthe Nile, and Arizona and the Colorado [would] be linked by a historical chainrunning back to ages which staggers the wildest fancy of the fictionist.”Unfortunately, the century-old Phoenix Gazette article seems to be the only realevidence that this discovery ever took place. Some have called the story aplanted hoax, and officials at the Smithsonian continue to deny involvement inany such expedition or that Egyptian artifacts have ever been recovered in thecanyon.But the mystery lingers. One young man, who did not want his name involved inthis matter, related in the late 1990s that he was backpacking in the north endof the Grand Canyon when he came across concrete platforms. Knowing of theEgyptian artifacts story, he surmised that the platforms may have been the basefor cranes to lower heavy artifacts from the cave on the sheer rock face. DavidHatcher Childress, who founded the World Explorers Club, looked into the matter.After obtaining a map of the Grand Canyon, Childress and club members reported:Poring over the map, we were amazed to see that much of the area on the northside of the canyon has Egyptian names. The area around Ninety-four Mile Creekand Trinity Creek had areas (rock formations, apparently) with names like Towerof Set, Tower of Ra, Horus Temple, Osiris Temple, and Isis Temple. In theHaunted Canyon area were such names as the Cheops Pyramid, the Buddha Cloister,Buddha Temple, Manu Temple and Shiva Temple. Was there any relationship betweenthese places and the alleged Egyptian discoveries in the Grand Canyon?We called a state archaeologist at the Grand Canyon, and were told that theearly explorers had just liked Egyptian and Hindu names, but that it was truethat this area was off limits to hikers or other visitors, because of dangerouscaves. Indeed, this entire area with the Egyptian and Hindu place names in theGrand Canyon is a forbidden zone—no one is allowed into this large area. Wecould only conclude that this was the area where the vaults were located. Yettoday, this area is curiously off-limits to all hikers and even, in large part,park personnel.The Vatican has been long accused of keeping artifacts and ancient books intheir vast cellars, without allowing the outside world access to them. Thesesecret treasures, often of a controversial historical or religious nature, areallegedly suppressed by the Catholic Church because they might damage thechurch’s credibility, or perhaps cast their official texts in doubt. Sadly,there is overwhelming evidence that something very similar is happening with theSmithsonian Institution.HOAXES AND FORGERIES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s15]In addition to the problems of inconsistency that plague Darwin’s theory ofevolution, efforts to solve the “missing link” problem have been hampered byfalse discoveries.In 1887, for example, the Dutch anatomist Marie Eugène François Thomas DuBoismoved to the Dutch East Indies and joined the Dutch Army as a medical officer.Aided by two army engineers and some forced laborers, in 1890 DuBois moved hissearch for fossils to the island of Java, where two years previously a humanskull had been found. Once there, DuBois’s workers found an incomplete skulland, upon widening the search, a partial jawbone with three teeth attached, onthe banks of the Solo River. Further searches uncovered a molar, an intactskullcap, and a thighbone. In 1894, DuBois published a description of hisfossils, claiming that they came from one creature and that, when put together,they represented a link between ape and human that he called Pithecanthropuserectus, “ape-human that stands upright.” Informally, the fossils were known asJava Man.DuBois’s theory was never fully accepted even after his return to Europe in1895. Some scientists charged that the thighbone and skullcap were unrelated andrepresented two separate individuals. Others merely argued against DuBois’sclaim that the specimen represented an intermediate primate, or missing link.Stung by the controversy, DuBois had stopped discussing Java Man all together bythe turn of the century and hid the fossils away from the public in his home.Today, Java Man has been lumped in with other fossil discoveries, classified asa large, prehistoric hominid called Homo erectus.Certain “missing link” discoveries have turned out to be outright hoaxes. One ofthe most famous of these was the Piltdown Man, based on a large skull andjawbone found in a gravel pit at Piltdown, East Sussex, England, in 1912. Theartifact was given the impressive-sounding name Eoanthropus dawsoni or Dawson’sdawn-man, after British amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson, who claimed tohave collected the remains from pit workmen.But instead of being the missing link everyone was hoping for, Piltdown Manactually was revealed to be a gigantic hoax in 1953. Dawson and others,including even the famous Sherlock Holmes novelist Arthur Conan Doyle, weresuspected of forging the missing link by combining a modern human skull with thejawbone of an orangutan. Many suspect that whoever fabricated the Piltdown Man,and it may have consisted of more than one person, did so in a shortsightedeffort to support the theories of Darwin.The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded for so long because at the time of itspresentation, the scientific establishment had long supposed that the largemodern human brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet. The forgery had providedexactly the evidence that suited the theory.Public acceptance of anthropology increased in 1974 with the discovery of theskeleton of a hominid australopithecine female in the Afar Triangle region ofHadar, Ethiopia. American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, assisted byMaurice Taieb and Yves Coppens, suggested the name Lucy after the Beatles’ tune“Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” which was heard on a tape the night of thediscovery. Lucy, a three-and-a-half-foot-tall biped, initially was consideredmerely another Australopithecus africanus, a previously known hominid from thelate Pliocene epoch. It was sometime later, following other finds, that she wasrecognized as a separate species.In the months following Lucy’s discovery, Johanson’s team found prehistorichominid teeth and bones from at least thirteen individuals, collectively calledAustralopithecus 333. The fossils are estimated to be about 3.2 million yearsold and represent a species now known as Australopithecus afarensis. Becausethis species may be even older than the Neanderthals and even Homo erectus,Johanson’s group of fossils is sometimes known as humankind’s first family.Scholars Colin P. Groves, Charles E. Oxnard, and Louis Leakey have agreed thatAustralopithecus was totally different in morphology from humans. Grovescommented that “non-Darwinian” principles would be required to explain anyconnection between Lucy and modern humans.Conventional science now accepts that Neanderthals were also a completelyseparate race from humans as well. Following the first analysis of mitochondrialDNA (mtDNA) taken from the fossils from the Neander Valley, Germany, in 1997,National Geographic concluded that Neanderthals did not contribute substantiallyto the modern human genome.If the empirical evidence doesn’t support Darwin’s theory of evolution, what canaccount for our existence? Hominids, a term used to describe humans as well asclosely related apes, evolved at a slow and steady pace until about 450,000years ago, when the primate family tree began to divide, creating many separatebranches of species during the late Pleistocene epoch. Interestingly enough,this period of change coincides with dates during which the Sumerian tabletsdescribed extraterrestrials manipulating the human DNA.THE WEALTHY CONTROL RESEARCH [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s16]Woe be to those who attempt to argue against conventional thinking. According tomany independent researchers, there appears to be a conspiracy against anydiscovery that conflicts with prevailing wisdom. Consider the fate of Thomas E.Lee of the National Museum of Canada. In the early 1950s, Lee discoveredsophisticated stone tools caught in ice on Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron.These tools were proven to be at least 65,000 years old and perhaps as old as125,000 years, totally contradicting conventional theories concerning the datethat such well-fashioned stone tools were first created. Following hisdiscovery, Lee claimed he was “hounded” from his position, his work wasmisrepresented, and no one would publish his findings. Most of the artifacts hefound “vanished” into storage bins, and the museum director was fired forrefusing to discharge Lee.“The treatment of Lee was not an isolated case,” noted Cremo and Thompson inForbidden Archeology. “There exists in the scientific community a knowledgefilter that screens out unwelcome evidence. This process of knowledge filtrationhas been going on for well over a century and continues right up to the presentday.” One particularly exasperated researcher recently wrote, “Realize, thatscientific institutions, such as the Smithsonian and the National GeographicSociety, are set up by the world’s elite factions in the first place to eitherdebunk, distort or simply ignore any scientific data that tends to enlightenpeople about their true origins.”Michael Cremo said he saw in science evidence of both misfeasance andmalpractice. “You can find many cases where it’s just an automatic process. It’sjust human nature that a person will tend to reject things that don’t fit inwith his particular world view,” he said. Cremo cited the words of a youngpaleontologist and expert on ancient whale bones at the Museum of NaturalHistory in San Diego. Asked if he ever found signs of human markings on any ofthe bones, the scientist responded, “I tend to stay away from anything that hasto do with humans because it’s just too controversial.”Cremo was suspicious of activities by the Rockefeller Foundation in its fundingof Canadian paleoanthropologist Davidson Black, who conducted research in Chinaand came to the conclusion that humankind originated in Asia, specifically Chinaand Tibet. Correspondence between Black and his superiors with the foundationindicated that Black’s work was part of a broader agenda. One letter stated, “ …thus we may gain information about our [human] behavior of the sort that canlead to wide and beneficial control.” Cremo saw this as meaning that theresearch was being funded with the specific goal of control. “Control by whom?”Cremo wondered.“The motive to manipulate is not so hard to understand,” explained J. DouglasKenyon, publisher of the magazine Atlantis Rising. “There’s a lot of socialpower connected with explaining who we are and what we are,” he says. “Somebodyonce said knowledge is power. You could also say power is knowledge. Some peoplehave particular power and prestige that enables them to dictate the agenda ofour society. I think it’s not surprising that they are resistant to any change.”Kenyon believes that scientists today have become a virtual priest class,exercising many of the rights and prerogatives that their forebears in theindustrial-scientific revolution sought to wrest from an entrenched religiousestablishment. They set the tone and the direction for our civilization on aworldwide basis, he says. “If you want to know something today you usually don’tgo to a priest or a spiritually inclined person, you go to one of these peoplebecause they’ve convinced us that our world is a very mechanistic place, andeverything can be explained mechanically by the laws of physics and chemistrywhich are currently accepted by the establishment. … I think many people arestarting to see that the world view they are presenting, just doesn’t accountfor everything in human experience.”Brad Steiger, author of Worlds Before Our Own, wrote, “Archaeologists,anthropologists, and various academicians who play the ‘origins of Man’ game,reluctantly and only occasionally acknowledge instances where unique skeletaland cultural evidence from the prehistoric record suddenly appear long beforethey should and in places where they should not. These irritating artifactsdestroy the orderly evolutionary line that academia has for so long presented tothe public. Consequently, such data have been largely left buried in sitereports, forgotten storage rooms, and dusty archives where one suspects thatthere is a great deal of suppressed, ignored, and misplaced pre-historicalcultural evidence that would alter the established interpretations of humanorigins and provide us with a much clearer definition of what it means to behuman.”By the early twentieth century, the intellectual community had cemented itssupport around Darwin’s theories. Instead of challenging the status quo, it soonbecame much more prudent for the aspiring archaeologist or anthropologist tosimply ignore or dismiss any unorthodox data. Such attitudes are in full forcetoday.Did such distortion in the sciences come about by some flaw in the naturalevolution of scientific inquiry? The record indicates a conscious effort toderail true scientific investigation by a clique of wealthy and powerful people.“For a brief period during the late 1920s and early 1930s, Rockefellerphilanthropies flirted with, and ultimately abandoned, the field ofanthropology,” notes anthropologist Kevin Jones-Kern of Bowling Green StateUniversity. “During those crucial years and through their modest grants,however, they dramatically affected the course of anthropology.”The Rockefellers, along with other wealthy and elite American families, such asthe Mellons, Carnegies, and Gettys, gained unequaled control over many of thenation’s largest universities both through direct grants and through theirfoundations. But with the approach of World War II, these funds began to dry up,and certain types of scientists, such as anthropologists, found no jobsavailable upon graduation. There were few teacher openings and even fewer fundedopportunities for fieldwork. Those who did find work with colleges andcorporations were limited in what and how they investigated. “Relativelymunificent funding for the social sciences continued after this point, but in amore controlled and directed manner. One of the casualties of this restructuringwas the already limited Rockefeller support for anthropology,” statedJones-Kern.“Although the Rockefeller Foundation gave only half-hearted attention to thefield of anthropology, the repercussions of its relatively modest involvementwere profound and long-lasting. From sponsorship and publication of classicresearch studies, to the training of a generation of ethnologists, to thesolidification of sturdy university departments that trained future generationsof anthropologists, the Rockefeller Foundation greatly affected the course ofthe field spurned in 1934,” wrote Jones-Kern. “Thus, while Beardsley Ruml,Edmund Day, Sydnor Walker and their peers quietly working at the New Yorkoffices of the Rockefeller Foundation are not generally recognized as importantfigures in the history of the anthropology, perhaps they should be,” heconcluded. Of course, if one helps create something, than one has some degree ofcontrol over that thing.Some indication of the power of these families in scientific investigation maybe found in the list of founding members and presidents of the National ScienceBoard, the governing board of the National Science Foundation, whose membersserve as policy advisers to the U.S. Congress and the president: Chester I.Barnard (Rockefeller Foundation), Detlev W. Bronk (Rockefeller University),Charles Dollard (Carnegie Corporation of New York), and H. Guyford Stever(Carnegie Mellon University).One example of subtle control over research is the fact that even as the studyof human DNA was becoming more established and accepted, there was in academia asubtle persuasion away from incorporating deep DNA research in archaeologicalstudies. Instead, emphasis was placed on using carbon dating and theconventional categorization of artifacts into a predefined evolutionary line,usually beginning two million years or earlier.In addition, institutions have limited paleoanthropology to the study ofhominids at least a million years old. At least two proposals, from Berkeley andSouthern Methodist University, for study of more recent fossils were rejected bythe National Science Foundation for “lack of adequate scientific merit” due tothe paucity of relatively recent fossil hominids.In 1971, when as an undergraduate Donald Johanson found the bones of Lucy, heannounced a split in the evolutional chain of ancestors, much to the chagrin ofconventional anthropologists, who lambasted him for even offering such ahypothesis at such a young age. This set the stage for more restrainedhypotheses in ancient hominid studies, prompting the media to describe anyunorthodox ideas on evolution as exotic. Was this by design? Thus the funding ofpure science was controlled, and the general public and academia were distractedfrom any non-Darwinian theories.It should be noted that in 1974 Johanson graduated from the University ofChicago, a recipient of Rockefeller largesse, with a scholarship from theNational Institute of Dental Research that directed him to write a thesis onteeth. It was through grants from the National Science Foundation, the L.S.B.Leakey Foundation and the National Geographic Society that Johanson was able tocarry out his research in Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, andTanzania.In the 1800s, huge sphinx-like statues, such as winged bulls and a lion with ahuman head, were excavated in what was once the palace of the Assyrian kingSargon II, who ruled Mesopotamia from 721 to 705 BC. John D. Rockefellerpurchased much of the recovered art and transported it to New York.The Rockefellers’ interest in art and the social sciences in North Americareflect similar interests by the Rothschilds in Europe and the Middle East. AnIsraeli foundation called Yad Hanadiv, which means “benefactor” in Hebrew, wasestablished in 1958 in honor of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. According to itswebsite, Yad Hanadiv acts “on behalf of a number of Rothschild familyphilanthropic trusts, continuing a tradition of support for Jewish revival inPalestine begun by Baron Edmond de Rothschild in the second half of the 19thcentury.” Since the organization’s creation, it has been guided by an advisorycommittee comprised of members of the Rothschild family. As many as twelveRothschild Fellowships are awarded each year in the natural, exact, or lifesciences and engineering, and up to eight in the humanities and social sciences.During the past century, the Rothschilds were the largest financial supportersof archaeological digs in Palestine, and the famous Masada excavation of the1950s was actually called the Edmond de Rothschild Masada Dig. It has beenreported from several sources that the Rothschilds believe themselves descendedfrom the Sumerian king Nimrod, the biblical great-grandson of Noah. According tothe prestigious genealogical publication Burke’s Peerage, one Rothschild childborn in 1922 was named Albert Anselm Salomon Nimrod Rothschild.In 1947, a Bedouin shepherd exploring a cave in Palestine found jars thatcontained seven scrolls. He sold a few parchments to an antiques dealer for theequivalent of a few dollars. Eventually word of the discovery reached the earsof Hebrew University archaeologist Yigael Yadin, who mortgaged his home andtraveled into dangerous Arab areas seeking the scrolls. He managed to secureseven of them for his university, which promptly published them.Between 1947 and 1960, archaeologists pulled 972 ancient biblical andnonbiblical texts from twelve caves in modern-day Palestine. What many don’tknow, however, is that these texts, known together as the Dead Sea Scrolls,reveal the dominating influence of the Rockefellers. Although many of thescrolls have found their way to publications, “not so for the remainingscrolls,” Bible scholar and former intelligence analyst Patricia Eddy hasreported. “The Rockefeller Archaeological Museum in Palestine soon becameinvolved and managed to acquire the rest of the scrolls from the government ofJordan … who stipulated that no Jewish scholars be allowed access to the ancientJewish texts. Today, Israel controls the scrolls as a result of overrunning theplace where they were stored during the Six Day War of 1967 … these scrolls arelargely unpublished today (and) no one knows if all of them have been obtained.There is the possibility that others are in the possession of, or have beendestroyed by, the Bedouins.”Other members of the wealthy elite have exerted their influence overarchaeology. For example, Donald Johanson was involved in strange entanglementswith the wealthy Getty family. Jon Kalb, a Texas paleontologist who had studiedgeological depressions in Ethiopia for years and helped acquire funding forJohanson’s research, wrote in his 2001 book, Adventures in the Bone Trade, thatAnn Getty, who was married to Gordon Getty, heir to the Getty family’s oilfortune, was involved in Johanson’s work. Kalb reported:Mrs. Getty was then taking courses from [Tim] White [a University ofCalifornia–Berkeley paleoanthropologist associate of Johanson] at UCB and soonjoined [Johanson’s excavation] team. She became an outspoken supporter of Whiteand, during trips to Ethiopia (in her private Boeing 727), was in a position tomake large donations to the National Museum, winning influence in the Ethiopiangovernment. Worse for Johanson, Mr. Getty was the IHO’s [The Institute of HumanOrigins, which funded the majority of Johanson’s project] largest financialdonor and a member of its board. In April 1994, Getty abruptly withdrew hissupport from the institute, charging Johanson with mismanagement of funds andpersonnel. Because Getty was responsible for half of IHO’s nearly $2 millionannual budget, his defection was widely reported in the press, from the WallStreet Journal to the London Times.Archaeologists and anthropologists are not the only ones subjected to intensepressure to toe the official science line. In January 2012, the Wall StreetJournal published a letter from sixteen scientists, including NobelPrize–winning physicist Ivar Giaever, who resigned from the American PhysicalSociety over its warning that the evidence of global warming is“incontrovertible.” The scientists wrote that “stubborn scientific facts” argueagainst warming being a man-made phenomenon. They said a growing number ofdissenting scientists have serious doubts about the much-publicized and alarmistglobal-warming message being used to argue for new carbon taxes on the publicbut are afraid to speak up because of “fear of not being promoted—or worse.”“They have good reason to worry,” stated the letter. “In 2003, Dr. Chris deFreitas, the editor of the journal Climate Research, dared to publish apeer-reviewed article with the politically incorrect (but factually correct)conclusion that the recent warming is not unusual in the context of climatechanges over the past thousand years. The international warming establishmentquickly mounted a determined campaign to have Dr. de Freitas removed from hiseditorial job and fired from his university position. Fortunately, Dr. deFreitas was able to keep his university job.”CIA INVOLVEMENT [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s17]When Donald Johanson and his team arrived in Ethiopia to set out on his famousarchaeological dig, he came merely days after a military coup that oustedEthiopia’s ruler, Emperor Haile Selassie. When Johanson arrived, he demanded apermit for field investigation from Ethiopian Antiquities Administrationdirector Bekele Negussie, who had previously declined Johanson’s authorizationdue to politics.According to Jon Kalb, who later became a competitor of Johanson, Negussie cameto his office one day at lunchtime and told him that Johanson had accused Kalbof being a CIA agent and receiving covert money from a CIA front organizationknown as FORGE. Negussi said Johanson had also alleged that Kalb was connectedto the U.S. embassy somehow. The accusations against Kalb plagued him for years,and they eventually led to his expulsion from Ethiopia. He has since discussedhow other scientists suffered similar charges. Johanson said Kalb’s charges werebaseless although he admitted that he, as well as many other scientists inforeign lands, was sometimes questioned about the national affairs of othercountries by officials of the U.S. Government.Was Kalb actually a CIA agent, as per Johanson’s accusation? Or were any othermembers covertly working for the agency? It is possible the CIA somehow wasinvolved with the archaeological community to gain access to many otherwiseimpenetrable parts of the world. In fact, accusations of CIA involvement amongarchaeologists and anthropologists were not totally without merit, according toa government committee. The circuitously named Select Committee to StudyGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called theChurch Committee after its chairman, Democratic senator Frank Church, stated ina 1976 report that the CIA had penetrated a large contingent of Americanacademia:The CIA is now using several hundred American academics, who in addition toproviding leads and, on occasion, making introductions for intelligencepurposes, occasionally write books and other material to be used for propagandapurposes abroad.” These academics are located in over 100 American colleges,universities, and related institutes. At the majority of institutions, no oneother than the individual concerned is aware of the CIA link. At the others, atleast one university official is aware of the operational use made of academicson his campus. In addition, there are several American academics abroad whoserve operational purposes, primarily the collection of intelligence. … Althoughthe numbers are not as great today as in 1966, there are no prohibitions toprevent an increase in the operational use of academics.The report went on to state that the Church Committee was “disturbed” by theCIA’s lack of appreciation for the dangers it caused for the academics andinstitutions involved in its operations.Such collusion between human sciences, the National Science Foundation, and theCIA continues even today. In 2004, as a result of a Freedom of Information Actrequest, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a memorandumof understanding between the NSF and the CIA discussing joint funding inmathematics and the physical sciences. This was placed under the rubric ofcombating terrorism.It can be rationalized that the CIA might involve itself in scientificactivities in order to enhance national security. But could its involvement withscience have a more controlling purpose, such as protecting the officialnarrative of our species’s genesis?Several researchers place the CIA in the center of a money merry-go-round thatbegins with institutions of higher learning and foundations, then spins off intoconferences, charitable and educational associations, and student groups and oninto journalism and the mass media.If someone knew of extraterrestrial intervention in human development in thepast and did not want that information made public, they would certainly try tolimit archaeological and paleontological investigations to only the earliesttime periods of two million years or more. Could it be that those at the top arecontrolling science in order to blunt our discovery of our true human origins?HUMAN ORIGINS CONTROVERSY [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s18]Since the release of the Darwin’s books, the public has been told that humansslowly evolved from apes between fifteen and thirty million years ago. Yet in1967, when molecular biologists Allan Wilson and Vincent Sarich of theUniversity of California used an immunological study to compare proteinreactions in the blood of African apes and humans, their experiment indicatedthat humans and apes began evolving apart from each other only five millionyears ago. Naturally, they were roundly booed by anthropologists.In the early 1980s, Wilson again incensed his conventional associates bysubmitting a mitochondrial Eve thesis, which proposed that all modern humanraces diverged recently from a single population while older human species, suchas Neanderthal and Homo erectus, became extinct. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) aregenes that sit in the mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within eachcell, not in the nucleus, and are passed from mother to child. After comparingpeople of different racial backgrounds, Wilson and his coworkers concluded thatall modern humans evolved from one “lucky mother” in Africa about 150,000 yearsago. Some wits have suggested that perhaps her name was Lucy. This finding mayprove most significant in light of the ancient Sumerian tale of the creation ofman.The implications of Wilson’s proposal were extreme: that modern humans suddenlyevolved from a single African population roughly two hundred thousand to threehundred thousand years ago. According to geneticist Mark Stoneking, one ofWilson’s former students, the theory then posits that we “spread across and outof Africa between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago and replaced completely, withoutany interbreeding, the archaic populations from earlier migrations from Africa.The evidence in favor of this hypothesis is the fact that the earliest fossilsof anatomically modern humans come from Africa, and that early modern humanfossils from regions outside Africa tend to be more similar to those from Africathan to archaic human fossils from the same region.”There were attacks and recriminations among the scientists, but eventuallyWilson and Sarich’s evolutionary worldview prevailed. Stoneking has sinceexplained the underlying causes for science’s concurrence on the issue.Ultimately, the controversy was resolved not through rhetoric but, of course,through additional data and analyses. The resulting view of our relationship toother apes, which is widely accepted today … is remarkably similar to theresults that Sarich and Wilson published more than 40 years ago: namely, that weshare a close relationship with African apes, having diverged from them onlyapproximately 5–7 million years ago. … One can see the same logic at work hereas with the early incorrect views about our relationships with apes: namely, thedesire to see “us” as special—where “us” now refers to Europeans—compared withother groups, because it took a long time for us to become so special.Despite the mitochondrial Eve’s attack on our preconceptions of widespread humanevolution, Stoneking has suggested that nothing has contradicted the thesissince it was presented. “All analyses of mtDNA variation in contemporary humanpopulations basically agree: she lived in Africa roughly 150,000–200,000 yearsago, and modern humans then began spreading across and out of Africa between50,000 and 100,000 years ago, with no evidence that any archaic, non-Africanpopulations contributed their mtDNA to us—a view that is remarkably similar tothat which we published more than 20 years ago.”In a 2011 article, Stoneking reminded readers how conventional science treatsunwelcome evidence. “The idealized view of science and scientists holds thatwhen data contradict theory, no matter how long or how well that theory hasperformed, scientists must reject the old theory and come up with a newexplanation to account for the new data. The reality, as any scientist knows, isthat it is difficult to overcome ideas that have dominated a field for a longtime; instead, there is a tendency to reject the data—and the scientists—whichdo not fit the theory,” he wrote.REMOTE VIEWING HUMAN ORIGINS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s19]The idea of early intervention from off planet is not relegated to academics andbook writers. U.S. military intelligence officers, trained in the psychicmethodology called remote viewing, saw Earth originally seeded with protohumans.From the late 1970s to 1995, the U.S. Army utilized about two dozen remoteviewers to successfully conduct psychic spying on the old Soviet Union and othernations. There are those who even claim that since the psychic spying used byboth sides pierced all secrecy, it ended the Cold War.One of the most successful of the Army-trained remote viewers was JosephMcMoneagle, one of the original members of the military unit eventually calledProject Stargate. In 1984, McMoneagle was awarded the Legion of Merit for“producing crucial and vital intelligence unavailable from any other source” tothe intelligence community.In 1983, working with Robert A. Monroe, founder of the Monroe Institute inFaber, Virginia, which provided basic out-of-body orientation for many of themilitary remote viewers, McMoneagle conducted a session seeking to discover theorigin of humans. During the 129-minute session, he described a shoreline onwhat appeared to him to be a primitive Earth. He later estimated a time of aboutthirty million to fifty million years after the time of the dinosaurs. Cavortingon this shoreline was a large family of protohumans—hairy animals about fourfeet in height, walking upright and possessing eyes exhibiting a spark ofintelligence despite a somewhat smaller cranial capacity.Two things surprised McMoneagle in this session. These creatures appeared to beaware of his psychic presence, and they did not originate at that location.McMoneagle described his experience thus in his 1998 book, The Ultimate TimeMachine:This particular species of animal is put … specifically in that barrier place …called the meeting of the land and the sea. … I also get the impression thatthey’re … ah … they were put there. They mysteriously appeared. They are notdescended from an earlier species, they were put there … [by a] seed ship … no,that’s not right. Keep wanting to say ship, but it’s not a ship. I keep seeing a… myself … I keep seeing … oh, hell, for lack of a better word, let’s call it alaboratory, where they are actually inventing these creatures. They are actuallyconstructing animals from genes. Why would they be doing that? Can we do thisyet … here and now? Like cutting up genes and then pasting them back together.You know, sort of like splicing plants … or grafting them, one to another. …Interesting, it’s like they are building eggs by injecting stuff into them witha mixture of DNA or gene parts or pieces.As to who “they” might have been, he could only describe what he suspected wasan “implanted picture” of a delicate-looking, aquiline-featured humanoidunclothed and possessing a prehensile tail and large “doe-like” eyes. Thisstrange being seemed to be using a flashing light that produced frequencies ofenergy. Searching his mind for a corollary, McMoneagle blurted out, “It’s a growlight, for Christ’s sake.”McMoneagle said he was disturbed by the impression that this was like someonetending a garden and planting seeds, but “there isn’t any concern about theseeds after they are planted.” He added, “It’s simply like … well … put theseseeds here and on to better and bigger business. No concern about backtrackingand checking on the condition of the seeds. They can live or die, survive orperish.”He said the session ended with him moving closer in time and seeing dramaticchanges as the small hairy creatures grew both in size and abilities intoherding humans. He also cautioned against attempting to make public anyinformation that disturbs people’s preconceived ideas.Additional evidence for surveillance over humans in the past can be found in TheBook of Enoch the Prophet, a compilation of fragments of a Judaic book writtenby a variety of authors contemporary with biblical scribes. An Ethiopic editionof this book survived and was discovered in 1768 in Ethiopia by Scotsman JamesBruce. Although considered a book of the Bible for five centuries, The Book ofEnoch eventually was excluded from orthodox versions in favor of the book ofRevelation. Both books contain some of the most puzzling and controversialpassages in the Bible.Chapter 12 of The Book of Enoch states, “Before all these things Enoch wasconcealed; nor did any one of the sons of men know where he was concealed, wherehe had been, and what had happened. He was wholly engaged with the holy ones,and with the Watchers in his days. … And behold the Watchers called me Enoch thescribe. Then the Lord said to me: Enoch, scribe of righteousness, go tell theWatchers of heaven, who have deserted the lofty sky, and their holy everlastingstation, who have been polluted with women. And have done as the sons of men do,by taking to themselves wives, and who have been greatly corrupted on the earth.…”Throughout The Book of Enoch, it is made clear that the Watchers were not humanbut came from the heavens and that humans were their “offspring” to whom theyimparted knowledge. “Destroy all the souls addicted to dalliance, and theoffspring of the Watchers, for they have tyrannized over mankind,” the writercommands in chapter 10, verse 18. This same theme is found in Genesis 6:4 (NewInternational Version): “The Nefilim were on the earth in those days—and alsoafterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children bythem. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.” The Holman Bible Dictionarydefines the Old Testament Nefilim as “ancient heroes who, according to mostinterpreters, are the products of sexual union of heavenly beings and humanwomen.”In his 1978 book, NASA engineer Maurice Chatelain concluded, “Can anyone reallythink that all the fantastic knowledge in astronomy, mathematics, geodesy, andmany other sciences was acquired by mankind without outside help? Frankly, is itnot much more logical to accept the idea that all this knowledge was brought byastronauts who came from a another world, just as many legends and the Bibletell us, or that the advancement of mankind was stimulated by some very highlydeveloped cultures located in the Land of Mu or Atlantis, which were visitedeven earlier by outside civilizations from within the solar system or evendistant galaxies?”"},{"pageContent":"ANCIENT EVIDENCE—WORLDWIDE ANOMALIES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha04]EVIDENCE OF PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATIONS ABOUND THROUGHOUT the planet but areusually sloughed off as anomalies, especially because such accounts usuallyinclude myths of sky-traveling visitors. Unexplained manufactured sites, such asStonehenge and Silbury Hill in Britain, the huge heads of Easter Island, thePeruvian Nazca lines, the Great Serpent Mound of Ohio, and the controversialprehistoric “rock wall” east of Dallas, Texas, seem to indicate a technologylost in prehistory.The roster of strange anomalies around the world includes about sixty unusuallysmall ancient Chinese porcelain “seals” discovered all over Ireland in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a time when there was no known commercebetween the Emerald Isle and China. Today these artifacts have been identifiedas porcelain seals originating in the Dehua kilns in the Fujian Province ofChina from the earliest Qing Dynasty (221–207 BC). It has been speculated thatthe seals were brought from China by the seafaring Phoenicians, by ancient Irishtribes traveling as far as China, or by far-ranging medieval Irish monks.Further evidence connecting cultures from opposite sides of the Earth came inSeptember 1996, when Han Ping Chen, an authority on the ancient Chinese Shangdynasty, confirmed that markings found on Central American figures dated to morethan three thousand years ago were clearly Chinese characters. The figures werefrom the Olmecs, forerunners of the Aztec and Mayan civilizations, and werediscovered in Mexico in 1955. Smithsonian archaeologist Betty Meggers supportedChen’s analysis, stating, “Writing systems are too arbitrary and complex. Theycannot be independently reinvented.”Evidence of human activity (tools, fireplaces, etc.) at Monte Verde inLlanquihue Province in southern Chile has been dated to around 14,800 BC, thuspredating Noah’s Flood by three thousand years, as many researchers, based onthe obvious water erosion on the Sphinx plus other evidence in Mesopotamia,believe the flood occurred about 11,500 BC. The findings at this site, nowconsidered the oldest human settlement in the Americas, initially were dismissedby the scientific community but today gradually have found some acceptance, eventhough it destroys long-held beliefs about the occupation of both North andSouth America, as the date 14,800 BC places it into the last ice age, whichwould have made a Siberian land bridge impassible.Mysterious life-size crystal skulls dated to at least 3,600 years ago have beenrecovered in South America. A study published in the May 2008 edition of theJournal of Archaeological Science detailed how a team of British and Americanresearchers, using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, found that acrystal skull in the British Museum had been worked and shaped using tools notavailable to the ancient Aztecs or Mayans. So they concluded that the museum’sskull may have been produced in the 1950s or later. “Some of them are quitegood, but some of them look like they were produced with a Black & Decker insomeone’s garage,” remarked Cardiff University professor Ian Freestone. Despitesuch efforts to explain away the crystal skulls, their true manufacture remainsa mystery. The fact remains that many of the existent skulls are made from milkyor clear rock crystal found in suitably large deposits only in Brazil,Madagascar, and even the Alps. Both the dating and locations in which the clearrock crystal skulls were found argue against simple forgery.In Cuzco, Peru, long holes bored in ancient stone blocks exhibit score marksthat show the use of some sort of high-speed rotary or vibrational drill,indicating that someone may have had access to such equipment, rather than theholes being simply modern hoaxes.Throughout England, France, and Germany today stand many ancient stone fortsconstructed in defensible positions—there are at least fifty just inScotland—built with large rocks that at some point were vitrified, melted fromsuch heat as to become fused and glassy. The heat necessary to produce such aneffect—up to 1,100 degrees Celsius (1,980 degrees Fahrenheit)—ruled out thepossibility that the stones were melted by conventional fires. Due to the factthat the vitrification took place at the weakest point in the walls, manybelieve the fire was brought on by attackers, although no one can imagine howthey generated such sustained heat.Dr. E. W. Matvegeva with the Central Scientific Research Department of Geologyand Exploitation of Precious Metals in Moscow reported in 1992 that tiny spiralsof tungsten and copper were found by Russian geologists in the Ural Mountains.These particles were studied at four scientific institutions and were found tomeasure between .0003 millimeters and 3 centimeters (from about oneone-hundred-thousandth of an inch to a little over one inch). They were dated tobetween three hundred thousand and one hundred thousand years ago, yet theproportions of their spirals were so regular that they could have been producedonly by mechanical means. No one knows what purpose the spirals served. Todaynanotechnology is commonplace, but such advances only began in the 1970s.What appeared to be a computer dated almost a hundred years before Jesus wasdiscovered in 1900 off the island of Antikythera near Crete. Known as theAntikythera mechanism, the device contained a system of differential gears notknown to have been used until the 1700s. Many believe it is an artifactpredating Greek culture that was looted and then lost while being shipped toRome. Some think the mechanism may have been an early personal computer, as itsdoor contained at least two thousand characters, composing what researchers havereferred to as an instruction manual. Its attachment to the mechanism impliedthat it was designed for ease of transport and personal use. Studies in 2011determined that the mechanism is an astronomical calculator whose tiny gears cantrack celestial bodies. A system of thirty-seven hand-cranked interlocking dialskeep track of the day of the year, the positions of the sun and the moon andperhaps other planets, as well as predicting eclipses. Cardiff Universityprofessor Michael Edmunds, who headed a recent study of the mechanism, stated,“This device is just extraordinary, the only thing of its kind. The design isbeautiful, the astronomy is exactly right. The way the mechanics are designedjust makes your jaw drop. Whoever has done this has done it extremely carefully… in terms of historic and scarcity value, I have to regard this mechanism asbeing more valuable than the Mona Lisa.”A five-inch-tall terra-cotta vessel containing a copper cylinder with an ironrod inside, discovered in an Iraqi village and dating from at least 220 BCturned out to be nothing less than a battery. When grape juice, lemon juice, orvinegar was added to this and other similar objects, which have become known asthe Baghdad batteries, it became an acidic electrolyte solution that produced ahalf volt of electricity that may have been used for electroplating gold andsilver. Since to acknowledge the battery’s use for electroplating at so early atime would upset conventional history, this theory has been largely dismissed bymodern scientists. Paul Craddock of the British Museum explained, “The exampleswe see from this region and era are conventional gild plating and mercurygilding. There’s never been any untouchable evidence to support theelectroplating theory.” But as pointed out by Marjorie Senechal, a professor ofthe history of science and technology at Smith College, “I don’t think anyonecan say for sure what they were used for, but they may have been batteriesbecause they do work.”Carvings located twenty-five feet above the floor in the ancient Temple of SetiI in Abydos, Egypt, resemble nothing less than two jet airplanes, possibly asubmarine, and an Apache attack helicopter. Their presence has been noted byrecent travelers and reportedly was mentioned in an 1842 report, yet no oneknows what they truly represent. Researchers have wondered if the carvings inSeti’s temple might be connected to small delta-wing “jet planes” still ondisplay in the Gold Museum in Bogotá, Colombia. The diminutive models, estimatedto be at least 1,500 years old, have been explained away as stylized bees orflying fish, but no one has explained the presence of both horizontal andvertical tail fins, not found on any animal.In August 1997, two German researchers, Peter Belting and Conrad Lübbers, testeda scale model of one of the gold Bogotá “jets” to determine whether itdemonstrated true flight characteristics. Dubbing their 1:16 scale modelGoldflyer II, they attached a jet engine at the rear, which theoreticallyallowed room for three passengers in the front. Did it fly? According tojournalist Philip Coppens, a frequent contributor to Nexus and Atlantis Risingmagazines,The proof is in the demonstration, and in this case, the proof is there:Goldflyer II behaved impeccably, its landings being a thing of beauty. It isimpressive to see enthusiasts take this approach and demonstrate their case—noone can argue with the flight capabilities of the “insect” as it is. This iswhat the model looks like, and this is how it flies. But the definitive answeris still in the future. In my opinion, [the German experimenters] have been ableto demonstrate that the artifact is not an insect. At the moment, they have onlybeen able to prove it is an anomaly, an “item’”that has all the characteristicsof an airplane. But is it one? Or is it something else? Only new evidence, orcomparisons with other findings of a similar nature, might give us the finalanswer.Cuneiform Babylonian tablets in the British Museum describe the phases of Venus,the four largest moons of Jupiter, and the seven largest satellites of Saturn,none of which could have been seen in ancient Babylon without the aid oftelescopes.Many other artifacts indicate advanced knowledge in the far distant past, andnot only in the Western world. One example is what seems to be an X-ray machinepossessed by China’s emperor Qin Shi Huang, who lived from 259 to 210 BC. Thisdevice was described by contemporary scribes as a rectangular mirror about fourfeet wide and five feet nine inches in height that “illuminates the bones of thebody.” It was said that when a person stood before this device, medicalpractitioners could detect any hidden malady within the organs.An ancient Brahman medical text compiled about 1500 BC called the SactyaGrantham described what appeared to be an early vaccination technique. Itstated, “Take on the tip of a knife the contents of the inflammation, inject itinto the arm of a man, mixing it with his blood. A fever will follow but themalady will pass very easily and will create no complications.” This was some3,500 years before British scientist Edward Jenner was credited with developingthe smallpox vaccination in the 1800s.Maps by Turkish admiral Piri Reis dating from 1513 and still available at thelibrary of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, though not usually displayed for thepublic, are said to be based on earlier maps predating Alexander the Great. ThePiri Reis map and his other charts accurately depict the Amazon basin of SouthAmerica and the northern coastline of Antarctica, neither of which was surveyeduntil after the advent of aircraft in the twentieth century. The accuracy ofthese maps regarding Antarctica is especially puzzling because it has been underan ice cap for at least four thousand years. Piri Reis wrote that he made use ofcharts and maps dating back to ancient Greece, whose intellectuals acknowledgedthat they drew from even older Egyptian and Mesopotamian sources. In a letterdated July 6, 1960, Air Force colonel Harold Z. Ohlmeyer of the EighthReconnaissance Tactical Squadron of the Strategic Air Command stated, “Thegeographic detail shown in the lower part of the [Piri Reis] map agrees veryremarkably with the results of the seismic profile made across the top of theice-cap by the Swedish-British Antarctic Expedition of 1949. This indicates thecoastline had been mapped before it was covered by the ice-cap.” The discoveryof ice-encased Cenozoic unicellular algae in 1983 indicated that Antarctica mayhave been at least partly free of ice as late as three million years ago.The late professor Charles Hapgood, who taught the history of science at KeeneCollege in New Hampshire, advanced the theory in 1953 that Antarctica may havemoved farther south by some two thousand miles due to “Earth-crust displacement”and therefore could have been partially free of ice until as late as 4000 BC.This is still a thousand years before traditional academics believe that thefirst true civilizations of Egypt and Sumer with their seafaring explorersbegan. The idea that someone had accurately mapped an ice-free Antarctica inprehistoric times paled beside the fact that Piri Reis’s 1513 map also depictedthe correct position of the Falkland Islands, not discovered until 1592, and therivers of South America—the Orinoco, Amazon, Paraná, Uruguay, and others notfully charted until the advent of satellites. The Piri Reis maps were notflukes. Another Turkish map from 1559 depicts Alaska and Siberia joinedtogether, indicating that, unless the Bering Strait was intentionally omitted,this was a copy of a map made more than twelve thousand years ago.Author Erich von Däniken saw evidence of slight distortions of the SouthAmerican coast on the Piri Reis map. He claimed this same type of distortion isnoticeable on satellite photos in which corners of pictures warp due to thecurve of the Earth’s surface. Von Däniken concluded that Piri Reis’s sourcedocuments may have been drawn from aerial photographs. Of course, the thoughtthat someone may have flown over Antarctica and South America prior to 4000 BCcannot be seriously considered within the context of traditional history. Suchevidence drove both Hapgood and his student, author Graham Hancock, to speculatethat a previously unknown and very advanced civilization existed in prehistorictimes. Neither man appeared willing to publicly postulate that such acivilization might have been the result of extraterrestrial contact, yet theevidence for this supposition continues to grow.HOARY STRUCTURES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s20]Many ancient monuments attest civilizations existing long before acceptedhistory. For example, a rectangular ziggurat recently was discovered under aboutseventy-five feet of water off the island of Yonaguni, southwest of Okinawa.This structure is six hundred feet long and ninety feet high and is said to beabout more than eight thousand years old, meaning it would be comparable (byunconventional dating) to the pyramids of Egypt and predate the ziggurats of theBabylonians. The structure includes two closely spaced eight-foot pillars, awide wedge called the Loop Road, a straight wall named the Dividing Wall, anL-shaped “stage,” and a depressed “pool” with two large holes at its edge. Thosewho believe that it is artificial argue that this number of regular-shapedobjects in one small area make natural formation highly unlikely. BostonUniversity geologist Robert M. Schoch, who has claimed that the Sphinx is aboutten thousand years old, was impressed by the regularity of the structure’ssteps. Although retaining the belief that its regularities are most probably thework of repeated scoring by the tides, he has written that if it is indeed anartificial structure, “the Yonaguni Monument appears to bear testimony to apreviously unknown, yet very early and highly sophisticated civilization.”The purposes of some such structures have changed over the years. Theworld-famous stone circles at Stonehenge, begun in 3100 BC, a date comparablewith the Early Dynastic period of ancient Egypt, were considered only monumentsfor pagan rituals until the 1700s, when British antiquarian William Stukeley,considered by many to be a forerunner of archaeology, proposed that the buildersof Stonehenge knew about magnetism and had aligned the stone circles withmagnetic north. Then, in 1962, Gerald Hawkins of Boston University provoked anoutcry in the scientific community by using computer technology to prove thatStonehenge was nothing less than a giant observatory that could be used topredict both solar and lunar eclipses.Again the status quo weighed in, this time against Hawkins’s new ideas. Britisharchaeologist Richard J. C. Atkinson, who directed excavations at Stonehenge forthe Ministry of Works from 1950 and 1964, remained adamant that the builders ofStonehenge were merely “howling barbarians” and that Hawkins’s theory was“tendentious, arrogant, slipshod and unconvincing.”The scientific outcry became muted after the much-respected British astronomerSir Fred Hoyle agreed with Hawkins and went even further, stating thatStonehenge was a model of our solar system and could predict the date of a lunareclipse nineteen years into the future.Hawkins and Hoyle had merely added to the growing evidence that the ancients hadmuch more sophisticated knowledge about the solar system and the stars thanpreviously believed. This concept was further support by the recent discoveriesof Stonehenge-type ruins in South Africa and Brazil.In 2006, the BBC announced the discovery of a similar ancient stone structure inthe state of Amapa, in northern Brazil. The structure is comprised of 127 largeblocks of stone, each well preserved and weighing several tons, driven into theground on top of a hill. The stones are evenly spaced and placed upright.Judging from pottery found nearby, the site, thought to have been an observatoryor place of worship, was built about two thousand years ago and thus longpredates European colonization. It evinces a sophisticated knowledge ofastronomy and has been compared to Stonehenge, although the latter is mucholder, dated to about 3000 to 1600 BC.The South African circular ruin, called Adam’s Calendar, is perched on the rimof the Transvaal Escarpment and is believed to be more than two hundred thousandyears old. African shaman Sanusi Credo Mutwa described the site as the mostsacred place on Earth. Based on the descriptions of the African home of theSumerian overlord Enki, researcher Michael Tellinger believed the site mightwell have been the laboratory of the Enki, who, according to ancient tablets,created a hybrid there by genetically engineering human and alien DNA.In addition, Tellinger and his associates noted that none of the thousands ofsuch circular ruins have openings, although modern archaeologists have calledthe South African structures kraals, corrals for cattle. The only gateways inthese kraals are those that have been knocked out recently. However, there werechannels leading into the center of the structure and connecting to othercircles. It has been theorized by Tellinger and others that these were used formoving energy out of the circle.Similar circular stone ruins, with spokes radiating outward but visible onlyfrom the air, have been found stretching from Syria to Saudi Arabia. Newsatellite-mapping technologies coupled with an aerial photography program inJordan have revealed thousands of these giant ancient circles termed geolyphs.Researchers believe that they date to prehistoric times.One example is the Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian, or Deir Mar Musa,located fifty miles north of Damascus in Syria. Termed Syria’s Stonehenge byarchaeologist Robert Mason of the Royal Ontario Museum, who happened upon thesite in 2009, the area contains stone tools dating back as far as ten thousandyears, as well as stone circles. The stone circles were described as“corral-like” and were said to be used as traps for gazelles and other animals.Mason said much work is needed to decipher the mysteries of Deir Mar Musa, butsuch effort is uncertain due to the violence and political upheaval in thatcountry.“In Jordan alone we’ve got stone-built structures that are far more numerousthan [the] Nazca Lines, far more extensive in the area that they cover, and farolder,” said David Kennedy, a professor of classics and ancient history at theUniversity of Western Australia. The purpose of the stone “wheels” is unknown.Kennedy said theories that they were houses or cemeteries are unsatisfactory.Tellinger believed that the African circular structures were created on leylines—theoretical lines on the ground that intensify or carry theelectromagnetic energy of Earth, similar to the popular Chinese concept of fengshui—and were used to channel Earth’s energy. Along with a satellitecommunications technician, Tellinger used an electromagnetic flow meter tomeasure the temperature gradient per foot from more than six hundred feetbelowground to the surface. They found the average temperature outside thestones circles to be about 42 degrees Fahrenheit while inside the circles itrose to more than 136 degrees. “It was extraordinary!” exclaimed Tellinger. “Ourmeasurements in sound frequency, heat signature and electromagnetic intensitywere infinitely higher inside the circles than on the outside. In fact, themaximum energy could not be measured on our instruments. It went beyond 375gigahertz.”“Now that we understand the energy-generating principle, it seems that this is agood example of an early diagram of an energy-generating complex. The energy ischanneled via the channels that connect them all together, they create acontinuous energy grid. The simple non-polar, or radiant energy would have beenused for everything as we imagine it today—and more. It is not a dangerous formof energy like the polar energy we use today,” said Tellinger, referring to theAC/DC-generated electricity commonly in use today.Found within the circular ruins were several carvings of a serpent in the samehorseshoe shape of the Greek letter omega, Ω, long used to symbolize the unit ofelectrical resistance, the ohm. The identically shaped snake image can be foundon ancient Greek coins.THE CORAL CASTLE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s21]The Earth-drawn energy mentioned by Tellinger may be comparable to that of theSerbian-born inventor Nikola Tesla, who in 1900 constructed Wardenclyffe Toweron Long Island to establish intercontinental wireless transmission of electricalenergy. Initially funded for $150,000, the majority of which came from Americanfinancier J. P. Morgan, the project was scrapped after Morgan realized thatwireless energy would eliminate the profit from his investments in copperwiring. Tesla had successfully demonstrated wireless energy transfer in 1891 andclaimed that he could draw abundant energy from the earth.This same energy manipulation may be behind Florida’s curious Coral Castle, acollection of stone carvings and monoliths assembled by Latvian immigrant EdwardLeedskalnin. Standing no more than five feet tall and never weighing more than120 pounds, Leedskalnin moved to Florida about 1919 and, working primarily atnight, constructed his coral rock collection during the next twenty years. Inthe mid-1930s, Leedskalnin moved his entire collection to Homestead, Florida.Some say this move came following an altercation with vandals, while otherscontend it was to locate on better aligned ley lines.The site includes more than 1,500 tons of dense coral blocks, some weighing upto 30 tons. Yet there was no evidence of modern machinery being used, andLeedskalnin would offer only polite but cryptic responses to questionsconcerning his method of construction. On more than one occasion he did state,“I have discovered the secrets of the pyramids, and have found out how theEgyptians and the ancient builders in Peru, Yucatan and Asia, with onlyprimitive tools, raised and set in place blocks of stone weighing many tons!”Leedskalnin explained that science had an incorrect knowledge of atomicstructure and electricity. He said all forms of existence are made up of threecomponents—north and south poles and neutral particles of matter. Leedskalninsaid he understood the laws involved in the relationship of the Earth tocelestial alignments. He also said he had an intimate understanding of magnetismand even claimed to have cured himself of tuberculosis through the use ofmagnets. Leedskalnin died of kidney failure in 1951 after checking himself intoa hospital. Coral Castle was added to the National Register of Historic Placesin 1984.One account of Leedskalnin’s methods came from Tellinger, who related, “Thetruck drivers used to deliver the rocks and stand around the corner as hesingle-handedly offloaded these huge stones. And then he would come round thecorner and tell them they could take the truck and go. Nobody knows how he didit, but there were reports of these eerie sounds and high frequency pitch noisesand so forth but two school kids reported seeing him from the bushes nearbyoffloading these rocks with ice cream cones in his hands. We are dealing withsound and the focusing of sound frequencies. This is what I refer to as the icecream cone phenomenon.” He added that in San Jose, California, there is a museumwhich houses “beautiful cones that were extracted from temples in [ancientSumer] that commemorate the building of the temples.” Tellinger theorized thatsuch conelike objects were used to somehow channel natural energy through theenergy of the individual user.In contemplating the idea of moving objects by sonic energy, one cannot help butrecall the biblical story of Joshua and the battle of Jericho in which ram’shorns were sounded, the Israelites were exhorted to shout, and the city wallscrumbled. Yet another account of the levitation of giant stones by sonicfrequency came from retired New Zealand airline pilot and author Bruce Cathie,who related an account of Tibetan monks lifting huge boulders up a mountainsideby the use of sound frequencies. This feat was observed by a Swedish doctor whohad traveled deep into Tibet in 1939. Using a collection of drums and trumpets,the chanting monks were able to levitate a large stone some 250 meters (820feet) upward to a ledge in only three minutes.Interestingly, a cache of cone-shaped stone tools made of basalt has been foundon Easter Island, the site of the huge monolithic stone giants. Researchers havelong wondered how the people were able to lift the massive statues intoposition. Perhaps the stone cones provide the answer.STRANGE ARTIFACTS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s22]Also in South Africa can be found the Klerksdorp spheres, small round objectscollected near Ottosdal, South Africa, by miners and locals fromthree-billion-year-old pyrophyllite deposits. Ranging in size from one-half tofour inches in diameter, the spheres are found in the Klerksdorp Museum, locatedabout seventy miles from Ottosdal. Described by some as “out-of-place artifacts”possibly manufactured by nonhumans, the spheres reveal well-defined and parallellatitudinal grooves or ridges when cut open and are balanced to near perfection,an impossible feat even with today’s technology. Naturally, there is controversyover both the nature and creation of the spheres. One, for example, has threeparallel grooves around its equator.Conventional geologists, such as Paul V. Heinrich, say the strange structure ofthe hematite spheres indicates they are “natural concretions that arepseudomorphs after original pyrite concretions.” He concluded that the spheresare entirely natural and added, “The misidentification of natural objects as theby-products of ‘intelligent design’ is an important lesson that needs to belearned by many fringe group members.”Others are not as certain as Heinrich of the spheres’ natural origins. RoelfMarx, curator of the Klerksdorp Museum, has stated, “The spheres are a completemystery. They look man-made, yet at the time in Earth’s history when they cameto rest in this rock no intelligent life existed. They’re nothing like I haveever seen before.”Even stranger was the explanation of Douglas James Cottrell, a trance psychicsimilar to the famous Edgar Cayce. During one session, he was asked about theKlerksdorp spheres. He stated that they are “sighting instruments,” similar totape recorders, created by extraterrestrials to pass along information from oneworld to another via subtle energy vibrations. His explanation for such ancientcell phones sounded eerily similar to that of the accounts of Tellinger, Cathie,and Leedskalnin.Other ancient artifacts are equally intriguing. One such was found by authorSitchin in Turkey’s Istanbul Archaeology Museum. The carving, which measuresabout six inches long by four inches wide, was described by Sitchin as “asculpted scale model of what, to modern eyes, looks like a cone-nosedrocket-ship … powered by a cluster of four exhaust engines in the backsurrounding a larger exhaust engine, the rocket-ship has room for a sole pilot,actually shown and included in the sculpture.”A figure described as the pilot was sitting with legs folded toward his chestand appeared to be wearing a one-piece ribbed pressure suit with boots andgloves. As the head is missing, it is impossible to know if the figure wore ahelmet, goggles, or other headgear.The carving was excavated at Toprakkale, a city known in ancient times as Tuspa.Curators had not put the carving on display; they had concluded that it was afake because it differed from other objects of its era and mostly because itresembled a space capsule. Sitchin convinced them to display the artifact andlet the public decide. Most observers do see the figure as a person sitting insome sort of cockpit.Austrian researcher Klaus Dona, who presented a well-received public exhibit atthe Vienna Art Center Schottenstift in 2001, displayed many amazing artifactsthat gave indication that our history is not as we have been taught.A small tool called the Hammer of Texas was one exhibit indicating intelligentlife before that accepted by conventional science. This hammer was made ofalmost pure iron but showed no signs of rusting. It was placed within a woodenhandle and was obviously a manufactured tool. The tool was found encased inlimestone dated to more than 140 million years ago, when no humans were thoughtto exist. Adding to this puzzle are several humanlike handprints and footprintsfound in the same geological stratum with dinosaur tracks. Humans and dinosaursare not supposed to have coexisted, according to conventional science.One of Dona’s most fascinating exhibits was a stone pyramid embedded withprecious stones, including one placed near the top. The artifact eerilyresembled the “all-seeing eye” atop a pyramid that is imprinted on every dollarbill. But this ancient artifact was found in Ecuador.Dona’s many quaint and curious artifacts included statues and carvings ofprehistoric animals thought to have been extinct long before the advent ofhumankind, art depicting strange humanoids wearing helmets, replicas of flyingmachines, and engravings of the planets and stars. Several ancient carvingsdepict saucer-shaped craft and beings with large slanted eyes identical tomodern depictions of alien “grays” as described by persons who claim to haveexperience of them.ELONGATED SKULLS AND THE STARCHILD [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s23]Evidence from the exhibition of Klaus Dona indicating that nonhumans may havelived on Earth in the past included skulls brought from Central and SouthAmerica with features that may not be human.Many such skulls are termed elongated, as they extend up and beyond normal humanlength, similar to the skull of an interdimensional alien depicted in the filmIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Like so many legends andfables, this film may have contained a modicum of truth.Archaeologists, operating under the narrow constraints of science, claim aconventional explanation for the misshapen skulls. They say young Incachildren’s heads were bound so as to produce the elongated effect. A morefar-reaching view is that this was done to emulate their elder creator gods, andit has been noted that the practice was confined to the ruling and religiousclass.But this explanation fails to address other issues. Brien Foerster, author of ABrief History of the Incas, while studying the Paracas culture in Peru, foundone elongated skull with no molar teeth or even sockets for them. The skull alsoexhibited exceptionally large eye sockets and two small identical holes in theback of the skull which could not be explained by the ancient practice oftrepanning. Other skulls exhibited strangeness with the normal three suturelines that connect the parietal, sagittal, and lambda portions of the humanskull. Some had only two lines, while others had four, and one skull wascompletely smooth with no suture lines. Foerster, while remarking on the oddityof the skulls, only hinted that they might represent ancient aliens viewed asgods by the Incas.Researcher and author Lloyd Pye has been more forthright. Pye has spentcountless dollars and many years of his life attempting to determine that hisStarchild, a strange and misshapen skull found last century in Mexico, is not ofhuman origin. The skull, dated to about nine hundred years ago, was found inMexico in the 1930s and subsequently ended up in the hands of Ray and MelanieYoung, who asked Pye to head efforts to identify the origin of the skull. In1999, Pye formed the Starchild Project, an informal group of researchers andscientists, who soon ruled out all known natural deformities and initially foundthat the skull presented a genetic and physical profile never before seen onEarth. X-rays of the teeth indicated the skull belonged to someone about five orsix years old. Yet degradation of the teeth’s enamel indicated the skull wasthat of an adult. X-rays also revealed natural convolutions of the unusuallyflattened back of the skull, proving that it had not been cradleboarded, anexplanation offered by skeptics. Cradleboarding was a common Native Americanpractice of binding a babe to a board on the mother’s back while moving about.Pye and his Starchild team have now documented at least twenty-two physicalabnormalities on the small skull. Such anomalies, unheard of in any one subject,have been brushed off by conventional scientists as mere deformities. Pyecommented:Mainstream science has consistently failed to explain—or even explain away—anyof the Starchild’s anomalies, much less the complex combination that somehowcreated a functioning being. Why? Because science has collectively agreed to setits BS detector to go off if anything passes by it that is not alreadyunderstood or does not fit accepted theories. … Peer pressure is crushingrelative to subjects deemed “off limits” for serious discussion and analysis.Things like UFO’s, aliens, hominoids (bigfoot, etc.), and cold fusion are“forbidden” because their proof would utterly transform “reality” as it istoday. No scientist wants to be on the hot seat when a paradigm overturns, sothey work diligently to keep these various genies corked up in bottles ofignorance and intimidation fueled by their “credentialed” ridicule and disdain.In 1999, Pye asked six laboratories equipped to test ancient DNA to examine theStarchild, but all six demurred, citing the “professional stigma” involved.Finally, DNA tests in 2003 demonstrated that the Starchild’s mother was humanbut its father was less than 100 percent human, as the nuclear DNA was viablebut not recoverable by human testing methods. Further DNA tests on the Starchildlanguished due to the prohibitive costs.Early in 2011, a geneticist identified several fragments of the Starchild skullwhich, while matching human mitochondrial DNA, presented many more nucleotidedifferences than are normally found among humans. Pye said the new DNA findingsindicate that the Starchild skull may well be alien. “Now all that remains is todetermine whether alien means foreign to normal human genetics within theframework of that subject as it is currently understood or definitely not fromplanet Earth … or something in between,” he said.Such determination came later in 2011. One lab, using newly developedtechniques, agreed to test the DNA on the condition that the lab’s name not bemade public. The result was astounding. It was reported that “no significantsimilarity” was found between the Starchild DNA and a genetic database that,though limited, nevertheless contained millions of DNA samples representingthousands of species including humans. This indicated that at least some of theStarchild’s nuclear DNA is not found on Earth.More striking was a study of the Starchild’s mitochondrial DNA in which wasreported a total of ninety-three variations different from human mtDNA. Pyebelieves this high level of variation could mean that the DNA in different partsof Starchild’s skull could differ even further from normal human DNA.In early 2012, a fragment of the Starchild’s skull containing a special proteincalled FOXP2, was shown to exhibit fifty-six variations from the same type ofprotein in humans. “To put this in perspective, let’s imagine that when alive,the Starchild was indeed some unknown humanoid. No matter how different fromhumans it might have been, to be in the humanoid family, its FOXP2 gene wouldhave to be in the range of 1 or 2 or at most 3 base pair variations from anormal human. To go past 5 or 10 would put it into another class of species; 20to 25 would put it in the range of mice and elephants, and dogs and frogs. Tohave 56 is to put it in another realm, another dimension entirely. It is utterlyunique,” said Pye. “This is the real deal,” he added. “We simply lack thefunding to complete a DNA study which we hope will prove the Starchild is nothuman.”Lack of funds and interest also stopped Zecharia Sitchin from conducting a DNAanalysis on the skeleton of Nin Puabi, also called Queen Shubad, a Mesopotamianroyal who was buried at Ur about 4,500 years ago and thought to be related tothe Anunnaki. The queen’s skeletal remains are still in London’s Natural HistoryMuseum. But when Sitchin suggested a DNA study, Margaret Clegg of the museum’sHuman Remains Unit replied, “No DNA analysis has ever been conducted on theseremains … the museum does not routinely conduct DNA analysis on remains in thecollection, and there are no plans to do so in the near future.”Despite the lack of DNA studies and a seeming lack of desire on the part ofarchaeological authorities to test the thesis, evidence continues to pile upindicating an extraterrestrial presence in our solar system and on Earth,lending strong support to the ancient legends of long-lost civilizations andextraterrestrial visitations."},{"pageContent":"SACRED SITES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha05]THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THOUGHT OF AS being strangely advancedfor their time. René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz, a philosopher who studied thetemples at modern Luxor (ancient Thebes) for fifteen years, found that the earlyEgyptians had implemented a mathematical constant called the golden section, orgolden ratio. Though the golden ratio was originally attributed to the Greeks,it seems that at Thebes the Egyptians applied it with great complexity andsophistication. The golden ratio is a mathematical ratio between two componentssuch that the larger is the same proportion of the whole as the smaller is ofthe larger. In art and architecture, it creates an eye-pleasing proportion.Artists, architects, engineers, and others have used it through the years. Thefact that ancient Egyptians used it demonstrates knowledge of mathematics longbefore the Greeks and Pythagoras. What prompted this ancient knowledge andtechnical prowess?THE OSIRION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s24]About fifty miles down the Nile from Thebes, in Abydos, the early capital ofdynastic Egypt, sits the New Kingdom temple of Seti I, where the golden ratiowas applied. The temple is perhaps the finest built during Egypt’s NineteenthDynasty (1298–1197 BC). Behind the temple and far below, an amazing megalithicstructure called the Osirion (sometimes spelled Osireion) protrudes into thedesert. The structure, with its gigantic posts and lintel stone blocks, looksfor all the world like a better-constructed Stonehenge, as its stones are smoothand wonderfully aligned in comparison to the worn and partially collapsedEnglish landmark.The Osirion was discovered in 1902 by the British team of archaeologist WilliamFlinders Petrie and Egyptologist and anthropologist Margaret Alice Murray. Someconventional Egyptologists argued that the Osirion was just another part ofSeti’s temple, but Murray knew better. In a 1903 report, she stated that “we hadfound a building which has no known counterpart in Egypt.” Because a number ofthe cartouches of Merneptah, who succeeded Ramses II, were found at the site,one hypothesis offered up was that the Osirion was the pharaoh’s tomb, despitethe fact that no funerary materials nor body were found. Murray countered thisidea by stating, “There is no tomb even among the Tombs of the Kings that islike it in plan, none having the side chamber leading off the Great Hall. Then,again, no tomb has ever been found attached to a temple; the converse is oftenthe case, I mean a temple attached to a tomb …” Some thought Merneptah hadmerely taken possession of a structure there long before him.“The other hypothesis was that this was the building for the special worship ofOsiris and the celebration of the Mysteries and this appears to me to be thetrue explanation, for many reasons,” Murray wrote. “Each reason may not beconvincing in itself, but the accumulation of evidence goes to prove the case.”As its name suggests, the Osirion may indeed have been built to worship Osiris,the Egyptian god of the underworld, death, and rebirth. According to the ancientmythologies, the Egyptian god Osiris had roughly the same description as theSumerian god Enki.There are several credible arguments against the Osirion being built by earlyEgyptians. Virtually all New Kingdom temples are constructed at ground levelfrom stone blocks weighing no more than two tons, and every available space isfilled with carving, hieroglyphics, or painted walls. Not so the Osirion. Thefloor is located forty feet below present ground level, while the stone blocks,often weighing sixty tons or more, were put into place without mortar, and evena piece of paper cannot be slipped between them. And with the exception of a fewhieroglyphic images, which obviously appear to have been placed there long afterthe structure was built, the exquisitely cut stone walls are bare. Geologistshave found that the layer of earth above the Osirion gives the structure aminimum age of eighteen thousand years.It is worthwhile to note that Abydos was the center of the cult of Osiris, thegod of death and rebirth. Nearly all researchers agree that the Osirion isdedicated to Osiris. Some researchers have noted that the only two structuresfound in Egypt that resemble the Osirion are the Sphinx Temple and the ValleyTemple, both found beside the Sphinx. The two Sphinx temples also display thesame water erosion as the Sphinx itself and therefore must have sat out underheavy rains, which only took place more than ten thousand years ago. Since theyare known to have been built from stone removed from the base of the Sphinxduring its construction, this would mean their construction took place severalthousand years before the arrival of Seti.Yet another hypothesis is that Seti, in constructing his temple, discovered theOsirion and in deference to the god Osiris, actually turned his uncompletedtemple toward the ancient site, thus making it the only temple in Egypt with anL-shaped turn.It is interesting to note that a pyramidal structure with a flattened top orplatform is found at the sacred Mayan site of Chichen Itza in the Mexican stateof Yucatán. It is called the Ossario. In the center of a temple atop the Ossariois an opening that leads to a cave in which was found skeletons and variousornaments, leading some archaeologists to conjecture that this was the home ofthe Mayan high priests, a theory that has come under some dispute. Some believethis structure demonstrated some connection to the energy-generating pyramids ofEgypt and Sumer.According to certain researchers, it is at the Osirion at Abydos where the firstmention was made of the Djed Pillar or Tet Pillar, known as the Pillar ofOsiris. For the Egyptians, the Djed Pillar, depicted as a tall cylindricalobject divided by four parallel bars, represented a source of power as well asthe backbone of Osiris. Controversy continues over whether the Dejd was merely arepresentation or a functional device. Several ancient Egyptian reliefs depictmen holding what appear to be elongated glass objects attached to a Djed Pillaras though to a power source. Interestingly, on at least one of these reliefs,the men holding the device are outlined with double lines as though to indicatethey were being shaken by the power of the Djed.This object of power also may be a metaphysical symbol. As one websiteexplained, “The Djed is the supreme unifying symbol of all polarities,connecting us to the transcendent reality of the whole, the One. It symbolizesthe macro and microcosmic ‘axis.’ As the cosmic axis the Djed is the ‘cylinder,’the column of light linking the Earth to the pole star.”Also within the Osirion, a geometric design of multiple evenly spaced andoverlapping circles known to those interested in “sacred geometry” as the Flowerof Life can be found.It’s interesting that this same design, a flowerlike circle, can be found in thetemples, art, and carvings of cultures all over the world, including Stonehenge,the Masada, China’s Forbidden City, the ancient Bulgarian city of Preslav, Mayanand Incan sites in South America, and even some crop circles.If the Osirion wasn’t in fact created by Seti and the Djed really contained suchincredible power, then it’s possible that an undiscovered yet technologicallyadvanced civilization existed in Egypt long before the rise of the dynasties ofthe Pharaohs and that the Flower of Life was a common motif.According to Egyptologist John Anthony West, “The Greeks themselves acknowledgedthe great fount and source of the wisdom that came later. In other words,civilization has been on a downhill slide since ancient Egypt. In fact, ancientEgypt itself was on a downhill trip from its very beginnings, because, strangelyenough, it reached its absolute peak—the height of its prowess andsophistication—fairly early in the Old Kingdom around 2500 B.C. … and prettymuch everything thereafter was a lesser accomplishment, even the fabuloustemples of the New Kingdom.”Other ancient structures continue to baffle researchers who dare to look beyondtheir conventional textbooks.CARNAC [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s25]Thousands of monolithic stones, including pillars, erected near the coast ofBrittany in northwestern France prior to the arrival of the Celts attest theskills of Neolithic people living there more than 4,000 years ago. Carnac, as itis called, is regarded by locals as a Neolithic cathedral, and it is considereda sacred site by many. Unnoticed until the seventeenth century, Carnac iscomposed of more than three thousand stones spread out in multiple rows. One rowmeasures more than five miles in length. During World War II, Carnac was almostobliterated by the Allies, who thought the pillars were a German defense line.Some of the larger stones weigh more than twenty tons, and their true age ishard to determine. Carnac is a mystery, because no one knows how the buildersmanaged to balance these mighty stones in such shallow ground. After all, teninches below the present ground level lies impenetrable granite. No one knowsfor certain why the ancients went to the trouble to construct Carnac, but oneman has presented compelling evidence that again such a prehistoric site isconnected to the stars.Howard Crowhurst, a longtime Carnac researcher, determined that the builders ofCarnac used sophisticated geometry and mathematics to mark solar and lunareclipses. The pillars also seem to be designed to match ley lines in thatlocation.Philip Coppens wrote that Carnac “involved careful alignments to astronomicalphenomena, but also played with the energies of the Earth—which is likely one ofthe reasons why the stones of Carnac were placed on top of a granite surface.Certain energies were harnessed here, but how and why remains a question thatcan only be answered in the future. What we can say is that the site shows thatthe builders of Carnac—in 4500 B.C.—possessed knowledge with which officialarcheology refuses to credit them.”GÖBEKLI TEPE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s26]Göbekli Tepe is a hilltop complex of megaliths erected on the highest point of amountain ridge about five hundred miles from Istanbul in southeastern Turkey.Hunter-gatherers reportedly used the site for religious purposes some twelvethousand years ago during the Neolithic period. Its discovery in 1964 was themost astonishing archaeological find in modern times, and today it is consideredthe oldest advanced civilization on Earth. Prior to the discovery and dating ofGöbekli Tepe, structures in Malta dating back to 3500 BC were considered themost ancient megalithic site known. The complex consists of twenty roundstructures, most still buried, measuring thirty-three to one hundred feet indiameter. Only four have been excavated to date. Each structure is decoratedwith massive T-shaped limestone pillars.The most extraordinary thing about Göbekli Tepe is the fact that the entirecomplex was buried under sand, not through some natural disaster butintentionally. Much damage has occurred over the centuries due to farming andconstruction by locals who had no idea of the antiquity of the site. With thediscovery of Göbekli Tepe, archaeologists have had to completely revise theirtimetable of history, as it was not thought possible for Neolithic people usingprimitive quarrying tools to build such a complex.Archaeologist Klaus Schmidt of the German Archaeological Institute, who is incharge of the Göbekli Tepe excavation, believes its creators came from fardistant places. The various strata at the site suggest several millennia ofwork, perhaps reaching back to the Mesolithic period. Considering that onlyabout 5 percent of Göbekli Tepe’s total area has been excavated, Schmidt saidthe dig might well continue for another fifty years and still “barely scratchthe surface.”British journalist Sean Thomas, who visited the site, noted, “That earlyNeolithic hunter-gatherers could have built something like Göbekli—isworld-changing. Hitherto, it was presumed that agriculture necessarily precededcivilization, and that complex art, society and architecture depended on thereliable food supplies derived from farming. Göbekli Tepe shows that the oldhunter-gatherer life, at least in this region of Turkey, was far more advancedthan was ever conceived.”But why would so-called primitive people use so much time and energy toconstruct something like Göbekli Tepe and then bury it? After finding humanbones in portions of the complex, Schmidt opined, “Göbekli Tepe is not a houseor a domestic building. Evidence of any domestic use is entirely lacking. Noremains of settled human habitation have been found nearby. That leaves onepurpose: religion. Göbekli Tepe is the oldest temple in the world. And it isn’tjust a temple; I think it is probably a funerary complex.” Schmidt viewed thesite as a place of veneration and perhaps communication with supernaturalentities or domains.Schmidt’s interpretation has been challenged in late 2011. In an articlepublished by Current Anthropology, archaeologist Ted Banning argued that basedon evidence of daily food preparation and flint working, the structures atGöbekli Tepe were living quarters for a large population.Termed by some the Turkish Stonehenge, the Göbekli Tepe complex predates itsmore famous British namesake by seven thousand years. Hassan Karabulut,associate curator of the nearby Urfa Museum, has called Göbekli Tepe “one of themost important monuments in the world.” Some have even claimed the site may havebeen the basis for the Bible’s Garden of Eden. One factor leading to this beliefis the number of pillars there covered with elaborate animal figure reliefs.Archaeologists also have found a statue of a human and sculptures of a vulture’shead and a boar. Reptiles and vultures are commonly depicted. Most of thesecarvings are found on the older pillars.As in Egypt, the older columns at Göbekli Tepe are oddly more elaborate andfinely detailed than the later ones, evincing a deterioration of the culture.After visiting Göbekli Tepe in 2008, Andrew Curry, a reporter for Smithsonianmagazine, wrote, “Predating Stonehenge by 6,000 years, Turkey’s stunning GöbekliTepe upends the conventional view of the rise of civilization. … What was soimportant to these early people that they gathered to build (and bury) the stonerings? The gulf that separates us from Göbekli Tepe’s builders is almostunimaginable. Indeed, though I stood among the looming megaliths eager to takein their meaning, they didn’t speak to me. They were utterly foreign, placedthere by people who saw the world in a way I will never comprehend. There are nosources to explain what the symbols might mean. Schmidt agrees, ‘We’re 6,000years before the invention of writing here.’ ”A series of complete circles have been located buried within the Göbekli Tepecomplex reminiscent of reports by Michael Tellinger of the stone circles inSouth Africa. “As we walk around the recently excavated pillars, the site seemsat once familiar and exotic. I have seen stone circles before, but none likethese,” commented Sandra Scham, a fellow of the American Association for theAdvancement of Science. She added, “Scholars thought that the earliestmonumental architecture was possible only after agriculture provided Neolithicpeople with food surpluses, freeing them from a constant focus on day-to-daysurvival. A site of unbelievable artistry and intricate detail, Göbekli Tepe hasturned this theory on its head.”British author and explorer Andrew Collins stated, “There is no obviousexplanation for a high culture existing in Upper Mesopotamia at the end of thelast Ice Age, when the rest of the world was still populated by hunter-gatheringcommunities concerned with day-to-day survival, and little more. However, thesefaceless individuals, known to archaeologists as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN)peoples, created some of the most mesmeric art in the ancient world, which wouldnot be bettered for thousands of years.”Collins pointed out that the similarities between this account of Göbekli Tepe’sformation and the mythology from the Book of Enoch are striking.It is my belief that the trafficking between the suspected ruling elite and thepeoples of Upper Mesopotamia is the story found in the Book of Enoch, wherebeings called Watchers are said to have gone amongst mortal kind giving them theforbidden arts and sciences of heaven. These were said to have included the useof herbs and plants, metallurgy, the fashioning of weapons, femalebeautification, and astronomy, many of the firsts accredited to the EarlyNeolithic world in Upper Mesopotamia.Similar stories exist in the myths and legends of Sumeria, which speak of godscalled Anunnaki coming among mortal kind and providing them with the rudimentsof civilization. I believe there is strong evidence to suggest that theWatchers, and their offspring the Nephilim, were indeed the shamanic elite thatfounded the early Neolithic cult centres of Upper Mesopotamia. They arerepeatedly referred to in pseudepigraphical literature as birdmen, and we knowthat the Neolithic period’s highly prominent cult of the dead was focused aroundexcarnation, and the use of the vulture as a symbol of both astral flight andthe transmigration of the soul in death. Clear carvings and depictions ofvultures, as well as representations of birdmen, have been found at Göbekli Tepeand other PPN sites in SE Turkey and North Syria.Klaus Schmidt agreed that the T-shaped pillars of Göbekli Tepe may representmythical creatures or even ancient gods. Such speculation supports the Sumeriantablets, which state that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving werebrought to mankind by ancient Sumerian deities. Göbekli Tepe sits at the heartof places from biblical mythology, and many nearby locations are clearlymentioned in Genesis. Turkey borders northern Iraq, placing it in proximity tothe source of the Mesopotamian legends of the Anunnaki, visitors who came fromthe heavens. The Turkish town Sanliurfa, which is close to Göbekli Tepe, wasonce known as the city of Ur Kaśdim. Some believe it may be mentioned in the OldTestament as the hometown of the patriarch Abraham.It is fascinating to note that Göbekli Tepe was not lost in the sands of time,but deliberately buried, hidden from succeeding generations. But buried by whomand why? No one knows. And if Klaus Schmidt is correct in believing that thebuilders of Göbekli Tepe came from elsewhere, where could that have been? Theycould not have come from the world’s oldest known civilization, Sumer, as thatculture has been dated back only to 3300 BC, more than six thousand years toolate to have built Göbekli Tepe.Researcher and author Wayne Herschel stated, “Göbekli Tepe’s layout plan andeven its builders’ motives are decoded. They had the same secret knowledge …hidden records of their star ancestors matching the same blueprint secretknowledge of a star of their ancestors like the empires of ancient Egypt, theMaya, the Inca and at Stonehenge.” As with structures in ancient Egypt and evencarvings of the Dogon tribe in Africa, Herschel found that the layout of GöbekliTepe is a match for the star systems of Orion and the Pleiades.Strangely enough, the carvings and depictions of bird-headed figures at GöbekliTepe are also depicted in carvings on the mysterious buried statues on EasterIsland in the Pacific. Herschel found more amazing similarities between the twosites. “The thin arms art style [of Easter Island] is exactly like the …unearthed megaliths at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey. This alone speaks volumes and ifthis isn’t convincing enough, the two large symbols on the back of the Moai[Easter Island head statues] are of the same theme and style too,” he notedafter visiting the island.Herschel found it odd that the statues on Easter Island, which was originallycalled Rapa Nui, were excavated in 1915 but then reburied. “What could have beenso shocking for them to have been completely covered up again?” After comparingmuch evidence at Easter Island with other ancient cultures, Herschel concluded,“Scholars hate this obvious but impossible-to-avoid theory and its simple …[sentence incomplete in source] Almost all ancient civilisations carry the samestar visitor claim … show celestial ships and mostly bird head deities … builtunique megalith structures … [and] show pieces of the same star map.“All ancient civilizations had exactly the same obsession with star visitors …people who are most likely our ancestors returning to try and teach us who weare and where we come from. But what did our people do … they worshipped them asGods.”BAALBEK [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s27]Herschel’s theories are astounding because they force us to reconsider ourhistory in a new way. Did our ancestors descend from the heavens? How close tothe truth was Herschel?Years of war and terrorism have kept tourists away from the ancient ruins atBaalbek in Lebanon. The site was once known as the Roman city of Heliopolis andis one of the largest and best-preserved Roman ruins. Baalbek may also presentsome of the most significant evidence of prehistoric space flight.While attention has been directed mostly to the wondrous Roman towers andcolumns, the puzzling aspect of Baalbek concerns the massive, multi-ton stoneblock undergirding the Baalbek acropolis, larger than the one that is the siteof the Parthenon in Athens. Below the Roman Temple of Jupiter, a wonder initself, lies a wall of some two dozen stone blocks, each weighing 300 tons. Inone corner are three massive blocks, known as the trilithon, each more thansixty-two feet long and weighing an estimated 800 tons. Nearby is yet anotherstone block almost eighty feet in length and weighing 1,100 tons. A formercurator at Baalbek, Michel Alouf, said of these blocks, “In spite of theirimmense size, they are so accurately placed in position and so carefully joined,that it is almost impossible to insert a needle between them. No descriptionwill give an exact idea of the bewildering and stupefying effect of thesetremendous blocks on the spectator.”Since it has become apparent that the gigantic stone blocks under Baalbek farpredate Roman Heliopolis, the question arises of how could a primitive peoplemove such weight? Conventional authorities have suggested the blocks were allmoved with wooden rollers. Some have even demonstrated how this might be done.Steel rollers—it seems more than eight hundred tons will crush woodenrollers—and levers have been used to move a five-thousand- to six-thousand-poundstone on a concrete platform. Other researchers, straining to find anexplanation, announced that they could move stone blocks by flipping them. Theyfirst pried up a two-and-a-half-ton block and placed shims under it. Byrepeating the process, they could flip stones up to about three fourths of a tonwith only four or five men. In 1996, author Alan F. Alford asked representativesof Baldwins Industrial Services, a leading construction company, if they couldmove the thousand-ton Baalbek stone and place it at the same height as thetrilithon.“Although it is sometimes claimed that modern cranes cannot lift stones as heavyas 800 tons, this is actually incorrect,” Alford discovered. “Bob MacGrain, thetechnical director of Baldwins, confirmed that there were several mobile cranesthat could lift and place the 1,000-ton stone on a support structure 20 feethigh. … Unfortunately, however, these cranes do not have the capability toactually move whilst carrying such heavy loads.” Such a crane, fitted withcrawler tracks, would require massive ground preparation to move such a block,including a level and sturdy roadway.After hearing other plausible explanations as to how Baldwins might achieve themovement and placement of such a massive stone block, Alford noted, “This is allvery interesting, and gives us some feel for the scale of the engineeringchallenge, but there is, of course, one slight problem with the Baldwinsscenario, namely that none of this twentieth century technology was supposedlyavailable when Baalbek was built.”Noting that not one Roman emperor ever claimed credit for the Baalbek templecomplex or for the construction of its massive foundations, Alford said, “Whatwe do find instead are legends which suggest that Baalbek was built bysuper-human powers in an epoch long before human civilization began.”According to local legend, Baalbek was once ruled by the legendary Nimrod, thatSumerian ruler who led the attack on the gods by building the fabled Tower ofBabel. Nimrod was said to have been the great-grandson of Utnapishtim, Sumerianequivalent of the Biblical Noah. This suggests a sacred aspect to Baalbek.Searching for perhaps a religious meaning in the artifacts at Baalbek, Alfordsuggested that “the Roman gods are only part of the answer to the sanctity ofBaalbek, for the town was in fact named after Baal, the Storm-God of theCanaanites/Phoenicians. And the legends of the god Baal provide numerousfascinating parallels to the gods of the ancient Mesopotamian exploded planetcults. … Indeed, my own private research suggests that the Canaanite/Phoenicianreligion could itself be described as an exploded planet cult.”Matest Agrest, a Russian-born ethnologist and mathematician, once proposed thatthe giant stone foundation at Baalbek was at one time used as a launch site forspace vehicles and that the destruction of the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah wascaused by a nuclear blast. Agrest, who in 1970 became head of LeningradUniversity’s laboratory and in the early 1990s immigrated to the United States,came to believe that the monuments of early cultures resulted from contact withextraterrestrials.Zecharia Sitchin, in his copious works concerning ancient Sumerian texts, alsoasserted that the massive stones of Baalbek constituted an antediluvian landingpad for the shuttle craft of ancient astronauts. Could its builders have beenancient astronauts, or might they have been from some prehistoric civilization?And Baalbek is not the sole site of massive stone blocks whose size and weightwould seem to be beyond the ability of primitive people to move and lift. Themegalithic ruins of Tiahuanaco lie twelve miles south of Lake Titicaca inwestern Bolivia. Amazingly, the immense stones are joined with modular fittingsand complex breach-locking levels not found in any other ancient culture. Manyof these blocks are joined together with T-shaped metal clamps that were pouredinto place from a portable forge. Some of these blocks weigh between 100 and 150tons. One stone weighs about 800 tons!Known variously as the Baalbek of the New World or an American Stonehenge,Tiahuanaco’s huge stoneworks are considered by some to be the oldest ruins inthe world. In fact, the recent discovery of underwater structures indicates thatTiahuanaco was built, not as a port on the lake, but prior to Lake Titicaca’sexistence. Legends in the area say that the city was a gift of the ancient skygods but was drowned in a flood long ago. It is also said that at the time thatTiahuanaco flourished, the moon was not in its present orbit.Near Tiahuanaco are ruins known as the Puma Punku, which is strewn with giant,precisely shaped blocks, many of which appear machine-made. The stones, composedof granite and diorite, are harder than any other material except diamonds. Theruins at both Tiahuanaco and Puma Punku lie scattered about as if destroyed by acatastrophic event.PYRAMID POWER [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s28]Structures throughout the world give evidence of ancient man’s fixation on theheavens and his fascination with harnessing the powers of the Earth, none moreso than the Great Pyramid of Egypt—the only survivor of the original SevenWonders of the Ancient World. Mysteries and questions abound regarding thispyramid, even as to who constructed it.Many geologists now agree that water erosion on the Great Pyramid and the Sphinxindicates that both structures sat under heavy rains, which have not occurred onthe Giza Plateau for more than ten thousand years. In other words, the Egyptiancivilization, which is dated to the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period ofKing Menes about 3100 BC, could not have built the Great Pyramid. It had to havebeen created much earlier.Though characterized as a burial place for the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Cheops(alternately called Khufu), no hieroglyphics adorn the walls of the GreatPyramid, unlike every other ancient Egyptian structure. Furthermore, no evidenceof a burial has been found, except one cartouche, which has been called intoquestion as a possible modern addition, reportedly found in 1837 by BritishEgyptologist Colonel Howard Vyse, who was haunted by suspicions of fabricationsas he was desperately in need of justification for his Egyptian expeditionexpenditures.After viewing evidence from German robotics engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink, Britishengineer Christopher Dunn believes that the Great Pyramid might be a giant powergenerator based on harmonic resonance. In 1993, Gantenbrink sent aremote-controlled robot named Upuaut II (Upuaut, or Wepwawet, was a deity whosename means Opener of the Ways, probably in the sense of Scout) to explore thesouthern shaft in the Queen’s Chamber. The robot traveled up the shaft andrevealed what Dunn interpreted as electrical terminals, cables, and even ancientwiring diagrams etched on the walls.“The discovery of electrical contacts and wiring inside the Great Pyramid, alongwith markings that show how to connect them, do not fit anywhere in conventionalEgyptology but confirm the theory first published in my book, The Giza PowerPlant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt, in 1998,” said Dunn. In his book, Dunnproposed that the Queen’s Chamber “served as a reaction chamber and the shaftsleading to this chamber supplied two chemicals that when mixed together createdhydrogen.” Dunn has pointed out that at the end of the pyramid’s southern shaft,in what is now known as Gantenbrink’s door, there are two metal pins.While the metal pins have been described as ornaments or door handles by some,no one has explained why ornamental metal pins would have been placed out ofsight in small shafts within the pyramid. It is possible that they are actuallyelectrodes.In May 2011, New Scientist magazine published new images of these shafts,including a stone block in one—possibly a door—near the outside of the pyramid.The two small shafts have been described as “the last great mystery of thepyramid” by Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s former minister of state for antiquitiesaffairs. The latest exploration also revealed abnormal hieroglyphs in red paintand odd carvings thought to be marks made by the original builders. “If thesehieroglyphs could be deciphered they could help Egyptologists work out why thesemysterious shafts were built,” said Rob Richardson of the University of Leeds.Christopher Dunn has produced a compelling argument that the Great Pyramid, farfrom being simply a tomb, was instead a giant power source.There was no immediate explanation for what these red symbols mean, but they area significant discovery and have the potential to open up an entirely new areaof research in gaining an understanding of ancient Egyptian symbolism. Whenconsidered along with the metal pins the symbols provide all the evidencenecessary to prove the electrical use of the pins and also give us a roadmap forexploration into the future. Not only did the ancient Egyptians leave us withthe physical evidence that proves this to be so, they also provided us with anelectrical schematic that showed how the pins were wired!COSMIC WAR [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s29]Joseph P. Farrell also believes the pyramids were power sources, and he has eventaken Dunn’s conclusions a step further. In a series of books, Farrellpostulated that in the remote past, the power of the Great Pyramid was used as aweapon in a great cosmic war that encompassed our entire solar system. Aftercalling attention to a huge gouge on Mars, Farrell stated, “Certainly impactsfrom comets and meteors have occurred and can wreak untold destruction on theplanetary bodies that endure them. But so can wars fought with weapons ofsufficient power to scar whole regions. …”Farrell’s thesis received strong support in 2011 with the publication of Lifeand Death on Mars by John Brandenburg, senior propulsion scientist at theOrbital Technologies Corporation and one of the early researchers on the Cydoniaproject, a private study of the strange monuments on Mars. Brandenburg statesthat Mars was actually earthlike for most of its geologic history. It containeda massive and evolving biosphere but experienced a mysterious and astonishingnuclear catastrophe.Hoagland also saw the asteroid belt as an exploded planet, a notion entertainedby many. “What mechanism can explain why planets should suddenly explode? Theproblem is not a small one, nor will it go away,” said Hoagland.Farrell’s scenario is not as implausible as it may sound on the surface. Thenotable astronomer Tom Van Flandern, referring to the possibility of an explodedplanet, stated, “This speculative possibility might result from magneticseparation and storage of the antimatter in a planet over billions of yearsbefore the explosion; or from some sort of chain-reaction high-energy antimattergeneration process; or from the intervention of intelligent beings. In myopinion, the last possibility should not be dismissed out of hand.” Farrellnoted, “Van Flandern is gingerly and delicately implying that his explodedplanets might have been blown up in deliberate acts of war. Yet … it isprecisely this model that the abundance of ancient texts actually supports!”After listing the previously mentioned strange formations on the moon, Mars, andelsewhere, Farrell has stated that these anomalies are “very real, veryartificial structures that are no mere metaphors. This implies, howeverunbelievable it may seem, that the war was also real, that it wasinterplanetary, and that it happened millennia ago.”Farrell went on to theorize that this war devastated the Earth, reducing thepopulation to a primitive state, produced bomb craters on the moon, and leftMars a desolated world. A small group survived, according to Farrell, andthroughout our history has attempted to manipulate humanity into re-creating thesuper science of this former age so that this remnant can dominate and subjugatethe Earth. Again he is supported by Brandenburg, who wrote that in the distantpast, survivors on Mars fled to Earth and that we are the “children of Mars,”both culturally and biologically.PYRAMIDS AS STAR MAPS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s30]Symbologist Wayne Herschel believes that the Great Pyramid, among othermonuments, provides a map to the stars. Proceeding from the conclusions ofRobert Bauval and Adrian Gilbert’s 1994 work, The Orion Mystery, Herschelbelieves that the Giza Plateau pyramids reflected the constellation Orion, whichwas said to be the home of reborn pharaohs. Bauval had determined that theconfiguration of the three Giza pyramids—two in line while the third isoffset—indeed matched the configuration of Orion’s stars and that a small tunnelor air shaft inside the Great Pyramid aligned with the star cluster of Orion’sbelt. Shockingly, Bauval and Gilbert realized that the arrangement of the Gizapyramids reflected the position of Orion as it would have appeared about theyear 10,450 BC—a date that is consistent with the growing body of evidencesuggesting that the Great Pyramid was built thousands of years before weoriginally thought.In his graphics-laden 2003 book, The Hidden Records, Herschel presented sevenyears of research, which showed that a wide variety of pyramids, temples, andancient texts worldwide all represented maps of the stars that served as theoriginal homes of our progenitors. Studying a number of primary sources,including fifty star maps found around the world, Herschel concluded that the“gods” of early humans originated from other solar systems and their sun wasdepicted on star maps left on Earth.British author Colin Andrews has offered an alternate explanation for Bauval,Gilbert, and Herschel’s pyramid configurations. Andrews has argued that whilethe three Giza pyramids do resemble Orion’s Belt, they don’t match it exactly.However, the constellation Cygnus does precisely match the Giza Plateau’slayout. In fact, every star of the Cygnus constellation matched an Egyptianstructure on the overlay map, except for the star Deneb. He speculated thatsomething heretofore unknown must be at that location.Supporting each of these researchers’ hypotheses, a new tomb with anine-foot-long sarcophagus was discovered in Egypt in 1999, considered byEgyptian antiquities minister Zahi Hawass to be the “symbolic” tomb of theancient god Osiris. “It is at least interesting that the tomb of Osiris waslocated directly under where the star Deneb … strikes the Giza Plateau,” notedUFO radio commentator Kevin Smith. “It is interesting because it ratherindicates that the fact that the Giza Plateau and the constellation Cygnus matchis not an accident. Not only does the constellation Cygnus match the layout ofthe pyramids, but it marks the precise spot where Osiris’ tomb lay deep underthe ground.”Though the discovery of Osiris’s tomb was an incredible find, Smith noted thatthere was something odd about its retrieval. There are numerous photos showingthe workers lifting the sarcophagus from its resting place in the tomb’s lowerpit to the workers’ level. In addition, there are photos of the workerspreparing to lift the sarcophagus’s lid. Yet oddly enough, there isn’t a singlereleased photo showing the inside of the sarcophagus at the instant when the lidwas removed.Smith noted that Hawass later said the sarcophagus was empty when the lid cameoff. “But was it?” he asked. “This is not to imply that Hawass was lying, but itdoes seem more than odd that there are photos of all the work leading up totaking the lid off the sarcophagus, but no concurrent photo of what was seeninside the instant the lid came off.” Smith believes that what Hawass may havebeen covering up was that the mummy of Osiris was inside. If so, this would meanthat Osiris was in fact an extraterrestrial—after all.In addition to Colin Andrews, conventional academia also rejected the idea thatthe three pyramids at Giza fully align with the three stars of Orion’s Beltbecause the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx do not match up with every star in theOrion constellation. Wayne Herschel believes there is an explanation for this,however—that the ancient Egyptians intended to encompass much more than just thesystem of Orion. Near the pyramids are piles of ruins that may have beenpyramids long ago. With these ruins, Herschel devised a match between pyramidsat not only Giza but also at Abu Rawash, Zawyet el-Aryan, and Abusir with thestar systems of Sirius, Aldebaran, the Pleiades, and Orion, including Rigel andBetelgeuse. He explained that the ruin to the south of the Sphinx had beenslightly offset to avoid protruding into the Nile. Other than that, thepositions of the pyramids were a perfect representation of the star systems.“It can be said with a certain amount of finality that all the pyramid star mapsyou have evidenced around the globe and even on another planet—Mars—marked thestart of something utterly monumental in our solar system. They were probablybuilt in celebration of the epoch of the genesis of the human species in oursolar system … as an ‘arrival’ scenario from the ‘ak,’ the star of the ‘gods’[emphasis in the original],” wrote Herschel, explaining that Ak is the name ofthe sun from which the sun god Ra originated.He elaborated: “The ancient Egyptians revered a Sun … but it was not our Sun!Astronomers can confirm that the Solar Temple obelisk is the only monument inthe entire pyramid field to emulate a ‘Sun-like’ star … and it is relativelynearby. The correlation occurred only at its most precise position 17,250 yearsago, perhaps documenting the dawning of humanity. All the other pyramids matchbright stars that are nothing like our Sun.” Herschel suggests that the SunTemple was named after a sunlike star (HD 283271 in the Pleiades) and hasnothing to do with Sol, our sun, at all.FORGOTTEN PYRAMIDS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s31]Other pyramids also have generated controversy. An ongoing dispute was generatedin late 2005 when it was announced that the world’s largest pyramid had beenfound near the town of Visoko (literally, High), northwest of the Bosnian cityof Sarajevo. Semir “Sam” Osmanagić, a Houston, Texas, manufacturer who was bornin Bosnia and a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences inMoscow, said he first found two pyramids earlier in 2005 when he noticed thatwhat had been thought to be merely hills had triangular faces and obvious edges.After his creation of the nonprofit Archaeological Park: Bosnian Pyramid of theSun Foundation, Osmanagić said a team of international scientists found fivepyramids at the site, the largest of them rising 722 feet, which makes it higherthan the Great Pyramid, which is 481 feet tall. He also said radiocarbon datingconducted by the Institute of Physics of the Silesian Institute of Technology inGliwice, Poland, indicated the pyramid was constructed more than ten thousandyears ago, making it the oldest pyramid in the world by conventional standards.This date could mean its construction was contemporary with what some peoplebelieve was the construction of the Great Pyramid. Most astonishing of all wereOsmanagić's further claims:A team of physicists detected an energy beam coming through the top of theBosnian Pyramid of the Sun. The radius of the beam is 4.5 meters with afrequency of 28 kHz [kilohertz]. The beam is continuous and its strength growsas it moves up and away from the pyramid. This phenomenon contradicts the knownlaws of physics and technology. This is the first proof of non-herziantechnology on the planet. It seems that the pyramid-builders created a perpetualmotion machine a long time ago and this “energy machine” is still working.Almost everything they teach us about the ancient history is wrong: origin ofmen, civilizations and pyramids. Homo sapiens is not a result of evolution andbiologists will never find a “missing link,” because intelligent man is theproduct of genetic engineering. Sumerians are not the beginning of the civilizedmen, but rather the beginning of another cycle of humanity. And finally,original pyramids, most superior and oldest, were made by advanced builders whoknew energy, astronomy and construction better than we do.Mainstream scientists were quick to deny anything unusual about the mounds inBosnia, describing them merely as natural geologic formations—hills. AnthonyHarding, president of the European Association of Archaeologists and holder ofthe anniversary chair in archaeology at Exeter University in England, wasencouraged to verify the find. “Since such claims obviously belonged to afantasy world, I was inclined to ignore the affair, … ” he later wrote. “Icalled in at the hill of Visocica, on the edge of the town of Visoko, and lookedat the excavation trenches that had been opened. We did this solely in order toavoid the charge, already laid at our door, that we had condemned the projectwithout seeing it for ourselves. As we expected, we saw areas of natural stone(a breccia), with fissures and cracks; but no sign of anything that looked likearchaeology,” said Harding. However, he and other scoffers failed to explain theaccounts and photos of Osmanagić and others depicting tunnels and chamberswithin this “natural geologic formation.”“Mainstream scientists, archaeologists, historians and anthropologists, areoften the main obstacle for scientific progress,” argued Osmanagić. And thecontroversy continued.Yet there is another non-Egyptian pyramid, dated to more than ten thousand yearsago by scientists in China, found in the western province of Qinghai. It hasbeen compared to pyramids photographed on Mars. The Xianyang pyramid risesalmost two hundred feet above the surrounding countryside and has a flat topthought by some to accommodate landing craft. “Local villagers claim theirdistant ancestors spoke of great sky ships that navigated the heavens and usedthe pyramid as a landing, refueling and resupply site. The hypothesis regardingextra-terrestrials is ‘understandable and worth looking into’ Yang Ji, one ofthe scientists and a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,explained to reporters,” wrote retired major George Filer of the National UFOCenter, which published photos of the pyramid and strange pipelike tubes foundthere.According to a Chinese news agency report, the pyramid has three caves withopenings shaped like triangles on its facade and is filled with red-hued pipesleading into the mountain and the nearby saltwater lake. Above the caves aredozens of pipes of various diameters running into the mountainside beneath thetowering pyramid. Filer suggested that the pipes, more than simply carryingwater, may have been used to channel and transport energy from the earth.The Toltec Mounds near Scott, Arkansas, are similar to the mysterious Indianmounds in Ohio and have been compared to the Egyptian pyramids by the state’sDepartment of Parks and Tourism. One of the largest and most complex sites inthe Lower Mississippi Valley, the numerous Toltec Mounds have been a NationalHistoric Landmark since 1978. They are thought to have been built by the PlumBayou culture as early as AD 700. According to state literature, “The moundlocations were apparently planned using principles based on alignment withimportant solar positions. … This alignment can still be witnessed at the siteon the spring and fall equinoxes.”Another large North American pyramid is located near St. Louis. Called the Cityof Cahokia, the pyramid and surrounding mounds are described as one of thegreatest cities of the world, for in AD 1250 it was home to more people thanLondon at that time. Built by Native Americans along the Mississippi, itscreators were craftsmen who erected palisaded villages, a wide variety ofstructures, and a social hierarchy led by the Great Sun."},{"pageContent":"PART II [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt02]THE ANCIENTS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt02]“De t’ings dat yo’ li’ble / To read in de Bible, / It ain’t necessarily so.”—“IT AIN’T NECESSARILY SO,” PORGY AND BESS, LYRICS BY IRA GERSHWIN FROM THE GEOLOGICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA, IT WOULD seem that Earth has beenhome to several civilizations—human or otherwise—long before recorded history.In a book little known in America entitled Gods of the New Millennium:Scientific Proof of Flesh & Blood Gods, British author Alan F. Alford wrote, “Ashadowy pre-history seems to exist as a legacy in the form of stone, maps andmythology, which our 20th century technology has only just allowed us torecognize.”Scholars have always faced at least two choices in dealing with ancient textsand legends—to either assume that the texts are allegorical fantasy or to takethem literally. For too long, they wrote off the old stories as fables. But inthe modern world, with recent advances in geology, archaeology, and evenspaceflight, a whole new view of our past is taking shape, one that tiestogether the stories of our path to reveal an underlying truth about ourheritage.It was once thought that the Greek poet Homer’s account of the Trojan War wassheer fiction until Troy’s ruins were located by Charles Maclaren in 1822. Eventhen, it was not until the extensive excavations of Heinrich Schliemann in 1870that the reality of Troy was accepted. Likewise, the ancient Mesopotamian cityof Ur was thought to be largely myth until it was discovered and excavated byLeonard Woolley following World War I.Much of the Bible simply recasts narratives from ancient Sumer, which, forexample, include a nearly identical account of the Great Flood. Sumerian culturewas the wellspring for much of ancient Middle Eastern mythology.The very foundation of Egyptian culture may well have been passed down byimmigrants from devastated lands of Sumer. One of these later migrants was theBiblical patriarch Abraham, a ranking Sumerian who came from the city of Ur toEgypt with the “Tables of Destiny.” These objects were thought by many to be theoriginal “tables of testimony” mentioned in Exodus 31:18. According togenealogical expert and author Laurence Gardner, the name Abraham actually was atitle (like the name David) and could have referred to any number of persons.Ab-ram—or Av-ram—which means “exalted father” in Hebrew, can also be translatedas “he who possesses Ram,” an expression used in India, Tibet, Egypt, and in theCeltic world to denote a high degree of universal knowledge.Abraham crossed the whole of the Near East and built an army, all the whileguided by his god, who had provided weapons that allowed him to defeat muchlarger forces. Abraham arrived in Egypt carrying the wisdom of Sumer in cleverlyworded codes found within the Torah and other old Hebraic texts such as theSefer Yezirah (Book of Creation), the Sefer ha-Zohar (Book of Light), and the HaQabala.Paracelsus, the Swiss-German Renaissance alchemist who reflected his family’sknowledge of Greco-Roman history, gave an account of how Adam predicted thedestruction of the world by water and how his successors engraved ancientknowledge on two tablets of stone, which were found by Noah following the GreatFlood. “At length this universal knowledge was divided into several parts, andlessened in its vigor and power,” wrote Paracelsus. “Abraham … a consummateastrologer and arithmetician, carried the Ark [containing the tablets] out ofthe land of Canaan into Egypt, whereupon the Egyptians rose to so great a heightand dignity that this wisdom was derived from them by other nations.”Evidence of flooding around the world lends credence to tales of the GreatFlood. The same time frame encompassing the flood is also cited as the time thatfabled Atlantis sank into the waters.WHERE WAS ATLANTIS? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s32]Our planet looked much different 250 million years ago. Instead of a world ofseven distinct continents, Earth was two things—a mass of ocean and a mass ofland. This giant landmass was a supercontinent called Pangaea. But someresearchers believe Pangaea was not the first, and that other supercontinentshad existed before Pangaea but simply broke apart and then recombined.There are also many tales of fabulous cities, nations, and cultures lost tocataclysm. Mu, Lemuria, Agartha, Thule, Shambhala, Shangri-La, and Cibola arejust a few of the names tossed out referring to ancient lost civilizations.But the most famous of these is Atlantis, a name revered by students of themetaphysical and reviled by those predisposed to conventional science. The twomen most connected to the legend of Atlantis are the Greek philosopher Plato, astudent of Socrates who lived four hundred years before Christ, and IgnatiusDonnelly, a populist congressman and a student of catastrophism in general andAtlantis in particular.The story of Atlantis has continued to fire the imagination for centuries. SirFrancis Bacon, a leading member of England’s Invisible College, which claimedaccess to the “Underground Stream of Knowledge,” referred to newly found Americaas the New Atlantis. In recent years, theorists have devised all sorts ofhypotheses as to how Atlantis came to be and where it ended up, but the famousphilosopher Plato was the first to introduce the concept of the lost city. Heclaimed to have obtained his knowledge passed down through his family from hisancestor Solon, who in turn had obtained it while living in Egypt. In thedialogue Timaeus in 360 BC, Plato wrote of a great war between ancient Greeksand Atlantis, “a mighty power” spanning the globe “which was aggressing wantonlyagainst the whole of Europe and Asia. …”This power had landed on the Atlantic coast, for in those days the Atlantic wasnavigable from an island situated to the west of the straits which you callPillars of Hercules: the island was larger than Libya and Asia [Asia meaning theMiddle East] put together, and from it could be reached other islands, and fromthe islands you might pass through to the opposite continent, which surroundedthe true ocean; for this sea which is within the columns of Hercules is only aharbour, having a narrow entrance, but that other is a real sea, and thesurrounding land may be most truly called a continent. Now, the island wascalled Atlantis and was the heart of a great and wonderful empire, which hadrule over the whole island and several others, as well as over parts of thecontinent; and besides these, they subjected the parts of Libya as far as Egyptand of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia [an ancient kingdom centered in the Alps aboveItaly]. … But afterward there occurred violent earthquakes and floods, and in asingle day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth,and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared beneath the sea. And thatis the reason why the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable, becausethere is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way; and this was caused by thesubsidence of the island.Notice that Plato referred to a continent opposite Africa and Europe. This isclear evidence that the American continents were known as far back as Plato’stime, four centuries before the birth of Jesus and way before conventionalhistory has stated that they were discovered by Leif Eriksson and ChristopherColumbus.How did Atlantis come to be? Plato, writing through the words of Critias,offered this explanation, “I have before remarked in speaking of the allotmentsof the gods, that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing inextent, and made for themselves temples and instituted sacrifices. And Poseidon[comparable to the Anunnaki Enki, known as the lord of waters], receiving forhis lot the island of Atlantis, begat children by a mortal woman, and settledthem in a part of the island, which I will describe.”While most people today still consider Atlantis a myth, others, includingnineteenth-century American congressman Ignatius Donnelly, took Plato’s words as“veritable history,” claiming Atlantis was the place where humankind first rosefrom barbarism to civilization. Donnelly considered that the “gods and goddessesof the ancient Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Hindus, and the Scandinavians weresimply the kings, queens, and heroes of Atlantis, and the acts attributed tothem in mythology, a confused recollection of real historical events.” He alsosaid Egypt was the oldest colony of Atlantis and its civilization, which alongwith that of the Mayans of Central America represented a primitive reproductionof the Atlantean culture. Both in Atlantis and in Central and South America,gold was extensively mined and treasured, not for any intrinsic value, but forits association with elder “gods.”But many even today dismiss Atlantis as mere myth and legend sparked by Plato’swritings. Apparently, they failed to notice that many authors of classicalliterature, such as Proclus, Diodorus, Plutarch, Posidonius, Strabo, and Pliny,all made references to Atlantis.In recent years, a variety of other theories as to the location of Atlantis havebeen advanced. Based on Plato’s description, and assuming the “Pillars ofHeracles” refers to the Strait of Gibraltar, most researchers believe Atlantiswas located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean between Africa and the Americas.In the 1920s, the “sleeping prophet,” Edgar Cayce, saw Atlantis as acontinent-size region extending from the Azores to the Bahamas, with ships andaircraft powered by a mysterious form of energy crystal. Cayce predicted thatportions of Atlantis would be found in modern times.In 2010, geologists working with seismic data collected by oil companiesdiscovered buried deep beneath the sediment of the North Atlantic Ocean west ofthe Orkney and Shetland islands an ancient landscape with furrows cut by riversand mountain peaks. Researchers traced eight major rivers and took core samplesfrom the rock beneath the ocean floor, which revealed pollen and coal, evidenceof land-dwelling life.“It looks for all the world like a map of a bit of a country onshore,” saidNicky White, the senior researcher. The submerged landscape, described as“reminiscent of the mythical lost Atlantis,” covers about 3,861 square miles,could have held a population of tens of thousands, and may be part of a largerregion that merged with present-day Scotland and may have extended toward Norwayin a world before recorded history.THE BIMINI ROAD [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s33]It was in 1969, within prophet Cayce’s predicted time frame, that researchersRobert Ferro and Michael Grumley set out from Rome to the Caribbean and claimedto have discovered underwater formations off the Bimini Islands in the Bahamasthat are now known as the Bimini Road. In 1970, they published a book entitledAtlantis: The Autobiography of a Search concerning their adventure aboard theirboat, the Tana.Initial investigations indicated that the huge stone blocks and pavement stoneswere man-made, but as the name Atlantis began to be batted about in the mediaand corporate America became involved, the tone changed to disbelief.R. Cedric Leonard, author of Quest for Atlantis, along with J. Manson Valentineof the Science Museum of Miami, in 1970 studied a structure near the Bahamasisland of Andros called the Andros Temple. This structure measured approximatelysixty feet wide and a hundred feet in length with crumbling stone walls roughlythree feet thick. “This is clearly an edifice of importance built by amathematically sophisticated civilization,” he wrote. Leonard soon learned thatthe North American Rockwell Corporation, which had substantial land holdings onBimini, had been granted exclusive excavation rights on all the underwater ruinsin the area of Bimini Island. “Soon after, they hired a geologist with previousexperience in the area. …” According to Leonard, [journalist Robert Marxreported] “that the investigation was ‘brief,’ and that the geologist didn’teven go into the water for the ‘scientific’ inspection. … The hired geologistannounced shortly after that the walls were not man-made and that the columnswere nothing more than ‘ballast’ from a shipwreck.”The National Geographic Society eventually entered the picture, sponsoring aninvestigation by University of Miami geologist John Gifford, who carbon-datedthe age of the giant stones as fifteen thousand years old. Marine engineerDimitri Rebikoff, as far back as 1969, had stated that the Bimini Road isidentical to numerous ancient man-made harbors discovered throughout theMediterranean. Rebikoff, who spent much time and energy diving at the site,firmly disagreed with the skeptics who claimed that the site was all naturalformations because there were no leveling stones underneath the large stoneblocks at Bimini.Could these Caribbean ruins be the site of Atlantis? It’s hard to tell, mainlybecause so many professional archaeologists and geologists have backed away fromthe project. “Once speculation concerning Atlantis enters the picture,professionals begin to back away (and the way they were treated by their owncolleagues, who could blame them),” Leonard stated. Those who involvedthemselves with projects related to the site were ostracized, and due to thereluctance of qualified scientists within this academic environment, “thescientific community is overlooking significant and sound evidence.”THE MINOAN EMPIRE AND SANTORINI [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s34]More recent theories have placed Atlantis at various Mediterranean locations,including Crete, Cyprus, and the island of Santorini (ancient Thera). In his2011 book, The Lost Empire of Atlantis, author Gavin Menzies presented a cogentargument for the legend of Atlantis being simply a vague and garbledrecollection of the Minoan Empire, a Bronze Age seafaring civilization centeredon the island of Crete and named for its line of kings, collectively namedMinos. According to Menzies’s studies, Minoan ships ranged from the Americas toIndia. Their empire ended about 1500 BC with the gigantic eruption of thevolcano on the island of Santorini, which sent millions of tons of volcanic ashinto the atmosphere, produced intense atmospheric shock waves, and generateddisastrous tsunamis.Menzies wrote of ingots of nearly pure copper found in a sunken Minoan ship nearThera. Because copper of this quality is found only near Lake Superior in NorthAmerica, the Minoans clearly had amazing range with their fleet of ships.Menzies also noted that the tobacco beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, was found involcanic ash in the Minoan town of Akrotiri. This beetle is only indigenous tothe Americas.Because Menzies has equated the Minoan civilization with the Atlantean Empire,he believes that the great volcanic eruption on Santorini helped create thelegend of Atlantis. Much like the myth of Atlantis’s destruction taken fromPlato, the resulting tidal waves, deadly gaseous clouds, famine due to destroyedcrops, and opportunistic pirate clans finished off the great Minoan Empire,leaving remarkably little behind.Yet there are others who disagree with Menzies’s position. R. Cedric Leonardsaid that Menzies and others who believe Minoan Empire and Atlantis were one andthe same have mistakenly traced Atlantis back to the Bronze Age instead of theIce Age as described by Plato, who placed the time of Atlantis at about 9600 BC.“By thus ‘miniaturizing’ it (both size-wise and time-wise), it has been mademore palatable for modern scientists and scholars to accept,” said Leonard.“Plato describes Atlantis as having ‘subjected the parts of Libya within thecolumns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia.’ TheMinoan kings never conquered neither Europe nor North Africa. But archeologicalevidence is abundant indicating that a cohesive ‘megalithic culture’ occupiedthose very same areas of Europe and North Africa in Mesolithic times(5,000–6,000 years before the Minoan empire began).” Moreover, the area ofAtlantis as described by Plato was far larger than that ascribed to the Minoanculture.THE SOUTH CHINA SEA [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s35]Physicist James M. McCanney, who has studied exotic energy sources reaching backto antiquity, placed Atlantis at the opposite end of the Earth. He came tobelieve that Atlantis was located in the South China Sea prior to a shifting ofthe poles: “The South China Sea, before the rotation of the pole shift, wasabout five degrees south of the Equator. If you take a globe and you put yourfinger where the old North Pole used to be—north of the state of Michigan—andyou put your other finger on the globe in the South Indian Ocean—diametricallyopposed—and you rotate this Earth, you’ll find that the South China Sea, whereAtlantis was, ends-up just a few degrees south of the old Equator.” McCanney washeavily influenced by the Brazilian professor Arysio Nunes dos Santos, author ofAtlantis: The Lost Continent Finally Found. Explaining their theories, McCanneystated, “In ancient times, there was no Pacific Ocean by name, and the waterwayswere quite a bit different than they are now because of the tilt of the Earth.It was before a pole shift. What we call the Laurentian Ice Shield was actuallythe old North Pole. At the time, Siberia had a tropical climate with large herdsof Mastodons and vast tropical plains and forests. … Basically, the mantle, thelayer beneath the Earth’s crust, shifted by about 40 degrees.” He claimed thatPlato’s reference to a “real sea” was to the Ocean of the Atlanteans, or theAtlantic Ocean, which, in precataclysmic times, stretched unimpeded by northernice from the South China Sea eastward across the Pacific to the presentAtlantic. And the Pillars of Hercules did not refer to the Strait of Gibraltarbut to the island of Krakatoa and its sister volcano that sits now in the Straitof Sunda, between Sumatra and Java, the entrance into the channel leading to themain continent of Atlantis. “The ancient Greeks didn’t know that there was allof this—the North American continent and what we now call the Pacific, whichwas, in ancient days, simply one vast ocean called the Atlantic Ocean,”explained McCanney.OUT OF THIS WORLD [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s36]But McCanney went much further than simply naming a location for Atlantis. Headded spaceflight to the puzzle by describing Atlantis as… a very advanced culture that we hear about in legends that had directed energybeams, big mirrors, big lasers, had the ability to fly, and I believe, spaceflight. I believe that they were landing on Mars. They had regular movementbetween Earth and Mars, when Mars was a water planet. When Mars came very closein its orbit to Earth, it was a very simple shuttle trip to go to Mars, and youdid not have to take any provisions with you because Mars was a water planet,just like Earth. So, basically, there were civilizations on Mars, on Earth, andonce every 5 years or so, when the planets aligned, you could make a trip backand forth, which was quite commonplace at that time. … They knew aboutatmospheric electricity. They were able to tap into it. They had unlimitedelectrical power. They had been around for thousands of years, as opposed to,say, our civilization of modern, Western man in the United States, of the last100 years. In a 10,000-year period they would have been quite advanced, andlearned how to live with the environment without destroying themselves and theenvironment.Austrian-born researcher and writer Rich Anders had an even stranger take on thestory of Atlantis. Noting that Solon stated that Atlantis “disappeared” ratherthan sank into the sea, Anders postulated that Atlantis vanished into a parallelworld, another dimension, thus explaining the lack of evidence for itsexistence.“Greek paintings show the sun in different positions. For thousands of yearsthis planet has been revolving around an axis. Clearly, this is an indicationthat in the world before the planet did not revolve around an axis,” explainedAnders. “Furthermore, the predecessors of the Greek, the Hellenic people, knewof a place in the Atlantic called Aea. According to legend, its inhabitants weretechnologically very advanced and they did not fear death. Either they wereimmortals or they knew enough about death not to fear it. Most importantly,though, it was told that over Aea the sun was always in the midday position.This is yet another indication that as long as the parallel world, the paradise,existed, this planet did not revolve around an axis.”Much like Ignatius Donnelly, Anders believed the Atlanteans were gods, exceptthat they “did not make it into the present world. … Atlantis and everythingthat belonged to it remained in the parallel world, the paradise, whichdisappeared about 3,500 years ago.”POLE SHIFT AND ANTARCTICA [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s37]The pole shift described by James McCanney may explain some of the world’smysterious history. The 1513 maps of Admiral Piri Reis depicted an ancient Earthbecause the map’s coastlines had been handed down from the Phoenicians, who hadobtained them from even older maps. Reportedly, Columbus carried these maps onhis expeditions, and made notes indicating what is now Queen Maudland inAntarctica. Columbus had expected the shoreline to help guide him to India, buthe had instead run into a continent buried in ice. Today, through satelliteice-penetrating imaging, the shoreline has been shown to be identical with thePiri Reis map. So now Antarctica has been added to the many locations thought tobe the actual site of Atlantis. Could it be that this is where Atlantis waslocated? Some researchers today are suggesting that Atlantis exists under theice of Antarctica as the result of a pole shift.Though conventional science has brushed aside the idea that Earth’s poles mayhave shifted long ago, the public has become increasingly interested in theconcept of catastrophism, which is the idea that Earth has actually changedquickly and dramatically due to large-scale catastrophes, including pole shifts,earthquakes, floods, and meteor strikes from space, all of which could havewiped out civilizations like Atlantis. Much of this interest stems from the workof Charles Hapgood and Immanuel Velikovsky, who each observed different sets ofevidence indicating the earth’s quick changes. For instance, Velikovsky examinedthe electromagnetic effects of Earth’s shifts and close encounters with spaceobjects, specifically the planet Venus, while Hapgood has examined evidence fromshifts in plate tectonics or Earth-crust displacement.These men and their followers point to the fact that prehistoric animals havebeen found flash-frozen so quickly that their meat was still edible andundigested vegetation was still in their mouths. Tales of woolly mammothsabound, but one of the best documented of such accounts appeared in the 1990book of Alaska zoology by Dale Guthrie entitled Frozen Fauna of the MammothSteppe. Guthrie described how his team of researchers discovered athirty-six-thousand-year-old bison near Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1979. Theyproceeded to cook some of the meat in a pot of stock and vegetables. Guthriesaid that “the meat was well aged but still a little tough, and it gave the stewa strong Pleistocene aroma.”Stories like Guthrie’s support the idea that the Earth’s freezing happenedalmost instantaneously, as well as the catastrophism argument that a once-greatcivilization disappeared virtually overnight.Maurice Chatelain, who made a detailed mathematical study of ancient sites andlegends, wrote, “Personally I am convinced that the story of Atlantis, as Solonheard it from Sonchis and as Plato has given it to us, is true from beginning toend and that someday the ruins of Atlantis will be found, just as one afteranother we found the once legendary Troy, Mycenae, Tiryns, and Knossos.”A WORLDWIDE CIVILIZATION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s38]With Antarctica added to the list of places posited as the source of theAtlantis legend, the debate continued. It appears clear, however, thatregardless of where it was located, the evidence indicates that a widespread andadvanced civilization did indeed exist in prehistory. The evidence of Atlantislies all about us, unrecognized for what it is because of narrow-minded thinkingand conditioning.In 1910, Oxford professor and Nobel laureate Frederick Soddy stated, “Some ofthe beliefs and legends bequeathed to us by antiquity are so universally andfirmly established that we have become accustomed to consider them as beingalmost as ancient as humanity itself. Nevertheless we are tempted to inquire howfar the fact that some of these beliefs and legends have so many features incommon is due to chance, and whether the similarity between them may not pointto the existence of an ancient, totally unknown and unsuspected civilization ofwhich all other traces have disappeared.”Some have suggested that the search for this ancient civilization, whether itwas called Atlantis, Mu, Lemuria, or anything else, can be compared to the Hindufable of the blind men and the elephant. The basic story is that a group ofblind men went to a zoo to experience an elephant. When asked to describe theelephant, each had a different version. The blind man who felt the elephant’shead said it was like a large pot. The man who touched the elephant’s ear saidit was like a fan. One who touched the tusk said it was like a plowshare; theone touching its trunk described it as a hose, while the one touching the tailsaid it was like a rope. One who pushed against the elephant’s side said it waslike a wall, while the one who put his arms around the elephant’s leg said itwas like a pillar.The point is that like the blind men and the elephant, none of the Atlantisresearchers are right—but then again, none are wrong. They all have a piece ofthe truth, which is that at one time, long before our recorded history, thereexisted on Earth a global, highly technological civilization that fell into ruindue to natural catastrophes, war, or both.Many, including Professor Hapgood, have reached this same conclusion. He wrote,“The evidence presented by ancient maps appears to suggest the existence inremote times, before the rise of any known cultures, of a true civilization, ofan advanced kind, which either was localized in one area but had worldwidecommerce, or was, in a real sense, a worldwide culture. This culture, at leastin some respects, was more advanced than the civilizations of Greece and Rome.”Early in the twentieth century, Charles Fort extended this hypothesis to includespeculation that this vanished culture was the product of extraterrestrials.Maurice Chatelain, who noted how the scientific knowledge of astronomy byancient peoples, such as the Sumerians, was “far superior” to that ofastronomers only three hundred years ago, went so far as to state that allterrestrial civilizations evolved from the same source and this was “someextraterrestrial source in human affairs many thousands of years ago.” He added,“This theory is already generally accepted by the public and also is considereda possibility by part of the scientific establishment, but it is difficult toget the official scientific establishment to accept this theory because it wouldturn upside down all traditional scientific beliefs. Nevertheless, this theoryis true and accurate, because there is none other that would better explain thesudden appearance of intelligent man and his very advanced scientific knowledgeso long ago.”"},{"pageContent":"SUMER: THE FIRST KNOWN CIVILIZATION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha06]WHILE THE VERY EXISTENCE OF ATLANTIS IS STILL BEING DEBATED, we find the firstof the great recorded civilizations was ancient Sumer. Also known as Shinar andChaldea, this civilization arose between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in thearea known today as Iraq, which derived its name from the ancient Sumerian cityof Uruk. From Sumer came an amazing and fully evolved civilization that handeddown the basics for all ensuing Western cultures, from written language and lawto mathematics, agriculture, and astronomy.According to conventional history, Sumer grew out of a collection ofhunter-gatherer clans who banded together to form the first human civilizationwithin the Tigris-Euphrates Valley about 4000 BC. Yet by 3300 BC, archaeologicalstudies have shown that Sumerians had drained marshes, dug canals, constructeddams and dikes, and built a large-scale irrigation system next to gleamingcities containing huge pyramidal structures called ziggurats. What prompted thissudden spurt of civilization?About 2400 BC, Sumer was invaded from the west and north by Semitic tribes, andby about 2350 BC was captive to the warrior king Sargon the Great, who foundedthe Semite Akkadian Dynasty, whose empire stretched from the Persian Gulf to theMediterranean. After years of wars and population displacements, the lands ofSumer were united under Hammurabi of Babylon, who’s famous code of laws may havebeen instituted to discipline the mass migrations of people taking place at thattime due to wars and geophysical catastrophes. It is now clear that the Code ofHammurabi was drawn from laws set down by the Sumerians centuries earlier,particularly the earliest law code yet discovered, issued by the Sumerian kingUr-Nammu.Virtually nothing was known about the Sumerians until about 150 years ago, whenarchaeologists, spurred by the seventeenth-century writings of Italian travelerPietro della Valle, began to dig into the strange mounds that dotted thecountryside in southern Iraq. In 1843, the Frenchman Paul-Émile Botta discoveredSargon II’s palace near modern-day Khorsabad, and soon after, archaeologistsfound buried cities, broken palaces, artifacts, and thousands of clay tabletsdetailing every facet of Sumerian life. By the late 1800s, Sumerian wasconsidered an original language and was being translated. Despite today’sknowledge, the general public still has been taught little about this firstgreat human civilization, which suddenly materialized in Mesopotamia.Before it strangely vanished, it had greatly influenced life as far east as theIndus River and as far west as Palestine and Egypt. In fact, it would appearthat civilizations such as those of the Akkadians, Phoenicians, Minoans,Assyrians, Babylonians, and even the Egyptians were merely devolved versions ofancient Sumer. Yet the public has long believed them to be separate entities, anassumption which has hindered a truthful understanding of human history.CUNEIFORM TABLETS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s39]Despite our superficial knowledge of the Sumerians, we have already been able tocredit them with many world “firsts.” Samuel Noah Kramer, author of HistoryBegins at Sumer and The Sumerians, noted that these people developed the wheel,schools, medical science, the first written proverbs, history, the firstbicameral congress, taxation, laws, social reforms, the first cosmogony andcosmology, and the first money (a weighed silver shekel), as well as the firstwriting system, cuneiform.Sumerian cuneiform writing may reveal more to us about Sumerian culture than weknow about the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The papyrus papers ofother elder empires disintegrated over time or were destroyed by the fires ofwar, but cuneiform was etched onto wet clay tablets with a wedge-shaped stylus.These tablets were then dried, baked, and kept in large libraries. About fivehundred thousand of these clay tablets have now been found, providing invaluableknowledge of ancient Sumer (which is not to be confused with the BiblicalSamaria, the name of a mountain, city, and region north of Jerusalem).The Sumerian tablets went undeciphered until 1802, when a German high schoolteacher named Georg Grotefend began systematically translating the trilingualPersian inscription of Darius the Great on the Behistun Rock, which included aversion in Babylonian cuneiform. Today nearly eighty percent of cuneiformtablets have not yet been translated into English because the sheer quantity hasoverwhelmed the world’s handful of translators.The Sumerian alphabet was essentially shorthand for a much older originallanguage made up of logograms (symbols representing concepts rather than words)similar to antique Chinese characters. Because this older language was not asdetailed as English, many different translations may stem from a Sumeriansentence.LONGEVITY AND NUMBERS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s40]One ancient Sumerian document, known as the King List, described not their“gods” but the earliest Sumerian rulers and the lengths of their reigns. Atfirst glance, the list seems preposterous, as it states, “After the kingshipdescended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridu. In Eridu, Alulim became king;he ruled for 28,800 years.” Other kings served even longer, according to thelist. For example, Alalngar reigned for 36,000 years, while En-men-lu-ana ruledfor an amazing 43,200 years.Such longevity is also recorded in the Bible, wherein Methuseleh, Noah, Seth,Enos, and others are reported to have lived more than nine hundred years. InChina, rulers of the first dynasties each ruled more than seven hundred years,while the Hindu Vedas state that prior to 3000 BC, the life span was about athousand years.After the Great Flood, these numbers began to decrease until Gilgamesh ruled fora mere 126 years, followed by others whose reigns were in only the double-digitrange. Either there was something very wrong with the ancient counting systemsor there was something very unearthly about their rulers. Could extraterrestrialintervention in human evolution account for such longevity? Could the promise ofa much longer life be used today to gain the allegiance of ranking politicianswho otherwise would disdain bribes or other enticements?Sumerians traveled frequently and widely and are thought to have brought theiradvanced shipbuilding technology and mapping abilities to the early Phoenicians,who settled along the eastern Mediterranean coast in what is now Lebanon andlater traveled the world.Sumerian knowledge of the heavens was both amazing and puzzling. “The wholeconcept of spherical astronomy, including the 360-degree circle, the zenith, thehorizon, the celestial axis, the poles, the ecliptic, the equinoxes, etc., allarose suddenly in Sumer,” noted Alan Alford. Sumerian knowledge of the movementsof the sun and moon resulted in the world’s first calendar, used for centuriesafterward by the Semites, Egyptians, and Greeks.Few people realize that we also owe our geometry and modern timekeeping systemsto the Sumerians. “The origin of 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in aminute is not arbitrary, but designed around a sexagesimal (based on the number60) system,” Alford reported. He added that the modern zodiac was a Sumeriancreation based on their twelve “gods.” They used it to chart a greatprecessional cycle that would take 25,920 years to fully complete, a periodknown as the Platonic year. “The uncomfortable question which the scientistshave avoided is this: how could the Sumerians, whose civilization only lasted2,000 years, possibly have observed and recorded a celestial cycle that took25,920 years to complete? And why did their civilization begin in the middle ofa zodiac period? Is this a clue that their astronomy was a legacy from thegods?” asked Alford.His question could be enlarged to question how the early primitive humans ofalmost six thousand years ago suddenly transformed from small packs ofhunter-gatherers into a full-blown—advanced even by today’sstandards—civilization?MYTH OR HISTORY? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s41]It is difficult to believe that primitive humans acquired so much knowledge ontheir own overnight. Through thousands of translated Sumerian tablets along withtheir inscribed cylinder seals, perhaps we should allow the Sumerians themselvesto explain.The answer, echoing claims from many other ancient peoples, is that all theirknowledge came from their “gods.” Scholars in the past believed the Sumerianswere talking about ethereal and imaginary beings in the sky. Today a growingnumber of researchers suspect they might well have been referring to physicalbeings who would descend to earth, much like the gods of ancient Greece, such asZeus and Athena.“All the ancient peoples believed in gods who had descended to Earth from theheavens and who could at will soar heavenwards,” explained Zecharia Sitchin inthe prologue to the first book of a series detailing his translations andinterpretations of Sumerian accounts of their origin and history. “But thesetales were never given credibility, having been branded by scholars from thevery beginning as myths.”Yet Sitchin and many others have questioned why ancient scribes would have takenthe time and energy to painstakingly write down fables of absolute dreamlikefantasy. Wouldn’t it be more reasonable to conclude that they wrote such talesas fables to recount dimly remembered history?Understanding the Sumerian version of the human origin requires only a slightshift in mind-set. Sitchin and others simply believe that the ancient Sumeriansmay have just been putting down on their clay tablets history as they understoodit rather than fanciful myths.The Sumerian descriptions of many ancient cities were believed to be mere fablesuntil their ruins were discovered and excavated. In 2003, scientists claimed tohave found the tomb of Gilgamesh, previously thought by most to have been merelya mythological character. Why not also consider their written history asreality?Regarding the ancient texts, author Paul Von Ward stated, “To accept them onlyas fantasy or metaphor, we must first be able to demonstrate that they do notrefer to actual events. Until we have proven their claims are false, we have nodefensible justification for not interpreting them as plausible scenarios in ourstill-evolving knowledge.” Ward added that while it is easy to find data onnonhuman beings in the historical record, “you will find—as I did—that thetoughest challenge lies in overcoming our institutionally implantedassumptions.”We also must remember that before the twentieth century and the advent ofheavier-than-air flight, scholars would not have thought of spaceflight aspossible. Thus, Sitchin reasoned, “Now that astronauts have landed on the Moon,and unmanned spacecraft explore other planets, it is no longer impossible tobelieve that a civilization on another planet more advanced than ours wascapable of landing its astronauts on the planet Earth sometime in the past.” Noris it impossible now to consider the biological manipulation of a species inlight of the modern sciences of cloning and in vitro fertilization.The belief in ancient gods from the sky was not the sole province of MiddleEastern cults. In North America, the Blackfoot tribe awaited the promised returnof Napi, said to be the son of the sun and the moon. In legend, Napi, also knownas the Old Man, created humans from clay and taught them the skills to survive.Other Algonquians watched for Glooscap, the legendary figure who created humansand brought them knowledge. In Central America, when the Spanish conquistadorsarrived, the Aztecs welcomed them as the return of their ancient god,Quetzalcoatl.After researching numerous American legends of creation, Von Ward noted,Quetzalcoatl … reportedly sprinkled his blood with the bones of earliercreatures to create humans. In the American West, the Selish tribes’ creator …Amotken used hair from his head to create the first five women. The Quinaults ofthe Pacific Northwest believe their “changer god Kwatee” created humans from hisown sweat. All these methods could imply a contribution of the gods’ DNA. Andthese gods, as did the Anunnaki, came from the sky.In fact, mythologies from around the world appear to tell the same essentialstory—that in ancient times individuals with “godlike” powers arrived to restorecivilization following a period of catastrophes.Quetzalcoatl, the great teacher of the Mayans, was known as Viracocha to theIncas and as the sun god Ra to the Egyptians. Sargon, the first great leader ofthe Akkadian dynasty, which succeeded the Sumerians, attributed his knowledge tothe god Anu, while the Babylonian king Hammurabi was said to have gained powerthrough Marduk, again a reference to the accounts of the Anunnaki.In India, it is believed that man is descended from gods who flew in fiery craftcalled vimanas. The Teutons point to ancestors in flying craft called Wanen. Theancient Mayans thought their predecessors came from the Pleiades, while theIncas said simply that they were the “sons of the sun.” Chinese texts tell oflong-lived rulers from the heavens who sailed through the skies in“fire-breathing dragons.” The Dogon tribe in Mali, West Africa, tells of spacetravelers called Nommos, who came to Earth thousands of years ago from theSirius star system and gave them detailed information about their world and oursolar system. The Dogon described Sirius as having dual or binary suns, a factnot known until recent years. Debunkers, including the late Carl Sagan, tried toargue that recent Western visitors had given them such information, perhapsinadvertently. However, this theory failed to explain a four-hundred-year-oldDogon artifact that apparently correctly depicts the Sirius configuration orceremonies conducted by the Dogons since the thirteenth century celebrating thecycle of Sirius A and B.Most of these accounts lack any physical evidence to support them. However, atleast one account of ancient visitors did provide such evidence, though the caseended tragically. In 1938, archaeologist Chi Pu Tei discovered regularly alignedrows of graves in the Baian Kara Ula Mountains near the Sino-Tibetan border.Beneath cave drawings of beings wearing helmets along with depictions of thestars, sun, and moon, small frail skeletons with unusually large skulls werefound. Chi Pu Tei theorized that the skeletons belonged to an extinct species ofmountain ape and that the drawings were left in the caves later by human tribes.Since the graves were in systematic rows, his theory was laughed at andforgotten until 1962, when stone plates found among the graves were translatedby Professor Tsum Um Nui of the Academy of Prehistoric Research in Beijing.The translation told an eerie story of a group of beings who claimed to havecome from star system Sirius and crash-landed on Earth about twelve thousandyears ago. Unable to repair their craft, this group attempted to make friendswith the mountain tribes but were hunted down and killed due to their nonhumanfeatures. Locals buried them with circular holed stones strikingly identical tosome UFO descriptions. Since this account was not compatible with the Westernworldview, it, too, was dismissed, but curiously, the mountainous crash siteremains off limits to foreigners."},{"pageContent":"THE ANUNNAKI: IMPROVING THE BREED? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha07]IN SEVERAL ACCOUNTS ETCHED PERMANENTLY INTO THEIR CLAY tablets, the ancientSumerian scribes gave more detail as to the source of their knowledge. Theywrote that 432,000 years before the Great Flood, the Anunnaki arrived and taughtthem the basics of civilization.According to the interpretations of Zecharia Sitchin and many others, the termAnunnaki means “those who came from the heavens to the Earth.” In Sitchin’snarrative, these were astronauts from the planet Nibiru who traveled through theGreat Bracelet (the asteroid belt) and initially landed in the Persian Gulf.There they began to colonize and search for gold. But strikes broke out over thehard work, and it was decided to engineer a slave race by manipulating the DNAof primitives on Earth. Thereafter, kings and dynasties were established amongthe new hybrids, which led to conflicts, warfare, and widespread devastation.Michael Tellinger noted that Zulu creation legends agree with Sitchin’sinterpretation of the Sumerian tablets.Most of African mythology speaks about the same things, the sky gods theabelungu who came down from the sky. They created the people, to mine gold. TheZulu people, people from the sky. The abelungu have the same aspects as ascribedto the Anunnaki in the Sumerian tablets. Credo Mutwa [an African shaman] tellsus Abantu in Zulu means the children of Antu. Antu is the Sumerian Goddess ofthe Abzu—where the gold came from. Lord Enki is also known as Enkei as thecreator-god, the Sumerian medicine man. He cloned a species. His symbol is themedical symbol, caduceus. This is one of the oldest symbols on the earth encodedwith so much knowledge and information we can spend a lecture on it alone.THE NEFILIM CHAIN OF COMMAND [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s42]According to Sitchin’s interpretations of Sumerian texts, about 450,000 yearsago, during Earth’s Pleistocene ice age, the highly developed inhabitants ofNibiru—the Anunnaki—journeyed to Earth as the two planets came into proximity.Their initial landings were made in the Persian Gulf, just as our own astronautsat first splashed down in the ocean.Logically, these ancient astronauts would have sought a base camp that couldprovide moderate weather and a good source of water and fuel. Only one locationmet all these criteria—the Fertile Crescent, which included the Tigris andEuphrates river valleys in Mesopotamia.With the supreme Nibirian ruler, Anu—or An or El, depending on thesource—supervising their effort from the home planet, the Anunnaki began asystematic colonization of Earth under the leadership of Anu’s two sons, Enliland Enki. All of the Anunnaki leaders were later to assume the role of “gods,”or Nefilim, to their human subjects. Nefilim was translated by almost allancient writers as those who had “fallen.” In religious terms, they were thoughtto be angels who fell from the grace of God. But “fallen” can also be seen asthose who came down, and in more recent times, the term has taken on the meaningof giants who were a hybrid of two species.In the tablets’ story, Enlil was the mission commander, while Enki served asexecutive and science officer. There was immediate and long-standing antagonismbetween the two half-brothers, due to Nibirian protocol. As in later Earthdynasties, the firstborn, Enki, was relegated to secondary status because hismother was not the official wife of Anu. This removed him from the royal line ofsuccession. Yet it was Enki who led the first expedition to Earth.Enki was both scientist and engineer. Under his leadership, the marshes on thenorthern shore of the Persian Gulf were drained, dikes were constructed, andirrigation systems were dug, as well as canals connecting the Tigris with theEuphrates. Reinforcements later arrived under the leadership of Enki’s firstbornson, Marduk.There is no doubt that the Anunnaki were real and important. The prologue to theLawcode of Hammurabi refers to these same Anunnaki overlords, stating,When exalted Anu, king of the divinities [the Anunnaki], and Enlil, lord ofheaven and earth, the determiner of the destinies of the land, determined forMarduk, the first-born of Enki, the dominion over the whole of humankind, madehim the greatest among the deities, called Babylon by its exalted name, made itsupreme in the world, and established for him in its midst an eternal kingship,whose foundations are as firm as heaven and earth, then it was that Anu andEnlil named me, Hammurabi, the devout and god-fearing prince, to promote thewelfare of the people, to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy thewicked and the evil, that the strong might not oppress the weak, to rise likethe sun over the black-headed people, and to light up the land.SITCHIN’S CRITICS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s43]The translations by Sitchin and others have gathered many detractors, especiallyover the depiction of the Anunnaki as extraterrestrials. Michael Heiser, whoearned degrees in the Hebrew Bible and ancient Semitic languages and was one ofSitchin’s most vociferous critics, stated on his website, SitchinIsWrong.com,“that what Sitchin has written about Nibiru, the Anunnaki, the book of Genesis,the Nephilim, and a host of other things has absolutely no basis in the realdata of the ancient world.”In an open letter to Sitchin, now addressed to “Ancient Astronaut Enthusiast”following Sitchin’s death in 2010, Heiser argued that the name Anunnaki appearsnowhere in the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature published on theInternet by the University of Oxford.While technically this may be true, the term Anuna gods appears numerous timesin the literature and obviously could be collectivized into the plural termAnunnaki. One example of this term from the Oxford Sumerian texts recounts theboasts of Enki, who proclaimed, “With An the king, on An’s dais, I overseejustice. With Enlil, looking out over the lands, I decree good destinies. He hasplaced in my hands the decreeing of fates in the place where the sun rises. I amcherished by Nintur. I am named with a good name by Ninhursaga. I am the leaderof the Anuna gods. I was born as the firstborn son of holy An.”Naturally, no reputable scientist who desires to protect conventional textbooksand his funding sources would publicly admit to subscribing to Sitchin’stheories, yet many thousands have followed Sitchin’s work, some researchersaugmenting the details of his narrative. Author, psychologist, and minister PaulVon Ward spoke for many when he wrote, “Although I do not agree with hiscosmology … his elucidation of historical details and connection of them toother fields of knowledge stand up under comparative review with the work ofother scholars. His summary of information relating to the ‘olden gods’ known inSumeria as the Anunnaki presents a cohesive and defensible mixture of textualmaterial and judicious interpretation.”C. L. Turnage, an author who has studied more than three hundred translations ofancient Mesopotamian and Vedic writings, including the extrabiblical Book ofEnoch, wrote, “After studying [Sitchin’s] theory, I began my own contemplationof the pre-biblical Babylonian Epic of Creation or Enuma Elish. It was from astudy of this narrative that Sitchin became aware of the planet Nibiru and itsestablishment within our own solar system. This tale was originally written onseven clay tablets, each corresponding to a ‘day’ of creation. … The creation ofman was recorded on the sixth tablet, while the seventh was reserved for theexaltation of the Babylonian national deity Marduk, the ‘creator god.’ After myown study of these chronicles, I concurred with Sitchin’s findings. It doesappear that the first three chapters of Genesis, particularly the seven days ofcreation, were actually derived from the older creation epic, and otherchronicles—then revamped to meet Hebrew theology. Why would the Hebrews borrowthe creation story from older Mesopotamian texts? Was it because they worshippedone of the Mesopotamian deities themselves?”AN EARLY GOLD RUSH [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s44]Over thousands of years Earth time, according to the Sumerian narrative, theAnunnaki continued to put a thriving colony in place, and their attention turnedto their primary objective—gold.Some researchers have composed elaborate metaphysical explanations for Anunnakiactivities on Earth, many having to do with energy fields and spiritual planesdisrupted by the passing of Nibiru and the creation of Earth. One theory wasthat the more highly evolved Anunnaki were attempting to rescue “lost souls”left behind after the planetary collision.But more documented and acceptable is the idea of Sitchin and others that thesecolonists were after Earth’s mineral wealth—particularly gold—for use on theirhome planet. “The Anunnaki sought gold to save their atmosphere, which hadapparently sprung leaks similar to those we have created in ours by damaging theEarth’s ozone layer with hydrofluorocarbons,” explained author Lloyd Pye. “TheAnunnaki solution was to disperse extremely tiny flakes of gold into their upperatmosphere to patch holes. … Ironically, modern scientists contend that if weare ever forced to repair our own damaged ozone layer, tiny particulates of goldshot into the upper atmosphere would be the best way to go about it.”This theory is not so far-fetched when one considers that in 1997 a researchteam led by the physicist Edward Teller, known as the father of the hydrogenbomb, proposed various methods for controlling solar radiation, including theseeding of heavy metals, such as gold particles, into the upper atmosphere.Also, it is known that gold is an excellent conductor of electromagnetic energy,and it never rusts. In fact, in April 2009, President Obama’s science adviser,John P. Holdren, publicly suggested that heavy-metal “pollutants” be sprayedinto the upper atmosphere to create a heat shield to retard perceived “globalwarming.”But when the Anunnaki attempted to retrieve gold from the Persian Gulf by anextraction process, it proved inefficient and time-consuming. Anu, along withhis heir Enlil, visited the colony and assigned Enki to find more gold. Enlilwas placed in overall command of the Earth colony while Enki led a foray toAfrica and eventually to South America, where he set up gold-mining operations.Proof of such early gold mining has come from scientific studies conducted forthe Anglo-American Corporation, a leading South African mining company, in the1970s. According to South African author Michael Tellinger, company scientistsdiscovered evidence of thousands of ancient mining operations, some dated as farback as 100,000 BC. Similar ancient mine excavations have been found in Centraland South America. They indicate that the Anunnaki mining efforts were worldwideand may go far in explaining the early diffusion of humans.Further substantiation of such wide-ranging travel may be found by comparing thenames of ancient Mesopotamian cities and localities as recorded by thesecond-century AD geographer Ptolemy to counterparts for gold-mining sites inCentral America: MESOPOTAMIAN NAME CENTRAL AMERICAN NAME Chol Chol-ulaColua Colua-can Zuivana Zuivan Cholima Colima Zalissa Xalisco The raw mined ore was then carried from the far-flung mines by cargo craft backto Mesopotamia for smelting and processing into hourglass-shaped ingots calledzag, or “purified precious.” Engravings of such ingots are numerous, and some ofthe actual ingots have been found in archaeological excavations.In an effort to ease the increasing rivalry between the half-brothers Enlil andEnki, their father, Anu, placed Enlil in charge of the Mesopotamian colonyE-din—perhaps the basis for the biblical Eden—while assigning Enki to Ab-zu, orAfrica, the “land of the mines.”OUT OF AFRICA [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s45]A number of writers believe that the Anunnaki mined gold on Earth for more thana hundred thousand years, until the rank-and-file Anunnaki, who were doing thebackbreaking work in the mines, mutinied about three hundred thousand years ago.On top of the unrelenting drudgery of the mining operations, difficulties forthese extraterrestrial colonists had increased due to climate changes.Enlil, the commander in chief, wanted to punish the workers for their rebellion.He called an Assembly of the Great Anunnaki, which included his father, Anu, whowas more sympathetic to the plight of the Anunnaki miners. He saw that the workof the mutineers was very hard and that their distress was considerable. OneSumerian text reported, “The load is excessive, it is killing us! Our work istoo hard, the trouble too much! So every single one of us gods has agreed tocomplain to Ellil [Enlil].”Enlil wondered aloud if there wasn’t another way to obtain gold. At this point,Enki suggested that a primitive worker, called an Adamu, be created to take overthe difficult work. Enki pointed out that a primitive humanoid—what we call Homoerectus or a closely related hominid—was quite prevalent in Abzu (Africa), wherehe maintained a laboratory.Just as today we furiously debate animal experimentation, gene splicing, andcloning, the Anunnaki also debated the morality of tinkering with a species.Anunnaki leaders argued, “Creation in the hands of the Father of All Beginningalone is held!”Enki counterargued that producing a hybrid—half Anunnaki and half primitivehuman—would not be an act of creation but merely improving the existing breed.Many people today believe that Sitchin and his followers are claiming thataliens created humans. Instead, the process as described in the Sumerian tabletswas only a breeding program similar to what has been done with various animalsby mankind to improve the stock.And so Enki’s plan to create a worker race in Africa was approved by theAnunnaki Assembly, and the Anunnaki created a race in their image. Sound like afamiliar refrain? One of the most puzzling verses in the Bible, Genesis 1:26,assures readers that there is only one true God, but then quotes God in theplural, stating, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness …” Could theplural gods here be the Anunnaki?The Genesis verse may reveal two things about our history. The first is that theplural Elohim of the Old Testament, later interpreted as “God” by themonotheists who wrote Genesis, indeed may have referred to the AnunnakiAssembly. The second idea from this verse is that creating man “in our image”meant simply genetic manipulation of an existing species, not the creation of anew race. As Zecharia Sitchin explained, “As both Orientalists and Biblescholars now know … the editing and summarizing by the compilers of the Book ofGenesis [was] of much earlier and considerably more detailed texts first writtendown in Sumer.”The Anunnaki Earth mission’s medical officer was a female named Ninhursag, whohad already been working with Enki in genetic experimentation. On at least oneSumerian cylinder seal, an illustration of Enki and Ninhursag depicted themsurrounded by vials or vessels, a table, shelves, a plant, and a helper, lookingvery much like a laboratory. Enki and Ninhursag produced many mutated creatures,including animals, such as bulls and lions with human heads, winged animals andapes, and humanoids with the head and feet of goats. If true, it is obvious thatthese experiments may have been the source for the many legends of“mythological” creatures and superhumans, such as Atlas, Goliath, Polyphemus,and Typhon.In addition to these fantastic creatures, the Sumerian tablets describe how Enkiproduced the first test-tube infant by combining DNA and producing a hybrid ofhuman and alien origin in his laboratory. Could this be why recent studies ofmitochondrial DNA indicate that all of Earth’s humans can be traced back to oneprimitive female who lived in Africa?Michael Tellinger and South African researcher Johan Heine have addedconsiderable strength to the argument that modern humans are the offspring ofthe Anunnaki gods from space.The pair has unearthed startling new evidence that human civilization is farolder than believed by conventional history and that large human habitants wereflourishing within huge communities in South Africa more than two hundredthousand years ago. In fact, they claim that they may have found the location ofEnki’s laboratory at the ruins called Adam’s Calendar on the TransvaalEscarpment.In Temples of the African Gods, Tellinger and Heine wrote, “The discoveries wehave been making right here since 2003 are so astonishing that they will requirea dramatic paradigm shift in our perception of human history. … A newunderstanding of the real history of humankind may just provide some of theanswers we have been searching for and deliver a new sense of comfort for manywho feel betrayed by our historians and especially by our religions.”Tellinger and Heine claim that even the Sumerian civilization may have beenpreceded by an African culture whose settlements covered most of South Africaand may have even known how to harness free energy from the Earth. An ancientpetroglyph found in Africa, a circle containing a cross inside a sweepingboomerang shape, resembles the famous winged disc normally associated withSumer, Babylonia, and Egypt. Another connection between Africa and Sumer may befound in the names of their gods, which bear a striking resemblance to theSumerian overlords. “It is astonishing to discover that ancient Zulu culture andreligion, including those of all other Bantu tribes, is directly linked to theSumerians,” noted Tellinger and Heine.“Our proof comes in the form of large stone monolith statues, petroglyphs andsymbols, discovered in Mpumalanga and other parts of South Africa, which werepreviously believed to be of Sumerian and Egyptian origins.” Tellinger and Heinehave also been careful to look at the Sumerian tablets to formulate theirconclusions. “These tablets are the oldest written record of human history andthe constant reference to southern Africa in these tablets leaves little doubtthat there was a lot of activity here, long before Sumer or Egypt wereestablished. It is now very clear that the first civilization merged manythousands of years ago in a land the Sumerians called the ABZU—the land of theFIRST [emphasis in the original] people in southern Africa—where the gold camefrom.”THE HYBRID [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s46]The Sumerian account of the creation of the first man—written as Lu-lu in theSumerian or in Hebrew, Adama, literally translated as Man of Earth or simplyEarthling—is quite clear in light of today’s knowledge concerning cloning and invitro fertilization. But up to twenty-five years ago or so, the whole conceptwould have been incomprehensible to even the most learned scholar.It is written that Enki and Ninhursag took the reproductive cell or egg from aprimitive African female hominid and fertilized it with the sperm of a youngAnunnaki male. The fertilized ovum was then placed inside an Anunnakiwoman—reportedly by one of Enki’s own wives, Ninki—who carried the child toterm.Although a Cesarean section was required at birth, a healthy young male Adamahybrid was produced for the first time on Earth, bypassing natural evolution bymillions of years. According to the ancient Sumerian reporters, “When Mankindwas first created, they knew not the eating of bread, knew not the dressing withgarments, ate plants with their mouth like sheep, drank water from the ditch. …”Human antiquity lends much support to the legitimacy of the Sumerian accounts ofhumankind’s beginnings. And consider that both the Dogon tribe in Africa and theaborigines of Australia—continents apart—both claim knowledge passed down formore than fifty thousand years of human creation by beings who came from thestars.If this seems like a far stretch of the imagination, consider that theEncyclopaedia Britannica tells the same story, only it is under the heading ofMesopotamian mythology.Until about 1996, when Dolly the sheep was cloned in Scotland, scholars readingthe Sumerian texts regarding the hybridization and cloning of humans are excusedfor believing the stories were all fanciful myths. But today, cloning, genesplicing, and in vitro fertilization are commonplace procedures.In July 2011, a modern parallel to the Sumerian story of humankind’s creationbecame apparent when it was revealed that human-animal hybrids were secretlybeing created by scientists in Britain. According to reports, 155 embryos,containing both human and animal genetic material, had been created since theintroduction of Britain’s 2008 Human Fertilisation Embryology Act. Thisresearch, conducted in hopes of finding cures for disease, was carried out inlabs at King’s College in London, Newcastle University, and Warwick University.Lord David Alton of Liverpool criticized the research, proclaiming, “I argued inParliament against the creation of human-animal hybrids as a matter ofprinciple. None of the scientists who appeared before us could give us anyjustification in terms of treatment.” Although officials said the scientistswere not concerned over the human-animal hybrid embryos, because legally theymust be destroyed within fourteen days, the experiments were stopped, reportedlydue to lack of funding.Continuing the Anunnaki narrative, Enki and Ninhursag went on to produce anumber of Adamas, both male and female, although at this time they wereincapable of reproduction and lived very short lives compared to the Anunnaki.This was apparently done in a conscious effort to prevent any competition fromthe new human race. It is interesting to note that, according to Genesis 3:5,the very first order of the Elohim was that man—in the allegorical form of Adamand Eve—was to remain ignorant, lest “ye shall be as gods” (King James Version).The “laboratory” which produced the first Adamas was called Shi-im-ti, or “thehouse where the wind of life is breathed in,” by the Sumerians. Compare thisphrase with Genesis 2:7, in which God, after forming man from “the dust of theground” or adamu, meaning “earth,” “breathed into his nostrils the breath oflife.”“Adam was the first test-tube baby,” proclaimed Sitchin after the birth of thefirst modern test-tube baby in 1978. He saw this modern birth as support for hisSumerian translations.That the ancient Sumerians passed along symbols representing the long-forgottenscience of cloning is suggested by the caduceus, the logo of physicians eventoday. This ancient symbol of life-giving medical treatment represented byentwined snakes along a winged staff bears a striking resemblance to the doublespiral strings of DNA molecules. DNA, discovered only in 1946, is the compoundwithin nucleated cells that stores that individual organism’s genetic blueprint.It is the manipulation of DNA that can produce a duplicate (clone) or hybrid.The first human workers were like mules and could not procreate. The Anunnakihad to constantly create new batches, a time-consuming procedure considering thespan of time between in vitro fertilization and birth. So Enki and Ninhursag setabout to create an Adama race that could reproduce itself.Genesis 2:8–15 makes it clear that the Adamas were created elsewhere and thenplaced in the Garden of Eden, or that area of the original Anunnaki colonycalled E-din, described as the plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.The Sumerian texts relate how an envious Enlil raided Enki’s African lab andreturned with captives to E-din, where they were put to work producing food andserving the Anunnaki. It has been theorized that in retaliation for Enlil’s raidon his African lab, Enki traveled to Eden, where he created a human-reproductionlab for Enlil but secretly manipulated the genetic code to allow sexualreproduction.Although the Sumerian texts describing the details of this process have beeneither lost or are as yet undiscovered, researchers have assumed that theprocedure involved obtaining life-producing Adama DNA, possibly by extracting arib while the subject was under anesthesia. This time the male Adama’s DNA wascombined with a female Adama rather than an Anunnaki, possibly with someaccompanying DNA-sequence cutting and splicing, a procedure within the abilitiesof our technology today.The result was a male Adama with the ability to reproduce through sex with anAdama female, or to “know” a woman, as the Bible euphemistically puts it. Theman Adam had gained the “knowledge” of reproduction, a fact that manyElohim/Anunnaki, including Enlil, deplored. They complained that next the humanswould want to live as long as they themselves. “The man has now become like oneof us, knowing good and evil,” reported Genesis 3:22 (New InternationalVersion). “He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from thetree of life and eat, and live forever.” Therefore, DNA manipulation drasticallyreduced the human life span along with the ability to make full use of humanbrain capacity.Such manipulation may explain the telomeres, caps on the ends of the humanchromosomes. These caps, something like the protective caps on shoelaces, aftera certain length of time prevent cells from reproducing, leading to oxidation,aging, and eventually death. No one knows for certain how or why these caps wereplaced in the DNA, but they prevent extended life. Furthermore, in 2011,researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced that telomere shortening islinked to diabetes, cancer, lung disease, and other age-related illnesses.With the ability to reproduce, the human population exploded, both in thefar-flung Anunnaki mining operations and in Mesopotamia. Many Adamas were takento work in the other cities growing up along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.Some were returned to mining chores, and others may have escaped into the wildor may have been sent away for population control. In any case, the Adama weresent out of E-din.The result of this human population growth and increasingly close human contactwith the Anunnaki was perhaps predictable. Genesis 6:1–4 related, “When menbegan to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, thesons of God [the Nefilim/Anunnaki] saw that the daughters of men were beautiful,and they married any of them they chose. … The Nefilim were on the earth inthose days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of menand had children by them” (New International Version). Apparently, the termNefilim was applied to both pure Anunnaki and their later hybrid offspring.Over the centuries, the Adama race, in addition to such interbreeding, was theobject of continued experimentation by the Anunnaki, which eventually resultedin changing Neanderthal to Cro-Magnon, or modern man. But some specificdeficiencies remained, including a progressive decline in the human life span.Descendants of the early Adamas lived for thousands of Earth years, thanks totheir Anunnaki genes. The extreme life spans of the more pure-blooded Anunnakirulers made them appear as immortal. The Epic of Gilgamesh states, “Only thegods live forever under the sun. / As for mankind, numbered are their days: /Whatever they achieve is but the wind!”In 2012, a group of genetic scientists, attempting to pinpoint telltale variantsin the genetic code, found surprising evidence that supported the idea ofancient genetic manipulation of human DNA. They turned up 13.4 million geneticvariants in three African groups—3 million of which had never before been seenin humans. They sequenced the genome of five individuals from three differentAfrican hunter-gatherer populations including pygmies from Cameroon andKhoesan-speaking Hadza and Sandawe from Tanzania. As expected, the scientistsfound that ninety percent of the gene flow from one species into the gene poolof another, by the repeated backcrossing of a hybrid with one of its parentspecies, traced back to the Neanderthal. But surprisingly, the other ten percentcame from what they could only describe as an unknown “foreign group.”The three selected African groups represent some of the most ancient lineages inthe world and the findings support the idea that modern humans evolved out ofAfrica. Such findings also lend support to the Sumerian account of human hybridsbeing bred by the spacefaring Anunnaki.Joshua Akey, one of the science team, told Linda Moulton Howe, reporter andeditor of the award-winning science and environment news website,www.Earthfiles.com, “[W]e can detect in the genomes and DNA of present-dayAfricans these bits of DNA that seem like they came from another (unknown)group. … We don’t know anything really about this group. … If we collect moregenome sequences from African individuals, we think we will be able to learnmore about this unknown group. … The group that we think contributed thisforeign DNA to these African populations was much more closely related toanatomically modern humans than Homo erectus. I think it is more appropriate tothink of this foreign group as about as different as Neanderthals were toCro-magnon Homo sapiens sapiens.”Akey said this foreign DNA is not found in non-Africans except for a few groupsoutside that continent. “And so what we think is the explanation for that isthat as anatomically modern humans started dispersing out of Africa, thoseindividuals that originally left Africa already contained some of that foreignDNA. And so the foreign DNA was taken out of Africa with those initial waves ofmigrations that peopled the world.” Asked if such foreign DNA might implybreeding attempts by ancient astronauts, Akey laughed and replied, “I think theclaim of extraterrestrial manipulation is such a high bar that as a scientist,you have to be skeptical about everything and that just strains the bar ofcredibility.”For early man, life was not pleasant. As bluntly stated in the Bible, Adam, Eve,and their progeny were not destined for a life of ease, but one of hard work andsurvival at the hands of their “Lords.” Sitchin stated, “The term that iscommonly translated as ‘worship’ was in fact avod—‘work.’ Ancient and biblicalman did not ‘worship’ his god; he worked for him.”Researcher Arthur Horn stated that study of the Sumerian texts made it clearthat “the Anunnaki treated their created slaves poorly, much like we treatdomestic animals we are simply exploiting—like cattle. Overt slavery in humansocieties was common from the first known civilizations until quite recently.Perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us to learn that the Anunnaki were vain, petty,cruel, incestuous, hateful—almost any negative adjective one can think of. Theevidence indicates that they worked their slaves very hard and had littlecompassion for the plight of humans. Yet, the Anunnaki eventually decided togrant humankind their first civilization, the Sumerian civilization.”LONGEVITY AND ANOTHER NOAH [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s47]The Bible often describes the very long human lives of those who came beforeNoah, such as Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Enoch, and Methuselah. Alan Alford haspointed to the fossil record and the Sumerian texts placing the birth of humansat 450,000 years ago. In order to make the Bible’s timeline make sense next tothe Sumerian and fossil timeline, Alford multiplied biblical ages by 100; hefound that the time between the birth of Adam’s son Seth and the great Flood ofNoah was 165,000 years. This number is more consistent with the Sumerianaccounts. “The Jewish people spent an extremely long exile in Egypt for 400years prior to the Exodus. Later they spent around 60 years exiled in Babylon,”explained Alford. “The Jews were thus a long way from the Sumerian origin oftheir patriarch Abraham, and had lost the knowledge of the sexagesimal system inwhich their ancestry through to Abraham was recorded.”According to the new interpretations of Sumerian tales, the first humans—theAdama—were produced about three hundred thousand years ago. After furthergenetic manipulation allowed reproduction, human women found favor with Anunnakimales, and they began interbreeding about one hundred thousand years ago. Notlong after this, a new Ice Age began, decimating the human population outsideAnunnaki control. Neanderthals slowly disappeared, while Cro-Magnons survivedonly in the Middle East. By fifty thousand years ago, some Anunnaki leadersallowed humans fathered by Anunnaki to rule in selected cities. This angeredEnlil, already incensed that some Anunnaki would mate with human women. In fact,mating in general seemed to bother Enlil—he complained that the sound of matinghumans kept him awake at night. Enlil became determined to do something aboutthe irritating humans.About twelve thousand years ago, the Anunnaki leadership realized that severeclimatic changes would occur with the imminent return of the planet Nibiru tothe vicinity of Earth. Enlil made his move. In the Anunnaki’s Great Assembly,Enlil convinced the majority to allow nature to take its course—to wipe out thehumans while the Anunnaki waited out events in evacuation ships orbiting Earth.But Enki had a plan of his own. Whether out of some affection for humans orsimply to thwart Enlil’s plans, Enki passed along the murderous “secret of thegods” to one of his most prized human assistants, the Sumerian Utnapishtim. InBabylonian legend, he was Atrahasis. The Bible called him Noah.The Akkadian version stated Utnapishtim had lived in Shuruppak, the seventh citybuilt by the Anunnaki, which has been identified as the Anunnaki medical center.It was also referred to as the city of Sud, who has been identified asNinhursag—the one who assisted Enki with the genetic creation of the Lu-lu, thefirst Earthling.Nearly all cultures have their own version of a Noah who survived the GreatFlood. He was Ziusudra to the ancient Sumerians, Nuwah to the Chinese, Cox toAztecs, Powaco to other Native Americans, Manu Yaivasata to the Hindus, Dwytachto the Celts, Noa to the natives of the Amazon, and Nu-u to the Hawaiians.Utnapishtim has been called the Sumerian Noah, and the parallels between thebiblical account of Noah and the Gilgamesh account of the Great Flood are bothstriking and obvious. Referring to the story of Noah, Sitchin stated that “thebiblical account is an edited version of the original Sumerian account. As inthe other instances, the monotheistic Bible has compressed into one Deity theroles played by several gods who were not always in accord.”According to the Sumerian texts, it was Enlil’s rival half-brother, Enki, whoinstructed Utnapishtim/Noah how to construct an ark, using readily availablebitumen to make it waterproof. The Gilgamesh version added some interestingdetails deleted from the Biblical account. For example, Enki providedUtnapishtim with an excuse to explain to his neighbors why he was building aboat—as a follower of Enki he was forced to leave the Enlil-controlled area andneeded the boat to journey to Enki’s territory in Africa.It also states that Enki instructed Utnapishtim/Noah, “Aboard ship take thou theseed of all living things. …” This instruction is most fascinating: because Enkihad been the science officer involved in the genetic engineering of humans, itmakes plausible the idea that Utnapishtim/Noah took DNA samples of all livingthings rather than a boatload of animals, insects, and plants. A ship’s cabinfull of tiny samples would be much more reasonable than a floating zoologicalpark.Scattered archaeological excavations over many years indicate that what isregarded as the Great Flood was a planetwide catastrophe, though not everyportion of the world went underwater. In fact, the Akkadian account stated thatthe Great Flood was not merely the result of heavy rains but also colossal windsthat increased in intensity, destroying buildings and rupturing dikes. These arethe kinds of conditions we might expect from a large planetary body passing byEarth.One theory holds that the gravitational forces caused by the passing of Nibirushook the Antarctic ice sheet—already unstable from the end of the last iceage—causing it to slide into the ocean and raise sea levels all over the planet.Even today, most of the original Anunnaki cities near the mouths of the Tigrisand Euphrates rivers remain deep under water and silt.Such a great catastrophe might explain why there were so few humans in the paston a planet that had housed so many great civilizations more than ten thousandyears ago—most were lost in the Great Flood. This planetwide catastrophe mightalso explain the disappearance of Beringia, the thousand-mile-long land bridgebetween Siberia and North America. During the Pleistocene ice age more than tenthousand years ago, much of Earth’s waters were contained in glaciers. Beringiahad been a dry, grassy plain, drawing both animals and humans that connectedAsia and North America across the Bering Strait. However, worldwide flooding mayhave melted great scores of ice, thus inundating Beringia.After six days and nights, the storms receded. Yet most of the land haddisappeared. Finally, as in the biblical account, the ark of Utnapishtim/Noahcame to rest atop Mount Ararat. In one version of the story, whereinUtnapishtim/Noah actually brought animals aboard his boat, he sent a dove, aswallow, and a raven from the ark. Only the raven didn’t return, indicating thatmore dry land was nearby. Noah and his family then left the ark and offered aburnt sacrifice, which drew the attention of the returning Anunnaki. An ancienttext stated that the “gods crowded like flies” around the cooking flesh.Apparently, they had developed a hunger for fresh food during their longconfinement in the ships orbiting Earth during the flood.After he realized that the humans had survived the flood, Enlil had littlechoice but to relent and allow them to remain on Earth. With flood waterssubsiding and Nibiru moving out of the solar system, the Anunnaki and thehandful of surviving humans set about reconstructing the world. But thispost-Flood world was to prove less peaceful than the previous one.Prior to the Flood, any humans not working directly for the Anunnaki wereroaming hunters or gatherers. But virtually overnight they became farmers.“Farming may be more work than hunting, judging by the available ethnographicdata and [results] in an unstable man-modified ecosystem with low diversityindex results,” noted archaeologist Kent Flannery. “Since early farmingrepresents a decision to work harder and eat more ‘third-choice’ food, I suspectthat people did it because they felt they had to, not because they wanted tofarm. Why they felt they had to, we may never know, in spite of the fact thattheir decision reshaped all the rest of human history.”SEPARATING THE HUMANS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s48]The Sumerian tablets explained why humans had to cultivate the land anddomesticate animals—because their gods demanded it. After the floods, men beganto cultivate land not in the rich soil of the river valleys but in the mountainhighlands of Mesopotamia and Palestine. Evidence of this exists even today. ASumerian text fragment recounts the story: “Enlil went up to the peak and liftedhis eyes; he looked down; there the waters filled as a sea. He looked up: therewas the mountain of the aromatic cedars. He hauled up the barley, terraced it onthe mountain. That which vegetates he hauled up, terraced the grain cereals onthe mountain.”With farming came larger and more densely crowded cities than before the Flood.Each city was ruled by one of the Anunnaki overlords, who were now beginning tobe considered gods by the humans, as they had not only survived the devastationbut had returned with their knowledge and technology.Like modern humans, certain food crops appeared to have no antecedent in Earth’sevolutionary chain. They just suddenly appeared—fully cultured—about 13,000years ago according to archaeological finds. “There is no explanation for thisbotanogenetic miracle, unless the process was not one of natural selection butof artificial manipulation,” commented Sitchin. His point may have some merit,as three critical phases of human development—farming (circa 11,000 BC), higherculture (circa 7500 BC), and civilization (circa 3800 BC)—occurred at intervalsof 3,600 years, the same period of time for a complete orbit by Nibiru.KINGS AND CONFLICT [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s49]During a post-Flood assembly of the Anunnaki/Nefilim, it was decided to dividethe Earth into four regions, with the captive human population split up withinthree of these areas—lower Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, and the Indus Valley.The Anunnaki reserved the Sinai Peninsula—their new spaceflight center followingthe Flood—as their private, or “holy,” sanctuary.Obviously, this divide-and-rule strategy for the scattered human communitiesrequired separate leaders. Thus was born the concept of kingship, human rulersspecially chosen by the Anunnaki, or “gods,” to be intermediaries betweenthemselves and the humans, whom they still considered as little better thananimals.This practice began in the Sumerian city of Kish, which Sitchin equates with thebiblical Cush. Genesis 10:8–12 relates that Cush was a grandson of Noah andfather of the legendary Nimrod, who ruled and built such cities as Babylon,Erech, and Akkad from his base in Sumer, before constructing cities in Assyria,including Nineveh. The practice of dynastic kingship based on a royal lineagetraceable to the gods has affected nations and governments up to the presentday, as evidenced by the fact that the Rothschilds of today claim kinship toNimrod.It may have been Nimrod’s attempt to thwart Enlil’s dispersion plan that led tothe Old Testament story of the Tower of Babel. This narrative began at Baalbek,believed to be a post-Flood center for Anunnaki space-shuttle operations. Themassiveness of the 1,100-ton granite block of the Trilithon, and others weighingmore than 300 tons each, buttresses the idea that this may have once been alanding or launch pad.One explanation for the trouble at Babel was that the humans there attempted toconstruct their own launch tower, apparently hoping to produce their own shem,or flying vehicle, with a view toward arguing against the breakup of humanitywith the off-world ruler, An. “Come, let us build ourselves a city with a towerthat reaches to the heavens,” they were quoted in Genesis 11:4 (NewInternational Version) as saying, “so that we may make a shem for ourselves andnot be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”An Arabic text found at Baalbek stated that Nimrod and his followers also triedto construct a shem there. “Shem, inadvertently misunderstood, was rendered bymost translators as a sign for the word ‘name.’ However, it originally signified‘that which goes up,’ ” explained author Turnage. “Sitchin designates the originof shem as Mesopotamian, originating from the word mu or the Semitic derivativeshu-mu, or sham … ‘that by which one is remembered,’ evolving into ‘name.’ Theoriginal meaning of the words, however, was originally connected with theconcept of something that flies.”“The realization that mu or shem in many Mesopotamian texts should be read notas ‘name’ but as ‘sky vehicle’ opens the way to the understanding of the truemeaning of many ancient tales, including the biblical story of the Tower ofBabel,” wrote Sitchin. Even Sitchin’s critics agree that shem or shamaim(heaven) stem from the word shamah translated as “that which is highward.”The activity at Baalbek only increased Enlil’s fear of human competition andmade him even more determined to break up the humans. His reaction may have beenreflected in Genesis 11:5–8 (Revised Standard Version), “And the Lord came downto see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built. And the Lordsaid, ‘Behold, they are one people and they have all one language; and this isonly the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to dowill now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and there confuse theirlanguage, that they may not understand one another’s speech.’ So the Lordscattered them abroad from there over the face of all the Earth and they leftoff building the city.”Soon the three branches of humankind—all descendants of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham,and Japheth—were transported to the preordained locations, where differentlanguages indeed developed over time.Alford theorized that Utnapishtim/Noah may have had wives representing separateracial groups. The offspring of these wives would have been of different races,offering an explanation for the presence of the Negroid race in Africa,Mongoloids in Asia, and Caucasoid in the Near East.Both the Sumerian texts and the Bible agree that Shem and his descendantsremained in the area encompassing Mesopotamia, Ham and his kin were taken toAfrica—here including parts of Arabia—while Japheth’s people were transported tothe Indus Valley, possibly becoming the mysterious Aryans who suddenly appearedthere in ancient times.This dispersion, accompanied by the growth of new cities with their newlyinstalled kings and increased food production, should have led to a congenialpeace. But unfortunately it appeared that the ancient “gods” were no more ableto produce lasting peace than humans.Trouble began even as the Anunnaki began to relocate their spaceflightfacilities from Sumer—now mostly underwater due to the flood—to the SinaiPeninsula at a place that came to be called El Paran (God’s Glorious Place).Mount Ararat, in what is now eastern Turkey and is reportedly where the arkfinally grounded, provided the northernmost landmark for a glide path to theAnunnaki’s Sinai landing facility. This base was located on the thirtiethparallel in the geographic center of Sinai. The southern glide path landmark wasthe two highest peaks of Mount Sinai, the higher being Mount Catherine (8,652feet above sea level) and the lower, Mount Moses (7,500 feet). What was lackingfor this glide path was a matching landmark to the west. Because that area wasflat, some researchers claim that tall markers were constructed—the greatpyramids of Giza.The editors of the Holman Bible Dictionary reported that Mount Sinai probablycame from the word meaning “shining” and was likely derived from the Babyloniangod Sin. However, Sin was simply the Semitic name for Nannar, the firstborn sonof the Anunnaki leader Enlil and sovereign of Ur, the home city of Abraham.Sin also was the Chaldean name for the moon, where the Sumerians claimed Enkifirst obtained the life-producing tissue cells or “seed” for his human hybridexperiments that remained from the clash between Nibiru and the planet Tiamat.“The enormity of this single name change on human history is beyondcomprehension,” declared author William Henry. “When the Christian interpreterscame along, they repeated the story that we were born in sin. They were entirelyaccurate in their statement. However, they omitted the fact that Sin referred tothe Moon, the source of our genetic material!” In the ensuing wars between theAnunnaki overlords, Sin was reported to have sided with the human benefactorEnki, which caused Enlil to declare those who opposed him as “sinners.”Because the Anunnaki mission control center at the Sumerian city of Nippur wasdestroyed during the Flood and because of the need for a location equidistantfrom the glide path lines, a new control center was needed. It was built atMount Moriah, translated as “Mount of Directing.” It was the site of the futureholy city of Jerusalem, long considered a most sacred place by all major Westernreligions.Eventually, new generations of the Anunnaki were on the Earth, and from theirdescendants came stories filled with intrigues, conspiracies, and outright warspitting brother against brother and sister against sister. These conflicts,rebellions, and wars would eventually involve humankind, providing their firstexposure to armed combat, which continues even today.According to the Sumerian texts, Enki’s firstborn son, Marduk, gainedsovereignty over the lands of Egypt and became known as Ra. It was his children,Shu and Tefnut, who set an example for future pharaohs by wedding each other.Their offspring, Geb and Nut, also married and were the next royal couple aswell as the parents of some of Egypt’s most famous god/rulers—Osiris, hissister/wife Isis, Seth, and Nephthys, sister of Isis.There may be a fascinating rationale for such interbreeding, as explained byresearcher Bill Putnam. He said that this was a method for exactly reproducingthe chromosomes of the pharaoh. Egyptian literature indicates that the pharaohsusually married a half sister. If a pharaoh’s son bred with the daughter of anunrelated wife (the pharaohs had several wives), the resulting match of the Xand Y chromosomes would result in reproducing an exact match of chromosomes ofthe original pharaoh. “The net effect was that the DNA of the ‘god on Earth’would be reproduced every other generation,” explained Putnam. Putnam said theywere most likely following the example of their gods, the Anunnaki, to whomreproducing the bloodline was a most necessary deed. This could help explainthis practice among humans, which continues until today within royal andbloodline families. “Princess Diana had more claim to the bloodline than PrinceCharles,” said Putnam.All this interfamily marriage led to a succession problem, solved by dividingthe country. Osiris was given Lower Egypt and Seth, mountainous Upper Egypt.Unsatisfied with his apportionment, Seth began to maneuver against Osiris, andthus began the legendary wars of ancient Egypt.In a story reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, the Sumerian stories tell of agranddaughter of Enlil named Inanna, who married the youngest son of Enki,Dumuzi, with the wary blessing of both feuding families. But when Dumuzi waskilled after being taken into custody by Enki’s firstborn son, Marduk, or Ra,for violating the Anunnaki moral code, Inanna attacked Marduk/Ra.To stop this conflict, Marduk was tried for Dumuzi’s death. As it could not beproven whether the death had been deliberate or accidental, and becauseMarduk/Ra was proclaimed a god, it was decided to sentence him to lifeimprisonment in a huge, impenetrable place whose walls reached the skies.Sitchin identified Marduk’s prison as none other than the Great Pyramid. Hewrote that his translations of the Sumerian texts explained that the curiouswell shaft within the Great Pyramid—a puzzling hand-hewed tunnel connecting thepyramid’s Descending Passage to its Ascending Passage—was dug to bypass thelarge granite stone that plugs the Ascending Passage in an attempt to rescueMarduk, who escaped but eventually returned. The capture and imprisonment of anEgyptian god are well recounted in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.Despite Marduk’s punishment, Inanna was far from satisfied, as she, too, wantedpower. The Anunnaki could satisfy her only by giving her control over anotherarea, now identified as the Indus Valley. Mounded ruins of Mohenjo-daro, thelargest city of a civilization dating back to before 2500 BC, were firstrecognized on the Indus River in southern Pakistan in 1922. Althoughthoroughly—and strangely—devastated in some prehistoric time, the baked-brickconstruction of buildings and the preplanned layout of the city indicated tosome researchers an obvious connection with Sumer. Author Alford said the citywas inhabited by a people called the Harappans, who “worshipped a sole femaledeity, whose depiction bore an amazing similarity to other images of the goddessInanna.”If this Indus goddess was indeed Inanna, she continued her quest for power,according to the Sumerian texts, eventually replacing Ninhursag among the majorAnunnaki leaders. Using a human hybrid named Sharru-Kin, Inanna carved out a newempire. The man she picked is also known as Sargon the Great. Believed to be theoffspring of a human mother and an Anunnaki father, Sargon claimed that he, likeMoses later, was placed in a sealed basket of reeds by his mother and floateddown a river to safety while a baby. Sargon went on to found the Semite Akkadiandynasty about 2200 BC, which finally encompassed all of Mesopotamia.With the fall of Sargon and the Akkadian empire, Marduk slipped from exile andattempted to regain his sovereignty over Babylon sometime before the year 2000BC. But alliances quickly shifted, and Enlil and Inanna aligned their forcesagainst Marduk and his father Enki. Marduk also faced a crushing defection fromhis son Nergal, who joined Enlil. For the Anunnaki, a true civil war was takingplace.Many are familiar with the biblical patriarch Abraham, but few realize that hemay have been involved with Anunnaki civil war. According to Zecharia Sitchin, avariety of texts clearly indicate that Abraham was far from just a wanderingHebrew, as often popularly believed, but was rather a ranking Sumerian from Ur.“Coming to Egypt, Abraham and Sarah were taken to the Pharaoh’s court; inCanaan, Abraham made treaties with the local rulers,” he noted. “This is not theimage of a nomad pillaging others’ settlements; it is the image of a personageof high standing skilled in negotiation and diplomacy.”Genesis 14:14–16 alludes to the fact that Abraham also commanded armedtroops—according to the biblical text, he took 318 “trained men” to rescue hisnephew Lot and his family from an invading coalition of armies under Marduk, asMarduk had been maneuvering to retake the Sinai space port from the north.Abraham’s warriors turned him back before he could reach the Sinai spacefacilities at El Paran. This feat later brought praise and blessing fromMelchizedek, king of Salem, as well as a covenant with Yahweh, identified asEnlil.Instead of a full retreat, Marduk stopped to sack the cities of Sodom andGomorrah in the Siddim Valley, which lies on the southern edge of the Dead Sea.Here, he defeated the kings of these cities, and took Lot prisoner before movingback north. After being rescued by Abraham, Lot returned to the area. As usuallythe case in so many wars, things got out of hand for the Anunnaki. It may havebeen at this time that the world felt the first blast of a nuclear explosion.ATOMIC WAR? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s50]Enlil and his sons, fearing Marduk’s power, persuaded Anu to allow the use ofseven mighty weapons, now believed by many to have been tantamount to tacticalnuclear missiles, against Marduk/Ra. Meanwhile, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrahfelt betrayed by their Enlilite “gods,” who had failed to protect them from theinvading coalition, so they switched their allegiance to Marduk, in essence,sealing their doom.But in honor of Abraham’s past service, Enlil decided to give him warning.Genesis 18 explains what happened next. Yahweh came to Abraham and warned himthat the cities would be destroyed because they had turned away from him. Thiswarning is evidence that the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was a plannedevent, not some unanticipated natural disaster.Such foreknowledge is also evidenced by the warning of Lot in Sodom by two“angels,” although the original Hebrew word, mal’akhim, actually only meant“emissaries,” while Webster’s 3rd New International Dictionary defines them as“messengers.” Could this mean emissaries from Enlil? Following some trouble withthe neighbors over the visitors, as recounted in Genesis 19:12–13, the pair toldLot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-laws, sons, daughters, or any one youhave in the city, bring them out of the place; for we are about to destroy thisplace, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord,and the Lord has sent us to destroy it” (Revised Standard Version).Lot and his kindred fled to the mountains as instructed, but the fiery cataclysmreached out to his own family. According to Genesis 19:26, Lot’s wife, who hadlagged behind, was turned to “a pillar of salt.” But Zecharia Sitchin noted thatthe original Sumerian word interpreted by Hebrew scribes as “salt” also meant“vapor.” Lot’s wife then was vaporized by the explosion that consumed Sodom andGomorrah. Lot and the rest of his family survived. They may have been shieldedby the crest of a hill or the like.Abraham, standing miles away in the mountains, looked down and saw a column ofdense smoke rising as if from a furnace. Could it have been mushroom shaped?Evidence that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by a nuclear explosion has comefrom many sources. The nearby Dead Sea covered the bombed cities with saltwater, perhaps under the shallow southern section of the sea below the LisanPeninsula. Oddly enough, the bottom of the Dead Sea is almost 2,500 feet belowthe level of the Mediterranean, indicating it was created by something quiteunusual and unnatural.More evidence came from hydrology research on the west bank of the Dead Sea inthe 1960s that revealed some springs in the area still register higher thannormal background radioactivity. In addition, bones found at the Ain es-SultanSpring, located on the site of ancient Jericho, contained alpha radiation,according to researchers I. M. Blake of Oxford University and J. Cynthia Weberof Harvard. Although they argued against an ancient explosion, they did notethat surrounding settlements were suddenly abandoned for several centuries about2040 BC. The Bible also hints that this radioactivity brought about sterility.In II Kings 2:19, a delegation from Jericho tells the prophet Elisha, “ … thesituation of this city is pleasant … but the water is bad and the groundbarren.”In addition to the devastation of Sodom and Gomorrah, the ancient tabletsrecount how the Sinai spaceport also was targeted for nuclear destruction,apparently to prevent it from falling into Marduk’s hands. According to Sitchin,Alford, and others, the Sinai detonation produced an unnatural scarring of thepeninsula that can still be seen from space, as well as a multitude of scorchedrocks in the area. “In the eastern Sinai, millions of blackened stones are foundstrewn for tens of miles. These stones are, without any doubt, unnatural,”reported Alford, who asserts that “photographs clearly demonstrate that therocks are blackened only on the surface.”Throughout the Middle East and beyond, there is evidence that other targets,unrecorded and as yet undiscovered, may also have experienced nucleardetonations. There are mysterious globules of fused glass and vitrified rocks atcities deep in the strata of archaeological digs at Pierrelatte in Gabon,Africa. Similar evidence attesting to the possible use of nuclear weapons in thedistant past also has been found in the Euphrates Valley, the Sahara Desert, theGobi Desert, the Mojave Desert, Scotland, Egypt (during the Old and MiddleKingdoms), and south-central Turkey.Such globules, some referred to as tektites, are thought to come frommeteorites. However, in most cases there are no visible impact craters in thevicinity. If not meteoric in origin, the problem is how they were created.John O’Keefe, writing in Scientific American, noted, “If tektites areterrestrial, it means that some process exists by which soil or common rocks canbe converted in an instant into homogeneous, water-free, bubble-free glass andbe propelled thousands of miles above the atmosphere.”Such fused material today can be found only at test sites for nuclear weapons.Moreover, scientists have found a number of ancient mining operations neardeposits of uranium.One of the most convincing indications of ancient nuclear war can be found inthe ruins of Harappa, in northeast Pakistan, and Mohenjo Daro, another majorcity of the same period, located in south-central Pakistan. Both were majorcities of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, and both seem to spring upsuddenly with no clear traces of a primitive past. Curiously, the lowest strataat Mohenjo Daro seem to indicate that the civilization was more advanced earlierin its history than later. Soapstone was replaced by common clay; crude shapesreplaced lifelike engravings, and finely glazed ceramics devolved to plainclumsy pots. “Even the bricks were inferior,” said Jonathan Gray, Australianarchaeologist and author of Dead Men’s Secrets.According to Gray, we know almost nothing about Harappa and Mohenjo Daro “exceptthat both were destroyed suddenly. In Mohenjo-Daro, in an epicenter 150 feetwide, everything was crystallized, fused or melted; 180 feet from the center thebricks are melted on one side, indicating a blast. Excavations down to thestreet level revealed 44 scattered skeletons, as if doom had come so suddenlythey could not get to their houses. All the skeletons were flattened to theground. A father, mother and child were found flattened in the street, face downand still holding hands. It has been claimed that the skeletons, after thousandsof years, are still among the most radioactive that have ever been found, on apar with those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.”An ancient Indian text called the Mahabharata describes how war broke outbetween the early “Masters” of the cities of Harappa, Mohenjo Daro, and anothercity, Kot Diji. According to the text, flying machines called vimanas—apparentlysimilar to the Anunnaki flying craft—launched a weapon that seemed to be asdevastating as an atomic bomb. Although the language differences prohibit anabsolute connection to the accounts of the Anunnaki craft and weapons, thesimilarities are provocative. The weapon was described thus:… (it was) a single projectileCharged with all the power of the Universe.An incandescent column of smoke and flameAs bright as the thousand sunsRose in all its splendor …… it was an unknown weapon,An iron thunderbolt,A gigantic messenger of death,Which reduced to ashesThe entire race of theVrishnis and the Andhakas… The corpses were so burnedAs to be unrecognizable.The hair and nails fell out;Pottery broke without apparent cause,… After a few hoursAll foodstuffs were infected …… to escape from this fireThe soldiers threw themselves in streamsTo wash themselves and their equipment.There is surprising scientific support for this account of nuclear weapons usedin India. A layer of radioactive ash was found covering a three-square-mile areain Rajasthan, ten miles west of Jodhpur, India. Archaeologist Francis Taylor,translating etchings at the site, remarked, “It’s so mind-boggling to imaginethat some civilization had nuclear technology before we did. The radioactive ashadds credibility to the ancient Indian records that describe atomic warfare.”Conventional history states that mighty Sumer simply vanished suddenly, absorbedby the new empires of Babylon and Assyria, though Sumerian texts tell a muchmore horrible story. Besides destroying a number of cities, tragic collateraldamage came about as a result of the nuclear blasts on the Sinai Peninsula—inthe fallout from the explosions, a radioactive cyclone formed and moved throughMesopotamia and on into the Indus Valley, obliterating all life and ending theSumerian civilization.According to various “lamentations” translated by the Sumerian scholar SamuelNoah Kramer, “On the land [Sumer] fell a calamity, one unknown to man; one thathad never been seen before, one which could not be withstood. A great storm fromheaven … A land-annihilating storm … An evil wind, like a rushing torrent … Abattling storm joined by scorching heat … By day it deprived the land of thebright sun, in the evening the stars did not shine … The people, terrified,could hardly breathe; the evil wind clutched them, does not grant them anotherday … Mouths were drenched with blood, heads wallowed in blood … The face wasmade pale by the Evil Wind. It caused cities to be desolated, houses to becomedesolate; stalls to become desolate, the sheepfolds to be emptied … Sumer’srivers it made flow with water that is bitter; its cultivated fields grow weeds,its pastures grow withered plants … Thus all its gods evacuated Uruk; they keptaway from it; they hid in the mountains, they escaped to the distant plains.”This one great storm of radioactive fallout annihilated the world’s first greatcivilization, leaving the bodies of the population “stacked up in heaps.”The final war in Mesopotamia was the Anunnaki’s nuclear Armageddon. Theirmillennia-old colony of Eden was blown away. One theory was that the Anunnaki,shocked by what they had wrought, retreated to an enclave in the Sinai wheremost of them made the decision to return home, perhaps leaving behind only acaretaker force or perhaps abandoning the culprits who instigated theinsurrection against the Anunnaki hierarchy.To humans, all this occurred in ancient times, more than 4,000 years ago. Iftheir time is counted by the 3,600-year revolution of their planet around oursun, then to the Anunnaki, all this would have taken place just a little morethan a year ago. Some researchers feel an Anunnaki rescue mission may still beon the way to Earth. Only time will tell if there is any truth to this.It was at this time, after the destruction of the Mesopotamian cities, that thedetailed narratives of Sumer and its gods ceased. It would be centuries beforecivilization and writing once more flourished in parts of Mesopotamia as memoryof the great cataclysm faded into vague stories of the nightmare.HISTORY BECOMES MYTHOLOGY [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s51]In Bloodline of the Holy Grail, Laurence Gardner explained how these storiesevolved into a twisted history “What actually transpired was that the originalMesopotamian writings were recorded as history. This history was later rewrittento form a base for foreign religious cults—first Judaism and then Christianity.The corrupted dogma—the new approved history—was so different from the originalwritings, the early first-hand reports were labeled ‘mythology.’ ”The term mythology stems from the Greek word mythos, simply meaning words orstories reflecting the basic values and attitudes of a people. In past ages,when the vast majority of humans were illiterate, easily understood parableswere used to educate people about history, science, and technology. During theDark Ages, when most people were taught that the Earth was flat, the wordmythology was changed by the Roman Church to mean imaginative and fanciful talesveering far from any truthfulness. This small change in semantics has causeduntold damage in current perceptions.For example, the Mesopotamian saga of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world’searliest known epic poem. It tells of the offspring of a human mother and anAnunnaki father, who, along with his nonhuman companion, Enkidu, sets out on ajourney to find the secret of immortality. The epic was thought to be merely afable at the time of its discovery in 1872. However, in 2003, Germanarchaeologists working at the site of ancient Uruk discovered what they believedto be the lost tomb of Gilgamesh. “I don’t want to say definitely it was thegrave of King Gilgamesh, but it looks very similar to that described in theepic,” Jorg Fassbinder of the Bavarian Department of Historical Monuments inMunich told the BBC.Once again, myth was turned into reality. Breakthroughs in astronomy,anthropology, archaeology, and Egyptology have only supported the theses ofErich von Däniken, Zecharia Sitchin, Alan Alford, Michael Tellinger, and manyothers. Outlandish as these concepts may appear to some, many people todaybelieve strongly that soon the revised Sumerian version of history will become awidespread and legitimate subject of study in seminaries, universities, andscience centers."},{"pageContent":"HAND-ME-DOWN CULTURES AND CONTROL [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha08]SURVIVORS OF THIS EARLY NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST FACED A PERIOD OF regression andbarbarism. The remaining humans made the best of things and began rebuildingtheir civilizations, a slow process without the overt aid of their “gods.”The humans longed for the gods’ return, and they may have expressed this longingthrough art evoking flight. Those who participated in this art were part ofsomething today called a cargo cult. Cargo cultists in certain areas ofMelanesia in the Pacific believed for years that the sky gods would bring themgoods—cargo—in “big birds.” They especially believed such prophecies were comingtrue during World War II, when American and Japanese planes dropped food andmatériel in the jungles for advancing troops. After the war, the natives builtmock airstrips and even bamboo “radios” in an effort to prepare for a return ofthe “gods.” Some of this practice continues even today.Erich von Däniken saw a cargo cult behind the famous Nazca Lines in Peru. Hespeculated that in ancient times “unknown intelligences” landed at Nazca andlaid down two runways before departing. Pre-Inca tribesmen witnessed theirarrival and later extended the two runways and added several of their own toinduce the “gods” to return. Similar etchings, which can only be discerned fromthe air, have been found in the Middle East.Following the devastation north and east of Palestine, Abraham moved his peopleto the south, where he fathered Isaac when he was one hundred years old, thanksperhaps to his hybrid genes. Isaac’s son Jacob became known as Israel, a namesoon applied to his entire people. Some believe that the name Israel is nothingless than a combination of the Egyptian gods OsirIS and RA and the Mesopotamiangod EL.For about thirty-five generations, or more than 875 years, the Israelites passedalong oral accounts of the stories of the Abraham and the Anunnaki until theyfinally wrote the stories down in Hebrew. Later, the life of Jesus Christ wasadded into the mix after the stories had been translated into Greek; the resultwas then “authorized” by a succession of rulers, including Britain’s King JamesI. We now read these stories in the form of the Bible. It also must beunderstood that the narrative above is recounted, in one form or another, in theSumerian texts uncovered only in the last 150 years, all of which predate theBible by at least 2,000 years. Just consider what current events will sound like2,000 years from now.The evidence just covered only begins to scratch the surface of the wealth ofdata now available—both archaeological and in the cuneiform tablets—thatsupports this incredible narrative with its far-reaching implications. Even theauthors and researchers studying this subject feel certain they do not have allthe facts. And while these facts probably don’t tell us the full truth of ourhistory, they most likely are pointing us in the right direction. Dr. Hornsummed it up by noting, “Let us make clear, once again, that we do not believethe ancient Sumerian and other Mesopotamian stories are ‘absolutely true’history. These stories that have come to us through thousands of years of oraltradition and writing are bound to be somewhat distorted—probably in some casesdeliberately distorted by the Anunnaki. But, I feel these ancient stories areprobably as close as we’ll come to the truth today. …”Obviously, such revision of ancient history has had and will continue to have aprofound impact on conventional science. Horn resigned as a professor ofbiological anthropology at Colorado State University in 1990 after he concludedthat the conventional explanations for man’s origins that he was teaching were“nonsense.” After much study, he, too, came to believe that extraterrestrialswere intricately involved in the origin and development of humans.If some Anunnaki remained on the devastated Earth, they would have foundthemselves marooned on a primitive world, like the astronaut portrayed byCharleston Heston in the film Planet of the Apes. Without the infrastructure tomanufacture the simplest items, they would have lost the use of their superiortechnology but not the knowledge of it, and they certainly would not have beensatisfied with simply being another member of the ape horde.But how could these ancient visitors control the much larger human population?How could one person, or even a handful of persons, control several billionpeople? Certainly not though physical control, but rather through deceit,secrecy, and the use of two historic institutions of power—first religion andlater finance. Our visitors might have also tried to control us throughfractious wars and slavery, which is practiced right up until today, althoughmost forms of direct physical slavery were abandoned in First World nations bythe mid-1800s.GIVE ME THAT OLD-TIME RELIGION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s52]Initially, our primitive ancestors most likely felt awe and reverence toward thetechnologically advanced visitors who came from the heavens. After all, whatprimitive human could fly and perform acts that must have seemed like magic? Asauthor and scientist Arthur C. Clarke once stated, “Any sufficiently advancedtechnology is indistinguishable from magic.” Despite our deference, the firsthumans thought of these visitors merely as watchers or messengers from theheavens. Only after Anunnaki leaders began to appoint rulers over humanity didthe concept of religion come into play.Rather than deal directly with the burgeoning human population, the ancient godsordained an administrative body or priesthood to pass along edicts andinstruction as well as interpret policy. These clerics got a taste of wealth andpower, a taste they were loath to relinquish. Religion soon evolved into a rigidstructure of dogmas, catechisms, tithing, and obedience.According to writers Peter Jiang and Jenny Li, some among those who studyextraterrestrial phenomena—known as exoscientists—suggest that otherextraterrestrials, who have come to Earth after the Anunnaki, have tried tomanipulate humans genetically, technologically, and also through religious dogmaand ritual. “Apparently, these extraterrestrials performed ‘great feats’ inorder to be worshipped as ‘gods.’ The reported next step was to providetechnology to these Earth humans so that these humans could create impressivelooking ‘rich’ structures of religious worship, laid with gold and other minedmineral resources, of religious worship to these extraterrestrial ‘gods.’ ”By the time of the earliest recorded human civilizations, such as Assyria andBabylonia, religions were well established and had merged with the prevailingpolitical structure. Certain civilizations had firmly established the idea thatthe clergy could be the only religious authority and that kingship was a divineright. Anointed priests who worshipped one god exhorted their followers todemonize the worshippers of the others. And anyone who failed to offerallegiance to their one true god was castigated as a blasphemer, heathen, Satanworshipper, or worse.But as the physical gods—the earlier visitors—dropped from sight, the religionsthey created turned metaphysical. The concept of God evolved from a physicalbeing to an omnipresent yet anthropomorphic supernatural entity. The elderconflicts between the ancient astronauts became a metaphor for ancient wars anda struggle between the new God and his evil counterpart, Satan. Baptist ministerand author Paul Von Ward wrote about “the development of supernatural religionin what we call the cradle of civilization, beginning less than 3,000 years ago.Here religions that grew out of absentee-[Advanced Beings]-cults that describedtheir gods as immortal, magical beings took the next step towardsupernaturalism.”Religious expert, author, and Princeton professor of religion Elaine Pagelsreceived both Rockefeller and Guggenheim fellowships and was a Mellon Fellow atthe Aspen Institute, where she later served on the board of trustees. She noted,“The earliest mention of Satan occurs in a few scattered references in theHebrew Bible. Jewish storytellers introduce a supernatural figure they call hasatan, which can be translated from Hebrew as ‘the adversary,’ or ‘the opposer,’or ‘the obstructer.’ But this supernatural ‘opposer’ never dares to oppose God.On the contrary, he is one of God’s obedient servants, his messengers, called inHebrew malakim, members of the heavenly court. Translated into Greek, malakbecomes angelos, from which we get the word ‘angel.’ ”The story of how one of God’s trusted messengers turned against him came fromvarious accounts of prebiblical Hebrew storytellers. One version was that Satanand his followers were thrown out of heaven after rebelling against orders fromtheir commander in chief. Others stated they violated policy by mating withhuman women. Yet another was that the messenger Satan refused to bow down to ayounger sibling, proclaiming, “Why do you press me? I will not worship one whois younger than I am, and inferior; I am older than he; he ought to worship me!”Whatever the origin of Satan’s rebellion, Pagels argued that Satan representedhuman hostility against other humans: “And it’s no accident that thefoundational texts of Christian tradition—the gospels of the New Testament, likethe Dead Sea Scrolls—all begin with stories of Satan contending against God’sspirit.” Pagels explained that Christians later “turned the image of Satanagainst a far wider range of targets—against the Roman empire and itsgovernment, which persecuted Christians, and then against other ‘intimateenemies’—other Christians, whom they called ‘heretics.’“What I’ve come to see is that when people invoke Satan—whether in the firstcentury or the twentieth—they have in mind not only some supernatural being, butalso some very human beings. People who say, for example, ‘Satan is trying totake over this country, but we are resisting him,’ know exactly who they have inmind, and probably can name names!”Von Ward elaborated on Pagels’s viewpoint by stating that “history makes itclear that the Hebrews had simply followed the example of their patron god. Theylabeled their opponents, foreign or domestic, Satanic worshipers of Beelzebub,Belial, and the Princes of Darkness. In return, their opponents likely shoutedtheir own epithets of ‘infidel’ (meaning ‘unfaithful to the “true” god’).”According to Von Ward, a “confluence of historical events” provided the basisfor Western supernaturalism during the Roman Empire. These events included thedevelopment of absentee nonhuman cult worship in the Middle East, the Hebrewworship of Yahweh, who was believed to be the leader of the olden gods, and thenew and compelling reformation cult of Jesus of Nazareth. Von Ward alsoattributes the rise of supernaturalism to the simultaneous rise of powerfulinstitutions—for instance, the development of Roman organizational skills andthe creation of a Christ-centered church, the power of Rome to elevate Paul’sChristian cult to the status of the state religion, and the Nicean council ofbishops that “culled from competing texts a Bible that largely excludesreferences to the reality of other [Advanced Beings] and Jesus’ humanity.”Von Ward said generations of humans slowly developed a defense mechanism oncethe ancient gods were no longer visible: “The Anunnaki had apparently decided togo about their own affairs, but humans felt bereft at being deserted. Sosupernatural theology was the defense mechanism created to help cope with thepain and anxiety of an obvious separation of humans from their gods. One of itspurposes was to assure humans that the religious rituals would either bring thedeparted gods back to Earth or reconnect the humans to them in the supernaturalrealm.”With the rise of the Roman Empire, the keepers of ancient secrets moved theirnetwork from Mesopotamia to Rome. As the Roman Empire declined, Christianitybecame a major institution. With the founding of the Roman Church, the powers ofthe ruling elite skyrocketed. Even today, David Icke and others claim, “TheRoman Catholic Church controlled by the Jesuit secret society remains at theheart of Illuminati operations.”SHOW ME THE MONEY [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s53]In early Eastern and Western cultures, rulers gained power and wealth fromreligion. Yet today, religion has waned, especially in highly developed nations.Now the favored method of control is through money.The Hebrew Mogen David, or Star of David, is of Babylonian origin and isindicative of how Babylonian/Sumerian culture was blended with Hebrew religionduring the Jews’ captivity in Babylon. And it was in the Temple at Jerusalemthat Jesus turned violent against the money changers.Matthew 21:12–13 relates, “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast outall them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of themoneychangers, and the seats of those who sold doves, And said unto them, It iswritten, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a denof thieves” (KJV).Author Joseph P. Farrell saw the development of the private issuance ofbullion-based monies both in ancient times and in various later cultures assuggesting “the evident hand of a hidden international class of bullion-brokers,war merchants, slave traders, and mining operators, for almost invariably, thepattern is the same.” The pattern involved blending finances with the prevailingreligion as if money was ordained by God.Farrell has argued that the methodology of aligning religion with money would gosomething like this: rulers could penetrate and ally with the temple, issuefalse receipts, substitute bullion for letters of credit as a measure againstthe false receipts, and thus create a facsimile of money.Thus, we arrive back at the state of issuing false receipts, only in thisinstance, these receipts are neither false nor counterfeit, they are simplyprivately created notes or promises to pay a certain amount of bullion (whichthey also control). Thus, once again the money supply is not only expanded, butthe use of such instruments actually served to allow the bullion brokers tocirculate more of such notes than they had actual bullion to redeem. The key,once again, was the sanctifying probity that the temple association gave them.With this step their power and influence over the various states which theypenetrated was almost complete, for it gave these ancient bankers, like theirmodern counterparts, the ability to expand or contract a state’s money supplyand to control their economies to create boom or bust.The power of exchanging money can be traced back to Palestine, where moneychangers were prevalent—people who exchanged the currencies of the variouscities and nations into money acceptable to the temple priests. Money thereforebecame closely associated with the temples, which also doubled as centers forthe study of astronomy and astrology.Farrell presented the thesis that modern banking magnates are merely utilizingfinancial legerdemain learned from ancient practices. The earliest bankers, whooriginally dealt in gold and silver bullion, learned that great profits could bemade by issuing written notes and credit vouchers.Today, money is increasingly mere electronic blips in a computer accessed byplastic cards at ATMs. There is nothing to back it up. Yet this illusorycurrency is loaned at interest by great institutions. As the total amount ofmoney grows, its worth decreases. This is called inflation, in effect a built-intax on the use of money. And inflation can be manipulated upward or downward bythose who control the flow of paper money or electronic blips.“The result of this whole system is massive debt at every level of societytoday,” wrote William Bramley, author of The Gods of Eden. “The banks are indebt to the depositors, and the depositors’ money is loaned out and createsindebtedness to the banks. Making this system even more akin to something out ofa maniac’s delirium is the fact that banks, like other lenders, often have theright to seize physical property if its paper money is not repaid.”Both Bramley and Farrell saw that the strategy and practices of a banking elitein existence since ancient times involve war, slavery (whether physical orfinancial), usurpation of the money-creating power of the state, the inventionof debt-as-money, and economic cycles coupled with astrology.But in order to exert control over such a system, a banking elite would haverequired long-distance communication and the use of basic technology in order toconstruct a worldwide financial network. It has been well documented how earlybanking dynasties, such as the Medicis and Rothschilds, indeed were dependent onelaborate and effective communication systems. And both families exercised powerover kings and monarchs, even selecting the pope.There are examples of communication technology that could have been used in thepast to simulate miracles and messages from divine beings. Konstantin Meyl, whoteaches electronics and alternative energy technology at the University ofApplied Sciences in Furtwangen, Germany, has built on the work of Nikola Teslain describing how energy—including sound waves—can be transferred without wiresvia scalar waves, multidimensional standing-wave patterns that exist within theuniversal unified energy field. G. Patrick Flanagan, author of Pyramid Power,has developed a device called a neurophone, which can carry sound to the brainwithout the use of the auditory system. Using “hyperspacial nested modulation”technology, this device takes a complex signal, such as the sound of anorchestra, and electrically processes it into square waves approximating humanbrain waves. After further processing, the waves are carried through zirconiumtitanate electrodes embedded in acrylic plastic tiles placed on the skinanywhere on the body. A person using a neurophone device can “hear” music andspeech without the use of the ears. The neurophone has been used experimentallyin communicating with dolphins, and further experimentation has shown thatscalar-wave sound like radio waves may be discernible without the need forphysical contact.Such existing technology led Meyl to theorize that many ancient temples wereconstructed in such a way as to create a communication system. “The temples inantiquity were all shortwave broadcasting stations,” bluntly stated Meyl in his2003 book Scalar Waves: From an Extended Vortex and Field Theory to a Technical,Biological, and Historical Use of Longitudinal Waves. He said the temples werepowered by ambient Earth electromagnetic energy as described by MichaelTellinger. Also they were constructed in such a manner as to harness energy fromthe sun, as well as neutrino radiation from the planets.Studying the floor plans of the Greek temples of Zeus, Athena, Hera, and Apolloand even the Pantheon in Rome, Meyl presents a compelling argument that thedimensions of such sites show an uncanny geometric resemblance based on thegolden ratio, an irrational (nonfractional) number, a mathematical constant usedby many early artists and architects, who referred to such designs as sacredgeometry. So by constructing edifices using certain rigid mathematical formulasand by utilizing ambient radiation, knowledgeable insiders within the bankingelite were able to communicate at great distances via both aural and psychicmeans.According to Meyl, old accounts have proved that this type of communicationexisted, yet those translating the accounts garbled the translations becausethey didn’t understand the technology being discussed. For instance, those whohave translated accounts of oracles, angelic voices, and prophecies may haveactually meant that a receiver was in use. One old Latin text, for example,stated, “They sent by courier to the emperor in Rome and got for an answer … Theanswer of the emperor namely arrived at the squad at the latest in the followingnight.” Meyl has posited that the correct translation should read, “They cabled”or “They broadcast to the emperor in Rome and got for an answer …” Meylcontinued, “Such a big empire as the Roman Empire actually could only be reignedby means of efficient communication. Cicero coined the word: ‘We have conqueredthe people of the Earth owing to our broadcasting technology.’ … If engineers,however, rework the incorrect translations … much direct evidence existsconcerning the practical use of this technology.” Like many ancientphilosophers, Cicero also wrote that the occult mysteries had more to do withnatural science than with religion.Bramley saw war as another important control mechanism. “War can be an effectivetool for maintaining social and political control over a large population,” hewrote. “A state of war [including an undeclared one, such as the War on Drugs orWar on Terrorism] can also be used to encourage populations to think in waysthat they would not otherwise do, and to accept the formation of institutionsthat they would normally reject. The longer a nation involves itself in wars,the more entrenched those institutions and ways of thinking will become.”With the control mechanisms of war, religion, and finance firmly in place andcoupled with an effective communication system, the stage was set forsubjugation of humanity by a relative handful of persons, all traceable to theoriginal civilizations with their narratives of sky gods bringing knowledge andtechnology.Much detail concerning the ancient Sumerians and their Anunnaki overlords hasbeen kept from the general public, although in recent years some of thismaterial has begun to break through into the corporate mass media. The HistoryChannel’s popular program Ancient Aliens broke many barriers in bringing theconcept of extraterrestrials on Earth in the past to the public.As the once great Sumerian culture disappeared into history, vestiges of thiscivilization rose and fell in the Near East. The empires of Akkad, Assyria,Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Egypt came to the fore. Their histories are bothwell documented and well known. Lesser known is that they were merelyhand-me-down cultures based on the religion and technology of the much oldercivilization of Sumer. And behind their history lurked personages with a desireto rule humanity.ANCIENT EGYPT [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s54]Egypt was ruled by pharaohs who, like other kings, jealously guarded theirbloodline. The bloodlines of these Egyptian kings carried the DNA closest tothat of the Anunnaki overlords, and it was this DNA that helped them claim theirkingship. This custom had been passed down from generation to generation, eventhough the bloodline of the kings was probably diluted after wars or marriagestook place or after the kings bred with commoners.Although no one in the past had a clear understanding of extraterrestrial life,there are many tantalizing clues hinting at past visitations, found inengravings, jewelry, and statuary. In the small Egyptian village of Nazletel-Samaan, located near the pyramids and the Giza Plateau, an ancient gate holdsin its keystone a carving of a small alien “gray.” The figure was carved from atwo-and-a-half-ton block of marble, and the doorway’s base was fashioned fromblocks made from an aggregate of small, round crushed stones and sand, thestones in which have been dubbed “coins” by the villagers.Few researchers have bothered to visit this poor neighborhood, nestled justbeyond the paws of the Sphinx. Villagers claim that the diminutive figure on thegate has been there for as long as anyone remembers, yet they have noexplanation or even an oral history concerning it. Lions or cats, long known assymbols of protection, were carved on both sides of the gate. Some say designson the gate resemble those of the Mayans. Others say it appears to bePhoenician. Recently the doorway was demolished to be replaced by a modernentrance, but the ET carving was hidden away for safekeeping.As the blocks comprising the doorway were of the same stone and craftsmanship asseen on the Great Pyramid, many others believe it dates back to the pyramid’sconstruction. Until modern times, the area where the village is now located wascovered with sand, which may explain why the doorway was so well preserved. Thisdoorway was not an anomaly. There are other ancient doorways in Nazlet el-Samaanwith keystones, as well as carved marble stairways and columns, most now brokeninto pieces. Many of these ancient pieces have been plastered over by thevillagers who now live there and who seek to protect the pieces from those whowish to destroy anything that does not fit with official and conventionalEgyptian history.Some Egyptian locals claim that in many areas of Cairo there are entrances to alabyrinth of tunnels running beneath the Giza Plateau. Egyptian authoritiescontinue to discount accounts of such tunnels. In 2009, six Egyptians died ofsuffocation while digging down to the tunnel system. They had visited theunderground tunnels previously but died when their shaft collapsed. AnnieDeRiso, news director of The Common Sense Show radio program, hosted by DaveHodges, said she climbed down into the tunnels in 2006. In them, she and othersfound the same aggregate of sand and round, coinlike-stone that composed the“alien” gate, as well as fragments of glass and the bones of a giant humanoid.Erhan Altunay, who said he, too, had visited the tunnels under the Giza Plateau,recalled,During one of my visits to Egypt (in 1996, I think) I was guided by a localguide (although I hate to be disturbed by the guides around), and he said hewould show something special if I gave him $20. We went to a special area nearto the Pyramids but at the bottom of the plateau where the Pyramids aresituated. We entered through a hole by paying $5 to the guard there and I wasextremely surprised to see a lot of gates opening to endless tunnels. I saw alsomany statues, as you may see in the pictures. (It is strictly forbidden to takepictures, but you may take some if you pay the guard, as I did.) It seems to methat these tunnels are very old but also used in later times as I saw somesarcophagi which seem to be from very late periods. I’ve been in Egypt severaltimes but this was the first and the last time I saw those tunnels, as it wasforbidden to go there.In 1978, ground-penetrating radar was used to map what was described as “anextraordinary subterranean complex beneath the Egyptian pyramids.” With theagreement of then president Anwar Sadat, secret excavations were conducted forthe next three decades. The excavations were colloquially known as the Gizaproject. In a private screening many years after the project began, one of thescientists reportedly involved, James J. Hurtak, showed a film of the findings.According to one participant, Paul White, Hurtak’s film depicted “a vastmegalithic metropolis, 15,000 years old, reaching several levels below the Gizaplateau.” The film depicted underground waterways, massive chambers, andenormous statues carved in situ, the size of those in the Valley of the Nile.White has called this underground sprawl the City of the Gods, stating, “It isthe legacy of a civilisation and a technology beyond our own.”Dr. Hurtak, who commands an international following, compared the discovery ofthe underground city with its miles of tunnels to contact with an advancedextraterrestrial culture. He said the sprawling city was the work of Atlanteans,which he described as the Fourth Root Culture. To Hurtak, this discovery wasunequivocal evidence that all languages, cultures, and religions can be tracedback to a single common source, which he called the Parent Civilization.Adding to the mystery of the Giza underground labyrinth are many otherdisturbing oddities, which can still be found amid Egyptian ruins. In 2010,seventeen new pyramids were found through the use of NASA satellite imaging.Images found on the ceiling beams of the three-thousand-year-old New KingdomTemple of Seti at Abydos appear to depict a modern helicopter, submarine,airplane, and hovercraft. The carvings were discovered only recently when afront piece fell from the beam. At Saqqara, Egypt, within the tomb of the sageand philosopher Ptahhotep, author of an extant book of advice to princes,hieroglyphics describe servants offering food to the deceased, who servedPharaoh Djedkare Isesi during his reign, part of the Fifth Dynasty, which lastedfrom 2494 until 2345 BC. Amazingly, at the bottom is a figure that resemblesnothing less than a small alien “gray” as described by so many people who claimUFO contact experiences.CLASSICAL GREECE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s55]Egypt has long held the fascination of scientists, archaeologists, adventurers,moviemakers, and others, but ancient Greece has always been considered thefoundation of Western culture. Greece was settled around 3500 BC. Its name comesfrom the Greek word graikoi, referring to the original inhabitants of Dodona,which held the oldest known shrine to the god of thunder, Zeus. Perhaps earlyinhabitants migrated from the decaying Minoan civilization on Crete.By the sixth century BC, Greek power had become concentrated in the two citystates of Athens and Sparta. After the Greeks twice defeated Persian invasions,Athens became the center of power and during the next few centuries led thenation’s advancement in science, the arts, and philosophy.Exhausted by war against each other, Athens and Sparta declined during thefourth century BC, and the power vacuum was filled by Philip of Macedon, whoseson Alexander the Great, born in 356 BC, plundered Greece, then Persia, Syria,Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylonia, and parts of India before dying in Babylon at theage of thirty-three. During his rule of Egypt, he founded the city ofAlexandria, which became the ancient world’s most important center forscientific and literary studies, as well as for the transmission of esoterictraditions. Alexander was a student of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who hadbeen taught by Plato, who had learned from Socrates. By 146 BC, Greece wasdominated by Rome. Centuries later, after the Roman Empire had been divided intoeastern and western halves and the western empire had fallen, Greece became partof the Byzantine Empire.GREEK GODS FROM EGYPT [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s56]A close study of mythology from around the world reveals striking similaritiesamong many cultures and their beliefs in ancient gods. Legends from differentpeoples living in all corners of the Earth seem to tell essentially the samestory—in the distant past, certain individuals with “godlike” powers moldedmankind into a civilized state following a period of cataclysmic upheaval.While there is no agreement on the specific connections among the “gods,” due tothe large amount of incidental material that has grown up around the stories, ageneral comparison of mythologies demonstrates common features that appear to gobeyond coincidence and reveal the striking similarities among all versions ofthe ancient “gods.” The names changed with different languages, but thecharacteristics remained the same.[../images/185-1.jpg]It is important to understand that early on the Sumerians never considered, norreferred to, the beings who brought them knowledge as “gods.” This was a laterinterpretation by the Romans and Greeks, who fashioned their own gods after theearlier traditions of the Egyptians and earlier civilizations.All references to these gods carry similar attributes, which correspond to otherworlds beyond the Earth and also convey the idea of influences over humanity asfound in astrology, the origin of which is so ancient as to be unknown.The Greek Herodotus, the “father of history,” has been proven truthful in hisaccounts. The Scythian city Gelonus was a privileged trading partner to theGreeks until conquered by Alexander. Herodotus’s description of this populationcenter as being a thousand times larger than Troy was widely disbelieved untilit was rediscovered in 1975.Herodotus made it quite clear that the Greek gods, and the rites attributed tothem, all came from Egypt, conquered by Alexander in 332 BC. The Egyptian godssimply assumed new names when translated into the Greek language. One clearexample is the Greek term for their pantheon of gods, the Titans, who ruled theearth prior to an insurrection. The ruler of the Titans was Cronos, who has beenidentified as the Anunnaki Anu. He was succeeded by his son Zeus, who has beencompared to the Sumerian overlord Enlil. Furthermore, the Titans have alwaysbeen associated with the various planets, indicating a strong connection to theheavens, and in the Sumerian cuneiform tablets, the word for “those who live inthe heavens” is Ti-ta-an.Herodotus also noted the extreme longevity of ancient Egyptian rulers and alsowrote that prior to eleven thousand years ago living “gods” had resided amongthe humans. “Thus far I have spoken on the authority of the Egyptians and theirpriests. They declare that from their first king to this last-mentioned monarch,the priest of Vulcan, was a period of three hundred and forty-one generations;such, at least, they say, was the number both of their kings, and of theirhigh-priests, during this interval,” wrote Herodotus in Book 2 of his Histories.“Now three hundred generations of men make ten thousand years, three generationsfilling up the century. … However, in the times anterior to [the human kings] itwas otherwise; then Egypt had gods for its rulers, who dwelt upon the earth withmen, one being always supreme above the rest. The last of these was Horus, theson of Osiris, called by the Greeks Apollo.” As indicated in the comparisonchart, Osiris was the Egyptian name for the Anunnaki god Enki, meaning that hisson, Horus, would have been Marduk to the Sumerians and Ares to the Greeks, whowas the god of war. Is it just coincidence that Marduk began the great civil warbetween the Anunnaki?Close to twenty ancient buildings in southern Greece look like pyramids and showevidence of Egyptian influence. One impressive pyramid is located near theeastern Peloponnesian village of Hellenikon in Argolis, but for the most part,the structures are largely ruins. Some speculate that in the past the edificeswere torn down and used as construction materials for churches and for limeproduction.It appears that the Greek pyramids, like the Great Pyramid, were aligned withheavenly bodies. In the 1990s, archaeologists with the Archaeological Museum ofNauplion found the astronomical orientation of the long entrance corridor of theHellenikon pyramid probably aligned with Orion’s Belt between the years2400–2000 BC. By measuring accumulated radiation using a method calledthermoluminescence, archaeologists were able to date scrapings back past 3,000BC, making them older than similar Egyptian structures.Athletes and musicians gathered every few years in the Greek city of Delphi tocompete in the Pythian Games, which may have begun even earlier than theOlympics, which according to tradition began in 776 BC. Delphi was also home tothe Oracle of Delphi, a famed figure in classical Greek mythology. There aremysterious connections between this sacred site and other sites in Greece, suchas the Acropolis of Athens, where the Parthenon is located.In Odyssey of the Gods, an account of extraterrestrial contact in ancientGreece, Erich von Däniken writes of an experience with Theophanias Manias, aGreek Air Force officer who had studied topography at the National TechnicalUniversity of Athens.He [Manias] took a pair of compasses, placed the point on Delphi and drew acircle through the Acropolis. Strange to say, the circumference of the circlealso touched Argos and Olympia. These places were equal distances from eachother. A strange coincidence, thought Colonel Manias, and then placed thecompass point on Knossos at Crete. The circumference of this circle also touchedSparta and Epidaurus—strange! Colonel Manias continued. When the center wasDelos, Thebes and Izmir lay on the circumference; when the center was Paros, itwas Knossos and Chalcis; when the center was Sparta, Mycenae and the oracle siteof Trofonion were on the circumference.Both Manias and von Daniken saw in these configurations a repetition of thepreviously described golden ratio indicating the influence of ancient knowledge.“In ancient Greece many such triangles can be drawn, and always with twoproportions in regard to the length of their sides,” noted von Daniken. “Suchtriangles joining cult sites cannot just arise by chance.”Maurice Chatelain has written of sacred sites connected with a perfection thatcould only have been accomplished from the vantage point of outer space. Hedescribed thirteen mystical sites within a 450-mile radius of the long-veneratedGreek island of Delos connected by straight lines to produce a perfect MalteseCross, later the emblem of the Knights Templar. Delos has always been consideredone of ancient Greece’s most holy sites, although no one has ever known exactlywhy. In Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space, Chatelain wrote, “What interests usnow is how and why such a gigantic pattern was marked on the Aegean andsurrounding lands. I do not believe that even today’s land surveyors could soprecisely mark such a gigantic figure of over 360 miles jumping from island toisland and stretching over sea and mountains. Except from high up in the airthis Maltese Cross would not be visible.”Hesiod, a Greek poet who lived about 700 BC, wrote extensively of the gods inhis Theogony, a synthesis of stories concerning the Greek gods. He wrote ofconflicts and wars, even between Zeus (Enlil in Sumerian) and his father Cronos(the sky god Anu in Sumerian). He may have been describing thunderous Anunnakisky god Enlil and his more beneficent half-brother Enki when he wrote, “Theglowing Sun never looks upon them with his beams, neither as he goes up intoheaven, nor as he comes down from heaven. And the former of them roamspeacefully over the earth and the sea’s broad back and is kindly to men; but theother has a heart of iron, and his spirit within him is pitiless as bronze:whomsoever of men he has once seized he holds fast: and he is hateful even tothe deathless gods.”In writing of the wars between the gods, Hesiod spoke of their flying chariotsand may have even described ancient atomic weapons when he wrote, “And flameshot forth from the thunder-stricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount,when he was smitten. A great part of huge earth was scorched by the terriblevapour and melted as tin melts when heated by men’s art in channeled crucibles;or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is softened by glowing fire inmountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of Hephaestus.Even so, then, the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire.” Hesiod goes tosome length to detail the many wives of Zeus and the spreading of his bloodlinefollowing the wars of the gods.Many centuries after Hesiod, Plato wrote in the Statesman that Earth’s polesshifted after the gods left the Earth.In the fulness of time, when the change was to take place, and the earth-bornrace had all perished, and every soul had completed its proper cycle of birthsand been sown in the earth her appointed number of times, the pilot of theuniverse let the helm go, and retired to his place of view; and then Fate andinnate desire reversed the motion of the world. Then also all the inferiordeities who share the rule of the supreme power, being informed of what washappening, let go the parts of the world which were under their control. And theworld turning round with a sudden shock, being impelled in an opposite directionfrom beginning to end, was shaken by a mighty earthquake, which wrought a newdestruction of all manner of animals.The classical Greeks also wrote of leaders and rulers who, much like theAnunnaki, were the offspring of humans and gods. In the oldest telling of thestory of Jason and the Argonauts, Pindar’s Pythian Ode number 4, elevenadventurers, including Jason, all were said to have been descendants from theancient gods.Beyond the overlaps between Sumerian and Greek mythology and the influence theGreeks have had on our culture, it’s possible that the Greeks and their gods areaffecting us in ways we might never have imagined. Recently, a man knownpseudonymously as Ted Connors, who worked with a Department of Defensesubcontracting firm in Alabama, recounted how one morning in 2007 he saw a largemetallic hubcap next to a tree with long wires stretching upward. Suddenly theobject rose and disappeared in midair.Connors was among several people who were reporting seeing such “spider drones.”Later in the year, Connors found himself having disturbing dreams about hisencounter. When he revisited the tree, he found that it had been cut down. As hesat nearby contemplating, he began to feel an electrostatic charge throughouthis body and started to receive what he thought were telepathic messages frombeings from another planet. They first explained that the object Connors saw wasa drone probing Earth for information. They said they were from a planet calledOltissis, the twenty-third planet in their star system, one that has four moons.The probe came through a “tear” in time and space, which was repaired upon itsreturn. Connors was told that our interpretation of time and space is incorrect.“All is infinite,” they explained, adding that we would not understand their“ethos,” a Greek word for the character or nature of a people.As ethos is derived from the Greek and Oltissis sounds Greek, Connors wrote, “Myfeeling is these [telepathic beings] are the ancient Greeks. These [fromOltissis] are the ones who came here before Earth’s historic timeline. They arethe Greek gods.”Connors’s tale might be written off as a delusion or fabrication, except for afurther development. Because he connected his experience to the Greek gods,Connors visited a local library for a book on ancient Greece and stumbled acrossone entitled Ancient Greek Gods and Lore Revisited. It was copyrighted 1962 andwas by an author whose name Connors remembers as Fredrico Ionnides. In this bookhe said he found three references to Oltissis. Apparently one referencementioned Oltissis as a historic Greek pleasure palace. He said he left the bookon his car seat, as he intended to read it when he had time.Two days later, Connors said he was surprised to be called into his boss’soffice. He was even more surprised to find two men there who presentedidentification showing they were from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)and the National Security Agency (NSA). The pair asked him about the librarybook he had obtained and said curtly, “We need to have that book.” When askedwhy, the one from DHS replied it was a national security matter and asked ifConnors was aware of the PATRIOT Act.Connors’s boss said brusquely, “Go get the book!” He immediately retrieved thebook from his car and turned it over to the two men, asking, “How will I get thebook back?”“We will contact you,” they replied.Connors was flabbergasted and never thought to ask the men how they knew he hadchecked out this book from the library or why a book on ancient Greek gods wouldhave any application to national security. Since he had mentioned the book’stitle in an e-mail to a friend, Connors suspected the agents learned of itthrough e-mail interception, and he suspected that the Greek god connection,whatever it may be, is a serious matter to certain federal authorities. “Ifthere is one thing I’m sure of at this point in time [it] is that—and this iswhat I got from the first message I received—is that this is very important tomankind—not to governments—not to leaders—not to power brokers—but to mankind,”he told journalist Linda Moulton Howe.John Coleman, a veteran best-selling conspiracy author and a self-proclaimedformer MI6 agent, provided connective tissue bringing the tales of Greek godsright up to date. In his book on the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations,Coleman said in modern America a “closely knit group of social psychologists,pollsters and media manipulators” is presided over by an elite group of powerfulpatrons, known as the Committee of 300 or, more significantly, “the Gods ofOlympus.”POWER PASSES TO ROME [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s57]After the Greeks came the Romans. The Roman civilization is said to have beenfounded in 753 BC by Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of the Trojan leaderAeneas, who fled to Italy with other refugees following the fall of Troy inmodern-day Turkey. It was said Aeneas was the son of the Greek goddessAphrodite, and with his death, at his mother’s request, he was deified as thegod Jupiter Indiges. Venus, the goddess of beauty, sex, fertility, and victory,was the Roman counterpart of Aphrodite. Her Anunnaki counterpart would have beenInanna. Such connections indicate the ongoing cult worship that began in Sumerand then passed through Egypt and Greece.About 80 BC, General Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, better known simply as Sulla,founded a college in Rome dedicated to the Egyptian goddess Isis. However, Isisworship was discouraged by the Roman consuls, who did not want to share controlover the population. The worship of Isis at Rome continued to be suppressed by asuccession of decrees until the reign of Caligula.In 212 BC, a different man, Gaius Sulla, an ardent worshipper of Apollo,organized the first of the annual Ludi Apollinares, or Games of Apollo, honoringthe Greek god whose counterparts were Osiris and Enki. The later warlord, SullaFelix, was known to wear a small golden image of Apollo into battle. In manyways, Roman culture was merely the latest incarnation of Sumer, bringing with itmany of the older centralized religious and political structures.The Roman Empire was formed in 27 BC after Julius Caesar’s nephew Octavian(Caesar Augustus) had emerged victorious from a series of ruinous civil wars,first primarily between Julius Caesar and his former ally Pompey, and thenbetween Octavian and his former ally Mark Antony. Before his assassination in 44BC by a group of senators hoping to restore the republic, Julius Caesar had seento it that his name became so popular that it was used as a title for subsequentrulers; soon the title Caesar evolved from being a family name of the Julianclan of Rome to a title held by a Roman emperor. The name has lived on in theGerman word kaiser and the Russian title czar.At the height of its power in about AD 117, the empire commanded most of theWestern world. Like Greece and the United States, Rome began as a democraticrepublic but evolved into a voracious and aggressive empire ruled by asuccession of tyrannical Caesars, its people distracted by bread andcircuses—government-sponsored free food and weekly gladiatorial spectacles inthe various coliseums.However, after the death (possibly another assassination) of the last paganemperor, Julian the Apostate, the true ruling power was the Roman Church,collector of tithes and lender of money to the government. As the power of thelater Roman state rested on the power of the Church, it is instructive to reviewthe rise of Christianity.In the time of Jesus of Nazareth, Jews in Palestine were fragmented among theclerical and politically powerful Pharisees, the pious Sadducees, and theunconventional Essenes. Moreover, the interpretations of the Old Testament foundin the Dead Sea Scrolls illuminate the ways in which the interpretations ofJames and the Jerusalem Christians devoted to the teachings of Jesus differedfrom those of Paul and his followers outside Palestine. It is interesting tonote that in the Scriptures Jesus condemned both the Pharisees and Sadducees butpointedly ignored the Essenes, leading many to believe he favored the Essenephilosophies.As leaders of the Jerusalem church, Jesus’s brother James and Mary Magdalenewere at odds with Paul, who was bringing his version of Christianity to thegentiles to the north. There were immense squabbles over the most minute issues.In Galatians 5:12, Paul had become so exasperated with a continuing argumentover circumcision that he expressed the hope that those initiating thecontroversy would emasculate themselves.Bible scholar and former intelligence analyst Patricia G. Eddy wrote, “The firstJewish Christians believed that obeying all of the stringent Jewish religiouslaws, including circumcision and eating only Kosher food, were necessary forsalvation.” Yet according to Eddy, “Paul preached that salvation could beattained through faith and that the Jewish religious laws should not be allowedto impede people from becoming Christians. Paul’s view eventually won out, asmore and more gentiles converted to Christianity. By the third century, theyoutnumbered the Jewish Christians by a large margin, defined Christianityaccording to Paul’s theology, and began castigating the original JewishChristians as heretics.”By the middle of the second century, Irenaeus, the Bishop of Lyons, wascondemning the followers of Jesus and James as heretics. These followers wereknown as Nazarenes, or the poor. The author Laurence Gardner noted that Irenaeuscomplained that these Nazarenes “reject the Pauline epistles and they reject theapostle Paul, calling him an apostate [rejecter] of the Law … the Nazarenes …denounced Paul as a ‘renegade’ and a ‘false apostle,’ claiming that his‘idolatrous writings’ should be ‘rejected altogether.’ ”Elaine Pagels wrote that “diverse forms of Christianity flourished in the earlyyears of the Christian movement. Hundreds of rival teachers all claimed to teachthe ‘true doctrine of Christ’ and denounced one another as frauds. Christians inchurches scattered from Asia Minor to Greece, Jerusalem, and Rome split intofactions, arguing over church leadership. All claimed to represent ‘theauthentic tradition.’ ”After becoming an established institution, the Roman Church quickly gainedwealth and power. It derived a great deal of power from collecting tithes andlending money to the government. “Far above the wrangling in the local churchessat the Roman Church, unconcerned, untroubled, and probably, uncomprehending,”Patricia Eddy wrote, adding that the Church at this time was primarilyconcentrating on missionary work in Europe, an activity which paid unexpectedbenefits. “Unwittingly, the Christianization of these heathen ultimately savedthe Roman Church because the barbarians and their priests regarded the RomanChurch as the authority for their religious beliefs. When the barbarians overranRome, the Roman Church was spared. …”Though spared by the barbarians, the Church still had to contend with a varietyof sects, all with their own version of Christianity. Church control wasmaintained predominantly by fear of God’s wrath as evoked by the priesthood. Ifthat failed, there was always force.And all of the Church’s machinations were said to be supported by biblicalscripture, which had been edited numerous times to eliminate certain messagesthat contradicted Church dogma. Editing, or redactions, as they areeuphemistically called, over the years has led to errors in our translations ofthe Bible, which in turn have led some to misunderstandings over modern terms,such as flight, or when it came to secret codes hidden within its language. TheEssenes of Jesus’s time produced literature containing their own intricate codesand allegories to protect their knowledge from the uninitiated as well as fromthe Roman authorities. For example, when writing about the Romans, they used theterm Kittim, but this word was often misinterpreted to refer to the ancientChaldeans of Mesopotamia or some of the Greek islands.In addition, according to C. L. Turnage, some Bible codes and symbols referredto multiple deities. “These coded references pointed the way toward anunderstanding that such beings were the gods, or Elohim, of the Bible, whoseworship began in Sumer, and who ultimately originated on another world.”The conflicts both within and outside of Christianity were settled by the Romanemperor Constantine in a compromise to gain power. “Apart from various culticbeliefs, the Romans had worshipped the Emperors in their capacity as godsdescended from others like Neptune and Jupiter,” explained author LaurenceGardner. “At the Council of Arles in 314, Constantine retained his own divinestatus by introducing the omnipotent God of the Christians as his personalsponsor. He then dealt with the anomalies of doctrine by replacing certainaspects of Christian ritual with the familiar pagan traditions of sun worship,together with other teachings of Syrian and Persian origin. In short, the newreligion of the Roman Church was constructed as a ‘hybrid’ to appease allinfluential factions. By this means, Constantine looked towards a common andunified ‘world’ religion—Catholic meaning universal—with himself at its head.”Once Christianity became the accepted religion of the empire, pagan holidayswere expropriated. Saturnalia, for example, was the winter festival in honor ofthe god Saturn, the equivalent of the Sumerian god of the heavens, Anu, and theEgyptian god Amen-Ra (known to the Greeks as Cronos). Saturnalia was merely alatter-day extension of the Greek festival of Kronia, a remembrance of the“Golden Days” when Cronos ruled the world. By the end of the republic, it hadevolved into a gay time of gift-giving, lighting candles, feasting, and generalfrivolities for the entire population, including slaves. But when Christianityarrived, the Roman rulers found it difficult to stamp out this holiday, so theChurch simply announced that it was celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, anobservance that has been carried forward to this day as Christ Mass, orChristmas.The church’s co-optation of Christianity was sealed at the Council of Nicaea inAD 325. During the council, the priest Arius was beaten and tossed out becausehe and his followers believed that only God created everything and thereforeJesus was not God but simply a heavenly inspired teacher. His followers, theArians, were banished from the Church, and the Nicene Creed was established,which formally defined God as a deity of three equal and coexisting parts—theFather, Son, and Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost.One year later, Constantine ordered the confiscation and destruction of allworks that questioned the newly constructed orthodoxy and then opened theLateran Palace, which was a precursor of the Vatican, to the Bishop of Rome. In331, the emperor ordered new copies made of Christian texts, most of which hadbeen lost or destroyed during the previous persecutions. The resulting editingincluded alterations that have become the foundation of modern Christianity.BOOK BURNING [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s58]Although history lavishes praise on the Greek and Roman empires for the advancesthey brought in military strategies, construction, and sanitation, scantattention has been paid to the destruction of ancient sacred sites andindigenous cultures as these empires spread across the world.Ancient knowledge and history were forgotten by the masses, often because theruling classes destroyed libraries and historical records. Only a few of Homer’spoems survived the destruction of his works by the Greek tyrant Pisistratus inAthens. Nothing survived the destruction of the Egyptian library in the Templeof Ptah in Memphis. Likewise, an estimated two hundred thousand volumes ofpriceless works disappeared with the destruction of the library of Pergamum inAsia Minor.When the Romans leveled the city of Carthage in their drive for world conquest,they destroyed a library said to have contained more than five hundred thousandvolumes. Then came Julius Caesar, whose war against Egypt resulted in the lossof the great library at Alexandria, considered the greatest collection of booksin antiquity. With the loss of the Serapeum and the Bruchion branches of thatlibrary, a total of up to seven hundred thousand volumes of accumulatedknowledge went up in flames.European libraries also suffered under the Romans and later from zealousChristians. Between the sacking of Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and theCatholic Inquisition (1137–1825), an inestimable number of ancient works wereirretrievably lost.Collections in Asia fared little better, as Emperor Ch’in Shih Huang Ti orderedall histories of ancient China burned just before he died in 210 BC.“Because of these tragedies we have to depend on disconnected fragments, casualpassages and meager accounts,” lamented Australian author Andrew Tomas. “Ourdistant past is a vacuum filled at random with tablets, parchments, statues,paintings, and various artifacts. The history of science would appear totallydifferent were the book collection of Alexandria intact today.”Always this destruction was done in the name of God or the people. In Rome, theofficial slogan was Senatus populus quis Romanus, meaning the Senate(government) and the Roman people are one, or synonymous. It was an early andeerie forerunner of the German Nazi slogan Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer, orOne people, one Empire, one Leader.The book burning of the Nazis is well known, but such destruction of knowledgedid not stop with the end of World War II. In Iraq, the central al-AwqafLibrary, founded in 1920, contained 45,000 rare books and more than 6,000documents from the Ottoman Empire. At the onset of the U.S. invasion, arsonistsset fire to the building in April 2003. Although the staff managed to save 5,250items, including a collection of older Korans, all else was lost. The firespread, destroying all 175,000 books and manuscripts at the library of theUniversity of Baghdad’s College of Art. The entire library at the University ofBasra was reduced to ash, and the Central Public Library in Basra lost 100percent of its collection. Also lost in the invasion and subsequent occupationwere volumes from the Iraqi National Library as well as those at Bayt al-Hikma,the Central Library of the University of Mosul, and others. According toFernando Báez, director of Venezuela’s National Library and author of AUniversal History of the Destruction of Books, almost one million books and tenmillion priceless documents have been destroyed, lost, or stolen throughout Iraqsince 2003. Báez described the losses as “the biggest cultural disaster sincethe descendants of Genghis Khan destroyed Baghdad in 1258.”LOST IN TRANSLATION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s59]All this destruction of human origins and history has led to gaping holes inhumankind’s true history, leading in turn to confusion due to mistranslations,misinterpretations, and name changes within religious documents, which may beascribed simply to the differences among languages and cultures or to deliberateobfuscation.Rabbi Dovid Bendory, rabbinic director for Jews for the Preservation of FirearmsOwnership (JPFO), is just one of the more recent researchers who have foundmajor misunderstandings based on mistranslations of the Bible. In a 2012commentary, Rabbi Bendory explained that one of the most commonly recognizedlines of the Ten Commandments, “Thou shall not kill,” is a mistranslation of theHebrew Lo tirtzach, which actually means “Do not murder.” He said this term has“a clear and unequivocal meaning,” one that “forever changed the course of allhuman history,” as both Jews and Christians have been plagued with guilt andremorse over killing in wars, by accident, or self-defense.“There is a world of difference between killing and murder,” he explained. “Canwe possibly estimate the numbers of lives that have been lost by foolishpacifism rather than righteous defense in the face of evil?”Mauro Biglino also has challenged interpretations and translations of the Bible.Biglino, formerly an Italian translator for the religious publishing house SanPaolo Editors, has been a scholar of religious history and a student of ancientHebrew for more than thirty years. Biglino was fired from his position as atranslator of Vatican material after publishing a book in 2012 in which heclaimed that extraterrestrials guided the development of humankind. He said thiswas confirmed by a careful and literal translation of the original Hebrew Bible.In his original work, The Book That Will Forever Change Our Ideas About theBible, now released as There Is No God in the Bible, Biglino pointed to the OldTestament book of Deuteronomy (1:28) in which scouts reported to Moses ofencountering giants and great cities in the sky inhabited by the “sons of theAnakims.” Current Bible dictionaries fail to explain the Anakims. Yet severalresearchers connect the Anakim to the Nephilim, the oversize hybrid offspring ofthe sons of gods and the daughters of men mentioned in Genesis 6:4. Large bonesand tools found all over the world, though little publicized, attest to theexistence once of a race of giants. The biblical story of David and Goliathcomes to mind.According to Biglino, like the Nephilim, angels in the Bible are described onlyby their function as messengers rather than their physical nature. He said thisis because the ancient scribes were writing about physical beings whose naturewas obvious to the people of that time who had encountered them. They ate,drank, slept, and even washed themselves, hardly the activities of nonphysicalbeings. Only in later centuries, when such face-to-face contact was lost, werethese messengers transformed into metaphysical entities.Biglino noted that the Israelites of the Old Testament obviously did not seetheir god as a transcendent and unique entity, and their relationship with himwas not viewed as unavoidable. “The whole history of Israel is full ofbetrayals, abandonment, cults dedicated to other deities, also called Elohìms,all concrete, all present like the Elohìm leading Israel and with whom there hadbeen this alliance: Jews would serve him and he would help them conquer the landand become a nation. This same Elohìm repeatedly calls himself jealous, and wewonder: how can one be jealous of a partner if there are no rivals in therelationship?” Biglino also compared the original Ten Commandments of Yahweh aswritten in Hebrew to the modern, sanitized, and Christianized version and foundlittle in common.In addition to the account of Ezekiel and his fiery flying saucer, well coveredin other sources and found to accurately describe a subspace vehicle by a NASAscientist, Biglino described the experiences of other biblical figures. Theseinclude Elisha and the prophet Elijah, whose name, Eliyahu, means “My God isEl.” In II Kings 2:10–11, it is clear that Elijah has foreknowledge that hewould be taken, and shortly he was pulled up into the heavens in a whirlwind bya “chariot of fire.” For three days, his countrymen looked for him but failed tofind any sign of him. Biglino has pointed out that: “This was an announcedevent, known in advance by the involved parties and therefore programmed by theElohìms who had decided to take with them this representative of theirs. Onedoes not search for three days, laboring over hills and dales, for someone whohas been kidnapped just in a vision or a dream!” Enoch, the father ofMethuselah, who reportedly lived 365 years, was also taken up to heaven by hisgod.Could these accounts actually be of alien abductions? Biglino has said that theprophet Zechariah encountered an efahm, interpreted as a flying roll orcylinder, similar to some UFOs reported today. He compares such biblicalexperiences with the flying machines of the Sumerian Anunnaki.The Bible’s Psalm 82 describes God in assembly with other gods. Biglino viewedthis as a description of a meeting between the ancient gods, or Elohims, andtheir superiors. Here they are warned about bringing arrogance to theirpositions over humans, as well as reminded that they, too, have finite, althoughlengthy, life spans. Biglino has pointed out that the connection is clear andsimple: “The Elohims die like all ADAMS! It comes as no surprise to anyone whospeculates that ANUNNAKI/ELOHIMS could have a long life—incredibly long forearthly beings, as it was measured on Nibiru’s orbital cycles—but that, aspeople made of flesh and blood, they too were meant to die. Simply astonishingis the fact that the Bible itself says so![emphases in the original].” MauroBiglino’s conclusion was that we have worshipped the extraterrestrials who havecome to our planet as gods, and the original recognition of these multiple godshas, over the years, been reduced to one god. This interpretation does notnecessarily deny the existence of an omniscient universal creator God.Biglino is not alone in believing that extraterrestrials are mentioned in theBible. In 2003, Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a Vatican spokesman on the UFOissue, stated that not believing in “UFOs and the presence of other livingbeings is a sin. Their existence is not only proven by about a millionwitnesses, including those of many atheist scientists, but it is also confirmedby some passages of the Scripture that clarify some points about theirpresence.”This vision by the Catholic Church was supported by José Gabriel Funes, anArgentinean Jesuit and director of the Vatican Observatory. In a 2008 interview,Father Funes stated, “It is possible to believe in God and in extraterrestrials.The existence of other worlds and other life, even more evolved than ours, canbe accepted without this interfering in the discussion of the faith of creation,the incarnation, the redemption. … As a multiplicity of creatures exist onearth, so there could be other beings, also intelligent, created by God. Thisdoes not contrast with our faith because we cannot put limits on the creativefreedom of God.”The claims of José Funes and Mauro Biglino may seem outrageous to some. Yettheir interpretation of the Bible is similar to the recent translations ofSumerian glyphs and ancient Hebrew. According to one reviewer of Biglino’s work,“Many translators have come up with parallel results. Mr. Biglino bringsvalidity to the former researchers by sharing it with us. These are thetranslations that come through when you use the correct database to transcribefrom. Researchers that worked with Michael Heiser [that critic of ZechariaSitchin] are government funded and they use a newer base to translate with,which is preposterous to do so, due to the changing meanings and subsets ofcivilizations over time. The originals were hundreds if not thousands of yearsolder than the database that Heiser’s group was translating with. Further,academics wouldn’t be allowed to put their stamp of approval on any work theyfound that’s related to extraterrestrials, due to the socio-economic upheaval itcould cause. That very thing must be avoided at all costs, as far as they areconcerned. Our government and the people behind the scenes are not receptive toanything other than what they’ve mandated. History is written by the victors,and rarely does the truth match what the victors write about. If the governmentallowed the truth, then billions of history, medical, financial, etc. bookswould need to be corrected.”It is little wonder that learned men down through the ages have misunderstoodthe truths lying behind the gods of legend and myth? “Is it any wonder that‘science’ can’t find any evidence for ancient aliens, or lost knowledge?” askedauthor Philip Coppens, a prolific writer who has made a study of old legends andsecret societies throughout his life. If historians have been misled concerningtrue history, then perhaps it is time we consider that much of modern man’sentire worldview has been misguided."},{"pageContent":"PART III [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt03]THE MIDDLE AGES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt03]The only thing new in the world is the history you don’t know.—HARRY S. TRUMAN THE DARK AGES WAS A TIME OF GREAT INSTABILITY AND IGNORANCE in the Westernworld. It dragged on from approximately AD 500 until the Renaissance. Thoseliving with the luxuries of the twenty-first century have largely forgotten thatprior to the year 1900 the vast majority of people in the world were illiterate,had no indoor plumbing, and lived at the whim of their rulers.Only remnants of Greece and Rome’s knowledge had been preserved by a fewChristian monks in Ireland, Italy, France, and Britain. If not for these monks,along with libraries in the Muslim countries, no knowledge whatsoever would havebeen preserved for us today.The Roman Church controlled every aspect of life. To speak against the Churchopened one to censorship, excommunication, or even death. The suffocation offree thinking led to the growth of secret societies and sects, many of whichbegan in biblical times and vied with one another for control over ancientsecrets. Much like the later Invisible College of Elizabethan times, thesesocieties collectively were considered mystery schools, reservoirs of esotericknowledge that was largely incomprehensible and thus fear-inspiring to thegeneral public. Their literature was carefully constructed to both conceal andreveal some of their knowledge.One such repository of ancient knowledge was the Sumerian “Table of Destiny,”thought to be the same as the Tables of Testimony mentioned in Exodus 31:18, asother Bible verses—Exodus 24:12 and 25:16—make it clear that these tables arenot the Ten Commandments. British author Laurence Gardner believed this ancientarchive may be the legendary Emerald Tablet of Thoth-Hermes. This tablet,considered one of the most ancient and secret of writings, is claimed to be thework of Hermes Trismegistus (Hermes the Thrice-Greatest), a composite characterof the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, called Ninurta in ancientSumer. Thoth/Ninurta was said to be a survivor of Atlantis who passed alongantediluvian knowledge to a son of Noah—Ham.“He was the essential founder of the esoteric and arcane ‘underground stream’which flowed through the ages,” stated Gardner, “and his Greek name, Hermes, wasdirectly related to the science of pyramid construction, deriving from the wordherma, which relates to a ‘pile of stones.’ Indeed, the Great Pyramid issometimes called ‘the Sanctuary of Thoth.’ ”This tablet of knowledge was passed from ancient Sumer to Egypt and on to Greekand Roman masters such as Homer, Virgil, Pythagoras, Plato, and Ovid. In theMiddle Ages and onward, it was passed through such secret societies as theRosicrucians and Knights Templar and on to the Freemasons.But such ancient knowledge had to be kept secret in the ages following thecollapse of the Roman Empire. Christianity had gained absolute supremacy in theWestern world, and until the Great Schism and the fall of Constantinople to theMuslim Ottoman Empire in 1453, the Roman Church stood as the ultimate authorityin the Western world. Through the lending of both its money and blessings, theVatican dominated kings and queens and controlled the lives of ordinary citizensthrough fear of excommunication and its infamous Inquisition.Only the clergy and aristocracy could read and write, and the smaller factionsof Christianity were so fractious that they held little power. With thecrusaders holding the Holy Land of the Middle East, the unchallenged power ofthe Church became further centralized and all-powerful. The fact that most kingsand queens had borrowed money from the Vatican only added to their subservience.Only in Scotland, where King Robert the Bruce was excommunicated in 1306 andonly when Martin Luther’s Ninety-five Theses were made public in 1517 and HenryVIII established the breakaway Church of England in 1534 was the power ofCatholicism challenged.KNIGHTS TEMPLAR [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s60]Earlier, a gnostic group called Cathars, mostly located in southern France, hadproved to be a problem for the Church, as they claimed to possess knowledgeconcerning Mary Magdalene and her descendants that ran counter to Rome’steachings. Known as the “pure ones” due to the conviction that their beliefswere purer than those of the Roman Church, the Cathars claimed that theirknowledge had been passed along by refugees from Palestine who had fled theRoman invasion of AD 70. Beginning in 1209, French king Philip II, at the ordersof Pope Innocent III, launched the Albigensian Crusade in an attempt to wipe outthe Cathars, considered the most serious challenge to the Catholic Church tothat date. Until very recently, little was known of the Cathars because theRoman Church had destroyed any material favorable to them.To avoid annihilation, many Cathars simply blended into the populace. In lateryears, French leaders from Cathar families considered a religious crusade totake the Holy Land, and particularly Jerusalem, as a convenient excuse to searchfor verification of the Cathar traditions. Peter the Hermit—generally consideredto be instrumental in promoting the First Crusade, along with Saint Bernard—wasa personal tutor to the Crusade’s leader, Godfrey de Bouillon, himself a memberof a Cathar family and believed by some to be the founder of Freemasonry.The First Crusade led to the creation of societies that used secrecy asprotection from the Roman Church, which began protecting its theology byincreasingly violent means. By many recent accounts, at least one group ofCrusaders brought back more than just heresy—they also came back with hardevidence of error and duplicity in Church dogma. In 1307, the Church tried toexterminate this group, proclaimed as heretics and blasphemers. They were theKnights Templar, whose traditions live on today within Freemasonry.This religious-military knighthood, originally called The Order of the PoorKnights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, was formed in 1118 when nineFrench Crusaders appeared before King Baldwin of Jerusalem and asked to beallowed to protect pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. They also askedpermission to stay in the ruins of Solomon’s Temple, which had later been thepalace of King Herod. These knights were led by Hugh de Payens, a nobleman inthe service of his cousin, Hughes, Count of Champagne, and André de Montbard,the uncle of Bernard of Clairvaux, later known as the Cistercian Saint Bernard.All were from families connected to the Cathars. Authors Lynn Picknett and ClivePrince, experts on the Knights Templar, wrote, “Payens and his nine companionsall came from either Champagne or the Languedoc, and included the Count ofProvence, and it is quite apparent that they went to the Holy Land with aspecific mission in mind.” Provence lies adjacent to the Languedoc region ofsouthern France and includes Marseilles, where by tradition Mary Magdalenearrived with other Palestinian refugees following the crucifixion of JesusChrist. It was in Provence that the knights hid the treasure of both wealth andknowledge they uncovered in Jerusalem.Once in Jerusalem, King Baldwin, a brother of de Bouillon, granted the knights’request, and the order was formed, becoming known as the Knights of the Temple,soon shortened to Knights Templar. For nine years, the Knights Templar excavatedunder the palace of King Herod, which had been built on top of the ruins of thetemple built by King Solomon nearly a thousand years before Christ. Someresearchers state that Solomon’s Temple was merely a carbon copy of a Sumeriantemple dedicated to the god Ninurta and constructed almost a thousand yearsearlier.Much of Solomon’s treasure—which included not only much gold, silver, andprecious gems but also texts, scrolls, and tablets bearing the ancient knowledgeof the gods—had been buried there by Jews to protect it from looting Romansduring the Jewish Revolt of AD 66. According to the Histories, a history of Romewritten by Tacitus in AD 109, Pompey the Great was shocked when he enteredSolomon’s Temple in 63 BC only to find “the sanctuary was empty and the Holy ofHolies untenanted.”However, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70, the Romans managed to cart off aportion of the treasure left behind to prevent further searching. They took itto Rome as war booty. The remainder, probably the most sacred tablets andscrolls, was secured in the catacombs under the temple and later forgotten byauthorities when Herod’s palace was built.Knowledge of this undiscovered treasure passed into southern France in AD 410,when a former Roman commander, Alaric, led his Gothic army in sacking Rome. Thesecrets of Solomon’s Treasure were taken to the homeland of the Goths, theLanguedoc region in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France.It was from here that the French Cathars learned of the treasure still buried inJerusalem. This information was passed through Cathari families and led to thefomenting of the First Crusade.With the return of the Knights Templar, Solomon’s Treasure was once againreunited with the portion taken from Rome by Alaric. It remained hidden, withonly bits of the ancient knowledge being used by secret societies, such as theRosicrucians, Freemasons, the Bavarian Illuminati, and the elusive Priory ofSion, until the entire treasure hoard was taken by the German Nazis in early1944.In addition to secrets involving architecture, medicine, and instruments such asmagnetic compasses, the knights learned the management of money. Althoughconventional history traces the development of modern banking to early Jewishand Italian lending institutions, the Knights Templar predated the Rothschildsand the Medicis.“They pioneered the concept of credit facilities, as well as the allocation ofcredit for commercial development and expansion. They performed, in fact,virtually all the functions of a 20th century merchant bank,” wrote Baigent andLeigh. “At the peak of their power, the Templars handled much, if not most, ofthe available capital in Western Europe.”The Templars held long-term private trust funds, accessible only by theoriginators of the account, a practice that continues today in Swiss banks. Itcan also be argued that the Templars first introduced the credit card andpackaged tours, as they developed fund transfers by note, a technique mostprobably obtained from their Muslim contacts in the Middle East.ALCHEMY: SCIENCE, MAGIC, OR BOTH? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s61]Pieces of the ancient knowledge handed down from the gods concerning chemistrywere used during the Middle Ages as a basis for the science of that day, knownas alchemy. During medieval times, one of the primary goals of alchemists was toturn base metals into valuable gold or silver.There is some controversy over whether the word alchemy stems from ancientEgypt, earlier known as Khem or Chem, or if the name derived from the MedievalLatin alkimia, Islamic kimya, or perhaps from the Greek khemeioa.According to English author E. J. Holmyard, adherents of alchemy have includedthe royal bloodlines of Europe as well as common folk. Among alchemists, heincluded everyone from “kings, popes, and emperors to minor clergy, parishclerks, smiths, dyers, and tinkers. Even such accomplished men as Roger Bacon,St. Thomas Aquinas, Sir Thomas Browne, John Evelyn, and Sir Isaac Newton weredeeply interested in it, and Charles II had an alchemical laboratory built underthe royal bedchamber with access by a private staircase. Other alchemicalmonarchs were Herakleios I of Byzantium, James IV of Scotland, and the EmperorRudolf II.”Alchemy was the science of the times, and while it involved rudimentarychemistry, biology, geometry, numerology, and even physics, some practitionersgravitated toward the power of gold found in money.The magic of money manipulation may have been perfected in more modern times,but its roots go far back into history, and there appears to be a correlationbetween control by money, gold, and the ancient gods. In his 2010 book,Babylon’s Banksters, Joseph P. Farrell, as a doctoral graduate of PembrokeCollege, Oxford, who had unparalleled access to old books and manuscripts inOxford University’s library, said his thesis was both simple to state butdifficult to understand. “Since ancient times and with more or lessuninterrupted constancy, there has existed an international money power whichseeks by a variety of means—including fraud, deception, assassination, andwar—to usurp the money- and credit-creating power of the various states it hassought to dominate, and to obfuscate and occult the profound connection betweenthat money-creating power and the deep ‘alchemical physics’ that such powerimplies.”In ancient times, the coinage of money was conducted and controlled by thepriesthoods in obedience to their gods. In Babylon, descendant of the Sumerianculture, checks were in use as draws on deposits of valuables. But the godsdemanded gold or silver, as noted in the Laws of Hammurabi. The monetary systemsof Babylonia established branches on the coast of Greece and in the Mycenaeancenters. The discovery of Babylonian seals in the Greek islands of the Cycladesshowed that clay “promises to pay” in silver were written for loans against realgoods. According to Farrell, such practices gave rise to an “international classof bullion brokers” or bankers. “Succinctly stated, the bullion trust and thetemple are at the minimum allies, and at the maximum, the one has infiltratedand taken over the other.”The ancient rulers, whether aliens themselves or mere representatives,discovered that their religions required financial support. Going back to atleast the Babylonian civilization, the temples were dependent on financialinstitutions.The Hebrew Mogen David, or Star of David, is of Babylonian origin and isindicative of how the Babylonian/Sumerian culture was blended with Hebrewreligion during the Jews’ captivity in Babylon. And it was in the Temple atJerusalem that Jesus turned violent against the money changers. Matthew 21:12–13relates, “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that soldand bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and theseats of those who sold doves, and said unto them, ‘it is written, My houseshall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.’Gold remained at the top of the financial pyramid. As commonly known, gold was abasic of the ancient Egyptian culture, being used for ornaments, statues, andcoins. Gold, the objective of the Anunnaki, was still considered sacred anddivine in ancient Egypt and was of special importance to the royal family, whothemselves were considered gods. King Tutankhamen was buried with a now-famoussolid gold mask. Coins came in the form of rings of gold, silver, and copper,each with a specific weight certified by the priesthood. Coins were primarilyused to pay foreign mercenaries, who would take them to their home country to beexchanged for goods and services.The connection between church and state money management continued through theRoman Empire. The Roman Constitution decreed that the mining and coinage of goldwas under the authority of the Roman pontiff. “Julius Caesar erected the coinageof gold into a sacerdotal prerogative; this prerogative was attached to thesovereign and his successors, not as the emperors, but as the high priests ofRome,” noted Alexander del Mar, the American economist and historian who becamethe first director of the U.S. Treasury’s Bureau of Statistics in 1866. “Itwould have been sacrilege, punishable by torture, death, and anathema for anyother prince than the sovereign-pontiff to strike coins of gold; it would havebeen sacrilege to give currency to any others; hence no other Christian prince,not even the pope of Rome, nor the sovereign of the Western or Medieval empire,attempted to coin gold while the ancient [Roman] Empire survived.” It was onlyfollowing the fall of Constantinople in 1204 that the legal authority to coinand regulate money became the prerogative of kings and national rulers.Due to the reach of their empire, the Romans were able to mine more gold thanthe Egyptians. One example can be seen in their records, which noted that Spainshipped 1,400 tons of gold to Rome each year.In 1717, the United Kingdom adopted the gold standard, renouncing it in 1931 dueto market manipulation, which caused declining prices. The United States, whichhad prospered since abolishing a central bank in 1836, soon adopted the goldstandard. Gold certificates circulated in the United States and could beconverted to gold coins by visiting any bank. But in 1933, as the GreatDepression deepened and bank runs became more and more common, an executiveorder by President Franklin Roosevelt mandated the confiscation of gold in aneffort to inflate the dollar. The gold standard was formally abandoned underPresident Nixon in 1971, but private ownership of gold was again made legal in1974.In medieval Europe, only the most royal personages held gold. The commoncurrency was copper coins. Thought to have healing powers, possibly due tosecret knowledge passed down from the ancient civilizations, gold was consumedby the nobility in the form of leaf, flakes, or dust. This also was an overtdisplay of wealth for some. Kings and queens wore crowns of gold, symbolizingthe light of the sun, which bestowed divine authority.The old alchemists apparently suspected the hidden magic of gold but had lostthe specifics. It has been assumed that they wanted gold to become wealthy, buta close study of alchemy and occultism reveals that these men and women of thepast were attempting to recover ancient knowledge long since lost in the mistsof time. One such secret will be revealed later.BACON’S INVISIBLE COLLEGE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s62]Vestiges of the ancient science of energy manipulation were passed along throughthe Middle Ages via secret-society initiations, symbols, and coded language. InThe Shadow of Solomon, Laurence Gardner traced this “underground stream ofknowledge” from medieval alchemists through Sir Francis Bacon’s InvisibleCollege to more modern Masonic lodges, many of which were infiltrated by themysterious Bavarian Illuminati. The brilliant Bacon, by several accounts theillegitimate son of England’s Queen Elizabeth I, oversaw the editing of the KingJames Bible and is believed by many prominent persons to be the true author ofWilliam Shakespeare’s plays and sonnetsJournalist A. E. Loosley wrote that “Francis Bacon was mainly, if not entirely,responsible for a threefold undertaking, (1st) the Shakespearian Plays; (2nd)the creation in its present form of Freemasonry, and (3rd) the translation ofthe Holy Bible into its present well-known Authorized Version. The three wereundoubtedly intermingled.” He also attributed an amazing coincidence of names inPsalms to a code of Bacon, known to have been a Rosicrucian grand master anddescribed as a “founder of Freemasonry.”“I have been able, quite recently, to clear up one point of possible doubt andat the same time to establish a claim for its certainty. It was in connectionwith that 46th Psalm, in which, in the Authorized Version, the 46th word fromthe beginning is ‘shake’ and the 46th from the end is ‘spear.’ Such anarrangement—especially in the 46th Psalm—would be a most remarkable coincidenceif it were not intentionally so arranged,” noted Loosley. Tacked onto the end ofPsalm 46 is the word Selah, which is not part of the psalm but a term of unknownmeaning, though thought by scholars to signify a cue for the congregation topause for a prayer or song.“In order to satisfy myself on the question, I sought an opportunity ofcomparing the wording in the Authorized Version with that in one of the earlierversions. I have now been able to satisfy myself that it was not a coincidenceat all, but was plainly the result of deliberate planning. I give below, side byside, the wording of the first three and last three verses in the ‘Breeches’Bible and that in the Authorized Version. In the former the 47 words up to theword ‘Shake’ and the 44 words from ‘Spear’ to the end of the Psalm were alteredto 46 in each case in the Authorized Version.”Loosley noted that forty-seven divines (clergymen) were entrusted by King Jameswith the work of translating the Bible. If Francis Bacon was discounted as onlythe editor, that would leave forty-six, the number of the psalm in question. “Ifthis be true, and I feel one is justified in believing it, a very interestinglight is thrown on the keen working of Bacon’s mind. The trick would be one inwhich he would take a keen delight.”Bacon’s circle of friends included many Britons who undoubtedly had access tothe elder secrets carried through the Knights Templar on into Freemasonry. Theseincluded Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, Edward de Vere, JohnFletcher, and Philip Sidney, all of whom were connected to the nationalintelligence service created by Queen Elizabeth. There is good reason to believethat many, if not all, of these worthy men contributed to the writings ofShakespeare. They also were early Freemasons, members of that secret societycreated from stonemason guilds by the Knights Templar following theirdissolution in 1307.These Freemason secrets, through many generations of initiations, areintricately tied to King Solomon and the building of his great temple. What manydon’t know is that the name Solomon—as well as the name of King David beforehim—was initially just a title. His real name was Jedidiah. According toGardner, the name of Solomon’s father “is uncertain, since the titular style ofDavid has predominated (although never recorded as a personal name before thattime). Mesopotamian texts from the palace of Mari refer, however, to theDavidum, equivalent to caesar or emperor, and the title has stuck as a name tothe present day. In reality, Solomon and his successors were all Davids(Davidums).”Freemasonry’s basic knowledge began with the secrets of King Solomon handed downfrom the ancient gods. These included money management, construction of archesusing keystones, lifesaving techniques, and even how to make a magnetic compass.Such hidden knowledge of the ancients then moved through the mystery schools ofEgypt and via the Hebrew exodus into Palestine. From there, it was passed intoEurope by the Knights Templar, who created Freemasonry from their stonemasonguilds following the attacks by the Church in 1307.The biblical Ark of the Covenant appears on the coat of arms of the United GrandLodge of England, and a replica is featured in the Royal Arch Room in the GeorgeWashington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria, Virginia. Clearly, the arkonce was of the utmost significance to adherents of underground knowledge. Thissignificance will be discussed later.However, the secretive masons lost much of the ancient knowledge when theEnglish Whig Revolution of 1688 exiled the Stuart dynasty. Many of the Stuartsupporters, known as Jacobites, fled England, taking with them the originalMasonic secrets. “When the new-style Georgian Freemasonry emerged from 1717[when the Grand Lodge of England was founded], the best it could do was toendeavor to pick up some threads—but they were few,” explained Gardner. Withthis break in the evolution of Freemasonry, much of the ancient knowledge wasforgotten.Apparently, the biggest secret of Freemasonry today is that it has lost most, ifnot all, of its secrets, especially those from antiquity. Gardner declared, “Theskills of the Master Craftsman on which the philosophy was founded were switchedin emphasis from the practical [operative masonry] to the personal [speculativemasonry], and became so veiled by confusing allegory that the original purposewas lost and forgotten. This is not to say that the benevolent ideals of today’sfraternity are anything less than commendable, but they are not what Freemasonrywas concerned with before the 18th century.”THE MAGIC OF GOLD [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s63]Bacon’s Invisible College members and their alchemist contemporaries, practicinga blend of philosophy, mysticism, astrology, and chemical technology, sought thepower to create gold. However, contrary to what moderns believe, this gold wasnot necessarily in the form of nuggets, coins, or bars. One prominentseventeenth-century alchemist was Thomas Vaughan, who called himself EirenaeusPhilalethes. Vaughan wrote that the fabled philosopher’s stone was actually“nothing but gold digested to the highest degree of purity and subtle fixation …a very fine powder.”Support for the idea that alchemists were attempting to duplicate the processesthat transformed gold into a white powder came from Alchemy, The AncientScience, by Neil Powell, who wrote, “Alchemists used a bewildering variety ofingredients in their search for the Philosopher’s Stone. Copper and lead, sulfurand arsenic, urine and bile were but a few of them. Substances were combined andseparated, heated and cooled, vaporized and solidified, and sometimes even justleft to rot. The processes carried out in the laboratory were often fairlycomplex. Calcination, sublimation, and distillation are three of the betterknown ones. In calcination, metals and minerals were reduced to a fine powder.In sublimation, a substance was heated until it vaporized, and then returned toits solid state by rapidly cooling the vapor. In distillation, a liquid wasconverted into a vapor by boiling, and then condensed back into a liquid bycooling. These and many of the other processes required heat, so furnaces werethe most important equipment in the alchemist’s laboratory.”The connection between the gold powder of the alchemists and ancient legends hascaught the attention of a growing number of scholars and researchers, who haveconcluded that the search for gold powder was inspired by ancient accounts ofour ancestors ingesting what seemed to be strange, life-granting substances.Laurence Gardner noted that the oldest complete book in the world—the EgyptianBook of the Dead—tells of the pharaohs ingesting “the bread of presence,” alsocalled “schefa food,” while making the ritualistic journey to the afterlife. Ateach stage, the pharaoh would ask, “What is it?”This has been compared to the Biblical account of Moses and the Israelites inthe desert following the exodus from Egypt. To sustain themselves in thewilderness, Moses and his people ate a white, powdery substance they calledmanna. This manna was baked into small cakes or boiled. In Hebrew, mannaliterally means “What is it?” The duplication of the Egyptian cry of “What isit?” is not lost on researchers.“They knew there were superconductors inherent in the human body,” Gardnerwrote. “They knew that both the physical body and the light body [the spirit orsoul] had to be fed to increase hormonal production and the ultimate food forthe latter was called shem-an-na by the Babylonians, mfkzt by the Egyptians andmanna by the Israelites.”It is significant that despite today’s costly and extensive research in the areaof superconductors, such secrets were known many thousands of years ago byancient mystics and priests. Gardner wrote, “It is clear, however, from thedocumentary evidence of ancient times, that the attributes of superconductorsand gravity defiance were known, even if not understood, in a distant world ofpriestly levitation, godly communication, and the phenomenal power of the‘electrikus.’ In Greek mythology the quest for the secret of this substance wasat the heart of the Golden Fleece legend, while in biblical terms it was themystical realm of the Ark of the Covenant—the golden coffer, which Moses broughtout of Sinai, and was later housed in the Temple of Jerusalem.”Gardner explained how this knowledge was lost through time. “In ancient Sumer,PGMs [platinum group metals] called adamas were classified as an-na (firestone).Because of the bright silvery color described in old records, the mysteriouslydesignated shining metal was long presumed to have been tin by misguidedmetallurgical adepts of the Middle Ages, while others who knew something ofcupellation and parting, strove earnestly with salts, sulfurs, and mysticalsolutions, endeavoring to extrapolate gold from lead. This leaves us no doubtthat, although PGMs were a part of ancient technology, they were (just likeelectricity) lost to us for many centuries until archeological and geologicalresearch caught up with them again.”The story of Exodus may provide evidence of this powdered gold in use. It tellshow Moses became angered upon his return from the mountain where he was giventablets by his god. It seems in his absence the Israelites had taken most of thegold in their possession and melted it down to make a calf, which they thenworshipped. Exodus 32:20 (New International Version) states, “And he [Moses]took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it topowder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.” Sinceswallowing molten metal would be lethal, obviously Moses, who had been welleducated in esoteric knowledge passed from Sumer to Egypt, knew the secret ofmaking what has come to be known as high-spin monatomic gold powder.This idea is supported by the accounts of British archaeologist William FlindersPetrie, who in 1904 discovered a large smelting facility on Mount Horeb, locatedin the southern end of the Sinai Peninsula. Some scholars believe that Horeb isthe actual location of the Mountain of Moses mentioned in the Bible.It was on Horeb that Petrie discovered an enclosed temple composed of adjoininghalls, shrines, and chambers, all filled with carvings, pillars, and stelaedepicting Egyptian nobility and mentioning the mysterious mfkzt. Most surprisingwas the discovery of a metallurgist’s crucible along with a considerable amountof pure white powder cleverly concealed under the flagstone. Unconcerned withthe powder, Petrie allowed it to blow away in the Sinai winds.Engravings in this ancient temple depict various Egyptian rulers, among theseTuthmosis IV and Amenhotep III along with the god Hathor. In these carvingsvarious persons are offering the king a conical loaf, suspected to be thelegendary white powder known as mfkzt. This suspicion is strongly supported bythe fact that the figure offering the powder can be identified as an Egyptiantreasurer named Sobekhotep, elsewhere described as the man who “brought thenoble Precious Stone to his majesty.”The ancient gold powder today can be connected to the accidental discovery ofsingle-atom (monatomic) elements in the 1970s by Phoenix-area cotton farmerDavid Hudson. His discovery was followed by several scientific papers exploringthe mysteries of atomic structure, nucleus deformation, and electromagnetism.Hudson, trained in the sciences, spent millions on research before obtainingeleven worldwide patents on his “orbitally rearranged monatomic elements(ORME).” He found that the nuclei of such monatomic matter act in an unusualmanner. Under certain circumstances, they begin spinning, becoming deformed,flatten, and enter a “highward” or high-spin state. When reaching this state,the electrons turn to pure white light, and the individual atoms separate,producing a white monatomic powder.Using thermogravimetric analysis, it was found that a sample of Hudson’smonatomic matter lost 44 percent of its original weight when reduced to thiswhite powder state. By either heating or cooling the material, it would gainweight or lose weight and when heated, could achieve a gravitational attractionof less than zero. Some scientists have concluded that this newly discoveredmaterial is “exotic matter” capable of creating energy fields that bend time andspace. The material’s antigravitational properties were confirmed when it wasshown that a weighing pan weighed less when the powder was placed in it than itdid empty. The matter had passed its antigravitational properties to the pan.In addition to this amazing conclusion, it was found that when the white powderwas heated to a certain degree, not only did its weight disappear, but thepowder itself vanished from sight. When a spatula was used to stir around in thepan, there apparently was nothing there. Yet as the material cooled, itreappeared in its original configuration. The material had not simplydisappeared, it apparently had moved into another dimensional plane.The fabled Ark of the Covenant may have played a role in the story of themysterious monatomic gold, as some researchers believe it was a vessel filledwith the white powder, causing it to levitate and act as a speaker for the voiceof a god. According to Gardner, “The Ark of the Covenant was a powerfulelectronic arcing device—the provider of the ‘fire’ with which Moses burned theGolden Calf. As a storage facility for the [ORME] powder, it also became asuperconductor in its own right, with the ability to ride on its own MeissnerField.” German physicist Walter Meissner demonstrated the effect of manipulatingmagnetic energy fields by a superconductor in 1933.Was the ark a supernatural manifestation or an alien artifact? Gardner suggestedthat the ark was filled with the white powder of gold, which allowed it to bemoved by levitation. After all, descriptions of the ark’s solid gold mercy seatwould mean it weighed more than 2,700 pounds, an impossible weight for only afew men to carry.Alan Alford argued that Abraham’s god, Yahweh, was an Anunnaki who kept incommunication with his chosen people through the Ark of the Covenant, in realitya radio transmitter/receiver. Rene A. Boulay, author of Flying Serpents andDragons: The Story of Mankind’s Reptilian Past, also saw the ark as acommunication device and thought it significant that the ark had to be completedaccording to very precise instructions before the tablets containing the TenCommandments were placed inside. “The tablets presumably contained the powersource necessary to activate the receiver-transmitter,” he wrote.A verse in the Old Testament (Numbers 7:89) may even have described the locationof the device’s speaker: “When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak withthe Lord, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim abovethe atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony. And he spoke with him” (NewInternational Version).Science is coming to understand that gravity and time are interconnected aspectsof hyperspace energy and that this new monatomic technology allows manipulationand control at the subatomic level. Some scientists believe that such controlmight do much more than offer new propulsion technology. It may open the door toantigravity, limitless free energy, faster-than-light speeds, and much more,perhaps even interdimensional travel and time travel.DISCOVERIES IN IRAQ [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s64]In addition to the amazing properties listed earlier, some believe that thewhite powder of gold might also provide a cure for diseases such as AIDS andcancer, even put an end to the aging process. This amazing substance may haveeven been a source of interest for certain U.S. leaders with secret-societyconnections who wanted to send troops into Iraq in 2003. Could this white powderhave been a reason?In 1999, ABC News reported that nearly four hundred ancient Sumerian artifactshad been discovered in the southern Iraqi town of Basmyiah, about one hundredmiles south of Baghdad. The Iraqi News Agency said the objects ranged fromanimal and human-shaped “toys” to cuneiform tablets and even “ancient weapons.”At least one cylinder seal depicted a tall person thought to represent KingGilgamesh. The antiquities were dated to before 2500 BC and were stored in thebasement of the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad.Further discoveries in Iraq were made in 2002 and early 2003 by archaeologistsfrom the Bavarian Department of Historical Monuments in Munich, Germany, usingdigital mapping technology. According to spokesman Jorg Fassbinder, amagnetometer was utilized to locate buried walls, gardens, palaces, and asurprising network of canals that would have made Uruk a “Venice in the desert.”This equipment also located a structure in the middle of the Euphrates River,which Fassbinder’s team believed to be the tomb of Gilgamesh. The newdiscoveries were added to those stored in Baghdad’s Iraqi National Museum, whichhad been closed to the public since the first Gulf War in 1991.By mid-2002, President George W. Bush was clearly intent on invading Iraq,citing weapons of mass destruction hidden there. His well-publicized claim ofsuch weapons came despite assurances from United Nations chief weapons inspectorHans Blix, officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and even ScottRitter, a former U.S. weapons inspector, that Iraq had no nuclear or biologicalweapons of mass destruction. On March 20, 2003, U.S. forces crossed Iraq’sborders. Unlike previous military campaigns, in which armies captured key citiesbefore consolidating their forces and moving to the next objective, U.S. forcesmade a beeline for Baghdad, bypassing most of the country.Once the capital was in American hands, by late April 2003, looters took atleast fifty thousand priceless artifacts and tablets from the Iraqi NationalMuseum. Despite prior attempts to alert American military officers of the dangerof losing seven-thousand-year-old artifacts, American authorities failed toprevent the wholesale looting of humankind’s most ancient treasures. “It was myimpression that the Department of Defense had made provisions for thesafeguarding of monuments and museums,” lamented Maxwell Anderson, president ofthe Association of Art Museum Directors. Anderson was among a group that inJanuary 2003 had alerted Pentagon and State Department officials to theimportance of these antiquities.When the looting began, one Iraqi archaeologist summoned U.S. troops to protectthe National Museum. Five Marines accompanied the man to the museum and chasedout the thieves by firing shots over their heads. However, after about thirtyminutes, the soldiers were ordered to withdraw, and the looters soon returned.The only building in Baghdad to receive full American protection was theMinistry of Oil.Western media portrayed the looting as a chaotic scramble created by commonthieves. Yet evidence has emerged that some of these looters were highlyorganized and had an agenda. According to an Associated Press report, somethieves had keys to the Iraqi National Museum and its vaults. McGuire Gibson ofThe Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago said that “it looks as ifpart of the theft was a very, very deliberate, planned action,” and noted thatthe thieves were able to target the best material in the museum.” I have asuspicion it was organized outside the country. In fact, I’m pretty sure itwas,” he said. Dony George, head of the Baghdad National Museum, agreed. “Ibelieve they were people who knew what they wanted. They had passed by thegypsum copy of the Black Obelisk. This means that they must have beenspecialists. They did not touch the copies.” Christopher Bollyn of the AmericanFree Press also noted that the thieves used glasscutters unavailable in Iraq.Moreover, they were able to take away a huge bronze bust that would haverequired a forklift to move.Such suspicions were later confirmed by Colonel Matthew Bogdanos, deputydirector for the Joint Interagency Coordination Group, originally assigned toseek out weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. After gaining permission fromGeneral Tommy Franks, Bogdanos probed the museum looting.In an interview published in the January–February 2004 issue of Archaeology,Bogdanos was asked what was still missing from the Iraqi National Museum. Hereplied, “You have the public gallery from which originally 40 exhibits weretaken. We’ve recovered 11. Turning to the storage rooms, there were about 3,150pieces taken from those, and that’s almost certainly by random andindiscriminant looters. Of those, we’ve recovered 2,700. So there’s about 400 ofthese pieces, excavated pieces, missing.“The final group is from the basement,” he added. “The basement is what we’vebeen calling the inside job. And I will say it forever like a mantra: it isinconceivable to me that the basement was breached and the items stolen withoutan intimate insider’s knowledge of the museum. From there about 10,000 pieceswere taken. We’ve only recovered 650, approximately.”Who wanted these artifacts gone and why? Could it be possible that theoccupation of Iraq had more to do with gaining control over artifacts andtechnology than with stopping weapons of mass destruction or bringing freedomand democracy to the region? Michael E. Salla, who has taught at the AmericanUniversity in Washington, D.C., the Australian National University in Canberra,and George Washington University, believes this is indeed the case. “Competingclandestine government organizations are struggling through proxy means to takecontrol of ancient extraterrestrial (ET) technology that exists in Iraq,” hewrote in a 2002 research study. Could Saddam Hussein have been working onunlocking the secrets of the monatomic gold? After all, it was widely reportedthat Hussein believed he was the reincarnated Nebuchadnezzar. If the UnitedStates believed that he would succeed, could that have contributed to the rushto war with Iraq?And yet this cutting-edge science of today apparently was known to selectedpersons thousands of years ago, including King Nebuchadnezzar. The biblical Bookof Daniel details an attempt to communicate with ancient Mesopotamian gods byNebuchadnezzar, who built a tall narrow structure of gold near Babylon. Thisstructure has been described as a furnace, suggesting that it was used toproduce the mystical white powder of gold. However, the king’s men were unableto make it work properly. When three Hebrew scholar/priests who had beenappointed by the prophet Daniel to administrate Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, andAbednego—refused to serve the king, they were thrown into the crucible. Butafter clothing themselves in hats, coats, and “other garments,” the triosurvived the fire.Oddly enough, when Nebuchanezzar checked to see if the three were dead, he wasamazed, saying, “Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, andthey have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God” (Daniel3:25, King James Version). Although no further mention is made of this fourth,godlike person, the three Israelites were honored by the king and prosperedunder his kingship. Obviously there is something much more to gold thanornamental jewelry and wealth.Could the millennia-long veneration of gold have more to do with ancientknowledge of its intrinsic power than with its monetary worth? Could SaddamHussein have been working on unlocking the secrets of the white-powder gold? Wasthere somewhere someone more concerned with gaining control over recentlydiscovered knowledge and perhaps even technology that might undo the modernmonopolies in religion and technology than with gaining oil or regime change?This is not sheer science fiction. As noted by Laurence Gardner, “In the fieldof quantum mechanics, scientists have recently confirmed that matter can indeedbe in two places at once. It is now established that, through quantumentanglement, particles millions of light-years apart can be connected withoutphysical contact. Space-time can now be manipulated; teleportation is becoming areality; gravity-resistant material is heralded for air transport, and virtualscience has led to a greater understanding of hyper-dimensional environments.”But most people don’t know any of this. As Stephen Hawking noted in TheIllustrated Brief History of Time, “Only a few people can keep up with therapidly advancing frontier of knowledge, and they have to devote their wholetime to it and specialize in one small area. The rest of the population haslittle idea of the advances that are being made or the excitement they aregenerating.” The same could be said about the advances in understanding truehuman origins and history.KHAZARIA: MASTERING FINANCIAL CONTROL [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s65]The two basic human control mechanisms—religion and banking—were first formed inancient Sumer, legacies of the Anunnaki gods, according to some. The people wholearned well these mechanisms dispersed after calamity struck Sumer andre-formed as the nucleus of the later Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations aswell as lesser nation-states.If the art of turning base metals into gold or gold into powder was lost, theart of turning a profit by exchanging and lending money was not. The appearanceof money on Earth is an amazing event and yet one that cannot be conventionallyexplained or documented. Most developments can be traced to some originatingsource, but money appeared in unconnected places across the world in remarkablysimilar fashion. Exchanging real goods and services for representations (todaypredominantly paper or electronic scrip) evolved into an art.Nowhere was the art of mastering money more developed than in the KhazarianEmpire. From Mesopotamia, the descendants of the Sumerian priesthood andleadership who fled the sudden and mysterious destruction of ancient Sumerspread southward into Palestine and Egypt and northward into the CaucasusMountain region. Here they mingled with nomadic Mongols, and their progenycenturies later formed the Empire of Khazaria, whence sprang the wealthy bankingfamilies of Europe. A few of them carried the secrets of ancient Mesopotamia. Itwas in Khazaria that nomadic raider clans attacked caravan routes between theBlack Sea and Caspian Sea, known historically as the Silk Road.In the fifth century, the Khazars rode with Attila the Hun. As they grew wealthyand powerful, the Khazar warlords determined that exchanging and loaning moneywould be more profitable and less hazardous than raiding caravans. But they hadone big problem. By the eighth century, Khazaria was almost evenly divided amongChristians, Muslims, and Jews. At that time, both Christians and Muslimsbelieved that charging interest on a loan, called usury, was a sin. Only Jewscould openly charge interest on loans, especially to non-Jews.In 740, Khazaria’s king Bulan, who claimed to have had a heavenly vision, becamethe first to adopt the religion of Judaism. By custom, everyone was expected toadopt the religion of their king, so every Khazar became a professed Jew,whether out of pragmatism or genuine religiosity. In 969, after enduring yearsof attacks from surrounding clans and nations, Khazaria was overrun byScandinavian migrants called the Rus and dissolved. The area came to be calledRussia.Arthur Koestler, a Jewish author and journalist who gained international famewith his history of the Jews, entitled The Thirteenth Tribe, fled Eastern Europeduring World War II and after a stay in Palestine, settled in Britain in 1945.Koestler, writing in 1978, stated that his book “was written before the fullextent of the holocaust was known, but that does not alter the fact that thelarge majority of surviving Jews in the world are of Eastern European—and thusperhaps mainly of Khazar—origin. If so, this would mean that their ancestorscame not from the Jordan but from the Volga, not from Canaan but from theCaucasus, once believed to be the cradle of the Aryan race; and that geneticallythey are more closely related to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar tribes than to theseed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Should this turn out to be the case, then theterm ‘anti-Semitism’ would become void of meaning, based on a misapprehensionshared by both the killers and their victims. The story of the Khazar Empire, asit slowly emerges from the past, begins to look like the most cruel hoax whichhistory has ever perpetrated.”About AD 1000, many displaced descendants of the Khazars migrated into Spain butwere ousted after a century or two. They then moved to Portugal, but after acentury or so were forced to move again. In the Netherlands, the Khazars, orAshkenazi Jews, as they came to call themselves, prospered and began to spreadacross Europe and then to America. These people were never connected to theHebrews of Palestine, although they were the originators of Zionism, a politicalmovement that began in nineteenth-century Russia for the purpose of securing aJewish “homeland” in the Middle East. As Koestler explained, “In the twelfthcentury there arose in Khazaria a Messianic movement, a rudimentary attempt at aJewish crusade, aimed at the conquest of Palestine by force of arms. Theinitiator of the movement was a Khazar Jew, one Solomon ben Duji (or Ruhi orRoy), aided by his son Menahem and a Palestinian scribe. They wrote letters toall the Jews, near and far, in all the lands around them. … They said that thetime had come in which God would gather Israel, His people, from all lands toJerusalem, the holy city, and that Solomon Ben Duji was Elijah, and his son theMessiah.” Duji’s movement later became known as Zionism.Later in life, Koestler was diagnosed with both Parkinson’s disease and cancer.Despite both having left notes of farewell, some conspiracy researchers claimthe 1983 suicide of Koestler and his wife, Cynthia Jefferies, were cleverassassinations by the Israeli Mossad in retaliation for his having revealed toomuch true history. It should be noted that the greatest opponents of Zionismwere Orthodox Jews, who did not believe it their place to take other people’slands but rather to await their Messiah. Some even claim that the Nazi Holocaustwas encouraged by some Zionists to eliminate Orthodox rabbinical leaders opposedto their movement.If the Khazars are the progenitors of many Eastern European Jews, then thiswould include the renowned Rothschild family, who financially ruled Europe formore than a century. Conspiracy researchers contend they still dominate theworld financial order and have been the financial backers of the Rockefellersand other wealthy families. The Rothschilds claim as an ancestor Nimrod, thegiant Sumerian king who was said to be a direct descendant of Noah as well as ademigod. Nimrod has also been associated with Molech, a variation of the Hebrewword for king or ruler. The name Molech has been applied to Sumerian deities.The biblical patriarch Abraham confronted Nimrod about his blasphemous worshipof Molech, simply a later name for the Anunnaki moon god Sin.This family’s cohesiveness, its power, its secrecy, and its wealth, all mightexplain why Mayer Rothschild believed his oft-repeated quote, “Permit me tocontrol the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.”When the founder of the Rothschild dynasty, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, wrote hiswill, he exerted the right of primogeniture, which means that only the eldestson in each generation can control the family wealth. By this method, not onlyhas the Rothschild family been held tightly together but, as in the secretsocieties, those family members who aren’t privy to the innermost control havelittle knowledge of its financial dealings. Former top executives of theRothschilds complained that they often were kept “out of the loop” on importantdecisions, so it is erroneous to blame the entire Rothschild family for lack ofethics.Rothschild biographer Derek Wilson described the staying power of the Rothschildfamily by stating, “Genetics, mythology, deliberate training, the opportunitiesprovided by wealth and connections—all have played their part in producing oneof the most remarkable—perhaps the [emphasis in the original] mostremarkable—family of recent history.” He concluded with admiration, “Fewdynasties, with the exception of hereditary monarchies preserved from oblivionby the right of primogeniture, have maintained their influence in the world forseven generations.”Jewish or not, globalist financiers have emulated the Rothschilds for decades,using secrecy and bribery to help them conduct business. Researcher JohnChurchilly wrote that “Americans should know Khazar descendants secretlydominate every aspect of American life. They have infiltrated the upper levelsof American government, industry, banking, finance, commerce, mass media,communications, real estate, merchandising, arts, education, sports,professional associations, etc. This is not by chance or merit but by design, acareful preference in selection over many, many decades.” Churchilly has voicedthe concerns of many. One key component of this management is secrecy. Utilizingbought-off politicians, who catch the public rage and scrutiny, major globalistsare able to operate out of the public eye, with impunity. This impunity is dueto their dominance in the field of communications, especially Hollywood, whichhas set cultural trends worldwide for decades. But is there any truth in it?“I have never been so upset by a poll in my life,” wrote Joel Stein in 2008. Acolumnist for the Los Angeles Times, Stein complained, “Only 22 percent ofAmericans now believe ‘the movie and television industries are pretty much runby Jews,’ down from nearly 50 percent in 1964. The Anti-Defamation League, whichreleased the poll results last month, sees in these numbers a victory againststereotyping. Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totallyrun Hollywood.”Stein went on to point out, “How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? When the studiochiefs took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago todemand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract, the open letter wassigned by: News Corp. President Peter Chernin (Jewish), Paramount PicturesChairman Brad Grey (Jewish), Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger(Jewish), Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton (surprise, Dutch Jew), WarnerBros. Chairman Barry Meyer (Jewish), CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves(so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel), MGM ChairmanHarry Sloan (Jewish) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker(mega-Jewish). If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group wouldhave not only the power to shut down all film production but to form a minyanwith enough Fiji water on hand to fill a mikvah. The person they were yelling atin that ad was SAG [Screen Actors Guild] President Alan Rosenberg (take aguess). The scathing rebuttal to the ad was written by entertainment super-agentAri Emanuel (Jew with Israeli parents) on the Huffington Post, which is owned byArianna Huffington (not Jewish and has never worked in Hollywood.)“As a proud Jew, I want America to know about our accomplishment,” concludedStein. “Yes, we control Hollywood. Without us, you’d be flipping between ‘The700 Club’ and ‘Davey and Goliath’ on TV all day. … But I don’t care if Americansthink we’re running the news media, Hollywood, Wall Street or the government. Ijust care that we get to keep running them.”Stein’s words were echoed in an opinion piece published in July 2012, in theTimes of Israel by Manny Friedman, admittedly an assumed name. Friedman wrotethat it is funny how statements like “The Jews control the media” incite Jews tobe up in arms. “We create huge campaigns to take these people down. We do whatwe can to put them out of work. We publish articles. We’ve created entireorganizations [such as AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee] thatexist just to tell everyone that the Jews don’t control nothin’. No, we don’tcontrol the media, we don’t have any more sway in DC than anyone else. No, no,no, we swear: We’re just like everybody else!” he wrote. But Friedman concludes,“The truth is, the anti-Semites got it right. We Jews have something planted ineach one of us that makes us completely different from every group in the world.We’re talking about a group of people that just got put in death camps, enduredpogroms, their whole families decimated. And then they came to America, the oneplace that ever really let them have as much power as they wanted, and suddenlythey’re taking over. Please don’t tell me that any other group in the world hasever done that. Only the Jews. And we’ve done it before. That’s why the Jewswere enslaved in Egypt. We were too successful. Go look at the Torah—it’s rightthere. And we did it in Germany too. … We no longer have to change our names. Weno longer have to blend in like chameleons. We own a whole freaking country.”But Friedman adds that with such power in the public media comes graveresponsibility, stating, “It means that they’re suddenly culpable when theycreate dirty TV shows that sully the spiritual atmosphere of the world. It meansthat things can’t just be created for the sake of amusement or fun or even‘art.’ … We’ll have to start thinking about the things we create and the way weact. It means we’ll have to start working together. It means we’ll have to holdone another, and ourselves, to a higher standard.Screenwriter and actor Ben Stein wrote of receiving a call from an editor at 60Minutes, who wanted his opinion on their research indicating that 60 percent ofthe most important positions in Hollywood were held by Jews. “I managed todisqualify myself by saying that while Hollywood was not really ‘run’ by anyone(it’s far too chaotic for that), if Jews were about 2.5 percent of thepopulation and were about 60 percent of Hollywood, they might well be said to beextremely predominant in that sector,” said Stein. “That was far too logical andun-PC an answer, and I never heard from her again.” Stein admitted, “Hollywood’scurrent product occasionally repels and even sickens me. I am truly disgustedwith its language, its violence, its endless attacks on businessmen and militaryofficers. (On the other hand, it never can attack the CIA enough for me.)” Buthe concluded, “For now, Hollywood, in many ways the most successful culturalenterprise of all time and the most potent messenger of American values of alltime, is changing, but it is still largely Jewish. And a very angry voice in mycurly head makes me add, ‘What the hell of it?’ ”It must be noted that all Jewish Semites, or even those professing the religionof Judaism, are not the problem. The problem of attempts at overreaching controlstem from the adherents of Zionism, a political movement embraced by manynon-Semites, including the Rothschilds.The Rothschild fortune began in the 1700s, when Mayer Amschel adopted thepractice of fractional-reserve banking, the practice of lending out more moneythan one has in assets. According to G. Edward Griffin, author of The Creaturefrom Jekyll Island, as the Rothschilds “matured and learned the magic ofconverting debt into money, they moved beyond the confines of Frankfurt, andestablished additional operations in the financial centers, not only of Europe,but of much of the civilized world.”But did they just discover the magic of converting debt into money, or had thispractice been passed along from distant ancestors? Like their proclaimedAnunnaki ancestor Nimrod and other Anunnaki, the Rothschilds have had aparticular interest in gold. According to Rothschild biographer Derek Wilson,“They became the major importers of bullion from the newly-discoveredgoldfields.” The Rothschilds also financed Cecil Rhodes, who became the gold anddiamond magnate of South Africa and later formed a secret society called theRound Tables, forerunner of the Council on Foreign Relations.Journalist William T. Still said the family’s creation of American wealth was“profound.” “Working through the Wall Street firms of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and J.P.Morgan Co., the Rothschilds financed John D. Rockefeller so that he could createthe Standard Oil empire.” According to testimony in congressional hearings, theNational City Bank of Cleveland provided John D. Rockefeller with the money tobegin his monopolization of the oil refinery business, resulting in theformation of Standard Oil. This bank was one of three Rothschild banks in theUnited States, and by the late 1800s, Standard Oil totally dominated the world’spetroleum industry.Railroad magnate Edward Harriman and steel industrialist Andrew Carnegie alsoreceived funding from the Rothschilds. The Harrimans, aside from mentoringPrescott Bush, the grandfather of former president George W. Bush, also foundedthe eugenics movement in the United States. Together with the Carnegies, theyfunded some of the nation’s most prestigious foundations.The 1917 Balfour Declaration, a letter by British foreign secretary AlfredBalfour affirming Britain had no objection to a Jewish state in Palestine, waslater approved as a mandate by the League of Nations. Many acknowledge thisletter as the foundation for the creation of the state of Israel. Balfour’sdeclaration originally was a reply to a leading Zionist, Baron WalterRothschild, the first English nobleman peer to not convert from Judaism. Mostaffected by this declaration was the Semitic Arab population in Palestine.Pete Papaherakles, writing in the American Free Press, wondered if bankersdesiring control over the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran (CBI)might be one of the primary reasons Iran was being singled out as an enemy bythe Western and Israeli powers? It has been noted that Iran is one of only threecountries left in the world whose central bank is not under Rothschild control.Prior to the 9/11 attacks, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea,and Iran were free of Rothschild-dominated Western banks. By 2012, all wereunder a central bank with the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Iran. InLibya, a Rothschild bank was established in Benghazi even before fighting endedwithin that country in 2011.In addressing the banking aspect of the saber rattling against Iran, it wasnoted that the concern over Iran possibly building one nuclear weapon ismisplaced in light of the nuclear arsenals in Israel, Pakistan, and India. “Whatthen is the real reason?” asked Papaherakles. “Is it the trillions to be made inoil profits, or the trillions in war profits? Is it to bankrupt the U.S.economy, or is it to start World War III? Is it to destroy Israel’s enemies orto destroy the Iranian central bank so that no one is left to defy Rothschild’smoney racket? It might be any one of those reasons or, worse—it might be all ofthem.”IT RUNS IN THE GENES [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s66]The Rothschilds are only the most visible of those who consider themselvesordained to serve as masters over ordinary humans. The blue bloods, as they seethemselves, are born leaders due to their bloodline. Only within white bloodcells can be found human DNA, the blueprint of life, and today, researchers havesuggested that some genes within white-blood-cell DNA may be fromextraterrestrials. Such alien genetics might confirm the Sumerian accounts ofvisitation and intervention in antiquity by nonhumans.The evidence for nonhuman genes within the blood is strong. Mammalian red bloodcells primarily carry oxygen to body tissue but not DNA, as these cells do nothave nuclei and are expelled during the maturation process. However, the nucleiof human white blood cells do contain DNA. Not only does the human body rely onDNA, but so do most living things, including plants, animals, and bacteria. Blood can be typed because of the DNA contained in our white blood cells.After reviewing the latest discoveries in DNA and gene sequencing, one sciencewriter pointed out that humans are suspected to contain only about 32,000 genes,which is much less than science’s first estimate of 100,000. Oddly, out of ourgene pool, we share 223 genes with bacteria. These are genes that do not existin other life-forms, such as worms, flies, or even yeast. Researchers thoughtsome ancient vertebrate genome took on bacterial genes in the same way thatcertain types of bacteria take in genes in a response to their environment.“What a comedown from the pinnacle of the genomic Tree of Life!” remarkedSitchin. “In other words: At a relatively recent time as evolution goes, modernhumans acquired an extra 223 genes not through gradual evolution, not verticallyon the Tree of Life, but horizontally, as a sideways insertion of geneticmaterial from bacteria … 223 genes is more than two thirds of the differencebetween me, you and a chimpanzee!”The mysterious appearance of these genes has vexed researchers who adhere toconventional theories of evolution. Steven Scherer, director for mapping of theHuman Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine, acknowledged theseextra genes are “a jump that does not follow current evolutionary theories.”Equally perplexing is rhesus or Rh-negative blood, a term that designates theabsence of a certain protein on the surface of red blood cells, a rarecircumstance in the thirty human blood types. The Rh-negative phenotype ispassed through the DNA of both parents. Oddly, a person with type O-negativeblood is considered a universal donor, who can donate blood to anyone,regardless of blood type, without causing a transfusion reaction.The Rh-negative blood type is considered a mutation of unknown origin, though itis theorized to have somehow originated in Europe about twenty-five thousand tothirty thousand years ago. Roslyn M. Frank of the University of Iowa noted thatthe Basques, an ethnic group centered in the western Pyrenees, between Spain andFrance, have the highest recorded level of Rh-negative blood. Some suspect thatthey are the original source of the Rh-negative blood type, although otherpopulations with small populations of Rh-negative individuals are found in theeastern half of Asia, Madagascar, Australia, and New Zealand. Here again isevidence that something was occurring worldwide in the distant past.The Basques had advanced navigational skills and technology even before the riseof the Roman Empire. In addition, the Basque language cannot be connected to anyother human tongue. Frank believed that the Basques might be the last remnantsof the megalith builders, who left behind dolmens, standing stones, and otherrock structures. They may even have foraged in North America, as recentlydiscovered British customs records show large Basque imports of beaver pelts inthe period 1380–1433, long before Columbus sailed. But the tale of human originslinked to extraterrestrials gains even more strength when one considers thatmany Rh-negative children are born with a tail. The cauda equina is a nervebundle extending beyond the spinal column. Some babies are born with an extendedcauda equina, in essence a tail, which must be surgically removed at birth. Theword cauda is Latin for tail. In astrological terms, the cauda draconis meansthe “dragon’s tail,” the point at which the moon’s orbit passes below theecliptic, and signifies malefic aspects.Researcher Patty Boyer, among those questioning the relatively sudden appearanceof Rh-negative blood, wrote, “The introduction of the RH-negative blood type wasnot a naturally occurring part of human evolution. This would lend credence thatthe RH-negative factor was introduced from an outside source. Could the sourcebe from human-like beings from another planet? Or maybe we are just as alien asthey are, in that, we are a product of their manipulation and interference.Could they have come here and manipulated life forms already present on earth tocreate modern man?” she asked, adding, “I suggest that man is a creation of ahighly technological race of human-like beings that From the Heavens to theEarth came. I suggest that these advanced beings are still among us today andare still very active in the affairs of man.”THE BLACK NOBILITY [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s67]With the fall of the great empires, the descendants of the early priests andmoney changers rose to power in Venice. These Venetians intermarried withexisting European royalty, gained power, and became known as the Black Nobility,both because of their generally antisocial behavior and their usurpation ofroyal titles.Prior to the rise of the Rothschild dynasty, the secrets of money manipulationpassed down from Sumer and Babylon found a home within the infamous Medicifamily of Italy, who virtually ruled Venice from the 1420s to 1737. The Medicisprovided the world with at least four popes—Leo X, Clement VII, Pius IV, and LeoXI—a number of cardinals, and two queens of France. Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medicifounded the Medici Bank, which grew into an early multinational corporation. Totheir credit, the Medicis also provided the financing for both Leonardo de Vinciand Christopher Columbus.The Medicis, along with other oligarchic families of Venice and Genoa, gainedpower through their monopolies, or “privileged trading rights,” and marriageswith royalty. By the late twelfth century, this group had gained control overVenice and the commerce of most of the Western world.The Illuminati News website states, “These people earned the title of ‘Black’nobility from their ruthless lack of scruple. They employed murder, rape,kidnapping, assassination, robbery, and all manner of deceit on a grand scale,brooking no opposition to attaining their objectives. They all have immensewealth. And money is power. The most powerful of the Black Nobility families arelocated in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Britain, Holland, and Greece in thatorder. Their roots may be traced back to the Venetian oligarchs [led by theMedicis], who are of Khazar extraction, and married into these royal houses inthe early part of the twelfth century. Following a great Khazar victory over theArabs, the future Emperor, Constantine V, married a Khazar princess and theirson became Emperor Leo IV, also known as ‘Leo the Khazar.’ The Medicci popes,and Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli) were Khazars, as is the present Pope, John PaulII. Not all Black Nobility are of royal houses, and many of the royal familiesno longer have kingdoms.” As with many of the secret societies discussed in thisbook, the Black Nobility also may trace their lineage back to ancient Sumer.These Venetians originally called themselves Sepharvaim, which is a term derivedfrom the collective names of two Mesopotamian cities also known as the Sippara,or the “booktowns”—that is, repositories of knowledge. One was on the east bankof the Euphrates and the other was the capital of Sargon I, where a greatlibrary was established.By the mid-1500s, the Medicis had added the arts and alchemy to their bankinginterests. Illustrating the interconnectedness of the bloodline families,Francesco I de Medici, the second Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1565 wed Joanna ofAustria, youngest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and Anna of Bohemiaand Hungary. He supported artists; he built the Medici Theater and founded theAccademia della Crusca. Francesco also began practicing alchemy, an interest inwhich he was joined by his stepbrother Don Giovanni de Medici. In the early1600s, Don Giovanni worked with his palace librarian, Jewish scholar BenedettoBlanis, in the forbidden areas of astrology, alchemy, and the kabbalah.During the Middle Ages, the Black Nobility aligned with the papacy—theirtraditional enemy—to stop a common foe. A family dynasty of German kings calledthe Hohenstaufens had arisen, and one Hohenstaufen in particular, Frederick I,was bent on conquest. Frederick, commonly known as Frederick Barbarossa,literally Redbeard in Italian, led his forces to Italy and eventually wascrowned emperor in 1155. But after the Black Nobility and the papacy pushedFrederick out, he returned to Germany to fight his Welf cousin, Duke Heinrich(Henry the Lion) of Saxony and Bavaria in 1180.The conflict between Frederick and the other German princes, led by the Welffamily, resulted in a major rift. The supporters of the Welfs were calledGuelphs, an Italianized version of Welf, while those who supported Frederickwere called Ghibellines, a name derived from an old battle cry. With the deathof Frederick while on crusade, his supporters lost the advantage and theGuelphs, with the backing of the Black Nobility and the pope, went on to supportWilliam of Orange when he took the throne of England. This eventually resultedin the formation of the Bank of England and the East India Company, the twomajor English financial powers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Working through a number of trusts, or corporations, large banks, and abewildering number of secret societies, the wealthy elite managed a long seriesof financial manipulations behind the booms and busts of the 1800s. They havebeen accused of creating the Federal Reserve System in the United States,fomenting World Wars I and II, the Great Depression, and the ups and downs ofthe U.S. economy leading to the meltdown of 2008."},{"pageContent":"PART IV [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt04]THE MODERN ERA [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#pt04]For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the politicalspectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter withCastro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claimwe wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe weare part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the UnitedStates, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiringwith others around the world to build a more integrated global and politicalstructure—one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I amproud of it.DAVID ROCKEFELLER, MEMOIRS THE FOUNDATIONAL BELIEF OF THE RULING ELITE IS THAT THEY were born to rule,while the vast majority of the populace is born to slavery, in one form oranother. They see this as a natural consequence of their bloodline, or theirblue blood, as it has been called. The term refers to the blood flowing in theveins of old, aristocratic families and may be derived from the blue veins seenon people of light skin tone or from the old Hindu gods, who were alwaysdepicted as blue in color. Where did they get the idea that most humans are bornto be serfs or slaves? From the tyranny of the Anunnaki gods to the philosophyof Aristotle, who saw slavery as a necessary institution, to the wealthy eliteof today, who cling to the simplistic Darwinian belief in survival of thefittest, the inheritors of wealth and privilege view themselves as God-ordainedrulers of humankind.HITLER AND THE BLUE BLOODS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s68]And according to a growing number of conspiracy researchers, those causing theproblems can all be traced back to thirteen to fifteen families who are allinterconnected by blood. Webster Griffin Tarpley, James Higham, John Coleman,Ralph Epperson, and others have identified the intermarried families connectedto the Black Nobility. The old-line ruling families “believe that they have theright to rule the world because they are descended from the emperors of theancient Roman and so-called ‘holy’ Roman Empires,” wrote Tarpley and Higham.According to these authors, these families include the Rothschilds, theRockefellers, the Warburgs, the Lazards, the Seafs, the Goldmans, the Morgans,the Schroeders, the Bushes, and the Harrimans.Tarpley and Higham offered other names, rarely heard in the United States,including “the Giustiniani family, of Rome and Venice, who trace their lineageto the Emperor Justinian; Sir Jocelyn Hambro of Hambros (Merchant) Bank;Pierpaolo Luzzatti Fequiz, whose lineage dates back six centuries to the mostancient Luzzatos, of Venice, and Umberto Ortolani of the ancient Black Nobilityfamily of the same name.” They identified a number of other old Venetian BlackNobility names, tracing their lineages back to Roman senators and noblemen. Likemany other wealthy families, these names are largely unknown to the public,including some family members, due to the inordinate secrecy used to cloak boththeir activities and their history. But occasionally there are glimpses of whatreally goes on within family circles.It is shocking but possible that one unexpected member of this Black Nobility,and the Rothschild family in particular, was none other than the Nazi führer,Adolf Hitler. This astounding information came from Walter C. Langer, apsychologist who produced a wartime psychoanalysis of Hitler for the OSS. Langerreported that a secret prewar Austrian police report proved that Hitler’s fatherwas the illegitimate son of a young peasant cook named Maria Anna Schicklgruber,who at the time she conceived her child was “employed as a servant in the homeof Baron [Salomon] Rothschild” in Vienna. Rothschild biographer Ferguson statedthat the son of one of Salomon’s senior clerks recalled that by the 1840s,Salomon Rothschild “had developed a somewhat reckless enthusiasm for younggirls.”Upon learning of her pregnancy in 1837, Maria left Vienna and gave birth toHitler’s father of record, Alois. Five years later, she reportedly married anitinerant miller named Johann Georg Hiedler. Yet Alois carried his mother’s nameof Schicklgruber until nearly forty years of age, when Hiedler’s brother, JohannNepomuk Hiedler, offered him legitimacy. Due to the illegible writing of aparish priest in changing the birth register, the name Hiedler became Hitler,either by mistake or to confuse authorities. Alois Hitler, a governmentbureaucrat, married his second cousin, Klara Pölzl, in 1885, after obtainingspecial Episcopal dispensation. Adolf was born in Braunau, Austria, in 1889,when Alois was fifty-two years old.In the late 1930s, Hitler’s English nephew, William Patrick Hitler, hinted tonewsmen about the German leader’s Jewish background. Hitler’s personal attorney,Hans Frank, confirmed this scandalous information but reported that the fatherof Alois had the last name Frankenberger instead of Rothschild. When no recordof a Frankenberger could be found in Vienna, the matter was quietly dropped byall but Hitler. Historians have long noted that the question of possible Jewishancestry haunted Hitler throughout his life. “It is possible that Hitlerdiscovered his Jewish background and his relation to the Rothschilds, and awareof their enormous power to make or break European governments, re-establishedcontact with the family,” wrote Ralph Epperson. “This would partially explainthe enormous support he received from the international banking fraternity,closely entwined with the Rothschild family, as he rose to power.”This incredible story might be written off as wartime propaganda except for thefact that the OSS never made this story public, indicating that the tale mayhave been considered too sensitive to make public, even as propaganda.A UNIQUE GOLD BOOK [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s69]If Hitler indeed carried Rothschild blood, he also may have been part of theroyal Habsburg line. At the turn of the twentieth century, Emperor Franz Josefof Austria self-published an extraordinary book, bound in green leather with agold-tipped binding, engraved and embossed from plates of copper, steel, andzinc. It was titled An ehren und an siegen Reich, which in translation means“Toward an Honorable and Victorious Reich.” It was a handmade, one-of-a-kindbook, and apparently no more than five copies were printed. Readership waslimited to Habsburg family members.The volume provided a detailed history of the Habsburgs and the Holy RomanEmpire, and it predicted the coming of an Austrian-German superstate. Eachchapter had a different design and topic, covering the various aspects of thenation’s history. One of these copies ended up in the hands of Adolf Hitler, whokept it secured during World War II, perhaps in deference to his own familyhistory.At the end of the war, a British soldier found the book in the ruins of Hitler’schancellery and took it as a souvenir. In the late 1980s, this fellow died, andthe book was passed to the man’s son. The son did not know the full worth of thebook, but he realized that it was expensive. He explained the book’s history andgave it to Jim Delittoso of Phoenix, Arizona, to repay a loan he had used toreturn to Ireland and bury his father.Delittoso had the book appraised by Abe Feder, a Phoenix book appraiser who onceworked for the Museum of Natural History in New York City. In 1997, Federstudied the book for several months. At least two persons participated in itstranslation. Feder told this author, “I have never seen a book like this.”Feder’s appraisal of the book essentially was that it was “priceless.”In March 1999, the book disappeared. A business associate of Delittoso hadborrowed it to use as collateral for a loan, and then the person who made theloan allowed a business partner to borrow the book. This fellow sold the book toanother man for an undisclosed price. This man, in turn, sold it to anotherperson, whose name has never become known, and the book was gone, althoughseveral persons had handled it and photographs of some pages remain. Some havespeculated that someone during this process realized the importance of the bookand secreted it away. The amazing story recounted in this uncommon book is howthe Habsburg line was joined with a Jewish bloodline during the time of theThird Crusade.The book recorded that Frederick I Barbarossa, crowned emperor of the Holy RomanEmpire in 1155, had a sickly son named Albrecht I by his wife Margaret, daughterof King Gustav of Sweden. Frederick took his family with him to the Holy Landwhile on crusade and there took a Jewish wife named Rebeccah, who bore him ason, whom he named Albrecht II. Frederick Barbarossa died before returning home,and Albrecht I was killed by assassins. Eventually his wife Margaret andAlbrecht II returned to Germany, where Albrecht started a lineage that includedAlbrecht III and IV. Eventually, Albrecht’s lineage led to the EmperorMaximillian and the later Habsburg line.Franz Joseph’s book indicates that the Rothschild family is a part of thebloodline stemming from Albrecht II, meaning that the Habsburgs and theRothschilds shared a common Jewish ancestor. This part of the Habsburg historywas carefully hidden during the years that anti-Semitism grew in Europe.Apparently, in commissioning this extraordinary book, Emperor Franz Josef haddecided it was time that the entire family learned of their heritage. Somesuspect that this untold history may have been known within the Rothschildfamily, which could go far in explaining their support for later German regimes.Blue bloods believe that, due to their ancestry, they have a right to controlothers. Perhaps it has been the attempts at such control that kept the humanrace constantly on the move. After leaving the cradle of civilization in ancientSumer, humans moved into the Caucasus Mountains and spread throughout Europe,while others moved into Egypt and Palestine. What drove people to leaveestablished homes and travel to strange and distant lands?Historians have been clear that people migrated to escape political andreligious tyranny. It is unarguable that throughout human history, tyrants haveattempted to corral and subjugate the human population. Throughout our history,rulers from the pharaohs and caesars to European royals and even the GermanNazis have filled the roles of these tyrants. What made them so confident thattheir role was to rule others? And why were these tyrants so concerned about thesanctity of their bloodline? Could it be that they were genetically connected tothe early sky gods and that they wanted to maintain this connection?NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s70]From time immemorial, religion has been the first-choice method of control ofpopulations by the blue blood elite. “God ordained me to tell you how to liveand what to tithe” was the word from religious authorities from ancient Sumer tothe present day. Since its formation, the Roman Church has perpetrated a numberof crimes—including the massacres of the Cathars and Native Americans, theCrusades, the Inquisition and the killing of those deemed “witches” and“heretics,” and the church’s cozy relationship with Hitler’s Third Reich and itsattendant Holocaust. The Church has also been quite good at covering its tracks.Barbara G. Walker, award-winning author of the Women’s Encyclopedia of Myths andSecrets, has pointed to Henry Charles Lea’s 1888 study of the Inquisition, AHistory of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages, as being illustrative of Churchpractices. “Even in his time, Lea said, Vatican authorities were alreadybeginning secretly to destroy most of these damning records. The Inquisition wasthe worst holocaust in European history; it lasted nearly five centuries; andyet the church was succeeding in misrepresenting its extent and its impact intheir official histories. This was my earliest realization of patriarchy’spropensity to lie itself into respectability.”Adding to Walker’s insight, New Zealand researcher Martin Doutré stated, “We’redeluding ourselves if we think we live in some kind of ‘bright new age’ ofenlightenment and that the ‘Dark Ages’ passed into memory centuries ago. Thepowerbase that ran the Inquisitions was never dismantled and remains morestrongly in place today than ever, controlling, directing, misleading,deceiving, suppressing, propagandizing, war mongering, persecuting, dominatingand exploiting, etc., etc.”Doutré pointed to the church’s persecution of Galileo as a classic example ofreligious perfidy. The aging astronomer-mathematician simply tried to explainthat the Earth revolved around the sun and not vice versa as presented in churchdogma, but was finally forced to recant before the court of Inquisition ratherthan end his days in the torturer’s dungeon.During the time of the Inquisition, church authorities taught the ignorantmasses that the Earth was flat. The educated aristocrats of the time knewbetter, but a flat Earth suited their purposes, because it kept the populationfrom straying too far from their grasp. The educated also knew that somethingwas amiss with conventional history, but they didn’t want to probe this subjecttoo far. After all, the Inquisition’s racks were always ready for new victims.It’s not all that much better today.YOU CAN BANK ON THIS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s71]Since at least the time of the Babylonians, religious institutions have reliedon financial institutions. The pattern involved blending the finances of moneychangers with the prevailing religion as if money was God-ordained.The Roman Empire, especially after Christianity became the official statereligion, accelerated the spread of the money changers, whose reach extendedinto the highest levels of Roman society. “The result,” according to Joseph P.Farrell, “was that the Mesopotamian and Syrian money changers and merchantseffectively colonized Rome’s provinces bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Romanbanking was all but monopolized in their hands as the influence of Mesopotamianmystery cults extended throughout the Empire, and the activities of the templecontinued to be associated with commerce.”Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the money changers moved into northernEurope. In 1602, the Dutch chartered the Dutch East India Company, and theybegan to settle South Africa. William of Orange, scion of one of the elite Dutchbloodlines, in 1688 invaded England and became King William III. In 1691,William initiated the growth of the global banking system by creating the Bankof England, which led to the growth of the British Empire. By 1820, theRothschild banking dynasty had gained control of the Bank of England, thanks toloans made to Prince Regent George Augustus Frederick (note the historicalnature of these names), later King George IV, by Nathan Rothschild.“[The] expansion of the British and other European empires to all parts of theworld exported the bloodlines to every continent, including, most importantlytoday, North America,” commented David Icke.The advent of the printing press led to the Renaissance and the Age ofEnlightenment and thus the decline of the Roman Church, as it also allowed forthe printing of the Bible, as well as paper money. Before printed paper money,gold, silver, and copper coins, beads, shells, and even sticks of wood were usedas currency. After the invention of printing, paper money began to replacereligion as the primary control mechanism of the elite.During the reign of England’s King Henry I, people used tally sticks, notchescarved into wood or bone, to represent numbers or quantities. Wooden tallysticks were split in half. The piece that bore the notches was kept by the kingas protection against counterfeiting; the other half circulated as money. Talleysticks were accepted in payment for taxes, and not only were they used by thepublic, but they were in great demand.The tally system worked well for 726 years, but any currency aside from silverand gold is only as good as the faith people place in it. Today no one remembersthe stick system. When the Bank of England was formed in 1694, its shareholders,the money changers of their day, whose names were kept secret, realized thattally sticks represented money outside their power, which is exactly what KingHenry had intended.Unbelievable as it sounds, these shareholders bought stock in the bank with thenotched pieces of wood, then proceeded to slowly eliminate that system in favorof Bank of England notes. The use of tally sticks continued until 1826. In 1834,the remaining sticks were ordered burned. Ironically, the stove used to burn thesticks in the Houses of Parliament went out of control, gutting the Palace ofWestminster. It was the largest blaze in London since the Great Fire of 1666.Thanks to fractional-reserve banking, the shareholders of the bank lent out muchmore money than they had on hand, and by backing wars and revolutions, such asOliver Cromwell’s overthrow of King Charles, they became so wealthy that theytook over a square mile of property still known as the City of London. The City(as opposed to London proper), Wall Street in New York City, and Zurich remainthe three dominant financial centers of the world today.One example of manipulating a money system, which paralleled the recent economicscandals in the United States yet predated the founding of the nation, was knownas the Great South Sea Bubble of 1721. The South Sea Company, a British jointstock company founded in 1711, was granted a monopoly to trade with Spain’sSouth American colonies. Speculators ran up the price of stock from about £100to more than £1,000 per share. The government encouraged such speculation byeliminating taxes on dividends and allowing women to own stock, one of the fewforms of property that women could possess in their own right.In 1719, the company proposed to purchase half the public debt of Britain withthe promise to lower the interest rate. It was said that everyone would benefit.Speculation led to a gigantic economic bubble that finally burst in 1721,ruining most investors and crashing the company’s stock. In the ensuinginvestigation, fraud by the company’s directors was found, as well as corruptionwithin the British cabinet.Despite popular myth, the American colonial revolt against England occurred moreover concern for its own currency than a small tax on tea. During a visit toBritain in 1763, Benjamin Franklin was asked about the prosperity of theAmerican colonists by officials of the Bank of England. Franklin explained,“That is simple. In the colonies, we issue our own money. It is called ColonialScrip.We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry tomake the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In thismanner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasingpower, and we have no interest to pay to no one.”Franklin later stated, “The colonies would gladly have borne the little tax ontea and other matters had it not been that England took away from the coloniestheir money, which created unemployment and dissatisfaction. The inability ofcolonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands ofGeorge III and the international bankers was the prime reason for theRevolutionary War.” The American revolutionists knew that to gain true freedom,they had to break the power of the Rothschild-dominated Bank of England, whichhad outlawed their money—colonial script based on goods and services—in favor ofinterest-bearing Bank of England notes.By the mid-1800s, the bankers of Europe had gone worldwide, despite theirsetback in North America due to the American Revolution. But they didn’t give upin their attempts to regain control of the United States and may in fact havebeen instrumental in influencing the course of events leading to the Civil War.German chancellor Otto von Bismarck once stated, “The division of the UnitedStates into federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War bythe high financial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the UnitedStates, if they remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economicand financial independence, which would upset their financial domination overthe world. The voice of the Rothschilds prevailed. … Therefore they sent theiremissaries into the field to exploit the question of slavery and to open anabyss between the two sections of the Union.”For some years, the Rothschilds financed major projects in the United States onboth sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. Nathan Rothschild, who owned a largeManchester textile plant, bought his cotton from Southern interests and financedthe importation of Southern cotton prior to the war. At the same time, wroteRothschild biographer Wilson, “He had made loans to various states of the Union,and had been, for a time, the official European banker for the US government andwas a pledged supporter of the Bank of the United States.”The War Between the States was more over economics than slavery, despite howmodern political correctness aims to convince otherwise. And it was encouragedthrough secret societies, especially the Knights of the Gold Circle, of whichJohn Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, was a member.Abraham Lincoln was more concerned with preserving the federal union thanfreeing slaves. In late 1862, he proclaimed, “My paramount object in thisstruggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if Icould save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save itby freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do aboutslavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.…”Lincoln understood that the true reason for sectional friction in the UnitedStates was not slavery, but the fact that the South desired to buy less-costlyimported European products even though the powerful Northern manufacturers hadimposed stiff import tariffs. These tariffs were raised even higher afterSouthern congressmen left Washington in 1861. The industrial North, fillingrapidly with immigrants willing to work for a pittance, had no need for slaves,while the major planters of the agrarian South were totally dependent on humanlabor. Although antislavery advocates in both North and South realized thattechnological advances meant the demise of slavery was only a matter of time,extremists on both sides, encouraged by agents of the European financiers,continually fanned the fires of discontent, and war became inevitable. Many ofthe famous American wealthy families enriched themselves from Lincoln’s GreatWar.Lincoln may have failed to recall that the first assassination attempt on anAmerican president was against Andrew Jackson, who incurred the wrath of theinternational bankers by abolishing the country’s central bank. In need of moneyto fund the war effort, Lincoln turned from those lenders and, instead ofborrowing from the European banks as expected, in 1862 issued about $450 millionin currency printed with green ink and thus called greenbacks. This paper money,legalized by an act of Congress with nothing to back it, was debt-free fiatmoney. Lincoln saw the debt-free creation of money as government’s greatestcreative opportunity. But he also found that it was fatal to cross theinternational bankers. He was shot by John Wilkes Booth while attending Ford’sTheatre on April 14, 1865, and died the next morning.The money changers of Europe gained even greater power during World War I, whenmany of Europe’s royal houses lost their leadership positions. Their greatestfear came with the rise of communism in Russia. Although the Bolsheviks wereaided in their revolution against the czar by Western bankers, the bankers’control slipped when Stalin ascended to dictatorial power following Lenin’sdeath in 1924. With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, wealthy and titledRussians fled to Western nations, warning of the dangers to capitalism frominternational communism. Great fear was engendered among the wealthy. The cry of“Workers of the world, unite!” reverberated within Communist parties from Berlinand Paris to London and New York.It may well have been the post–World War I plan of the banker elite to create asocialist East and pit it against the capitalist West, but the fear of thespread of communism caused a change in plans. Something had to be done to haltthe spread of communist socialism, and Germany was in a central position to actas a barrier.However, something first had to be done with the democratic Weimar Republic inGermany. One solution was to combine American capitalism with Germancorporations in the 1920s under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, whichostensibly were plans to help Germany repay its debt after World War I. Theseplans used American loans to create and consolidate the German steel andchemical giants, Vereinigte Stahlwerke and IG Farben, both major supporters ofthe fledgling Nazi Party. Both plans were described by historian Carroll Quigleyas “largely a J.P. Morgan production.”FOLLOW THE LEADER [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s72]The final solution was to finance an Austrian Army corporal who was drawing payas an undercover agent for his military superiors after his failed attempts asan artist. This, of course, was Adolf Hitler, who gained power through thebacking of both the occult Thule Society, composed of German aristocrats andwealthy industrialists, as well as Western banking interests. Over the course ofseveral years, the former corporal brought his National Socialist German WorkersParty (the Nazis) from a handful of members to a national organization ofmillions.In early 1933, Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. In 1934, with the deathof President Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler consolidated his office with that ofpresident and assumed the title of führer, or leader of the entire nation.But then Hitler made a fatal error—the same one that may have cost the life ofLincoln. He failed to follow the wishes of the moneyed elite to borrow moneyfrom the international bankers. Instead, he issued his own debt-free money,reichsmarks, and put the Germans back to work on public projects such as theautobahn highway system and the production of war materials.In early Nazi meetings, Hitler had listened to the views of German economistGottfried Feder, who advocated monetary control through a nationalized centralbank rather than private banks and believed that financial interests hadenslaved the population by controlling the money supply. One of the platforms ofthe Nazi Party was the breaking of “debt-slavery”—in other words, interestpayments.“When listening to Gottfried Feder’s first lecture about the ‘Breaking of theTyranny of Interest,’ I knew immediately that the question involved was atheoretical truth which would reach enormous importance for the German people’sfuture,” wrote Hitler in Mein Kampf. “ … Germany’s development already stoodbefore my eyes too clearly for me not to know that the hardest battle had to befought, not against hostile nations, but rather against international capital. …The fight against international finance and loan capital has become the mostimportant point in the program of the German nation’s fight for its independenceand freedom.” Unfortunately, Hitler’s view narrowed from all internationalfinance to only internal Jewish finance.In 1933, Germany, like America, was in the depths of the Great Depression. Alarge segment of the population was out of work, and the money hyperinflated.Many recall the stories of Germans needing a wheelbarrow loaded with paper moneyto buy a single loaf of bread. By the time of the 1936 Berlin Olympics—a merethree years later—Germany had become an economic powerhouse, with nearly fullemployment and stable money, thanks to its freedom from the internationalbankers. However, the wealthy elite, whose secrets came from ancient Sumer,could not afford to have the rest of the world see the benefits of theinterest-free money sought by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and manyothers throughout history.Winston Churchill, a member of the aristocratic and wealthy elite, summed uptheir reaction to Hitler’s actions during World War II when he stated, “You mustunderstand that this war is not against Hitler or National Socialism but againstthe [economic] strength of the German people, which must be smashed once and forall, regardless whether it is in the hands of Hitler or a Jesuit priest.”One may ask, if Lincoln was assassinated for bypassing the internationalbankers, weren’t there assassination attempts on Hitler, who did the same? Onlyabout two dozen. But unlike Lincoln, Hitler was surrounded by loyalists who kepthim protected even from his own generals. It took the strength of more than twodozen nations combined in a world war to stop Hitler and his plans for athousand-year Reich.The Germans lost the war, but the wealthy elite, who had funded Hitler and theNazis, did not. In fact, in many ways, they won. The Nazis experimented with newtechnology in nuclear science, energy manipulation, psychiatric drugs, andinnovative techniques of propaganda and mind control, all of which helped theelite. They learned the best ways to overthrow nations, dumb down populationswith fluoride and other chemical agents, and how to insinuate fear, torture, andassassination into a civilized society. They brought all this, along withthousands of unrepentant Nazis, to America under a variety of programs,including Operation Paperclip, which recruited former Nazi scientists andbrought them to the United States. All of this helped them create their newpolice state.A number of events in America during the first part of the twenty-first centuryeerily paralleled the National Socialist takeover of Germany in the 1930s. Inboth nations, an attack on a prominent building led to rushed legislationreducing civil liberties, followed by the gradual erosion of civil law, themilitarization of the police, torture, indefinite detention, and war. In Berlin,the Reichstag, Germany’s parliament building, was set ablaze in early 1933. Ahalf-wit named Marinus van der Lubbe was arrested and, after torture, confessedto setting the fire alone. After the disaster, the German president vonHindenberg blamed the communists for a conspiracy and declared many key civilliberties of German citizens nullified. The legislature then passed the EnablingAct, which allowed Hitler in his role as chancellor to consolidate all of thecountry’s legislative powers in his hands, effectively making Germany’sconstitution moot. Hitler also consolidated all of Germany’s police agenciesunder the pretext of fatherland security. Similarly, in the United States in thefirst years of the twenty-first century, the World Trade Center towers weredestroyed, blame was placed on terrorists—this time they were Middle Easternfanatics—and the PATRIOT Act was passed by Congress, effectively limiting civilliberties in the United States and allowing the government greater license tomonitor its citizens. This was followed by the creation of the Department ofHomeland Security.BREAKS IN THE COLD WAR [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s73]In the aftermath of World War II, the banking elite returned to their originalplan of pitting the socialist East against the capitalist West. It was calledthe Cold War, and it was built on secrecy. Leaders on both sides, most unawareof the machinations in play, did not know the capabilities or the intentions oftheir adversary.The Cold War created an arms race between the superpowers of the United Statesand the Soviet Union. Naturally, banks prospered during this time, especiallyduring actual conflict, such as the “police action” known as the Korean War,which took place between 1950 and 1953 and cost almost thirty-four thousandAmerican and about four million Korean lives. Even here can be seen hiddenmanipulation from the top level of control. Never a declared war, the Koreanconflict was run by the United Nations, a supranational organization createdduring the distraction of world war in October 1944. The UN was merely areplacement for the old League of Nations, a failed attempt at world governmentinstigated by Woodrow Wilson and members of the Round Table secret society,which created the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921.American Korean War veterans would be flabbergasted to learn that the Russianswere running both sides of the conflict. During the war, the Soviets weresupplying the North Koreans with military hardware, technology, and advisers.Soviet military officers were largely in control of the war on the North Koreanside. Author Ralph Epperson cited a Pentagon press release that identified twoSoviet officers as being in charge of movements across the 38th parallel, theaction that precipitated the fighting. One officer, General Stefan Vasilev,actually was overheard giving the order to launch the attack against the south.General Vasilev’s chain of command reached from Korea to Moscow to the UNundersecretary general for political and Security Council affairs. At this sametime, Allied general Douglas MacArthur’s chain of command went through PresidentTruman and thence also to the UN undersecretary general for political andSecurity Council affairs, an office held at that time by Russian generalConstantine Zinchenko. This meant that the Soviet officers overseeing the NorthKorean war strategy were reporting to a fellow Soviet officer in the UN who wascoordinating the Allied war effort.But the money changers were not satisfied with the Cold War, even though the warin Vietnam made defense contractors billions while costing fifty-eight thousandAmerican and at least five million Southeast Asian lives. The bankers failed tofully profit from the Cold War due to the fact that historically Russia haddisdained the formation of a privately owned central bank. Neither the czars northe communists had allowed the private management of the Russian economy.This all changed with the collapse of communism, usually marked by thedestruction of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989. The end of the Cold War cameabout due to economic strains on the Russian economy, causing widespreaddiscontent, but also perhaps due to the loss of all secrecy, thanks to psychicremote viewing by both sides, as mentioned previously.On July 13, 1990, less than a year after the Berlin Wall fell, the internationalbankers were gratified by the creation of the Central Bank of the RussianFederation. Like the Federal Reserve System, this bank is an independent entitythat controls the Russian economy through the exclusive right to issue coins andbanknotes.With the economies of the two world superpowers now within their hands and withthe creation of the European Union, the money changers were able to concentrateon the last remaining major obstacle to their quest for one-worldcontrol—freedom within the United States.As far back as 1865, the international banking elite recognized the dangerrepresented by a free and prosperous United States. An editorial that year inThe Times of London, which, according to many, speaks for the Britishestablishment, warned, “If that mischievous financial policy which had itsorigin in the North American Republic [debt-free money] should become indurateddown to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost.It will pay off its debts and be without a debt. It will become prosperousbeyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. Thebrains and wealth of all countries will go to North America. That governmentmust be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.”Since the Times article was published, events in the United States havecertainly followed a course of destruction for individual freedom and liberty aswell as for the economy. And anyone who tried to obstruct this plan to destroythe economic strength and social cohesion of the American people was demoted,fired, blackmailed, ridiculed as a “conspiracy theorist” and “paranoid,” or as alast resort, especially if he or she held some important office or commanded apublic platform, simply eliminated.Intimidation in business was a last resort, the first being mergers and forcedconsolidation. Which is further intensified by interlocking directorships.MASTERS OF CONTROL [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s74]President John F. Kennedy, like Lincoln, attempted to curtail the bankers bydiminishing the power of the Federal Reserve. In June 1963, he issued $4.2billion in United States Notes through the U.S. Treasury rather than the FederalReserve System and also took steps to shift power away from the wealthycorporate elite. According to University of Pittsburgh professor Donald Gibsonin his well-researched 1994 book Battling Wall Street: The Kennedy Presidency,these steps included: tax proposals to redirect the foreign investments of U.S.companies, making distinctions in tax reform between productive andnonproductive investment, eliminating the tax privileges of U.S-based globalinvestment companies, cracking down on foreign tax havens, rejecting proposalsto eliminate tax privileges for the wealthy, proposing increased taxes for largeoil and mineral companies, and revising the investment tax credit.For such attempts to equalize the economy, Kennedy was killed in amilitary-style ambush while riding in a motorcade through Dallas in November1963 in circumstances still unsettled. Many conspiracy researchers do notbelieve it is sheer coincidence that Lincoln and Kennedy—the only two U.S.presidents to issue debt-free money—were both shot in the head in public.The assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther KingJr.—still unresolved in the minds of most of the public—along with the drugrevolution of the Sixties, with continuous escalation of the War on Drugs inreaction, heralded a continuing degradation of culture, civility, and commonsense in America. The Great Depression, two world wars, and subsequent“brushfire” wars in Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya havedepleted public self-confidence as well as the U.S. Treasury.James G. Watt, former interior secretary in the Reagan administration, saw themoney manipulation of insiders firsthand. “For years I had been irritated by‘right wingers’ who came to whisper about Council on Foreign Relationers and TheTrilateral Commission. … Now, after sitting in the cabinet room of the WhiteHouse in meeting after meeting listening to President Reagan’s advisors, I am ofa different opinion,” Watt related.“A most telling incident happened one morning in the spring of 1982. AsPresident Reagan sat down with us cabinet officers, he announced that Don Regan(then treasury secretary) would share an economic report and that David Stockman(then budget director) would have some comments to make. Secretary Regan led offthe cabinet meeting by reporting that several American banks were owed alarmingsums of money by some third world countries. So destitute were these nations, hesaid, that not even the interest on these loans could be paid back to the Bankof America, Chase Manhattan, Citibank, and others. Secretary Regan urged sendingtaxpayers’ dollars through the International Monetary Fund to these nations,enabling them to make interest payments to U.S. banks. … I asked if anyonebelieved these countries could ever pay back any of the principal. Silence! Didanyone believe these loans for the payment of interest would ever be paid back?When most of my colleagues just stared at the table, I pressed on. Then why, atour taxpayers’ expense, do we keep bailing out these countries? Annoyanceerupted around the table: ‘Jim, these American banks will be in jeopardy ifthose loans are in default by lack of interest payments.’ I countered, ‘Doesthat mean American bank customers would lose money?’ ‘No,’ they hotly responded,‘but investors might lose some dividends.’ Incredulous, I leaned back from thecabinet table and watched the president, seated only two chairs away. Absolutelynothing was going to stop those cabinet officers from bailing out a few powerfulU.S. banks. President Reagan was given no other option.“Was there a conspiracy by members of the trilats and CFR, first, to control theeconomies of other nations and now to ‘save their own hides’? No. I still don’tbelieve the liberals are capable of getting together to plan a conspiracy. Yet,that was the end result. How could it have happened? I believe there is aconspiracy of shared values, a commonality in the thoughts and objectives ofthese liberals. These internationalists don’t want to trust their economicfortunes to the free market. They want stronger government controls to securetheir economic fortunes and political clout. …”Watt still believed in the dichotomy of “liberal” versus “conservative” and didnot realize that the power behind such un-American decisions was not due simplyto “shared values” or “liberal ideals,” but rather to the power of theinternational money changers operating behind the scenes and who manage bothmajor parties.Another person who not only saw global financial manipulation but activelyparticipated in it was John Perkins, author of the New York Times best-sellerConfessions of an Economic Hit Man. In the book, Perkins describes theactivities of economic hit men as “highly-paid professionals who cheat countriesaround the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the WorldBank, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign‘aid’ organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of afew wealthy families who control the planet’s natural resources. Their toolsincluded fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion,sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken onnew and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization.”Perkins’s consulting firm sent him around the world. He said his job was “toenslave nations that had resources our corporations coveted by burdening themwith debts they could never repay. We then demanded that they sell thoseresources cheap, without social or environmental regulations, to ourcorporations. It was an incredibly successful strategy. In essence it createdthe world’s first truly global empire and the first one that was not builtprimarily through military occupations. It also transformed geo-politics. Thepower of elected officials was usurped by those who sit at the top of themultinational corporations (the ‘corporatocracy’).” Perkins said thecorporatocracy soon realized that similar strategies could be used in the UnitedStates to prevent the population from exercising democratic rights that mightthreaten its wars and other interests.“By 1980, the [corporatocracy] understood that its most effective weapon toprotect corporations against labor movements was debt. Borrowers were deceivedinto believing that they were paying low interest rates when in fact balloonpayments, adjustable rate mortgages, and other technically complex packagesresulted in higher overall rates that made it increasingly difficult to breakthe shackles of debt. This story continued. Regulations that protected ourrights were demolished. New wars erupted. Family businesses were wiped out bythe unfair practices of huge chains. The media was commandeered by a handful ofgiant conglomerates. Unemployment, poverty and foreclosures escalated. Theupward trend line of a growing and prospering middle class plummeted.”Perkins saw “a mutant, viral and extremely dangerous form of capitalism hasthrived under the ever-increasing powers of Wall St., Big Business, andgovernments that support them. … The global economic crisis is a symptom and amessenger. It has exposed our darkest secrets. The most materialistic andwealthiest nation in the history of the world, the U.S., also has the highestrates of suicide, drug abuse, murder, incarcerations, and other negative socialfactors. Our economy is based on fighting wars—killing people and ravaging theplanet—trading paper (mergers, derivatives, etc.), and selling each other thingsmost of us don’t need. Meanwhile our planet is drowning in pollution, people arestarving, our resources are dissipating, and our animals and plants aredisappearing at shocking rates.”Such forthright statements prompted vicious attacks from the corporate massmedia. Washington Post columnist Sebastian Mallaby described Perkins as “afrothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense,” while a NewYork Times writer referred to Perkins’s work as “cloak-and-dagger atmospherics.”Yet Perkins’s words echo those of Marine major general Smedley Butler, who inhis 1935 book War Is a Racket explained, “Bankers lend money to foreigncountries and when they cannot pay, the President sends Marines to get it.”Butler also explained that the racket of war is “something that is not what itseems to the majority of the people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows what itis about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of thevery many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.”But the money changers overextended themselves. Their ballooning economy beganto lose air in the meltdown of 2008. Many commentators have attributed thefinancial crisis and the Great Recession that followed to conscious planning bythe elite money changers of today with help by government hacks. After all, manymembers of Congress held investments with the Wall Street companies behind themortgage-backed securities fraud that broke in 2008.Internet commentator Michael Rivero called the collapse “the biggest financialswindle since the Great South Seas Bubble of 1721.” Rivero groused, “In shortthe US Government took your jobs, so the banks could take your homes, to coverthe losses from this gigantic swindle they were caught playing on the wholeworld. Tens of millions of Americans have had their homes confiscated to keepthe Wall Street crooks out of jail. It is wealth confiscation to protect thebanks, just like FDR did in 1933 with the gold, only this time done with housesand in such a way as to trick Americans into thinking it was their own faultthey lost their homes.”In the years before the crisis, Congress passed laws reducing governmentoversight and regulation, while banks were encouraged to make questionable loansand offer an $8,000 first-time home buyer credit in order to lure more buyers.Many bad mortgages were “bundled” with a few good ones to produce packagescalled derivatives. These were marked A-1 by rating agencies receiving bankmoney, then sold and resold to banks and other institutions. Then the whole scamcame unraveled. Sold on the canard that some banks are “too big to fail,”Congress voted to bail them out. This was nothing more than using public moneyborrowed from the Federal Reserve to cover the bad loans and credit swaps. Itwas a classic example of “taxation without representation,” as the vast majorityof the American public did not want to save the bankers from their own misdeeds.To add insult to injury, there have been no prosecutions of the Wall Streetinsiders or bank officials involved.Why was no one prosecuted? In mid-October 2008, the president of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, met with Andrew Cuomo, then the NewYork attorney general. Before he became the governor of New York, Cuomo waslooking into banking and rating irregularities and also looking intoquestionable bonuses during the bailout of the now-defunct AmericanInternational Group (AIG). According to persons with knowledge of the meeting,Geithner argued that he was concerned about the “fragility of the financialsystem” and requested that there be no prosecutions. Previously it had beenGeithner, acting as undersecretary of the treasury, along with Henry Paulson,who had sent $5 billion of U.S. taxpayer money through AIG to the giant Swissbank UBS. In defense of Cuomo’s inaction, William K. Black, a professor ofeconomics and law at the University of Missouri, wrote, “This is not some evilconspiracy of two guys sitting in a room saying we should let people createcrony capitalism and steal with impunity. But their policies have created anexceptional criminogenic environment. There were no criminal referrals from theregulators. No fraud working groups. No national task force. There has been noeffective punishment of the elites here.” Black should know. In the 1980s, heserved as the federal government’s director of litigation during thesavings-and-loan crisis. This lack of punishment stands in stark contrast tothat scandal, in which special government task forces referred one thousandcases to prosecutors, resulting in more than eight hundred bank officials goingto jail.President James A. Garfield, just two weeks before he was assassinated in 1881,stated, “Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute masterof all industry and commerce … and when you realize that the entire system isvery easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top,you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.”THE EXCHANGE STABILIZATION FUND [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s75]One of the hidden tools of financial control may come from the ExchangeStabilization Fund (ESF) of the United States Treasury. This little-known agencyis one of those government constructs that has morphed into a giganticmoney-moving operation with absolutely no oversight by the U.S. government, thestates, or the American people. Yet the ESF uses tax money and its profits tofund operations both inside and outside the country. Texas congressman Henry B.Gonzalez, a vocal opponent of the Fed, while chairman of the House BankingCommittee, criticized the ESF for “back-door financing” and “a complete lack ofpublic accountability.”The ESF was created and originally financed by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Itspurpose, according to an official description, was “to contribute to exchangerate stability and counter disorderly conditions in the foreign exchangemarket.” The act authorized the secretary of the treasury to exclusively deal ingold, foreign exchange, securities, and instruments of credit subject to theapproval of the president. While ownership of gold was outlawed for Americans in1933, the ESF transferred gold out of the country to foreigners in exchange fordollars, draining our gold reserves for years to come. Today, when people blamethe Federal Reserve for stealing America’s gold reserves, they should know thatit was actually the ESF, never scrutinized or questioned by Congress, thatdrained the Federal Reserve many years ago.Under agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 1978 Congressamended the Gold Reserve Act to provide short-term credit to foreign governmentsand monetary authorities. Such ESF “bridge loans” are financed through swaps,which means that dollars held by the ESF are made available to a country throughits central bank in exchange for the same value in that country’s currency.The ESF also administers special drawing rights (SDRs), assets created by theIMF and then loaned to countries requiring help in financing balance-of-paymentdeficits. SDRs are permanent resources of the ESF, whose operations areconducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed acts asan intermediary between the ESF and those foreign governments seeking short-termfinancing.This all sounds fine until one learns that it allows the U.S. Treasury secretaryto operate outside U.S. laws. According to minority members of the HouseCommittee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures who reviewed this law in itspreparation, “This [law] in fact, means that the Secretary of the Treasury shallbe under no obligation to comply with general laws of the United States in thehandling of this fund. … We believe that [this] places autocratic anddictatorial power in the hands of one man directly over the control of the valueof money and credit and indirectly over prices. … We believe that this is toogreat a power to place in the hands of any one man. We believe that it iscontrary to every true principle of American Government.”After serving as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, TimothyGeithner was appointed treasury secretary when Barack Obama took office. Afterbeing appointed by the president, a Senate panel must confirm the treasurysecretary. Much like a corporate president or CEO, the secretary is merely thetop administrative executive, who makes certain that things run smoothly. Thereal power comes from above. Sunset provisions in the 1934 law provided that theESF would expire after two years, but President Roosevelt extended its life bydeclaring that the economic emergency of the Great Depression was continuing.The ESF, like so many other government instrumentalities, is still with us.During World War II, the ESF was headed by Harry Dexter White, who was not onthe regular Treasury payroll but rather was paid from the ESF budget. He wasgiven vast authority in and full responsibility for all Treasury matters relatedto foreign relations as well as all Treasury economic and financial mattersrelated to U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and civilian-affairs operations anywhereoverseas. At the same time, White sat on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)Advisory Committee. The OSS was the counterespionage and counterpropagandaagency of the government, a large organization of more than twelve thousandpeople who created wartime propaganda and planted false rumors, including themanufacture and propagation of scandals, as well as other activities designed tosow confusion and distrust. All this was financed by the ESF.After the war, the ESF helped design the world’s new monetary system, includingits best-known creations—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WorldBank. The ESF also has been charged with providing unaccountable funds to theCIA. According to Lawrence Houston, the first general counsel of the CIA, “Theheart and soul of covert operations is … the provisions of un-vouchered funds,and the inviolability of such funds from outside inspection.”Now the ESF has copycat agencies in many states and itself has become nothingmore than a slush fund to bankroll CIA black operations. There are evenaccusations of laundering drug money. The slush funds operate withoutlegislative oversight or public scrutiny and, while technically legal, outsideof the intentions of the U. S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. To pinpoint themovement of tax money to questionable recipients would require a full audit ofall the economic stabilization funds and the legislation that regulatestransfers of public tax monies to innumerable clandestine and questionable,though technically “legalized,” funds.Internet commentator Eric deCarbonnel has documented an immense amount ofinformation on the ESF and has concluded that the agency “controls the New YorkFed, runs the CIA’s black budget, and is the architect of the world’s monetarysystem (IMF, World Bank, etc). ESF financing (through the OSS and then the CIA)built up the worldwide propaganda network which has so badly distorted historytoday (including erasing awareness of its existence from popular consciousness).It has been directly involved in virtually every major US fraud/scandal sinceits creation in 1934: the London gold pool, the Kennedy assassinations,Iran-Contra, CIA drug trafficking, HIV, and worse. …”It is inner connections like the ESF that lead to the creation of economic hitmen like John Perkins, who strong-arm and even oust the leaders of foreignnations. Because these covert agencies operate largely in secret and becausetheir corporate masters own the mass media, most Americans are unaware of thehigh crimes perpetrated in their name.Though the ESF began during the age of the Great Depression, the history ofconspiratorial banking control goes much further back. Mujahid Kamran, vicechancellor of the University of Punjab and an expert on corporate America, hasconcluded that the American banking system is ultimately pernicious. “The adventof the industrial revolution, the invention of a banking system based on usury,and scientific and technological advancements during the past three centurieshave had three major consequences,” he wrote in The Grand Deception: CorporateAmerica and Perpetual War. “These have made the incredible concentration ofwealth in a few hands possible, have led to the construction of increasinglydeadly weapons culminating in weapons of mass destruction, and have made itpossible to mold the minds of vast populations by application of scientifictechniques through the media and control of the educational system. Thewealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval thatthey cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and evenbeyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and forthem, most of mankind is garbage—‘human garbage.’ It is also their target todepopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what wehave now.” Dr. Kamran also noted that universities in developing countriesoperate in close partnership with the large private foundations and that theonly way to truly understand the operation of the world is “to realize the U.S.Government is owned by those who own these foundations.”"},{"pageContent":"PROOF OF THE PLOT [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#cha09]IF THE IDEA THAT A SMALL GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL YET interconnected individualscontrol the worlds of finance and commerce seems like a paranoid conspiracytheory, consider a 2011 study by three scientists at the Swiss Federal Instituteof Technology in Zurich. Combining mathematics used to model natural systemswith comprehensive corporate data, they traced the ownership of thetransnational corporations. From a database of 37 million companies andinvestors, the Swiss team constructed a model of which companies controlledothers through shareholding networks, coupled with each company’s operatingrevenues, to map the structure of economic power.The study shockingly confirmed the worst fears of conspiracy theorists and theOccupy protestors, as the analysis of the relationships among forty-threethousand transnational corporations identified a relatively small group ofcompanies—primarily banks—with disproportionate power over the global economy.One of the authors of the study, James B. Glattfelder of the Swiss FederalInstitute of Technology, hesitated to draw conclusions or support anyone’stheories, but he said, “Reality is so complex, we must move away from dogma,whether it’s conspiracy theories or free-market. Our analysis is reality-based.”According to an article in New Scientist, the studyrevealed a core of 1,318 companies with interlocking ownerships. Each of the1,318 had ties to two or more other companies, and on average they wereconnected to 20. What’s more, although they represented 20 per cent of globaloperating revenues, the 1,318 appeared to collectively own through their sharesthe majority of the world’s large blue chip and manufacturing firms—the “real”economy—representing a further 60 per cent of global revenues.When the team further untangled the web of ownership, it found much of ittracked back to a “super-entity” of 147 even more tightly knit companies—all oftheir ownership was held by other members of the super-entity—that controlled 40per cent of the total wealth in the network. … Most were financial institutions.The top 20 included Barclays Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and The Goldman SachsGroup.“In effect, less than one per cent of the companies were able to control 40 percent of the entire network,” explained Glattfelder.Although study members and commentators disparaged talk of conspiratorialcontrol, they did admit that such interconnectedness was worrisome, as it mightbring on instability in world markets. “If one [company] suffers distress, thispropagates,” said Glattfelder, who added that perhaps there should be globalantitrust rules to limit such centralized control. One suggestion offered was atax on corporations that display excessive interconnectivity.The Swiss researchers limited their study to corporations and never sought toanalyze the family, social, and business relationships among owners andstockholders. Yet personal relationships do matter, especially in matters ofbusiness and politics.One classic example of individuals guiding corporate decisions may be found inthe 1985 acquisition by Capital Cities Communications of the ABC televisionnetwork, a company about two thirds larger than the acquiring company. In late1984, William J. “Bill” Casey, then President Reagan’s CIA director, demandedthat the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoke ABC’s licenses becauseit had reported repeatedly on CIA scandals. The FCC was so unimpressed by therequest that it never asked the network to respond. But Casey’s demand promptedABC News president Roone Arledge to state, “The CIA’s complaint constitutes anunprecedented effort by a government agency to involve the power of governmentto suppress vigorous reporting about its activities. It raises serious anddisturbing First Amendment concerns.” Rebuffed by the FCC, Casey turned toCapital Cities, of which he was a founder. He owned 34,755 shares of thecompany, and his wife owned a comparable number, giving the pair a controllinginterest. Thus with the purchase of ABC, the head of the CIA took control of oneof the major TV networks with little reporting of this fact outside thefinancial pages of a few newspapers. The Cap Cities–ABC deal, the biggestbroadcasting merger in U.S. history, started an avalanche of media mergers andtakeovers. It also ended any deep investigative reporting on the CIA by ABC.As always, behind the flow of money necessary for such mergers and acquisitionswere the banks. Once there were hundreds of banks in America, owned byindividuals and local families. But due to government regulations put into placeduring the Reagan-Bush years, these banks either faded away or consolidated. In1990, there were thirty-seven major banks in the U.S. By 2009, buy-outs,mergers, and bankruptcies had reduced this number to four. Those left standingwere Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, according tothe General Accounting Office. Ominously, in June 2012, the giant global ratingagency Moody’s downgraded the ratings of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, citing concerns for the stability of the world’s financial system.Gerald Celente, founder of the Trends Research Institute and author ofbest-sellers Trend Tracking and Trends 2000, pointed out that even Jesus becamean activist when he confronted the money powers. “When you think about thePrince of Peace, when’s the only time he became violent? It was when he pickedup a whip and drove the moneychangers out of the temple. The moneychangers havetaken over the temples—the temples of Athens, the temples of Rome, the templesof Berlin and the City of London. They’ve taken over Washington. They’ve takenover every capital of every major city in the world. So where’s it going? It’svery simple to see where it’s going. It’s called class warfare.”Stephen Moore, senior economic writer for the Wall Street Journal editorialpage, said Americans have become a nation of takers, not makers. “Today inAmerica there are nearly twice as many people working for the government (22.5million in 2011) than in all of manufacturing (11.5 million). This is an almostexact reversal of the situation in 1960, when there were 15 million workers inmanufacturing and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the government. It getsworse. More Americans work for the government than work in construction,farming, fishing, forestry, manufacturing, mining, and utilities combined.”Big banks, big government, mortgage firms, ratings agencies, derivatives, creditswaps … they all sound too complicated for the average person. But are theyreally? Greed is still greed. Corruption is still corruption, and criminality isstill criminality, no matter the cover of law, regulations, corporate policy, orlegal technicalities.This was not all due to accident and coincidence. It was all the plan of ahandful of insiders, many operating within the secret societies, who provide adisproportionate number of government leaders and officials. Who’s behind itall? According to a growing number of conspiracy researchers looking to answerthat question, it can be traced back to thirteen families, all interconnected byblood.VOICES OF THE ELITE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s76]Various individuals have publicly claimed to be a part of the Illuminati, theinner elite, or whatever name one would like. While most are of dubiouscharacter with few or no real credentials, their stories tend to support theaccounts of various conspiracy researchers. Their stories are surprisinglyconsistent and offer fascinating insights into the workings of such an elite.Bill Ryan, who worked on a famous social sciences project called ProjectCamelot, interviewed one of these self-proclaimed elite members. “In the summerof 2010, I was approached by a very unusual man,” Ryan explained. “I’ve calledhim ‘Charles.’ He’s spent many years working for the elite group that considersit their responsibility to run the planet. He’s not an academic, a historian, ora scientist. But he wanted to communicate some important information about theworldview and philosophy of this group. Ryan reported,They are a controlling group of 33 individuals who meet frequently to makestrategic decisions about humanity and the planet. They are not the“Illuminati,” which is a lower-level secret society—of which there are many,like the Knights of Malta, the Rosicrucians, Skull and Bones, the Priory ofSion, numerous Masonic groups, and more. The 33 can be compared to a Board ofDirectors of a very large global corporation. Like a real Board, there is a“Number One Man” who makes final policy decisions, having consulted hiscolleagues, all of whom have expertise and who have earned a right toparticipate. There are differences of opinion sometimes—and differentpersonalities, as in any group of people—but basically they are very muchaligned with the overall purpose, which is (using this analogy) to ensure thatCorporation Plant Earth continues to expand and prosper. All in line with theCorporation’s “mission statement”—which is about optimizing the human genome.Charles explained that each of these people, each representating one ofthirty-three bloodlines, is so powerful and controls so much wealth and assetsthat each could be regarded almost as a nation-state in his (or occasionallyher) own right. They all regard it as their responsibility to “manage” planetEarth. He said they are party to a great deal of hidden history through theirprivate possession of ancient documents and artifacts, many located in theVatican Library.The history and lineage of the human race is not—at all—what the public has beentold. It has been decided a long time ago that the human race could not handlethese truths. This information is regarded as a kind of “sacred knowledge.”Safeguarding this knowledge is taken extremely seriously, and, as Charlesexplained, there is a great deal of tradition and historical culture—going backthousands of years—which is almost inextricably interwoven with the way thegroup functions. As Charles also tried to explain, they do not see time as youand I do. Delaying something by a year, or a decade, or a hundred years, meansvery little. They do not operate to a calendar. Only to unfolding events.One woman, who goes by the pseudonym of Svali, claimed to have escaped theIlluminati after working for years as a high-level programmer and trainer. Shesaid that while she was growing up, her mother and stepfather were Illuminatimembers. According to Svali, the Illuminati have six chairs on their “ascendedmasters council”—representing the sciences, government, leadership, scholarship,spiritual affairs, and military affairs—and she claimed that her mother sat on aWashington, D.C., area regional council and served as spiritual chair. A Germanphilosopher named Adam Weishaupt is often credited with founding the Illuminatiin 1776 in Germany, but Svali said that this was untrue. “They chose him as afigurehead and told him what to write about. The financiers, dating back to thebankers during the times of the Templar Knights who financed the early kings inEurope, created the Illuminati. Weishaupt was their ‘gofer,’ who did theirbidding,” she said. Svali explained:The Illuminati is a group that practices a form of faith known as“enlightenment.” It is Luciferian, and they teach their followers that theirroots go back to the ancient mystery religions of Babylon, Egypt, and Celticdruidism. They have taken what they consider the “best” of each, thefoundational practices, and joined them together into a strongly occultdiscipline. Many groups at the local level worship ancient deities such as “El,”“Baal,” and “Ashtarte,” as well as “Isis and Osiris” and “Set.” This said, theleadership councils at times scoff at the more “primitive” practices of theanarchical, or lower levels. I remember when I was on council in San Diego, theycalled the high priests and priestesses the “slicers and dicers,” who kept the“lower levels happy.” This is not to offend anyone, it only shows that at theleadership levels, they often believe they are more scientifically andcognitively driven. But they still practice the principles of enlightenment.There are 12 steps to this, also known as “the 12 steps of discipline,” and theyalso teach traveling astral planes, time travel, and other metaphysicalphenomena. Do people really do this, or is it a drug induced hallucination? Icannot judge. I saw things that I believe cannot be rationally explained when inthis group, things that frightened me, but I can only say that it could be acombination of cult mind control, drug inductions, hypnosis, and some truedemonic activity. How much of each, I cannot begin to guess. I do know thatthese people teach and practice evil.At the higher levels, the group is no longer people in robes chanting in frontof bonfires. Leadership councils have administrators who handle finances (andtrust me, this group makes money. That alone would keep it going even if therest were just religious hog wash). The leadership levels include businessmen,bankers, and local community leaders. They are intelligent, well educated, andactive in their churches. Above local leadership councils are the regionalcouncils, who give dictates to the groups below them, help form the policies andagendas for each region, and who interact with the local leadership councils.At the national level, there are extremely wealthy people who finance thesegoals and interact with the leaders of other countries. The Illuminati areinternational. Secret? By all means. The first thing a child learns from“family, or the Order” as they are called, is “The first rule of the Order issecrecy.” This is why you don’t hear from more survivors who get out. Thelengths that this group goes to, to terrify its members into not disclosing, isunbelievable. … Try being buried in a wooden box for a period of time (it mayhave been minutes, but to a four year old it is an eternity), and then when thelid is lifted, being told, “if you ever tell, we’ll put you back in forever.”The child will scream hysterically that they will NEVER EVER [emphasis in theoriginal] tell. I was that child, and now I am breaking that vow made underpsychological duress. Because I don’t want any other children to go through whatI did, or have seen done to others.The Illuminati are present in every major metropolitan center in the UnitedStates. They have divided the United States up into seven major regions, andeach has a regional council over it, with the heads of the local councilsreporting to them. They meet once every two months, and on special occasions. …They also have excellent lawyers who are well paid to help cover their tracks.There are also people in the media paid to help keep stories from coming out. Iknow of three people in San Diego who worked for the Union Tribune who werefaithful Illuminists, and who also wrote frequent articles attacking localtherapists who worked with RA [Ritual Abuse] survivors. I remember leadershipboasting they had “run so-and-so out of town” because of a media blitz, andbeing quite happy about it.The Illuminati believe in controlling an area through its banks and financialinstitutions (guess how many sit on banking boards? You’d be surprised). Localgovernment: guess how many get elected to local city councils? Law: children areencouraged to go to law school and medical school. Media: others are encouragedto go to journalism school, and members help fund local papers.Another proclaimed whistle-blower from within the elite entered theAboveTopSecret Forum in the fall of 2008 using the avatar Hidden Hand. Thisinsider described experiencing life within The Family, a group of elitistsaligned with extraterrestrials. They are alternately termed the Illuminati,Nephilim, Custodians, Watchers, and Advanced Beings, and they are the product ofdistinct bloodlines that have passed along wealth and power from one generationto another. “I am a generational member of a Ruling Bloodline Family,” HiddenHand proclaimed. “Our lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. From theearliest times of your recorded ‘history,’ and beyond, our Family has been‘directing’ the ‘play’ from behind the scenes, in one way or another. … Thereare 13 ‘base’ or ‘core’ original bloodlines. Yet there are many, many otherlines that spring from these, as do rivers from the oceans. If you imagine the13 original lines as primary colors, that can be mixed to create a vast array ofother colors, then you will have some comprehension. Again, no competition, justFamily.”Hidden Hand contradicted David Icke’s belief that this family was filled withreptilian creatures. “We are most certainly not Reptilian,” Hidden Hand stated.“And there is nothing remotely reptilian about the True Power Bloodlines.”Hidden Hand’s posts were compiled and presented by Michael E. Salla, who is thefounder of the Exopolitics Institute, which studies the politics of the impactof extraterrestrial life on humanity. In 2004, Salla was dismissed from hisposition with the Center for Global Peace in Washington’s American Universityfor his research on UFOs. Salla interpreted Hidden Hand as suggesting that thereis a “Luciferian group soul that is working in our Galaxy that has establishedpower not only on our planet, but on other worlds. Reptilian worlds under theinfluence of the Family, or Luciferian entity, would be as highly manipulated asour own by off-world bloodlines.“This appears uncannily similar to the Star Wars saga where a group of darkspiritual entities called the Sith secretly infiltrate and take over politicaland spiritual organizations in the Galaxy,” said Salla. “If the Hidden Hand andhis Luciferian peers belong to something similar to the Sith, is there apositive counterpart similar to the Jedi Knights? This is how the Hidden Handdescribes the modern equivalent of the Jedi Knights—a positive polarity‘Family.’ ”After Hidden Hand’s posts, the AboveTopSecret website was soon filled with criesof “Hoax!” and “disinformation.” But after studying the lengthy dialogs withHidden Hand, Salla concluded, “In my opinion, it is a genuine revelation by aninsider belonging to an organization called ‘The Family’ that has both Earthlyhuman and extraterrestrial membership. The Family has been secretly involved inruling both the Earth and other planets through highly placed elites in keysocial and political institutions.”PRESIDENTIAL BLUE BLOODS [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s77]Though times have changed since the ages of the Habsburgs and the Rothschilds,it appears that the person closest to the ancient bloodlines carries the day inUnited States national elections. It has been noted that in every election thecandidate with the most royal genes always wins.Mainstream news reports in 2000 quoted researchers at Burke’s Peerage whopredicted that George W. Bush would win the presidency over Al Gore because “thepresidential candidate with the most royal genes and chromosomes has, up to now,always won the White House.” They said that while both Bush and Gore wererelated to the elite families and of royal blood, the Bush family was moreclosely connected. “[Bush] is closely related to every European Monarch both onand off the throne,” said Burke’s publishing director, Harold Brooks-Baker. Henoted that both the Bush and Pierce families were members of high society goingback a thousand years at least. “Not one member of his [Bush’s] family wasworking class, middle class, or even middle, middle class,” he added.“You can’t just write off 200 years of accurate predictions,” statedBrooks-Baker, noting that Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, was theson of Greek immigrants who had no connections to any European throne, and helost in a landslide.David Icke, citing information from Burke’s Peerage, wrote, “Every presidentialelection in America, since and including George Washington in 1789 to BillClinton, has been won by the candidate with the most British and French royalgenes. Of the 42 presidents to Clinton, 33 have been related to two people:Alfred the Great, King of England, and Charlemagne, the most famous monarch ofFrance. So it goes on: 19 of them are related to England’s Edward III, who has2000 blood connections to Prince Charles. The same goes with the bankingfamilies in America. George Bush and Barbara Bush are from the samebloodline—the Pierce bloodline, which changed its name from Percy, when itcrossed the Atlantic. Percy is one of the aristocratic families of Britain, tothis day. They were involved in the Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament at thetime of Guy Fawkes.”If anyone should think that Barack Hussein Obama must be an exception to thesebloodline connections, that person would be wrong. According to Lynne Cheney,wife of Dick Cheney, Obama is an eighth cousin to the former vice president. Shediscovered this familial connection while researching her ancestry for a book.According to a Cheney spokesperson, Obama is a descendant of Mareen Duvall, aFrench Huguenot whose son married the granddaughter of a Richard Cheney, who hadarrived in Maryland in the late 1650s from England.Moreover, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that both Obama and Cheney are bloodrelations to the Bush family. According to the paper, George W. Bush and Obamaare tenth cousins once removed. They are linked through a seventeenth-centuryMassachusetts couple, Samuel Hinckley and Sarah Soole. Hinckley is a distantrelative of George Herbert Walker Bush’s friend John Warnock Hinckley Sr., whoseson, John Warnock Hinckley Jr., was the man accused of shooting President RonaldReagan in 1981. According to a Reuters news story in late 2011, presidentialcandidate Mitt Romney also is related to the Bush family.Gary Boyd Roberts, a former senior research scholar at the New England HistoricGenealogical Society, has traced George W. Bush’s family tree to sixteen U.S.presidents besides his father: George Washington, Millard Fillmore, FranklinPierce, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield,Grover Cleveland, Teddy Roosevelt, William H. Taft, Calvin Coolidge, HerbertHoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. Moreover, theBush family, according to several sources, is closely related to the king ofAlbania and has kinship with every member of the British royal family and theHouse of Windsor. They are related to twenty British dukes, and George W. Bushis a thirteenth cousin of Britain’s queen mother, and of her daughter, QueenElizabeth II. George W. is thirteenth cousin once removed from Prince Charlesand has direct descent from King Henry III, Charles II, and Edward I of England.According to Burke’s Peerage, even former president Bill Clinton is geneticallyrelated to the House of Windsor.Many are unaware that the Windsors, the royal family of England, originally wereknown by their German name, Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, a German dynasty, oftenshortened to Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The change to Windsor came during World War I,when England was at war with Germany and there was considerable anti-Germansentiment. To distance themselves from their German heritage, on July 17, 1917,Queen Victoria’s grandson King George V officially declared that all maledescendants of Queen Victoria would bear the name Windsor. The name Windsor camefrom a castle owned by the family. Six British monarchs, including QueenVictoria and King George III, who ruled during the American Revolution, weremembers of the German House of Hanover.In 1947, England’s Elizabeth II married Prince Philip, her third cousin, the sonof Alice of Battenburg and a member of the House ofSchleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. Philip was an offspring of Greek andDanish royal families, born in Greece. After serving in the Royal Navy afterWorld War II, Philip became a British citizen and adopted the name Mountbatten.With Elizabeth’s ascension to the throne in 1952, it was assumed she would takeher husband’s name, Mountbatten, but her family and Winston Churchill insistedshe retain the name Windsor. Through an Order in Council in 1960, the nameMountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth’s male-linedescendants.Phillip Eugene de Rothschild, a Rothschild descendant now living in America,explained to David Icke that the German Battenberg bloodline is joined with theBauer-Rothschild bloodline in a “Rothsburg dynasty” that traces its ancestryback to Aeneas. In Greek and Roman mythology, Aeneas was a Trojan soldier whowas said to be a human hybrid, son of the goddess Venus, as well as the fatherof Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome.The claim that both European and American rulers are related to the ancientbloodlines has been disputed. It has been said that nearly everyone can begenetically connected to everyone else. One genealogist calculated that as of2001 there were 657 living legitimate descendants of England’s King George IIIand 4,982 living descendants of George I. “There are probably more illegitimatedescendants than legitimate ones. George I is 11 generations from Prince William(via senior line). But Edward of Windsor is another 12 generations back fromGeorge I. He could have 20 million living descendants. And Charlemagne isanother 19 generations back from Edward. The majority of people in Europe andnorthern America are descended from him,” stated the unnamed genealogist inYahoo’s Answers section.The idea that any person can be genealogically linked to any other came intobeing with a university study indicating that any individual is only about sixsteps of acquaintance away from any person on Earth. Actor Kevin Bacon, who oncecommented that he had worked with everyone in Hollywood or someone who hadworked with everyone, even became the object of a trivia game entitled SixDegrees of Kevin Bacon, in which participants try to connect any person inHollywood to Bacon as quickly as possible. Of course, being genealogicallyconnected and being merely an acquaintance are two entirely separate things.While games and statistics seem to disparage the idea that certain bloodlineshave passed down knowledge, rule, and royalty throughout human history, manystill feel disquieted that so many world leaders, including U.S. presidents,have been connected to the royal bloodlines of Europe, people who trace theirline back to the dynasties of Egypt, Babylon, and Sumer. Apparently the sons anddaughters of miners, cooks, and laborers somehow are disqualified from highpublic office.According to several researchers, the ancient bloodlines of the Anunnaki spreadfrom Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, and even China to encompass the entire world. Whileconventional history has concentrated on the male descendants of thesebloodlines, through the centuries the bloodlines have also been passed throughthe mitochondrial DNA of the females. While the passing of the “true” bloodlineoften has been done by incest and intermarriage, practiced by most of history’srulers, an extended network of relations has been created through concubines,mistresses, slaves, and hired help, often by rape.A growing number of researchers and writers are building the case against ahandful of people who seem intent on creating a New World Order, one in whichelites rule through financial institutions so as to maintain their hereditaryprivileges instead of helping the world’s people develop individual worth,creativity, and productivity.According to David Icke, these bloodlines have been “the force behind many ofthe major Empires of history.” Since its inception, this force has spreadthroughout the world as an informal organization with members at the top ofcorporate and political hierarchies. Credo Muta, official historian of the Zulunation, has described how the colonial powers, after proclaiming independencefor African countries, continued their control by selecting African leaders whocame from the bloodlines of former kings and queens claiming to have descendedfrom ancient sky gods.Icke described how the chain of command works within this family network, termedby some the Illuminati, as follows:The Illuminati structure can be symbolized as a web or as a pyramid in which thefew at the top dictate to the many at the bottom. The many are kept in ignoranceof what is really going on. The pyramid structure of secret societies ismirrored in government, banking, business and every other organization andinstitution. … They are “compartmentalized” and the only people who know how itall fits together are the very few sitting at the top—the bloodline families andtheir lackeys.The smaller pyramids, like the local branch of a bank, fit into bigger andbigger pyramids, until eventually you have the pyramid that encompasses allof the banks. It is the same with the transnational corporations, politicalparties, secret societies, media empires, and the military. If you go highenough in this structure all the transnational corporations (like the oilcartel), major political parties, secret societies, media empires and themilitary (via NATO, for instance), are controlled by the same families who sitatop the biggest pyramids. … All roads lead eventually to them—everything fromthe food we eat; the water we drink; the “medical care” we receive, includingvaccines; the “news” we watch, hear and read; the “entertainment” we are given;the governments that dictate to us; the military that enforces the will of thegovernments; and the drug-running network aimed at destroying young people. Thesame families and their gofers control all these areas and much more.BAD FOOD AND WATER [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s78]If there is a ruling elite, the best way to keep its subjects under controlwould be through bad water and bad food that made people unhealthy, obese, anddepressed. One of the ways to make the water bad would be through the use offluoride, which, despite much positive publicity, is only used in public watersupplies by eleven nations.Concern over fluoride in the nation’s water supply was once derided asright-wing paranoia, but recently the public has become privy to studiessuggesting the dangers of fluoride toxicity. International author and medicalwriter Mary Sparrowdancer noted that, since the 1930s, German and Austrianscientists knew how to treat overactive thyroids by bathing a person influoride. This was effective because fluoride blocked thyroid function. “For theUS government, long partnered with the pharmaceutical industry, to then forcethis same treatment on a nation of people with healthy thyroids under the liethat fluoride ‘prevents cavities in children,’ is unconscionable. The NurembergCode of ethics pertaining to human experimentation labels it an act of crime,stating, ‘The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.’ Today, 70 percent of the US is being forced to receive this thyroid-blockingchemical via their water without consent or medical monitoring for overdose,allergic reaction or blocked thyroid function.”Symptoms of thyroid damage and fluoride poisoning include weight gain, edema,kidney disease, kidney failure, hair loss, depression, aggression, aches, pains,skin problems, bone deformities including arthritis, sexual/erectiledysfunction, memory loss, weakness, fatigue, heart disease, irritability,digestive disorders, and cancer. As the dangers of fluoride reach more of thepublic, an increasing number of cities and communities have abandoned thefluoridation of their water supply, a practice initiated in the past with littleor no debate. This is due to the fact that many of these cities didn’t even havea choice on fluoride in the first place. According to the former head of theHarvard School of Dental Medicine, James M. Dunning, “The big cities in theUnited States were mostly fluoridated by executive action in such a way as toavoid public referenda.”And fluoride might be in more than just our drinking water. A 2005 study at theWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found some commercial icedtea mixes contain up to 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride, which is wellabove the 4 ppm maximum allowed by the EPA in drinking water and the 2.4 ppmpermitted by the FDA in bottled water and beverages. Researcher Michael Whytesaid, “When fluoride gets into your bones, it stays there for years, and thereis no established treatment for skeletal fluorosis. No one knows if you canfully recover from it.” Yet fluoridation has been an agenda item of the elite’sgiant chemical corporations for many years.Who will ultimately control the state of the nation’s water supply apparentlywas decided by an executive order signed in March 2012 by President Obama. Undersection 201 (5), National Defense Resources Preparedness Order (NDRPO), thesecretary of defense will be in charge of water resources, which seems odd inthat under this order, the secretary of energy is in charge of energy and thesecretary of transportation in charge of transportation. But defense? Accordingto this NDRPO, virtually everything in the United States will come under thetotal control of the National Security Council and Homeland Security Council, inconjunction with the National Economic Council, all of which serve thepresident.One firm at the center of worldwide controversy over the use of both chemicalsand genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is Monsanto. As the world’s leadingchemical company (it partnered with the global Nazi chemical firm IG Farbenprior to Farben’s dissolution in 2003), Monsanto has been involved in severalscandals involving toxic chemicals. For forty years, it produced industrialcoolants known as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), which were dumped by themillions of pounds into open-pit landfills and rivers. These coolants are nowbanned. Monsanto also helped manufacture a number of harmful dioxins thatpollute the environment and can afflict humans who come into contact with them.The most famous of these was Agent Orange, a defoliant that caused many U.S.Vietnam War veterans, as well as several hundred thousand Vietnamese, to sufferdebilitating problems after the war, such as skin, nerve, and respiratorydisorders, cancer, birth defects in offspring, and many other problems.An investigation in the early 1990s by the EPA concluded that the chemical gianthad misrepresented data concerning the hazards of dioxins and Agent Orange,which led to the government denying compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed toAgent Orange and their children suffering birth defects.In 2011, despite widespread opposition in the light of studies indicatingharmful effects from genetically modified seeds and despite a Supreme Courtdecision banning the planting of such seeds pending environmental impact studiesby the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Obama and the USDAdecided to deregulate two of Monsanto’s GMO seed varieties—alfalfa and sugarbeets.To legitimize such action, in 2012 riders were attached to both the 2012 FederalAgriculture Reform and Risk Management Act, known simply as the Farm Bill (HR6083), and section 733 of the 2013 Agriculture Appropriations Bill (HR 5973)that would require the secretary of agriculture to “immediately” grant temporaryapproval or deregulation to GMO crops even if the crop’s safety is in questionor under legal review. “In other words, if this single line in the 90-pageAgricultural Appropriations bill slips through, it’s Independence Day for thebiotech industry,” warned Alexis Baden-Mayer and Ronnie Cummins on the AlterNetwebsite. They noted that under this provision, the “Monsanto rider,” all thatany farmer or biotech firm need to do is ask, and “the questionable crops couldbe released into the environment where they could potentially contaminateconventional or organic crops and, ultimately, the nation’s food supply.”To understand the purposes of such deregulation, one should look at who standsto gain from it. Anthony Gucciardi, writing on the Natural Society website,noted that Bill Gates, cofounder and chairman of Microsoft, was urging that GMOseeds be used to meet the world’s demand for food and that his Bill and MelindaGates Foundation had funded experiments with the seeds in five African nations.“Monsanto’s drought-resistant corn seeds were given to African farmers facingdrought conditions, replacing traditional and sustainable farming withMonsanto’s GMO crops,” reported Gucciardi.At a meeting of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) inearly 2012, Gates touted the use of GMO seeds and announced that his foundationwould provide $200 million in new grants to research new GMO corn. As of August2010, Bill Gates’s foundation had purchased five hundred thousand shares ofMonsanto stocks.Despite Gates’s endorsement, some studies suggest that GMO crops may create moreproblems than they solve. John Vidal, the environment editor of London’sGuardian, has written, “Genetic engineering has failed to increase the yield ofany food crop but has vastly increased the use of chemicals and the growth of‘superweeds,’ according to a report by 20 Indian, south-east Asian, African andLatin American food and conservation groups representing millions of people.”Even more disturbing, a recent study reported in Reproductive Toxicology, showedBt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxins engineered into genetically modified foodswere found in the blood of twenty-eight of thirty pregnant women tested and in80 percent of the tested women’s umbilical cords. In a nonpregnant group, traceswere found in the blood of 69 percent. It was believed that the toxins enteredthe human body as a result of eating meat, milk, and eggs from farm livestockfed GM corn. Pete Riley, director of GM Freeze, a consumer group opposed to GMOfarming, said, “This research is a major surprise as it shows that the Btproteins have survived the human digestive system and passed into the bloodsupply—something that regulators said could not happen.”Despite a lack of reporting in the corporate news media in America, the publicshould know that Monsanto’s plans for its GMO crops and seed, often referred toas Frankenfood, have been beaten back in more than two dozen nations. Accordingto a February 2012 item in European Biotechnology Science & Industry News, “Theexodus of plant biotechnology out of Europe seems to have accelerated. Justthree weeks ago, BASF Plant Science announced it would leave Europe as an R&Dlocation for developing its GM plants. But now, it looks like US-based Monsantois following the example of its German R&D partner and turning away from Europefor good. First, the company announced that it does not plan to sell itsgenetically modified maize MON810 in France despite the highest court recentlyoverturning a three-year ban on its sale. Now United Press Internationalreported that Monsanto is closing its wheat growing operation, based inCambridge, which employed 125 people, and selling off crop-breeding centers inFrance, Germany and the Czech Republic.” The article also mentioned that many inDenmark were opposed to European governments approving GM plants. Apparently theEuropean Union came to an agreement that companies seeking EU approval for a GMcrop would agree not to market the product in those countries that wish torestrict cultivation, in return for those countries not blocking EUauthorization to grow the crops elsewhere in Europe.The fact that GMO products are taking a beating in Europe was acknowledged byBASF Plant Science president and CEO Peter Eckes, who wrote, “Thesocio-political climate and the regulatory conditions do not give us anyindication that genetically modified plants can be successfully commercializedin Europe in the years to come.”This is not the case in America. Anthony Gucciardi reported that “The USDA hasallowed Monsanto to run rampant, modifying staple crops, food items, and evenmilk. Monsanto’s rBGH is a synthetic hormone created using moleculesand DNA sequences that are a result of molecular cloning, which has been linkedto breast and gastrointestinal cancer. In the United States, this synthetichormone is present in ¹/³ of all milk. Meanwhile, it is banned in 27 countriesaround the globe. Marketed under the name Posilac, Monsanto has since sold thebrand to a division of Eli Lilly and Company, Elanco Animal Health.”Apparently even some Monsanto employees are wary of the company’s products. Inearly 2012, according to Britain’s Independent, Sutcliffe Catering Group, whichcaters to a Monsanto plant in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, banned GMO soybeansand corn from its menu so that “you, the customer, can feel confident in thefood we serve.” Monsanto executives confirmed the notice, but company spokesmanTony Coombes said the reason for the GMO-free food was because the company“believes in choice.” This statement seemed ironic to many as Monsanto has forsome time fought to prevent the clear labeling of GMO foods and threatenedruinous litigation against those who would investigate the firm.Many researchers and scientists believe that Monsanto’s GMO crops may beresponsible for the die-off of bees, a critical pollinator in the environmentalfood chain. In addition to adding fluoride to our drinking water and allowingquestionable companies to produce food using unsafe chemicals, the U.S.government also allows thousands of questionable additives to be used in thefood supplies, such as aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG). During theReagan administration in the 1980s, Donald Rumsfeld pushed the sugar substituteaspartame through a recalcitrant Food and Drug Administration (FDA) even thoughstudies linked this chemical to various cancers. Aspartame, composed of 50percent phenylalanine, 40 percent aspartic acid, and 10 percent methanol (woodalcohol), has been banned from children’s food products by the European Union.In our bodies, methanol breaks down into formaldehyde, the main ingredient inembalming fluid, and formic acid. Aspartame is found in more than six thousandfood products in the United States and Canada today, especially in thecommercial sweeteners NutraSweet, Splenda, and Equal, but due to the controversyover its effects on the human body, the sugar substitute is being relabeled asAminoSweet.MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, a nonessential amino acid, and is usedas a flavor enhancer. According to former food-processing engineer and foodscientist Carol Hoernlein, mainstream media are now acting surprised that MSGhas been linked to obesity, even though scientists have for forty yearsroutinely used MSG or glutamate to induce obesity in lab animals. In the 1960s,John Olney found that MSG damaged cells of the hypothalamus in the brain andmade lab mice morbidly obese. MSG also is a cumulative excitotoxin, a compoundthat overstimulates the brain, leading to migraines and hyperactivity,especially in children.If it’s not bad enough that our food is filled with these chemicals, some arenow saying that substantial amounts of the poison arsenic can be found in fruitjuices. Dr. Mehmet Oz sparked this debate when he told TV viewers that testsshowed some samples of commercial apple juices contained total arsenic levelsexceeding 10 parts per billion (ppb), the legal limit for bottled and publicwater. Furthermore, an investigation of apple and grape juice by ConsumerReports showed that roughly 10 percent of juice samples, from five brands, hadtotal arsenic levels that exceeded federal drinking-water standards. Most ofthat arsenic was inorganic arsenic, a known carcinogen. One in four samplescontained levels of lead higher than the FDA’s bottled-water limit of 5 ppb. Aswith arsenic, no federal limit exists for lead in juice. The Consumer Reportsresearch revealed that inorganic arsenic has been detected at disturbing levelsin other foods and that a growing amount of scientific evidence suggests thatchronic exposure to arsenic and lead, even at levels below water standards, canresult in serious health problems. Special concern was given to children underage five, who research found drink juice in quantities exceeding pediatricians’recommendations. Joshua Hamilton, a toxicologist specializing in arsenicresearch, stated, “People sometimes say, ‘If arsenic exposure is so bad, whydon’t you see more people sick or dying from it?’ But the many diseases likelyto be increased by exposure even at relatively low levels are so common alreadythat its effects are overlooked simply because no one has looked carefully forthe connection.”Health advocate Mike Adams, on his popular website, pointed to a number ofproblems in our food. He noted that two thirds of all fresh chicken meat sold ingrocery stores today is contaminated with salmonella; diet soda is laced withaspartame; “natural” corn chips are made from genetically modified corn plantslinked to widespread infertility; processed meats are laced with cancer-causingsodium nitrite; and everything from soups to salad dressings is “enhanced” withMSG. Supporting his allegations with many studies and news reports, Adams alsopointed out that the high-fructose corn syrup used to sweeten sodas andthousands of other products causes diabetes and is often contaminated withmercury. He also noted that Chicken McNuggets are made with a chemical used insilly putty and the soy protein used in most protein bars is extracted using ahighly toxic explosive chemical called hexane. “The FDA says nothing about allthis,” he added. “Instead, the agency wants you to believe that the real dangerin the food supply is found exclusively in raw dairy products which contain noadditives or synthetic chemicals, by the way.” Those who attempt to deal infarm-fresh and organic food and milk now are finding themselves at the end ofgovernment guns as the number of armed arrests targeting real food continues torise, even including the pacifist Amish.Adams’s concern may be well placed: male sperm counts have been droppingthroughout the world for several years. A paper published in the InternetJournal of Urology stated, “There have been a number of studies over the past15–20 years which suggest that sperm counts in men are on the decline. Sincethese changes are recent and appear to have occurred internationally, it hasbeen presumed that they reflect adverse effects of environmental or lifestylefactors on the male rather than, for example, genetic changes in susceptibility.If the decrease in sperm counts were to continue at the rate that it is then ina few years we will witness widespread male infertility.”Two recent studies published in the journal Fertility and Sterility concludedthat men taking drugs, such as the anti-impotence drug Viagra, could be damagingtheir sperm and lowering their ability to conceive. Another study, published inan environmental journal, the Ends Report, point to chemicals like dioxin asculprits in lower male sperm count.If we’re not getting chemicals from our food and water, then there’s a goodchance we’re getting them from pills. Nearly half the population of the UnitedStates today is taking some kind of drug, according to studies—and we’re nottalking about illegal drugs. One recent analysis by the Los Angeles Times basedon government statistics showed that prescription-drug-induced deaths havebecome so prevalent that their average yearly total now exceeds the number ofdeaths caused by traffic accidents. This number does not include illegal drugoverdoses.Despite the ever rising cost of health care in America and despite the fact thatAmericans score better than most other nations in major measurements ofhealth—such as lower percentage of tobacco smokers, lower alcohol consumption,and lower cholesterol levels—health-care-induced fatalities are the thirdleading cause of death, just after heart disease and cancer. These deaths occurfrom unnecessary surgery, overmedication, and other mistakes in hospitals, andfrom adverse effects of prescription drugs.If one of our most prized institutions—medicine—is so great, how do we explainthe use of armed SWAT teams to force people to take its pharmaceuticals, ashappened to Maryanne Godboldo in 2011. Godboldo is a Michigan mother who wassurrounded in her home by armed police—with a tank outside!—after refusing toallow her thirteen-year-old daughter to be injected with Risperdal(risperidone), a controversial schizophrenia drug that had already caused severeadverse reactions in her daughter. Three courts finally ruled that her refusalwas legal and ordered her daughter returned to her after the girl had been takenby the state. Godboldo had joined a growing number of persons concerned over theincreasing number of inoculations, questionable therapies, and psychiatric drugsbeing forced on a gullible and ignorant population.Poisonous food and water? When such issues are linked with the publiclyexpressed support for population reduction by the wealthy elite, it would appearthat such activities are part of an agenda to reduce the human population.As far back as 1977, notable academics Paul R. Ehrlich, Anne Ehrlich, and JohnHoldren were advocating reducing the world’s population through unsavory means.In their book Ecoscience, these authors promote involuntary abortions andsterilization by infertility chemicals placed in food and drinking water to ridsociety of those they believed contributed to “social deterioration.” They alsoadvocated an armed international police force to enforce a “planetary regime”over a global economy and social activities.Holdren, in April 2009, then serving as director of the White House Office ofScience and Technology Policy and co-chair of the President’s Council ofAdvisors on Science and Technology, suggested spraying heavy metal “pollutants”into the upper atmosphere to retard perceived “global warming,” lending strongsupport to those researchers who claim that such a program, involving theglobally observed chemtrails, has already been under way for years. Barium oxideand aluminum oxide, both harmful to the human respiratory system, have beenidentified among other substances as composing the chemtrails.PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s79]Could all the above be a ploy to kill off “undesirables”? In years past, thepseudoscience of eugenics was used to excuse murderous depopulation schemes. Fewtoday realize that the theological and scientific basis for the Nazis’ eugenicsbeliefs originated in the United States, particularly in California, long beforethe Nazis came to power in Germany. By 1900, thirty states had laws providingfor the sterilization of mental patients and imbeciles. At least sixty thousandsuch “defectives” were legally sterilized.Soon after the Nazis rose to power in Germany, they adopted similar techniquesagainst those they considered unworthy of life. These programs and attitudeseventually led to the Holocaust. Edwin Black, author of War Against the Weak:Eugenics and America’s Campaign to Create a Master Race, described how theRockefeller Foundation helped create the German eugenics movement and evenfunded the program that included “research” by the infamous Josef Mengele beforehe became the “Angel of Death” at Auschwitz. “Eugenics would have been so muchbizarre parlor talk had it not been for extensive financing by corporatephilanthropies, specifically the Carnegie Institution, the RockefellerFoundation and the Harriman railroad fortune,” wrote Black. “They were all inleague with some of America’s most respected scientists hailing from suchprestigious universities as Stamford [sic], Yale, Harvard, and Princeton. Theseacademicians espoused race theory and race science, and then faked and twisteddata to serve eugenics’ racist aims.” Many of these same families and firmshelped finance Adolf Hitler and his rise to power.It seems clear that the leadership of the new world order wants a good portionof humanity dead. When Henry Kissinger was the secretary of state, he directedthe 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200, which surveyed the populationsof the world. This report, as well as the Global 2000 Report drafted during theJimmy Carter administration, and the royalty-supported Club of Rome study, allcall for population reduction. Thomas Ferguson, a former Latin American caseofficer for the State Department’s Office of Population Affairs, once stated,“There is a single theme behind all our work—we must reduce population levels.”In a 1981 interview, Maxwell Taylor, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff and a prominent member of the Council on Foreign Relations, advocatedpopulation reduction through limited wars, disease, and starvation. He blithelyconcluded, “I have already written off more than a billion people. These peopleare in places in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We can’t save them. Thepopulation crisis and the food-supply question dictate that we should not eventry. It’s a waste of time.”As if reading from Taylor’s script, England’s Prince Philip was quoted in Peoplemagazine as saying, “Human population growth is probably the single most seriouslong-term threat to survival. We’re in for a major disaster if it isn’tcurbed—not just for the natural world, but for the human world. The more peoplethere are, the more resources they’ll consume, the more pollution they’llcreate, the more fighting they will do. We have no option. If it isn’tcontrolled voluntarily, it will be controlled involuntarily by an increase indisease, starvation and war.” Years later, Philip showed that this was notsimply wishful thinking but a call to action, when he mused, “In the event thatI am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order tocontribute something to solve overpopulation.”Such views correspond to those expressed on the mysterious GeorgiaGuidestones—the authorship of which is unknown—located in Elbert County,Georgia. The very first admonition on these stones is “Maintain humanity under500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.”A POLICE STATE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s80]Because the public cannot be counted on to voluntarily give up its freedoms andprivacy, a complex and tangled set of laws must be put in place to regulatecitizens. A police state must be created to force compliance with ever extendingand sometimes overreaching laws.An effective police state requires constant and intense surveillance. Newvehicles are being equipped with in-car tracking devices like OnStar.Intersections, even in rural areas, are being equipped with traffic lights inplace of stop signs. While this change may seem like a public service, it isbeing funded by the new Department of Homeland Security, and many lights nowcome with cameras that include radio frequency identification (RFID) chipreaders and even facial identification software. Police, who once wore blueuniforms with patches bearing the motto TO SERVE AND PROTECT, now wear blackcombat suits and are increasingly becoming militarized. The trend toward amilitarized police force began many years ago, when President Richard Nixondeclared a “War on Drugs” in 1968. Then in 1981, President Ronald Reagan signedthe Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Act, allowing the military to givelocal, state, and federal police access to military bases, research, andequipment. By 1988, the National Guard was conducting drug raids on city streetsand using military helicopters to search for marijuana crops. In 1989, whenPresident George H. W. Bush assigned the Department of Defense a larger role inthe drug war, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney declared, “The detection andcountering of the production, trafficking and use of illegal drugs is a highpriority national security mission of the Department of Defense.” Such use ofthe military, which caused little criticism when linked to the Drug War,nevertheless began a movement in government to disregard the Posse ComitatusAct, a law passed in 1878 preventing the U.S. military from policing thecivilian population. The law was passed following the shameful experience withmartial law under Reconstruction.A 1994 law authorized the military to donate surplus equipment to local policeforces. Since that time, millions of pieces of equipment—from weapons andgrenade launchers to armored personnel carriers and helicopters—have been handedover for use against the civilian population. These actions flagrantly disregardthe Posse Comitatus Act. In the Huffington Post, Radley Balko noted that “theproblem with this mingling of domestic policing with military operations is thatthe two institutions have starkly different missions. The military’s job is toannihilate a foreign enemy. Cops are charged with keeping the peace, and withprotecting the constitutional rights of American citizens and residents. It’sdangerous to conflate the two.”Such arming of the police engendered a rise in Special Weapons and Tactics(SWAT) teams, whose forces more than doubled in the years between 1980 and 2000in cities with fifty thousand or more people. “In 2002,” Balko reported, “theseven police officers who serve the town of Jasper, Florida—which had all of2,000 people and hadn’t had a murder in more than a decade—were each given amilitary-grade M-16 machine gun from the Pentagon transfer program, leading oneFlorida paper to run the headline, ‘Three Stoplights, Seven M-16s.’ ”Recent legislation has only furthered this trend. “In the 10 years since theterror attacks of September 11, 2001, the government has claimed a number of newpolicing powers in the name of protecting the country from terrorism, often atthe expense of civil liberties,” Balko wrote. “But once claimed, those powersare overwhelmingly used in the war on drugs. Nowhere is this more clear than inthe continuing militarization of America’s police departments.” Balko noted thatdelayed-notice search warrants, commonly called “sneak-and-peek” warrants thatwere part of the PATRIOT Act passed strictly as antiterrorism legislation, havebeen used in a terror investigation only fifteen times between 2006 and 2009.Yet during that same time period, such warrants have been issued more thansixteen hundred times in drug investigations.Following the attacks of 9/11, the new Department of Homeland Security beganadding funding for more military equipment to police arsenals. On the websiteAntiWar.com, Stephan Salisbury and Nick Turse pointed out,So much money has gone into armoring and arming local law-enforcement since 9/11that the federal government could have rebuilt post-Katrina New Orleans fivetimes over and had enough money left in the kitty to provide job training andhousing for every one of the record 41,000-plus homeless people in New YorkCity. It could have added in the growing population of 15,000 homeless inPhiladelphia, my hometown, and still have had money to spare. Add disintegratingDetroit, Newark, and Camden to the list. Throw in some crumbling bridges androads, too.We all know that addressing acute social and economic issues here in thehomeland was the road not taken. Since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Securityalone has doled out somewhere between $30 billion and $40 billion in directgrants to state and local law enforcement, as well as other first responders. Atthe same time, defense contractors have proven endlessly inventive in adaptingsales pitches originally honed for the military on the battlefields of Iraq andAfghanistan to the desires of police on the streets of San Francisco and lowerManhattan.But instead of rebuilding America’s infrastructure, tax money has been spent onarmored vehicles, SWAT armor, machine guns, helicopters, tactical gear andequipment, and even surveillance drones like those used against enemies in theMiddle East. “We needed local police to play a legitimate, continuing role infurthering homeland security back in 2001,” explained former Seattle policechief Norm Stamper, now a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, a groupof police and criminal-justice professionals advocating drug regulation ratherthan prohibition. “After all, the 9/11 terrorist attacks took place on specificpolice beats in specific police precincts. Instead, we got a 10-year campaign ofincreasing militarization, constitution-abusing tactics, needless violence andheartache as the police used federal funds, equipment, and training to ramp upthe drug war. It’s just tragic.” Is it merely tragic or is this part of a planby the elite to corral citizens and keep them under control even if it meansusing battlefield technology to do it?In early 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was tasked to developregulations for the testing and licensing of drones, making it easier for policeagencies and private companies to put unmanned craft in the air. The FAApredicted that by 2020, there could be as many as thirty thousand drones in theair over America, some equipped with weapons, including wireless Tasers, andinfrared, RFID, and facial recognition scanners.Some drones are already in use. In late 2011, the sheriff’s office of MontgomeryCounty, north of Houston, announced that it was preparing to launch an unmannedShadowhawk helicopter, which could potentially carry weapons. The $300,000 dronecraft was acquired through a Department of Homeland Security grant. The craftwill carry a powerful camera and a heat-seeking device. Sheriff Tommy Gage saidthe unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could be used in hunting criminals runningfrom police as well as in drug investigations. Critics of drone technologywarned that, privacy issues aside, unmanned drones might prove a hazard to bothair traffic and the public on the ground. “We’re not going to use it to beinvading somebody’s privacy. It’ll be used for situations we have withcriminals,” assured Gage. In early 2012, critics’ worst fears were realized whenattendees of a private police-only test in Montgomery County witnessed the dronelose control and crash into the sheriff’s SWAT team’s armored vehicle, calledthe Bearcat.In 2007, Houston mayor Annise Parker canceled plans to use these drones afterthe public became aware that Houston Police had secretly tested one there. Therevelation of secret testing sparked a national debate over such measures andattracted the attention of civil libertarians concerned over issues of policesearches without a warrant, spying into backyards, and issuing routine traffictickets by surveillance from above.Two news stories in 2012 were more ominous. On June 11, a 25,600-pound NavyRQ-4A Global Hawk unmanned drone costing $176 million went out of control duringa routine training exercise and crashed into a tributary of the Nanticoke Rivernear Salisbury, Maryland. There were no reported injuries or property damage,but the accident intensified critics’ fears that a sky full of pilotless dronesmight represent a threat to the civilian population, as well as air traffic.An even stranger story came out of the University of Texas at Austin, where agroup of computer researchers, using $1,000 worth of computer parts, claimedthey could hack into a government drone. Challenged by officials of the HomelandSecurity Department to prove their claim, a team under Professor Todd Humphreysdid just that. By mimicking the drone’s control signal, they were able to takecontrol of the craft, much to the chagrin of the DHS officials. “Spoofing a GPS[Global Positioning System] receiver on a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] is justanother way of hijacking a plane,” explained Humphreys. His demonstration lentsignificant support to those who have theorized that such computer takeoverswere employed in the hijacking of the four airliners on September 11, 2001.Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for theFederation of American Scientists, said, “There are serious policy questions onthe horizon about privacy and surveillance, by both government agencies andcommercial entities. … It’s not all about surveillance.”One would think with all this new high-tech, potentially lethal gadgetry forsurveillance and control, local police forces would be hiring the mostintelligent people available. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the case.In 2000, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld the city’srejection of forty-nine-year-old Robert Jordan after he applied to be a policeofficer in New London, Connecticut. Jordan’s application was rejected because hescored too high on an intelligence test. He sued the city, allegingdiscrimination and claiming that he doesn’t have any more control over his basicintelligence than over his eye color, gender, or any other inherent attributes.The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22, the equivalent ofan IQ of 104, or just a little above average. New London police said theyaccepted only candidates who scored 20 to 27, on the theory that those whoscored too high could get bored with police work and might soon leave the forceafter costly training. However, some believed that the lower IQ criterion wasmore about employing officers who would not question unconstitutional orders orpolicies than about losing the cost of training. Both the original court and theappeals court rejected Jordan’s claim, stating that there was no discrimination,because the same standards were applied to everyone who took the test.BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s81]Long gone are the days of government agents snapping alligator clips to asuspect’s phone lines. Today everything is electronics. Besides monitoring ourdaily activity outside the house, the government is monitoring what we say overphones, cell phones, and even online. According to the Associated Press, the CIAdaily monitors more than five million tweets and Facebook messages from theagency’s Open Source Center, located in a nondescript Virginia industrial park.Within the center, a team of several hundred linguists and analysts, many withlibrary science degrees and thus called “vengeful librarians,” pore overFacebook posts, newspapers, TV news channels, local radio stations, and Internetchat rooms around the world. Center director Doug Naquin said the group operateslike the computer hacker heroine of the popular crime novel The Girl with theDragon Tattoo, as they know “how to find stuff other people don’t know exists.”Not only is the government listening to what we say; it’s also storing ourcommunications as well. Although some have accused Facebook of being aCIA-backed operation, they have failed to notice that the National SecurityAgency (NSA) is three times larger than the CIA and has been constructing a $2billion compound in the desert of Utah one third larger than the U.S. Capitol tostore all forms of communication among citizens—a yottabyte’s worth.A yottabyte? You might already be familiar with gigabytes, the most commonlyused unit for computer hard disk storage space. A thousand gigabytes equal aterabyte. A thousand terabytes equal a petabyte. A thousand petabytes equal anexabyte. A thousand exabytes equal a zettabyte, and a thousand zettabytes equala yottabyte. In other words, a yottabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000 (onequadrillion) gigabytes. The average household computer holds about 200gigabytes.Devin Coldewey, writing on the computer site TechCrunch.com, asked,What are they storing that, by some estimates, is going to take up thousands oftimes more space than all the world’s known computers combined? Don’t thinkthey’re going to say; they didn’t grow to their current level of shadowyomniscience by disclosing things like that to the public. However, speculationisn’t too hard on this topic. Now more than ever, surveillance is a data game.What with millions of phones being tapped and all data duplicated, constantrecording of all radio traffic, 24-hour high definition video surveillance bysatellite, there’s terabytes at least of data coming in every day. And who knowswhen you’ll have to sift through August 2007’s overhead footage of Baghdad forheat signatures in order to confirm some other intelligence? Storage capacity ofthis magnitude implies a truly unprecedented amount of subjects for monitoring.James Bamford, author of The Puzzle Palace, an exposé of the NSA, has noted,Unlike the British government, which, to its great credit, allowed public debateon the idea of a central data bank, the NSA obtained the full cooperation ofmuch of the American telecom industry in utmost secrecy after September 11[2001]. For example, the agency built secret rooms in AT&T’s major switchingfacilities where duplicate copies of all data are diverted, screened for keynames and words by computers, and then transmitted on to the agency foranalysis. Thus, these new centers in Utah, Texas, and possibly elsewhere willlikely become the centralized repositories for the data intercepted by the NSAin America’s version of the “big brother database” rejected by the British.MEDIA CONTROL [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s82]Even with ubiquitous surveillance, there could be no real control of populationswithout top-down media control. After all, we define our democracy as rule bythe majority, and the majority is manipulated by the corporate mass media, whichby 2012 had devolved down to a mere five predominant international corporations.At a Bilderberg meeting held in 1991 at Baden-Baden, Germany, David Rockefellerreportedly summed up the cozy relationship between the wealthy elite and thecorporate news media when he told participants, “We are grateful to theWashington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, and other great publicationswhose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises ofdiscretion for almost forty years. … It would have been impossible for us todevelop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights ofpublicity during these years. But, the world is more sophisticated and preparedto march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of anintellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in the past centuries.”The control of these elites over the mass media has led to a degradation of ournation’s news. Many stories of great importance to a free society are dropped orlost among trivial accounts of sports figures, celebrities, and inconsequentialpolitical blathering.For example, with air, water, and food pollution causing an unprecedented risein cancer rates and considering the billions of dollars that have been thrown atfinding a cure, one would think that the media would have given more attentionto new cancer treatments being developed. However, when one prodigious younggirl possibly discovered an amazing cure, her work was only covered briefly byCBS News in early 2012.Seventeen-year-old Angela Zhang, the daughter of Chinese immigrants living inCupertino, California, received a check for $100,000 after winning the nationalSiemens science contest for her research paper detailing no less than a cure forcancer. As a high school freshman, Zhang began reading doctorate-level papers onbioengineering. In her sophomore year, she talked her way into a StanfordUniversity laboratory and was conducting her own research. Her concept was tomix cancer medicine in a polymer that would attach to nanoparticles. Thenanoparticles then would attach to cancer cells and show up in magneticresonance imaging (MRI). Doctors could see exactly where the tumors werelocated. Zhang then determined that an infrared light aimed at the tumors wouldmelt the polymer and release the medicine, killing the cancer cells whileleaving healthy cells completely unharmed.CBS reporter Steve Hartman noted, “It’ll take years to know if it works inhumans—but in mice—the tumors almost completely disappeared.” Some questionedwhy this technique, which appears to successfully cure cancers, would take yearsto develop for humans when there is already so much money in cancer research.Others wondered if this hopeful story would even get repeated incorporate-controlled media addicted to pharmaceutical advertising.There are also concerns over what’s not in the news. Censorship works as well byomission as by commission. Many people are concerned over the fact that so manywebsites and pages of information on the Internet seem to disappear at anincreasing rate, creating a nightmare for journalists and researchers, whosuddenly find their sources changed or missing.Is it simply irresponsibility, or is there method in the madness of corporatemedia control? Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a nonprofit mediawatchdog group, reported that media corporations share board members withdirectors of a variety of other large corporations, including banks, investmentcompanies, oil companies, health-care and pharmaceutical companies, andtechnology companies. The FAIR list showed interlocking board members in majormedia interests, including ABC/Disney, NBC/GE, CBS/Viacom, CNN/Time Warner,Fox/News Corporation, New York Times Co., Washington Post/Newsweek, Wall StreetJournal/Dow Jones, Tribune Co., Gannett, and Knight-Ridder.FAIR’s findings were supported by a 2005 study by Project Censored, anorganization that examines news to find out what is left out of the nationalconversation because of political, economic, or legal pressure. The studydetermined that within ten large media corporations, there were 118 individualswho sat on 288 different national and international corporate boards. ProjectCensored reported a revolving-door relationship between big media and U.S.government agencies, as well as a close ongoing interlock between big media andcorporate America. “We found media directors who also were former Senators orRepresentatives in the House such as Sam Nunn (Disney) and William Cohen(Viacom). Board members served at the FCC such as William Kennard (New YorkTimes) and Dennis FitzSimmons (Tribune Company).”The power of these media companies flows upward to the handful of globalists whoown the banks that facilitate the corporate finances. Considering that thesemedia organizations serve as the main sources of information for most Americans,corporate connections like the ones listed should require close and continuouspublic scrutiny for evidence of bias.“Disney owns ABC, so we wonder how the board of Disney reacts to negative newsabout their board of director friends such as Halliburton or Boeing. We seeboard members with connections to Ford, Kraft, and Kimberly-Clark who employtens of thousands of Americans. Is it possible that the US workforce receivesonly the corporate news private companies want them to hear?” asked the ProjectCensored research team. “If these companies control the media, they control thedissemination of news turning the First Amendment on its head by protectingcorporate interests over people.”The national news media are not only linked by directorships to corporatebusiness but also to higher education. The Project Censored team also foundoverlap between the boards of major media companies and prestigious U.S.universities. For instance, there was overlap between the Washington Post andthe University of Southern California and New York University, between Gannettand Columbia University, between Disney and Georgetown University, and betweenKnight-Ridder and Wharton, the business school of the University ofPennsylvania. In the report, Project Censored team members Bridget Thornton,Brit Walters, and Lori Rouse wrote, “With the decreasing state and federalfunding to universities, will we see our higher learning institutions tiethemselves more to corporations than the government for their funding? … Willthe universities eventually focus education around the production of workers orthinkers?”The team also noted how history was repeating itself with media corporations.“As the Roman Empire declined, feudalism took the place of the government. Thefeudal lord was one of the few sources of jobs in the fourth and fifthcenturies. These lords owned most of the land and resources. Today, we replacefeudalism with corporatism. The mass population has few choices for their news,information and education. As corporate media applauds an ownership society, wemust realize who gets to own. In corporate-dominated capitalism, wealthconcentration is the goal and the corporate media are the cheerleaders.”While information on the control of news is readily available from publicsources, it is never repeatedly and plainly presented to the millions ofaffected Americans by the corporate-controlled mass media. Mike Adams, on hiswidely read NaturalNews.com site, summed up the feelings of many when he wrote,“Much of the mainstream news is now utterly and completely fabricated these days… it’s all so utterly false and unbelievable that an intelligent person watchingthe news can’t help but explode with laughter … the information sources reliedupon by the masses are unable to report the truth anymore and must resort toweaving politically expedient fictions on everything from health care andmedicine to the fate of the U.S. dollar itself.”MORE EFFICIENT SERVITUDE [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s83]Some believe that a great deal of the control over our society comes from anorganization called the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. Originally theTavistock Clinic, established in Sussex, England, in 1921 by royal command, ithad been a research center for the British Special Intelligence Services (SIS).The clinic’s founder, Brigadier General John Rawlings Reese, had been working ondevising ways to manipulate political campaigns and public perceptions. In 1947,key members of the clinic formed the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations,which was funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. In 2006, theInstitute merged with the Portman Clinic, a psychotherapy services clinic inLondon, to become the Tavistock and Portman National Health Service FoundationTrust.In a book on the institute, John Coleman noted that it took shape prior to WorldWar I for wartime public relations. Tavistock’s leadership was given to twobrothers—the Harmsworth brothers—who were also known as Lord Rothermere and LordNorthcliffe. “Tavistock began as a propaganda creating and disseminatingorganization centered at Wellington House, where the original organization wasput together, with the intent of shaping a propaganda center that would breakdown the stiff public resistance being encountered to the looming war betweenBritain and Germany.” Coleman added,Funding was provided by the British royal family, and later by the Rothschildsto whom Lord Northcliffe was related through marriage. Arnold Toynbee was laterselected as Director of Future Studies at the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs (RIIA). Two Americans, [journalist and media commentator] WalterLippmann and Edward Bernays [“the father of public relations”], were appointedto handle the manipulation of British and American public opinion in preparationfor the entry of the United States into World War I and to brief and directPresident Woodrow Wilson, while Toynbee concentrated on changing British publicopinion.When John Rawlings Reese came in later on, he took the original mission of theorganization one step further. Reese wanted to control political campaigns anddevelop certain types of public mind-control techniques. According to Coleman,“It was Reese who launched the method of controlling political campaigns, aswell as mind control techniques, which continue to this very day, and it wasReese and Tavistock who taught the USSR, North Vietnam, China and Vietnam how toapply his techniques—all they ever wanted to know about how to brainwashindividuals or a mass people,” wrote Coleman.Researchers at Tavistock found that the same psychotherapy techniques used tocure a mentally ill person could be reversed and used against a normal one.Coleman stated, “The modus operandi developed by Reese and his gurus oftampering with minds proved highly effective, and is still in wide use inAmerica today. … We are tampered with, our opinions manufactured for us, allwithout our permission. What was the purpose of these behavior modifications? Itwas to bring about forced changes to our way of life, without our agreement andwithout even being aware of what was taking place.”Coleman said that Tavistock’s tactics have been adopted by many organizations,from the global think tank the Club of Rome, the United Nations, the RockefellerFoundation, and the Council on Foreign Relations to such disparate entities asMicrosoft, Citibank, the New York Stock Exchange, the World Bank, theInternational Monetary Fund, and many others. “This is by no means a completelist of institutions in the hands of Tavistock planners,” he added.Today, major corporations and ultrawealthy individuals fund organizations suchas Tavistock. They utilize these organizations’ secrets in the mass media topush just the right emotional buttons on social and cultural issues in order tomanipulate both working-class and middle-class people into voting against theirown economic interests. Edward Bernays, one of the pioneers of public relationsand advertising, was named one of the hundred most influential Americans of thetwentieth century by Life magazine and continued to serve as a governmentconsultant through the Bush I administration. As far back as 1928, in his bookPropaganda, Bernays wrote about the control of citizens in a democratic society,stating,The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinionsof the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those whomanipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible governmentwhich is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds aremolded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have neverheard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society isorganized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if theyare to live together as a smoothly functioning society. … In almost every act ofour daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our socialconduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small numberof persons … who understand the mental processes and social patterns of themasses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harnessold social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.Such mind manipulation in the past was accomplished though conventionalpsychological methods combined with subliminal programming, thought by many tohave been outlawed years ago. But the old techniques may seem mild compared to anew technology the Pentagon calls silent sound spread spectrum (SSSS), whichdelivers subliminal programming directly to the human brain via the auditorysense at frequencies imperceptible by humans. It is rumored that SSSS technologywas used in the First Gulf War, causing thousands of battle-hardened Iraqisoldiers to surrender without a fight. “Why would eight-year veterans of MiddleEastern warfare (with Iran 1980–1988) behave this way? Simple. They weresubjected to a technology that was so extreme and incomprehensible that theywere suddenly reduced to the level of compliant children and felt grateful tostill be alive in the wake of their mind-wrenching experience,” stated A. TrueOtt, a Peabody Award–winning radio commentator and author.Ott warned, “This technology is about to be used, albeit in a more subtlefashion, against American citizens in a highly classified and covert operationto mind control and manipulate the entire population into ‘compliance’ with ourNew World order overlords [emphasis in the original]. The technology willutilize a combination of HAARP [High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program]transmitters, GWEN [Ground Wave Emergency Network] towers, microwave cell-phonetowers, and the soon-to-be-mandatory High Definition Digital TV that will enteryour home via: a) cable, b) satellite, c) HD TVs, or d) thoseoh-so-easy-to-obtain ‘digital converter boxes’ that the government is so anxiousto help you obtain and underwrite most of the cost on your behalf.” Because ofsurreptitious programming broadcast at high or low frequencies outside the rangeof conscious perception, parents should no longer feel secure by simplymonitoring the content of TV programming or video games. All content aside, thetelevision has become a dangerous mind-control device.Why the need for such control? The would-be masters of the world desire anundisciplined public, ignorant of the basic principles of individual liberty.They wish to keep them confused, disorganized, and absorbed with unimportant ordistracting issues. They wish to discourage critical thinking and technicalcreativity by means of low-quality public education in mathematics, logic,systems design, economics, and even the humanities while providing unrelentingemotional trauma through stories of self-indulgence, exploitive sex, andgratuitious violence in the corporate mass media. Such distractions lead thepublic away from serious consideration of their personal needs toinconsequential outside priorities.More important, rewriting law and history changes the entire fabric of asociety. Tavistock programming has been masterful with these techniques, as wellas with the use of the Hegelian dialectic, or problem, reaction, solution. Thismethod basically involves fabricating or intensify a problem, offering adraconian solution, then settling for a “compromise” that nevertheless furthersthe intended goal.Many are now seeing the centralization of such public control. Catherine AustinFitts, who served as assistant secretary of housing and federal housingcommissioner under George H. W. Bush, believes that technology concentratespower in fewer and fewer hands. In a 2011 interview, Fitts said that this powercan “end up being extremely destructive of individual rights, extremelydestructive of the environment, extremely destructive of all the things thatcreate a healthy economy.”Fitts illustrated her point with a metaphoric character she called Mr. Global.“Mr. Global essentially thinks he’s in charge of governing planet earth,” sheexplained. “I think what Mr. Global would say is that you can’t trust theaverage person to make intelligent decisions, that popular opinion will neverturn the aircraft carrier in time, that democracy was a great experiment but itdoesn’t work because the average person can’t see or relate to the whole andcan’t make critical decisions soon enough to turn the aircraft carrier, and soyou have to do things like 9/11 to build the kind of consensus and globalpicture you need to act.”She also pointed to the growing distrust and disrespect between the citizenryand the developed world’s leadership. This cycle of antipathy, she stated, is apart of centralization, “because centralization ultimately makes the bodypolitic stupid, and so you need more and more tyranny to force things—and that’swhat we’re really watching globally as very invasive technology makes now thekind of tyranny that Orwell once wrote about in fiction very plausible. That iswhat we see happening.”TO WHAT END? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s84]What is the goal of the wealthy elite?The agenda may have been revealed by Nick Rockefeller, a participant in theWorld Economic Forum and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies. According to Hollywood producerAaron Russo, Rockefeller told him, “The end goal is to get everybody chipped, tocontrol the whole society, to have the bankers and the elite people control theworld.”It should be clear by now that the elite want to control the world, but thebigger question is why? Author Joseph P. Farrell wrote that while a final answeris not known to the uninitiated, one answer does suggest itself. “They areindeed trying to reconstruct a lost mythical past: a global ‘golden age’ with asupremely sophisticated science with which they can dominate and subjugate theEarth.” But he added, “To reconstruct it, on the scale required and implied bytheir enterprise itself, will require that virtually the entire planet and itsresources must be at their disposal.”Thoughtful persons outside the influence of the corporate mass media of Americasee more clearly the concentration of money and power for the aims of the rulingfamilies. In early 2012, Mujahid Kamran of Punjab University wrote in theNation,The term New World Order (NWO) was first used, and actual plans laid out forachieving this goal over the next few centuries, in the year 1773, at a meetingof the 13 richest men of Prussia held in Frankfurt by the 33-year-old bankerMayer Amschel Rothschild. … Rothschild turned to a manuscript during the meetingand read his points, which outlined a plan of action for taking control of theentire globe … he emphasized: “The qualification for this aristocracy is‘wealth,’ which is dependent on us.” He laid down: “Candidates in public officeshould be servile and obedient to our commands, so that they may readily beused.” He also laid down that their “combined wealth would control all outletsof public information.” And finally came the most inhuman axiom of their policy:“Panics and financial depressions would ultimately result in world government, anew order of one world government.” Modern day USA illustrates all thesefeatures with chilling clarity to anyone who cares to read the relevantliterature.Kamran said that the banking families have continued their relentless pursuit ofthe NWO and that hundreds of millions of deaths in maneuvered wars and conflicts“have not led to an iota of remorse in their hearts, minds and souls. … Like aparasite these families settle themselves or their agents in a healthy host, andhaving nourished themselves destroy the host. Germany was their host and now theUS is their host.” According to Kamran,The think-tanks that present to the public the goal of global occupation andcontrol by the international bankers in palatable terms include academics whoare on their payroll and, among other things, formulate doctrines to give an airof respectability to the program of conquering and controlling mankind likeslaves. In 1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski, founding member of the TrilateralCommission and member [of the] Council on Foreign Relations … in his book, TheGrand Chessboard … stated that in order to rule the world the US must occupyCentral Asia. This reveals the continuity of goal, design and effort of theelite—its agents have maintained the same language over a 100-year period. Theachievement of this goal will require a major war, a world war, starting mostlikely from the impending US-Israel attack on Iran. But to wage this war the USmust be transformed into a genuine dictatorship. Legislation carried out in thewake of [the] Oklahoma bombing and 9/11 has ensured that the US public lives inconstant fear of being arrested.Kamran pointed to three recent laws laying the groundwork for a virtual policestate. One is the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, signed by Bush in 2007,which allows the use of the military against civilians without permission of thegovernor of a state. The second is the National Defense Authorization Act(NDAA), signed by Obama in late 2011, which does away with habeas corpus byallowing the president to detain indefinitely anyone suspected of terrorism—noproof required and no appeal permitted. Third, on March 8, 2012, Obama signedinto law the Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011which criminalized protest. A response to the Occupy movement, this law providesfor fines and imprisonment of up to ten years for anyone engaging in“disruptive” conduct near “restricted” areas.“Taken together, the three laws indicate that the elite is well prepared toquell any civil unrest ruthlessly. The destruction of the middle class is alsobeing pursued so that it is rendered homeless and hungry and its ability toprotest destroyed. All this is part of the final push towards the NWO through agreat war,” wrote Kamran.Kamran is not the only one to see an encroaching police state. Internetcommentator Mac Slavo, after noting that gang-related crime in the major citiesis on the rise while police personnel and social programs are declining, wrote,“As more cities cut services and hundreds of thousands continue to lose theirjobs, the situation across the entire nation will become untenable. Socialsafety nets will fall apart and crime will become more violent and random as anew paradigm takes hold. Local law enforcement will be unable to control itusing traditional policing. The people will not only accept assistance from thefederal government in the form of tanks and soldiers on the streets of theirneighborhoods—they’ll demand it. Lucky for them—all of the executive orders fordeclaring a state of emergency are already in place and ready forimplementation.”Led by the United States, the world’s economy is tottering on the brink ofcollapse. A food and water shortage looms on the horizon. The Mediterranean Seaand the Gulf of Mexico are becoming bodies of dead water due to human misuse. Atthe time of this writing, deadly radiation continues to spew worldwide fromdamaged nuclear plants in Japan, with no end in sight. The world’s wealth flowsconstantly into fewer and fewer hands as the so-called industrialized nationswitness strikes, growing unemployment, and widespread social disorder.Governments, desperate to maintain the old social order, are cracking down oncivil liberties and freedom.The track record of world leaders today is shameful. They no longer listen totheir populations but rather to their corporate backers. Corporate leaders,mindful of their precarious position beneath the real controllers, no longerseem to care for anything past their profit line. Their decisions are not aboutwhat’s good for the public, the environment, or even any humane concept ofmorality.When corporate leaders and their hired politicians speak of the “greater good,”they are actually only talking about their own well-being, not that of thepublic. In fact, many of the actions taken by the corporate and politicalleaders of today seem to follow the millennia-long agenda of attempting tosubjugate the human population. Their decisions are often contrary to any notionof public health and well-being.And it may be worse than this. Many see their activities as yet another attemptto reduce the human population. Concern over population reduction and control bya wealthy ruling elite today is taking center stage in the public’s mind,especially after witnessing the bailout of the plutocrats who were the cause ofthe financial crisis beginning in 2008.Many, like Internet commentator Alex Jones, believe the New World Order agendais to “thin the population leaving only an enslaved underclass who are forced tolive on the poverty line in control grid cities while the overlords enjoy thebountiful paradise of the earth and evolve into super-beings with the aid ofadvanced life-extension technologies.” Jones added that this long-term dream ofthe wealthy elite will become “a nightmare for the rest of humanity unless werise up now and fight back against the systems of control that are being lockeddown to transform the earth into a prison planet.”Economic systems are failing all over the planet, and the only solutionseriously considered by lawmakers is to borrow and print more money, leading toa never-ending spiral of inflation. Such “solutions” serve only to acceleratethe economic collapse. “It’s not a new world order; it’s the bankers’ order,”observed Gerald Celente, author of Trend Tracking. He said control by privatebankers has been a “major issue of this country since its founding up until1913. … They’re moneychangers and loan sharks. Get rid of them.”In addition to the economic problems of humanity, industrialization is taking atoll on the environment. The weather is becoming erratic. Recent years havewitnessed unprecedented tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis.Flooding and droughts are increasing, creating crop failures, food shortages,and higher costs at the grocery stores.Whole populations of bees, birds, and other creatures are being wiped out. Manythink this is due to the variability of nature, but others, with some scientificsupport, blame it on the overuse of pesticides or the use of geneticallymodified organisms (GMOs).Reporting on the lethal failure of nuclear energy has been placed on a backburner by the corporate mass media. The nuclear plants in Fukushima, Japan,damaged from a tsunami created by an offshore earthquake, continue to spewsilent and invisible poison into the atmosphere. Right after the disaster, inMarch 2011, rainwater in Calgary, Canada, had an average of 8.18 becquerels (aunit for measuring radioactivity) per liter of radioactive iodine, easilyexceeding the Canadian guideline of 6 becquerels per liter for drinking water.In late 2011, rainwater captured in St. Louis, Missouri, measured a radiationlevel of 13.3 microsieverts per hour, 130 times normal background radiation.While the public is told that the radiation seeping from the Fukushima reactorsis only at “low” levels and not immediately harmful, they fail to understandthat the food supply has also been irradiated and that radioactive isotopes ofcesium and other elements may persist for centuries. The cumulative effects ofincreasing exposure to ionizing radiation over the course of our lives have beennoted by many people, like Mike Adams on his Natural News website. He asked,“How is the human race going to survive its exposure to CT scans, radioactivefood, chest X-rays, TSA body scanners and even the secret DHS mobile X-ray vansthat can penetrate your body with X-rays as you’re walking into a footballstadium? The total radiation burden on the human race is now reaching a point ofmass infertility. That may be the whole idea, actually.” Recalling the decreasein male sperm count throughout the world today, one may conclude that Adams’sconcern is well justified.A DISASTER IN THE MAKING [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s85]Not long before the Fukushima disaster, another maritime catastrophe caused somuch pollution that it is considered one of the worst environmental disasters ofall time. On April 20, 2010, an explosion at the offshore Deepwater Horizondrilling platform caused untold millions of gallons of petroleum to leak intothe Gulf of Mexico. Operated by British Petroleum (BP), the drilling platformdisaster caused a number of human deaths and illnesses and eradicated hugeswaths of Gulf wildlife. Was this simply a mishap or a plot created by asinister agenda? If nothing else, it is a classic example of the blending ofelitist corporate control and its unceasing demand for profits with a lack ofgovernment accountability, leading to tragedy for millions of people.By the fall of 2010, after the cleanup, the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) declared that air quality on the Gulf coastline was “normal,” andPresident Obama proclaimed the area safe and “open for business.” But the EPAhad made a similar mistake in September 2001, when director Christine ToddWhitman announced in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, “I am glad to reassure thepeople of New York … that their air is safe to breathe and the water is safe todrink.”The EPA was wrong in 2001, and it was probably wrong after the Gulf oil spill.According to several published reports, nearly a thousand 9/11 first respondershave now died from a variety of unidentified causes, and many New Yorkers claima variety of illnesses due to bad air that emanated from the wreckage.Similarly, Gulf Coast residents continue to report serious illnesses that theyblame on toxic water and air caused by the oil blowout and subsequent cleanupactivities. Kim Anderson, professor of environmental and molecular toxicology inthe College of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State University (OSU), confirmedthat toxins were being released into the Gulf. The oil pipe was reportedlysealed on July 15, 2010, but by then massive damage had been done. A study ofwaters off the Louisiana coast showed a fortyfold increase in carcinogens, suchas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), between May and June 2010.Even more disturbing, in late 2011, fresh oil was reported surfacing all overthe northern quadrant of the Gulf of Mexico, with reports of huge expanses ofoil sheen. Francis Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council,who served on President Obama’s National Oil Spill Commission, reported that“tar balls were continuing to wash up on shore, and that oil sheen trails werebeing seen in the wake of fishing boats. Wetlands and marshlands were still indecline and dying; crude oil lay offshore in deep water, as well as fine siltsand sands onshore.”He added, “I have traveled throughout the Gulf Coast, and people routinely tellme that their communities have not recovered economically or psychologically.They are struggling to get their lives back to where they were on April19—before the oil spill took their livelihoods, clean beaches, productive shrimpand oyster fisheries, and family traditions away from them.”Many families have also complained recently about the spraying of toxic oildispersants, such as Corexit. Usually oil floats to the surface of a body ofliquid, but Corexit, a product of the Nalco Holding Company, causes the oil tobreak into small globules that sink to the bottom. One would think that Corexitwouldn’t have been needed after the initial spill, but nearly two years afterthe explosion, Corexit continues to be sprayed in the Gulf states, according toresidents.Darryl Malek-Wiley, an environmental justice organizer with the Sierra Club, hasclaimed that the fishing and environmental community agree that the use of thedispersants was not a smart idea for the long-term health of the region.One point eight million gallons of dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico—nobody’sever put that amount of dispersant anywhere in the world, so we don’t know whatthe impact of that is going to be. Some of the people who are sick, they’retaking samples of their blood and they’re finding the chemicals that make up thedispersants in their blood, as well as Louisiana sweet crude, and having serioushealth impacts … [like] loss of memory, rashes, sinus [problems]. Some folkswe’ve talked with, they forget where they’re going. They forget who you are. Andthese are men, all of them were fishermen in relatively good physical shape. Andwe don’t know about long-term health impacts, but there’s no immediate healthcare for folks who need it right now. And that’s a big concern—people have beenlosing their health insurance because they’re not able to work, and they don’thave money to pay for independent health care … a whole range of things arehappening. A number of them have lost their homes because they weren’t able towork and they didn’t get paid by BP like they said they were gonna be, and so,it’s a serious impact on people’s lives.In a recent Business Insider article, Michael Snyder noted that almost everyperson who worked to clean up the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska haddied. He added, “The truth is that what we have out in the Gulf of Mexico is a‘toxic soup’ of oil, methane, benzene, hydrogen sulfide, other toxic gases andvery poisonous chemical dispersants such as Corexit 9500. Breathing all of thisstuff is not good for your health, but the reality is that the true health tollof this oil spill is not going to be known for decades.”Any truthful investigation of the oil spill must “follow the money.” The companythat owned the Deepwater Horizon was Transocean, a firm saddled with legalproblems, one that had been charged with bribery of foreign governmentalofficials, tax fraud, tax evasion, and falsifying records. In 2007, Transocean’sfinancial advisers, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, helped the company mergewith GlobalSantaFe. This merger brought in a staggering $15 billion toshareholders.Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council,stopped short of calling the BP oil spill a conspiracy. Yet she did state that“the blowout was not the product of a series of aberrational decisions made byrogue industry or government officials that could not have been anticipated orexpected to occur again. Rather, the root causes are systemic and, absentsignificant reform in both industry practices and government policies, mightwell recur.”Radio commentator Dave Hodges, who wrote a series of articles titled The GreatGulf Coast Holocaust, was not so hesitant in pointing the finger of calculatedneglect at BP, Transocean, Goldman Sachs, and Halliburton. According to Hodges,these companies, described as the Four Horsemen, have “repeatedly lied about theecological damage done to the Gulf, lied about the damage done to the people andtheir health, lied about the damage done to the economic health of the Gulf, andcontinue to lie about the failure to properly compensate the victims in the Gulfwhile the continuing and unfolding holocaust is still growing in scope.”It does appear that everyone in the Gulf lost money on the oil spill except BPand its corporate partners. According to the BBC, BP and its Gulf Coastpartners—Goldman Sachs, Transocean, and Halliburton—all experienced major gainsin corporate profits as a result of the spill. Transocean rewarded its topofficials with bonuses for achieving the “best year in safety performance in ourcompany’s history.” Transocean CEO Steve Newman received a bonus payout of$374,062, part of his total compensation package of $5.8 million.Worse yet, internal e-mails revealed that Goldman Sachs profited from the Gulfdisaster by making “a substantial financial bet against the Gulf of Mexico” byshort-selling Transocean stock one day before the explosion. Goldman insidersbet that the stock would go down, which it did in the wake of the explosion, sothey profited. Federal investigators found an e-mail from Goldman employeeFabrice “Fabulous Fab” Tourre in which he bragged to a girlfriend, “One oil riggoes down and we’re going to be rolling in dough. Suck it, fishies and birdies.”Outraged, Sterling Allan wrote on the worldwide blog Examiner.com, “It turns outthat Goldman Sachs really did place shorts on Transocean stock days before theexplosions rocked the rig in the Gulf of Mexico sending stocks plunging while GSprofits soared—benefitting once again from a huge disaster, having done the samewith airline stocks prior to 9/11 then again with the housing bubble.”Goldman Sachs lies at the heart of a money-managing empire that ranges from theExchange Stabilization Fund to Facebook. Former Goldman executives includeRobert Rubin and Henry Paulson, both of whom served as U.S. Treasurysecretaries. A former Goldman Sachs lobbyist named Mark Patterson was namedchief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner even though PresidentObama pledged during his presidential campaign that he would limit the influenceof lobbyists in his administration. Although Timothy Geithner has never workeddirectly for Goldman Sachs, as a former member of the New York Federal ReserveBank, his connections in banking are extensive. In a 2009 interview, formerassistant secretary of the treasury Paul Craig Roberts was asked if Geithnerworks for the people or for the banking system on Wall Street. Roberts replied,“He works for Goldman Sachs.”Aside from its political connections, Goldman Sachs is involved with a number ofdifferent projects and organizations. In the 1990s, Goldman partnered with DavidRockefeller and his associates in ownership of Rockefeller Center. Themultinational investment firm also conducts business with a number of banks,including Citi Investment Research, T. Rowe Price Associates, J.P. Morgan AssetManagement, and Capital World Investors. In 2009, Goldman was investigated forreceiving $12 billion in the bailout of American International Group (AIG) bythe Federal Reserve.Now Goldman Sachs has its hands in one of the largest growing industries—socialmedia. In early 2012, Goldman announced that it was investing $450 million inthe privately owned social network Facebook, valued then at $50 billion. Thedeal came with an additional $50 million investment from Digital SkyTechnologies (DST), a Russian investment firm that also invested in Groupon andZynga, and it will allow Facebook to challenge Google as the most prominent siteon the Internet. Some saw this move as the latest attempt by the banking eliteto control the Internet.FREEMAN OR SERF? [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#s86]Goldman Sachs is large and powerful, yet, it is only one of the globalcorporations that control Congress and generally run the government. Years ago,one American president acknowledged as much. In a letter dated November 23,1933, newly elected president Franklin D. Roosevelt admitted, “The real truth ofthe matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centershas owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.” In light ofRoosevelt’s admission, careful notice should be given to what is happening inmodern America and always under the excuse of protecting the public. And seriousquestions should be asked. These include: * Why, in the name of protecting freedom of speech, are more and more laws being considered to curtail and censor the Internet and hinder free expression in public? * Why do city governments, aided by federal funds, videotape citizens in public places 24/7 for purposes of “public safety,” yet if citizens attempt to videotape police in those same public places, they are subject to threats, beatings, and arrest despite court decisions supporting the First Amendment? * Why does the government claim that every single air traveler must be intimately searched and confirmed harmless in order to protect the safety of a few hundred passengers on the plane, when that very same government conducts no safety testing whatsoever on fluoride chemicals dumped into municipal water supplies, threatening the health of tens of millions? * Why are commercial airline passengers required to submit to X-rays, strip off belts, coats, and shoes, and carry no more than two ounces of liquid, while private aircraft are free to come and go without scrutiny? Can potential terrorists not rent or hire private aircraft? And if there is such a dire threat of terrorists slipping into the United States with chemical or nuclear weapons, why has nothing substantial been done to secure the nation’s borders? * Why do armed government agents raid and arrest farmers for selling fresh milk yet do nothing to protect the public from corporate additives such as MSG, a common food additive linked to obesity. Why does the government continue to allow aspartame in diet soft drinks when it has been shown to cause seizures? Where is the public’s protection from high fructose corn syrup, which increases the risk of diabetes? Why is processed grain used for making bread being cut with bromide, a known tumor-causing agent with “zombifying potential,” instead of using essential iodine, necessary for the normal metabolism of cells, as was done up until the 1980s? Why is sodium nitrite, implicated as a cause of cancer, still found in processed meat? Why is there no prohibition on artificial food colors, many of which are suspected by the FDA as being linked to behavioral and health problems? Millions more Americans consume such problematic additives each day than drink raw milk. * Why is the FDA proposing that traditional nutritional supplements like vitamin C, gingerroot, and echinacea be outlawed pending lengthy new safety reviews and approval processes, while the USDA has approved the widespread experimental planting of genetically modified crops with no safety testing whatsoever under the bizarre reasoning that GMOs are essentially “identical” to non-GMO crops? If they are identical, why are they patented and termed modified? And why have dozens of other nations banned GMO seeds? * Why does the Federal Emergency Management Agency advise citizens to store food and water for a mere three-day emergency, such as a hurricane, while this same federal government has spent billions building massive underground bunker networks where it has stockpiled enough food, water, guns, ammunition, medical supplies, communications equipment, nonhybrid seeds, and much more to last decades? * Why, in the wake of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami that wrecked four nuclear power plants and spewed radiation all the way to the United States, did the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency actually downplay the disaster, stop reporting air quality on the West Coast, and propose increasing the allowable level of radioactive contamination in water, food, and soil? * Why do government health officials claim the right to forcibly vaccinate all children to protect society when, if such vaccinations were effective, all voluntarily vaccinated children would be protected against unvaccinated children?These and many other actions that diminish freedom and actually harm the public,committed regularly over long periods of time, cannot be ascribed simply toaccident, stupidity, individual malfeasance, or bureaucratic incompetence. AsThomas Jefferson once noted, “Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to theaccidental opinion of the day; but a series of oppressions, begun at adistinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of ministerstoo plainly proves a deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to slavery.”Another quote, widely attributed to Jefferson, indicates that we face the sameproblem as the people in his time: “The issue today is the same as it has beenthroughout all history, whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or beruled by a small elite.”Two authors who clearly foresaw the events and policies of today were GeorgeOrwell in his famous book 1984 and Aldous Huxley in Brave New World. In a 1949letter to Orwell, Huxley wrote,Within the next generation I believe that the world’s rulers will discover thatinfant conditioning [dumbed-down education] and narco-hypnosis [drugging] aremore efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and thatthe lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people intoloving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience. In otherwords, I feel that the nightmare of 1984 is destined to modulate into thenightmare of a world having more resemblance to that which I imagined in BraveNew World. The change will be brought about as a result of a felt need forincreased efficiency. Meanwhile, of course, there may be a large scalebiological and atomic war—in which case we shall have nightmares of other andscarcely imaginable kinds.Orwell, especially, may have been in a position to know whereof he wrote. Orwellwas a pen name. His real name was Eric Arthur Blair. Although his family was notwealthy, they were nevertheless members of the British gentry, and Blair managedto study at Eton, where he met Aldous Huxley. Eton has long been accused ofbeing a central education center for Britain’s elite families. Nineteen primeministers, including David Cameron, were educated there. It was at Eton thatBlair was introduced to the Fabian Society, reputed to be a secret society ofthose desiring worldwide socialism. Blair eventually left the society, provokingsome to speculate that his 1948 book, 1984, actually is an exposé of the plansof the wealthy elite rulers. Whether this is true or not, 1984 is amazinglyprescient in its account of a future global totalitarian socialist state. In thebook, the world had been divided into three economic blocs called Oceania,Eurasia, and Eastasia. Today, we witness the existing European Union, themuch-mentioned North American Union, and a future Asian union. Blair’sneologisms—doublethink, Newspeak, and Thought Police—reflect current trends andnow are being used widely by conspiracy writers.Concerns over what many see as a move toward a totalitarian police state haverevived the age-old queries: Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? Agrowing number of people are questioning the nature of our “reality.” Why areall paths and aids to self-discovery continually denied us by religious andsecular authorities? Why are the air, water, and food of our world being filledwith toxins that hinder both physical and spiritual development? Why is almosteverything humans naturally enjoy discouraged, restricted, controlled, oroutlawed?Will it be only a handful of youthful protesters who stand against theconcentrated power of the banks and corporations? “The only word thesecorporations know is more,” wrote Chris Hedges, former correspondent for theChristian Science Monitor, National Public Radio, and the New York Times.They are disemboweling every last social service program funded by thetaxpayers, from education to Social Security, because they want that moneythemselves. Let the sick die. Let the poor go hungry. Let families be tossed inthe street. Let the unemployed rot. Let children in the inner city or ruralwastelands learn nothing and live in misery and fear. Let the students finishschool with no jobs and no prospects of jobs. Let the prison system, the largestin the industrial world, expand to swallow up all potential dissenters. Lettorture continue. Let teachers, police, firefighters, postal employees andsocial workers join the ranks of the unemployed. Let the roads, bridges, dams,levees, power grids, rail lines, subways, bus services, schools and librariescrumble or close. Let the rising temperatures of the planet, the freak weatherpatterns, the hurricanes, the droughts, the flooding, the tornadoes, the meltingpolar ice caps, the poisoned water systems, the polluted air increase until thespecies dies.There are no excuses left. Either you join the revolt taking place on WallStreet and in the financial districts of other cities across the country or youstand on the wrong side of history. Either you obstruct, in the only form leftto us, which is civil disobedience, the plundering by the criminal class on WallStreet and accelerated destruction of the ecosystem that sustains the humanspecies, or become the passive enabler of a monstrous evil. Either you taste,feel and smell the intoxication of freedom and revolt or sink into the miasma ofdespair and apathy. Either you are a rebel or a slave.To be declared innocent in a country where the rule of law means nothing, wherewe have undergone a corporate coup, where the poor and working men and women arereduced to joblessness and hunger, where war, financial speculation and internalsurveillance are the only real business of the state, where even habeas corpusno longer exists, where you, as a citizen, are nothing more than a commodity tocorporate systems of power, one to be used and discarded, is to be complicit inthis radical evil. To stand on the sidelines and say “I am innocent” is to bearthe mark of Cain; it is to do nothing to reach out and help the weak, theoppressed and the suffering, to save the planet. To be innocent in times likethese is to be a criminal.When Hedges rails against the “criminal class on Wall Street,” he is speaking ofthe global super-rich, the bloodlines who, as we have seen, can be traced backto our earliest history.Recent news concerning financial meltdowns, polluted air, degradation of theenvironment, covert aerial spraying, faulty products, untested drugs,adulterated vaccines, and contaminated food and water raises these questions:Why are these corporate and political elites making decisions that are harmfulto the planet and its population? What humans in their right mind would want todestroy the Earth, killing the source and sustenance of life? Would they reallykill the goose that lays golden eggs? Can such concerted efforts be explainedaway as psychopathic behavior or mere corporate ignorance and greed?Only through persistent study, curiosity, and critical thinking will individualsbecome aware that our history has been corrupted and suppressed. Such hiding oftruth raises many unanswered questions. But the primary ones are: Who hasdirected our occulted history? And to what end? Humanity appears to be in afootrace to see whether we will gain true freedom and liberty or submit to thetechnological and totalitarian world envisioned by Huxley and Orwell andpromoted by Perkins’s corporatocracy.And other questions remain. The evidence of ancient nonhuman visitation iscompelling, almost overwhelming. Cave drawings, cuneiform tablets of clay,biblical descriptions, and existing anomalous artifacts attest to the reality ofsuch a presence down through history. Assuming the ancient Sumerian tablets arebased on truth, extraterrestrials were on Earth millennia ago. Did they allleave at some point, or are some still here?The answer may be found by simply reviewing human history. We are taught thathumans slowly evolved from hunter-gatherers to farmers who gathered incity-states, which became nations and empires. Yet a close scrutiny of historyalso tells of legends of marvelous lost civilizations, amazing artifacts, andreports from around the world of gods flying in ancient times—the flying dragonsof the Chinese, the vimanas of the Hindus, the soaring boats of the Egyptians,the flying shields of Alexander, the airships of 1896–97 and the UFOs of today.Someone has been with us all through recorded history.It also can be demonstrated that a mere handful of bloodline-fixated individualshiding behind corporate fronts, foundations, and government bureaucracies areseeking to control the wealth and knowledge of the planet. Here there seem to bebut three possibilities: members of the ruling elite are using modern technologyin an effort to contact the ancient gods; they already have contacted theancient gods and are being guided or controlled by them; or they are the ancientgods, the Anunnaki, the shining ones of antiquity.It may well be time to ask in all seriousness: Are they even us? Do they want usout of the way? Should we be mobilizing for a concerted defense of Earth? And isthere any nonhuman counteracting force to which we may look for hope andassistance? Or is it time for the average person to get off the couch and dosomething to counteract the control freaks bent on ruling the world?The answer to the last question is up to you."},{"pageContent":"Sources [9780062130334_Contents.xhtml#sou01]INTRODUCTIONHoward Phillips Lovecraft, The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (NewYork: Penguin, 1999), 139.Interbreeding bloodlines: David Icke, The Biggest Secret: The Book That WillChange the World (Scottsdale, AZ: Bridge of Love Publications, 1999), 1.Carl Sagan on the reptilian complex: “Order of Melchizedek,”www.thehermetica.com/thereptilianbrain.htm.“I think we’re property”: Charles Fort, The Complete Books of Charles Fort (NewYork: Dover, 1974), 163 (in The Book of the Damned).“Not pseudoscientific speculation”: “Ancient Astronauts,”www.skepdic.com/vondanik.html.We were not alone: Philip Coppens, The Ancient Alien Question: A New Inquiryinto the Existence, Evidence, and Influence of Ancient Visitors (Pompton Plains,NJ: New Page Books, 2012), 287.Human race as source of labor: William Bramley, The Gods of Eden (San Jose, CA:Dahlin Family Press, 1990), 37.Enough evidence of AB involvement: Paul Von Ward, We’ve Never Been Alone: AHistory of Extraterrestrial Intervention (Charlottesville, VA: Hampton Roads,2011), 367.Paul White on patriarchs: “Subterranean Tunnels, Underground Alien Bases,”www.burlingtonnews.net/tunnels.PART I: ORIGINS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEMRupert Sheldrake: www.holoscience.com/wp/links.BIG BANG QUESTIONEDPaul J.
