Most peoplethroughout history have been happy just to be alive. They have sought, in thewords of the Declaration of Independence, “life, liberty and the pursuit ofhappiness.”Many Americans now recognize how far we have strayed from this ideal.America is experiencing a dangerous transformation, through which the globalelite has used every tactic available in a conspiracy to hoard an even greatershare of wealth and reduce the world’s population. And it is working. ManyAmericans have been drawn not toward life but toward servitude and death. InAmerica and in the world as a whole, entire populations have been culled forprofit and control. Elites have used the so-called GOD syndicate—Guns, Oil, andDrugs—as well as toxic air, water, food, and medicines, and of course, the toxicfinancial system on which the whole master plan depends—to reduce the world’spopulation. This is due to the belief of the global elite that the basis of allthe world’s problems is overpopulation—just too many people using the earth’slimited resources.Guns, Oil, and Drugs are the top three revenue-generating commodities in theworld today, and they form the financial backbone of the global elites. Allthree are trafficked internationally, generating huge profits for those whocontrol them, and are becoming ever more important in today’s economy. Americahas gone to war for oil, supplied its military (not to mention private citizens)with firearms, and been complicit in a global drug trade. And behind the scenes,a wealthy elite has profited tremendously from all three.The food, water, and air we consume are also in a state of decay. We believethis decay is normal, the way things have always been. We discount theoverwhelming evidence that these are recent developments. We now live in aculture of death and decay that has been imposed upon us by a small group ofwealthy elites that publicly espouses involuntary population reduction. We’rebeing killed by chemicals, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), dyes,additives, plastics, tainted water, and polluted air. Numerous common householditems are actually powerfully toxic: aspartame, fluoride, GMOs, pesticides,high-fructose corn syrup, pharmaceutical drugs, cell phones, microwaves, evenbasic electricity. Even though food is plentiful in America, our bodies receivefewer nutrients than they did fifty years earlier.The commercial products we use every day contain more than eighty-five thousandchemicals; our food and water are poisoned as well.Until the 1950s, the U.S. was predominately a rural nation. People mostly atefresh home-grown garden foods. No foods contained genetically modified organisms(GMOs), and chemical food additives were rarely used. Beginning in the late1940s, corporate food producers increasingly began offering processed,nutrient-deficient foods previously unknown in human history. Children growingup in the 1960s were, for the first time, subjected to imitation foods,processed consumables that appeared and tasted nutritious but lacked any realnourishment. By the 1970s, the American diet consisted of non-nutritious whitebread and other unnatural food products. By the 1980s, Americans, raised onimitation foods, drinking fluoridated water, and distracted by disco, had becomeapathetic and lazy.We are not aware of these things because precious few recognize that we arebeing psychologically programmed by a mass media controlled by a mere handful ofcorporate owners. This handful of multinational media corporations, many withinterlocking directors and owners, control everything we see and hear, frommovies, TV, and newspapers to satellite networks, magazines, even book clubs andbillboards. Indeed, the complicity of the mass media ensures that we cannotprotest the population reduction that threatens our very lives.In fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the state gained control over thecorporations. In modern America, corporations have gained control over thestate. The end result is the same.Giant corporations, owned by a small globalist elite, have thrived often bydeceptive and illegal practices. In 1952, corporations accounted for 32 percentof federal tax revenues. By 2013, this number was less than 10 percent. In thatsame year, forty-six U.S. corporations were blacklisted for corruption by theWorld Bank. And these corrupt tactics create wealth for only a select few;economic reality in the U.S. today substantiates the old line about the richgetting richer while the poor get poorer.A 2014 survey by the Russell Sage Foundation found that during the recenteconomic downturn, lower-income households lost a larger portion of their wealththan those with higher incomes. The study revealed a “startling decline” inwealth nationwide. The median household in 2013 had a net worth of just$56,335—43 percent lower than the median wealth level right before the recessionbegan in 2007, and 36 percent lower than a decade ago. “There are very few signsof significant recovery from the losses in wealth suffered by American familiesduring the Great Recession,” concluded the researchers.Meanwhile, the share of wealth enjoyed by the global elite only increases. Whathas been described as the “one percent” actually is more like the “.01 percent.”What’s worse is that one cannot know exactly how much these people are worth,since much of their wealth is hidden in offshore bank accounts. “At thecommanding heights of the U.S. economy, hiding a lot of one’s wealth offshore isprobably the norm, not the exception,” noted Paul Krugman in the New York Times.Everyone has heard of some rich Americans: the Rockefellers, Warren Buffett, theKoch brothers, George Soros, and Donald Trump are a few examples of highlyvisible wealthy Americans. But most of the names of the true one-percenters—thebillionaires—are unknown to the public.Yet these faceless billionaires run the world’s financial and political systems,and their wealth and power is only growing greater. The four hundred richestAmericans made $200 billion in 2013, a total equal to the combined amount spenton the federal food-stamp, education, and housing programs. Ninety-five percentof all new income generated between 2009 and 2012 went to the wealthiest onepercent, who own 38 percent of the nation’s financial wealth, while the bottom60 percent owns just 2.3 percent of the nation’s wealth.Income inequality gained increased public visibility with the 2014 publicationof a book entitled Capital in the Twenty-First Century by French economistThomas Piketty, who argued that inequality of capital produces an ever-growingdisparity in wealth. This idea does not sit well with those who believecapitalism requires inequality of wealth and that taxes on wealth, capital,inheritance, and property are inimical to growth.Piketty argues that the response to wealth inequality should be a top income taxrate of up to 80 percent, an effective inheritance tax, increased propertytaxes, and even a global wealth tax. But he acknowledged such measures arecurrently inconceivable, as anyone with money wants to keep it, and those inthis wealthy elite are the primary financiers of the American political system.It’s no wonder that government has done little to curb the power of corporationswhose destructive actions are endangering our lives; our political leadersdepend upon this corporate blood money for their election.These corporations, however, are anything but faceless. Every company is ownedand operated by individuals, men and women with names and addresses. Thesepersons have family, friends, and private lives. Collectively, they callthemselves “globalists,” men and women who have a right to dominate based onwealth, heritage, and bloodline. They view the entire planet as their privateplaying field. They can be identified and located. And they have a plan tocontrol the globe, one formulated many years ago within secretive societies inboth Britain and the U.S. It depends upon killing most of us. Here is that plan."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-3]DEPOPULATION [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-3]THE GEORGIA GUIDESTONES IS A MONUMENT IN ELBERT COUNTY, Georgia. It is composedof four sixteen-foot-tall stones that have been called the American Stonehenge.Indeed, its origin is as mysterious as its English namesake. Commissioned in1979 by a man using the pseudonym R. C. Christian, the monument was constructedby the Eberton Granite Finishing Company and completed in 1980. An accompanyingtablet states that the sponsors of the stones are “a small group of Americanswho seek the Age of Reason.” A message is inscribed on the stones in eightmodern languages and four ancient ones.Below the title Let These Be Guidestones to the Age of Reason, the engravedmessage reads:MAINTAIN HUMANITY UNDER 500,000,000 IN PERPETUAL BALANCE WITH NATURE.GUIDE REPRODUCTION WISELY—IMPROVING FITNESS AND DIVERSITY.UNITE HUMANITY WITH A LIVING NEW LANGUAGE.RULE PASSION—FAITH—TRADITION—AND ALL THINGS WITH TEMPERED REASON.PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATIONS WITH FAIR LAWS AND JUST COURTS.LET ALL NATIONS RULE INTERNALLY RESOLVING EXTERNAL DISPUTES IN A WORLD COURT.AVOID PETTY LAWS AND USELESS OFFICIALS.BALANCE PERSONAL RIGHTS WITH SOCIAL DUTIES.PRIZE TRUTH—BEAUTY—LOVE—SEEKING HARMONY WITH THE INFINITE.BE NOT A CANCER ON THE EARTH—LEAVE ROOM FOR NATURE—LEAVE ROOM FOR NATURE.Some view the stones as offering reasonable and rational suggestions fordeveloping a peaceful and just world. Others see something more sinister. Oneconspiracy website noted astronomical features within the stones. The four majorstones are oriented to reflect the migration limits of the sun during the year,while a hole in the center stone always aligns with the North Star and anotherhole aligns with the rising sun during the summer and winter solstices. Suchcelestial alignments are found in the works of secret societies from theFreemasons to the Druids and the Mystery Schools of ancient Greece and Egypt.“The monument is therefore proof of an existing link between secret societies,the world elite and the push for a New World Order,” declared the website. In2008, vandals defaced the monument with the words “Death to the New WorldOrder.”The stones’ first admonition is the most disconcerting to many, as the worldpopulation in mid-2014 stood at nearly seven and a half billion persons. If theGuidestones’ mandate to hold the human population to five hundred million isachieved, what is to happen to the other seven billion?England’s Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and a prominent globalist, mayhave revealed the views of the global elite when in 1981 he told Peoplemagazine, “Human population growth is probably the single most serious long-termthreat to survival. We’re in for a major disaster if it isn’t curbed—not justfor the natural world, but for the human world. The more people there are, themore resources they’ll consume, the more pollution they’ll create, the morefighting they will do. We have no option. If it isn’t controlled voluntarily, itwill be controlled involuntarily by an increase in disease, starvation and war.”Years later, Philip mused, “In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like toreturn as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solveoverpopulation.”As one of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Prince Philip once laidout a globalist justification for depopulation. “The object of the WWF,” hewrote, “is to ‘conserve’ the system as a whole; not to prevent the killing ofindividual animals. Those who are concerned about the conservation of natureaccept . . . that most species produce a surplus that is capable of being culledwithout in any way threatening the survival of the species as a whole.”Other globalist leaders agree with this chilling assessment. In a 1981 interviewconcerning overpopulation, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff MaxwellTaylor said by the beginning of the twenty-first century, it would be necessaryto reduce the world’s population, mostly in third-world countries, using methodssuch as disease, starvation, and regional wars. He blithely concluded, “I havealready written off more than a billion people. These people are in places inAfrica, Asia, and Latin America. We can’t save them. The population crisis andthe food-supply question dictate that we should not even try. It’s a waste oftime.”Such brutal tactics have even been incorporated into national policy in somecountries, including the United States. In 1974, the U.S. National SecurityCouncil issued a classified study entitled “National Security Study Memorandum(NSSM) 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security andOverseas Interests.” Known as the Kissinger Report, the study stated thatpopulation growth in the so-called Lesser Developed Countries (LDCs) representeda serious threat to U.S. national security. The study was adopted as officialgovernment policy in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford and itsimplementation assigned to Brent Scowcroft, who had replaced Kissinger asnational security adviser. NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce populationgrowth in LDCs through birth control, and what many have interpreted as war andfamine. Then CIA director George H. W. Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft, aswere the secretaries of state, treasury, defense, and agriculture. This policymay even have supported the many wars and airstrikes in the Middle East leadingto a decimation of the populations there.There is even significant evidence that claims of overpopulation are spurious.It seems the real issue is one of population density rather than populationgrowth. For example, according to the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, thestate covers an area of 69,903 square miles. If each person is allowed onehundred square feet of living space, Oklahoma could accommodate 19.49 billionpeople—nearly three times the earth’s current population of seven billion.Of course, this merely illustrates that that the earth still has plenty of roomfor everyone, not that everyone would want to live in one state. If the world’spopulation could spread out, and avoid concentrating in sprawling metropolitancenters, citizens would most likely be much happier and better off. As is,crowding in cities produces the unwelcome effects of crime, congestion,pollution, and stress. Studies have shown that lab rats are content in theircages until too many in too close contact cause them to turn on each other.Yet, leading one-percenters continue to echo the tone of NSSM 200 and PrincePhilip’s remarks. On May 5, 2009, some of America’s leading billionaires met ina private Manhattan home just a week before the annual meeting of the secretiveBilderbergers. Calling themselves the “Good Club,” attendees reportedly includedBill Gates, David Rockefeller Jr., Warren Buffett, George Soros, New York mayorMichael Bloomberg, Ted Turner, and Oprah Winfrey. According to John Harlow ofthe Sunday Times, the group—while not going so far as to advocate activedepopulation strategies—agreed with Gates that human overpopulation was apriority concern. Harlow said there was nothing as crude as a vote but aconsensus was reached that “they would back a strategy in which populationgrowth would be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental, social andindustrial threat.”Apparently, those with great wealth and power have decided to takeoverpopulation into their own hands. Dave Hodges, host of The Common Sense Show,recalled how President Ronald Reagan once remarked that a threat by space aliensmight be the unifying force necessary to bring the nations of the Earth togetherin a common cause. Hodges warned, “Indeed, all of mankind does face a commonfoe. However, it is not aliens. Our common foe is the elite that presume thatthey have the God-given right to exert ownership over all of us including theright to life or death. And for 95 percent of us, the elite are actively engagedin systematic extermination of mankind.”And some of today’s elite can be connected to the same families and corporationsthat funded communism in Russia and then national socialism in prewar Germany.In noting the similarities between the rise of the Nazis and modern America, Dr.Len Horowitz said, “Today with AIDS, mad cow disease, chronic fatigue, and therest, history is apparently repeating. In fact, even the message is the same.The millions of Holocaust victims were told they were going into ‘showers’ for‘public health’ and ‘disinfection.’ That’s why we are being told to getvaccinated. Virtually nothing has changed, not even the message.”The late Donald W. Scott, schoolteacher and author of The Brucellosis Triangleand a Canadian political candidate, has speculated that as far back as the 1940sthere existed a high-level agenda to research a viral pandemic of brucellosis bytesting it on unwitting U.S. citizens, a project Scott suggests was initiated bypersons holding sway over government officials: “The Washington corner of thebrucellosis triangle with its military, NIH [National Institutes of Health],Treasury and Justice [Department] components have had their ties to and havelargely taken their directions from the New York corner dominated by theRockefeller interests. And the Rockefeller interests through the agency of theCFR [Council on Foreign Relations], the Rockefeller Institute/University, theCold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the Rockefeller Foundation and the ChaseManhattan Bank [now simply Chase] have constituted a vast machine of power andbaleful influence whose parts have meshed together in an effort to maintain thatpower.”As detailed in my book The Rise of the Fourth Reich, the Rockefeller family laidthe foundation for many of America’s major medical institutions beginning at theend of the Civil War. Besides funding universities and the eugenics movement,Rockefeller largess includes such entities as the Rockefeller SanitaryCommission, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now RockefellerUniversity), and the General Education Board, which expended massive funds onmedical schools to produce doctors inclined to allopathic medicine (thepredominant use of drugs and surgery).But many question whether overpopulation truly is a problem of the magnitudebeing argued by the wealthy one percent and their corporate mass media.In mid-2014, Business Insider published an article by Marian Swain, aconservation and development policy analyst for the Breakthrough Institute, athink tank dedicated to modernizing environmentalism for the twenty-firstcentury.Swain reported that while the world population continues to grow, the rate ofgrowth actually has been decreasing since a peak in the 1960s. Between 1965 and1970, the world population growth rate increased by 2.1 percent. Currently, theworld population is growing at half this number, only about 1.2 percent peryear. She wrote, “We are already experiencing a slowdown in population growth,and it is expected to continue in the coming decades. The UN’s median scenarioprojects flat or decreasing population size in all regions except Africa. Otherprojections suggest that the global population may even peak this century.”She also noted that new technology may increase the earth’s food-producingcapacity, alleviating fears that food production methods will be unable to keeppace with population growth. “It is sometimes suggested that there are hardbiological limits to how much food the earth can produce, but ever since theinvention of agriculture 10,000 years ago humans have been consistentlyincreasing yields through the use of new technologies, such as herbicides,growth stimulants and mechanization. Indeed, it has been increasing yields thathave allowed the human population to grow to its current population of sevenbillion. In this sense, the earth’s carrying capacity is not bound by a finiteset of planetary boundaries, but rather is a function of human technology,” shewrote.She added that while population is undoubtedly a factor in anthropogenic climatechange, as human activities do create greenhouse-gas emissions, a far largerfactor is the kind of energy being used. “One billion people on the planetgetting electricity from coal would create more carbon emissions than 6 billionpeople each getting the same amount of electricity from solar or nuclear power.To combat climate change, technology is more important than population.”Swain also noticed that fertility (the average number of children a woman givesbirth to in her life) is closely correlated with development. She said UNstatistics show “the countries with the highest fertility rates are generallythe poorest ones, while almost all the richest countries have fertility ratesthat are actually below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.”Citing a clear correlation between fertility and development, Swain notes thatas incomes around the world increased between 1910 and 2010, fertility ratesfell dramatically. “In the developing world, people are increasingly moving tocities, gaining access to modern services, and the fertility rates of thesecountries have, in turn, been falling . . . There is even evidence that exposureto modern media like television can create downward pressure on family size,”she wrote, adding, “This is not to say that we should not do anything to promotelower birth rates . . . However, access to contraception is only one of manyfactors that affect women’s fertility choices. Broader issues of poverty andeducation are also crucial to address if we hope to encourage women to choosesmaller family sizes.”Yet despite evidence that fears of population growth are overblown, theglobalists seeking population reduction have continued their systematicelimination of huge numbers of people. This population reduction has taken manyforms. Following the 2009 outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 influenza virus), it wasfound that the strain contained a combination of genes from swine, bird, andhuman influenza viruses. Because this virus could not be contracted by eatingpork or pork products, researchers suspected swine flu was manufactured byhumans. They believed the outbreak was one of several venues being used toreduce the human population by the global elite, who have long supportedeugenics, the social philosophy of improving genetic traits by eliminating lessdesirable people.In the early 1970s, Associate Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may havebetrayed the views of many globalist intellectuals when she said she believedthe Roe v. Wade abortion decision was predicated on the Supreme Court majority’sdesire to diminish “populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” Sheadded that it was then her expectation that the right to abortion would later beexpanded to “Medicaid funding for abortion.”Where did Ginsburg get the idea that American policy-making elites wereinterested in decreasing undesirable populations? Some researchers suggest thatGinsburg, at some point, became acquainted with the writings of John Holdren orother similar writers in the most militant branch of the population controlmovement. In 1977, Mr. Holdren was a young academic who assisted birth controlguru Paul Ehrlich and his wife Anne in writing Ecoscience: Population,Resources, Environment.In this book, Ehrlich wrote, “Many of my colleagues feel that some sort ofcompulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control [overpopulation growth]. One plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporarysterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would becarefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.”Expressing the desire for “a Planetary regime” by controlling all human economicactivity and interactions with the environment, the Ehrlichs and Holdren urgedgovernments to use “power to enforce the agreed limits” on population growth bywhatever means necessary, including involuntary sterilization, abortion, or evenmass involuntary sterilization through chemicals in public water supplies.With Holdren contributing, the book noted “a program of sterilizing women aftertheir second or third child . . . might be easier to implement than trying tosterilize men” and that “compulsory population-control laws, even including lawsrequiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existingConstitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger thesociety.” In 2009, during Senate confirmation hearings, Holdren tersely claimedhe had renounced such views.It should be pointed out that amid the Obama administration’s efforts to imposecentralized and universal Obamacare, John Holdren sits as the president’sdirector of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. As “scienceczar,” Holdren counsels the president on the role of science in public policy.“This relationship has a certain Strangelovian undercurrent, given Holdren’senthusiasm for eugenicist and totalitarian methods of population ‘management,’”notes Internet blogger and radio host William Norman Grigg.G. Edward Griffin, author of The Creature from Jekyll Island, a history of theFederal Reserve System, has also voiced concern over Holdren’s thoughts onmartial law and depopulation. Noting Holdren’s early mention of forced abortionsand putting sterilization chemicals in the water supply in the 1970s book,Griffin stated that Holdren seemed to have advanced the idea of reducing thepopulation by insidious means. “He was not concerned with the ethical or freedomissues involved with these measures, only their practicality. Now we find thissame man, an academic expert on population reduction, at the right hand of thePresident of The United States,” Griffin notes.And he adds, “Remember, all of those who hold power in the governments of theworld today [the self-styled globalists] are collectivists and the guiding ruleof collectivism is that individuals and minorities must be sacrificed, ifnecessary, for the greater good of the state or of society. Of course, those whorule will decide what the greater good is and who is to be sacrificed.”This, of course, is the basic problem with population control. The idea oflimiting the burgeoning earth’s population may appear desirable, as theincreasing number of humans as well as their waste continues placing a strain onthe planet. The burning question is who gets to decide which segments of thepopulation must forgo childbearing for the good of the majority. So far, it isthe wealthy globalists who have taken the lead in supporting ways to hold downpopulation growth through eugenics, drugs, and birth-control measures.Catherine Austin Fitts, who served as former Assistant Secretary of Housingunder the administration of George H. W. Bush, has explained why depopulationmay be one of the globalists’ foremost goals. “My simple calculations guessedthat we were going to achieve economic sustainability on Earth by depopulatingdown to a population of approximately 500 million people . . . I was . . . usedto looking at numbers from a very high level. To me, we had to have radicalchange in how we governed resources or depopulate. It was a mathematicalresult.”Fitts noted that some government budget analysts have concluded that the nationcan no longer afford social safety nets like Social Security and Medicare. “Thatis, unless you change the actuarial assumptions in the budget—like lifeexpectancy,” she said. “Lowering immune systems and increasing toxicity levelscombined with poor food, water and terrorizing stress will help do the trick.”She envisioned a pandemic that would so frighten the public that they could becontrolled and even accept the end of current government benefits. The growingscares over Ebola, E. coli, and the various deadly influenzas may eventuallyachieve this end.Some very strange and scary incidents that do not portend well for populationgrowth have been reported. For example, in 2012, Sara Barron, then a thirty-yearnursing veteran, witnessed separate incidences of anencephaly, a horrible birthdefect in which babies are born missing parts of their brain and skull. Barronhad encountered this problem only twice in her career. Now there were two caseswithin two months and in the same small rural hospital in Washington State.Other such cases were found and the state department of health was notified.They discovered that between January 2010 and January 2013, there were 23 casesof anencephaly in a three-county area. This meant a rate of 8.4 cases per tenthousand live births—four times higher than the national average.The puzzle deepened when no cause could be immediately discovered for thistragic condition. Furthermore, there was criticism that not enough was beingdone to locate a cause. Mothers of these babies said they were never contactedby medical authorities investigating the brainless births.A study of medical records proved fruitless, which did not surprise Dr. BeateRitz, vice chair of the epidemiology department at the UCLA Fielding School ofPublic Health. Ritz said such records are notoriously unreliable. She added thatstate health departments simply do not have the money to conduct in-depthresearch.Meanwhile, Nurse Barron said, “I think it’s very scary. I think there’sabsolutely something going on that needs to be investigated more thoroughly. Iwish they would take it more seriously.”In addition to strange diseases and conditions, deadly food additives,contaminated water, and vaccines all are contributing to population reduction,as will be described in the following pages. One must ask if this is simplycoincidence or inattention, or if there is a conscious agenda to depopulate theworld."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-5]THE DEADLY GOD SYNDICATE [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-5]THE WORLD SPENDS THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SUM OF ABOUT $1 trillion annually onmilitary hardware. This includes small arms, armored vehicles, ships andsubmarines, and aircraft. Arms procurement can represent up to 30 percent of anation’s military budget.The United States has been the world’s largest arms dealer for many years,peddling more weapons than Russia and China combined. Between 2003 and 2011, theUnited States ranked first in arms transfer agreements with developing nations,with U.S. agreements over this period worth a total of $56.3 billion, or 78.7percent of the value of all such agreements worldwide. And America’s closestcompetitors over this time frame were not really competitors at all. Russiaranked second with $4.1 billion in arms transfers, or just 5.7 percent of suchagreements. China, often said to be a threat to the U.S., registered only ameasly 3 percent.Due to the current global economic downturn, many weapons-exporting nations,facing increased competition, have begun expanding into new markets. Richard F.Grimmett, author of a Congressional Research Service report on the matter, notedthat despite a global decline in arms sales in 2011, the U.S. recorded an“extraordinary” increase in market share, primarily due to massive sales toSaudi Arabia and India. Such increased arms sales indicated an effort to exertAmerican influence in both the Middle East and in India, the largest block toChinese expansion in the East.The numbers above account only for government-to-government foreign militarysales (FMS). These statistics do not include private or illegal sales, which aresubstantial, and came to public attention during the “Fast and Furious”gun-walking scandal in 2012, in which the U.S. government was complicit inallowing guns to pass into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. According toTransparency International, an organization that monitors corruption, theinternational trade in armaments is among the most corrupt businesses in theworld. Illegal arms transfers undermine many developing countries’ chances ofachieving their development goals by draining their resources, and in somecases, fueling armed conflict.BLACK MARKET ARMSTHE U.S. HAS THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF BEING THE LEADER NOT ONLY in legal arms salesbut also in the shadowy world of black-market weapon sales. These illegal armsoften fall into the hands of America’s worst enemies, including terrorists.Recent international events have underscored U.S. involvement in the illegalinternational arms trade. The 2011 ouster of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the2012 murder of U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, and the Obamaadministration’s arming of Syrian rebels attacking the government of Syrianpresident Bashar al-Assad were all connected to under-the-table transfers ofarms by the United States.Various sources allege that a program known as Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) isbehind this bloody turmoil. This group operates within the U.S. StateDepartment’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC). The DCS programregulates private U.S. companies’ overseas sales of weapons and other defensearticles, defense services, and military training. It is separate from theForeign Military Sales (FMS) program, which manages government-to-governmentsales. Through DCS, vast sums of money are shuffled through international banks,multinational corporations, and foreign governments.According to a report by the American Federation of Scientists, the StateDepartment is much less transparent about DCS than the Pentagon is about FMS.“Minimal information about price and quantity is classified as ‘confidentialbusiness information’ and kept from the public. This secrecy undermines theability of Congress and the interested press and public to exercise properoversight on industry-direct arms transfers.”In mid-June 2013, the White House announced that President Obama had authorized“direct military support” to Syrian rebel forces, thus allowing DCS to operatein that Middle East nation. According to a Reuters news dispatch, “Syrian rebeland political opposition leaders immediately called for anti-aircraft and othersophisticated weaponry. The arrival of thousands of seasoned, Iran-backedHezbollah Shi’ite fighters to help Assad combat the mainly Sunni rebellion hasshifted momentum in the two-year-old war, which the United Nations said . . .had killed at least 93,000 people.”On September 17, 2013, the White House announced that President Obama had waivedportions of a federal law aimed at preventing the sale of arms to terroristgroups. He did this so that the Syrian rebels could legally be supplied weaponryand ammunition. This waiver could prove problematic, according to the WashingtonExaminer, since a significant portion of the Syrian opposition has beenconnected to radical Islamic terrorist groups including al-Qaeda and ISIS [theIslamic State of Iraq and al-Sham].For several years American intelligence agents operating from a number of safehouses in Syria aided in the sale of arms to the Syrian rebels even to theextent of deciding which terrorist gang or commander should receive the weaponsas they arrived. The New York Times in March 2013 reported the scale of armsshipments was “very large,” and that the Turkish government exercised oversightover much of the operation. “A conservative estimate of the payload of theseflights would be 3,500 tons of military equipment,” stated Hugh Griffiths, anillicit arms transfers monitor for the Stockholm International Peace ResearchInstitute. “The intensity and frequency of these flights are suggestive of awell-planned and coordinated clandestine military logistics operation.”In early 2015, the Citizens Commission on Benghazi (CCB), a group of privatecitizens that included former military commanders and Special Forces operatives,former CIA and intelligence officers, international terrorism experts, andpersons knowledgeable in media and government affairs, confirmed that U.S.officials were providing weaponry to American’s enemies. A CCB interim reportentitled “Changing Sides in the War on Terror” concluded that the Obama WhiteHouse and the State Department under the management of Secretary of StateHillary Clinton “changed sides in the war on terror” in 2011 with a policy ofsending weapons to the al-Qaeda-dominated rebel militias in Libya attempting tooust Muammar Gaddafi from power.“The rebels made no secret of their Al Qaeda affiliation,” said report authorJohn Rosenthal. “And yet, the White House and senior congressional membersdeliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support toterrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler who had been working closelywith the West actively to suppress al Qaeda.” Some claim Gaddafi was overthrownwith U.S. assistance because he was about to create an African “dinar” backed bygold that would have undercut the U.S. dollar.“Stevens was facilitating the delivery of weapons to the al-Qaida-relatedmilitia in Libya,” confirmed Clare Lopez, a former CIA operations officer andmember of the commission who is currently vice president for research at theWashington-based Center for Security Policy.Kevin Shipp, a former CIA counterintelligence expert, and Lopez both agreed thatthe gunrunning operation bordered on treasonous activity and is a secret theObama White House and Clinton State Department sought to suppress from thepublic.In the “Blue Lantern” program, the DDTC monitors end-use recipients of weaponsand services licensed by the State Department and provided by DCS. This programis intended to ensure that arms do not fall into the wrong hands. But somedefense industry sources now claim that DCS is “playing both sides against themiddle for corporate or political gain.”William Robert “Tosh” Plumlee, a former CIA contract pilot who flew arms andammunition for the agency as far back as the overthrow of Cuban dictatorFulgencio Batista and the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, questioned if such armsdealing might be another “off-the-books” covert operation run by the CIA’sSpecial Tactical Unit akin to the arms-for-drugs deal in Iran-Contra and theCuban Project of the 1950s, in which both Fidel Castro and the Batistagovernment in Cuba were sold weapons from American stockpiles for corporateprofit. Numerous field reports have stated Plumlee flew arms to Nicaragua duringthe Iran-Contra Scandal. In testimony to the U.S. Senate, Plumlee also said hereturned to the U.S. with loads of cocaine during the Reagan years. Recently,Plumlee has worked as a photojournalist along the U.S.-Mexican border andparticipated in investigations into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms andExplosives’ (ATF) Fast and Furious sting operation.Blue Lantern reports, which date back to the early 2000s, confirm that manyinvestigations of the end users of weaponry supplied by U.S. firms were“unfavorable,” with arms sometimes ending up in the hands of foreign enemies.Although law enforcement agencies receive these reports in order to evaluatepossible legal action, investigations are usually dropped due toforeign-relations considerations.Even lawmakers, who supposedly work for the public good, are involved in thearms trade. Many legislators own stock in armaments firms. Some are moreintimately involved, such as California state senator Leland Yee, who in 2014was indicted by a San Francisco grand jury for corruption and conspiracy totraffic in firearms. The irony of Yee’s plight was that the Democraticpolitician was an advocate of stricter gun control.Yet a rampant and corrupt American trade in arms is the least of our problems.Despite George Washington’s parting advice to beware foreign entanglements, theUnited States since World War II has followed a foreign policy ofinterventionism and adventurism that has only benefited the arms manufacturers.As of 2011, the U.S. had active military troops stationed in nearly 150 nations,including small countries such as Albania, Croatia, Estonia, and Ireland.Perpetual war allows globalists to continue funding dirty black-ops drugsmuggling, corrupt banking practices, political bribes, and assassinations.Perpetual war can be seen as an excuse for spying on Americans, militarizingpolice agencies, and laws allowing the federal government to declare anyAmerican citizen an “enemy combatant” and holding them without warrant or habeascorpus as well as spying with drones.With secretive societies, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, providingleadership for both the Democratic and Republican parties, there has been nosignificant change in U.S. foreign police since World War II. The global elitethat control both parties sees to it that no one who is not aligned withglobalist goals gains the presidency. No effort is spared to keep America inperpetual war, the basis for the elite’s global agenda.Investment in infrastructure would be a far better use of federal funds thaninvestment in the military. The nation’s highways, dams, and bridges continue todeteriorate, with many receiving failing grades from the American Society ofCivil Engineers (ASCE).In 2013, the ASCE, committed to protecting the health, safety, and welfare ofthe public by improving the nation’s public infrastructure, issued its “reportcard” grade based on physical condition and needed investments for improvement.The USA got a D-plus.Yet the proposed 2015 defense budget is more than $600 billion and protects along list of weapons programs. This budget also includes such items as $69million for a new prison facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, designed to house amere fifteen “high-value” prisoners, and a $2 billion NSA data center atBluffdale, Utah, to store Americans’ intercepted email, text, and phonemessages. With budgetary decisions such as these, it is apparent that the U.S.government values its position at the forefront of military technology more thanit values the lives of its citizens.PRIVATE GUN OWNERSHIPAMERICA’S INFATUATION WITH WEAPONRY IS PERHAPS BEST EXEMPLIFIED by how manyprivate citizens own guns. The U.S., despite having less than 5 percent of theworld’s population, has roughly 35 to 50 percent of the world’s civilian-ownedguns. Yet it’s not at all clear from the global statistics that private gunownership can be equated with violence. The countries with the third and fourthhighest rates of gun ownership may be unexpected: Switzerland and Finland, whichhave some of the lowest crime rates in the world. A similar link between gunownership and reduced crime can be found in FBI statistics, which showed onlyone gun-related homicide during 2012 in Alabama, a state lenient on firearms,versus 1,304 such deaths in California, a state with some of the strictest gunlaws.Chicago is another prime example of the ineffectiveness of gun control laws.Despite some of the most stringent antigun laws in the nation, Chicago led thenation in shootings in the first six months of 2014, with more than 1,100.During the July 4, 2014, weekend alone, there were 84 shootings and 14 homicidesin Chicago. Yet the corporate mass media failed to inform the public thatChicago, with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, routinelyhas more shooting deaths than other cities that recognize a citizen’s naturalright of self-defense by allowing them to freely and openly carry a personaldefense weapon.In recent years, school shootings have provided another talking point for bothsides of the gun control debate. Those in favor of more stringent gun controlcite the spate of recent shootings as evidence of our need for stricterrestrictions. Meanwhile, pro-gun groups argue that such shootings would decreaseif would-be shooters knew that every school contained a teacher, coach, orprincipal who was trained and armed.In years past, many students, particularly in the south and west, carried gunsto school, most often in the racks in pickup trucks for after-school hunting.According to former attorney general Eric Holder, the yearly average of massshootings in the U.S. tripled in recent years, from an average of five per yearbetween the years of 2000 and 2008 to twelve mass shootings just in 2013.Researchers at Harvard University in October 2014 reported that mass shootingincidents have increased threefold since 2011. They said on average a massshooting took place every sixty-four days during this period, compared with anaverage of every two hundred days in the years from 1982 to 2011.As will be demonstrated later, the true cause of the recent rise in massshootings is not weapons but the increase in psychiatric drugs being prescribedfor youngsters.The effectiveness of guns as a deterrent to crime has been proven in Kennesaw,Georgia, which in 1982 passed an ordinance requiring heads of households (withsome exceptions) to keep at least one firearm in their homes. By 2001, violentcrime rates in Kennesaw had dropped to about 85 percent below national and staterates while property crime dropped to about 50 percent below national and staterates. This decrease generally continued through 2012, with the exception ofsome slight increase between 2003 and 2008, accounted for by population growthtwice the national average. Though there are numerous other stories like the onein Kennesaw, the globalist-controlled mass media, with its antigun agenda,almost never reports them.In early 2013, thirty-three-year-old Deyfon Pipkin, who had a lengthy criminalrecord, was killed with a single shot by an elderly homeowner in Dallas afterbreaking into the man’s home. Pipkin’s family bemoaned the lack of a warningshot. “He could have used a warning,” Pipkin’s sister-in-law, Lakesha Thompson,complained to the media. “He could have let him know that he did have a gun onhis property and he would use it in self-defense.” Others wondered why Pipkin’sfamily had not warned him about the consequences of breaking into people’s homesto commit crimes.In April 2014, forty-year-old Mitchell Large, a man whom authorities said had alengthy criminal record for domestic violence and assault, was fatally shot bymembers of the Luis Peña family after he broke into their Winter Haven, Florida,home. Police Chief Gary Hester said the father, mother, and adult son all armedthemselves, and a warning shot was fired, but the intruder continued into thehouse. No charges were filed in the Peña case, and Hester told the media:“Whether [Large] was armed or not armed, when he failed to retreat theycertainly had a right . . . to defend themselves.”In America, the mere presence of firearms does not equate to increased homiciderates. But then statistics, reason, and common sense do not seem to apply whenit comes to the debate on ever-increasing gun control, a favored globalistagenda reaching all the way to the United Nations. In September 2014, Secretaryof State John Kerry signed the long-delayed UN Arms Trade Treaty, intended tocurb the international sales of weapons, prompting the National RifleAssociation’s Chris Cox to declare the treaty a “global gun grab treaty” and a“blatant attack on the constitutional rights and liberties of every law-abidingAmerican.”Lastly, the two principal reasons behind most gun violence—stress due to povertyintensified by alcohol consumption—are largely ignored by the corporate massmedia. This is because movements to address poverty do not pay for advertising,unlike the alcohol industry. Poverty and the unequal distribution of wealthcreate stress on even the most functional of families, especially incash-strapped cities such as Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis. The poorersections of major cities also experience more gun violence due to stressfulliving conditions.According to Robert Nash Parker in a paper entitled “The Effects of Context onAlcohol and Violence,” published in a 1993 issue of Alcohol Health & ResearchWorld, “Alcohol consumption increases violence within the context of poverty,and violent behavior may be perceived as a rational and acceptable choice insome contexts.”Yet the media never reports on these true causes of gun violence. It is clearthat the self-styled “globalists” who own and control the corporate mass mediahave a duplicitous agenda. While they profit from the international trade inarms, domestically their policy is very different: they seek to demonize guns toprecipitate a cry for more stringent laws and gun registration, to be followedby confiscation. After all, a disarmed population is more easily controlled.CHANGING THE GAMEIT IS CLEAR THAT THE PROBLEM OF GUN VIOLENCE HAS LESS TO DO with theavailability of weapons than with the hopelessness of poverty and thepolarization of wealth. Dorothy Stoneman is the founder of YouthBuild USA, aprogram in forty-six states offering low-income young people jobs while theywork toward a high school diploma. She explained, “If America spent as muchmoney offering opportunities to every sixteen- to twenty-six-year-old as wespend locking them up for minor offenses that further cut them off from apositive future, we could end poverty in a generation or two. When young peoplefind a true pathway to opportunity and a caring community, they become excellentparents determined to give their children the world of opportunities they lackedin their own childhood.”It is true that guns do not kill people; people kill people. Until we confrontand resolve sources of societal discontent, no antigun legislation will keep thepublic safe from lawless gun-toting criminals or the mentally unbalanced. Yetneither the corporate media nor self-serving politicians are interested inaddressing the basic problem of poverty. Politicians have always found it easierto simply pass more laws instead of probing the true causes of gun violence.No one should expect government to end arms production. Progress toward a morepeaceful and nonviolent society must begin at the local level. Alternativesshould be found for arms dealers. The manufacturers of war materials could shiftto producing more socially beneficial products. Yet even if the arms trade canbe brought under control, we will still face issues related to the second partof the GOD syndicate, and the second most profitable commodity in the world—oil.OILFOR MANY YEARS, SOME PETROLEUM EXPERTS HAVE CLAIMED THE world’s supply of oilhas peaked and is now in decline.A decline in oil availability would lead to higher energy prices and worldwideinstability. Should the supply of petrochemicals decline, new energy sourceswould need to emerge to fill the gap. We’ve reached a point where nations areaddicted to oil, in part because the most profitable business on the planet isarms, and all war machines run on petroleum, either as fuel or lubricants.But war machines are only a small part of the picture, as petroleum provides thefoundation for modern civilization. Computers and TVs are made from it, as areall plastics, food wrapping, shampoo, garbage bags, clothes softeners, somefurniture, most medicines, and even water bottles. These household necessitiesreach us by traveling the nation’s roadways via trucks, which are also fueled bypetroleum. Our economic system is so heavily dependent upon oil that if therewere to be a shortage, the price of virtually every good would rise. Andpetroleum consumption will only increase as the world’s population continues torise.PEAK OILTHE TERM “PEAK OIL” WAS COINED BY AMERICAN GEOPHYSICIST Marion King Hubbert, whoin 1956 predicted a peak in U.S. oil production by 1970 followed by steadydecline worldwide. Initially, many petroleum experts scoffed at the Hubbert PeakTheory, but today it is more respected, even though his specific projection hasproven false. While the year 2005, in which global production of oil indeeddeclined seventy-four million barrels per day, was cause for alarm, productionhas since recovered, setting new records in both 2011 and 2012.Some experts claim the only spare oil production capacity left in the world isin the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), composedprimarily of Middle Eastern nations. Peak oil advocates believe that non-OPECoil production limits have already been reached.“All the easy oil and gas in the world has pretty much been found. Now comes theharder work in finding and producing oil from more challenging environments andwork areas,” said William J. Cummings, a spokesman for ExxonMobil.Fear over peak oil has benefited those in the oil industry, who can consequentlycharge higher prices and justify further exploration for petroleum sources. Butthe foundations of the concept are weak. Cambridge Energy Research Associates(CERA), composed of energy expert consultants, has been critical of the theory.“Despite his valuable contribution, M. King Hubbert’s methodology falls downbecause it does not consider likely resource growth, application of newtechnology, basic commercial factors, or the impact of geopolitics onproduction. His approach does not work in all cases—including on the UnitedStates itself—and cannot reliably model a global production outlook. Put moresimply, the case for the imminent peak is flawed. As it is, production in 2005in the Lower 48 in the United States was 66 percent higher than Hubbertprojected,” stated a 2006 CERA report. The International Energy Association(IEA) also doubts the existence of peak oil, arguing that the global productionhas reached a plateau rather than a peak.Hubbert’s theory has allowed oil companies to profit from stoking public fear.Yet the remarkably effective new techniques being used to extract oil prove thatwe have nothing to worry about.THE BAKKEN FORMATIONTHE RECENT DISCOVERY OF THE BAKKEN ROCK FORMATION, WHICH underlies North Dakota,as well as parts of Montana, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, has made North Dakotathe number two oil-producing state in the U.S., behind only Texas. The Bakken isthe largest domestic oil discovery since Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, and has thepotential to eliminate all American dependence on foreign oil. The EnergyInformation Administration (EIA) estimates its potential at 503 billion barrels.Just 10 percent of this oil would be 50 billion barrels. If sold for $107 abarrel, this would mean a resource worth more than $5.3 trillion. This one fieldcould provide enough energy to last more than two thousand years even withincreased consumption.In view of this new oil source, there is increasing evidence that petroleumreserves are much greater than noted by the corporate mass media. The politicalramifications of this are staggering. After all, it is the specter of worldwideoil shortages that fuels the arguments of New World Order stalwarts who haveargued for both centralized government and private programs in the name ofconservation and environmentalism.One example is former presidential candidate Al Gore, who has been an advocateof global warming as well as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), styled as“North America’s only voluntary, legally binding greenhouse-gas reduction andtrading system.”This attempt to capitalize on carbon restrictions ended in November of 2010 whenCCX shut down its operations following the failure to win cap-and-tradelegislation in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.Despite the overabundance of oil, as exemplified by the Bakken formation, theoil industry continues to profit from fears over peak oil, while the search fornew energy resources continues with deadly effects.FRACKINGAN EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE THAT HAS GAINED CURRENCY IN recent years is fracking.The term, short for “hydraulic fracturing,” is the process of drilling andinjecting fluid (usually water along with chemicals) into the ground at a highpressure to fracture shale rocks, thereby releasing the natural gas inside. Eachfracking site requires between one and eight million gallons of water, mixedwith sand and about forty thousand chemicals, including toxic substances such aslead, uranium, mercury, ethylene glycol, radium, methanol, hydrochloric acid,and formaldehyde. More than half of these chemicals are nonbiodegradable andremain in the ground. Recovered fracking waste is left in open-air pits toevaporate. This releases volatile organic compounds, creating contaminated air,acid rain, and ground-level ozone. Metal ball bearings are added to frackingfluids to keep the fractures open indefinitely.These toxic chemicals leach out and contaminate nearby groundwater.Drinking-water wells near fracturing sites have been found to containconcentrations of methane seventeen times higher than normal.About 80 percent of the 155,000 wells in the United States involve the use ofwastewater to recover hydrocarbons through hydro-fracking, a technique initiallydeveloped by Halliburton. Significant evidence exists that corporate owners areusing fracking to destroy water wells and sicken the population in an effort tosell more pharmaceuticals while cornering the market on bottled water.More than a thousand incidents of water-well contamination have been documentednear fracking wells along with reports of sensory, respiratory, and neurologicaldamage due to those drinking the water. According to the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, residents in Arkansas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia,West Virginia, and Wyoming have reported health problems along with negativechanges in water quality and/or quantity following nearby fracturing operations.And fracking has also contributed to dangerous seismic activity. After aninjection well near Youngstown, Ohio, was linked to earthquakes there, GovernorJohn Kasich in 2012 issued an executive order requiring seismic studies beforethe state will issue well permits to operators. Yet despite the risks, no otherstate or the federal government requires any type of seismic risk assessment forinjection wells.Fracking alarmists have some statistics on their side. The average yearly rateof earthquakes above 3.0 on the Richter scale from 1967 to 2000 was a meretwenty-one, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). But as fracking grewmore common, this number jumped to about one hundred per year between 2010 and2012. Oklahoma recorded on average of fewer than six earthquakes a year between1975 and 2008. More than a hundred 3.0 quakes were recorded in the state in onlythe first four months of 2014. Thirty quakes were reported in just the first twomonths of 2015.On Tuesday, August 19, 2014, the Oklahoma Geology Survey (OGS) reported anunprecedented twenty earthquakes in Oklahoma on just that one day. “Nodocumented cases of induced seismicity have ever come close to the currentearthquake rates or the area over which the earthquakes are occurring,” reportedthe OGS. The OGS defines “induced seismicity” as minor earthquakes caused byhuman activity that might disrupt existing fault lines, whether by fracking,mass removal mining, reservoir impoundment, or geothermal production.A prime example of the dangers of fracking came when a magnitude 5.7earthquake—the largest ever recorded in the state—shook Prague, Oklahoma, inNovember 2011. It was preceded by a 4.7 foreshock and followed by a 4.7aftershock. The quake injured two persons, destroyed fourteen homes, and closedschools. Seismic activity from the quake was felt in seventeen states.Seismologists were initially puzzled. They felt the only possible culprit wasthe Wilzetta Fault, a 320-million-year-old rift lurking between Prague andnearby Meeker. Officials with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) foundits database indicated a zero possibility of ground motion from the fault. “Thisfault is like an extinct volcano. It should never have been active,” commentedKatie Keranen, an assistant professor of geophysics at the University ofOklahoma, who led a team placing some two dozen seismometers around the Praguearea. After a yearlong study that included scientists from the USGS and ColumbiaUniversity’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Keranen concluded, “Pretty mucheverybody who looks at our data accepts that these events were likely caused byinjection.” Oklahoma is not alone in experiencing a recent upsurge in seismicactivity. Unexpected quakes also occurred in Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio, andTexas.Many cities and states are now considering antifracking laws or zoningordinances. However, in politics, money talks. Despite support from two-thirdsof the state’s voters, the California Senate in May 2014 let die a bill thatwould have placed a moratorium on fracking in the state until scientific studiesevaluated all health and environmental effects for both onshore and offshoredrilling. The bill was defeated when four Democrats joined all twelveRepublicans senators in voting not to forward the bill. Three other Democratsabstained, preventing the moratorium from gaining a majority.The oil industry, led by the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), spentnearly $1.5 million in just the first three months of 2014 to lobby against thebill. The group Californians Against Fracking estimated that oil lobbyistsultimately spent a total of $15 million to defeat the bill.Big business and the oil lobby were elated at the bill’s defeat, while ZackMalitz with the antifracking group Credo Action, said, “The overwhelmingmajority of Californians who support a moratorium on fracking will not stopfighting fracking and the public health risks, earthquakes, and climate changelinked to this toxic extraction process.” Like California, the states ofPennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado have also allowed widespread fracking withoutevaluating its potential impact. The rise of fracking directly endangers thelivelihood of people living in many of those states, and is another effectivetool employed by the globalists to reduce population.CHANGING THE GAMETHE HISTORY OF PETROLEUM DEPENDENCE IS FILLED WITH UNETHICAL business practicesand death. Safer, more fuel-efficient cars such as the Tucker, Ford’s Edsel, andthe DeLorean were largely suppressed by those in power. The old Los Angeles “RedCar” electric trolley system was put out of business by the freeway systemsdesigned for petroleum-fueled vehicle traffic. The German inventor Rudolf Dieseloriginally designed his engine to run on organic matter, namely peanut oil. Buthe mysteriously died while crossing the English Channel in 1913, and todaydiesel engines run on various forms of distilled petroleum. Alternative fuels,derived from resources other than petroleum, include ethanol, produceddomestically from corn and other crops; biodiesel, made from vegetable oils andanimal fats; natural gas and propane, which produce less pollution; andhydrogen, which produces no pollution.Other countries have made smart investments in sustainable transportation. In2014, Japan celebrated fifty years of high-speed railroad, with trains travelingmore than 200 mph. China built five thousand miles of high-speed rail in onlysix years. In the U.S., there is just one single high-speed rail line betweenBoston and Washington D.C., with another planned for the year 2025. Apparently,someone wants us to drive on those interstate highways, using all the gasolinewe can afford.The wholesale practice of fracking without adequate—and independent—studies ofits impact on human health and water supplies is negligent and dangerous. Manystates today are questioning the use of fracking, and many other nations haveenacted moratoriums on fracking or even banned it outright. These countriesinclude Canada, France, Germany, South Africa, Argentina, Ireland, Switzerland,and the Czech Republic. An informed citizenry must demand a more stringentreview of fracking and its consequences to avoid future catastrophes fromearthquakes and despoiled water.Environmental degradation will continue until we invest in alternative energy.Thoughtful and concerted demands for safer and low-pollution technologies mustincrease until we can break the stranglehold the oil and gas industry holds overpublic policy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-7]DRUGS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-7]DESPITE DRACONIAN ANTIDRUG LAWS AND HARSH SENTENCES FOR drug offenders, the drugproblem has only worsened over the years.According to the United Nations’ “Drug Report 2012,” the citizens of the UnitedStates take more drugs, both legal and illegal, than almost any other nation.And a recent World Health Organization (WHO) survey of legal and illegal druguse in seventeen countries showed Americans are the world’s largest consumers ofillegal drugs, particularly cocaine and marijuana. Americans were four timesmore likely to report using cocaine in their lifetime (16 percent) than thenext-closest country, New Zealand (4 percent). The U.S. also reported thehighest rate of marijuana use (42.4 percent).The survey found that persons with higher incomes were also more likely to useboth legal and illegal drugs. “The use of drugs seems to be a feature of moreaffluent countries,” the survey noted. “The U.S., which has been driving much ofthe world’s drug research and drug policy agenda, stands out with higher levelsof use of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis, despite punitive illegal drugpolicies, as well as (in many U.S. states) a higher minimum legal alcoholdrinking age than many comparable developed countries.”Just as both politicians and the public had to rethink Prohibition in the early1930s, many nations today are beginning to reconsider the so-called War onDrugs, a war now commonly acknowledged as lost.According to a 2014 report by five Nobel Prize–winning economists, the battle tocreate a drug-free world is “misguided and counterproductive.” Entitled “Endingthe Drug Wars,” the study was produced by the London School of Economics’ IDEAScenter, and posits that a fundamental restructuring of national andinternational policies and strategies is required.“The [current] strategy has failed based on its own terms. Evidence shows thatdrug prices have been declining while purity has been increasing. This has beendespite drastic increases in global enforcement spending. Continuing to spendvast resources on punitive enforcement-led policies, generally at the expense ofproven public health policies, can no longer be justified,” argued theeighty-two-page report.According to this report, “The pursuit of a militarized and enforcement-ledglobal ‘war on drugs’ strategy has produced enormous negative outcomes andcollateral damage. These include mass incarceration in the U.S., highlyrepressive policies in Asia, vast corruption and political destabilization inAfghanistan and West Africa, immense violence in Latin America, an HIV epidemicin Russia, an acute global shortage of pain medication and the propagation ofsystematic human rights abuses around the world.” It concludes, “It is time toend the ‘War on Drugs’ and massively redirect resources towards effectiveevidence-based policies underpinned by rigorous economic analysis.”Decrying a “one-size-fits-all” approach to combating illicit drugs, the authorsof the report said the United Nations should take the lead in creating a “newcooperative international framework based on the fundamental acceptance thatdifferent policies will work for different countries and regions.” Such a newdrug policy should be “based on principles of public health, harm reduction,illicit market impact reduction, expanded access to essential medicines,minimization of problematic consumption, rigorously monitored regulatoryexperimentation and an unwavering commitment to principles of human rights.”The International Drug Policy Project coordinator for the IDEAS center, JohnCollins, commented, “The drug war’s failure has been recognized by public healthprofessionals, security experts, human rights authorities and now some of theworld’s most respected economists. Leaders need to recognize that toeing theline on current drug control strategies comes with extraordinary human andfinancial costs to their citizens and economies.”Interestingly enough, it is not illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine thathave proven most fatal to citizens of the death culture.As much as a third of the population—one hundred million Americans—take powerfuland even toxic mood-altering legal drugs just to get through the day. It isparticularly scary to note that, according to some studies, some forty millionof these drugged persons admit to driving on public thoroughfares while underthe influence.Pharmaceutical companies’ profits have skyrocketed since the 1980s. From 1960 to1980, prescription drug sales were fairly static as a percentage of U.S. grossdomestic product, but between 1980 and 2000, they tripled. By 2012, prescriptiondrug spending was estimated to account for $260.8 billion of national healthspending.The success of Big Pharma has more to do with marketing than with the efficiencyof its drugs. Attempts by the large drug corporations to convince healthy peoplethat they are sick and need drugs is called disease-mongering. To increasesales, Big Pharma invents new diseases, such as female sexual dysfunctionsyndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, toenail fungus, male baldness, andsocial anxiety disorder (formerly known as shyness). These are but a few of thenormal or mild conditions that have been represented as diseases requiringmedication.In a 2014 article in Whistleblower magazine, editor David Kupelian foresawwidespread and increasing drug use was bringing America a “real zombieapocalypse.” Kupelian noted, “It turns out, whether we’re caught up in the hugeillegal drug world or the equally huge legal drug world—either way, tens ofmillions of us are taking basically the same drugs to deal with basically thesame problems, and we’re headed for basically the same dead end.” He added,“Though psychiatry is supposed to be helping us, it has lost its way and becomethe most drug-dependent of all.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-9]DEADLY MEDICINE [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-9]IN 2000, THE Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) shocked themedical profession by revealing that the third leading cause of death for allAmericans was doctor-related. A study published in the July 26, 2000, edition ofJAMA by Dr. Barbara Starfield indicated that as many as 225,000 deaths per yearare the result of conventional medical care. And some researchers say this is aconservative estimate; the real total may be closer to one million preventabledeaths yearly. In either case, this makes the American medical system the thirdleading cause of death in the U.S., right behind heart disease and cancer.Starfield, who died in 2011, was a much-honored pediatrician and cofounder ofthe International Society for Equity in Health. In her 2000 report, entitled “IsU.S. Health Really the Best in the World?,” Starfield revealed that there were12,000 yearly deaths from unnecessary surgeries, 7,000 deaths from medicationerrors in hospitals, 20,000 deaths from other errors in hospitals, and 80,000deaths from infections acquired in hospitals. Another 106,000 deaths wereattributed to FDA-approved and correctly prescribed medicines. This number doesnot include illegal drugs or the “inappropriate use” of legal prescriptiondrugs.Starfield, in a 2009 interview, declared, contrary to what most people think,that the U.S. does not have the best health in the world. “The American publicappears to have been hoodwinked into believing that more interventions lead tobetter health,” she said.According to Starfield, most have never heard of deadly diseases such ascarbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), which the World HealthOrganization (WHO) has labeled “one of the three greatest threats to humanhealth.” Today, this new, highly contagious, drug-resistant bacteria has afatality rate as high as 50 percent and is being seen more and more often inlong-term facilities rather than large hospitals, according to the CDC.And we’re helping to create these killer germs. CRE has become more prevalent asa result of doctors’ overprescribing antibiotics using narrowly targetedchemical medications that lack the holistic benefits found in natural remedies.Such restrictive use encourages bacteria to develop molecular defenses,resulting in increased resistance to antibiotics. “The situation is so bad todaythat the entire pharmaceutical industry has no drug, no chemicals and noexperimental medicines which can kill CRE superbugs,” noted Natural News editorMike Adams, adding, “Drug companies have discovered that it’s far moreprofitable to sell ‘lifestyle management’ drugs like statin drugs and bloodpressure drugs than to sell antibiotics which treat acute infections.Antibiotics simply aren’t very profitable because relatively few people acquiresuch infections. Meanwhile, everyone can be convinced they might have highcholesterol and therefore need to take a statin drug for life.” Were a superbuglike CRE to gain widespread traction, America would be defenseless to stop itsspread.While natural health advocates recognize the value of allopathic drug treatmentin certain cases, they argue that natural remedies along with proper diet andexercise can often aid the normal person in maintaining health.Natural health advocate Dr. Joseph Mercola pointed out that Japan has benefitedfrom the understanding that modern technology is wonderful, but just because itcan be used to diagnose illnesses does not mean one should be committed toundergoing traditional treatment. Mercola noted that Japan’s health statisticsreflect that loving care is often more effective than treatment. Drugs, surgery,and hospitals are less effective than simple improvements in diet, exercise, andlifestyle.There is no logical reason—apart from the profits enjoyed by the elites at thehead of pharmaceutical companies—why our health care system should focusexclusively on these allopathic “cures.” Some consider the greatest healthconspiracy of all time to be the institutionalized effort to prevent the publicfrom realizing that humans are born with all the programming they need to createperfect health and can often heal themselves of deadly diseases.What’s more, federal agencies have a woeful track record of protecting thepublic from highly dangerous drugs. Starfield explains: “Even though there willalways be adverse events that cannot be anticipated, the fact is that more andmore unsafe drugs are being approved for use. Many people attribute that to thefact that the pharmaceutical industry is (for the past ten years or so) requiredto pay the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] for reviews—which puts the FDAinto an untenable position of working for the industry it is regulating.” Thedeath statistics Starfield reports are evidence of the broken U.S. health careindustry. And the powerful forces behind it are unwilling to relinquish theirgrip on U.S. health policy. Insurance companies, specialty- and disease-orientedmedical academia, and the pharmaceutical- and device-manufacturing industriesall contribute heavily to congressional campaigns, often lobbying for policiesnot in the public’s best interest.This cozy relationship between the FDA, pharmaceutical companies, and Congressallows these deadly medicines to make their way onto the market. Even drugsthought to be safe can prove deadly, including over-the-counter remedies such asibuprofen and acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, one of thenation’s most popular pain relievers. Even small overdosing of acetaminophen hasbeen shown to cause long-term liver damage and in rare cases can cause stomachbleeding and even death. According to the CDC, about 150 Americans each year diefrom accidental acetaminophen overdoses.The FDA and the makers of acetaminophen such as Johnson & Johnson’s Tylenol arewell aware of risks associated with the drug, as indicated on the warninglabels, but the FDA has yet to finalize rules governing its safe use. The FDAsafety review of acetaminophen began in the 1970s, but by 2013, it was stillincomplete because of foot-dragging within the agency. FDA records show theagency repeatedly defers consumer protection decisions even when they areendorsed by the agency’s own advisory committees.Although Johnson & Johnson has moved toward making Tylenol more safe, separatelydeveloping an antidote to acetaminophen poisoning, internal corporate documentsobtained by the watchdog organization ProPublica show that for more than threedecades the company has fought against safety warnings, dosage restrictions, andother measures designed to make the product safer.FDA officials admit the agency has moved sluggishly to address the mounting tollof liver damage and deaths attributed to acetaminophen. Dr. Sandy Kweder withthe FDA said, “Among over-the-counter medicines, it’s among our top priorities.It just takes time.” Informed consumers wonder if forty years is not enough.Some deadly drugs are not only dangerous to your health but also tough on yourpocketbook. Ever wonder why the costs of prescription drugs in the United Statesare the highest in the world or why it’s illegal to import similar, cheaperdrugs from Canada or Mexico?This situation can be traced back to a Medicare prescription drug programpharmaceutical companies lobbied for the passage of in 2003. The MedicarePrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, the largest overhaul ofMedicare in its history to that date, extended limited prescription drugcoverage under Medicare to forty-one million Americans, including thirteenmillion who had never before been covered, with an estimated cost of $400billion.Lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies, which spend roughly $100 million a yearin campaign contributions and lobbying expenses, were present throughout thedevelopment of the bill, in fact, outnumbered Congress members two to one. Thelegislation, one of the most expensive bills ever placed before the House, waspassed in an unorthodox roll-call vote in the middle of the night.“The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill,” recalled North CarolinaRepublican Walter Jones. “The bill was over a thousand pages. And it got to themembers of the House that morning, and we voted for it at about 3:00 a.m. I’vebeen in politics for 22 years, and it was the ugliest night I have ever seen in22 years.” Critics claim the law provided billions of dollars in subsidies toinsurance companies, giant pharmaceutical corporations, and health maintenanceorganizations, and took the first step toward allowing private plans to competewith Medicare.Many of the most expensive drugs are used in the fight against cancer, thesecond leading cause of death in America. As the baby boomer generation reachesretirement age, medical expenditures for cancer research and treatment isexpected to top $158 billion (in 2010 dollars) by the year 2020, according tothe National Institutes of Health (NIH).Chemotherapy, the use of chemical drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancerouscells, is responsible for many of the health care costs associated with cancer.Chemotherapy is a nasty procedure, which also kills normal cells, resulting ininflammation of the digestive tract, hair loss, and decreased production ofblood cells, which suppresses the immune system.One 2012 study found chemotherapy may actually cause more cancer than it cures.Chemo damages the DNA of healthy, noncancerous cells, triggering them to producemolecules that in turn produce more cancer cells. Researchers at the FredHutchison Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that chemotherapy damageshealthy tissue surrounding tumors, causing cancer cells to develop resistance tothe treatment. They transform into “super” cancer cells that resistchemotherapy, much as superbugs like CRE resist antibiotics, making the cancereven more deadly.Typical of the growing hostility toward chemotherapy was this statement fromDave Mihalovic, a “naturopathic doctor” writing in Waking Times: “Ninety-sevenpercent of the time, chemotherapy does not work and continues to be used onlyfor one reason—doctors and pharmaceutical companies make money from it. That’sthe only reason chemotherapy is still used.” Mihalovic and other critics claimthat chemotherapy, in actuality, boosts cancer growth and long-term mortalityrates by destroying the immune system, increasing neurocognitive decline,disrupting endocrine functioning, and causing organ and metabolic toxicities.Patients basically live in a permanent state of disease until their death.A twelve-year meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology showsthat 97 percent of the time chemotherapy is ineffective in regressing metastaticcancers. One wonders where the money raised for cancer is actually going:certainly not to nutritional or homeopathic research, which are likely to bemore effective than chemo has been. As Peter Glidden, a nutritional doctor andauthor of The MD Emperor Has No Clothes, remarks, “If Ford Motor Company made anautomobile that exploded 97 percent of the time, would they still be inbusiness? No.” Yet the influence of pharmaceutical companies keeps the presentbroken system in place, despite its obvious failures.If there were the money and political will to explore other treatment options,many seem to hold promise. Dr. Cristina Sanchez of Complutense University ofMadrid has found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemicalfound in marijuana, kills cancer cells without damaging healthy cells. Herresearch, along with studies at the University of London’s St. George’s MedicalSchool, show that THC has “potent anti-cancer activity,” and can significantly“target and switch off” pathways that allow cancers to grow.As of this writing, marijuana continues to be outlawed, even for research, as aSchedule I narcotic by the U.S. federal government, along with morphine, LSD,heroin, and opium. Could the cancer-killing properties of marijuana explain whythe federal government continues to ban it?One early cancer researcher who spelled out a cure was Nobel laureatephysiologist Otto Warburg. Prior to World War II, Warburg gave a lecturedescribing both the cause and cure for cancer. “Summarized in a few words, theprime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normalbody cells by a fermentation of sugar. All normal body cells meet their energyneeds by respiration of oxygen, whereas cancer cells meet their energy needs ingreat part by fermentation. All normal body cells are thus obligate aerobes,whereas all cancer cells are partial anaerobes . . . Oxygen gas, the donor ofenergy in plants and animals is dethroned in the cancer cells and replaced by anenergy yielding reaction of the lowest living forms, namely, a fermentation ofglucose,” he announced, adding, “On the basis of anaerobiosis there is now areal chance to get rid of this terrible disease.”In other words, while most living cells require oxygen to live, cancer cells dowell without oxygen, instead drawing energy from the fermentation of sugars.Cancer cells cannot survive in an oxygenated alkaline system. Furthermore,humans require a minimum of 22 percent oxygen in the air they breathe tomaintain normal health. Most American cities are regularly below this minimum,and on so-called ozone alert days, the oxygen percentage often drops to 18percent, well below the level necessary for good health.The amount of sugar in the American diet is well documented, with obesityquickly becoming a national health crisis. If Dr. Warburg’s appraisal iscorrect, it is astounding that nothing has been done to cure cancer in theintervening eight decades since his lecture. Despite this knowledge, the averageAmerican’s diet today remains the most acidic (sugar-based) in the world.Perhaps this is because, as suspicious researchers have observed, more peopleare making a living off cancer than dying from it.Though anticancer drugs are the most profitable subindustry for pharmaceuticalcompanies, other drugs as well have generated huge profits while actively doingharm to those who take them. The anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx is one suchexample. Before finally being withdrawn from the market in 2004, Vioxx wasbelieved to have caused more than sixty thousand deaths. Merck, the producer ofthe drug, is the second largest pharmaceutical corporation in the U.S., andprofited tremendously from Vioxx, which earned $2.5 billion in sales in 2003alone. When the drug was pulled due in large part to evidence that itcontributed to fatal heart attacks and strokes, analysts anticipated that thejudgment against Merck could run up to $25 billion. Yet the plea bargain reachedin 2012 resulted in a fine of only $321 million, a mere blip on Merck’s bottomline.Equally worrisome was the accusation that Merck‘s clinical study reports weredeveloped by Merck but ultimately published under the names of reputable doctorsand scientists. Dr. Joseph S. Ross, of New York’s Mount Sinai School ofMedicine, found these apparently ghostwritten research studies while reviewingcase documents in the lawsuits against the company. Faced with irrefutableevidence, Merck admitted hiring outside professional writers to developresearch-related documents, including for its $500 million Vioxx marketingcampaign. With clinical studies on the drug being written by people on thecompany payroll, it’s no wonder that the dangerous effects of the drug were notdiscovered until it was too late.The Vioxx case highlights a broader issue with pharmaceutical advertising. Withthe introduction of direct-to-consumer drug advertising in the 1990s, the numberof Americans on prescription drugs for life has ballooned, with the number ofadults and children on one or more prescription medications rising by more thantwelve million between 2001 and 2007. And the goal is no longer to get off thesedrugs, as with an antibiotic, but rather to continue taking them in perpetuity.Health reporter Martha Rosenberg points out that Big Pharma hooks the U.S.public on prescriptions for life. Prescriptions once used only as needed forpain, anxiety, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux), asthma, mood problems, migrainesand even erectile dysfunction, gout and retroviruses are now “full-time”medicines. “Instead of having body pain to be treated transiently, you are puton an antidepressant like Cymbalta or seizure drug like Lyrica or Neurontinindefinitely,” she said.Arianna Huffington, president and editor in chief of the Huffington Post MediaGroup, asked, “So why don’t things ever change, even as the [legal drug] deathtoll mounts? As always, the answer can be found by following the money. The bigpharmaceutical companies continue to be the 800-pound gorillas of Americanpolitics, their power stemming from a muscular combination of lobbying ($150million a year), campaign contributions (close to $50 million doled out tofederal candidates over the past four years), and powerful friends in very highplaces (Donald Rumsfeld was formerly CEO of drug industry powerhouse G. D.Searle; and Mitch Daniels, the former White House budget director and newgovernor-elect of Indiana, was a senior vice president at Eli Lilly.) . . . Ofcourse, the real shame is that we continue to have a regulatory system in whichcorporate greed, political timidity and a culture of cronyism have rendered thepublic good a quaint afterthought.”Even scarier than the drugs we have now are the ones that may be to come.Scientists in the U.S. and other countries are creating new and previouslyunknown viruses that could wipe out whole populations. A report issued in May2014 by epidemiologists Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health andAlison Galvani of Yale, noted labs around the world are creating and alteringviruses to understand how natural strains might evolve into more lethal forms.These researchers have warned that the benefits of such experiments might beoutweighed by the risk of pathogenic strains escaping from laboratories andspreading.The U.S. government, which funds many of these controversial experiments,instituted new rules that fund such work provided the potential benefits aredeemed substantial and the risks considered manageable. Lipsitch argues there isno evidence that the risks and benefits have been weighed properly. “To myknowledge, no such thing has been done, but funding for these experimentscontinues,” he said. Many people fear such experimentation might lead to apandemic, or fall into the hands of bioterrorists. Both the government andfunding organizations should employ unbiased experts to assess which viralstudies to support, yet this is not happening. With the recent spread ofinfectious diseases such as Ebola, this issue has been thrust into the publicconsciousness, and it’s clear the U.S. government lacks a comprehensive systemto determine which activities are safe and which are not."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-11]DEADLY VACCINES [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-11]IN THE EARLY 1950S, U.S. CHILDREN TYPICALLY RECEIVED THIRTEEN doses of fourvaccines—for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and smallpox—but not more thanthree doses in a single visit. By the mid-1980s, four more vaccines were added:measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and polio. Today, the number of vaccinesrecommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is higher than in anycountry in the world. The CDC recommends children receive as many asthirty-seven doses of fourteen vaccines by the age of two and forty-eight dosesof fourteen vaccines by age six, with sometimes as many as eight vaccine shotsin a single visit. Critics point out that overvaccination, and the infusion intovaccines of additives such as fluoride, have had disastrous results forchildren. The battle lines of the vaccine debate are clear: independent doctorsand researchers have lined up against government regulators and thepharmaceutical industry.Another critic is Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, a board-certified pediatrician trainedat the New York School of Medicine. He explained his transition from vaccinebeliever to vaccine skeptic: “When I went through medical school, I was taughtthat vaccines were completely safe and completely effective, and I had no reasonto believe otherwise. All the information that I was taught was pretty standardin all the medical schools and the teachings and scientific literaturethroughout the country. I had no reason to disbelieve it . . . But more andmore, I kept seeing that my experience of the world, my experience in using andreading about vaccines, and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines werevery different from what I was taught in medical school and my residencytraining.”Palevsky, along with other physicians, has become concerned that vaccines havenot been completely proven safe or even completely effective, based on theliterature now available.Yet many doctors remain unwilling to consider the possibility that somethingmight be wrong with vaccines. “Most pediatricians are indoctrinated to simplytell parents that anything related to a bad outcome from a vaccine is a merecoincidence. But how come there are so many of these coincidences?” Palevskywonders. “It is heartbreaking, because I see many of these kids who weredevelopmentally normal, who were doing well, who were speaking, then whosevoices and eye contacts were lost, who went into seizures, who developed asthmaand allergies, and they had nowhere to go because their doctors told them thatthey don’t know what they’re talking about. These kids are real.”Palevsky argues that proper vaccine studies have not been conducted and thatmedical literature is “pretty supportive of the fact” that vaccines have “muchgreater adverse outcomes on the genotype of the body, the immune system of thebody, the brain of the body, and the intracellular functions of the body than weare willing to tell the public about.”Despite proponents’ claims that more than twenty thousand studies have proventhe safety of vaccines, a closer look reveals otherwise. Before such studies canbe uncritically accepted, it should be asked how the study was designed and bywhom. Were there any control groups? What was the size of the study’s populationand were they kids or adults? “I think we will see that in most of thosestudies, the actual safety has never really been proven,” opined Palevsky.Proponents of vaccines also argue that unvaccinated people benefit from the factthat most children are vaccinated. This is called herd immunity: the idea isthat the more people that are vaccinated, the less likely it is that anyone inthat community will become infected.This has been cast into serious doubt by members of the medical community. Dr.Palevsky and others believe it is preposterous to think that children who arevaccinated no longer carry the bacteria or the viruses for which they have beeninoculated. If, in fact, children are vaccinated, then why should parents andpublic health authorities be afraid that nonvaccinated children are somehowcarrying something that their children are not. “You can’t have it both ways,”argued Dr. Palevsky. “You can’t vaccinate believing that your children areprotected and then feel that your children are not protected because somehow,some non-vaccinated child is carrying some secret organism that no one else iscarrying. It just doesn’t make any sense.”Others agree. Dr. Russell Blaylock writes, “That vaccine-induced herd immunityis mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we weretaught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinkingexisted for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it wasdiscovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 yearsafter being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that isthe baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of thesediseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life.”In essence, this would mean at least 50 percent or more of the population losttheir immune protection within two to ten years of being vaccinated, thus, mostof the population today goes without the 95 percent number claimed needed forherd immunity.Most medical authorities agree that the vaccine question does not lend itself tosimple yes or no answers. Should parents forbid any vaccination whatsoever orallow whatever their doctor prescribes? More and more Americans are decidingthat such questions should be left up to the individual parent. Proponents ofinformed consent contend that families who have done their homework should beable to make their own choices. “When parents are given both sides, it is up tothem to make that informed choice,” advised Dr. Palevsky.What is clear, however, from the history of vaccination is that there are veryreal risks associated with the practice. In 1998, three vaccine manufacturersfaced lawsuits in the UK after parents there reported more than 1,500 instancesof side effects following the administration of measles, mumps, and rubella(MMR) vaccines. Despite assurances from British health officials that there wasno connection between the reported symptoms and the vaccines, cases were set fortrial in the High Court to decide whether the vaccines caused symptoms of autismand bowel problems. The cases were funded under the English legal aid system andsupported by twenty-seven experts who prepared reports supporting the children’scases. The parents believed their children were normal before being vaccinated,and saw nothing but the vaccinations to account for the subsequent changes. Thecases stalled and have not proceeded after legal aid was withdrawn in August2003, leaving the question of vaccine culpability unresolved.While supporters claim vaccinations are necessary for good health, an articlepublished in Pediatrics Journal refuted this claim. It described how themajority of infectious diseases were reduced prior to World War II thanks togreater health care and nutrition, better sanitation and improved livingconditions. This was long before the widespread use of antibiotics andvaccinations.“During the past 30 years, the number of vaccinations our children receive hastripled, and during that same period of time, the number of children withlearning disabilities, ADHD, asthma and diabetes has also more than tripled!”noted Dr. Joseph Mercola. “It’s astounding how effective drug companies are atmanipulating national health policy. They have been able to manipulate andpervert the public health system so they now can sell toxic, ineffective flushots in pharmacies, airports, college campuses, grocery stores, and countlessother outlets, without any [emphasis in the original] solid evidence that theflu shots even work, and despite the many questionable ingredients found in theshots.”Such ingredients include thimerosal, known to be very toxic by inhalation,ingestion, and contact with skin yet still included in multidose flu vaccinedespite a legitimate public outcry. Other questionable vaccine ingredientsinclude formaldehyde or formalin, chicken kidney cells and DNA, monosodiumglutamate, Octoxynol-9 (Triton X-100), used in spermicides, and polysorbate 80,an emulsifier found to cause an anaphylactic reaction in a German patient.Furthermore, many vaccines are making recipients vulnerable to new and dangerousdiseases. In 2014, a severe respiratory virus known as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)infected more than 150 children in the midwest. By the fall, victims, many ofwhom required intensive care, were reported as far north as Canada. Dr. MaryAnne Jackson, division director of infectious diseases at Children’s MercyHospital in Kansas City, Missouri, said, “It’s worse in terms of scope ofcritically ill children who require intensive care. I would call itunprecedented. I’ve practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I’ve never seenanything quite like this.” The only common denominator of those infected withD68 was that all had been vaccinated for MMR, influenza, and polio, indicatingthis could be an unintended side effect.Yet despite the inherent risk posed by vaccines, they are often used as apolitical tool to capitalize on public fear. The threat posed by a number ofpandemics in recent years is evidence of this. Although CDC predictions as tothe scope and danger of a pandemic are frequently inaccurate, the governmentstill uses these predictions to push an agenda of increased vaccinations ontothe citizenry. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC in2009 predicted a pandemic of swine flu, a combination of human influenzaviruses, avian (bird) flu, and swine flu strains. The WHO and the CDC, inpredicting a serious swine flu epidemic warned that compulsory inoculationsmight be necessary.At the time, there were indeed reports of employees losing their jobs if theyrefused to be vaccinated. One nurse fought back and won . . . after four years.June Valent, a nurse at Hackettstown Community Hospital in New Jersey, was firedfor refusing the flu shot. The hospital required employees to take the fluvaccine unless they had a medical or religious excuse, and anyone who refusedwas required to wear a mask. Valent agreed to wear a mask but declined the shot.As a result, she was fired and disqualified for unemployment benefits. She fileda lawsuit and in 2014 a court agreed that that the hospital violated Valent’sright to freedom of expression by accepting a religious-based exemption whiledenying her secular one.Given the ultimately limited reach of the outbreak, and the number of people whowere vaccinated, it’s fair to wonder whether pharmaceutical corporations mayhave manipulated the WHO in an effort to sell swine flu vaccine. These companieshad invested millions of dollars researching and developing pandemic vaccinesfollowing the bird flu scares of 2006 and 2007; without a pandemic, either realor manufactured, this money would have gone to waste. Whether these corporationsand the WHO deliberately misled the public or not, they clearly overstated thepotential dangers of the flu strain. As Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, the president ofthe Health Committee of the Council of Europe, puts it, the pharmaceutical lobbyand world governments engaged in a “great campaign of panic” centered on theswine flu.Such suspicions gain currency when paired with incidents like the following: inSeptember 2014, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)revealed that the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline had released more thaneleven gallons of concentrated live polio virus into rivers near Rixen, Belgium.The release, termed accidental, if in fact purposeful, would demonstrate areliable way to ensure that the polio vaccine continues to be in high demand.Pharmaceutical companies also benefit from the interactions between multipledifferent vaccines. A 2009 Canadian study indicated people under the age offifty are at a higher risk of being infected with the swine flu virus afterreceiving the annual flu shot. Lead authors Danuta Skowronski of the BritishColumbia Centre for Disease Control and Gaston De Serres of Laval University,found consistency across four epidemiologic studies and one animal experimentthat suggested “an association that cannot be dismissed on the basis of chanceand is unlikely to be explained entirely by bias.” Canadian authoritiesexpressed concern the results of this study might throw inoculation programsinto disarray with fewer people volunteering for shots.And when one fake pandemic fizzles out, the government-pharmaceutical complexsimply moves on to the next. When fears over swine flu waned, the media begantouting a new pandemic known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whichwas first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and then spread westward. Bymid-2014, at least two cases of MERS were reported in the U.S., both in personswho had traveled there from Saudi Arabia. Although the CDC warned that MERScarries a 30 percent death rate for sufferers, officials said the viralrespiratory disease is contracted only through close contact and was not likelyto spread widely.When they’re not playing up fears of certain diseases in order to inject us withdeadly vaccines, the pharmaceutical establishment is downplaying the risks posedby legitimately deadly diseases. In 2014, of course, the hottestdisease-promoting fear of depopulation was the Ebola virus, spreading rapidly inseveral West African countries. The arrival in the U.S. of the first American tocontract Ebola, Dr. Kent Brantly, prompted fears of a pandemic, with manyquestioning the wisdom of intentionally bringing Ebola victims to the U.S. TheEbola virus was spreading faster than it could be controlled and had thepotential to be “catastrophic” in terms of lost lives, warned Margaret Chan,head of the World Health Organization (WHO). So why then were victims beingbrought to the United States?The immediate response by African governments was equally incoherent. In theearly fall of 2014, the West African nation of Sierra Leone, situated betweenLiberia and Guinea, was placed under medical martial law, with its six millioncitizens quarantined in their homes for three days as government workers wentdoor to door seeking Ebola victims.Similarly, in Liberia, the government and the World Health Organization wereestablishing about seventy “community care centers” to involuntarily move thoseinfected with Ebola from their homes. A similar program was planned for SierraLeone. Some observers have called these controversial centers “Ebola deathcamps.” At least three thousand U.S. soldiers were ordered to aid the lockdownand displacement, causing some Americans to suspect the African action might bea preview of things to come in the U.S. should the Ebola outbreak spread here.Oddly enough, at least some of these troops were assigned hospice dutiesrequiring close contact with the infected, such as cleaning rooms and emptyingbedpans.By the end of September 2014, the first Ebola case in the USA was made public bythe CDC. The critically ill patient, who was not initially named, enteredPresbyterian Hospital in Dallas after arriving in the U.S. from Liberia to visitrelatives. CDC Director Thomas Frieden appeared optimistic when he announced,“This is the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. and the first strain ofthis Ebola diagnosed outside of Africa. I have no doubt that we will controlthis case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country.”Yet it appeared the federal government was gearing up for an Ebola pandemicfollowing the activities in Africa when in September 2014 President Obama warnedthat the Ebola outbreak was “spiraling out of control” and that the world mightsee “hundreds of thousands of people infected” if it was not swiftly addressedby the international community. Meanwhile, Lakeland Industries, a manufacturerof protective clothing, announced the U.S. State Department had put out a bidfor 160,000 hazmat suits for the battle against Ebola.Thus far, the early indications of what the Obama administration response toEbola may be are troubling. Soon after the outbreak, Obama signed an executiveorder authorizing the apprehension, detention, or conditional release ofindividuals with certain severe acute respiratory diseases, not includinginfluenza. This order modified a similar one signed by George Bush in 2003 inresponse to public fear over the SARS epidemic.This order could be used to forcibly quarantine persons merely suspected ofcarrying the Ebola virus. The CDC acknowledged that twenty quarantine centers,scattered across the country, had been activated to accept patients. Thecontradiction between the government’s avowed actions to protect the countryfrom Ebola and the Obama administration’s lenient immigration policy, which hasallowed a flood of illegals carrying any number of diseases across the nation’ssouthern border, has been noted by many.Kurt Nimmo, writing for Prison Planet.com, also noted this contradiction andclaimed, “Disease, natural disaster, and man-made crises are routinely exploitedby government as pretexts to enlarge and extend its power and reach. The stateand its propaganda media thrive on one manufactured crisis after another as partof a systematic effort to ramp up the police state.”The apparent goal is not protection of the people but the creation of anall-encompassing surveillance state along with a militarized component designedto control the population through fear and violence. By April 2015, at leasthalf of the American troops sent to Africa had returned and the Ebola outbreakappeared to have waned, but only after almost 10,000 deaths.Ebola is difficult to contract, as it is primarily passed only by direct contactwith blood and other bodily fluids from an infected person. Yet seizing onirrational public fear, the government has been successful in imposing newrestrictions on citizens. In addition to providing an excuse for an enlargementof government and military power, hyped-up pandemic threats are used bytransnational corporations to increase profits. The fearmongering over Ebola issimply the same swine flu drama played out on a grander stage.Then there is the question of why the U.S. government has claimed ownership ofall Ebola viruses that share more than 70 percent similarity with an Ebolastrain that was patented in 2010 (patent No. CA2741523A1). One of the listedpatent’s applicants was “The Government of The United States of America asrepresented by the Secretary, Department Of Health & Human Services, Center ForDisease Control.”With all of these created pandemics, we must ask what the ultimate end goalmight be. In this case the answer is clear: they are key components of theglobalist agenda of population reduction. The scientific community has longsuggested the Ebola virus could be an effective tool toward this end. In 2006,Eric Pianka, a professor of biology at the University of Texas, was reported tohave advocated severe population reduction by means of a virus such as Ebola.Pianka has since disputed the reports and clarified that he does “not bear anyill will toward people,” but at least one first-hand account has confirmed thestory. Forrest Mims, writing in the Citizen Scientist, noted, “I watched inamazement as a few hundred members of the Texas Academy of Science rose to theirfeet and gave a standing ovation to a speech that enthusiastically advocated theelimination of 90 percent of Earth’s population by airborne Ebola.”The text of Pianka’s speech is chilling. He spoke of a future with a drasticallyreduced population, noting that, “After the human population collapses, there’sgoing to be a lot fewer of us. Food’s going to be diminished. Pollution’s goingto go down, which will be good,” Pianka said. He also suggested that the entirepopulation of the earth be sterilized. And a pandemic virus such as Ebola,capable of wiping out a huge percentage of the human population, is a keyelement of Pianka’s disturbing vision.As if the disease is not deadly enough on its own, the military has also beenbrought into play in the Ebola epidemic. The Pentagon, in addition to the troopssent to Africa, has deployed biological diagnostic systems to National Guardsupport teams in all fifty states in the event of any national emergency event,which could include a pandemic outbreak, even though they claim such an event isimprobable. Why then are so many troops stationed across the country?Can it be that people who rely solely on Western allopathic medicine will die enmasse, victims of a medical system that suppresses medical alternatives offeringeffective remedies from pandemics? It is quite remarkable that even as Westernmedical professionals admit to having no guaranteed remedy against a deadlysupergerm, they nevertheless dismiss any homeopathic treatment regardless of itsefficiency and don’t want people to have access to anything else that might workeither. They echo corporate pharmaceutical officials who warn that herbalmedicine might be dangerous . . . never mind the deadly supergerm.No one argues that Western medicine should not be used in a pandemic, only thatevery possibility, including both Western and Eastern medicine, herbal medicine,nutritional therapies, sunlight therapy, should be considered. Only a fool wouldlimit his options to the one single system of medicine that admittedly offers nocure.With no cure-all forthcoming from medical science, it is perhaps time toquestion the effectiveness and hazards of vaccinations.In many cases, parents have reported abnormal reactions following vaccinations.These included seizures, spiking fevers, diarrhea, lethargy, high-pitchedscreaming, and other abnormalities. The damage may be coming not from thevaccines themselves but from added ingredients such as thimerosal, apreservative used by vaccine manufacturers to save money on production andstorage. Thermerosal, which contains 49.6 percent mercury by weight, canmetabolize or degrade into ethylmercury.A paper published in the June 2009 issue of Toxicological and EnvironmentalChemistry (volume 91, issue 4) concluded the routine administering of childhoodvaccines containing thimerosal could cause “significant cellular toxicity inhuman neuronal and fetal cells.”“This latest study confirms that damage [from thimerosal] does occur in humanneuronal and fetal cells, even at low concentrations,” wrote Dr. Joseph Mercolaof the Illinois Natural Health Center. He noted that rates of autism in the U.S.have increased nearly sixtyfold since the late 1970s, right along with theincreasing number of vaccinations added to the childhood vaccination schedule.Typically, by the age of three, most children have received at least twenty-fourof their scheduled vaccinations. It is at this stage that symptoms of autism maybecome apparent.The academic community’s perspective on thimerosal is indeed grim. As BoydHaley, a retired professor of chemistry at the University of Kentucky, noted,“If you inject thimerosal into an animal, its brain will sicken. If you apply itto living tissue, the cells die. If you put it in a petri dish the culture dies.Knowing these things, it would be shocking if one could inject it into an infantwithout causing damage.”And we should be doubly suspicious of these additives given the remarkably poortrack record of pharmaceutical companies when it comes to ethics and safety. In2012, GlaxoSmithKlein, while denying any wrongdoing, nevertheless pleaded guiltyto criminal charges and paid a $3 billion fine for promoting its antidepressantsfor unapproved uses and failing to report safety data about a top diabetes drug.It was the largest settlement recorded involving a pharmaceutical company. Theagreement also included civil penalties for improper marketing of a half-dozenother drugs.Prosecutors claimed Glaxo used several tactics aimed at promoting the drug Paxilin children when the FDA had not approved it for non-adults. These includedarranging the publication of a medical journal article that misreported datafrom a clinical trial.With such a sketchy history, how can we trust pharmaceutical companies when theyexhort us to inject newborn babies with potentially harmful vaccinations?In part, the problem is that no individual employees are ever held accountablefor these sorts of deadly oversights. No individuals were charged in theGlaxoSmithKline case, nor in the many criminal suits involving other drugmanufacturers. High-dollar settlements were the order of the day, as recordedagainst Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, and others.But large fines don’t appear to affect the questionable practices ofpharmaceutical companies; such practices will not change until drug executivesare singled out for punishment. Former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer,who sued GlaxoSmithKline in 2004, remarked, “What we’re learning is that moneydoesn’t deter corporate malfeasance. The only thing that will work in my view isCEOs and officials being forced to resign and individual culpability beingenforced.”We could learn from the promising prosecution of Dong-Pyou Han, formerlaboratory manager at Iowa State University. In June 2014, federal prosecutorsactually charged Han, a vaccine researcher, with crimes involving making falsestatements. Han confessed to adulterating rabbit blood with human antibodies tocreate the impression that an experimental HIV vaccine might be working. After$5 million was spent in National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, it was foundthat Han’s results, once hailed as “groundbreaking,” were fraudulent. InFebruary 2015, Han accepted a plea deal under which he faces prison time andrestitution payments. Han’s case illustrates the shortcuts and downrightfabrications of some vaccine researchers. Vaccines have been especially in thepublic eye recently because of growing concerns over the possibility thatmultiple vaccinations may lie behind the rising incidence of autism.Autism is a real concern for parents wondering about vaccines. In March 2014,the CDC reported that one in every sixty-eight U.S. children has an autismspectrum disorder (ASD). This is a 30 percent increase from one in eighty-eightonly two years previously. This newest estimate is based on the CDC’s evaluationof the health and educational records of all eight-year-old children in elevenstates.Even more disturbing is the claim by a former CDC scientist that the center,under the leadership of Dr. Julie Gerberding, committed fraud by altering studydata that established a link between vaccination and autism. The study inquestion indicated that mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations caused a350 percent increase in autism in black children. Dr. William Thompson, whoconducted major research on the MMR vaccine, said CDC officials knew of thisdanger as far back as 2001.In support of his theory that the CDC hid information on the vaccine was thispublic statement by Thompson in late August 2014: “I regret that my coauthorsand I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 articlepublished in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that AfricanAmerican males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were atincreased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings toreport after the data were collected, and I believe that the final studyprotocol was not followed.”Dr. Thompson further stated, “The CDC has put the [autism] research ten yearsbehind. Because the CDC has not been transparent, we’ve missed ten years ofresearch [on the autism-vaccine connection] . . . CDC is . . . they’reparalyzed. The whole system is paralyzed right now . . . I have a boss who’sasking me to lie . . . if I’m forced to testify, I’m not gonna lie. I basicallyhave stopped lying.”When vaccine researchers aren’t outright lying over vaccine study data,pharmaceutical companies are accused of subtly manipulating the studies. In thefall of 2014, two former virologists for Merck, Stephen Krahling and JoanWlochowski, added to the vaccine controversy when they filed a lawsuit againsttheir former employer, claiming Merck defrauded the federal government byselling a vaccine that was less effective than advertised. The pair accusedMerck of fraud by testing the effectiveness of its MMR vaccine against theversion of the virus in the vaccine rather than against the natural mumps virusa person would catch in the real world, and of deceptively adding animalantibodies to the test, giving the false appearance of strong human immuneresponse to the vaccine.Attorneys for Merck asked for a dismissal of the case primarily because theyclaimed the FDA was the only authority entitled to act on vaccine issues. OnSeptember 5, 2014, Judge C. Darnell Jones II of the Federal District Court forthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania mostly rejected Merck’s motion to dismiss.Both opponents and proponents of vaccines are awaiting the results of thislawsuit.Despite what pharmaceutical companies would lead us to believe, the evidence ofa link between vaccines and autism is mounting despite the CDC’s position that“numerous studies have found no association between thimerosal exposure andautism.” Many children with autism had followed a normal development path beforeregressing just as they were receiving multiple vaccines during regular doctorvisits. Health officials say the timing is purely coincidental. However, mercuryand other heavy-metal poisons such as thimerasol appear to be a primary driverof autism, according to a 2014 study published in the journal PLOS ComputationalBiology by researchers from the University of Chicago. While they did not studya causal link between vaccines and autism, they found environmental pollution,and particularly mercury and mercury-containing compounds like those fromcoal-fired power plants and diesel engines, may increase a child’s risk ofdeveloping an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by nearly threefold.Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to mercury, a potentneurotoxin that can damage the brain, liver, kidneys, and central nervoussystem. Even small amounts of mercury are capable of causing a number of healthproblems, including impaired motor functioning, decreased cognitive ability, andemotional instability. Higher or prolonged exposure can result in even moreserious health problems.Other dangerous chemicals are also potentially responsible for causing autism.In addition to mercury, plasticizer chemicals, prescription drugs, andenvironmental pesticides contain tiny molecules that interfere with normalchildhood development, leading to autism symptoms, according to the Chicagostudy. As the lead author of the study explains, “Essentially what happens isduring pregnancy there are certain sensitive periods where the fetus is veryvulnerable to a range of small molecules. Some of these small moleculesessentially alter normal development. It’s not really well known why, but it’san experimental observation.”The air we breathe may also be contributing to the autism epidemic. Exposure totraffic fumes, industrial air pollution, and other environmental toxins have allbeen shown to dramatically increase a mother’s chances of having a child withautism. Researchers studied the insurance claims of about a hundred million U.S.citizens and used reports of congenital malformation in newborn boys as anindicator of parental exposure to environmental toxins. Pregnant women living inthe top 20 percent of the most polluted areas evaluated were found to be twiceas likely as women in the least polluted areas to birth a child with autism.Autism isn’t the only disturbing result of these dangerous chemicals. Evidencecontinues to mount that environmental factors, particularly heavy metals, mayalso play a role in the rise of many other diseases and neurological problems. A1977 Russian study found that adults exposed to ethylmercury, the form ofmercury in thimerosal, were at a much higher risk of brain damage later in life.Mercury intake has also been linked to cardiovascular disease, seizures, mentalretardation, hyperactivity, dyslexia, and other debilitating conditions. As aresult of these findings, Russia banned thimerosal from children’s vaccines in1980. Denmark, Austria, Japan, Great Britain, and all the Scandinavian countrieshave also banned the preservative. Yet thimerosal continues to be used as a keyingredient in some vaccines in the United States, and mercury can also still befound in dental amalgam fillings and some commercial fish products.Aluminum is another dangerous element of vaccines. Aluminum is added to vaccinesas an adjuvant in the belief that it will produce a stronger antibody responseand thus be more protective. Aluminum is used in vaccines to selectively targetT helper cells (Th1 and Th2), which push the immunization system to produceantibodies.According to author and lecturer Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, who advocates a holisticapproach to children’s health, aluminum forces the undeveloped and immatureimmune system of infants and children to produce greater amounts of humoralimmune cells (TH2) and antibodies, before their immune systems have a chance toadapt to the world in which they’ve just begun to live. “Under thesecircumstances, the activity of aluminum appears to play a vital role indisrupting the maturation of the immune system in infants and children throughits effects on TH2,” he wrote. Looking at the role of aluminum in vaccines,either acting alone or in conjunction with other vaccine ingredients andenvironmental toxins, Palvesky wonders what role this might play in thedevelopment of chronic illnesses in susceptible children.Polysorbate 80, an emulsifying agent, is another potentially deadly additive invaccines. Clinical studies have shown that polysorbate 80 increases the risk ofserious side effects, such as blood clots, stroke, heart attack, heart failure,and, in some cases, death.“If we’re going to do justice to the topic of vaccine ingredients, we need tolook at the potential harm of all [emphasis in the original] the vaccineingredients at once, and examine their individual effects on our children’simmune and nervous systems. Then, we can examine the interactive effects of thevaccine ingredients on human tissue, and evaluate the potential for harm . . .How many more children need to be potentially harmed before we invoke theprecautionary principle of the Hippocratic Oath—First, Do No Harm?” asked Dr.Palevsky.With the evidence growing that a number of the ingredients in vaccines may bedeadly, even some politicians have expressed concern. Former representative DanBurton of Indiana once asked the FDA to recall all vaccines containing thepreservative thimerosal, explaining, “My only grandson became autistic rightbefore my eyes—shortly after receiving his federally recommended andstate-mandated vaccines. Without a full explanation of what was in the shotsbeing given, my talkative, playful, outgoing healthy grandson Christian wassubjected to very high levels of mercury through his vaccines. He also receivedthe MMR vaccine. Within a few days he was showing signs of autism.” CitingCanadian research concerning the toxicity of mercury, Burton noted, “We havegone from one in 10,000 children with autism to one in 88. It is worse than anepidemic, it is an absolute disaster.”Burton, while chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, asked that $128million be appropriated to study the link between vaccines and autism. “Givingmore money to research is not the only answer though,” said Burton. “Oversightis needed to make sure that research that is funded will sufficiently answer thequestions regarding the epidemic, how to treat autism, and how to prevent thenext ten years from seeing the statistic of 1 in 250 from becoming 1 in 25children. High quality clinical and laboratory research is needed now, not fiveor ten years from now.” While the CDC has denied any connection between vaccinesand autism, Burton urged independent analysis of old CDC studies. But this hasyet to occur.The stories of four prominent doctors connected to the autism debate—BrianHooker, Andrew Wakefield, Thomas Verstraeten, and Poul Thorsen—help to explainthe powerful forces that suppress criticism of vaccinations.Brian Hooker holds a doctorate degree in biochemical engineering and has ateenage son with autism. Motivated by his son’s condition and with the help oftwo congressmen, Hooker spent almost ten years submitting over one hundredFreedom of Information Act [FOIA] requests to the CDC for data linkingmercury-filled thimerosal in vaccines to various disorders. He receivedthousands of documents, but with many key components blacked out. Thesedocuments included five CDC studies on thimerosal and autism written prior to2004 that rejected the connection between thimerosal and autism.Yet the heavily redacted documents Hooker received revealed the CDC had accessto data linking thimerosal in vaccines to autism, nonorganic sleep disorders,and speech disorders but had concealed this from the public. Today, flu shotscontaining thimerosal still are administered to pregnant women and infants.According to Hooker, a 2009 study hid data regarding the only valid part of thestudy (i.e., prenatal thimerosal exposure), which showed that children exposedto just sixteen micrograms of mercury in thimerosal in utero were up to eighttimes more likely to receive a diagnosis of regressive autism.Hooker said his FOIA requests specifically sought information on five CDCstudies on thimerosal and autism prior to 2004. These studies led to anInstitute of Medicine (IOM) Immunization Safety Review Committee report,“Vaccines and Autism,” released in May 2004. Denying any link between thimerosalin the MMR vaccine and autism, this report effectively shut down governmentfunding for any independent research. “Given the constant reference that the CDCand others make to the 2004 IOM report, most of the key components of the FOIAedinformation have been completely redacted by the CDC,” said Hooker, adding thatmuch of the information sought in his FOIA requests has yet to be released bythe CDC.“I would challenge anyone who would rely on the veracity of the CDC studies,”said Hooker. “They’ve repeatedly, purposefully withheld data that clearly show alink between thimerosal and autism (among other NDDs [neurodevelopmentaldisorders]). They’ve obfuscated the main issue via obviously biased statisticalmanipulation. Clearly, the CDC’s conflicted role of vaccine advocate and vaccinesafety guardian has contributed to this whole problem.”Hooker also noted that other countries that vaccinate less and have bannedthimerosal have not experienced comparable autism rates to the United States. Headded his belief that thimerosal has not been removed from U.S. vaccines becauseof “various issues in a concerted effort toward the globalization of vaccines.”Andrew Wakefield, a British former surgeon and medical researcher, supportedHooker in his effort to find the truth. Wakefield is a controversial figure whohas been castigated by the medical establishment and the mainstream media. HisWikipedia page states that the doctor is “known for his fraudulent 1998 researchpaper in support of the now-discredited claim that there is a link between theadministration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism andother ailments.” And in 2010, a five-member tribunal of the British GeneralMedical Council (GMC) found Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and twelve countsinvolving the abuse of developmentally challenged children. He was barred frompracticing medicine and the British medical journal The Lancet retracted his1998 paper.Yet Wakefield’s claims are not nearly as outlandish as they have been made toseem by the media. In late 2011, the Strategic Autism Initiative (SAI), anautism research foundation, announced an investigation into Wakefield’s claimsheaded by Dr. David Lewis, former senior-level research microbiologist for theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a member of the NationalWhistleblowers Center (NWC) board of directors. The SAI rejected the assertionthat Wakefield’s claim was fraudulent. Further research has continued to supportthe doctor. More than twenty-six studies in the U.S., Canada, Venezuela, andItaly replicated Wakefield’s 1998 findings but have not been widely publicized.As director of the MRC’s Research Misconduct Project, Lewis explained thatimportant areas of scientific research are increasingly being manipulated bygovernment agencies, large corporations, and leading universities in order topromote and protect their own interests. Suppressing independent research thatthreatens their interests is critical to their interests. While most scientistsare rarely targeted for retribution by government, industry, or academia, somehave faced false allegations of research misconduct. “Scientists who aretargeted in this manner suffer lifelong consequences, and the chilling effect ithas on other scientists is profound. Few, if any, scientists are willing to stepinto the firing line of government or big industry and risk being martyred,”explained Lewis.The outside pressure the pharmaceutical industry brings to bear on vaccineadvocates explains why many doctors are wary of making any controversialstatements about the effects of vaccines. Dr. Thomas Verstraeten is one suchcase. Verstraeten entered the vaccine fray when he authored a 2001 study whoseinitial phase seemed to indicate a potential link between thimerosal and autism.However, by 2003, Verstraeten said his study ultimately did not support such alink, and he became a supporter of the vaccines. He was accused of yielding tooutside pressure to alter studies indicating a link between thimerosal andautism. One internal CDC document obtained after a FOIA request, showedVerstraeten sent an email that many have interpreted as referring to hisdifficulty in making the statistical association between thimerosal and autismdisappear with the words, “It just won’t go away.”In June 2005, Rolling Stone published an article written by Robert F. KennedyJr. entitled “Deadly Immunity,” which claimed that the federal government andthe pharmaceutical industry colluded to withhold information concerning vaccinesafety. Kennedy also accused Verstraeten of modifying his data to fit the CDC’sclaim that there is no link between thimerosal and autism, an accusation thatVerstraeten has vehemently denied. Yet his personal career choices suggestsomething sinister: shortly after publishing his findings, Verstraeten left theCDC for a position with the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.Verstraeten’s jump is just another illustration of the “revolving door” policybetween government regulators and the corporate world. In 2009, for instance,CDC Director Julie Gerberding left the organization for a job as president ofthe $5 billion vaccine division of Merck.Poul Thorsen is another pro-vaccine doctor whose legitimacy has been called intoquestion. Thorson coauthored some of the most frequently cited CDC studiesdenying the link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Much of thedata cited in these studies remain unavailable to the public. Yet despite thelack of transparency, Thorsen’s research has been hailed by the corporate massmedia, public health establishment, and Big Pharm as “proof” that there is noconnection between vaccines and autism.In 2014, Thorsen was indicted for fraud and stealing grant money while workingfor the CDC. The CDC had awarded him grant money for research in Denmarkinvolving infant disabilities, autism, genetic disorders, and fetal alcoholsyndrome. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’inspector general, Thorsen reportedly diverted more than $1 million of the CDCgrant money to his own personal bank account and submitted fraudulent invoiceson CDC letterhead to medical facilities assisting in the research forreimbursement of work allegedly covered by the grants.In order to find out who is in the right in the vaccine debate, one need onlyfollow the money. Mass inoculations bring more than $25 billion in revenues tothe giant pharmaceutical firms and their hirelings while physicians andresearchers who question mass vaccinations make nothing. In fact, many of themrisk loss of income and ostracism from the conventional medical establishment.Meanwhile, those who trumpet the benefits of vaccines and downplay their riskscan profit enormously.And the government is also getting in on the act. In 2014, the Obama White Houseadmitted that the CIA used a fake vaccination program in Pakistan to covertlyobtain DNA samples from the population as part of the War on Terror. The ideaapparently was to use the DNA to locate members of the bin Laden family inAbbottabad, where Osama bin Laden was suspected of hiding. The Pakistanivaccination ruse has raised concerns that U.S.-sponsored health programs will beused to spy on and even infect people. Already, Taliban leaders in Pakistan andAfghanistan have accused legitimate vaccine workers of being spies.Although White House antiterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco pledged “the agency willnot seek to obtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material acquired throughsuch programs,” many wonder what’s to stop the government from using fakevaccination programs in the future to spread harmful or ineffective substances.“Oops, that already happened,” noted Mike Adams. “It happened right here in theUnited States, in fact, when 98 million Americans were found to have beeninjected with polio vaccines contaminated with cancer-causing viruses [Simianvirus 40]. In order to make sure no one learned about this deadly vaccine snafu,the CDC quietly removed all accounts of this history from its website.”It’s not hard to imagine vaccinations being used for insidious purposes giventhe regulatory issues attached to them. Vaccination critics are especiallyconcerned about the substantial immunity the federal government gives vaccinemakers. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 created the VaccineInjury Compensation Program (VICP), which prevents anyone from filing certaincivil lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Congress handed drug makers thislegal protection that in effect gave them a free pass to market as many vaccinesas they would like. According to its literature, the VICP is “a no-faultalternative to the traditional tort system for resolving vaccine injury claimsthat provides compensation to people found to be injured by certain vaccines.”The VICP is funded by a seventy-five-cent excise tax on every vaccine routinelyadministered to children. This questionable law was upheld by the U.S. SupremeCourt in 2011. Although dissenting judge Sonia Sotomayor warned that thisdecision “leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccinemanufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technologicaladvancements when designing and distributing their products.”This prompts the question: If inoculations are so safe, why did the federalgovernment need to offer pharmaceutical companies immunity from lawsuits?Clearly, the cozy relationship between government and pharmaceutical companiesqualifies as collusion. And the mainstream media is complicit in thisarrangement, refusing to call out vaccine makers even when the evidence isstrong. One example of a media leader who spoke up, and paid the price, is KatieCouric, the first female news anchor on a major network. Couric sparked anavalanche of criticism in December 2013 by simply addressing the issue ofvaccine safety. Despite the fact that she gave voice to both sides of the debateover Gardasil, the HPV vaccine that has been linked with a number ofdebilitating side effects, she was savagely attacked as antivaccine.A vigorous supporter of the HPV vaccine, Alexandra Sifferlin, penned a Timeeditorial charging that Couric was following in the footsteps of Jenny McCarthy,a cohost of the ABC talk show The View, who has claimed vaccines bring onautism. “The damage a former Playboy Bunny has been able to do is bad enough.But Couric’s misdeeds are all the worse given that she’s taken much moreseriously than Jenny McCarthy,” wrote Sifferlin.Shortly after Couric’s vaccine program aired, she backpedaled in a HuffingtonPost article. “Following the show, and in fact before it even aired, there wascriticism that the program was too anti-vaccine and anti-science, and inretrospect, some of that criticism was valid. We simply spent too much time onthe serious adverse events that have been reported in very rare cases followingthe vaccine. More emphasis should have been given to the safety and efficacy ofthe HPV vaccines,” wrote Couric. She added that as a journalist, she felt shecould not ignore reports of adverse reactions—including death—to HPV vaccines.“But based on the science, my personal view is that the benefits of the HPVvaccine far outweigh its risks,” she added.“The shaming of Katie Couric for caring and daring to ask questions aboutGardasil vaccine, was a well-orchestrated campaign of intimidation. It was awarning delivered to all journalists that—no matter who you are—your characterwill be assassinated if you step out of line and question the safety oreffectiveness of a government recommended vaccine,” countered Barbara Loe Fisherin a 2014 article for the National Vaccine Information Center.After noting that the 14,000 annual deaths in the U.S. from six cancersassociated with HPV represents less than 3 percent of the more than 550,000yearly cancer deaths, Fisher concluded, “Whatever the reasons that governmentofficials made HPV vaccination a top public health priority in the U.S., thecyber-lynching of Katie Couric and mothers reporting Gardasil vaccine reactionsis a warning to parents everywhere. Do not forget that the cruel, dogmaticposition of vaccine risk denialism is: Roll up your sleeve—no questionsasked—and ‘may the odds be ever in your favor.’”Often mass media outlets carry lurid stories designed to instill fear ofvaccination critics. “An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping ShotsEndangers Us All” was the headline of an article by Amy Wallace in the October2009 issue of Wired. Wallace detailed the abuse, including death threats,against Dr. Paul Offit, a Philadelphia pediatrician who is co-inventor of avaccine that some claim can save thousands of lives. Others point to Offit as“the vaccine industry’s most well-paid spokesperson.”“This isn’t a religious dispute, like the debate over creationism andintelligent design,” wrote Wallace. “It’s a challenge to traditional sciencethat crosses party, class, and religious lines. It is partly a reaction to BigPharma’s blunders and PR missteps, from Vioxx to illegal marketing ploys, whichhave encouraged a distrust of experts.”Critics such as Health Ranger Mike Adams have turned the antiscience argumentagainst vaccine supporters. “Note carefully that vaccine zealots are notscientifically-minded people; they are religious zealots who worship thereligion of vaccines. Their ‘belief’ in vaccines is based purely on faith; allevidence be damned! Anyone who studies autism is immediately ostracized anddiscredited even if their research only hints at a link between autism andvaccines,” he wrote. “Anyone who does not conform to the myths and lies of thismedical Mafia is subjected to widespread character assassination, where endlesslies are spread about them. I’ve even been accused of being ‘anti-science’ eventhough I run a scientific laboratory using atomic spectroscopy equipment toresearch food safety! In reality, I’m one of the most ‘scientific’ activists inthe country, yet because I express concern of the safety of mercury in vaccines,I too am immediately and viciously branded ‘anti-science.’ Anyone who isanti-mercury, it turns out, is automatically labeled ‘anti-science.’”It turns out that there are legitimate scientific reasons to be concerned aboutmercury levels in vaccines. In mid-2014, Adams, working through the Natural NewsForensic Food Lab, tested the FluLaval influenza vaccine manufactured byGlaxoSmithKline and found lot 9H2GX contained fifty-one parts per million ofmercury, more than twenty-five thousand times higher than the maximum levelpermitted by the EPA in drinking water. The concentration of mercury in the flushot was one hundred times greater than the highest level he had ever found intuna and other ocean fish known for high mercury contamination. “And yetvaccines are injected [emphasis in the original] directly into the body, makingthem many times more toxic than anything ingested orally,” he noted.And despite the toxicity, the efficacy of many vaccines is unclear. By 2005,vaccinations had reduced the annual incidence of mumps in the United States bymore than 99 percent. However, the next year a large outbreak occurred amonghighly vaccinated populations in the United States with similar outbreaksreported worldwide. Eighty-nine percent of those who contracted mumps hadalready been vaccinated at least twice for the disease, presumably with thecontroversial measles, mumps, and rubella combination vaccine that has beenimplicated in causing gastrointestinal disorders and autism. These numbersindicate that the MMR vaccine was, in this case, essentially ineffective inpreventing the disease, and offer strong support to parents who would thinktwice about administering this vaccine to their children.Despite the risks inherent in vaccines, they won’t be going away anytime soon.Vaccine revenues in 2013 reached more than $25 billion, with pharmaceuticalprofits ensuring government advocacy of the shots. The vaccine market isexpected to return a compound annual growth rate of more than 8 percent through2018. Though vaccines have generated profits for a few massive pharmaceuticalfirms, the rest of us have suffered, and will continue to do so for theforeseeable future."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-13]GONE TO POT [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-13]IF EVER THERE WERE A SINGLE DRUG THAT COULD BE DEFINITELY linked to a variety ofsocial problems—dangerous driving, domestic violence, health issues, and more—itwould be alcohol. Yearly, almost eighty-eight thousand Americans die fromalcohol-related causes, making it the third leading preventable cause of deathin the United States. So it was with noble intentions that prohibitionistsfought for decades to have alcohol outlawed, finally succeeding in 1917. It tookAmericans just over a dozen years to realize that alcohol prohibition was notworking and was creating worse problems than alcohol had. Recognizing thefailure of this law, Congress passed the Twenty-First Amendment, whichofficially ended Prohibition.But when it comes to other drugs, the United States has learned remarkablylittle from Prohibition, enacting the same failed policies. Ninety years afterthe sale and use of marijuana was made a crime in the U.S., the so-called War onDrugs continues.Although a few states in recent years have passed legislation decriminalizing orlegalizing marijuana, the majority continue to classify its sale or use as acriminal offense. In 2014, more than 50 percent of federal prison inmates werethere for drug offenses, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Thatpercentage has grown over decades from a mere 16 percent in 1970. In Texas,nearly 90 percent of state prison inmates were incarcerated because of drugoffenses. This is despite the fact that marijuana, commonly called “pot” or“weed,” continues to gain favor with Americans. A 2013 national survey on druguse and health by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA) found marijuana use increased steadily since 2007. The comprehensivesurvey, involving seventy thousand people above the age of twelve, reported that7.3 percent of Americans regularly used marijuana in 2012, up from 7 percent in2011 and significantly higher than the 5.8 percent in the 2007 survey. Andself-reporting bias indicates that the true number of Americans who usemarijuana may be even higher.Even those who don’t use the drug are increasingly tolerant of its use, as aFebruary 2014 survey from the Pew Research Center confirmed. The survey showedthat 67 percent of Americans in all demographic groups thought the governmentshould focus more on providing treatment for, and less on punishing, those whouse illegal drugs. Surprisingly, this sentiment cuts across party lines; morethan half of those who felt the government should focus more on treatment thanprosecution of marijuana identified themselves as Republicans. A full 75 percentof those polled felt the drug will eventually be legalized in all states.The ACLU advised, “This waning public support [for drug prohibition] iswarranted, as evidence continues to document how the War on Drugs has destroyedmillions of lives, unfairly impacted communities of color, made drugs cheaperand more potent, caused countless deaths of innocent people caught up in drugwar-related armed conflict, and failed to eliminate drug dependence andaddiction.” In short, Americans are fed up with the current government policy ondrugs.By 2015, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia had legalizedmarijuana in some form, while four states have legalized it for recreationaluse, including Alaska and Oregon, where voters in 2014 approved legalization ofrecreational pot to become effective in 2015. Colorado and Washington previouslypassed similar ballot measures legalizing marijuana in 2012.Yet while many Americans support the legalization of marijuana, and a number ofstates have legalized or decriminalized the drug, in some places the fightagainst weed continues unabated.In 1992, there were 812 arrests for small amounts of marijuana in New York City.By 2012, this number had risen to 39,218, and represented almost a million hourswasted by law enforcement officers. Many have pointed to the social costs ofdraconian marijuana policies. As civil rights organizer Alfredo Carrasquillo putit, “We cannot afford to continue arresting tens of thousands of youth everyyear for low-level marijuana possession. We can’t afford it in terms of thenegative effect it has on the future prospects of our youth and we can’t affordit in terms of police hours.” Such arrests ruin the lives of offenders whootherwise pose no threat to society.Many well-intentioned people have been unfairly caught up in the antidrughysteria. In 2013, child protective authorities took the six-month-old daughterof a Michigan couple, Gordon and Maria Green, whom they accused of havingmarijuana in the home, even though medical marijuana was legal under state law.Critics have accused caseworkers of using scare tactics to intimidate parents,telling them that while their possession of pot is legal under state law, theymust surrender their children. Cases such as these go beyond concern over druguse and shed light on the deceptive practices of child protection agencies. Inmany states, these agencies receive funding based on the number of children theywarehouse.As usual, it is all about the money. According to a 2013 Congressional ResearchService report, at least nineteen federal agencies receive billions in antidrugfunding today. The nation spends approximately $51 billion yearly on the drugwar, with the bulk of this money going to law enforcement. About $24 billion inantidrug money goes to the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, and theDepartment of Health and Human Services, and even organizations such as theAgriculture Department, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. ForestService receive significant funds. That makes for a huge number ofadministrators and staff dependent on the War on Drugs for their financiallivelihood. The human cost of these policies is massive. According to the DrugPolicy Alliance, there were 1.5 million people in the U.S. arrested onnonviolent drug charges in 2012. Of them, 749,825 were related to marijuana,658,231 for mere possession.In an effort to defend their irrational policies, marijuana opponents havegrasped at a number of unlikely arguments. In April 2014, Michele Leonhart, thehead of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), while testifying to a HouseAppropriations Subcommittee hearing on the DEA budget, went so far as to attemptto state that pot should remain illegal because of the risk that family petscould become ill from consuming edible marijuana products.“There was just an article last week, and it was on pets,” she told Housemembers. “It was about the unanticipated or unexpected consequences of this[legalization], and how veterinarians now are seeing dogs come in, their petscome in, and being treated because they’ve been exposed to marijuana.”The article in question appeared in USA Today, which stated that the effects ofmarijuana could make it more difficult for a dog to breathe or vomit up aswallowed item. However, the article also noted that “marijuana itself isn’tparticularly harmful to dogs” and that dogs are unlikely to eat the drug unlessit is baked into a food appealing to them, such as brownies.Zack Carter, senior political economy reporter for the Huffington Post, during amedia interview, told how once, while he was in high school, his pet beagle,Pepper, ate an entire ounce of pot contained in some brownies. He said the dogwas high for three or four days—falling over, staggering around, and wettingherself—but fully recovered. “I wouldn’t want anyone to have that experiencealthough it was pretty funny. The dog ate an entire ounce of weed and wasbasically fine, so I think the DEA is barking up the wrong tree,” he said. Giventhat a number of common household foods, such as chocolate and pecans, are farmore toxic to dogs than marijuana is, using our pets to justify drug prohibitionis a questionable line of reasoning at best.Though the antidrug lobby has largely succeeded in fostering an irrationalculture of fear when it comes to drugs, there have been a few legislative stepsin the right direction. At the end of May 2014, even pro-pot advocates weretaken aback when the House passed an amendment to the appropriations bill thatwould prevent the DEA and federal prosecutors from targeting medical marijuanain states where it is legal. While pushback from entrenched antipot forces wasexpected as the appropriations process moved along, passage of the amendmentclearly showed a major shift in the thinking of House members, who supported itin a bipartisan vote of 219 to 189.And in late 2014, Congress, in narrow votes both in the House and Senate,approved the Continuing Resolution Omnibus Bill funding the government thatincluded a de facto declaration of truce in the War on Drugs marijuana front.Included in the legislation to be signed into law by President Obama was aclause forbidding the spending of federal money to prosecute pot possession andsales in states that have approved medical marijuana.The bill stated, “None of the funds made available in this Act to the Departmentof Justice [which includes the FBI] may be used, with respect to the States ofAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Districtof Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, NewHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States fromimplementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution,possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.”Yet overall, the federal government has not been progressive when it comes todrug policy. Instead, the states have taken the lead; the Pew Research Centerreported that between 2009 and 2013, forty states moved to ease severe mandatorydrug laws.In August 2013, there was a shift in federal policy. Attorney General EricHolder announced that the Justice Department would not challenge states thathave legalized use of small amounts of marijuana or medical marijuana if thestates enacted strict measures to keep the drugs away from minors and took stepsto regulate them.But the actions of the feds belied Holder’s words. Even while pledging not tointerfere with states that decriminalized pot, federal officers continued toraid pot shops in California. In late October 2013, federal agents attempted toseize the property of California’s Berkeley Patients Group (BPG), a medicalmarijuana dispensary, and essentially shut down the business.“The Obama administration’s ongoing war against patients is despicable and hasto stop,” said Steph Sherer, executive director of Americans for Safe Access.“This is a mean, vindictive move aimed at shutting down one of the oldest andmost well-respected dispensaries in the country.” Berkeley City Council memberDarryl Moore agreed, offering a resolution that stated, “BPG has served as anational model of the not-for-profit, services-based medical cannabisdispensary.”Moore claimed such dispensaries improve lives and assist in end-of-lifetransitions of thousands of patients and have been significant donors to dozensof other organizations which have shaped local, state, and national policiesaround medical cannabis.Even as voters indicate a willingness to soften pot laws, federal machineryworks against the marijuana business.In 1982, Congress amended the U.S. tax code to include section 280E, whichprevents businesses selling a Schedule I or II drug, such as heroin,methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana, from deducting all normal businessexpenses. This code was enacted as the Supreme Court had ruled that even illegalbusinesses must pay taxes but cannot claim the usual deductions.Despite pleas to amend the tax laws, an IRS spokesperson said only Congress canamend the Internal Revenue Code or the Controlled Substance Act.“I believe that the feds extend the drug war through 280E,” said JordanCornelius, a Denver accountant who has worked with marijuana companies inColorado. “If [the federal government] can’t put them out of business legallywhen voters are mandating these businesses to move forward, it’s very easy toput them out of business financially . . . A lot of times, instead of paying atax rate that should be 30 to 40 percent, they are paying rates between 80 or 90percent,” Cornelius explained. “I even have a client right now that is payingmore than 100 percent effective tax rate.”“The problem is that we have passed laws that allowed these medical marijuanaand recreational marijuana companies to do business,” said University of Denverfinance professor Mac Clouse. “But we have all these other laws, tax laws,federal laws that make it incredibly difficult if not utterly impossible tosurvive.”Under the oversight of the federal government, the DEA has been aggressive inpursuing leads connected to the War on Drugs. In testimony to the House, DEAChief Michele Leonhart was asked if DEA agents were demoralized by the risingtide of pro-pot legislation and the decision of the Justice Department not tochallenge the states’ decisions on marijuana. “Actually, it makes us fightharder,” she responded, reflecting the division in opinions within thegovernment.Perhaps when someone determines how to corner the market on medical marijuanafor some large corporation, the feds will finally relax their antipot campaign.Indeed, one reason the federal government may be unwilling to legalize marijuanais that they’ve yet to figure out how to make money off of it.Some suspect the federal government’s crackdown on pot is merely an attempt tosquelch any competition to its own medical marijuana business. On October 7,2003, a patent (number 6,630,507) for medical marijuana was granted and assignedto “The United States of America as represented by the Department of Health andHuman Services (Washington, DC).”Titled “Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants,” the patent abstractclaimed “cannabinoids [the chemicals found in cannabis or marijuana] have beenfound to have antioxidant properties . . . This newfound property makescannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety ofoxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory andautoimmune diseases.”The U.S. government may be able to profit off of marijuana in ways that extendpast recreational use. This patent for medical marijuana comes at a time whenstudies are finding new medical uses for the psychoactive properties of pot.Research at the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology found the cannabinoidmolecules in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could slow or even stop the progress ofAlzheimer’s disease. “Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for thetreatment of Alzheimer’s disease, THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of[peptide] aggregation, and this study provides a previously unrecognizedmolecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may directly impact theprogression of this debilitating disease,” said study author Lisa M. Eubanks.The promise THC holds as a potential curative for Alzheimer’s has even beenacknowledged by the National Institutes of Health.Sayer Ji, writing in Waking Times, argues that if the medical benefits ofcannabis found in peer-reviewed studies were made public, they would include onehundred “proven therapeutic actions of this amazing plant.” These would include:analgesic (pain-killing), antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressive,bronchodilator, antioxidant, cardioprotective, antitumor, enzyme inhibitor,antipsychotic, and many others. Thanks to scientific investigation, the ideathat marijuana has beneficial medicinal qualities is no longer merelytheoretical.The elitist-controlled medical community, in league with corporate Big Pharma,has created a medical-industrial complex that does not want consumers usingnatural compounds for healing. Such use of naturally grown remedies mightthreaten the medical business model, which may explain the aggressive stance ofboth doctors and government toward homeopathic treatments. It also may explainwhy the prison population in America consisting of more than six million people,exceeds the number of prisoners held in the gulags of the former Soviet Union atany point in its history.The production of hemp is another area where the DEA has been overly aggressivein pursuing potential offenders. Congress has become more lenient on hemp, andthe 2014 Farm Bill eased restrictions on growing it. The bill also contained aclause allowing colleges and universities to grow hemp for research purposes. Onthe state level, more than a dozen states, including Oregon, Montana, Colorado,North Dakota, California, Kentucky, Vermont, West Virginia, and Maine, havelegalized hemp, used for paper, clothing, rope, and other practicalapplications.Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center, said thatwhile production is not completely legal, many states are growing hemp. “Fieldsof hemp are growing in Colorado already,” noted Boldin in early 2014. “Vermontlegalized late last summer, and multiple other states are considering bills todo the same this year. Credit doesn’t go to the feds on this one. It belongs tothe states, which had the courage to stand up to unconstitutional laws, andforce the change on a national level.”Yet the DEA has obstructed local efforts to grow hemp. In May 2014, Kentuckyagriculture commissioner James Comer sought an injunction to stop federalofficials from halting the importation of 286 pounds of Italian hemp seedsordered by the department, which needed to be planted by the beginning of June.The plans of local farmers who intended to plant the seeds and harvest the hempwere stalled until U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II made a decision. TheDEA had ordered U.S. Customs to hold the seeds because they said Kentuckyofficials failed to get a controlled-substance import permit.This sort of interference rightfully drew the ire of a number of congressmen.Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell called on the DEA to release the hempseed, noting the federal Farm Bill passed earlier in the year allowed statedepartments of agriculture, along with universities, to grow industrial hemp forresearch purposes. In a statement, McConnell remarked, “It is an outrage thatDEA is using finite taxpayer dollars to impound legal industrial hemp seeds. Theagency should immediately release the hemp seeds so Kentucky pilot projects canget under way, which will ultimately lead to more economic opportunities in ourstate.” Senator Rand Paul echoed McConnell, saying the federal impounding of theseeds was “completely unacceptable.”The politicians’ support, along with public pressure, worked. On May 23, the DEAapproved a permit and released the seeds for research. Adam Watson, theindustrial hemp coordinator for the state agriculture department, reiterated theessentially harmless nature of the project, remarking, “It’s been such a longperiod of time since any hemp has been grown in Kentucky [that] we really don’tknow what we’re dealing with. So the purpose of all these research projects isto evaluate how these varieties perform and what’s the best method for Kentuckyproducers to grow it.” Although hemp and marijuana are of the same species,Cannabis sativa, hemp has a lesser amount of the euphoria-producing psychoactivecompound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) than marijuana. One wonders why the DEA isso focused on crackdowns on safe products such as hemp when they could beturning their efforts to more dangerous illicit drugs.Federal obstructionism continued in 2014 when the U.S. Bureau of Reclamationannounced that they would continue to prevent pot growers from using federalirrigation waters. Since 1902, the bureau has been charged with maintainingdams, power plants, and canals in seventeen western states, including Washingtonand California, two states that have legalized recreational marijuana use.“As a federal agency, Reclamation is obligated to adhere to federal law in theconduct of its responsibilities to the American people,” stated Dan DuBray, thebureau’s chief of public affairs. Ellen Canale, a spokeswoman for Holder’sJustice Department chimed in, saying, “The Department of Justice will continueto enforce the Controlled Substances Act and will focus federal resources on themost significant threats to our communities.” The cultivation of marijuana isapparently considered to be a significant threat.The DOJ outlined eight factors in particular on which it would focus, most ofthem not presenting any real problem. They include: preventing the distributionof marijuana to minors, a task already reasonably met with alcohol and tobacco;preventing revenue from the sale of the drug from going to criminal enterprises,which seems no different from money going to illegal activities through legalbusinesses; preventing diversion to states where it is illegal, this assuming itwill remain illegal; preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from beingused as a cover for other illegal drug activity, as if this is not alreadyhappening; preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation ofmarijuana, which could be accomplished by legalization; preventing druggeddriving and other adverse public health consequences, as if there are not DUIlaws now; preventing the cultivation of marijuana on public lands; andpreventing marijuana possession or use on federal property, as if this is notalready happening.Growers and others connected to the marijuana industry are resigned tointerference from the feds. “We’re used to this kind of treatment,” said ElanNelson, a business consultant for Medicine Man dispensary in Denver. “Thefederal government is looking for one obstacle after another to place hurdlesbefore this industry,” Nelson warned. “Pretty soon it’s going to be air. They’regoing to say you can’t use the air because it belongs to the federal government.It’s just ridiculous.”The feds’ opposition to marijuana cultivation has even impacted the bankingcommunity. Colorado’s two largest banks, Wells Fargo and FirstBank, haveattempted to cut off the pot industry, refusing to offer new loans to landownerswith preexisting leases for pot businesses. Wells Fargo also gave commercialreal estate clients an ultimatum: either evict marijuana businesses or seekrefinancing elsewhere. Wells Fargo defends its policy by pointing out that suchloans theoretically are subject to federal drug-seizure laws, putting the bankat risk. “Our policy of not banking marijuana-related businesses and not lendingon commercial properties leased by marijuana-related businesses is based onapplicable federal laws,” explained Wells Fargo spokeswoman Cristie Drumm.Again, the banking industry is at the mercy of the federal government in itscrusade against pot.Similar banking restrictions were the subject of a 2014 lawsuit filed by medicalmarijuana dispensary Allgreens LLC against the IRS. The IRS does not accept taxpayments in cash, putting dispensaries, which are often unable to open bankaccounts, in a bind, as Allgreens pointed out. “The taxpayer is unable to securea bank account due to the nature of its business. With no bank account and noaccess to banking services, the taxpayer is simply incapable of making thepayments electronically,” explained Allgreens’ attorney Rachel Gillette. Sheadded that the IRS suggested the firm pay a third party to deliver the taxes, asuggestion that seems to amount to tacit IRS approval of money laundering.The threat of selective federal enforcement was accentuated in 2013, whenObama’s drug czar, Gil Kerlikowske, repeatedly stated the administration had a“zero tolerance policy” toward drug use, and federal efforts to punish potsmokers reached new heights of absurdity.In October 2013, Angela Kirking, an Illinois face-painting artist, was awakenedin her home by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with gunsdrawn. “They were in full attack mode, came at me guns raised, flashlights. Justlike you see in the movies,” Kirking said. Her crime? Three weeks earlier shehad purchased a bottle of organic fertilizer from a nearby garden store beingmonitored by the DEA for persons buying hydroponic equipment, which could beused to grow pot. The raid, consisting of four DEA agents and five Shorewood,Illinois, police officers, included a thorough search of Kirking’s householdtrash, where one officer claimed he detected “a strong odor of green cannabis.”Further searching revealed 9.3 grams of pot, a small quantity for personal use,in the woman’s art room.The raid raises troubling questions about the threshold of evidence required forlaw enforcement to obtain a warrant to search private property. The “odor” anglemay see increased use by police as more states legalize pot. Denver, forexample, recently passed an odor ordinance with a hefty fine of up to $2,000 forpolluting the air. In an effort to settle arguments over whether smoking pot inone’s own home violates the law, the city defined smoking as an offense when thesmoke is mixed with seven times the volume of clean air, creating a strong odor.Ben Siller, a member of Denver’s Department of Environmental Health, moves abouttown with an olfactometer, a device to check if the smell of marijuana isbreaking the odor law. Many feel the law itself stinks.A similar raid occurred in the Kansas City, Kansas, suburb of Leawood, wherelawmen with bulletproof vests and using SWAT team attack tactics raided the homeof Robert and Adlynn Harte after Robert had shopped at a hydroponic garden storefor materials to build an indoor vegetable garden for his son. The Hartes, itturned out, were former CIA employees and no drugs were found, although oneofficer suggested their thirteen-year-old son might have used pot.These incident-s are just two examples of the activist drug policing carried outacross the country. The ultimate effect of federal government overreach onmarijuana policy, of course, is seen in our prisons. Pot prohibition in the U.S.has resulted in wrongful arrests and ruined lives for offenders, not to mentionovercrowded prisons mostly filled with drug offenders.An ACLU report released in June 2013 showed that while marijuana arrests havedecreased since 2006, there are still significantly more of them than there werein the early 2000s. Nearly half of all drug arrests are for pot, and often forminor transgressions: a full 88 percent of marijuana arrests are for simplepossession. The report also indicated a racial bias in pot busts, as blacks are3.73 times more likely to be arrested for pot possession than whites.The report also noted the financial cost of our obsession with drug prohibition.Despite the fact that many states face pension shortfalls and budget crunches,marijuana-related arrests continue to drain public coffers. The ACLU estimatedthat nationally, the cost of arrests just for possessing marijuana runssomewhere between $1 billion and $6 billion per year. The states spending themost money per capita arresting pot users were New York (which spends almosttwice as much as any other state), Maryland, Illinois, Wyoming, Nevada,Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Arizona.And many states waste significant funds keeping prisoners incarcerated, not tomention the human costs of these draconian drug regulations. In Texas, forinstance, nineteen-year-old Jacob Lavoro faced a life sentence in prison forbaking and selling brownies laced with pot. Lavoro’s crime was listed as afirst-degree felony because his brownie recipe included hash oil, which allowedprosecutors to include the sugar, cocoa, butter, and other ingredients whendetermining the weight of the drugs. His father, Joe Lavoro, complained, “Fiveyears to life? I’m sorry. I’m a law-abiding citizen. I’m a conservative. I lovemy country. I’m a Vietnam veteran, but I’ll be damned. This is wrong.” Even hisson’s attorney, Jack Holmes, questioned the law, stating, “I was outraged. I’vebeen doing this twenty-two years as a lawyer and I’ve got ten years as a policeofficer and I’ve never seen anything like this before.”Such stiff penalties are in part the legacy of the Controlled Substances Act of1970. In this piece of legislation, the DEA classified pot as a Schedule I drug,placing it in the same category as far more dangerous drugs such as heroin.Other drugs classified as Schedule I include cocaine, crack cocaine,amphetamines, and crystal meth; meanwhile alcohol and tobacco, which areresponsible for the greatest number of drug-related deaths in the United States,are not scheduled at all.“We’re stuck in a catch-22,” said Tamar Todd, senior staff attorney for the DrugPolicy Alliance. “The DEA is saying that marijuana needs FDA approval to beremoved from Schedule I, but at the same time they are obstructing that veryresearch. While there is a plethora of scientific evidence establishingmarijuana’s safety and efficacy, the specific clinical trials necessary to gainFDA approval have long been obstructed by the federal government itself.“The scheduling is made within the context of a law enforcement agency and thatlaw enforcement agency has an interest in keeping drugs illegal and maintainingthe status quo,” she added.Adding the federal restrictions on marijuana research to the IRS sanctionsagainst pot business deductions and to the DOJ’s continued enforcement of olddrug laws, it is apparent that those who control the federal governmentmachinery do not want the public to have easy access to pot.Another federal catch-22 involves the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms andExplosives (BATF), which on its Form 4473 asks potential firearm purchasers:“Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant,stimulant, narcotic drug, or other controlled substance?” Even if your state haslegalized pot, if you are a user, you must reply yes, which then opens you tosearch under “reasonable cause” as a user of a controlled substance. Suchpersons are prohibited by federal law from their constitutional right topossess, trade in, or transfer firearms or ammunition. All this despite the factthat marijuana is one of the few drugs for which there is no lethal dose and noproven long-term harm. On the other hand, tobacco causes forty-six times moredeaths than all illegal drugs combined, while prescription drugs cause twice asmany deaths as all illegal drugs combined.Furthermore, harsh policies on marijuana do not lead to lower rates of drugabuse. A recent World Health Organization survey showed that the United Stateshas the highest level of illegal drug use in the world. Meanwhile,forward-thinking countries are liberalizing their drug policies, following thelead of Uruguay, which in 2014 became the first national government to grow,regulate, and safely distribute pot.Although many U.S. lawmakers remain stubbornly resistant to such a move, someare beginning to come around, thanks to the oil that has always greased theAmerican political system: money. States that have legalized marijuana havealready reaped tremendous financial gains. As of February 2014, the state ofColorado had already collected at least $100 million in revenue from marijuanataxes. Colorado governor John Hickenlooper predicted that 2015 sales and excisetaxes on marijuana would generate $98 million for the state, well above the $70million annual estimate floated when voters approved the taxes. In Washington,budget forecasters predicted the state’s new legal recreational marijuana marketcould swell coffers by more than $190 million over four years starting inmid-2015, a fact that has not been lost on many observers. “Voters and statelawmakers around the country are watching how this system unfolds in Colorado[and Washington], and the prospect of generating significant revenue whileeliminating the underground marijuana market is increasingly appealing,” saidMason Tvert, a legalization activist for the Marijuana Policy Project. Shouldother states also decide to legalize the drug and tax it aggressively, theywould stand to gain similar benefits.Beyond tax revenues, the legalization drive has also benefited the economy bycreating a whole new industry with new jobs and opportunities. By mid-2014,Colorado had established a huge business in pot, with about 340 medicinal andrecreational pot shops open in Denver alone. More impressively, fears over thelegalization of weed appeared unfounded, with both crime and traffic fatalitiesdown. According to Denver police, burglaries and robberies dropped between 4 and5 percent in the first four months of 2014. Contrary to some expectations, datareleased by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in mid-2014showed pot use among high school students had stagnated, and was actuallybeginning to decline. The percentage of teens who reported using marijuana inthe previous month dropped from 22 percent in 2011 to 20 percent in 2013.Traffic fatalities also decreased following legalization, to the surprise ofsome observers. Yet research has suggested a link between liberal marijuanapolicies and low traffic fatality rates. Studies from the Dutch Institute forRoad Safety, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Administration, the UnitedKingdom Transport Research Lab, Colorado University, and Montana StateUniversity have all come to the same conclusion: postlegalization, Coloradoexperienced a drop in both traffic fatalities and beer sales. The studiesindicate that there is crossover between recreational drinkers and marijuanausers, and that marijuana users are less likely to take risks and driverecklessly.It should be noted, however, that those supporting decriminalization of pot donot necessarily support recreational use of the drug.Natural health activist Mike Adams explained it this way: “I am wholeheartedlyin support of marijuana decriminalization, yet at the same time I stronglyencourage people to avoid smoking it. That’s the difference between me and apolice state government, by the way—I believe in your right to choose what youwish to do with your body, while the police state government would far prefer toshove a gun in your face, slap a pair of handcuffs on your wrists and throw youinto the prison system, which is little more than a modern-day slave labor campthat benefits corporate interests under the guise of fighting the ‘war ondrugs.’”As with any other substance capable of abuse, there are many legitimate reasonsto control the sale and use of marijuana, just as with alcohol and tobacco. Manypeople have trouble distinguishing between the decriminalization of pot, whichwould save lives, careers, and lessen the prison population, and its totallegalization, including recreational use.With so many positive consequences of the legalization of marijuana in Colorado,it’s fair to ask why so many remain opposed to reforming drug policy. Again, itall comes back to the money. A number of pot opponents, particularly those withimpressive credentials, may be under the influence of Big Pharma, as Lee Fangsuggested in a 2014 article in Vice magazine. “Vice has found that many of theresearchers who have advocated against legalizing pot have also been on thepayroll of leading pharmaceutical firms with products that could be easilyreplaced by using marijuana,” wrote Fang. “When these individuals have beenquoted in the media, their drug-industry ties have not been revealed.”One such expert, Dr. Herbert Kleber of Columbia University, is vocal about thedangers of marijuana and has been quoted in such media outlets as CBS, NPR, andCNBC. Kleber’s warnings against marijuana have been cited by the New York StateAssociation of Chiefs of Police and the American Psychiatric Association.“What’s left unsaid is that Kleber has served as a paid consultant to leadingprescription drug companies, including Purdue Pharma (the maker of OxyContin),Reckitt Benckiser (the producer of a painkiller called Nurofen), and Alkermes(the producer of a powerful new opioid called Zohydro),” notes Fang.Other academic opponents to marijuana legalization cited by Fang includeassociate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School Dr. A. Eden Evins, aboard member of the antipot organization Project SAM. Following Evins’scollaboration in an article on marijuana legalization for the Journal ofClinical Psychiatry, the publication found that as of November 2012 she was aconsultant for Pfizer and DLA Piper, a law firm which in 2014 advised Pfizer onthe $635 million acquisition of Baxter commercial vaccines. She also hadreceived grant/research support from Envivo, GlaxoSmithKline, as well as Pfizer,Another outspoken pot critic was Dr. Mark L. Kraus, a board member of theAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine. Dr. Kraus opposed a proposed medicalmarijuana law offered in 2012 in Connecticut. According to Fang’s research,financial disclosures showed Kraus had served on a scientific advisory panel forpainkiller producers such as Pfizer and Reckitt Benckiser in the year prior tohis activism against the bill. Fang said none of the experts named responded tohis requests for comment. Such conflicts of interest further help to explain thereasons for the crusade against marijuana.Our government policy on pot has been misguided since the original fears of“reefer madness,” which date to the first half of the twentieth century. Likevaccines, our attitude toward illicit drugs has been corrupted and secretlyguided by a small number of elites who profit from prohibition. In cases wheremarijuana has been legalized, the citizens have benefited, but powerful,entrenched forces have helped to stem the tide of legalization. The situation isreprehensible. Yet even more disconcerting is the damage being done by entirelylegal prescription drugs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-15]PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS AND SHOOTERS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-15]DURING THE DEBATE OVER MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION, A DARK side to the use of legaldrugs was largely overlooked. Because of the overuse and mishandling of legalprescription drugs, America has experienced a terrifying rise in teen suicides,school shootings, and the deaths of many veterans. Then secretary of veteranaffairs Eric Shinseki reported in November 2009 that “more veterans havecommitted suicide since 2001 than we have lost on the battlefields of Iraq andAfghanistan.”In May 2014, another shooting by a seemingly average kid rocked the nation.Twenty-two-year-old Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured thirteen othersin a rampage in Isla Vista, California, that ended with his taking his own life.Immediately, his father and the corporate mass media began the drumbeat, blamingguns for the carnage despite the fact that Rodger’s first three kills were witha knife. There were no calls for registering or outlawing bladed instruments.Although Rodger also rammed at least one victim with his car, no one called foroutlawing automobiles. In a “manifesto” left behind, Rodger stated, “I wasdifferent because I am of mixed race. I am half White, half Asian, and this mademe different from the normal fully-white kids that I was trying to fit in with.I envied the cool kids, and I wanted to be one of them.” This prompted criesthat racial hatred was to blame for Rodger’s crime.One of Rodger’s victims, twenty-year-old Bianca de Kock, who survived fivegunshots, told how he wore a “smirky, grimacy smile” as he gunned down hersorority sisters. “He wanted to do this, he looked happy about it,” she told thenews media.Elliot Rodger was only the latest in a string of young men involved in shootingincidents. The corporate mass media always blames firearms for the shootings.But a look at history reveals that prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act, any personcould legally own all sorts of weapons, including machine guns. Yet these gunsprompted no school shootings.What the media fails to mention is the common denominator in so many of theseshootings: psychiatric drugs. Of course, gunmakers, unlike pharmaceuticalcompanies, do not spend millions on advertising. Few in the media have detailedthe fact that Rodger was being treated for psychological and psychiatric issues.In his own words, he said, “I will quickly swallow all of the Xanax and Vicodinpills I have left . . .” Is it not possible that Rodger’s mental illness, andthe psychiatric drugs with which he was being treated, are at least partiallyresponsible for his heinous deeds?As Rodger’s story illustrates, drugs may play a significant role in the recentspate of senseless public shootings, though in this case the drugs are legal.And as we see from Rodger’s case, these drugs are being prescribed to more andmore young people, frequently under the age of eighteen. When dangerouspsychiatric medications are mixed with the typical tensions of adolescent life,the results can be deadly.Rather than continually send heartfelt condolences to the families of thevictims, it is time for lawmakers to investigate the connection betweenprescription psychiatric drugs and violence. In nearly every school shooting,including the 1999 tragedy at Columbine High School, the shooters weremedicated.In July 2012, James Holmes walked into a midnight showing of a Batman movie inAurora, Colorado, and killed twelve people, wounding fifty-eight others. TheDenver Post reported Holmes was taking a generic form of the drug Zoloft. Thefact that Seung-Hui Cho, who killed thirty-two persons at Virginia Tech in April2007, had been undergoing psychological counseling involving the use ofprescription psychoactive drugs was rarely mentioned in the mass media. In fact,the prescription drug use of other mass murderers remains unclear becauseauthorities have sealed their medical records from the public. It is known thatArmy Specialist Ivan Lopez, who killed four persons including himself in anApril 2014 shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, was being treated with Ambien andother medication for anxiety and depression. Likewise, Aaron Alexis, who killedtwelve persons at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, was being treated with theantidepressant Trazadone.Sometimes the psychiatric drugs themselves are a factor as withdrawal fromselective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be particularly unpleasant.British psychiatrist Dr. David Healy notes that “almost all the school shootersthat we know of have either been on or using these drugs or in withdrawal fromthem,” a condition called SSRI discontinuation syndrome. While certain states ofdepression undoubtedly can be soothed by such SSRIs as Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft,Effexor, and others, Dr. Healy warned, “You can become emotionally numb when yougo on these drugs. That means you can do things you wouldn’t normallycontemplate doing.”The website SSRI Stories.org has begun to explore the potentially deadly effectsof these drugs. It offers a collection of more than five thousand accounts frompopular media and scientific journals in which prescription drugs wereassociated with a variety of deviant acts, many of them violent. “Withdrawal,especially abrupt withdrawal, from any of these medications can cause severeneuropsychiatric and physical symptoms,” warned a post on this site. “Withdrawalis sometimes more severe than the original symptoms or problems.”Several stories recounted on the site involved the violent behavior of patientswho had gone off their medication. One example was the tragedy ofthirty-five-year-old Derek Ward, who in October 2014 decapitated his mother,Pat, who had scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist in two days toreplenish her son’s SSRI medications. Ward, who according to his family had beenoff his medications only four days, later died when he threw himself in front ofa train.Even the government has acknowledged the dangers of SSRI drugs. In 2004, the FDAordered pharmacies to provide to all parents or guardians for youngsterseighteen and under an “Antidepressant Patient Medication Guide,” which stated inpart, “Call healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has anyof the following symptoms: Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent and actingon dangerous impulses . . . Never stop an antidepressant medicine without firsttalking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenlycan cause other symptoms.”There are about twenty-five million Americans on SSRI drugs. If only one-tenthof one percent react violently to the drugs, that’s still twenty-five thousandpotential mass murderers.Of greatest concern is the frequency with which these drugs are beingprescribed. Early on, only severe cases of depression or anxiety were thought towarrant psychiatric drugs. But today virtually any school kid may be subject todrug treatment, sometimes even against their will or their parents’ knowledge.One such example is Chelsea Rhoades, a 15-year-old sophomore at Penn High Schoolin Mishawaka, Indiana, who was pulled out of her classroom and told to sign aform, then was administered a TeenScreen psychological assessment test. The testincluded such questions as: “Have you had trouble sleeping, that is, troublefalling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early? Have you had less energythan you usually do? Has doing even little things made you feel really tired?Has it often been hard for you to make up your mind or to make decisions? Haveyou often had trouble keeping your mind on your schoolwork/work or other things?Have you often felt grouchy or irritable and often in a bad mood, when evenlittle things would make you mad? Have you gained a lot of weight, more thanjust a few pounds? Have you lost weight, more than just a few pounds?”Like many teen students, Chelsea did as she was told and never asked if the testwas voluntary. After the test, she was told she suffered from “ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder for cleaning and social anxiety disorder.” She was told toseek medical treatment.Dr. Julian Whitaker, author and founder of the Whitaker Wellness Institute inNewport Beach, California, asked, “Since when are issues with sleeping, energy,and feeling tired indicative of a mental illness? What kid—or adult for thatmatter—hasn’t at one time or another in the last four weeks felt indecisive,unfocused, grouchy, or irritable? And the questions about weight are just plainnuts. Adolescents are expected to have growth spurts!”But other test questions were less anodyne. They included “Have you thoughtseriously about killing yourself? Have you tried to kill yourself in the lastfour weeks? Have you ever in your whole life tried to kill yourself or made asuicide attempt?” As Dr. Whitaker remarked, “One thing [is] for certain, ifthey’d never given [any] thought [to] suicide, they will now.”The girl’s parents, Michael and Teresa Rhoades, filed suit against the schoolclaiming their parental rights were violated since the school administered thepsychological test without their permission, did not clearly state the test wasvoluntary, and made a diagnosis based on Chelsea’s test answers. Representativesof the school, arguing the TeenScreen test was optional and confidential, movedfor a summary judgment from U.S. District Court for the Northern District ofIndiana, expecting to win as they usually do. However, noting that the schoolhad not made clear that the test was voluntary and had not even filled in thename of any person or persons to whom the questions were to be referred, thecourt ruled in the parents’ favor. This particular case was a victory forparents, privacy, and common sense, but many other children in U.S. schools havenot been so lucky.A 2014 study based on information from the CDC’s National Center for HealthStatistics indicated that almost 11 percent of schoolchildren ages four toseventeen are now taking psychiatric drugs for emotional or behavioral problems.Many of these medications purport to treat attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), a condition in the past described simply as restlessness oracting out of boredom. Such medications disproportionately harm certain groupsof children. The study found that children from poorer families were more likelyto be medicated than their well-to-do peers, and that boys were more frequentlyprescribed psychiatric meds than girls.Yet the science behind the so-called ADHD epidemic is not well supported. Someresearchers, such as behavioral neurologist Richard Saul, do not even believethat ADHD exists. Noting that the number of adults taking a drug for ADHD hasincreased 53 percent between 2008 and 2012 and nearly doubled for young persons,Saul noted, “Today, the fifth edition of the DSM only requires one to exhibitfive of eighteen possible symptoms to qualify for an ADHD diagnosis. If youhaven’t seen the list, look it up. It will probably bother you. How many of uscan claim that we have difficulty with organization or a tendency to losethings; that we are frequently forgetful or distracted or fail to pay closeattention to details? Under these subjective criteria, the entire U.S.population could potentially qualify. We’ve all had these moments, and inmoderate amounts they’re a normal part of the human condition.”As more than twenty conditions can lead to symptoms similar to ADHD, attentiondeficient hyperactivity disorder has too often become a diagnosis of choice thatsaves time for doctors and generates huge profits for the drug corporations.Even more disturbing is the number of very young children who are beingprescribed these medications. According to a report by the CDC, more than tenthousand American toddlers on Medicaid were being medicated for maladies outsideestablished pediatric guidelines, and an additional four thousand childrencovered under private insurance plans were being medicated.“It’s absolutely shocking, and it shouldn’t be happening,” said a children’smental health consultant to the Carter Center. “People are just feeling aroundin the dark. We obviously don’t have our act together for little children,”commented Anita Zervigon-Hakes, a consultant to the Carter Center in Atlanta,where the report on children was presented in May 2014.Dr. Susanna N. Visser, who oversaw the CDC’s ADHD research, agreed. “Families oftoddlers with behavioral problems are coming to the doctor’s office for help,and the help they’re getting too often is a prescription for a Class IIcontrolled substance, which has not been established as safe for that young of achild. It puts these children and their developing minds at risk, and theirhealth is at risk,” warned Dr. Visser.Dr. Nancy Rappaport, a child psychiatrist and director of school-based programsat the Cambridge Health Alliance outside Boston, specializes in underprivilegedyouth, many coming from broken homes. “In acting out and being hard to control,they’re signaling the chaos in their environment,” she remarked. “Of course onlysome homes are like this—but if you have a family with domestic violence, drugor alcohol abuse or a parent neglecting a two-year-old, the kid might lookimpulsive or aggressive. And the parent might just want a quick fix, and theeasiest thing to do is medicate. It’s a travesty.”Where once a daydreaming child was simply chastised by a teacher who orderedthem to stay with the rest of the class, today they are sent to the schoolnurse, who, more often than not, refers them to a psychologist inclined toprescribe medications such as Ritalin and Adderall. These drugs can calm achild’s hyperactivity, but also have their share of serious potential sideeffects, including growth suppression, insomnia, and hallucinations.It’s easy to see why it might not be the best idea to cause young children toexperience these effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines do notcover children below the age of four, because the academy considershyperactivity developmentally appropriate for toddlers and understands that moretime is needed to see if a disorder is truly present.Despite this policy, one of the worst offenders in this unprecedented druggingof youth is Medicaid. As reported by the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) in2013, the number of children—many of them under the age of three—on Medicaid whoare taking antipsychotic drugs has tripled in just ten years. Between 1999 and2008, the amount Medicaid spends on antipsychotic drugs more than doubled. Theprogram currently spends $3.8 billion annually on antipsychotics, more than itspends on any other class of drugs.A spokesperson for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission defended suchdrugging by claiming the prescriptions were to help infants “with discomfort.”Many of the antipsychotics used today are second- and third-generationantipsychotics, with bizarre names such as Abilify (the nation’s top-sellingprescription drug), Risperdal, Seroquel, and Zyprexa. These drugs have replacedfirst-generation antipsychotics such as Haldol and Thorazine, though the sideeffects remain. As the ANH notes, “Keep in mind that common side effects for onecommon psychiatric medication include a shuffling walk, drooling, rapid weightgain, and the inability to speak.” This list would give any adult pause; thefact that these drugs are being prescribed to infants is unconscionable.And the financial repercussions are equally damning. Due to the large number ofpeople receiving antipsychotics who are on Medicaid, a full 70 percent of thetotal spent on these drugs in the U.S. is footed by the taxpayers. “This isnothing less than crony capitalism in action,” noted the ANH. “Pharmaceuticalcompanies donate heavily to political campaigns, and legislators pass laws thatcompensate them in spades for the amount donated. Those who pay the real priceare the poor and powerless.” The organization added that there is no corporateincentive for such essentials as nutrition, exercise, and love, as thesepursuits cannot be patented.In addition to the mind-warping aspects of psychiatric drugs, recent studiesshow that memories can now be both created and erased through the use of drugsand the use of light to stimulate certain sections of the brain. Neuroscientistsat the University of California, San Diego, found that by using light toactivate neurons in the brains of rats, they were able to activate certainproteins that induced false memories. Research team leader Roberto Malinowreported, “We can make a memory of something that the animal never experiencedbefore.” He added, “We were playing with memory like a yo-yo,” If this can bedone in rats, it can be done in humans.Some researchers believe it is entirely possible that the globalists even noware attempting to manipulate the minds of American citizens by funding researchsuch as that in San Diego as well as supporting legislation for mass mentalanalysis. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force has urged routine screeningfor all American teenagers for depression, and politicians were ready to step upto the plate. Congress has periodically introduced legislation proposingwidespread mental health screening.In 2007, legislation was introduced entitled the Postpartum Mood DisordersPrevention Act, which called for the mental screening of mothers for signs ofdepression. Such mandatory screening for depression may soon become state law inIllinois, and similar legislation has already been adopted or at leastintroduced in several other states. In 2009, this mass screening scheme wasproposed again in the form of the Melanie Blocker-Stokes Mom’s Opportunity toAccess Health, Education, Research, and Support for Postpartum Depression Act of2009, otherwise known simply as the Mother’s Act. This law was reintroduced intoboth bodies of the new Congress in January 2009, after the 2007 bill died in theSenate.Critics of the Mother’s Act, fearful that the legislation would mandate evenfurther drugging of both mothers and infants, were incensed to learn that thesame provisions were contained within President Obama’s 2010 Affordable CareAct.In an article entitled “Branding Pregnancy as a Mental Illness,” Byron Richardsnoted, “The Mother’s Act has the net effect of reclassifying the natural processof pregnancy and birth as a mental disorder that requires the use of unprovenand extremely dangerous psychotropic medications (which can also easily harm thechild). The bill was obviously written by the Big Pharma lobby and its passageinto law would be considered laughable except that it is actually happening.”Investigative journalist Evelyn Pringle, writing for the political newsletterCounterpunch, wrote, “The true goal of the promoters of this act is to transformwomen of child bearing age into life-long consumers of psychiatric treatment byscreening women for a whole list of ‘mood’ and ‘anxiety’ disorders and notsimply postpartum depression. Enough cannot be said about the ability of anyonewith a white coat and a medical title to convince vulnerable pregnant women andnew mothers that the thoughts and feelings they experience on any given daymight be abnormal.”One can clearly see the susceptibility to drug abuse by new mothers whose mentalequilibrium is already shaky because of the rigors of childbirth, and especiallyfirst-time mothers concerned over the health of both their child and themselves.Many people feel the drugs and vaccines being administered to children have notbeen fully tested or guaranteed safe. They feel children are being used asguinea pigs for Big Pharma and that such indiscriminate drugging amounts tonothing less than chemical child abuse.Health Ranger Mike Adams pondered, “I often wonder when the rest of the countrywill wake up and notice that the mass-drugging of our nation’s children has gonetoo far. Why isn’t the mainstream media giving this front-page coverage? Whyaren’t lawmakers demanding an end to the chemical abuse of our children? Whyisn’t the FDA halting these trials on toddlers out of plain decency? You alreadyknow the answer: Because they’re all making money from this chemical assault onour nation’s children. The doctors, hospitals, drug companies, psychiatrists andmainstream media all profit handsomely from the sales of mind-altering drugs tochildren. Ethics will never get in the way of old-fashioned greed.” Suchdrugging of future generations also advances the globalists’ goal of societalcontrol.Adams and many other concerned parents say children should be given moresunshine, playtime, and access to nature rather than drugs. They say this is thehistorically proven and commonsense approach to producing balanced, healthychildren.“But psychiatry has no common sense,” argued Adams, “and no one in the industrydares mention that most so-called mental disorders are really just caused bynutritional imbalances. Because to admit to the truth about the mental health ofchildren would be to render their careers irrelevant.”The ultimate issue is deciding where to draw the line on which behaviors arenormal and which require some sort of intervention. Bipolar disorder, apsychiatric diagnosis describing persons, usually children, who display a widerange of emotions, from exuberant highs to depressing lows, is seen by some asmerely the normal ups and downs of the growth process. Critics are quick to notethat there is no scientific means to confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.In a 2009 interview in Psychology Today, David Healy, former secretary of theBritish Association for Psychopharmacology and author of Mania, a book onbipolar disorder, acknowledged that this disorder is somewhat of a mythicalentity. “The problems that currently are grouped under the heading ‘bipolardisorder’ are akin to problems that, in the 1960s and 1970s, would have beencalled ‘anxiety’ and treated with tranquilizers or, during the 1990s, would havebeen labeled ‘depression’ and treated with antidepressants,” he said.Healy described claims that imbalances of enzymes such as serotonin (agastrointestinal neurotransmitter enzyme believed to promote feelings ofwell-being) to explain mood swings as unsubstantiated “biobabble.” “What’sastonishing is how quickly these terms were taken up by popular culture, and howwidely, with so many people now routinely referring to their serotonin levelsbeing out of whack when they are feeling wrong or unwell,” he said. Some feel itis fortunate there were no synthetic psychiatric drugs available to dull themoods of the master artist Vincent van Gogh, who some historians believesuffered from bipolar disorder.And even for those who lack van Gogh’s genius but exhibit some behavioralissues, the drugs they are being prescribed are leading to disastrous effects. A2014 study by researchers from the Bloomberg School of Public Health found thatprenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated withautism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delays (DD) in boys. Nearly onethousand mother-child pairs were included in the population-based case-controlstudy, which also found that young boys were more likely to be affected by thedevelopment problems than girls. “We found prenatal SSRI exposure was nearlythree times as likely in boys with ASD relative to typical development, with thegreatest risk when exposure took place during the first trimester,” reported Dr.Li-Ching Lee, Ph.D., a psychiatric epidemiologist in Bloomberg’s Department ofEpidemiology. This research illustrates the challenge for women and theirphysicians to balance the risks versus the benefits of taking SSRI medications.With everyone from infants to senior citizens being drugged for both real andimagined mental disorders, it is troubling to note that one group in particularhas been targeted for selective drugging—our military service personnel."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-17]DRUGGING THE MILITARY [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-17]EACH MEMORIAL DAY, THE UNITED STATES IS INUNDATED WITH patriotic zeal: wardocumentaries, ceremonies, and speeches honor the men and women of the militaryservices. Politicians and corporations expound on their support for ourveterans.Yet, contrary to all this flag-waving, not to mention President Obama’s pledgethat he “will not stand” for mistreatment of veterans on his watch, the lives ofvets are fraught with inattention and insecurity, even harassment. Large numbersof vets are impoverished, unemployed, struggling with depression, andexperiencing substandard treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).One third of all homeless Americans are veterans. And these days, we can add onemore troubling fact to this list: many military veterans are being prescribedquestionable drugs.In order to understand the prescription drug scandal as it relates to themilitary, we must first look at the broader health care issues facing manyveterans. First of all, many of them lack access to even basic medical services.In mid-2014, an audit of 731 medical facilities by the VA revealed that morethan fifty-seven thousand new patients had been waiting more than ninety daysfor an initial appointment. About sixty-four thousand who had been enrolled inthe system for up to a decade still had not seen a doctor.The long delays veterans face exacerbate many existing problems, and in somecases even lead to death. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Jessie Jane Duff, a member ofthe organizing committee at Concerned Veterans for America, said that while thegovernment has admitted to about forty deaths in the Phoenix area, with dozensmore facilities are under investigation, the real number is much higher.“Let’s go to the backlog that they had. Fifty-three veterans died a day justwaiting on their benefits in 2011,” said Duff. “The VA itself has those numbers.We’re talking about egregious mismanagement, a culture of corruption that wasallowing all these executives to give the impression that they had fourteen daysof waiting time, not months and months of waiting time, so they could getbonuses. So I expect it will be several hundred, if not thousands.”She gave an example of veterans in Albuquerque suffering from such ailments asgangrene, heart disease, and brain tumors. Yet these veterans were forced towait more than four months for treatment. Even for basic treatments, taken forgranted by many Americans, veterans are forced to jump through hoops to receivecare. Duff reported that in Harlingen, Texas, the VA decided that servicemen hadto come back for three separate screenings before they qualified for acolonoscopy.“What disappoints me the most out of this is that it was deliberate. I used tothink it was just mismanagement. I’ve been reporting on mismanagement for thepast year. Now I realize it was all deliberate and it was all in the name of analmighty dollar,” said Duff. “I’m so shocked and saddened to know thatexecutives at the highest level were training their employees to hide numbers,training their employees to make it look like veterans were only waitingfourteen days.”Duff decried efforts to throw more tax dollars at the VA, stating, “They have a$150 billion budget. They requested $160 billion for the next fiscal year.They’ve never been denied anything from the Senate or the House, as far as theirbudget goes.” In Phoenix, a mere 39 percent of this budget goes for actualmedical costs, she reported, with 52 percent going for administrative costs,including the purchase of expensive office furniture. She added another $6million was spent on a sparsely attended national conference in Orlando,Florida.“They’ve wasted thousands and thousands and millions of dollars. The money issimply being mismanaged,” declared Duff.Further revelations have unmasked the full extent of mismanagement at the VA. In2014, the scheduling clerk at the Phoenix VA told CNN that for the better partof a year she was ordered by superiors to manage a “secret waiting list” ofthose vets seeking medical attention, and would remove the “deceased” notice ondead patients to conceal the number of veterans who died while awaitingtreatment.“What makes the VA scandal different is not only that it affected people attheir most desperate moment of need—and continues to affect them at subparfacilities,” wrote Slate’s chief political correspondent John Dickerson. “It’salso a failure of one of the most basic transactions government is supposed toperform—keeping a promise to those who were asked to protect our very form ofgovernment. The growing scandal points out more than just incompetence. When thewait times were long and those promises were being broken to veterans,administrators then lied about it. It appears this was true across the country.”John Whitehead, author of A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American PoliceState, notes the U.S. government has been breaking its promises to the Americanpeople for a long time now, even as service personnel pledge to uphold anddefend the Constitution. “Yet if the government won’t abide by its commitment torespect our constitutional rights to be free from government surveillance andcensorship, if it completely tramples on our right to due process and fairhearings, and routinely denies us protection from roadside strip searches andmilitarized police, why should anyone expect the government to treat ournation’s veterans with respect and dignity?” he asked.Former presidential candidate Ron Paul saw the scandal in even grander terms.“We should remember that though the VA’s alleged abuse and neglect of U.S.veterans is scandalous, the worse abuse comes from a president and a compliantCongress that send the U.S. military to cause harm and be harmed overseas inundeclared, unnecessary, and illegal interventions.”In mid-2014, the uproar over the VA scandal prompted the resignation of VeteransAffairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and an unusual bipartisan proposal fromCongress. Vermont independent senator Bernie Sanders and Arizona Republicansenator John McCain suggested legislation to correct the VA problems. Thebipartisan bill would provide for twenty-six new VA medical facilities ineighteen states and would provide $500 million to hire more VA doctors andnurses. In a two-year trial project under this bill, veterans would be allowedto seek private medical help if they experienced long wait times or lived morethan forty miles from a VA facility.But the legislation did little to counteract many other issues with the program:long waiting times and inferior medical treatment are not the only concerns. Asfar back as 2009, the FBI launched Operation Vigilant Eagle, a program warningof “militia/sovereign-citizen extremist groups,” to include veterans from Iraqand Afghanistan. As a result of the operation, many vets have been targeted forsurveillance, censored, threatened with incarceration or involuntary commitment,labeled as extremists and/or mentally ill, and stripped of their SecondAmendment rights. There have been instances of veterans having weaponsconfiscated after answering yes on questionnaires asking if they own firearms.Government policy characterizes veterans as potential domestic terroristsbecause they might be “disgruntled, disillusioned or suffering from thepsychological effects of war.”This demonization of vets has resulted in inappropriate uses of force on thepart of many police departments. One example is the case of Jose Guerena, aMarine who served two tours in Iraq. Guerena was killed in 2011 after an ArizonaSWAT team kicked open the door of his home during a mistaken drug raid andopened fire. Guerena had no prior criminal record and the police subsequentlyfound nothing illegal in his home.In 2014, John Edward Chesney, a sixty-two-year-old Vietnam veteran, was alsokilled by a SWAT team, which responded to a call that the army veteran wasstanding in his apartment window waving what looked like a semiautomatic rifle.Instead of attempting to make contact with the man, or figure out what he washolding, SWAT officers fired twelve rounds into Chesney’s apartment window. Itturned out that the gun Chesney was pointing was a “realistic-looking mockassault rifle.” In a situation similar to Chesney’s, though with a lessdisastrous conclusion, another Iraq war veteran, twenty-five-year-old RamonHooks, was arrested and charged with “criminal mischief” after a HomelandSecurity agent reported him as an active shooter, even though Hooks was merelypracticing with a pellet gun.The list goes on. In 2012, Brandon Raub, a twenty-six-year-old decorated Marine,was arrested by government agents and held against his will in a psychiatricward for expressing his views on government corruption on Facebook. The crimefor which the vet was isolated from his family, friends, and attorneys seemed tobe that he held “conspiratorial” views about the government.Against the background of this widespread mistreatment of veterans, it’s nosurprise that when it comes to medication and drugs, they face additionalproblems. Many of these medications and treatments make veterans’ healthproblems after returning home even worse. The vaccines routinely administered toU.S. troops are one issue of concern, in particular the fact that these vaccinescontain squalene. Squalene is an organic compound originally derived from sharkliver oil and used as an adjuvant, or additive, to immunization vaccines. An oilmolecule native to the body, squalene is found in trace amounts throughout aperson’s nervous system and brain. What differentiates “good” from “bad”squalene is the route by which it enters your body. Injection is an abnormalentry route, which causes the immune system to attack all the squalene in yourbody, not just the vaccine adjuvant.For years, the Department of Defense denied the presence of squalene in theanthrax vaccine. However, the FDA has tested several samples of the vaccine andfound the compound present in varying levels. This late admission irritated thelate Washington State representative Jack Metcalf, who complained, “We’ve beentold for three years there is no squalene in the anthrax vaccine, then suddenlywe are told, ‘Oh yes, it’s there, but it’s no big deal: it’s everywhere.’”Citing the Military Vaccine Resource Directory website, Dr. Anders BruunLaursen, who has written extensively on vaccines in general and squalene inparticular, noted, “The average quantity of squalene injected into the U.S.soldiers abroad and at home in the anthrax vaccine during and after the Gulf Warwas 34.2 micrograms per billion micrograms of water. According to one study,this was the cause of the Gulf War syndrome in 25 percent of 697,000 U.S.personnel at home and abroad.”Dr. Laursen said squalene “in all probability was responsible for the Gulf Warsyndrome” and this has engendered “a deeply rooted mistrust in our politiciansand the vaccine producers’ motives and morals.”One vaccine allotment contained 10.68 milligrams of squalene per 0.5 milliliter,which corresponds to 2.136.0000 micrograms per billion micrograms of water; thisis one million times more squalene per dose than advised in the Military VaccineResource Directory. “There is [every] reason to believe that this will makepeople sick to a much higher extent . . . This appears murderous to me,” saidDr. Laursen.Professor Robert F. Garry confirmed these squalene levels in his testimonybefore the House Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs andInternational Relations in 2002. Garry was the first to discover the connectionbetween the Gulf War syndrome and squalene. Unsuccessful efforts have been madeto ban squalene from vaccines but controversy continues to rage.At a 2010 gathering of the American Rally for Personal Rights in Chicago,retired air force captain Richard Rovet, who also is a registered nurse, warnedthat squalene MF59 was forced on all servicemen beginning in 1999 via themandatory anthrax vaccine. He said the adjuvant caused many of his comrades tosuffer severe and permanent side effects. He said one of his close friends diedfrom it.“For the past sixty-four years, the United States Military and other agencieswithin our government have used our servicemen and women as test subjects,oftentimes in secret and without informed consent,” explained Captain Rovet.Rovet noted that in December 1994, the United States Senate released a reporttitled “Is Military Research Hazardous to a Veteran’s Health? Lessons SpanningHalf a Century,” which outlined the unethical use of servicemen and women astest subjects—human guinea pigs.Exposing soldiers to harm off the battlefield is nothing new. Some four hundredthousand U.S. soldiers suffered the effects of debilitating amounts of radiationduring nuclear bomb testing between 1945 and 1963. And the results of the PublicHealth Service’s infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments are well documented. Inthis experiment, which lasted between 1932 and 1972, nearly four hundred blackAmericans were studied for the effects of syphilis but never treated. Termed an“outrage” and “profoundly morally wrong,” President Bill Clinton publiclyapologized for the experiments in 1997.Although the current drugging of soldiers is less well documented, the resultsmay be even more devastating. As reporter Alex Jones put it, “The mass druggingof U.S. troops is one of the most underreported scandals of the modern era, withsoldiers not only being used as guinea pigs in a brave new world ofpharmacological experimentation, but also having their rights stripped as aresult.” Michael’s House, a Palm Springs drug treatment facility, reported thatsince 1999, more than seventeen thousand soldiers have been discharged from theU.S. military due to drug use. In that same time span, the number of failed drugtests in the air force has increased 82 percent, and in the army 37 percent.As the New York Times confirms, recent years have seen a significant increase instimulant use in the military, with annual spending on these drugs rising from$7.5 million in 2001 to $39 million in 2010. According to data provided byTricare Management Activity, which manages health care services for theDepartment of Defense, the number of Ritalin and Adderall prescriptions writtenfor active-duty service members increased by nearly 1,000 percent, jumping fromthree thousand to thirty-two thousand between 2007 and 2012.More prescriptions have meant more deaths, many of them self-inflicted. Between2001 and 2009, as the number of psychiatric drug prescriptions among activetroops rose 76 percent, the suicide rate increased more than 150 percent. “Thesesoaring statistics cannot be attributed to the horrors of war, as 85 percent ofmilitary suicide victims had never even seen combat,” noted the CitizensCommission on Human Rights (CCHR). “This suggests that the PTSD [post-traumaticstress disorder] diagnosis is being widely handed out to active-duty and vets tojustify putting more and more of them on cocktails of prescribed mind-alteringdrugs from which they may never recover.”In past years, war trauma, then called “shell shock,” was treated withcompassion, understanding, and love. But according to the CCHR and many others,today, the willingness to empathize with the warrior and listen to hisexperiences has been replaced by a psychiatric pop-a-pill quick-fix mentalitythat employs antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, sedatives, orantianxiety drugs that may produce harmful consequences.According to a report from Veterans for America, “U.S. troops are being forcedto take drugs like Prozac and Seroquel for anxiety and depression. Troops cannotrefuse to take the drugs without consequences from their superiors.”According to a Defense Department of Defense Directive in 2011 entitled, “DODPatient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in the Military Health System(MHS),” military personnel are entitled to informed consent for any treatmentand may refuse treatment. However, many times soldiers are led by suggestion orinnuendo to believe that they cannot refuse mental health treatment.But while there is no permissible enforced treatment for active-duty personnel,veterans may be threatened with losing benefits if they refuse psychiatrictreatments recommended by VA hospitals or clinics.According to some veterans groups, the unprovoked wars in the Middle East(recall that most of the 19 named hijackers of 2001 attacks were Saudi Arabians)have seen instances of resistance by U.S. troops to their superiors’ orders.Some military personnel are upset because they must bear the brunt of localvengeance in the wake of atrocities carried out by the growing number ofcivilian contractors who wear very much the same uniforms as servicemen but arepaid more than double their salaries. It has been claimed that sometimes patrolsdecline to carry out their “search and kill” missions and, instead, return totheir bases claiming they carried out their orders.There’s no doubt that post-traumatic stress disorder is a serious problem in themilitary, but it’s also apparent that the new and dangerous drugs beingprescribed to soldiers are only making the problem worse. Stimulants help troopsstay awake and alert but also contribute to PTSD. Such stimulants generatenorepinephrine, an adrenaline-type chemical, which can create vivid andlong-lasting traumatic memories. “Because norepinephrine enhances emotionalmemory, a soldier taking a stimulant medication, which releases norepinephrinein the brain, could be at higher risk of becoming fear-conditioned and gettingPTSD in the setting of trauma,” wrote Richard A. Friedman, a professor ofpsychiatry and director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill CornellMedical College.And many soldiers find it difficult to kick drug habits acquired with thesupport of the military when they return to civilian life. Often addicted toprescription medications, upon returning home, veterans are forced to visitpsychologists who diagnose them with mental disorders and continue to prescribethem drugs, often with tragic consequences.The case of Andrew White is just one example of the tragic consequences of theoveruse of psychotropic drugs among returning U.S. soldiers. White, atwenty-three-year-old veteran of the Iraq War, died in 2008 of an overdose ofSeroquel, Klonopin, and Paxil, all prescribed by VA doctors. The death wasdoubly painful for his parents, Stan and Shirley White, who had already losttheir oldest son, Bob, a paratrooper killed earlier in Afghanistan. The Whitesblamed Andrew’s death on overmedication while under the care of both governmentand private doctors.White’s mother said she was carefully administering Andrew’s daily medicationintake. Andrew’s father, Stan, remarked that the family now refers to the threedrugs Andrew had been taking as the “lethal cocktail.” Stan commented, “It’santidepressants, antipsychotics, and analgesics. It’s just overloading, and yourbody can’t take it.” His wife added, “He was taking exactly what the VA told himto take . . . He made that choice to trust the VA and that trust cost him hislife.”A spokesperson told ABC News that the VA investigated Andrew White’s death andconcluded his doctors had met “the community standards of care,” and so had donenothing wrong. Still, the army’s surgeon general‘s office admitted it wasworking toward better communication between soldiers, their families,commanders, and health care specialists.Andrew White is not the only soldier who has died from PTSD medications. Atleast three other war veterans died in their sleep within weeks of each other inthe same part of West Virginia in 2008. San Diego neurologist Dr. Fred Baughmanbecame intrigued by the unusual deaths. “Young men in their twenties don’t justdie in their sleep,” he reasoned. Despite no access to medical files, Baughmancompiled a list from news reports of some three hundred military deaths linkedto sudden heart attacks. The common thread between the hundreds of deaths wasthe use of antipsychotics and antidepressants, which, depending on type andquantity, are known to cause sudden cardiac arrest.When not causing physical harm, these drugs have also been connected to severeemotional distress, the very issue against which they allegedly protect. NorthCarolinians John and Mary Nahas found their son, Iraq War veteran Michael Nahas,bleeding in the bathtub from a suicide attempt. The Nahas believed his behaviorwas the result of a toxic blend of prescription drugs, including Oxycodone,Xanax, Percocet, Klonopin, Celexa, Lunesta, and Ambien. “We noticed a decline inhis personality from the drugs,” explained Mary. “They change cognition andbehavior. We noticed anger, [he] just couldn’t think straight.”In 2013, the Pentagon released a study of military suicides entitled “RiskFactors Associated with Suicide in Current and Former U.S. Military Personnel.”This study was based on current and former soldiers’ responses to a variety ofquestions. However, while the study concluded that mental health problems,including manic-depressive disorder, depression, and alcoholism, played a majorrole in military suicides, none of the questions specifically covered prescribedpsychiatric drugs. In fact, the words “drugs” and “medication” do not appear atall in study’s questionnaire.Soon Big Pharma may even offer a drug specifically tailored to PTSD. Researchersat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in conjunction with MassachusettsGeneral Hospital, are working on a vaccine to block ghrelin, a stomach hormoneproduced by the body in response to stress. They found that when injected withdrugs to block the excess production of ghrelin, rats appeared to have fewersymptoms associated with PTSD than those not given the drug. But another studyindicated that blocking the production and uptake of ghrelin might inhibit thebody’s ability to regulate energy balance and food intake, which could lead toobesity. Again, we see that these medications can have dangerous side effects.And it’s fair to ask whether another drug treatment is really needed. Some claimthis new drug, like many others, attempts to correct an underlying healthcondition by merely covering up its symptoms, rather than attacking the rootcause.In the United States of America’s death culture, drugs are a huge part of theproblem. In conjunction with the toxicity of many other aspects of Americanlife, they have contributed to numerous deaths and public health issues.CHANGING THE GAMEAMERICA MUST REVAMP BOTH THE LAWS AND CITIZENS’ ATTITUDES regarding drugs beforethe entire population is zombified by chemical substances. The only way themisuse of drugs can be effectively addressed is by identifying and addressingthe underlying causes of drug abuse: poverty, wealth inequality, andhopelessness. Obviously, harsh and discriminatory prosecution at the federallevel has proven ineffective. Instead, such an upheaval in thought and actionmust take place at the local level, for only at the local level can the suitableremedies for this problem be found.When faced with a medical problem, thoughtful citizens must not depend upon onlyone source of information. Seek second opinions from health authorities andstudy for yourself the evidence available in books and on the Internet. Theperson who cares most about your health is yourself. Too often, conventionalmedicine is based on outmoded training, misleading marketing, and the drive forprofits. Be wary of government-driven hysteria over potential pandemics as wellas government agencies that have proven more beholden to corporate intereststhan concerned for the well-being of the public. Keen attention must be given tolegal prescription drugs as well as the drugs we have deemed illegal.Individuals should educate themselves on the benefits of drugs, but also on thedangers of usage and the risk of abuse. Serious attention should be given topreventive measures such as nutrition, diet, and exercise, rather than simplythe possibility of chemical treatment.The question of vaccines especially requires serious consideration. While somevaccines have been proven effective against disease, the increasing use ofadulterants such as thimerasol and squalene makes many current vaccinesdangerous. Vaccines should be scheduled over a longer period of time to avoidthe medical issues associated with simultaneous vaccines. Public funds should gofor the study of vaccines by truly objective organizations, not by the vaccinemanufacturers. Laws protecting vaccine makers should be revoked and individualliability returned to those producing the drugs. Government protection agenciessuch as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Child Protective Services(CPS) must be reorganized to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interests.It is long past time that marijuana, an herb with no record of physical harm yetproven health benefits, be regulated rather than outlawed. Prohibition has ledto the prosecution of hundreds of thousands of otherwise lawful citizens, andhas proven no more successful than alcohol prohibition. Thousands of lives havebeen ruined and public funds wasted on these inequitable marijuana laws, whilecriminal enterprises have only expanded.The time has come to recognize psychiatric mind-altering drugs as the drivingforce behind the horrific rise of public shootings and the increasing suiciderates among teens and veterans. The corporate mass media, so dependent on drugadvertising, should shift the focus of its ire from guns to the drugs thatclearly cause both suicidal and homicidal tendencies. It would appear that theongoing agenda of government and corporate media concerning firearm fearmongering has more to do with disarming the population than protecting it.Like society in general, the military should look past the surface problem ofdrug use by its soldiers to the underlying causes. It is no wonder that troopssent to faraway locations to fight unnecessary wars for corporate interestsshould turn to drugs to relieve their pain. After being trained to kill andgiven indiscriminate amounts of mood-altering drugs while in service, they arethen largely abandoned and even branded as potential terrorists by their owngovernment when they return home. Once our troops are through defending truefreedom and liberty, they should find the dignity and respect they so deserve."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-19]DEADLY FOOD [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-19]AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, “YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT.” IF THIS IS true, it bodes illfor many Americans.Globalist-controlled corporations have turned our food poisonous. It is lacedwith sodium nitrate for color, the nonessential amino acid monosodium glutamate(MSG) for taste, and various chemicals to preserve shelf life. Processed foodhas been intentionally stripped of essential minerals, vitamins, and nutrientsin a globalist plot to promote disease and malnutrition. Some nutritionistsbelieve that this corporate-sponsored genocide from deadly food will ultimatelylead to large-scale social collapse.Many self-styled globalists make no secret that they believe the world issuffering from overpopulation and that a steep reduction of the planet’sinhabitants is necessary to ensure a future without hunger and civil unrest.“The food supply appears to be intentionally designed to end human life ratherthan nourish it,” claimed nutrition advocate Mike Adams. “After having nowanalyzed over one thousand foods, superfoods, vitamins, junk foods and popularbeverages for heavy metals and other substances at the Natural News ForensicFood Labs, I have arrived at a conclusion so alarming and urgent that it canonly be stated bluntly. Based on what I am seeing via atomic spectroscopyanalysis of all the dietary substances people are consuming on a daily basis, Imust now announce that the battle for humanity is nearly lost.”He stated that this adulteration of our food is not happenstance or simply amistake. “My lab has uncovered scientific proof that substances areintentionally formulated into dietary products to drive consumers mentallyinsane [emphasis in the original] while causing widespread infertility, organdamage, and a loss of any ability to engage in rational, conscious thinking,”wrote Adams. “These toxic substances are being found across the entire foodsupply including in conventional foods, organic foods, ‘natural’ products, anddietary supplements.”Adams said such intentional formulations go far beyond the contamination offoods with heavy metals and include the intentional inclusion of toxicsubstances in products for mass consumption. “The result is what you seeunfolding around you right now: mass insanity, incredible escalations ofcriminality among political operatives, clinical insanity among an increasingnumber of mainstream media writers and reporters, widespread infertility inyoung couples, skyrocketing rates of kidney failure and dialysis patients, plusa near total loss of rational thinking among the voting masses,” he said.Adams and others argue that widespread food poisoning may cause the collapse ofa capable workforce, the rise of masses dependent on government for survival,the collapse of free democracies due to the cognitive deficiencies of the votingmasses, an exploding prison population and the rise of for-profit corporateprison systems, and even the near complete collapse of any ability of thenews-consuming public to parse and comprehend the most basic information such asnational debt figures.An estimated one in three Americans today is obese. In addition to sugaryprocessed foods lacking in nutrients, researchers in recent years have foundthat a notable cause of this national weight gain is due to declining physicalactivity in the workplace.While diet, lifestyle, and genetics all play a role in the rise of obesity, a2011 study published in the journal of the Public Library of Science (PLOS),reported that jobs requiring moderate physical activity accounted for 50 percentof the labor market in 1960. By 2012, this number had dropped to just 20percent. The remaining 80 percent of jobs are sedentary or require only lightactivity, accounting for an average decline of 120 to 140 calories a day inphysical activity, which closely matched the population weight gain in recentyears. These findings pose a challenge to employers to heighten workplace healthinitiatives and pay more attention to physical activity at work.According to a report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), theongoing conversion of corn crops to ethanol has contributed to a doubling inglobal food prices since 2005. Corn forms the basis for everything fromhigh-fructose corn syrup and cereal to feed for livestock. Dr. Yaneer Bar-Yam,founding president of the NECSI, said there was a link between global food-priceincreases associated with the corn-to-ethanol conversion and the violence in theMiddle East and North Africa known as the Arab Spring.He said the amount of corn used to produce one gallon of ethanol fuel could feedone person for a day, and the U.S. diversion of corn for ethanol could feed asmany as 570 million people worldwide annually. “When you’re pulling into the gasstation and you’re filling your tank with gas, 10 percent of what you’re puttinginto the tank is food. It could be eaten by people instead,” said Bar-Yam.Fed Up, a 2014 documentary, revealed more sobering facts about the U.S. foodindustry. Within two decades, the documentary predicts, more than 95 percent ofall Americans will be overweight or obese, and one out of every three Americanswill have diabetes by 2050. The film pointed out that 80 percent of all fooditems sold in America have added sugar. This greatly contributes to the epidemicof obesity.One would think that such terrifying projections would spur some sort oflegislative reform. Yet a corporation-controlled Congress has been unwilling tomake the necessary changes. In November 2011, House Republicans, spurred on bythe food corporations that supply the nation’s school cafeterias, produced aspending bill barring the USDA from changing its nutritional guidelines forschool lunches. The proposed changes would have required more green vegetablesand less sodium and sugar. Instead, the bill that passed has such absurdities asa provision classifying tomato paste on pizzas as a vegetable, although tomatoesare actually a fruit.But the health concerns go beyond pizza. Giant food corporations sell processedfood designed to keep consumers addicted to their products, not to keep themnourished. The food industry is no different from any other commercialenterprise—their products and marketing are geared toward maximizing profitsrather than benefiting humankind. Food products chemically processed withrefined ingredients or artificial substances are deliberately designed to bedeficient in nutrients, which leaves consumers craving more and more of theproducts.And the evidence is clear that these processed foods are responsible for deadlyconditions such as diabetes and heart disease. One of the main contributingfactors to such illnesses is sugar, which is as addictive and harmful as manyillicit drugs. In her book Suicide by Sugar: A Startling Look at Our #1 NationalAddiction, author Nancy Appleton pointed out that sugar can suppress the immunesystem, elevate glucose, heighten insulin responses, cause hyperactivity andanxiety, and raise triglyceride levels. It has been noted that the obesityepidemic in the U.S. generally began about 1977, the same year that the firstdietary guidelines for Americans were published. These dietary guidelinesincluded restrictions on fat, while largely giving carbohydrates and sugars afree pass. The tremendous health risks posed by excessive carbohydrateconsumption are now clear.In America, even natural fruit juices contain almost as much sugar as softdrinks, and the increased use of sugar has resulted in debilitating effects onboth mind and body.Processed foods tend to be unhealthy because they include high levels of sugar,or even worse, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a synthesized sweetener commonlyfound in breads, cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soft drinks,soups, and condiments. HFCS has been linked to the world’s leading killers—heartdisease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer—and activates the same areas in the brainas highly addictive drugs like cocaine. A 2007 Rutgers University study comparedHFCS sodas with those sweetened with traditional sugar (sucrose) and found theHFCS drinks contained up to ten times more harmful carbonyl compounds—substancespreviously linked to serious health complications in diabetics.In an effort to increase sales, food manufacturers engineer processed foods thatare sweet, salty, and fatty, all flavors the body naturally craves. But whilethe taste is there, the nutrition and fiber are not, resulting in what has beencalled the “food reward hypothesis of obesity.”It is the globalist bankers and owners of the large multinational foodcorporations who profit from a sugar-addicted and sedated population. They areachieving their goal of population reduction while profiting from the increasingnumber of people in their health care industry.As Kris Gunnars explains, “Food manufacturers spend massive amounts of resourceson making their foods as ‘rewarding’ as possible to the brain, which leads tooverconsumption . . . Some people can literally become addicted [emphasis in theoriginal] to this stuff and completely lose control over their consumption.”Though rarely discussed by the mass media, food addiction, in which brainbiochemistry is altered by eating processed foods, is the primary reason why somany people are unable to stop unhealthy eating habits.Gunnars also points out that while controversy rages over how many carbohydrateswe should consume, too few nutrition pundits are distinguishing between thedifferent types of carbohydrates. “The carbohydrates you find in processed foodsare usually refined, ‘simple’ carbohydrates. These lead to rapid spikes in bloodsugar and insulin levels and cause negative health effects.” He even warnedagainst some “whole grain” products, stating, “These are usually whole grainsthat have been pulverized into very fine flour and are just as harmful as theirrefined counterparts.”Consumption of refined carbohydrates can have disastrous effects on our generalhealth. A 2010 Food & Nutrition Research study showed participants who ate aprocessed food sandwich (white bread and artificial cheese) absorbed only halfas many calories as those who ate a whole food sandwich (multigrain bread andcheddar cheese).Many processed foods also contain refined seed and vegetable oils, which areoften hydrogenated. According to numerous scientific studies, people who consumelarge amounts of these oils have a significantly increased risk of heartdisease, the most common cause of death in Western countries. Instead, healthyconsumers should be replacing processed oils and trans fats with natural fatssuch as olive oil.When we’re not creating our own harmful foods products, we’re adulteratingexisting natural foods. Beef is a staple of the American diet. Despite the factthat many Americans eat beef several times a week, most have no idea that thefeedlot cows they’re consuming subsist on a diet of garbage and waste products.Cattle are often fed “poultry litter,” the agriculture industry’s term for thewaste picked off the floors of chicken cages. Consisting of feces, feathers, anduneaten chicken feed, a typical sample of poultry litter may also containantibiotics, heavy metals, disease-causing bacteria, and even rodent carcasses,according to Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes ConsumerReports.It is not just cows and chickens that are being fed poop. A greater and greaterpercentage of the seafood eaten by Americans—currently 35 percent—is sourcedfrom Asia, and these shipments are frequently contaminated. The FDA, ostensiblythe barrier between contaminated food products and the U.S. market, admits thatit inspects only about 2.7 percent of imported food. Since 2007, FDA inspectors,despite the tiny percentage they see, have rejected 1,380 loads of seafood fromVietnam for filth and salmonella and 820 shipments from China.In 2012, the FDA in effect barred Moon Fishery (India) Pvt. Ltd. from importingfish to the USA because of contamination and unsanitary conditions at its plant.But before instituting the ban, a salmonella outbreak in twenty-eight states hadsickened hundreds of Americans. Considering such numbers and events such as thetardy fishery ban, it is apparent that the FDA either cannot, or will not,provide adequate oversight protection of the public’s food.With so many food products tarnished by toxic compounds or grown in disgustingconditions, more and more grocery shoppers today are turning to organic foods.Organic food and fiber sales in 2013 grew to $35 billion, an increase of 11.5percent from 2012. Even large chains, such as Walmart and Target, have increasedtheir offering of organic products.“Organic is booming, and the mainstream acceptance of organic products isdriving it,” said Steve Crider, a spokesman for Amy’s Kitchen, aCalifornia-based organic and natural food maker. “We are coming into the secondgeneration of organic consumers: the kids who were raised on this stuff by theirmoms. They get it about food and sustainability and organic and local. They arepart of the drivers of this.”However, there are many problems even with organic food. This is partly becauseit has become increasingly easy for a food to be certified organic. Much as some“whole grain” products have become just as unhealthy as their refinedcounterparts, the term “organic” just doesn’t mean much anymore. Regulatorscontinually water down the requirements to gain the much-coveted seal ofapproval from the USDA, making it hard for consumers to discern which productsare actually grown under organic conditions.The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), which determines which products arecertified organic, originally operated under “sunset” provisions stipulatingthat organic products using nonorganic materials be dropped after five yearsunless renewed by a two-thirds vote of the board. But in 2013, a rule changereversed this process, keeping certification for these products in place unlessa two-thirds vote removes it. Yet given the makeup of the NOSB, which is stockedwith food industry reps seeking to sell more of their dubiously “organic”products, any vote to rescind organic status is exceedingly unlikely. Thispolicy change means that consumers will find it more difficult than ever todetermine which products are truly free of harmful ingredients.Quality Assurance International (QAI) is North America’s largest for-profitorganic certifier and typifies the work of nearly one hundred such certifyingfirms whose job it is to inspect producers, processors, handlers, and retailersseeking the “certified organic” stamp in order to assure they follow organicstandards. These standards include verification that irradiation, sewage,synthetic fertilizers, prohibited pesticides, and genetically modified organismsare not used; that antibiotics or growth hormones are not used on animals; thatproducts have 95 percent or more certified organic content.Operating worldwide, QAI literature states “QAI’s programs verify organicintegrity at each link of the production chain.” But critics say QAI and othersmay be loosely interpreting these standards, allowing some companies to bend, ifnot break, the rules.For example, according to Mark Kastel, cofounder of the Wisconsin-based organicwatchdog group the Cornucopia Institute, many large dairy operations, dubbed“factory farms,” bend the rules by confining thousands of cows in feedlotlikeconditions. Cornucopia charges that QAI, which certifies milk from Dean Foods’Horizon brand and Woodstock Farms’ Aurora Dairy, approves their products bybroadly interpreting a section of the organic guidelines stating that cows musthave “access to pasture” as including feedlot operations. Some milk certifiedorganic by QAI, Cornucopia says, is also fortified with omega-3, apolyunsaturated fatty acid not approved under National Organic Programstandards. In February 2007, the Cornucopia Institute sued the USDA, accusingthe agency for failure to enforce the law.Lax organic requirements are largely a legacy of backroom political deals. AsKastel explains, “The industry-friendly regulators under the Bush administrationhad laws on the books to control these problems, but didn’t have the politicalwill to control them,” he explained. As long as there’s money to be made onorganic products, there will always be the risk that regulators will stretch toclassify almost anything as organic.Legitimately harmful materials are found in many foods labeled organic. Forexample, organic apples at the supermarket may contain streptomycin andoxytetracycline, antibiotics that disqualify meat products from being labeledorganic but are still used on apples and pears due to the regulatory quagmire.And consumers are remarkably ill-informed about what goes into their allegedlyorganic products. A Consumer Reports National Research Center online survey ofabout one thousand people revealed that 85 percent of respondents either didn’tthink (68 percent) or didn’t know (17 percent) that antibiotics are used totreat disease in apple and pear trees. More than half said they did not thinktreated fruit should be labeled as organic. The Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) claims the risk of dangerous amounts of antibiotics in organically labeledfruit is quite small. But do we really want to take any chance, especially whengovernment regulators have proven so often that they don’t have the public’sbest interest at heart? Many groceries and markets now are offering organic orfree-range beef and poultry. But how does one know the purity of this meat? ManyAmericans have tried to turn to healthy foods to fight obesity and its attendanthealth problems. But even then, they are at the mercy of giant foodcorporations, which have exposed them to all sorts of harmful products.For example, PowerBar, the first energy bar used by endurance athletes, wasdeveloped by a Canadian athlete and a nutritionist in 1986, but later sold toNestlé, said to be the world’s leading nutrition, health, and wellness company,which is headquartered in Switzerland.A year after Kraft Foods, a North American unit of Altria Group, Inc. (formerlyPhilip Morris companies), acquired Boca Burger Inc. in 2000, a privately heldmaker of soy-based meat alternatives, its Florida plant was closed.In 2001, laboratory analyses by Greenpeace showed Kellogg’s-owned MorningstarFarms meat-free corn dogs tested positive for StarLink GMO corn and geneticallyaltered soy not approved for human consumption. After Greenpeace urged the Foodand Drug Administration to issue an immediate recall and health investigation ofthe Morningstar product, Kellogg’s voluntarily recalled its meat-free dogs as a“precautionary measure.”Cascadian Farms, an organic food firm begun in 1972 even before the FDA startedcertifying organic food, is now owned by General Mills.Health drinks are not immune to corporate control. Naked Juice of Californiaoperates as a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Odwalla Inc., a leading maker of fruitjuice, smoothies, and food bars, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Coca-Cola.Nestlé, Kraft, Kellogg’s, General Mills, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola collectivelydonated nearly $10 million in addition to the $12 million given by Monsanto andDuPont in 2012 to defeat California’s Proposition 37 ballot initiative proposingmandatory GMO labeling."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-21]DEADLY GRAINS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-21]THE BIBLE STATES THAT EACH PERSON SHOULD HAVE THEIR “DAILY bread,” yet evenbread is no longer the healthy, nutritious food many believe it to be.Many factors contribute to bread products that are increasingly unhealthy andnon-nutritious. One culprit is the intensive agribusiness farming practices thatproduce the wheat used in the bread we eat. Today’s wheat has 28 percent fewerhealth-providing minerals like magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper as compared towheat of previous generations.Furthermore, today’s bread contains many unsafe ingredients. The Ecologist, aUnited Kingdom news site, featured a study showing widespread contamination ofbread by glyphosate, an endocrine disruptor. Glysophate, the basic ingredient ofthe herbicide Roundup, destroys microorganisms in the human gut and hinderscellular detoxification. Studies have also linked it to cancer, Parkinson’sdisease, and Alzheimer’s.For some time, travelers have reported no health problems when eating breads andpasta in Europe yet suffering from a variety of illnesses after eating grainfood back in the USA. Recent scientific papers have stated that the problem liesin the way American farmers harvest wheat.Just before harvest, Roundup and other herbicides containing glyphosate areroutinely applied to wheat and barley both as a drying agent and to increase theamount of seeds in the stressed plant.According to a USDA report issued in December 2014, more than half of food(including processed fruits and vegetable and even baby formula) tested by thegovernment agency showed detectable levels of pesticides, though it was statedmost were within levels the federal government considers to be safe. USDAstatistics, as of 2012, showed 99 percent of durum wheat, 97 percent of springwheat, and 61 percent of winter wheat as part of the harvesting process had beendoused with Roundup, the world’s most widely used herbicide.Probiotics, or beneficial gut bacteria, plays a critical role in human health.Gut bacteria aid digestion, discourage the development of autoimmune diseases,synthesize vitamins, and help build the body’s immunity. Many believe thatRoundup because of its glyphosate significantly disrupts the functioning ofbeneficial bacteria in the gut, leading to illness.In 2013, the EPA approved increased tolerance levels for glyphosate in oilseedcrops and vegetables. A 2014 Reuters news article noted that the USDA does nottest for residues of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, A USDAspokesman who asked not to be quoted said that the test measures required forglyphosate are “extremely expensive . . . to do on a regular basis.” Unusuallyhigh levels of glyphosate have even been found in the breast milk of Americanmothers, at anywhere from 760 to 1,600 times the allowable limits in Europeandrinking water, while urine tests show Americans have ten times the glyphosateaccumulation as Europeans.Dr. Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at MIT who has produced morethan 170 peer-reviewed articles concerning biology and technology, has connectedautism to glyphosate toxicity. She said there is a “remarkably consistentcorrelation” between the use of the herbicide Roundup on soy, corn, and wheatcrops and the rising rates of autism.“At today’s rate, by 2025, one in two children will be autistic,” she warned aconference audience in late 2014. “In my view, the situation is almost beyondrepair. We need to do something drastic.”Dr. Seneff also said additional chemicals in Roundup are untested becausethey’re classified as “inert,” yet according to a 2014 study in BioMed ResearchInternational, these chemicals are capable of amplifying the toxic effects ofRoundup hundreds of times over.The study reported that Roundup herbicide is 125 times more toxic than itsactive ingredient glyphosate alone because of “formulations”—chemical additivesin the herbicide.“Despite its relatively benign reputation, Roundup was among the most toxicherbicides and insecticides tested. Most importantly, eight formulations out ofnine were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principles. Ourresults challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake for pesticidesbecause this norm is calculated from the toxicity of the active principle alone.Chronic tests on pesticides may not reflect relevant environmental exposures ifonly one ingredient of these mixtures is tested alone,” stated the study.Sayer Ji, founder of GreenMedInfo.com, said such studies give a good indicationof how the agrochemical industry “sets up the public for mass poisoning” byconcealing the true toxicity of their chemical formulations and by focusingsolely on the risks associated with the active ingredient in their formulations.Recently, it was reported that thirty-four of forty bread products sampled fromWarburtons, a major British bread manufacturer, contained traces of glyphosate.Critics argue that while glyphosate residue amounts were below the EU maximumallowable, no glyphosate should be tolerated at any level.The use of bromine in bread is also raising alarm. Bromine is used as ananticaking agent or dough conditioner when bread is milled. After fears in the1980s that too much iodine was present in bread, iodine was replaced withbromine in the bread-making process. Prior to this, bromine was used as asedative to treat four different types of psychosis.Bromine has many industrial applications, and is used in flame retardants,pesticides, sanitary products, fumigants, medicines, dyes, and photographicsolutions. Ingesting high quantities of bromine, a central-nervous-systemdepressant, can cause symptoms such as depression, skin problems, andhyperthyroidism. Elevated bromide levels have been implicated in many differentthyroid disorders, from simple hypothyroidism to autoimmune diseases to thyroidcancer.Bromide has also been linked to a variety of neurological problems. Studies haveshown that males ingesting four milligrams of sodium bromide daily havedecreased attention spans and more frequent feelings of fatigue. This numbingeffect could be due to bromide causing oxidation or the loss of electrons in theatoms making up the central nervous system. “In cats, this organic bromineinduced REM sleep. Therefore, bromine has a zombifying potential. Why iodine wasreplaced with a goitrogen possessing carcinogenic and zombifying potentials in apopulation already very iodine deficient, even by the very low RDA Standard,remains a mystery,” wrote Dr. Gary E. Abraham in an article entitled “The Safeand Effective Implementation of Orthoiodosupplementation in Medical Practice”published in the March 2004 issue of the Original Internist. “Nevertheless, itis a very effective way to keep a nation sick and zombified,” he pointed out.Bleached flour is a further concern. Many types of bread, especially enrichedwhite bread, should be avoided, according to Dr. Lawrence Wilson, an Arizonaphysician specializing in nutritional health, because white flour is usuallybleached with highly toxic chlorine bleach, the same bleach used to washclothing. “It is then baked and the concoction creates extremely toxic chemicalsin the bread that irritate the intestines,” said Wilson, adding that in additionto bromide, iron is added. Abnormally high iron levels have been linked to avariety of diseases, from diabetes to arthritis to cancer.But don’t expect the corporate mass media to warn you of such dangers in yourfood. Advertisers wield great clout and the government backs them up. Monsanto’sgrowth hormone IGF-1 has been linked to an increased risk of human colorectaland breast cancer in studies both in the U.S. and Canada. However, the Food andDrug Administration (FDA), American Cancer Society, World Health Organization,and National Institutes of Health all have downplayed the significance of suchstudies.Award-winning journalists Steve Wilson and Jane Akre were both fired when theytried to expose the cover-up of such studies as well as reporting on the ban ongrowth hormones in Europe. According to the Goldman Environmental Prize website,“As investigative reporters for the Fox Television affiliate in Tampa, Florida,[Wilson and Akre] discovered that while the hormone had been banned in Canada,Europe and most other countries, millions of Americans were unknowingly drinkingmilk from rBGH-treated cows. The duo documented how the hormone, which can harmcows, was approved by the government as a veterinary drug without adequatelytesting its effects on children and adults who drink rBGH milk. They alsouncovered studies linking its effects to cancer in humans. Just beforebroadcast, the station cancelled the widely promoted reports after Monsanto, thehormone manufacturer, threatened Fox News with ‘dire consequences’ if thestories aired. Under pressure from Fox lawyers, the husband-and-wife teamrewrote the story more than eighty times. After threats of dismissal and offersof six-figure sums to drop their ethical objections and keep quiet, they werefired.”Although mainstream media outlets appear hesitant to produce stories on harmfulingredients in milk and bread, some grassroots efforts have enjoyed greatersuccess in this matter. One example is the controversy over azodicarbonamide(ADA), used as a dough conditioner by large commercial bakers and found inhundreds of sandwich breads and snacks. ADA is also in yoga mats, flip-flops,and is used as a foaming agent in the plastics industry. The World HealthOrganization has linked ADA with respiratory illnesses and allergies, and the UKHealth and Safety Executive (HSE) recognizes ADA as a cause of asthma. TheUnited States is the only country that allows ADA as a bread ingredient,prompting a petition from one concerned citizen, Vani Hari of the nutritionwebsite Foodbabe.com. Hari’s petition called on Subway to remove ADA from theirbread, pointing out that other industry leaders would likely follow.The petition worked. Subway executives in 2014 announced that the chain hadalready begun removing ADA from its bread recipe. Inspired by this success, theEnvironmental Working Group (EWG), an environmental health research and advocacyorganization, pressed other bread makers to do the same. Already, Wonder Bread,and Martin’s Famous Pastry Shoppes have pledged to do the same.Such efforts demonstrate the effectiveness of individual citizen campaigns,about the only thing that is effective these days. Protests against otherdangerous bread ingredients, such as bromine, will need to be led by similarcoalitions of citizens.Rice is another cereal grain that contains potentially deadly ingredients. In2012, Consumer Reports tested 223 samples of rice products and found high levelsof arsenic in most of them, including many products that contained the verytoxic inorganic arsenic. The study found that arsenic levels of two hundredparts per billion (ppb) or higher were common even in rice-based baby cereals.Arsenic, historically used as a poison, can be found in both organic andinorganic (metal and mineral) forms.Naturally, these disturbing findings put pressure on the FDA, which tried toassuage fears that rice products were contaminated with arsenic. The FDAcommented, “Agency scientists determined that the amount of detectable arsenicis too low in the rice and rice product samples to cause any immediate orshort-term adverse health effects.” In failing to note the long-term healthrisks from chronic exposure to arsenic, the FDA revealed its true agenda—as apolicy arm of food corporations rather than protector of the public.Indeed, the agency has been silent even as compelling evidence about the dangersof arsenic contamination in rice continues to mount. Dartmouth Medical Schoolresearchers found that pregnant women eating rice had higher levels of arsenicin their urine than women who didn’t. Their study found that eating just half acup of rice a day could expose a person to as much arsenic as they would ingestif they had been drinking water that contained the maximum contaminant levelallowed by law—four parts per million for each liter.In addition to arsenic, rice protein products in the natural food industry alsofrequently contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and tungsten.These metals have even been found in some certified organic foods. By mid-2014,concern over the amount of heavy metals in rice protein products promptedpetitions from consumers seeking new limits on these substances.Like Vani Hari’s efforts to limit ADA in bread, the petition drive was anextraordinary success, and resulted in the first voluntary heavy-metals limitever announced in the natural products industry. Despite the fact thatmainstream media coverage of the problem was scant, many major manufacturersresponded quickly and positively to the petition, agreeing to reduce heavymetals by July 2015. The proposed new limits stipulated that lead be reduced to.25 ppm (parts per million), tungsten to .05 ppm, cadmium to 1 ppm, and mercuryto .05 ppm.Mike Adams, while praising the metals-reduction efforts of the manufacturers,nevertheless cautioned, “Lead, cadmium and tungsten are still present in everyrice protein product we’ve tested so far, at concentrations that consistentlyexceed those found in pea protein, hemp protein, whey protein or any otherprotein source we’ve tested. While I expect this situation to steadily improve,there is without question still lead, cadmium and tungsten in rice proteinproducts sold on store shelves right now . . . To my knowledge, none of theseretailers test the products they carry for heavy metals.”It’s difficult for wholesalers and retailers to adequately gauge the safety ofthe rice products they sell since so many of them come from foreign sources.Nearly all the rice protein used in superfoods and supplements sold in NorthAmerica still comes from China and other Asian nations where product testing isvirtually nonexistent. “To my knowledge, no company offering these products hasyet been able to provide its customers an accurate ‘country of origin’ statementfor its rice protein materials,” noted Adams. Without basic information likewhere and how these materials were produced, it’s no wonder that so many riceproducts are marked by contamination.On a few occasions, the rice issue has emerged into the public consciousness. Inearly 2014, the FDA issued a recall notice for all shipments of Uncle Ben’sInfused Rice in both five- and twenty-five-pound bags shipped in 2013. Therecall came after the FDA was alerted to a cluster of illnesses at three publicschools in Katy, Texas. Thirty-four students and four teachers experiencedburning, itching, rashes, headaches, and nausea. Uncle Ben’s Infused RiceMexican Flavor made by Mars Foodservices of Greenville, Mississippi, was thecommon food item all of the afflicted had eaten. The recall echoed a similarcase from December 2013. In that instance, the Illinois Department of PublicHealth notified the CDC of twenty-five children with similar skin reactionsfollowing a school lunch that served an Uncle Ben’s Infused Rice product. NorthDakota also reported a similar incident that occurred in October 2013.As the Uncle Ben’s incidents illustrate, serious contamination scares arerepeated because the FDA has failed to take the necessary action to regulatethese products. Is the FDA involved in a toxic food cover-up? The very idea usedto be called a conspiracy theory. Today, the suspicion is so widespread thateven the mass media cover it, though mainstream outlets have failed to explorethe possibility that lead and cadmium—even more toxic than arsenic—may also bepresent in rice.Could the reluctance of the government, and hence the corporate media, todiscuss cadmium in rice be due to the enormous power of large corporateadvertisers? Or perhaps because we import so much rice from China, America’s topinvestor? These connections should not be taken lightly.There is a crisis of contamination in the grains we consume. Yet due to theentrenched interests of multinational food corporations, sensible regulatorypolicies are unlikely to be enacted anytime soon. As a result, the best way wecan effect change is on the personal level: signing petitions, contactinglawmakers, and choosing to eat only grains that we can actually determine arecontaminant-free. Yet even when we attempt to make the healthiest choices we canas consumers, we are not always successful. Consider the example of consumersattempting to replace their sugar intake with dangerous artificial sweeteners."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-23]DEADLY SWEETENERS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-23]HEALTH-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT for substances that willsweeten their foods without packing on the pounds.

Kaschock-Marenda, the son of an associate professor ofbiology at Drexel University in Philadelphia, decided to test Truvia on fruitflies as a science project after he learned his parents were trying out variousartificial sweeteners in an effort to diet. After purchasing various sweeteners,including Equal, PureVia, and Sweet’N Low, the father-son team fed the flies atDaniel Marenda’s Drexel laboratory. To their consternation, they found thatafter only six days all the flies fed Truvia were dead.Most of the fruit flies in the study lived between 38.6 and 50.6 days, but theflies fed Truvia fruit had an average life-span of less than one week. “The moreyou get them [fruit flies] to consume erythritol, the faster they die,” notedDrexel biology professor Sean O’Donnell, who along with the father and son andothers published a paper on the Truvia study in the journal PLOS ONE.The study found that while the FDA had approved erythritol in 2001 as a foodadditive, “Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that erythritol may beused as a novel, environmentally sustainable and human safe approach for insectpest control.” Yet it’s also being used as a food product.In late 2013, Cargill settled a lawsuit charging that the corporation had misledconsumers by marketing Truvia as “natural” even though it contained “highlyprocessed” ingredients and/or GMOs. While denying liability for falseadvertising, Cargill nevertheless agreed to settle, and announced it would put$5 million toward refunding consumers. It also agreed to change the wording onits product labels, though it would continue to market Truvia as “natural,” eventhough critics said Truvia is actually made from a fermentation process in whichyeast organisms are fed GM corn maltodextrin. Cargill has insisted thaterythritol is not derived from corn or dextrose feedstock but from yeastorganisms. “Yeah, okay, but the yeasts are fed GMOs. So they’re playing mindgames with their explanations,” retorted health advocate Mike Adams. Furtherinquiry into Truvia is needed, and the early results are certainly concerning.But given the vested interests of large corporations such as Cargill, suchrigorous research is unlikely.SPLENDATHE POPULAR SWEETENER SPLENDA CONTAINS THE CHEMICAL SUCRALOSE. Sucralose, whichis made using chlorine, is six hundred times sweeter than sugar. According toShane Ellison, known as the People’s Chemist, chlorine has a split personality.“It can be harmless or it can be life threatening,” he writes. “In combo withsodium, chlorine forms a harmless ‘ionic bond’ to yield table salt. Sucralosemakers often highlight this worthless fact to defend its safety. Apparently,they missed the second day of Chemistry 101—the day they teach ‘covalent’ bonds.When used with carbon, the chlorine atom in sucralose forms a ‘covalent’ bond.The end result is the historically deadly ‘organochlorine’ or simply: aReally-Nasty Form of Chlorine (RNFOC).” Exposure to organochlorines, Ellisonargues, can lead to various forms of cancer as well as diabetes.Sucralose was the subject of a recent study by researchers at the RamazziniInstitute in Bologna, Italy. Institute director Dr. Morando Soffritti and histeam fed 843 laboratory mice varying doses of the sweetener throughout thecourse of their life-spans. Postmortems showed an association between leukemiaand sucralose consumption: the more sucralose the mice consumed, the highertheir risk of leukemia. Further research is needed, but Soffritti urged pregnantwomen and children to avoid artificial sweeteners until more extensive tests canbe done.In the wake of the Italian study, the Center for Science in the Public Interest(CSPI) downgraded Splenda in its Chemical Cuisine guide to food additives from“safe” to “caution” pending further review.Yet the only groups that are conducting further research on Splenda have aspotty record at best: the FDA, Tate & Lyle (the manufacturers of sucralose),and McNeil Nutritionals (the makers of Splenda). Tate & Lyle and McNeilNutritionals, of course, are incentivized to make sure that their product can besold. And recall, it was the FDA that approved Vioxx, which led to more thansixty thousand deaths. And Vioxx was a medicine. Splenda is classified as a foodadditive, which means far less scrutiny from the FDA.Splenda’s manufacturers have defended the drug against the criticisms. MaureenConway, R.D., director of nutritional affairs for McNeil Nutritionals, points toa recent study led by Dr. Tongzhi Wu at Australia’s University of AdelaideSchool of Medicine and funded by the National Health and Medical ResearchCouncil there. Ten men were tested for insulin, sugar, and the hormone GLP-1after drinking four different drinks following an overnight fast. Conway saidthe test showed that consumption of sucralose was no worse than water. She saidthe test “in Australia provides more evidence that Splenda can be used safely byeveryone, including pregnant women, children and people with diabetes.”But detractors point out the limited scope of the study. Yes, Splenda iseffective in avoiding insulin swings, but this does not prove anything about itslong-term health effects in other areas. One potential area of concern is thatthe aspartame and glutamate used in some artificial sweeteners can act asneurotransmitters in the brain by facilitating the transmission of informationfrom neuron to neuron. Excess aspartame and glutamate may be able to graduallydestroy neuronal pathways, causing memory loss, brain lesions, and dementiaoften well before any chronic illness is apparent.Furthermore, these sugar substitutes may be less effective than previouslythought in keeping weight under control. A 2010 study published in the YaleJournal of Biology and Medicine found that noncaloric sugar substitutes,including aspartame and sucralose, do not satisfy the brain in the same way thatreal sugar does, and consumption of sugar substitutes can lead to overeating andobesity. The paper referred to several large-scale experiments that found linksbetween the use of artificial sweeteners and weight gain. The study also notedthat artificial sweeteners can actually encourage sugar cravings and sugardependence.Dr. Louis J. Elsas II, director of medical genetics at Emory University Schoolof Medicine, told the congressional Labor and Human Resources Committee thateven a single use of aspartame has been shown to raise the level of theessential amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. A neurotoxin, phenylalanineexcites neurons in the brain to the point of cellular death, causing emotionaland behavior problems. He said excessive amounts of phenylalanine, whichconstitutes 50 percent aspartame, can damage parts of the brain and isespecially dangerous for infants and fetuses.We’re far from knowing everything there is to know about Splenda, but earlyindications are that it may have unintended consequences and be relativelyineffective as a solution to the problem—an obesity epidemic—it is intended toaddress.ASPARTAMESPLENDA, HOWEVER, COMES OUT LOOKING GREAT IN COMPARISON TO aspartame, describedby Dr. Joseph Mercola as “by far the most dangerous substance added to mostfoods today.” Sucralose, which became popular in part as a result of healthconcerns related to aspartame, has gained market share, but aspartame is stillused in many foods and drinks.Questions abound regarding aspartame, which is now found not only in diet drinksbut also in thousands of food products as well as over-the-counter drugs. Thesweetener’s history is troubling. The Pentagon once listed it as a biochemicalwarfare agent; then the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle discovered thataspartame also produced a sweet taste and pressed for government certification.However, in September 1980, an FDA public board of inquiry concluded aspartameshould not be approved pending further investigations of brain tumors inanimals. It has been reported that later that year, during a sales meeting, thethen CEO of G. D. Searle, future secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, statedthat he planned to use his political pull in Washington to get aspartameapproved.The story is as follows: On the day after President Ronald Reagan’s inaugurationin 1981, Rumsfeld, as a member of the new administration, was instrumental inthe appointment of Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes as FDA commissioner. Hayes, who hadpreviously served in the U.S. Army’s Chemical Weapons Division, initiallyapproved aspartame as a sweetener powder, despite the objections of three of sixFDA scientists responsible for researching it. Drs. Robert Condon, Satya Dubey,and Douglas Park argued against approval, stating on the record that Searlesafety tests were unreliable and not adequate to determine the safety ofaspartame.In 1983, just before he left his FDA position for a public relations job withBurson-Marsteller, the chief public relations firm for both Monsanto and Searle,Hayes approved aspartame for all carbonated beverages.In 1985, Searle was purchased by multinational conglomerate Monsanto, whichestablished the NutraSweet Company. NutraSweet was bought by the European firmJ.W. Childs Associates in 2000.Aspartame’s connection to formaldehyde, a deadly neurotoxin, has raised concernsamong many regulators. A 1998 Life Sciences study concluded that “aspartameconsumption may constitute a hazard because of its contribution to the formationof formaldehyde adducts [two or more compounds combined].” It has beenestablished that aspartame releases free methanol that breaks down into formicacid and formaldehyde in the human body when subjected to temperatures of morethan eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit. Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees. Onequart of an aspartame-added beverage is estimated to contain about fifty-sixmilligrams of methanol.Today, however, the FDA and European Food Safety Authority maintain thataspartame is safe at the levels currently used in food and drinks. Yet aspartameaccounts for more than 75 percent of adverse reactions to food additivesreported to the FDA, according to published reports. These include seizures anddeath. The more than ninety other documented symptoms caused by aspartame listedin a FDA report include headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea,numbness, muscle spasms, weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability,tachycardia, insomnia, vision problems, hearing loss, heart palpitations,breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste,tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss, and joint pain. According to researchers andphysicians studying the adverse effects of aspartame, the following chronicillnesses can be triggered or worsened by ingesting aspartame: brain tumors,multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson’s disease,Alzheimer’s, mental retardation, lymphoma, birth defects, fibromyalgia, anddiabetes. Despite this laundry list of related ailments, the sweetener, which issold under a variety of names including NutraSweet, Equal, E951, Benevia, andCanderel, is ubiquitous. Zachary Shahan, director of CleanTechnica, a popularwebsite devoted to science news and conservation, estimates more than 250million people, or about two-thirds of the U.S. population, consume aspartame inits various forms.Academics who have studied the true effects of aspartame find it a thanklessjob. In 1991, Dr. Janet Starr Hull, an OSHA-certified environmental hazardouswaste emergency response specialist and toxicologist, was diagnosed withincurable Grave’s disease (a defect in the immunization system that leads tohyperthyroidism) only to learn through her own research that she had beenpoisoned by aspartame. She stated: “Many scientists at prestigious Americanuniversities will tell you they cannot get grants for continued research onaspartame or Splenda, or their department heads have been told to drop alldiscussions on the topic. Some will say aspartame research isn’t worth theeffort because they cannot get published in American scientific journals. Othersclaim the research centers constructed by the large corporations, such as DukeUniversity’s Searle Research Center, were designed with managed research as aconstruction proviso.”In addition to ethical questions concerning drug corporations funding academicstudies and research centers, eyebrows have been raised over corporate financingof NutraSweet researchers.For example, former FDA investigator Arthur M. Evangelista noted that SusanSchiffman, named to head a Searle-funded Duke University Medical School studyinto NutraSweet’s link to headaches, is a former General Foods and Searleconsultant. Her research is under the auspices of the office of university vicepresident William Anylan, a former Searle director. Schiffman said she took nosalary for the research and that Anylan played no part in Searle’s pledge tofinance the study, expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Otheracademics mentioned by Evangelista include Dr. David Hunninghake of theUniversity of Minnesota, who was selected to head a Searle-designed study ofaspartame’s effect on the liver by former Searle research director DanielAzarnoff, formerly Hunninghake’s mentor at the University of Kansas.It also has been reported that Dr. Lewis Stegink, a pediatrics professor at theUniversity of Iowa whose studies since the early 1970s invariably indicatedaspartame’s safety, at one point had received more than $1.3 million dollars inresearch grants and gifts (including lab equipment) from the NutraSweet company,according to university records.A longtime research collaborator of Stegnik’s, Dr. Jack Filer serves asexecutive director of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), aWashington, D.C., foundation funding aspartame research, among other things.Filer claims he sees no conflict in his dual roles as ILSI’s executive directorand an aspartame researcher, but declined to disclose his ILSI consulting fees.Filer has argued that health problems blamed on aspartame may simply be “waterload” on the brain caused by the overconsumption of liquids.Such apparent conflicts of interest seem to have prevented inquiry that isdesperately needed. While not focusing specifically on aspartame or otherartificial sweeteners, a 2014 University of Iowa study of diet drinks found thatotherwise healthy women who were regular consumers of diet drinks weresignificantly more likely to die from a heart attack or cardiovascular disease.Nearly sixty thousand women participated in the study, which found those whoconsumed two or more diet drinks a day were 30 percent more likely to have acardiovascular event and 50 percent more likely to die from heart disease thanwomen who never or rarely drank diet drinks.“This is one of the largest studies on this topic, and our findings areconsistent with some previous data, especially those linking diet drinks to themetabolic syndrome,” said Dr. Ankur Vyas, lead investigator of the study, whocautioned that further research is required. “It’s too soon to tell people tochange their behavior based on this study; however, based on these and otherfindings we have a responsibility to do more research to see what is going onand further define the relationship, if one truly exists. This could have majorpublic health implications.”Older readers might recall that for decades the tobacco industry denied anycorrelation between disease and smoking. Doctors and celebrities would recommendthat people smoke to appear sophisticated or to calm their nerves. Could today’sdoctors recommending diet drinks be equally misinformed?In an article published by Inquisitr.com, Terri LaPoint noted that Searle, themanufacturer of aspartame, began developing a drug to combat memory loss shortlyafter the FDA approved aspartame for use in carbonated drinks. “Aspartame is aneurotoxin. Even ants have sense enough to avoid it,” she explained. “Yet dietdrinks add this neurotoxic chemical as its sweetener, and they promote it as aheath food to a public that naively puts its trust in the experts. Then themanufacturers stand ready to offer you drugs to help you with your symptoms thatthey don’t tell you are directly related to your diet sodas. It’s a win-winsituation for them, with the consumer as the loser. You don’t lose weight. Youlose health.”Some physicians have even linked aspartame to rising rates of amyotrophiclateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. A study of U.S.troops deployed in the Persian Gulf during the First Gulf War found that theyhad twice the risk of developing ALS as compared to military personnel who werenot deployed. Dr. Betty Martini points out that these troops were consuming lotsof diet soda, which, in conjunction with other environmental stressors, may beconnected to the disease. “In the Persian Gulf at that time the troops wereconsuming lots of diet pop cooking in the 120-degree Arabian sun for as long aseight weeks at a time, according to vets I personally interviewed in Huntsville,Alabama,” reported Dr. Martini, a member of Mission Possible World HealthInternational.Aspartame has generated such bad press that one large manufacturer has distanceditself from the chemical. The Japanese food and additive corporation AjinomotoKabushiki-kaisha or simply Ajinomoto Co. Inc. was originally a primary maker ofMSG. Today it is the world’s largest producer of aspartame, with a 40 percentglobal market share. In 2009, Ajinomoto began using the name AminoSweet to avoidthe controversy of the name aspartame.OTHER SOFT DRINK HAZARDSAS THOUGH ASPARTAME WERE NOT WORRY ENOUGH, OTHER SODA ingredients have begun tocome under intense scrutiny. A UK study in 2007 revealed a salt derived frombenzoic acid and routinely used as a preservative by the $160 billion soft-drinkindustry changes to cancer-causing benzene when mixed with vitamin C in liquids.Peter Piper, a professor of molecular biology and biotechnology at SheffieldUniversity, found that sodium benzoate damaged the mitochondrial DNA of yeastcells. Mitochondria are tiny free-floating elements within each cell thatconvert the energy from food into a form the cells can use. “These chemicalshave the ability to cause severe damage to DNA in the mitochondria to the pointthat they totally inactivate it: they knock it out altogether . . . there is awhole array of diseases that are now being tied to damage to thisDNA—Parkinson’s and quite a lot of neuro-degenerative diseases, but above allthe whole process of aging,” warned Piper. Although the strength and dosage ofsodium benzoate needed to produce cancers requires further study, many healthauthorities advise avoiding all soft drinks.Other studies have tentatively associated sodium benzoate with attention deficitdisorder (ADD) but these studies focused on food dyes, also accused of creatinghealth hazards, as well.Benzene is a known carcinogen that usually is found in cigarette smoke,automotive exhaust fumes, industrial waste, and around service stations. It issometimes found in contaminated food and water, including some soft drinks.Furthermore, the long-term effects of sodium benzoate poisoning are simply notknown.If the chemicals in drinks don’t get you, the containers might. Whether diet orregular, all soft-drink cans are coated with the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A(BPA), which has been linked to everything from heart disease to obesity toreproductive problems.Recent research indicates that BPA is a potent mimicker of the estrogen hormone,and urinary concentrations of BPA have been linked to obesity, especially inchildren. Dozens of studies have linked BPA with prostate cancer, infertility,asthma, heart disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders.Predictably, in July 2014, the FDA reported that its latest studies indicatedBPA is “safe at the current levels occurring in foods.” However, the EuropeanFood Safety Authority (EFSA) continues to recognize some uncertainty about this“safe” synthetic compound.In early 2015, scientists at the University of Calgary reported concern overbisphenol S (BPS), thought to be a less harmful version of BPA. It is found inmany products carrying “BPA-free” labels. The study, published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found low doses of BPA and BPSto cause underdevelopment and hyperactivity in zebra fish, which share 80percent of their genes with humans.Many plastics also contain dioxins, which have been shown to cause cancer,especially breast cancer. These chemicals from plastics find their way into ourbodies in a number of ways. As Dr. Edward Fujimoto, director of the Center forHealth Promotion at Castle Medical Center in Hawaii, warns, freezing plasticbottles with water in them can release dioxins, as can heating fatty foods inplastic containers in microwave ovens. The combination of fat, high heat, andplastics releases dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cells of thebody. Frozen TV dinners, instant ramen and soups, and such should be removedfrom their container before heating. Fujimoto also notes that the presence ofdioxins is one reason some fast-food chains have moved away from foamcontainers, using paper instead. Fujimoto recommends using glass, such asCorningWare, Pyrex, or ceramic containers, for heating food.Yet the FDA, while not oblivious to the plastics problem, has willfullydisregarded the extent of the risk. The agency admits that the substances usedto make plastics may leach into foods, yet it claims that the levels in foodsare within the margin of safety. The FDA website adds it has “seen no evidencethat plastic containers or films contain dioxins and knows of no reason why theywould,” apparently disregarding clear evidence to the contrary.Though the FDA continues to play dumb on these safety issues, researchers’concerns have begun trickling down to consumers, whose wariness over the healthdangers of soft drinks is beginning to show in soft-drink sales. Industrynewsletter Beverage Digest reported in 2014 that sales fell 3 percent theprevious year, with the number of cases sold reaching a nearly two-decade low.Industry analysts attributed the decline to growing public awareness of thehealth concerns over artificial sweeteners.Yet the industry largely continues to resist improving safety and regulation.Americans concerned about their health must take charge themselves. Eliminatinguse of plastics containing BPA and dioxins is a good first step. Several naturalsweeteners are also likely to be significantly less harmful than theirartificial counterparts. Monkfruit extract (also known as luo han guo or lo hankuo) is two hundred times sweeter than sugar but has a licorice-like aftertaste,and monatin, which is made from a South African shrub, is said to be threethousand times sweeter than sugar. Neither monatin nor monkfruit are known tocontain harmful chemicals, though it must be noted that neither has undergonesignificant scientific tests.Another popular alternative to artificial sweeteners is the easy-to-grow naturalherb stevia, used as a sweetener in Brazil for centuries. Some studies indicatestevia actually is an insulin sensitizer that can aid in reducing blood glucoseand even improve memory. Health authorities, noting the lack of long-termstudies on the regular use of stevia compared to the known dangers of Splenda,suggest users practice moderation in regard to both.Viewing the vast amount of literature and research pointing to potential healthhazards in both the use and overuse of artificial sweeteners, thehealth-conscious reader should consider giving up all carbonated soft drinks.But since this is unlikely in this sweetness-addicted nation, one should atleast make a modest effort to learn which substances should be eliminated andwhich should be limited in consumption.Only one thing is for certain in considering sweeteners: do not allow either thegovernment or the profit-seeking food and drink industry to make decisions foryou."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-25]GMOS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-25]AS IF CHEMICALS, POLLUTION, PESTICIDES, AND POISONS WEREN’T dangerous enough,the past two decades have also seen the emergence of genetically modifiedorganisms (GMOs), today the subject of a growing controversy.GMOs, which now appear in up to 80 percent of processed food, are plants oranimals whose cells have been inserted with a gene from an unrelated species,sometimes even a virus or bacterium, in order to create a specificcharacteristic, often one that resists insects or blight. Although GMO-heavyfoods may have a longer shelf life, bringing in greater profits for themanufacturer, the health costs are deeply troubling. These experimentalcombinations of genes from different species do not occur in nature ortraditional crossbreeding, and no genetically engineered animal has beenapproved for human consumption in the U.S.Early in 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law that mandated thelabeling of food products containing GMOs. The new law was supported by PrimeMinister Medvedev, who stated, “The government will not poison their citizens.”Russia joined more than sixty-four countries worldwide, including fifteennations in the European Union, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and even China, thatnow require labeling of GMO foods. Many have placed restrictions or outrightbans on the production and sale of GMOs. But in the U.S., money talks. Thefederal government has regularly approved GMO products based on studiesconducted by the same corporations that profit from their sale.As the evidence against GMOs continues to pile up, it is becoming obvious thatthe federal government is incapable of providing adequate safety research forthe public. Apparently biotech lobbying is so pervasive that the governmentcannot even impose clear labeling standards.In early 2015, a book by Steven Druker entitled Altered Genes, Twisted Truth—Howthe Venture to Genetically Engineer Our Food Has Subverted Science, CorruptedGovernment, and Systematically Deceived the Public was published to acclaim byscientists knowledgeable on the GMO issue. Druker’s work revealed how for morethan three decades, hundreds of eminent biologists and revered institutions havesystematically contorted the truth about GMO foods and concealed its uniquerisks.In the book’s foreword, the famous award-winning English anthropologist JaneGoodall attacked the idea that genetically engineered foods are no differentfrom natural crops and therefore safe. She noted “how amazingly successful thebiotech lobby has been— and the extent to which the general public andgovernment decision-makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodicaltwisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appearsthat a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminentscientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.”Goodall labeled the push for GMO foods “the biggest scientific fraud of ourage,” and added “the key step in the commercialization of GE foods occurredthrough the unbelievably poor judgment—if not downright corruption—of the USFood and Drug Administration (the FDA) . . . it apparently ignored (and coveredup) the concerns of its own scientists and then violated a federal statute andits own regulations by permitting GE foods to be marketed without any testingwhatsoever.”According to economist Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who served as assistant secretaryof the treasury in the Reagan administration, Dick Cheney used his two terms asvice president to fill environmental agencies, including the FDA, withcorporate-friendly executives.Jeffrey M. Smith, executive director of the Institute for ResponsibleTechnology, proclaimed, “In the critical arena of food safety research, thebiotech industry is without accountability, standards, or peer-review. They’vegot bad science down to a science.”Despite growing public opposition to the use of GMOs, citizens in some stateshave been unable to pass legislation simply requiring the labeling of GMOproducts because the chemical and junk-food industries have spent tens ofmillions of dollars to make sure Americans are kept in the dark. According tothe Environmental Working Group, the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA),Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Monsanto, along with the chemical firm DuPont and othersspent more than $27 million just in the first half of 2014 to lobby against GMOlabeling.In spite of the money spent and narrow defeats at the polls, the movement torequire GMO labeling continued to gain strength and momentum, with fourteenstates considering laws requiring such labels.In May 2014, Vermont became the first state to require GMO labels. The new lawwill take effect in mid-2016 if it survives legal challenges. Maine andConnecticut passed laws before Vermont, but those measures don’t take effectunless neighboring states follow suit.A 2014 California vote on Proposition 37, which would have required GMOlabeling, was narrowly defeated due to an estimated $46 million spent to opposethe measure by food giants including Kellogg’s, General Mills, PepsiCo, andMonsanto. In Oregon, a statewide vote on labeling (Measure 92) came withinfive-hundredths of one percent of winning.Dr. David Bronner, president of Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps and a blogger, stated,“The bottom line is, the GMO labeling movement is on fire and surging. We . . .are as likely to achieve victory through the market by 2016, as we areunleashing and fueling major cultural and market drivers and expect more andmore food companies to flip and accept mandatory labeling just as they did inEurope.”The federal government has also shown that it is able to override localopposition to GMOs. Kaua’i County in Hawaii in late 2013 passed an ordinancerequiring disclosure of some pesticide use as well as GMO crop cultivation, withsome restrictions on crops near schools and nursing homes. But in August 2014,U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Curren overturned the ordinance, saying it waspreempted by other laws and thus invalid. Curren’s action was viewed as avictory by seed and chemical companies in a battle over modern agriculturaltechniques. DuPont, Syngenta AG, Dow Chemical, and BASF were among those whochallenged the ordinance and jointly expressed pleasure with the ruling.Gary Hooser, a Kaua’i council member who cointroduced the ordinance, said thecontroversy is far from over. “One opinion from one federal magistrate does notsettle the issue,” he said.The GMO controversy is a morass, with well-meaning and passionate advocates onboth sides. Bringing suspicion on the pro-GMO proponents is the view that mostof them are in one way or another funded by the very corporations that profitfrom gene modification.Critics offer more emotional arguments pointing to a variety of complaints,whether real or imagined. Anecdotes of GMO harm range from birth defects inDanish pigs fed GMO soy and dying sheep and goats in India to soy allergiesskyrocketing in the UK and the multiple horror stories of lab rats sufferingfrom organ lesions, infertility, altered enzyme levels, and liver and pancreasproblems.Books such as The World According to Monsanto and Seeds of Destruction paint thegiant chemical corporations as mass murderers. They claim that since 1901 thefirms have produced saccharin, PBCs, BPA, BPS, glyphosates, fungicides,pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, Agent Orange, napalm, DDT, neotame,aspartame, chemical and petrochemical fertilizers, heavy metals, and GMOs, allof which have collectively killed more humans globally than all global terrorismcombined over the past two millennia.The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM), an international group ofphysicians and associated professionals dedicated to the study of environmentalillnesses, has reported, “Several animal studies indicate serious health risksassociated with GM food.” These risks include infertility, immune systemproblems, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulation, and changes in majororgans and the gastrointestinal system. The AAEM has asked doctors to advisepatients to avoid GMO foods.One noteworthy complaint against GMOs is that, unlike drug safety evaluation,there have been no human trials of GMO foods. The Institute for ResponsibleTechnology (IRT), which was founded in 2003 and is now active in fortycountries, noted on its website the only published human feeding experimentrevealed that the genetic material inserted into GM soy can transfer into thebacteria living inside our intestines and continue to function. This means thatlong after we stop eating GMO foods with an antibiotic gene, we may still havethis gene inside us, creating antibiotic-resistant superdiseases. If the genethat creates Bt toxin in GM corn were to transfer, it might turn our intestinalbacteria into living pesticide factories.One good illustration of the ongoing controversy over GMOs can be found in thestory of a study conducted by Gilles-Éric Séralini, a professor of molecularbiology at the University of Caen in France, and the founder and president ofthe scientific advisory board of the Committee of Research and IndependentInformation on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN). He is also a member of the EU’sCommission for Biotechnology Reevaluation, created in 2008.In 2012, Séralini and colleagues published a paper entitled “Long-term Toxicityof a Roundup Herbicide and a Roundup-Tolerant Genetically Modified Maize” in thejournal Food and Chemical Toxicology. The research, based on a two-year study ofMonsanto’s genetically modified maize NK603, engineered to be resistant to theherbicide Roundup, reported that mice who were fed the GM corn had an increasein both body and liver weight.“For the first time in the world, we’ve proven that GMOs are neithersufficiently healthy nor proper to be commercialized . . . Each time, for allthree GMOs, the kidneys and liver, which are the main organs that react to achemical food poisoning, had problems,” proclaimed Séralini.This study prompted rapid and vitriolic responses both in Europe and America.Despite support for Séralini ‘s article in an open letter signed by about 130scientists, scholars, and activists published in Independent Science News andfrom proponents of California’s GMO labeling proposition, many mainstreamorganizations viciously attacked the paper.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) accused the study of beinginadequately designed, analyzed, and reported and being “of insufficientscientific quality for safety assessments.”The study was accused of “numerous issues relating to [its] design andmethodology,” including using too small a sample of rats yet it was pointed outthat it was the same as toxicity studies reported by Monsanto, one differencebeing that the Séralini research was conducted for more than two years ratherthan the 90 days of the Monsanto study which affirmed GMO safety. SinceSéralini’s study criteria seems to have matched or exceeded at least one of theMonsanto protocols, his results should be considered at least as valid asMonsanto’s. Critics say Séralini’s findings prove that the Monsanto short-termsafety studies are flawed.Due to the outcry over Séralini’s study, the editors of Food and ChemicalToxicology retracted his paper in 2013 despite Séralini’s objections and despitethe fact that no charges of fraud or misrepresentation were lodged. In June2014, the paper was republished in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe.But accusations that GMO safety has been left up to the same corporations thatprofit from gene modification continue to grow, as does public concern over thelong-term safety of GMOs.Meanwhile, in what some see as a bait-and-switch scheme, some GMO companies arenow using names such as Biologics, Natural Identicals, and Biologics Identicalsto mask the use of GMOs from the public.Furthermore, the Union of Concerned Scientists, following a review of GMOfarming in the U.S., determined that GMOs do not increase crop yields.GMO critics have understandably focused on the harmful effects of GMOs on thehuman body, but we should also look at their environmental effects. GMOs, usedcommonly on crops such as corn, canola, soybeans, and cotton, were initiallyhailed as a means of reducing pesticide use. This claim has since been calledinto question, as overreliance on these crops has led to the emergence of“superweeds,” which are more resistant to herbicides and require increasedspraying.The Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit that aims to achieve a GMO-free food supply,explained, “Over 80 percent of all GMOs grown worldwide are engineered forherbicide tolerance. As a result, use of toxic herbicides like Roundup hasincreased fifteen times since GMOs were introduced. GMO crops are alsoresponsible for the emergence of ‘super weeds’ and ‘super bugs’: which can onlybe killed with ever more toxic poisons like 2,4-D [2,4-Dichlorophenoxyaceticacid, a major ingredient in Agent Orange]. GMOs are a direct extension ofchemical agriculture, and are developed and sold by the world’s biggest chemicalcompanies. The long-term impacts of GMOs are unknown, and once released into theenvironment, these novel organisms cannot be recalled.”In 2014, environmentalists urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notto approve a newly developed herbicide called Enlist Duo, produced by DowAgrosciences. This chemical, which combines glyphosate with 2,4-D in an effortto intensify both, may lead to even more herbicide-resistant weeds, according tocritics. Enlist Duo was developed in response to weeds resistant to glyphosatefound in twenty-seven states.It seems that in addition to the health hazards of glyphosate, this widely usedherbicide has failed to fulfill its promise to rid crops of weeds.Jay Feldman, executive director of the environmental group Beyond Pesticides,noted that the EPA rejected a request by the state of Texas to allow theemergency (meaning nonregistered) use of the herbicide propazine on threemillion acres of cotton due to the failure of glyphosate to kill some weeds aswell as concerns over water contamination. Feldman said approval of Enlist Duowould only be throwing a “life preserver” to growers and perpetuate a “fatallyflawed technology.”Feldman and other GMO critics claim unrestricted use of genetically modifiedherbicides could conceivably create a disaster in the life-essential food chain.“The problem of weed and insect resistance to pesticides was predictable whenherbicide-tolerant and pesticide-incorporated plants were introduced,” saidFeldman. “The promise of genetic engineering for these characteristics hasfailed as a sustainable practice; first, with increasing glyphosate use—and nowthe collapse of the system.”And the footprint of GMOs goes far beyond pesticides and the effects onindividual crops. A recent study even indicated that GMO-engineered plants maybe partly responsible for the release of carbon into the atmosphere, causing anincreasingly warm environment.For some time, carbon emissions have been attributed largely to the humanpopulation, polluting SUVs, and methane from flatulent cows. In 2014, a paperpublished in Yale University’s Yale Environment 360 entitled “Soil as CarbonStorehouse: New Weapon in Climate Fight?” suggested that GMOs and attendanttoxic pesticides and herbicides may also be a major cause of carbon release.According to scientists, more carbon resides in soil than in the atmosphere andall plant life combined. One report stated there are 2,500 billion tons ofcarbon in soil, compared with only 800 billion tons in the atmosphere and 560billion tons in plant and animal life.When soil is damaged as a result of unsustainable agriculture practices, likeplanting millions of acres of GMO soy and corn, and the regular spraying withtoxic pesticides and herbicides, large amounts of carbon are released into theatmosphere. In contrast to healthy soil, which naturally sequesters carbon andpreserves it for the benefit of both humans and the environment, aggressivefarming with the aid of GMOs leads to the release of greater amounts of carbon.Interestingly, one notable way of restoring soil is the planting of cannabis orhemp, which absorbs more CO2 than any other tree, shrub, or plant known to man.But growing cannabis remains illegal in the United States.Rattan Lal, director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management andSequestration Center, reported that the world’s cultivated soils have lostbetween 50 and 70 percent of their original carbon stock, much of which hasoxidized upon exposure to air to become carbon dioxide (CO2). Up until now, thedebate on climate has centered on reducing carbon emissions. “Reducing emissionsis crucial,” Lal remarks, “but soil carbon sequestration needs to be part of thepicture as well.” Lal adds that restoring degraded and eroded lands, as well asavoiding deforestation and the farming of peat lands, should be top priorities.The destructive effects of corporate agriculture may have been felt on a grandscale—climate change—but also in many smaller ways. A troubling mystery wassolved recently when the use of insecticides was linked to the strangedisappearance of honeybees, a phenomenon widely reported in the media. Theworldwide loss of honeybees has caused concern because about three-quarters ofthe world’s food crops require pollination.Writing in the Bulletin of Insectology, researchers reported finding a directlink between the use of neonicotinoids, the most widely used class ofinsecticides, and honeybee colony collapse disorder (CCD). “We demonstrated thatneonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering ‘colonycollapse disorder’ in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival ofwinter,” reported Chensheng Lu of the Harvard School of Public Health and leadresearcher of the study.In a 2014 interview with the Boston Globe, Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at TuftsUniversity, the head of the Council for Responsible Genetics, and author of TheGMO Deception, said that true science demands caution, especially when changingthe genetic makeup of our food. Krimsky explained, “The problem with GMOs goesback to 1992 after the Quayle Commission (named for then-vice president DanQuayle) issued guidelines for biotechnology. That report advised the FDA that‘you didn’t need to test any of these products.’ They simply told industry ifyou see any problems, let us know . . . You cannot predict what’s going tohappen to an organism if you put in a foreign gene. It could interfere withother genes, it could over-express some things and under-express other things.You cannot make predictions without testing them . . . Genes do more than onething. If you think of the genome as an ecosystem rather than a LEGO system, itgives you a different idea of what the possibilities are. We have to test inorder to understand what the foreign gene is going to do to the organism.”Krimsky said creating GMOs is not the same as breeding hybrids, which come fromthe same species. Genetic modification involves putting foreign genes fromseparate species into an organism. He said comparing hybrids to GMOs would be“like saying let’s put a few animal genes into the gamete of human beings andassume that it’s no different than if we just threw in some genes from anotherhuman being.”Citing a peer-reviewed French study that suggested GMOs caused cancer in labrats, Krimsky defended the work by explaining, “When you’re looking at risks fora product or technology, it is rational to look at worst-case scenarios. Ifyou’re testing the safety of a new airplane, you want to test it at the limits,not in safe flying conditions . . . Whenever you’re looking at the risk of aproduct, a single negative result is more important than ninety-nine positiveresults, especially when a substantial number of those positive results arefunded by the agribusiness industry. We’ve had products on the market for fiftyyears: PCBs, asbestos, tobacco, DDT. Early on people said they were safe.”Krimsky, noting his family tries to buy only organic food, said he would feelcomfortable with GMO products only if there were “independent studies asking theright questions and seeking experiments looking for the most vulnerable cases.”Money and politics have prevented such studies from being conducted. Inmid-2014, the UK’s Daily Mail reported on emails documenting collusion betweenthe GMO industry and the British government. The emails revealed a broad anddeliberate strategy designed to thwart European regulations on GMO crops.They asked industry lobbyists for “eye-catching themes” on GMOs to present togovernment officials and even spoke of the creation of a blacklist ofjournalists who wrote stories on potential GMO hazards.Dr. Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch, an environmental group that obtainedthe emails through a Freedom of Information request, says the public would beshocked at the level of collaboration between the pro-GMO Agricultural andBiotechnology Council (ABC) and British ministers that “shifted governmentpolicy to support GM, despite clear opposition among consumers.” The ABC issupported by GMO manufacturers such as Monsanto, Syngenta, and BayerCropScience. “These documents expose government collusion with the GMO industryto agree on PR messages and blacklist critical journalists,” explained Wallace.British journalist Sean Poulter reported that the email exchanges showed that UKenvironment secretary Owen Paterson pushed the EU to allow GMO crops in Britaineven though they were banned elsewhere, while Science Minister David Willettssupported a pro-GM “Agri-tech” strategy to develop new crops with public money.“Such support from two key government figures represents a coup for the GMindustry,” reported Poulter, who noted the email exchanges often coincided withgovernment announcements giving support for GMOs despite consumer opposition.Despite the industry’s efforts to suppress GMO labeling and public awareness,it’s clear that most Americans want these products clearly marked. A 2012Mellman Group poll reported 91 percent of consumers wanted GMO labeling, while a2008 CBS/New York Times poll indicated 53 percent of respondents said they wouldnot buy food that has been genetically modified. A December 2014 AssociatedPress–GfK poll showed 66 percent of Americans support GMO labeling whether ornot they consume such products. According to former FDA adviser Marion Nestle,the battle over GMO labeling boils down to one basic fear by GMO companies.“They didn’t want it labeled because they were terrified that if it werelabeled, nobody would buy it,” she says.As both public awareness and concern over GMOs increases, some companies havebegun moving away from them. General Mills announced in 2014 that its iconiccereal brand Cheerios will no longer contain GMO ingredients, though the companycontinues to fund the fight against the labeling of GMO products. In mid-2014,General Mills purchased Annie’s, the popular maker of organic mac and cheese andother snack products, for $820 million. Some observers suggested the move couldsignal GM shifting its product line into purer foods, but others wonderedwhether the giant corporation was instead planning to add GMO ingredients toAnnie’s products. Herein lies the issue with GMOs: it’s often difficult todiscern which products contain them, and food corporations can profit by beingcoy.In recent years, a few forward-thinking grocery stores and restaurant chainshave made efforts to label GMO foods so that consumers can at least know whichproducts are GMO and which are not. The Chipotle restaurant chain announced itwould be removing GMO ingredients from its menu. Whole Foods Market said it willrequire the labeling of all GMO products at its U.S. and Canadian stores by2018. But such measures as public policy have been voted down after Monsanto andGMO-friendly corporations poured millions into campaigns to prevent suchlabeling.Some question whether GMO labeling would even help. In mid-2014, the HouseAgriculture Committee’s Subcommittee on Horticulture, Research, Biotechnologyand Foreign Agriculture heard from several GMO-friendly academics whoessentially argued that Americans were too ignorant to read and understand GMOlabeling. David Just, a Cornell University professor and codirector of theCornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs, told thesubcommittee, “It is ignorance of the product, and it’s a general skepticism ofanything they eat that is too processed or treated in some way that they don’tquite understand. Even using long scientific-sounding words make it sound likeit’s been grown in a test tube, and people get scared of it.” Another academic,Professor Calestous Juma of Harvard’s Kennedy School, agreed, adding thatmisinformed voters have cowed political leaders, especially in the EU, intoplacing restrictions on the use of GMOs.Not called to testify before the House subcommittee was Jerry Greenfield,cofounder of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, who disputes the argument that GMOlabeling would frighten consumers. “This idea that consumers will be scaredaway—the label will be a very simple thing, a few words on a container sayingsomething like ‘may be produced with genetic engineering.’ It’s not scary,”Greenfield says.Many people, including those in favor of GMO products, view the consumption ofGMO food as an individual choice, a freedom, but one that should involveinformed consent, especially given the controversy the subject has engendered.Everyone should be informed as to which products are GMO and which are not. AndyKimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, sees labeling as theonly way health professionals may be able to trace problems. “For example, ifyou’re a mother and you’re giving your child soy formula and that child has atoxic or allergic reaction, the only way you’ll know if that’s a geneticallyengineered soy formula is if it’s labeled,” he explained.The human body might be able to cope individually with many of these harmfulchemicals and even GMOs. What worries health advocates and nutritionists is thecumulative effect over the long term.Another concern is the corporations and other “middlemen” who take the betterportion of the food dollar. Tracie McMillan, a senior fellow at the SchusterCenter for Investigative Journalism, explained, “When we buy food, we think weare paying the farmer. This is true in a very basic economic sense: some portionof what we spend at the store does trickle back down to the hands that workedthe land. Understandably, we think that if food costs more, it must be becausethe farmer is getting more for it . . . The problem is, that is almost entirelyuntrue.”She estimates that only about sixteen cents of every food dollar goes to thefarmer. The remaining eighty-four cents goes for what is called marketing. Thisrefers not only to commercials and advertising, but the entire chain that makessure food gets from the farm to the dinner table. It includes the trains andtrucks and drivers who move the food from farm to processing plant or warehouse,the mill or the factory where food is processed, and the cost of storing ituntil it is sold. The dollar also pays the wholesalers and retailers, thegrocers, the restaurant cooks who prepare it for us when we eat out, thesatellites and databases used to track shipments, and the workers, forklifts,warehouse, and refrigeration at the grocery store.Still, the bulk of the food dollar goes to one of the ten giant multinationalcorporations that control much of the food supply of the developed world:Nestlé, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Mars, Mondelçz, AssociatedBritish Foods, Danone, and Unilever.These giant food corporations, which have gained dominant control over our foodsupply, are the ones most opposed to food labeling. Most families now eat mealsthat come from supermarket chains or supercenters (stores like Walmart andTarget). Walmart, which sells about one-quarter of all the food purchased in theU.S., is now the largest retailer in history, according to Forbes.Some of the more familiar products made by these firms include the Skinny Cowowned by Nestlé, Tropicana orange juice owned by PepsiCo, Ben & Jerry’s icecream by Unilever, Oreo cookies by Mondelçz International, Dasani water byCoca-Cola, Twinings tea by Associated British Foods, Dannon yogurt by Danone,Old El Paso Mexican foods by General Mills, M&M’s candy by Mars, and Pop-Tartsalong with several cereals owned by Kellogg’s.“Those ten companies . . . are now the biggest food and beverage companies inthe world,” noted Oxfam America, an international organization working toeradicate world poverty. “Together, they generate revenues of more than $1.1billion a day. They also employ millions of people in poor countries, directlyand indirectly, to grow and produce their products. Because of their globalreach and influence, these companies could play a big role in reducing poverty,hunger, and inequality. But right now, they’re not doing enough.” A remarkablechart of the many food companies and brand names owned or controlled by the tenmega-corporations may be found at the Oxfam website listed in the notes section.“With a mere ten companies controlling the world’s food supplies it should givea person pause regarding not only what we are actually eating, but what makes upwhat we put into our bodies,” wrote Rory Hall in the Daily Coin. “When we thinkof food, our minds automatically revert to nutritional items that sustain ourlives and keep us healthy. Some of you may think of vegetables or grains or awell-marinated steak. Whatever pops into your mind, rest assured it probably isnot on [the Oxfam chart]. Well, it may be on the [chart], just not how you maybe thinking of it in terms of nutritional value, wholesomeness, and advancing ormaintaining your overall health.”“If someone can help me to understand that this is not a conspiracy, I wouldreally be appreciative. Otherwise, it sure looks like a controlled plan workingagainst humanity,” concluded Hall.The ten dominant food corporations are owned by globalists or controlled bytheir banks. This presents a scary scenario of a future in which wholepopulations are held under the thumb through the control of food and water.Today a handful of globalist-controlled banks manipulate the world’s financialsystem and they are now working hard to control food and water, both essentialto life. After all, whoever controls the food controls the people.Genetic engineering and such products as Monsanto’s “Terminator” seeds, whichcannot reproduce, could conceivably give that company proprietary control overthe food crops.Glyphosate-based Roundup with its complex of “inert” ingredients, touted as abenign substitute for poisonous dioxin herbicides, is insidious, as it may limitaccess to essential nutrients even as it destroys everything in its path exceptthose plants genetically modified to resist it.Could such chemical herbicides along with GMOs explain why the World HealthOrganization has ranked the U.S. at the bottom of a list of seventeen developednations in overall health? Could the top-down pressure to ruin soil, destroynatural plants, and adversely impact the public health through GMOs be part of aglobal conspiracy of elitists who make no secret of wanting populationreduction?It is not just food that is costing the public both money and health, but alsothe deadly water we drink."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-27]DEADLY WATER [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-27]DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN THE WATER THAT YOU DRINK? DO YOU really want to know?The comedian W. C. Fields once quipped that he never drank water because fishfornicate in it. But toxic water is no joke. According to the National Instituteof Environmental Health Sciences, nearly two billion people worldwide drinkharmful contaminated water. This water is polluted by fertilizers and pesticidesfrom agricultural runoff; sewage and food processing waste; lead, mercury, andother heavy metals; chemical wastes from industrial discharges; and chemicalcontamination from hazardous waste sites.Most Americans take their water for granted, expecting government to ensure itspurity and cleanliness. However, public water supplies may be behind many of thehealth problems facing the nation. Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey(USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have found that anastounding one-third of U.S. water systems contain traces of at least eighteenunregulated and potentially hazardous contaminants, many of which have beenshown to cause endocrine disruption and cancer. Is this the result ofinattention on the part of water authorities or could it be part of a plan tosicken and eliminate portions of the population?A wide range of disturbing materials have been found in American water. In anationwide survey of twenty-five water utilities, scientists found traces of theherbicide metolachlor, a pesticide commonly applied to conventional corn, soy,cotton, safflower, potato, and other crops, as well as the heavy metalstrontium, which is linked to bone problems. Other chemicals identified includeso-called perfluorinated compounds like perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), whichnumerous scientific studies have found can cause thyroid disease and varioustypes of cancer.Of further concern is chromium-6 contamination, which affects the water supplyof up to seventy million people around the country. After investigating waterpollution around Hinkley, California, NewsHour science correspondent MilesO’Brien stated, “In the 1950s and sixties, Pacific Gas & Electric Company admitsit dumped twenty-six tons of a coolant made of chromium-6 into unlined retainingponds here. The poisoning of water in Hinkley was portrayed in the film ErinBrockovich.”The chemical is toxic and causes cancer. PG&E has spent $700 million to clean upthe water supply around Hinkley, but while the chemical’s presence has beenreduced, it still remains in the groundwater. With mounting evidence thatchromium-6 is more dangerous than once thought, the EPA has decided to revisittheir standards for the amount of the chemical that is allowed into the drinkingwater supply. In April 2014, California’s Public Health Department adopted thenation’s first drinking water standard for chromium-6 (hexavalent chromium). Thestandard was set at ten parts per billion, the equivalent of about ten drops ofwater in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. This is five hundred times greater thanthe level set be the state’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Unfortunately, after years of contamination, it may already be too late. Suchhazardous water threatens the health of communities all across the country. InMassachusetts alone, more than a third of the towns have lost all or portions oftheir drinking water to toxic contamination, according to the Toxic ActionCenter (TAC), a New England–based group dedicated to helping communities copewith hazardous pollution resulting from more than a century of irresponsible andillegal handling of toxic chemicals.According to the TAC, the most common public health threat is hazardous wastecontaminating drinking water. “Toxins can seep into buildings built nearhazardous waste sites, causing indoor air problems, respiratory diseases, andchemical sensitivity,” stated the TAC website, adding, “The experience of livingin a contaminated home not only ends normal life, but also can cause seriouspsychological illnesses.”And it’s not only industrial waste that arouses concern. We’ve previously seenhow toxic many prescription medications truly are. And every day, huge amountsof these drugs are flushed away into the water system. Just a partial list ofdrugs found in water supplies is highly alarming. It includes antidepressants,anticonvulsants, tranquilizers, antibacterials, antipsychotics, ACE inhibitors,nitroglycerin, and steroids.According to a 2010 investigation by Time writer Jeffrey Kluger, there are aboutthree thousand prescription pharmaceuticals being used in the U.S. and thousandsmore over-the-counter drugs, “not to mention creams and ointments we smear onand then shower off.” John Spatz, commissioner of Chicago’s department of watermanagement, observed, “Between cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other sources,there are eighty-thousand potential combinations of chemicals.”Kluger noted that while wastewater from homes gets treated at sewage plants,it’s never possible to remove every trace of drugs. “What’s more, sewage pipesbreak, septic tanks overflow, and in some parts of the U.S.‘straight-piping’—which sends untreated sewage flowing directly into surfacewater—is still practiced. One way or another, the drugs find their way back tous,” he wrote.Even everyday items, such as the new “energy-saving” mercury-filled coillightbulbs, may cause health problems. Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) aresaid to be safe, but only if the glass is tube is not broken. Cracked orshattered bulbs can release as many as four to five milligrams of mercury,enough to contaminate six thousand gallons of water.Clearly, clean water needs to become a national priority. The Toxic ActionCenter suggests a federal policy that would identify hazardous waste sites andlevy a pollution tax against any company dumping toxic materials. It alsostresses that states should provide technical assistance, adequate funding, andaggressive deadlines to affected residents in order to ensure the purity oftheir water.Without this sort of action, we are already beginning to see the direconsequences. In August 2014, five hundred thousand citizens of Toledo, Ohio,were left without water due to reports that contaminated algae had been found inLake Erie, the city’s primary water supply. To complicate this situation,officials said the common practice of boiling water for safety only made thetoxic algae more concentrated.The corporate mass media explained the water contamination as the result of“algae blooms” in Lake Erie but mostly failed to mention the true cause, which,according to the Lake Erie Ecosystem Priority (LEEP), a creation of the waterconservation group International Joint Commission (IJC), was phosphorus andother chemicals from both agricultural and urban sources.An obvious solution to such contamination would be to end the use ofagricultural chemicals that end up in the water supply. But this is rarelymentioned by a media dependent on chemical and pharmaceutical advertising. “It’sfrustrating that all attempts to stop the poisoning of our planet arecharacterized as ‘leftist agendas’ by conservative business publications,” wroteMike Adams. “In my view, political affiliations don’t matter if we’re all dyingfrom the collapse of a global ecosystem that we destroyed with our own foolishignorance . . . If I had to pick a philosophical belief system that I reallyfeel strongly about, it would be a system that declares all life to be sacredand seeks to protect living ecosystems from the poisoners who are systematicallydestroying it.”And in many parts of the country, what little clean water remains is fastdisappearing because of unregulated usage. In August 2014, the residents of theSan Joaquin Valley in drought-plagued California found themselves without wateras individual wells dried up. The Tulare County Office of Emergency Servicesresorted to shipping a twelve-gallon-per-person water ration to hundreds ofhomes without water. Bottled drinking water, enough for about three weeks, wasdelivered by firemen, the Red Cross, and volunteer groups at a cost of $30,000and was seen as merely a temporary fix. Some residents told the local media theywere reluctant to admit to being waterless out of fear their landlords wouldevict them or social workers would take their children away. Farmworker OlivaSanchez said she still gets a trickle from her tap, but dirt started coming outwith the water. “I try to use the least possible. I’ll move if I have to,” shesaid.The situation in California is neither localized nor temporary. One state-ownedwell near Sacramento recorded a one-hundred-foot drop in the water table overthree months in 2014, while many other wells simply dried up.It was no joke on April 1, 2015, when California governor Jerry Brown, citingthe ongoing water crisis, ordered mandatory water use reductions for the firsttime in the state’s history. Brown ordered a 25 percent water reduction on thestate’s four hundred local water supply agencies, which prompted some to recallthat during a 1977 drought, a “model” ordinance was proposed that would penalizerepeat water wasters with fines up to $300 or thirty days in jail or both.Richard Howitt, one of the authors of a University of California at Davis studyof the water problem, described the state’s water woes as a “slow-moving trainwreck.” He added, “A well-managed basin is used like a reserve bank account.We’re acting like the super rich who have so much money they don’t need tobalance their checkbook.”WATER FOR THE FEWIT’S CLEAR THAT WATER IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNAVAILABLE TO ordinary people,while the world’s water supply is rapidly coming under the control ofmultinational banks and multibillionaires. “Water is the oil of the twenty-firstcentury,” declared Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow, a chemicalcompany.Megabanks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank,Credit Suisse, Macquarie Bank, Barclays Bank, the Blackstone Group, Allianz, andHSBC Bank are reportedly consolidating control over water resources, eventranscending national boundaries to partner with each other to buy up not onlywater rights and water treatment technologies, but also to privatize publicwater utilities and infrastructure. At the same time, governments are beingpressured to pass laws limiting citizens’ rights to water and self-sufficiency.Oregon resident Gary Harrington was arrested for collecting rainwater and snowon his rural property. Authorities accused him of constructing three “illegalreservoirs” on his 170-acre property. Harrington said although the reservoirsare stocked with largemouth bass, they serve as a contingent against wildfires.“It’s totally committed to fire suppression,” he explained to the media.Initially the state allowed Harrington to collect water but reversed itsdecision in 2003, citing a 1925 law stating the nearby city of Medford hasrights to Big Butte Creek and its tributaries. Harrington argued that his watercame only from rainfall and snowmelt. The disagreement evolved into a protractedcourt battle over property rights and government bullying. “When something iswrong, you just, as an American citizen, you have to put your foot down and say,‘This is wrong; you just can’t take away any more of my rights and from here onin, I’m going to fight it,’” explained Harrington. Nonetheless, he was foundguilty. He surrendered himself in July 2014 to begin serving a thirty-day jailsentence and was also fined $1,500.Other states are following Oregon’s lead with harsh crackdowns on citizens. InJuly 2014, the California State Water Resources Control Board passed “stage one”emergency regulations that empowered all local water agencies to levy a fine of$500 per violation to anyone caught using more than the allocated amount ofwater. In Santa Monica, the city council was considering an ordinance that wouldallot sixty-eight gallons per person for a four-member family, while otherlocations were considering as few as fifty gallons per person. Water usage wouldbe monitored by satellites as well as meters.Ecological engineer Jo-Shing Yang, author of Solving Global Water Crises: NewParadigms in Wastewater and Water Treatment, said the real story in the globalwater issue is one involving “interlocking globalized capital.” “Wall Street andglobal investment firms, banks, and other elite private-equity firms—oftentranscending national boundaries to partner with each other, with banks andhedge funds, with technology corporations and insurance giants, with regionalpublic-sector pension funds, and with sovereign wealth funds—are moving rapidlyinto the water sector to buy up not only water rights and water-treatmenttechnologies, but also to privatize public water utilities and infrastructure.”The corporate world has gained control over water in a number of ways. Oneexample is the 2007 acquisition of UK water utility Southern Water by JPMorganChase. Of note, the oldest living member of the Rockefeller family, DavidRockefeller—who has served as CEO of the Chase Manhattan Corporation and joinedChase Bank in 1946, long before it became JPMorgan Chase—is a member of theelite and secretive Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations, and TheTrilateral Commission. In January 2012, the China Investment Corporation boughta 8.68 percent investment in Thames Water, the largest water utility in England,serving parts of the Greater London area, Thames Valley, and Surrey. In Novemberof that year, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), one of the world’slargest sovereign wealth funds, purchased 9.9 percent of Thames Water.Billionaires also are buying up water supplies. Corporate raider T. BoonePickens reportedly owns much of the Ogallala Aquifer, the midwestern watersource that provides freshwater for the production of roughly one-fifth of thewheat, corn, cattle, and cotton in the United States. Warren Buffett holds ninemillion shares of the Nalco Holding Company, which was named 2012 WaterTechnology Company of the Year. This subsidiary of Ecolab makes water treatmentchemicals and membranes. “But the company Nalco is not just a membranemanufacturer; it also produced the infamous toxic chemical dispersant Corexitwhich was used to disperse crude oil in the aftermath of BP’s oil spill in theGulf of Mexico in 2010. Before being sold to Ecolab, Nalco’s parent company wasBlackstone Group [cofounded by Peter G. Peterson, chairman emeritus of theCouncil on Foreign Relations],” notes Yang.In 2005 and 2006, it was briefly reported in the mainstream media that the Bushfamily had purchased 298,840 acres of land in Paraguay. Not widely reported wasthat the Bush family land sits over the Guarani Aquifer, a freshwater sourcelarger than Texas and California combined. The Guarani is considered the largestsingle body of groundwater in the world.“Unfortunately, the global water and infrastructure-privatization fever isunstoppable,” explained Yang, who noted that many local and state governmentsare suffering from revenue shortfalls and are under financial and budgetaryconstraints. They will find it hard to refuse the offers of private money fromelite banks.“The elite multinational and Wall Street banks and investment banks have beenpreparing and waiting for this golden moment for years,” said Yang. “Over thepast few years, they have amassed war chests of infrastructure funds toprivatize water, municipal services, and utilities all over the world. It willbe extremely difficult to reverse this privatization trend in water.”Such ownership of water supplies gives the wealthy elite and big banks not onlyhuge profits but worrisome control over this vital liquid.And despite the fact that water is in such short supply in so many places, manyfrivolous sources still consume huge amounts of this precious resource. Forexample, there are 125 golf courses in Palm Springs, California, alone. Despiteefforts by the U.S. Golf Association (USGA) to mandate the use of reclaimedwater and grasses that don’t require as much watering, these courses, located ina desert environment, each use an estimated million gallons of water a day tomaintain the fairways and greens. This is about the same amount of water anAmerican family of four uses in four years.With the quality and availability of water raising concern among both scientistsand average citizens, conservation and eliminating the adulteration of our watersupply by wastes must become a national priority.Water issues are a top priority for lawmakers in the states where watershortages are approaching a crisis, but most voters seem oblivious as long aswater still flows from their faucets. At least this was the finding of a poll indrought-stricken Texas. According to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune polltaken in 2013, just 6 percent of respondents said water should be the toppriority, while 50 percent said it should be one of the key priorities and 23percent deemed it merely a secondary priority.“The Legislature has water on the brain, so to speak, but it doesn’t seem thatthe public is following,” said Jim Henson, codirector of the poll. “If you lookat the most important problems facing Texas, water still doesn’t move theneedle.”FLUORIDETHOUGH COMMERCIAL WASTE, CHEMICALS, AND DRUGS IN OUR water supply aresignificant concerns, thus far the adverse reactions to these contaminants havebeen relatively limited in scope. But another, far more ubiquitous concern isimpossible to ignore. Today, more than 70 percent of Americans are drinkingwater containing sodium fluoride, a toxic byproduct of the aluminum industry.Despite the continued protestations of the American Dental Association andvarious U.S. government agencies, science has clearly demonstrated that fluorideis a toxic chemical that can accumulate in the body and brain, causing harm toenzymes and producing serious health problems, including neurological andendocrine dysfunction. Children are particularly at risk for adverse effects ofoverexposure to fluoride.The fluoridation of drinking water began in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1945 atthe instigation of Drs. H. Trendley Dean and Gerald J. Cox, both employees ofAndrew W. Mellon, founder of the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), who asU.S. treasury secretary in 1930 oversaw administration of the Public HealthService (PHS). Mellon had Dean, who worked for the PHS, study the effects ofnaturally fluoridated water on teeth. Dean reported that while fluoride causeddiscoloration of teeth, in some cases it might prevent cavities. Meanwhile, as aresearcher at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, Cox was assigned to study theeffect of fluoride on the teeth of lab rats. He concluded that it seemed to slowdecay, and in 1939, he proposed to fluoridate the entire public water supply.Sodium fluoride is produced by adding fluorine, a highly toxic pale yellowdiatomic chemical. It’s worth considering the other uses for fluorine. It can befound in compounds called organofluorines, carbon-fluorine-bonded chemicalcompounds used to produce such items as Teflon, Gore-Tex, and many drugs such asProzac (fluoxetine), Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Baycol (cerivastatin). Sodiumfluoride also has been used as a rat and bug poison, fungicide, and woodpreservative. Not only is fluoride a product of the aluminum industry, it hasalso been used in the manufacture of atomic bombs. This waste accumulated afterWorld War II in the wake of atomic bomb testing. Critics of fluoride have beencalled conspiracy theorists and shills for junk science, but have gainedcredibility in light of recent peer-reviewed studies.Dr. Donald Miller, a cardiac surgeon and professor of surgery at the Universityof Washington in Seattle, explained how this poison was made palatable to thepublic. “With several instances already on record of fluoride causing damage tocrops, livestock, and people downwind from industrial plants, government andindustry, led by officials running the Manhattan Project, sought to put a new,friendlier face on fluoride. This would dampen public concerns over fluorideemissions and help forestall potentially crippling litigation. Instead of beingseen as the poison it is, people should view fluoride as a nutrient, which givessmiling children shiny teeth, as epitomized in the jingle that calls fluoride‘nature’s way to prevent tooth decay.’“It worked. Early epidemiological studies showed a 50 to 70 percent reduction indental cavities in children who drank fluoridated water. These studies, however,were poorly designed. None were blinded, so dentists examining children forcaries [cavities] would know which kind of water they were drinking. Datagathering methods were shoddy. By today’s evidence-based medicine standardsthese studies do not provide reliable evidence that fluoride does indeed preventcavities,” wrote Dr. Miller. In other words, we’re being forced to ingest asubstance that can damage the brain, lower IQ, and have neurotoxic effects, andwe’re not deriving any benefit from it.Pro-fluoridation scientists, along with dental professionals and public healthofficials, continue to insist that fluoridation of water, toothpaste, andmouthwash is generally safe and can significantly reduce cavities and toothdecay. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), water fluoridationreduces tooth decay by 20 to 40 percent with the only significant negativeconsequence being the risk of dental fluorosis, a discoloration of tooth enamelthat occurs with higher rates of exposure to fluoride. They say this is only acosmetic issue, not a health risk. But those who have investigated fluorideclosely know otherwise.A study by chemists from Russia and Australia published in the Journal ofAnalytical Chemistry in May 2014 indicated that fluoride ions found influoridated water and toothpaste may lead to an increase in urinary stonedisease (USD). Researchers studied twenty urinary stones from Russian hospitalpatients and discovered fluoride ions in 80 percent of them. They concluded thiscould be traceable to high levels of fluoride in the patients’ urine, possibly aresult of drinking water containing fluorides and ingesting fluoride toothpaste.Other studies found on the Internet also link excessive amounts of fluoride tokidney stones (nephrolithiasis).Based on such recent studies, the antifluoride movement has been gainingstrength among informed citizens. In 2014, the Dallas City Council said it wouldconsider removing fluoride from the city’s water supply after hearing argumentsfrom fluoride opponents. Regina Imburgia, the founder of Activists for Truth inDallas, says the council had heard statements regarding fluoride hazards severaltimes in the past but “not one member responded.” She says she was gratifiedthat there now was some movement on “this very serious issue.”As it always does, the mainstream media responded to the antifluoride initiativewith sarcastic disdain. “Anti-Fluoride Cranks at City Hall: Is it Something inthe Water?” chided one newspaper headline, while the Dallas County DentalSociety issued the following statement: “We believe the claims and tactics usedby fluoride opponents are not founded in research but fear.” Such derisionproduced results, for in early 2015 the city council voted to continue thefluoridation of the city’s water.Yet fluoride critics point to a wide body of research supporting their claims,including a 2010 book by Paul Connett, James Beck, and Spedding Micklem entitledThe Case Against Fluoride: How Hazardous Waste Ended Up in Our Drinking Waterand the Bad Science and Powerful Politics That Keep It There. Supported byeighty pages of references, the book underscores the author’s conclusions thatthe fluoride in our drinking water is the hazardous byproduct of the phosphate,fertilizer, and aluminum industries. It is illegal to dump this waste into thesea or local surface water, and yet it is allowed in our drinking water.Nonmedical city workers dump fluoride into the water supply without regard fordosage or quality. Even more damning, the addition of fluoride constitutesmedication without informed consent.“Whatever the reasons that led the U.S. PHS [Public Health Service] to endorsefluoridation in 1950, researchers did not have solid evidence to demonstrateeither the short-term or the long-term safety of this practice,” concluded thebook’s authors. “Not only was safety not demonstrated in anything approaching acomprehensive and scientific study, but also a large number of studiesimplicating fluoride’s impact on both the bones and the thyroid gland wereignored or downplayed.” Connett addressed the Dallas City Council in June 2014to outline the various reasons fluoridation is unethical, including the factthat human beings do not need fluoride, and the fact that Americans have nochoice but to consume fluoride.“The primary strategy that promoters of water fluoridation use is to establishthat authorities say: ‘It’s good; it’s safe and effective’ and that ‘people whooppose fluoridation are stupid, stupid, stupid.’ This strategy is basicallyaimed at keeping you from looking at the actual science,” said Connett, addingthis advice: “The evidence that fluoride causes harm is growing. But before[city] councillors get bogged down in trying to understand which side of theargument has the best or most accurate information, they need to answer thequestion . . . do they have the right to do what a doctor is not permitted todo—i.e., to medicate people without their consent? No, they do not have theright to force medication. To put a medicine in the drinking water defies manyaspects of medicine. You can’t control the dose. You can’t control who gets it.It goes to everybody, including bottle-fed babies.”According to a 2012 meta-analysis conducted jointly by the Harvard School ofPublic Health and China Medical University in Shenyang, studies stronglyindicated that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children.All but one of the twenty-seven studies, involving more than eight thousandChinese school-age children, indicated that high fluoride content in drinkingwater negatively affected cognitive development. Children in high-fluoride areashad significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas.At least forty-nine studies investigating the relationship between fluoride andhuman intelligence conducted by November 2014 along with a total of thirty-twostudies investigating the relationship of fluoride with animal learning andmemory in animals were listed on the FluorideAlert.org website. Out of theforty-nine human studies based on the IQ examinations of more than eleventhousand children, forty-two found reduced IQ associated with elevated fluorideexposure. Thirty of the thirty-two animal studies found fluoride impaired bothmemory and learning. The studies provided evidence that cumulative exposure tofluoride can cause damage to the developing brain of both children and animals.Other, more limited work in the U.S., such as a 2006 National Academy of Sciencereport, also concludes that fluorides have the ability to interfere with thefunctions of the brain and the body by both direct and indirect means.“Fluorides also increase the production of free radicals in the brain throughseveral different biological pathways. These changes have a bearing on thepossibility that fluorides act to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’sdisease,” states the report.The National Academy of Science report includes recommendations that the EPAlower its limit for fluoride in drinking water from 4 milligrams to 0.7. Thereport warns that even at 2 milligrams severe fluorosis can occur, and that alifetime of drinking water with fluoride at the 4-milligram rate could increasethe risk of broken bones. Another study in 2006, this one carried out by theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), suggests that drinking water with more thantwo parts per million of fluoride can cause damage to liver and kidney functionsin children.The effects on the brain may also be dire. “Fluoride seems to fit in with lead,mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain. The effect of eachtoxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can beserious,” says Philippe Grandjean, an author of the NIH study.The studies touting the safety of fluoride rest on shaky ground. After lookingat a number of water fluoridation studies, Britain’s University of York Centrefor Reviews and Dissemination was “unable to discover any reliable good-qualityevidence in the fluoridation literature worldwide.” The review did not showwater fluoridation to be safe. In fact, it found the quality of the research wastoo poor to establish with any confidence the safety of fluoridation.Connett and his coauthors note that the dental industry is not entirelyresponsible for the inadequate information on fluoridation. “The enemy, instead,is a system that is geared to perpetuate a belief in fluoridation by usingprofessional peer pressure, tremendous amounts of promotional money, and thesubtle threat of ostracism. Maintenance of the policy of fluoridation continuesby use of the tools of professional licensure and legal pressure in a long chainof workers who are compelled to continue a practice many of them know is wrong.And, some are compelled to follow state mandates that have been poorlyunderstood, poorly written, yet strongly enforced by professionals who wereresponsible for twisting laws and ethics that should have signaled a poor andfailing medical policy many years ago,” they wrote. “Only the politics offace-saving seems to have formed the basis for the continuation of fluoridation,especially in the U.S. The ignorance by officials of the basic science, law, andethics concerning this issue are unbelievably glaring.”And the problems already described pale in comparison to the potential effectsfluoride may have on the thyroid gland, which is one of the body’s largestendocrine glands and controls how quickly the body uses energy, makes proteins,and processes hormones. A 1958 article in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinologyentitled “Effect of Fluorine on Thyroidal Iodine Metabolism in Hyperthyroidism”noted that “thyroidal, blood and urinary radioiodine studies suggest thatfluorine inhibits the thyroid iodide-concentrating mechanism.” More recentstudies, including a 2006 National Research Council (NRC) report entitled“Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA’s Standards,” concludedthat further research is required on the effects of fluoride on endocrinefunction, especially with respect to a possible role in the development ofseveral diseases or mental states.According to the NRC fluoride report, which was produced by a panel of expertswho reviewed hundreds of published fluoride studies, even small amounts offluoride consumed from tap water not only can disrupt thyroid function but candamage bones, teeth, and brain, and even lower IQ and/or cause cancer.Further studies may offer an explanation for many who suffer fromhyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much of thehormone thyroxin, causing such problems as irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia),heart palpitations, nervousness, anxiety and irritability, tremors, sweating,increased sensitivity to heat, goiters, sleeping difficulties, thinning of theskin, fatigue, and muscle weakness. It also begs the question of the damagefluoride may be capable of inflicting on a normal thyroid.The team of Dr. Richard L. Shames and his registered-nurse wife, Karilee, in2013 changed their attitude regarding fluoridation and the thyroid afternoticing the unexplained skyrocketing of thyroid disease and its spin-offepidemics of fatigue, depression, anxiety, infertility, and obesity.The Shameses discovered a lengthy list of reports in medical journals fromaround the world regarding the harmful effects of fluoride. They also learnedthat prior to the advent of such thyroid treatment drugs as Tapazole, fluoridewas used by the medical profession to slow overactive thyroid conditions. “Everymedicine has a good action, called ‘the benefit,’ and other less desirableactions called ‘side effects.’ In hindsight, it did seem odd that fluoridatedwater was the only substance ever discovered that had a great benefit with noside effects at all. Once we thought about it carefully, it also seemed curiousthat fluoride was the only medicine ever to be added to public drinking waters.”They found, after reviewing hundreds of articles and books, that fluoride couldindeed be considered a “hormone disruptor,” that class of chemicals from manyunrelated sources that have the unintended consequence of altering the properfunction of important hormones in the body, such as that produced by thethyroid.They wondered if perhaps the low concentration of fluoride in water suppliescould help prevent tooth decay without harming the thyroid. They found that thedata indicated otherwise.Although the controversy over water fluoridation most likely will continue foryears, it is now abundantly clear that the benefits of fluoridation have beenoverblown, while the risks have been understated. And the substance isubiquitous: fluoride can be found in a myriad of substances besides toothpasteand water. These include fruit juices, soda pop, tea, and processed foods; evenCalifornia wines, the grapes of which are sprayed with the pesticide cryolite(sodium aluminum fluoride). In other words, fluorine is everywhere, andconsumers must be vigilant in order to avoid consuming it.CHANGING THE GAMEPOTABLE WATER IS A FUNDAMENTAL NECESSITY FOR LIFE AND HEALTH. The public mustbecome more aware of the increasing scarcity of water, the pollution of manywater supplies, as well as the control being sought by large multinationalcorporations such as Coca-Cola, Perrier, and Nestlé along with major financialinstitutions. Frivolous use of water for spacious lawns and golf courses,especially in arid climates, must be reevaluated in light of the growing watershortage.The crisis over clean water and, in fact, the availability of water itself is arecent phenomenon. Years ago, if you asked for water in a grocery store, youwould be pointed to the drinking fountain. Today entire aisles are filled withbottled water, which considered by the gallon costs more than gasoline. Themajority of these bottles are plastic and, along with aluminum can lining,contains the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA), itself the object of muchcontroversy concerning potential health hazards.With the giant corporations that hold sway over government regulators profitingfrom the sale of water and water-related enterprises, it is little wonder thatneither they nor the federal government has given clean water a top priority.Such lethargy on the issue of water is allowed by a population born into asociety that accepts water from the tap as an unquestioned right.The public must be more mindful of water pollution. No longer can the publicafford to continue discarding insoluble materials, to include medical waste,cosmetics, and household cleaners, into sinks and toilets.The practice of introducing fluoride into the nation’s water supplies mustcease, if for no other reason than it is improper to medicate an entirepopulation without their consent. Additionally, recent studies are revealing anumber of problems associated with long-term consumption of fluoride, includingthyroid damage and a susceptibility to cancer.Some have come to view the ubiquitous fluoridation of water, toothpaste, andother consumables as a covert attempt by the globalist elite to both dumb downand reduce the human population.For those who feel a need to use fluoridated products for their children’steeth, as with many health matters, moderation is the key. Use it sparingly andunder close supervision, and do not allow children to swallow productscontaining fluoride."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-29]DEADLY AIR [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-29]IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY, EVEN THE VERY AIR WE BREATHE can be hazardous.In 2012 alone, more than seven million people worldwide died as a result of airpollution. Some of this pollution came from likely sources—ill-regulatedindustries and carbon-spewing vehicles—but it also came from less obvioussources like stoves and cooking fires. Statistics from the World HealthOrganization, along with a World Bank study issued in association with China’sDevelopment Research Center, identify air pollution as the world’s singlebiggest environmental health risk.Both reports observe that the burning of coal, wood, and animal waste for fuelis one of the greatest threats to human health. And it is estimated that withthe increasing urbanization of the human population, especially in China, highlevels of air pollution will continue to grow. Alarmed Chinese officials inearly 2014 declared a “war on pollution” after Beijing continually recorded“very unhealthy” air quality. The pollution got so bad that the British Schoolof Beijing installed a giant inflatable dome, complete with air locks, forsports activities.Americans too are affected by unrestrained air pollution. Research by theNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) published in 2013 notes, “Outsourcingproduction to China does not always relieve consumers in the United States—orfor that matter many countries in the Northern Hemisphere—from the environmentalimpacts of air pollution.”Coauthor Steven J. Davis said study researchers detected a decline of airquality in the western U.S. caused by dangerous spikes in contaminants beingcarried across the Pacific by wind currents. They noted dust, ozone, and carbonaccumulated in valleys and basins in California and other western states. “We’veoutsourced our manufacturing and much of our pollution, but some of it isblowing back across the Pacific to haunt us,” remarked Davis.Any product, no matter where it was created, can cause pollution. Each nationmust assume some responsibility for harmful emissions whether the end product isproduced there or elsewhere.By mid-2014, even officials of the federal government acknowledged the dangerposed by air pollution. In June of that year, EPA administrator Gina McCarthyannounced new rules intended to reduce air pollution by requiring existingcoal-fired power plants to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 30 percent by2030. She said, “Carbon pollution from power plants comes packaged withdangerous pollutants, like particular matter, nitrogen oxide, and sulfurdioxide, and they put our children and our families at even more risk.” Sheadded, “If your kid doesn’t use an inhaler, you should consider yourself a verylucky parent, because one in ten kids in the U.S. suffers from asthma.” McCarthysaid the new EPA rules on primarily coal-fired power plants would be an“investment in better health and in a better future for our kids,” and wouldactually lower electric bills.However, critics claimed reducing carbon-dioxide pollution in the U.S. would notimpact climate-changing pollution from Asia and other developing areas.Despite legislation such as the Clean Air Act, which has helped reduce airpollution, fossil-fuel power plants, boilers, and cement plants still belchpollutants into the sky: the total public cost of pollution in the U.S. wasestimated as recently as 2007 at more than $200 billion yearly. Environmentalorganizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council argue that untilstronger standards to reduce toxic emissions from coal and fossil-fuel-burningindustries are implemented, harmful toxic chemicals will continue to be releasedinto the air of our communities, threatening public health.RADIATIONIF THE POLLUTED AIR ALONG WITH DEADLY FOOD AND WATER DON’T kill us, man-maderadiation just might. As if the destructive power of oil isn’t enough, humanitynow has to contend with atomic weapons and leaking radiation from nuclear powerplants.This issue was brought to the forefront following the devastation of Japan andthe Pacific due to the ongoing leakage of deadly radiation from the 2011tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors. When the reactors weredamaged by the 2011 tsunami, the world was brought to a near-extinction-levelevent and the facility continues to spew dangerous radiation although one hasnot heard much of this recently in the corporate mass media.The Fukushima number one plant, located about 136 miles northeast of Tokyo,suffered three reactor core meltdowns after power to cooling pumps was lostfollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. It was the world’s worstnuclear disaster since the explosion and fire at the Russian Chernobyl plantreleased radiation into the air in 1986.Since the 2011 tsunami, an ongoing series of misrepresentations and blundershave plagued the crippled plant. Much reliance was placed on a state-of-the-artadvanced liquid processing system (ALPS) project, designed to remove the mostdangerous nuclides. However, the ALPS system proved functional only duringperiodic tests.In September 2013, the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power Company(TEPCO) officials admitted that radiation readings around the power plant wereeighteen times higher than they originally reported. In February 2015, Fukushimaplant sensors detected a new leak of highly radioactive water being dumped intothe sea. This water contained radiation contamination levels up to 70 timesgreater than previous leaks. By early 2014, radiation around the Fukushima planthad reached eight times government safety guidelines, according to TEPCO, andthe power company was still struggling to contain radioactive leaks. TEPCOattempted to reduce the radiation level by injecting water into the threecrippled reactors, but this only created highly contaminated water. TEPCO’sresponse has been plagued with problems. More than one hundred tons ofradioactive water spilled from a container during operations in early 2014.Officials said the irradiated water was erroneously thought to be containedwithin a building.Akira Ono, manager of the Fukushima number one nuclear power plant, lateradmitted that repeated efforts to control the radioactive water had failed. Theradioactive water was moved to the wrong building. Ono’s admission came eightmonths after Japanese prime minister Shinzô Abe announced the problem had beenresolved.Previously, the Japanese government had begun diverting some of the four hundredtons of groundwater pouring into the complex each day into the ocean aftergaining the approval of fishermen. Even then, elevated levels of radiation werefound in the groundwater, although TEPCO officials said it was withinpermissible limits.A report presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union’s OceanSciences Section in February 2014 indicated that some Caesium-134 had alreadyarrived in Canada’s Gulf of Alaska area. Radiation carried by both air and seawas expected to reach the west coast of the U.S. by mid-2014, but authoritiessaid it would only be at very low levels. But some were questioning if any risein radiation levels might prove harmful.Some Japanese university researchers have reported their schools will not givethem funds or support for research involving the Fukushima facility. BiologistJoji Otaki with Japan’s Ryukyus University, who has authored papers ondeformities in butterflies caused by Fukushima radiation, advised, “Gettinginvolved in this sort of research is dangerous politically.”Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist with the Japanese government’s MeteorologicalResearch Institute, reported radioactive Caesium-137 in the surface water of thePacific Ocean estimated at levels ten thousand times higher than nuclearcontamination measurements from the Chernobyl nuclear accident.Aoyama submitted an article reporting these alarming radiation levels to thepublication Nature. But when he complied with the request of his institute’sdirector general to remove his own name from the article, the piece wascanceled.Such censorship has not been limited to Japan. Timothy A. Mousseau, a professorof biological sciences at the University of South Carolina, attempted toresearch Fukushima radiation but said he was hampered by the Japanese governmentand three of his associates in the testing dropped out over concerns theirfuture job prospects might be jeopardized.The fear that truthful information on radiation was being kept from the publicwas heightened by the fact that no federal agency was monitoring Pacific Coastseawater for radiation. “I’m not trying to be alarmist. We can make predictions,we can do models. But unless you have results, how will we know it’s safe?”asked Ken Buesseler, a chemical oceanographer at Oregon’s Woods HoleOceanographic Institution.No one is suggesting the 2011 earthquake and tsunami were the result of someconspiracy, but questions remain over the lack of immediate and effectiveresponse, not to mention the ongoing lack of serious coverage in the mainstreamcorporate mass media. Is this just laziness and inattention on the part of thecorporate media or is it indicative of the globalists who want to maintain thestatus quo while culling the population?Adding to radiation concerns is the fact that some insurance companies in 2014began notifying customers that their company would no longer cover any claimsrelating to nuclear energy. Traveler’s is reported to have announced a newnuclear-energy-liability-exclusion endorsement that includes “all forms ofradioactive contamination of property.”The change of insurance policy prompted many to ask if the nuclear disaster atFukushima is as harmless to Americans as the government and some scientists aretelling us, then why are insurance companies specifically excluding coverage fornuclear-energy-related claims?One answer to this question is that in fact there is no safe level of radiationexposure, whether through contact, ingestion, or breathing. Dr. Jeff Patterson,a past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, stated, “There is nosafe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water, or other sources.Period.”Fears are also rising that Fukushima radiation is killing life in the PacificOcean. In 2013, Australian yachtsman Ivan Macfadyen sailed the same course fromMelbourne to Osaka, Japan, as he had ten years previously. His report to theNewcastle Herald was both eerie and frightening.“I’ve done a lot of miles on the ocean in my life and I’m used to seeingturtles, dolphins, sharks and big flurries of feeding birds. But this time, forthree thousand nautical miles there was nothing alive to be seen,” explainedMacfadyen. “In years gone by, I’d gotten used to all the birds and their noises.They’d be following the boat, sometimes resting on the mast before taking offagain. You’d see flocks of them wheeling over the surface of the sea in thedistance, feeding on pilchards.” But on this trip, there were no birds, no fish,hardly any signs of life.Macfadyen says the next leg of his trip from Osaka to San Francisco was evenworse. It was a voyage tinged with nauseating horror and a degree of fear.“After we left Japan, it felt as if the ocean itself was dead,” he recalled. “Wehardly saw any living things. We saw one whale, sort of rolling helplessly onthe surface with what looked like a big tumor on its head. It was prettysickening.”Macfadyen and his brother Glenn, who joined him for the run from Hawaii to theU.S., said not only did they suspect hazards from radiation but they encounteredan unbelievable amount of garbage—“thousands on thousands” of yellow plasticbuoys, huge tangles of synthetic rope, fishing lines and nets, and pieces ofpolystyrene foam by the millions. Also slicks of oil and gas. “The ocean isbroken,” said Macfayden upon returning home.In 2014, Dana Durnford and Terry Daniels, making a 125-mile voyage up theBritish Columbia coast from Vancouver, found tidal pools devoid of life. “Allthe species in the tidal pools are missing . . . We liked to take pictures ofthe varied life but this time we couldn’t find anything to take pictures of,”reported Durnford in a radio interview. “I was also looking for bees but Icouldn’t find but one.”Dr. Timothy A. Mousseau, the aforementioned professor of biological sciences atthe University of South Carolina, in August 2014 supported the observations ofDurnford and Macfadyen by telling the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan,“The [Fukushima radiation] effects on species richness or biodiversity are evenmore striking, dropping off with increasing radiation . . . Very, very strikingpatterns of results . . . I would suggest that what it means is that, contraryto governmental reports, there’s now an abundance of information demonstratingconsequences—in other words, injury—to individuals, populations, species, andecosystem functions, stemming from the low-dose radiation due to Chernobyl andFukushima disasters.”When asked by a reporter if the reported disappearance of animal life might bean effect of radiation on the entire ecosystem, Mousseau replied, “Yes, I thinkthe only conclusion you can come to from the increasing body of evidence ofChernobyl [and Fukushima] is that all components of this ecosystem seem to beaffected, from the bacteria in the soil, the fungi in the soil, all the way upto the top predators . . . they are all connected of course. As we pick away atthe various components of the ecosystem, we have not found any particularcomponents that don’t seem to be affected in some way.”It would appear that the corporate giants put more effort into the constructionand financing of nuclear power plants than in determining suitable locationsthat would provide stable understructure and the least impact on theenvironment.Animal and plant life were not the only things to suffer ill effects in the wakeof the Fukushima disaster. The U.S. aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan was sent toprovide aid to the Japanese. As of 2014, several dozen crew members were stillembroiled in a court dispute over damages for health problems they claim werecaused by exposure to excessive radiation.Still, so far Japan has borne the brunt of the radiation. One Tokyo physician,Dr. Shigera Mita, countered government and TEPCO assurances that Fukushima wasunder control by leaving the city in March 2014, warning that everyone ineastern Japan has become a victim of radiation. He said his clinic has carriedout blood examination and thyroid ultrasound examination on 1,500 patients, manyof them children.In a letter to fellow Japanese doctors, Dr. Mita wrote that his clinic hadwitnessed increased cases of sinusitis. He said many such cases were accompaniedby asthma lasting longer than in the past. He said when children spent at leasttwo weeks in western Japan, they recovered. “With elderly people, it takes moretime for asthma to heal. The medication doesn’t seem to work.” Dr. Mita said hisclinic was seeing more patients with diseases that had been rare before, such aspolymyalgia rheumatic, a disease common among persons over age fifty andformerly contracted by 1.7 people out of every 100,000. “Before [March 2011], wehad one or less patient per year. Now we treat more than ten patients at thesame time,” he said, warning, “Ever since [March 2011], everybody living ineastern Japan including Tokyo is a victim, and everybody is involved . . . Thekey word here is ‘long-term low-level internal irradiation.’”There has been a discernible lack of radiation studies today by the federalgovernment perhaps because leaders are disinclined to remind the public of themore than four thousand secret radiation experiments on U.S. citizens, includingsome two hundred thousand “atomic vets” (soldiers exposed to atomic testing).These tests, made public only in recent years, produced “downwinders,” residentsof Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and West Texas who were exposed toradioactive fallout from the testing of more than two hundred atmospheric andunderground tests. Such tests were conducted under the auspices of the AtomicEnergy Commission, the Defense Department, the Department of Health, Educationand Welfare, the Public Health Service (now the CDC), the National Institutes ofHealth, the Veterans Administration (VA), the CIA, and NASA.In the 1950s and sixties, radiation meters, Geiger counters, and gas masks wereroutinely provided by Civil Defense. Today, they are relics and difficult toacquire.In view of the lack of governmental preparedness and research along withworrisome reports such as those from Dr. Mita, private citizens have beguntaking it upon themselves to monitor for radiation. Christina Consolo, aradiation expert and Canadian radio host known as “Radchick,” claimed importantinformation on radiation was being kept from the public by both federalauthorities and the airlines.Consolo said both she and her daughter in 2013 suffered kidney failure afterabsorbing one-tenth of the FAA-accepted yearly radiation exposure level on aflight from Canada to Cancún, Mexico. She said she had taken a Geiger counterwith her on that trip and that the TSA started impounding Geiger counters soonafterward. Consolo said her research showed a rise in cases of pilots passingout at the controls, sicknesses among both crews and passengers followingflights, and increased instances of unruly passengers.Although the TSA website does not list Geiger counters or radiation detectors asprohibited items, a number of personal experiences by air travelers found on theInternet make it clear that this may be up to the prerogative of the individualTSA agent and one should be most careful and discreet when boarding an airlinerwith such a device.Reports on radiation in California have been mixed. In 2012, scientists atStanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey County reported low levels ofradioactive Caesium in Pacific Bluefin tuna caught off the coast of San Diego.One San Mateo resident posted a YouTube in early 2014 indicating levels ofradiation on a nearby beach at five times the level of normal backgroundradiation. However, state officials were quick to respond. Wendy Hopkins of theCalifornia Department of Public Health told the media, “Recent tests show thatelevated levels of radiation at Half Moon Bay are due to naturally occurringmaterials and not radioactivity associated with the Fukushima incident. There isno public health risk at California beaches due to radioactivity related toevents at Fukushima.” Other health officials joined in, claiming it was safe tovisit beaches.David Hirsch, a nuclear policy expert and lecturer at the University ofCalifornia at Santa Cruz, quipped, “No one should fear a day on the beach. Noone should fear surfing or eating fish.”In mid-May 2014, after analyzing kelp samples from twenty-six locations alongthe Pacific coast, including samples taken in Hawaii and Guam, a forty-memberteam headed by Steven Manley, a professor of marine biology at Cal State LongBeach, and Kai Vetter, a professor of nuclear physics and engineering at UCBerkeley, concluded that no signs of Fukushima radiation had yet been found onthe West Coast. “According to predictions based on our scientific models, weshould see at some point the arrival of small concentrations of Caesium. But theconcentration we are expecting is extremely small and most likely won’t be adanger to the public,” assured Vetter. In other words, the mainstream scientificcommunity is not concerned.Yet some researchers suggest that certain Washington officials may have knownthat the Fukushima disaster was worse than initially reported. Furthermore,these skeptics point out, many nuclear reactors in the U.S. are of similardesign and could be susceptible to similarly catastrophic damage. Five of thesix Fukushima reactors were General Electric (GE) Mark-1s. There aretwenty-three GE Mark-1 BWR reactor nuclear plants in the United States.As far back as 1972, Stephen H. Hanauer, then a safety official with the AtomicEnergy Commission, recommended that the Mark-1 system be discontinued because itpresented unacceptable safety risks. Hanauer specifically cited the smallerdesign of the Mark-1 containment vessel (the steel-and-concrete capsule servingas a final protection against cooling loss) as being susceptible to explosionand rupture, just what happened at Fukushima. Joseph Hendrie, who would laterbecome chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, argued that while a ban onthe Mark-1 systems was an attractive possibility, the technology was so widelyaccepted by the industry and regulatory officials that “reversal of thishallowed policy, particularly at this time, could well be the end of nuclearpower.” Once again, politics and profits trumped safety because nuclear powergeneration accounts for nearly 20 percent of U.S. energy needs; costs for plantsas currently planned could top $1.6 trillion.Chris Carrington, writing for Canada’s Centre for Research on Globalization,asked why General Electric, which with TEPCO jointly operated the Fukushimafacility, was not being held accountable for unsafe U.S. reactors or theFukushima meltdown. “Here’s one possibility,” he noted. “Jeffrey Immelt is thehead of GE. He is also the head of the United States Economic Advisory Board. Hewas invited to join the board personally by President Obama in 2009 and tookover as head in 2011 when [former Federal Reserve chairman] Paul Volcker steppeddown in February 2011, just a month before the earthquake and tsunami thatdevastated Fukushima.“There is no way that Immelt doesn’t know about all the warning his company wasgiven about the design flaws of the Mark 1; and if he knows, the governmentknows,” said Carrington.He said Obama must have known that the radiation from Fukushima is worse than itwould have been had the reactors used at the plant been of a different design,but considered that “GE cannot afford a corporate lawsuit, and neither can theObama administration. It wouldn’t be pretty if a senior adviser to the presidentwas hauled through the courts. There’s a chance it would not just be GE thatwent down in the wake of such a case.”It should also be noted that a year after the Fukushima meltdown, TEPCO wastaken over by the Japanese government, as the company was unable to pay for thedamage and repair of the reactors, with this cost estimated as high as $250billion. Under Japanese law, the companies supporting Fukushima, includingsuppliers like GE, Hitachi, and Toshiba, are exempt from liability. According toa report by Greenpeace International, nuclear suppliers, including GE, Toshiba,and Hitachi, are involved in the decontamination and decommissioning atFukushima and are profiting from it. “Governments have created a system thatprotects the profits of companies while those who suffer from nuclear disastersend up paying the costs,” states the Greenpeace website.The ongoing disaster at Fukushima has had some effect on public opinion,energizing nuclear opponents and even winning over a few formerly pro-nuclearpoliticians. Naoto Kan, Japan’s prime minister during the meltdown, explainedhow he came to oppose nuclear power while still in office.After being forced to consider the evacuation of Tokyo, Kan said, “It’simpossible to totally prevent any kind of accident or disaster happening at thenuclear power plants. And so the one way to prevent this from happening, toprevent the risk of having to evacuate such huge amounts of people . . . fiftymillion people, and for the purpose, for the benefit of the lives of our people,and even the economy of Japan . . . I came to change the position, that the onlyway to do this was to totally get rid of the nuclear power plants.”Kan told radio journalist Amy Goodman his message to President Obama regardingnuclear plants would be: “When considering energy policy from now andconsidering the issues and the problems of cost and also nuclear waste, while itmay have once been said that there was a nuclear renaissance, nuclear technologynow is clearly old and dangerous technology, and we need to be looking at otherways.” Where nuclear power once was hailed as providing energy too cheap tometer, more and more people are realizing that nuclear power is too expensive(both in costs and risks to humans) to continue supporting.Though Fukushima is the most notable recent case, the problem of leakingradiation is by no means restricted to Japan.In March 2006, about nine gallons of highly enriched uranium leaked from a pipeat the privately owned Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS) facility at Erwin, Tennessee.If the leak had continued and puddled, it could have caused a chain reaction andachieved critical mass. Luckily, it was caught and cleaned up before that couldhappen.But it took more than a year for the public to be made aware of the leak, andthis only occurred after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inadvertentlymentioned a uranium leak in its annual report to Congress. The NRC haddesignated correspondence with the NFS as “official use only,” which preventedthe incident from being made public, confirming the fact that in many cases thepublic isn’t even aware of the most dangerous radiation threats.In May 2014, New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) secretary Ryan Flynnrevealed a radiation leak in February at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant nearCarlsbad. It was blamed on the mishandling of nuclear waste. Flynn ordered theLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which controls the nuclear waste dump, tosubmit a plan to secure fifty-seven containers in which nuclear waste was packedwith nitrate salts and organic kitty litter for storage. It was believed thatexchanging organic kitty litter for less absorptive nonorganic litter may havecaused the containment vessel to leak, contaminating twenty-two workers withlow-level radiation.Although officials tried to downplay the danger of the radiation release, Flynnsigned a document warning, “Based on the evidence presented to NMED, the currenthandling, storage, treatment and transportation of the hazardous nitrate saltbearing waste containers at LANL may present an imminent and substantialendangerment to health or the environment.” According to the Associated Press,initial investigations into both the container leakage and a recent fire at theplant placed blame on a slow erosion of the safety culture at thefifteen-year-old, multibillion-dollar site. In the dull daily routine of plantoperation, workers become complacent and sloppy.In July 2014, the South Carolina Electric & Gas nuclear power plant northwest ofColumbia was shut down for weeks after irradiated water was found leaking from apressurizer safety valve. In a notice to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, theutility said the V. C. Summer plant in Fairfield County was closed for repairsafter a small amount of radioactive water was found inside it. A utilityspokesman said the safety valve was part of the plant’s cooling system, keepingthe reactor from overheating and causing a radiation release. The plant is nextto two new reactors under construction in a $10 billion project.And even worse than damage from weather or old equipment is the possibility ofsabotage, such as occurred at the Doel 4 reactor in Belgium in mid-2014 after anoil leak in a turbine caused the plant to be shut down until at least the end ofthe year. With an additional two reactors (Doel 3 and Tihange 2) already closedbecause of cracks in steel reactor casings, Belgium’s nuclear capacity wasreduced by one half. A spokesman for the plant’s owner, GDF Suez, said thedamage to Doel 4 was the result of “an intentional manipulation” in that someonehad tampered with the system for emptying oil from the turbine. Later, Belgianauthorities said the damage may have been an act of terrorism. Very littlemention of this possible sabotage was made in the U.S. corporate mass media.Obviously, the continued use of nuclear power will only prolong the ongoingseries of radiation leaks and potential disasters. But the time and effort, notto mentions the billions of dollars, that giant multinational corporations haveput into nuclear power will make it most difficult for them to relinquish thecommitment to this energy source.MICROWAVE ENERGYIF THE RADIATION LEAKING FROM NUCLEAR WASTE DUMPS AND DAMAGED reactors doesn’tkill you, homegrown radiation from ubiquitous cell phones may do the trick.After all, a cell phone is merely a handheld radio transmitter/receiver bothsending and receiving microwave energy. Anyone with a microwave oven knows whata high-powered blast of energy does to organic tissue. But what about low-levelenergy? The fact is that no one knows, since cell phones have only been aroundfor about twenty years.There’s no question that cell phones have skyrocketed in popularity over thatperiod. According to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association,as of 2010, there were more than 303 million subscribers to cell-phone servicejust in the United States. This was almost triple the 110 million users in 2000.Worldwide, the number of cell-phone subscriptions is estimated to be 5 billion.But new studies have increasingly indicated the deadly effects of prolongedcell-phone use. According to the results of a French study published In theBritish journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, individuals who usedtheir cell phones for more than fifteen hours per month over a five-year periodon average had between two and three times greater risk of developing glioma andmeningioma (brain and spinal tumors) compared with people who rarely used theirphones.This new study only added strength to past studies that had suggested a linkbetween long-term cell-phone use and brain tumors. “Our study is part of thattrend, but the results have to be confirmed,” said Isabelle Baldi, of theUniversity of Bordeaux in southwestern France, who took part in the study.The researchers did agree that due to the ever-increasing use of cell phones,microwave intensity has been decreasing, making it difficult to know just howharmful phone usage might be. However, the French findings correlate with aSwedish study in 2003 that showed increased risk for glioma with cumulativecell-phone use. This research showed an increased risk of tumors in persons whobegan using cell phones before the age of twenty. Apparently, the highest riskof brain cancer from cell-phone use comes is related both to extended use (morethan fifteen hours a week) and to beginning cell-phone use at an early age.Dr. Richard A. Stein, a postdoctoral research associate in the department ofmolecular biology at Princeton University, wrote that the question of cell-phonetoxicity has polarized society as much as the decades-long controversy over theill effects of tobacco. He noted that “cigarette ads continued for decades,featuring health professionals, babies, and even Santa. It took thousands ofscientific studies until establishments that initially adamantly refuted anylinks admitted to the potential health dangers.”Stein observes that several inconclusive studies on the dangers of cell phoneshave been funded by the cell-phone industry. He also notes that while thermal or“heat” issues have been addressed by cell-phone studies, many other factors maybe involved, such as protein leakage through the blood-brain barrier and othercellular damage. He notes some studies also demonstrate “significantcorrelations with infertility, decreased sperm counts, viability and mobility”in men who carry their cell phones below the waist. “The mere fact cell-phonebooklets warn to keep the device at a certain distance from the body is one ofthe strongest indications that the radiation emitted is not totally harmless. Aswith every exposure, some individuals will be less sensitive, other will be moresensitive, but the mere warning shows something is going on,” explains Stein.The phone aside, new studies also indicate that just being near to a cell-phonetower can be hazardous. A 2013 article in the British Medical Journal (BJM)concluded that proximity (anywhere up to 1,600 feet) to cell-phone towersresulted in lack of concentration, vertigo, irritability, difficulty sleeping,and lack of appetite. There are currently more than 190,000 towers in the U.S.,with more being added all the time.Towers communicate with nearby phones through radiofrequency (RF) waves, a formof energy in the electromagnetic spectrum between FM [frequency modulation]radio waves and microwaves. RF waves are different from stronger types ofradiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet (UV) light, which canbreak the chemical bonds in DNA and at high levels can damage body tissues, asin microwave ovens. No one is certain what may result from ongoing low-level FMradiation.Today, the public is exposed to one hundred million times more electromagneticradiation than previous generations. If you can make a cell-phone call, you’rein an area saturated with microwave radiation.Electronic signals from cell-phone towers extend indefinitely but typicallycontinue to decrease in intensity within a radius of twenty-one miles. Almostall Americans, with the exception of a few who live in isolated spots in thewestern half of the country, live within twenty-one miles of a tower, meaning amajority of the population is constantly exposed to cell-tower radiation. Celltowers, which broadcast and receive electromagnetic switching signals, have longbeen suspected of interfering with normal brain and body functioning, as humanbiology relies on electrobiochemical pathways for healthy function. The journalarticle added support to those who claim that electronic pollution, not justindustrial pollution, may be harmful to healthy humans.In the past, those persons claiming that cell-phone energy caused themneurological harm, termed “electromagnetic hypersensitivity,” were dismissed bysome doctors and industry scientists as delusional. However, the BJM studyreported that the phenomenon is real, with eight of ten studies the scientistsevaluated reporting “increased prevalence of adverse neurobehavioral symptoms orcancer in populations living at distances five hundred meters from BSs[cell-tower base stations].”The author of the study noted that the cell towers they examined all met currentsafety guidelines, indicating that these guidelines are inadequate to safeguardthe public from electromagnetic radiation. The study also found that sincecell-tower signal strength is determined by the inverse square of the distance,a person who lives twice as close to a cell tower receives four times theradiation.Close observers of our society have noted how the general public appearsincreasingly confused and irritable. NaturalNews editor Mike Adams wrote, “Asociety that once operated with some degree of sanity and politeness has becomelargely demented and rude. Mathematical abilities are nearly lost across thepopulation, as very few people under the age of forty can even calculate 15percent waiter’s tips at a restaurant. The ability of voters to understand laws,liberties, freedom and even the structure of government is almost entirely lostin nations where cell-phone towers are ubiquitous. Given this recent researchrevealing the negative impact of cell-phone radiation on human brain function,it would be incredibly irresponsible to fail to consider how cell-towerradiation alters healthy brain function and promotes confusion andirritability.”Many thoughtful people in America have begun treating their cell phone liketheir credit card—useful in an emergency but to be used only on occasion.Parents should be especially mindful of the time their children spend on a cellphone.CHEMTRAILSA FEW YEARS BACK, A RETIRED ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WAS visiting a friendstill in the military and stationed at the White Sands Proving Ground in NewMexico, when a high-flying jet flew across the sky leaving a white trail in itswake. During the conversation, the serviceman boasted about the security atWhite Sands, stating that no aircraft were allowed to fly over its restrictedairspace. The former intelligence officer pointed to the craft above them andasked, “What about that airplane?” After looking directly at the jet above them,the serviceman replied with a smirk, “What plane?”This anecdote illustrates the problem of the aerial phenomena that have come tobe known as Chemtrails. Like the serviceman under orders not to admit tooverflights, no one in a position of authority will admit that Chemtrails exist,much less who is responsible for them and what purpose they serve. But unlikemany modern mysteries, this one is visible to anyone who cares to look up on thedays that large high-flying jets weave narrow and continuous vapor/chemicaltrails through the sky. Despite dismissive articles calling Chemtrails merely anew “conspiracy theory” and citizens in denial that something so obvious mightnot be reported in the mainstream media, a growing number of serious researchershave studied the phenomenon.“For more than a decade, first the United States and then Canada’s citizens havebeen subjected to a 24/7/365-day aerosol assault over our heads made of a toxicbrew of poisonous heavy metals, chemicals, and other dangerous ingredients. Noneof this was reported by any mainstream media,” noted the late environmentalactivist and former college professor Dr. Ilya Sandra Perlingieri. “The U.S.Department of Defense [DOD] and military have been systematically blanketing allour skies with what are known as Chemtrails (also known as stratospheric aerosolgeoengineering). These differ vastly from the usual plane contrails thatevaporate rather quickly in the sky.”Chemtrails are nothing new. The U.S. military, in what have been described as“vulnerability tests,” has sprayed chemical and biological compounds in open-airtesting over civilian populations since the 1940s.Just one example was the dumping of thousands of pounds of zinc cadmium sulfideduring nearly three hundred secret experiments between 1952 and 1969. Targets ofthis contamination included Fort Wayne, Indiana; St. Louis; San Francisco;Corpus Christi; Oceanside, California; and even Minnesota’s Chippewa NationalForest.Beginning around 1997, observant people around the world starting noticing thelong trails in the sky that failed to evaporate like the condensation trailsfrom normal aircraft. Condensation trails, or contrails, have been a fixture inthe skies since World War II, when high-altitude bombers would leave a trail ofcondensation behind them.Any aircraft engine, jet or piston, produces warm moist air, which, wheninjected into the cold dry air of the upper atmosphere, results in a trail ofwater vapor or ice crystals that stream out behind the craft. Once theseparticles return to a cooler state, they evaporate back into the air. Thisvaporization can take place within ten seconds or stretch for more than an hourdepending on the temperature and humidity in the atmosphere. Since contrailsprimarily contain water, they present no real hazard to the population.Contrails do not normally occur below about thirty thousand feet.Chemtrails are entirely different. These trails do not evaporate but spread outand eventually form a cloudy haze over the entire sky. As World War II veteranDavid Oglesby noted after observing Chemtrails in the sky above his Californiahome, “The trails formed a grid pattern. Some stretched from horizon to horizon.Some began abruptly, and others ended abruptly. They hung in the air for anextended period of time and gradually widened into wispy clouds resemblingspiderwebs. I counted at least eleven different trails.”The official debunking line that all observed trails in the sky are simplycondensation trails falls apart when Chemtrails are seen simultaneously in thesame portion of sky and at approximately the same altitude. Keen observers havenoticed two planes of similar size laying trails at the same altitude and at thesame time. Yet they are not the same. One is short, while the other reaches tothe horizon. Others ask how it can be that one day there are numerous trailscrisscrossing each other in the sky but on the next day, with no change in theclimate, there are no trails in the sky. Did all aircraft suddenly stop flying?Even more damning, Chemtrails often occur at altitudes and in conditions thatwould make it impossible for a normal contrail to form. Furthermore, contrailsare composed of water vapor, whitish in color, and produce no “halo” effect insunlight. Chemtrails, on the other hand, appear oily and produce rainboweffects, especially in the late afternoon sun. Contrails cannot be stoppedwithout shutting off an aircraft’s engines, but Chemtrails have been observedcoming to an end even as the aircraft producing them flies onward. Aircraft donot shut off their engines midflight.Ohio representative Dennis Kucinich, who served as chairman of a subcommittee ofthe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, once introduced hisunsuccessful Space Preservation Act of 2001 (HR 2977), designed to ban thedeployment of exotic weapons in space. Listed in this legislation were chemical,biological, environmental, climate-changing, or tectonic weapons and, notably,Chemtrails. In 2004, while campaigning as a presidential candidate, Kucinichresponded to a question about Chemtrails by flatly stating, “Chemtrails arereal.”Bob Fitrakis, of Columbus Alive asked Kucinich why he would introduce a billbanning so-called Chemtrails when the U.S. government routinely denies theirexistence and the U.S. Air Force routinely calls Chemtrail sightings hoaxes.Kucinich replied, “The truth is there’s an entire program in the Department ofDefense, ‘Vision for 2020,’ that’s developing these weapons.” In an apparenteffort to conceal classified weapons systems, the more exotic weapons, includingChemtrails, were later stricken from the failed bill.Government, aided by a compliant corporate mass media predisposed to blindlyaccept official pronouncements as gospel, continues to skirt the issue. Noambitious reporter wants to sidetrack their career by digging into the morass ofofficial denials on Chemtrails. Even many politicians appear to be in the dark,having been given the official runaround when it comes to Chemtrails. Afterdescribing condensation vapor trails, and attributing Chemtrail sightings toever-increasing air traffic, air-force colonel Walter M. Washabaugh testified inCongress that Chemtrails are a “hoax.” He stated, “The Air Force’s policy is toobserve and forecast the weather to support military operations. The Air Forceis not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has noplans to do so in the future. In short, there is no such thing as a‘Chemtrail’—the actual contrails are safe and are a natural phenomenon. Theypose no health hazard of any kind.”A Houston, Texas, study found that over the course of sixty-three days ofobservation, military aircraft laid down white plumes that lasted for eighthours or more, while commercial airliners flying at the same altitude leftcontrails that lasted no longer than twenty-five seconds. Stranger still wereobservations of aircraft not filing flight plans and hence not recorded by theFAA or shown in the flight software. “It was discovered that the jets that wereresponsible for leaving highly persistent trails that last for hours did notever appear on Flight Explorer,” the report stated.So how are Chemtrails harming us? In the late 1990s and early 2000s, people—andeven some local TV stations—began to report strange white sticky substancesbeing found on homes, yards, and vehicles. It was lacelike and hung from treesand shrubbery as if it had fallen from the sky. Chemical analysis found thissubstance contained aluminum oxide, barium, polymers, and even traces ofpathogens. People in the vicinity of this substance reported ill effects such asasthma, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, joint pain, and flulike symptoms. TheChemtrail formula was apparently improved, as the number of reports of webbymaterial has declined in recent years.Because no one in a position of authority will admit what is happening right infront of the public’s eyes, researchers have been forced to speculate on whatChemtrails are about.One theory is that the citizenry is being exposed to chemical spraying as acovert means of inoculation, although germ warfare experts and medicalauthorities agree that a high-altitude spraying program is an inefficient methodfor distributing bacteria and viruses. Likewise, there seems to be littleevidence that the Chemtrails are specifically designed to cull the humanpopulation, as was believed by many in the early days of the spraying.Many pathogens have been found in the upper atmosphere, which is an indicationthat illnesses brought on by Chemtrails may not be an intentional part of theprogram. Nevertheless, they may be inadvertently brought to earth by theChemtrail haze. This undoubtedly is a small consolation to those who suffer fromsuch contamination, and indicates an indifference to public harm on the part ofthose responsible for the spraying.One Canadian research foundation concluded that the much-discussed butlittle-publicized Chemtrails may be an attempt to hide a sickening militarysecret. Professor Donald Scott, president of the Common Cause Medical ResearchFoundation, posits that Chemtrails are a belated attempt by U.S. military andintelligence chieftains to stop the spread of a debilitating disease firstconcocted by the U.S. military in the early 1980s.According to Scott’s account, the military began developing diseases in the1970s that were infectious but not contagious. In other words, they developed anailment that could be spread to enemy troops but would not pass into otherpopulations. One such disease was based on brucellosis, a disease that can betransmitted to humans by animals. Brucellosis is a bacterial disease usuallyfound in cattle that can cause undulant fever in humans. By manipulating thedisease, researchers were able to design a disabling bacteria that disappearedfollowing infection. Troops could be infected yet exhibit no signs of thebacteria when examined by a doctor.Scott goes on to say that, encouraged by successful testing and with theapproval of then vice president George H. W. Bush, in 1986, the brucellosis bioagents were shipped to none other than Saddam Hussein in Iraq, who at that timewas fighting a protracted war against Iran at the behest of the CIA. But afterSaddam had obtained a stockpile of Brucella abortus, biotypes 3 and 9, andBrucella melitensis, biotypes 1 and 3, it was discovered that this designerbacteria had mutated and become contagious.According to Scott’s report, Saddam used this pathogen on American troops duringthe Persian Gulf War in 1991, resulting in the illness referred to as Gulf Warsyndrome. More than one hundred thousand Gulf War vets still suffer from thisillness, which causes chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, profuse sweating evenat rest, joint and muscle pain, insomnia, nausea, and damage to major organs.Much of this information may be found in a 1994 report by Senator Donald W.Riegle Jr. entitled, “U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare–related Dual UseExports to Iraq and Their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of thePersian Gulf War.” Some claim a variant of the brucellosis brought home bysoldiers has spread to the civilian population in the U.S., with many people nowsuffering from general debilitation and tiredness.When the contagion began to spread among the general population, top officialswith the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control as wellas the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Resources begana program of misrepresentation of the disease to mask their role in its origin.The illness, initially said to be psychosomatic, later was claimed to beconnected to the Epstein-Barr virus and was labeled “chronic mononucleosis.”This has now become known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Like the veterans beforethem, victims of this ailment were told it was merely a psychological condition.Meanwhile, officials reportedly took steps to counteract the pathogen bycovertly inoculating the public using airborne biological agents withinChemtrails.Media outlets have been complicit in the government’s denial of Chemtrails, andattempts to explore the phenomenon have been woefully inadequate. In February2007, the Discovery Channel aired a program devoted to the issue. Many believedthis was a classic case of misdirection. The program, Best Evidence, wasentitled “Chemical Contrails” and focused on whether jet-aircraft vapor trailsmight be toxic. The first third of the program fairly presented the concerns ofseveral citizens and researchers regarding the aerial trails that appeared muchdifferent from the usual vapor trails. The next third described variousscientific equipment, including a jet engine, which was to be used to testburned particulates from the jet’s exhaust. The final third was an exhaustinglydetailed analysis of the burned fuel that showed no pathogens or any otherharmful chemical or metal in the fuel waste.The show made clear that nothing unusual was to be found in jet vapor trails.But the fatal flaw in its producers’ analysis was obvious. The show’s narratorstated that the U.S. military had refused to allow its jet fuel to be tested,which eliminated the prime suspect for Chemtrails. For their test, the show’sproducers had used commercial jet fuel purchased from a local airport. No wonderthe burned fuel showed no unusual properties. No one has ever accused normal jetfuel of being contaminated with unusual chemicals or pathogens. It also has beenestablished, both by observation and photographs, that Chemtrails emanate fromlines along aircraft wings, not from the engines. This demonstrates thatChemtrails constitute an aerial spraying program, and are not connected to spentjet fuel.One Louisiana TV station in late 2007 took upon itself the task of testing watercaptured under a crosshatch of aerial trails. KSLA-TV News in Shreveport foundexceptionally high levels of barium, an alkaline earth metal rarely found innature, since it quickly oxidizes in air. An excessive amount of barium istoxic, affecting the nervous system and the heart. State health officialsconfirmed to the TV station the danger of barium to the human nervous andimmunization systems but hesitated to link this danger to Chemtrails.Other tests had already identified barium, along with aluminum oxide, among thecontents of Chemtrails. During a three-month period in 2002, three separaterainwater and snow samples from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, were collected andsubmitted for formal double-blind laboratory analysis. Therese Aigner, anaccredited environmental engineer, found significant amounts of barium,aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and titanium in the samples, all of which had averified chain of custody. Aigner concluded that the consistency of the findingsindicated “a very controlled delivery (dispersion) of Chemtrails by aircraft in[the] area.” She added that whoever was responsible for the Chemtrails wasviolating more than a half-dozen laws and regulations, both state and national.The potential environmental effects of Chemtrails are especially alarming, aftera five-year study around Mount Shasta in California determined that Chemtrailswere causing eco-collapse. More than sixty-one thousand parts per billion (ppb)of aluminum were found in snow at Mount Shasta when the normal level should havebeen about 7 ppb. In addition, the soil pH had changed from acidic to neutraland the trees were dying. Most concerning was the fact that about 80 percent ofamphibious species in tributaries had died off and the local potato harvest haddeclined by 80 percent.In light of this fact, it may be more than coincidence that the chemical giantMonsanto has developed genetically modified aluminum-resistant seeds. Could itbe that the environment is being poisoned deliberately in order to enableMonsanto to reap greater profits and gain even more control over the world’sfood supply?Other researchers believe the purpose of Chemtrails may include: environmentalmodification and control, including weather control; biological operations;electromagnetic operations, including the High Frequency Active Auroral ResearchProgram (HAARP) and cell towers; military applications; planetary andgeophysical modification; a global surveillance system; and the detection ofionic disturbances from exotic propulsion systems. At least one researcher,noting that during the First Gulf War barium was fed to the Iraqi insurgents sothey could be tracked by electromagnetic frequency devices, believes Chemtrailsare monitoring individuals and groups.These possible uses aside, there’s clear evidence of the harm of anotherChemtrail ingredient, tiny synthetic filaments called polymers. Polymer chemistDr. R. Michael Castle reports that some of polymers he has studied in connectionwith Chemtrails can cause “serious skin lesions and diseases when absorbed intothe skin.” Such polymers may connect Chemtrails to another controversialissue—the strange and mysterious malady known as Morgellons disease that isreportedly infecting more than twelve thousand American families.In addition to skyrocketing rates of lung cancer, asthma, andpulmonary/respiratory problems blamed at least partially on Chemtrails,Morgellons is an unexplained skin disorder that includes disfiguring sores and acrawling sensation both on the surface of the skin and under it. Strange fibersmatching material from Chemtrails have been found on the sores of peoplesuffering from the disease. But just as government officials deny the reality ofChemtrails, they also discount reports of Morgellons. CDC officials say they’vefound no evidence that Morgellons disease is caused by an infectious agent or asubstance in the environment, and that those experiencing symptoms of Morgellonsdisease may actually be suffering from delusional parasitosis, a mental illnessin which the patient believes they are infested with parasites.Dr. Russell Blaylock says he initially treated reports of health problemsstemming from Chemtrails skeptically, but has now reconsidered. “My majorconcern is that there is evidence that they are spraying tons of nanosizedaluminum compounds. It has been demonstrated in the scientific and medicalliterature that nanosized particles are infinitely more reactive and induceintense inflammation in a number of tissues,” he writes. “Of special concern isthe effect of these nanoparticles on the brain and spinal cord, as a growinglist of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’sdisease, and Lou Gehrig’s disease are strongly related to exposure toenvironmental aluminum.”One other possible ways elites may be using Chemtrails is to modify or controlthe weather. Experiments in this area date back into the 1950s, so it seemsreasonable to assume that some advances have been made. In the 1990s, somescientists, including Dr. Edward Teller, the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” anda founder of the “Star Wars” missile defense system, proposed seeding the upperatmosphere with millions of tons of sulfur or other heavy metals to create acloud cover to deflect sun rays and prevent further heating of the earth. Somescientists warned such a program would turn blue skies milky white and perhapscause droughts and further ozone depletion. Teller admitted the difficulty inpersuading the public to allow a program that would pollute the air with metalparticles, many known to be harmful to humans.And in 1996, the air force published a research paper entitled “Weather as aForce Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025.” The paper concludes that although“offensive weather-modification efforts would certainly be undertaken by U.S.forces with great caution and trepidation, it is clear that we cannot afford toallow an adversary to obtain an exclusive weather-modification capability.” Tothis end, the paper states, “Efforts are already under way to create morecomprehensive weather models primarily to improve forecasts, but researchers arealso trying to influence the results of these models by adding small amounts ofenergy at just the right time and space.” Anyone familiar with past secretgovernment projects, such as the B-1 “Stealth” bomber, knows that if themilitary publicly speaks of a technology, even as a future possibility, it hasalready been developed.Likewise, the globalists often telegraph their plans. A 2013 article in ForeignAffairs, a publication of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), reiterates thebelief in unusual environmental change, stating, “It is clear that, unchecked,climate change won’t just menace natural ecosystems; it will also cause severeharm to humans and could even threaten national security. And, becausegovernments have made barely any progress in controlling the emissions thatcause global warming—the 2000s saw the most rapid growth in emissions of carbondioxide and other warming gases since the 1970s—it’s not so crazy to imaginethat some nation will launch an emergency geoengineering scheme, perhaps beforeits viability and consequences are understood.” Chemtrails could be evidence ofjust such a scheme. The article concludes, “Until the science gets serious, thepolitics won’t reflect what’s really at stake. Meanwhile, the planet keepswarming and the day when geoengineering might be needed draws nearer.”This CFR publication openly discusses a strategy of reducing harmful ultravioletenergy under the name “solar radiation management (SRM).” “The usual proposalsinvolve spraying material into the stratosphere, where it would turn intoreflective clouds, or blowing seawater into the air, with a similar effect. Theclouds could deflect just enough incoming sunlight to offset, crudely, thenumber of degrees human emissions have warmed the planet,” state the authors.“Flying a fleet of high-altitude aircraft that spray particles into the upperatmosphere would cost perhaps ten billion dollars per year—a pittance for acountry that is suffering from severe climate change and seeks a quicksolution.”President Obama’s science adviser John P. Holdren in 2009 discussed“geoengineering” with administration officials and suggested seeding the upperatmosphere with particles of “pollutants” to create a heat shield in the hope ofmitigating climate change. Holdren conceded the possibility of “grave sideeffects,” but said, “We might get desperate enough to want to use it.” Someresearchers believe Holdren may have been testing the waters of public opinionwith regard to aerial spraying as with the Chemtrails.An old journalist credo states, “Follow the money.” If the world continues tosuffer the effects of global climate change, the losses to the agriculture andinsurance industries will be catastrophic. If flooding in the MississippiValley, drought and fires on the West Coast, and unusually strong hurricanes,tornadoes, and storms continue, the United States insurance industry could facebankruptcy, bringing down the entire national economy. Since so many foreigncurrencies are based on the U.S. dollar, this would precipitate a worldwideeconomic crisis. Apparently, someone feels the deaths of Chemtrail-susceptiblepeople, whether the very young or old, is an acceptable cost to prevent thiseventuality.The injection of heavy-metal particles into the atmosphere via Chemtrails maysupport various military activities, such as enhancing radar and communicationsand even boosting the effects of the High Frequency Active Auroral ResearchProgram (HAARP), a vast array of dishes transmitting powerful beams ofelectromagnetic energy into the upper atmosphere located near Gakona, Alaska.Officially, HAARP is designed to study the ionosphere, the uppermost portion ofthe earth’s atmosphere. However, critics of the program claim this powerful toolmay also be used as a weapon to deliver energy blasts equal to an atomic bomb,destroy communications across the planet, and even influence human behavior bybroadcasting human brainwave frequencies. Conspiracy theorists see the HAARPexperiments as the possible cause of recent weather calamities such ashurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes, with some websites regularlytracking HAARP frequencies.As reported in the October 2004 edition of Scientific American, work hascontinued on ways to manipulate weather by using directed energy or seedingclouds with silver iodide from aircraft. Theoretically, directed energy, such asproduced by HAARP, could be used to lessen the strength of a hurricane and, byheating adjoining sea water, actually guide a hurricane away from populatedareas. Of course, if such techniques prove viable, hurricanes may be intensifiedand used as a weapon by guiding them into a specific target, as seen whenHurricane Katrina suddenly veered into New Orleans.In June 2014, the air force announced to Congress that it was closing theAlaskan HAARP facility. David Walker, air-force deputy assistant secretary forscience, technology, and engineering, told the Senate, “We’re moving on to otherways of managing the ionosphere, which the HAARP was really designed to do . . .to inject energy into the ionosphere to be able to actually control it. But thatwork has been completed.” The website geoengineeringwatch.org lists many otherknown and suspected HAARP sites in other Alaska locations as well as inColorado, Massachusetts, California, Texas, Norway, Germany, Wales, Peru,Australia, Japan, and Russia.Another scary purpose behind the Chemtrails was voiced by a retired militaryintelligence officer who became particularly interested in the phenomenon afterbeing doused with chemicals from the air that seriously affected his health.This man participated in the army’s remote viewing program, so he was able topsychically seek the purpose behind the Chemtrail program. What he got wassummed up in one word—“terraforming,” an attempt to alter the environment of theplanet.The case for the reality of Chemtrails is strong, but until there is someofficial recognition of this activity, the tax-paying public will be left to dono more than speculate about its originators and purpose.CHANGING THE GAMEEVERY LIVING THING REQUIRES AIR. CONTINUING TO PUMP POLLUTANTS into the air issuicidal. Every effort must be made on the individual level to maintain cleanair, and such action should include ending any dependence on nuclear power,proven to be a hazardous and unpredictable technology.Cell phones should be kept away from children and their use severely limited foradults. If a phone must be used, a headset should be worn to keep heat andradiation away from the brain.The public must recognize the dangers of the aerial spraying program producingChemtrails and demand a full and honest investigation by both the government andthe news media. The public can no longer simply take the government’s word thatnothing is going on in the skies above them.But once again, public policies on pollution, hazardous technologies, andenvironmental modification will not change as long as corporate and militarypower prevails in governments. A basic restructuring of political power musttake place, first at the local level. Only then can effective efforts be made toensure a safe and clean environment for everyone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-31]A POLICE STATE [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-31]OUR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL OF THESE DEADLY PRODUCTS IS ENFORCED by draconian measuresof surveillance and punishment. Life in the emerging police state of theAmerican republic ranges from the manifestly ridiculous to the deadly.“Whether it’s the working mother arrested for letting her nine-year-old playunsupervised at a playground, the teenager forced to have his genitalsphotographed by police, the underage burglar sentenced to twenty-three years forshooting a retired police dog, or the forty-three-year-old man who died of aheart attack after being put in a chokehold by NYPD officers allegedly over thesale of untaxed cigarettes, the theater of the absurd that passes for life inthe American police state grows more tragic and incomprehensible by the day,”comments John W. Whitehead, founder of the civil liberties watch group theRutherford Institute.Journalist Chris Hedges is an activist Presbyterian minister and best-sellingauthor of several books as well as a finalist for the National Book CriticsCircle Award for nonfiction, senior fellow at New York City’s Nation Institute,and columnist for the websites Truthdig and OpEdNews.He noted that the fall of the Soviet Union left America without a competingsuperpower, which threatened to delegitimize its massive spending on war andstate security, today totaling more than 50 percent of the national budget.Currently it is a group of Islamic radicals who have taken the place of the oldcommunist bloc. The fear and the psychosis of permanent war continue while the“War on Terrorism” has created new and more complicated demands on ourintelligence agencies. “Our illegal and disastrous occupations of Iraq andAfghanistan and our indiscriminate bombing of other countries, along with thewar crimes Israel is carrying out against the Palestinian people, are drivingpeople in the Muslim world into the arms of these militant groups. We are themost hated nation on earth,” wrote Hedges.“At the same time, globalization—our corporate policy of creating a worldwideneo-feudalism of masters and serfs—means we must spy on citizens to preventagitation and revolt. After all, if you are a worker, things are only going toget worse. To quash competitors of American companies, we spy on corporations inBrazil, including Brazil’s biggest oil company, Petrobras, and on corporationsin Germany and France. We also steal information from the leaders of manycountries, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, whose personal cell phonewe tapped. However, Ms. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, should not, as shehas done, accuse us of being the Stasi. We are much more efficient than theStasi was. We spied successfully on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, inaddition to Pope Francis and the conclave that elected him last March. Senior UNofficials and Roman Catholic cardinals are highly susceptible to recruitment byal-Qaida . . . Threats to the nation raised new legal and policy questions,which fortunately our courts, abject tools of the corporate state, solved bymaking lawful everything from torture to wholesale surveillance.”Today, along with being accused of trying to play policeman to the world, U.S.rulers clearly appears to be attempting to turn the United States republic intoan Orwellian police state. And such a state begins with ubiquitous spying on itsown citizens.A SURVEILLANCE STATEEVEN DISREGARDING THE MANY EDUCATED AND THOUGHTFUL people who have come to seethe attacks of September 11, 2001, as an inside job perpetrated by elementswithin the U.S. government, it is now clear that political and military leadersused the horrific attacks as a pretext to raise up both a national securitysurveillance state and corporate defense profits.In post-9/11 America, government intrusion into our lives has grown to the pointwhere the presumption of innocence no longer applies. In July 2014, newrevelations of National Security Agency (NSA) spying showed that the spy agencywas targeting even prominent American citizens with no criminal records.American lawyer, journalist, and author Glenn Greenwald, who worked as acolumnist in U.S. offices of the Guardian, along with journalist and politicalcommentator Murtaza Hussain, whose work has appeared in the New York Times, theGuardian, the Globe and Mail, and Salon, among others, produced governmentdocuments obtained from whistle-blower Edward Snowden showing how the NSA andthe FBI “covertly monitored the emails of prominent Muslim-Americans—including apolitical candidate and several civil rights activists, academics, andlawyers—under secretive procedures intended to target terrorists and foreignspies.”Faisal Gill, one of those targeted by government surveillance, said he is alongtime Republican Party operative who once served in the Department ofHomeland Security under President George W. Bush and held a top-secret securityclearance.“I went to school here as a fourth grader—learned about the Revolutionary War,learned about individual rights, Thomas Jefferson, all these things,” said Gill.“That is ingrained in you—your privacy is important. And to have that basicallyinvaded for no reason whatsoever—for the fact that I didn’t do anything—I thinkthat’s troubling. And I think that certainly goes to show how we need to shapepolicy differently than it is right now.”Mass surveillance by the U.S. can be traced back to the Spanish-American Warwhen U.S. forces in the Philippines maintained card files on 70 percent of thepopulation. This system was brought back to the U.S. and incorporated intolegislation such as the 1917 Espionage Act and the 1918 Sedition Act.During World War II, the FBI set up surveillance systems in foreign countriessuch as Brazil and Colombia. After the war, the espionage territory was expandedto Japan, Greece, Uruguay, and other countries feared susceptible to communistinfiltration. In Guatemala in 1954, the CIA used various methods of surveillancein its effective overthrow of the government of Jacobo Árbenz. American advisersthen helped create a vast filing system there to hunt down enemies of the newU.S.-backed regime. This program, known as the National Police Archive, trackedthe movements of dissidents, recorded their political opinions, identified theirassociates, mapped their daily routes, and, ultimately, eliminated them.Today, the cutting edge of the surveillance state is the NSA. Prior to the 2013Snowden leaks, few people were aware of the NSA’s existence, even as it rapidlygrew around them. Those who were aware of the NSA’s existence but were underrestrictions not to talk about it laughingly referred to it as “No Such Agency.”Snowden, a former NSA contractor, was given sanctuary in Russia after U.S.authorities sought his arrest for exposing mass global surveillance programs ledby the NSA and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), its Britishcounterpart. The leaks revealed these organizations’ disturbing practices, whichincluded tapping Internet networks, emails, and phone calls of millions ofordinary citizens, as well as the political leaders of other nations.Though branded a traitor by hard-line war supporters and intelligence chiefs athome, Snowden provided a thought-provoking explanation for his actions in 2012with a statement not widely reported in the corporate mass media: “A little overone month ago, I had family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort. Ialso had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read yourcommunications. Anyone’s communications at any time. That is the power to changepeople’s fates.“It is also a serious violation of the law. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments tothe Constitution of my country, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights, and numerous statutes and treaties forbid such systems of massive,pervasive surveillance. While the U.S. Constitution marks these programs asillegal, my government argues that secret court rulings, which the world is notpermitted to see, somehow legitimize an illegal affair. These rulings simplycorrupt the most basic notion of justice—that it must be seen to be done. Theimmoral cannot be made moral through the use of secret law.“I believe in the principle declared at Nuremberg in 1945: Individuals haveinternational duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience.Therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to preventcrimes against peace and humanity from occurring.“Accordingly, I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct thiswrongdoing. I did not seek to enrich myself. I did not seek to sell U.S.secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety.Instead, I took what I knew to the public, so what affects all of us can bediscussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice.“That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us hasbeen costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets.”Snowden’s actions reflect the fact that today the U.S. surveillance state hasexpanded to an unimaginable extent.Christopher Ketchum, writing in Radar magazine, quoted a senior governmentofficial who carried high-level security clearances through five administrationsand who revealed that “there exists a database of Americans who, often for theslightest and most trivial reason, are considered unfriendly, and who, in a timeof panic, might be incarcerated. The database can identify and locate perceived‘enemies of the state’ almost instantaneously.”Ketchum reports that the database is sometimes referred to by the code name“Main Core” and that some eight million Americans were listed in Main Core aspotentially suspect in 2008. It is suspected that many more have been addedsince then. “In the event of a national emergency, these people could be subjectto everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioningand possibly even detention,” writes Ketchum.Reportedly, the Main Core database, begun in the early 1980s, collects andstores—without warrants or court orders—the names of and detailed data aboutAmericans considered to be threats to national security. Tim Shorrock, in Salonmagazine, wrote, “According to several former U.S. government officials withextensive knowledge of intelligence operations, Main Core in its currentincarnation apparently contains a vast amount of personal data on Americans,including NSA intercepts of bank and credit card transactions and the results ofsurveillance efforts by the FBI, the CIA and other agencies.“One former intelligence official described Main Core as ‘an emergency internalsecurity database system’ designed for use by the military in the event of anational catastrophe, a suspension of the Constitution or the imposition ofmartial law. Its name, he says, is derived from the fact that it contains‘copies of the “main core” or essence of each item of intelligence informationon Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligencecommunity.’”Assistant professor of history at Harvard University Kirsten Weld noted, “TheNational Security Agency’s surveillance leviathan, funded by a black budget andpresided over by a star-chamber court, suctions up almost inconceivable amountsof material from around the world, including your phone and computer.”Weld wrote, “As one former U.S. intelligence official explained, ‘rather thanlook for a single needle in the haystack’—scanning for information on particularcases of interest—the new strategy is now to ‘collect the whole haystack.’ Thisbegan in earnest with the Real Time Regional Gateway program [RTRG], implementedin Iraq and then in Afghanistan to vacuum up all possible information. The ethosof RTRG appeared in the U.S. in the form of the PRISM data-mining program.Americans were scandalized to learn from . . . Edward Snowden that the wholehaystack included their phone calls and emails. They should understand that thiswill remain the case for as long as the U.S. is permitted to maintain itsamorphous campaign against ‘terror,’ the diffuse goals of which are now seen torequire a blanket approach to information gathering.”A centralized governmental database carrying files on all citizens, regardlessof any criminal or mental health record, makes a mockery out of any concept ofindividual freedom.One of the most egregious examples of such spying came in mid-2014 when Snowden,in an interview, revealed that in “numerous instances” he saw NSA employeespassing around nude photographs intercepted “in the course of their daily work.”“You’ve got young enlisted guys, eighteen to twenty-two years old,” Snowdenexplained. “They’ve suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinaryresponsibility where they now have access to all of your private records. In thecourse of their daily work they stumble across something that is completelyunrelated to their work in any sort of necessary sense. For example, an intimatenude photo of someone in a sexually compromising position. But they’re extremelyattractive.“So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and show their co-worker.The co-worker says, ‘Hey that’s great. Send that to Bill down the way.’ And thenBill sends it to George and George sends it to Tom. And sooner or later thisperson’s whole life has been seen by all of these other people. It’s neverreported. Nobody ever knows about it because the auditing of these systems isincredibly weak. The fact that your private images, records of your privatelives, records of your intimate moments have been taken from your privatecommunications stream from the intended recipient and given to the governmentwithout any specific authorization without any specific need is itself aviolation of your rights. Why is that in a government database?”A spokesperson for the NSA, while not specifically denying Snowden’s allegation,did say the agency has zero tolerance for such violations of the agency’sstandards. However, a September 2013 letter from the NSA’s inspector general Dr.George Ellard to Iowa senator Chuck Grassley mentioned instances in which NSAagents admitted spying on former love interests.In early March 2015, the House approved the Department of Homeland Security’srequest for a yearly budget of almost $40 billion. However, the truth of thematter is that the system of national security is so vast and so secret that noone in the public has any idea of the size of some programs or how much theytruly spend.New technologies and the expansion of America’s two dozen alphabet intelligenceagencies has created a global corporate system of surveillance infringing on therights of people both at home and abroad. The sometimes violent reaction offoreign populations to U.S. spying and military adventures only ensures endlessconflicts and wars. But this also ensures endless profits for the war industriesowned by globalists, which may be the real objective.Such massive surveillance concerns many citizens on both ends of the politicalspectrum. What has been touted by government officials as a means to protect ushas slowly been transformed into a surveillance state being used to protect thegovernment and the people who control it from any public rebellion. As the majormainstream media today is under the domination of a mere handful ofmultinational corporations, there will be little investigation of the potentialdangers of surveillance, and what reporting there is will likely be mereassurances that spy programs are for our protection. Critics are concerned thatsuch surveillance may be used to identify and round up dissidents whengovernment policies and the economy reach a breaking point.Ironically enough, such intrusive surveillance and security methods apparentlyapply only to honest, tax-paying Americans, not to lawbreakers.In mid-2014, the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) revealed that many of thethousands of illegal immigrants crossing the Texas-Mexico border were beingallowed to bypass TSA scrutiny and board and fly commercial airliners and busesby simply presenting an easily faked government document.Illegals caught entering the USA are issued an “Application for Asylum and forWithholding of Removal” form (I-862) from the U.S. Citizenship and ImmigrationServices (USCIS), referring them to an immigration judge at some future date.This form can be used for identification purposes. “This just adds insult toinjury,” complained Hector Garza, a spokesman for NBPC’s Local 2455. “Not onlyare we releasing unknown illegal aliens onto American streets, but we areallowing them to travel commercially using paperwork that could easily bereproduced or manipulated on any home computer . . . The [I-862] Notice toAppear form has no photo, anyone can make one and manipulate one . . . We do notknow who these people are, we often have to solely rely on who they say theyare, where they say they came from, and the history they say they have. We knownothing about most of them.”Modern America can truly be described as a nation more and more closely matchingthe nightmarish Big Brother world of Orwell, complete with cameras and listeningdevices in both public places and private homes. Personal privacy appears to bea thing of the past, as more than a year after Snowden revealed thecontroversial practice of monitoring telephone calls, U.S. intelligence agenciescontinue attempting to extend their bulk collection of American telephonerecords. In June 2014, the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court(FISA) for the fifth time approved a request from the NSA that allowed theagency a ninety-day extension on its collection of metadata.James Clapper, director of national intelligence, said the extension wasnecessary because the congressional reform process supported by Obama was notyet complete. Many researchers expressed doubt that such reforms wouldsubstantially alter government spying.Well into 2014, President Obama was still formulating plans to overhaul NSA’stelephone surveillance program. However, some U.S. officials claimed that thechanges envisioned could actually compel telecommunications companies to collectand store customer data not previously required by law.The Obama administration’s plan would require carriers—not the NSA—to collectand store phone metadata, including dialed numbers and call lengths, though notthe actual content of conversations. This could force companies to create newmechanisms to ensure that metadata from flat-rate subscribers could bemonitored. According to one industry source, “These are very complex systems. Idoubt there are companies out there that have a nice, neat, single database thatcan tell you how long records are kept universally.”Verizon Communications’ general counsel Randal Milch in a blog, while applaudingproposals to end Section 215 (of the PATRIOT Act) bulk collection, argued that“the reformed collection process should not require companies to store data forlonger than, or in formats that differ from, what they already do for businesspurposes.” In other words, keep the status quo.Amid such concerns, yet another NSA whistle-blower spoke at a July 2014conference organized by the Centre of Investigative Journalism in London andrevealed the NSA’s ultimate goal. William Binney, a former NSA code breakerduring the Cold War, resigned shortly after the 9/11 attacks in disgust over theagency’s mass surveillance activities. Binney is said to be one of thehighest-ranking whistle-blowers to come out of the NSA.Binney said that while he is encouraged by recent Supreme Court decisions, suchas the one requiring law enforcement officials to obtain a search warrant beforedownloading cell-phone data, “the ultimate goal of the NSA is total populationcontrol.”“At least 80 percent of fiber-optic cables globally go via the U.S.,” hereported. “This is no accident and allows the U.S. to view all communicationcoming in. At least 80 percent of all audio calls, not just metadata, arerecorded and stored in the U.S. The NSA lies about what it stores. The NSA ismass-collecting on everyone and it’s said to be about terrorism, but inside theU.S. it has stopped zero attacks,” he added.Binney also expressed concern over the lack of oversight by the secret ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISA). “The FISA court has only thegovernment’s point of view,” he noted. “There are no other views for the judgesto consider. There have been at least fifteen to twenty trillion constitutionalviolations for U.S. domestic audiences and you can double that globally.”And the violations have expanded from collection of technological records intoother facets of life. In early 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)was poised to activate a national license-plate tracking system shared withlocal law enforcement that would allow DHS officers to take smartphone photos ofany license. These images then could uploaded to a national database that wouldinclude a “hot list” of “target vehicles.” Similar surveillance systems inBritain and Australia have drawn criticism from civil libertarians. DavidJancik, writing in Australia’s Courier-Mail, comments, “The increasing use ofnumber plate recognition technology by police opens a Pandora’s box for abuse ofpower, mistakes and illegal disclosure. In a society that values civilliberties, this is absolutely unacceptable.”Many citizens are seriously concerned about the possibility of unauthorizedabuse of such a system. “Do not kid yourself,” warned James Smith with thePrepper Podcast Radio Network. “This is tracking of an individual that can beaccessed at a whim. Yearly, officers are terminated for accessing the LEDS/NCICdatabase for looking into the histories of ex-lovers, future spouses, andpotential son-/daughter-in-laws . . . And with a license plate tracking toy (nota tool), they will know where you are, as long as you have driven into the crosshairs of this new weapon for tyranny.”And the surveillance state has expanded into areas that once were confined tothe realm of science fiction. In September 2014, the FBI announced that its NextGeneration Identification (NGI) facial recognition system was “fullyoperational,” ahead of schedule, despite claims the system identifies the wrongindividual about 20 percent of the time. Minnesota Democratic senator Al Frankenwarned that the NGI system “could be abused to not only identify protesters atpolitical events and rallies, but to target them for selective jailing andprosecution.” A spokesman for the FBI said the NGI system, used by lawenforcement agencies across the nation, was not expected to provide accurateinformation on a suspect but merely return a list of possible “candidates” asinvestigative leads. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request by theElectronic Frontier Foundation, the FBI provided documents revealing that itsNGI system may include images of as many as fifty-two million Americans’ faces.By the end of 2015, the FBI’s entire biometric database may contain fingerprintor facial information on more than a third of the U.S. population.Under such an inaccurate system, a person could be arrested, taken off thestreet, and held for some time because merely because they look like a wantedcriminal.Already, state and local law enforcement agencies use a wide variety of facialimagery databases to identify suspects. These include driver’s licenses andFacebook photos.The spread of such police state technology moved ahead in early 2015, as the LosAngeles County Sheriff’s Department—the fourth largest police agency in thecountry—signed a $24 million contract to create a biometric database second onlyto that of the FBI.Officials with Texas-based NEC Corporation of America, which provides biometricservices to corporations, law enforcement, and governments across the world—saidits six-year Los Angeles contract calls for providing the agency withspecialized, state-of-the-art policing services, to include high-techfingerprint and facial recognition software.The new biometric service will interface with databases maintained by outsideagencies including the FBI’s NGI system, according to NEC officials. Althoughsheriff’s officers have assured the public that no biometric data will becollected on innocent Los Angeles citizens, only on those arrested and chargedwith a crime, it was noted that criminal charges do not always lead to aconviction. Civil libertarians are concerned that millions of records onnoncriminal Californians might potentially end up in the database.The U.S. State Department is said to hold the largest facial imagery database inthe federal government, storing hundreds of millions of photographs of Americanpassport holders and foreign visa applicants. The Department of HomelandSecurity funds pilot projects in local police departments that match suspects’faces against those in crowd photographs.According to NSA documents obtained in 2011 from former contractor EdwardSnowden, the agency intercepts about fifty-five thousand “facial recognitionquality images” out of millions captured each day. Agency officials termed thisphoto cache a “tremendous untapped potential” for cataloging every citizen. Thispotential was revealed by the Guardian, which disclosed that the NSA, along withits British counterpart, General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), hadintercepted webcam images from Yahoo subscribers, including sexually explicitmaterial.Such technology is still evolving, but already suspects can be identified evenafter growing a beard, changing locations, or trying to disappear within acrowd. Those concerned with civil liberties have expressed grave doubts aboutfuture privacy because of this constantly improving technology. AlessandroAcquisti, a researcher on facial recognition technology at Carnegie MellonUniversity, warned, “There are still technical limitations on it, but thecomputational power keeps growing, and the databases keep growing, and thealgorithms keep improving.”Legislators have been slow to address this issue. Senator Franken, a formerchairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, in a2013 letter to the head of the National Telecommunications and InformationAdministration (NTIA), remarked, “Unfortunately, our privacy laws provide noexpress protections for facial recognition data.” The NTIA has contemplatedstandards and regulation for commercial use but not when it comes to the federalgovernment.The Next Generation Information system combines many different types of data inan individual’s file, including such personal and biographic data as name, homeaddress, Social Security (i.e., your computer number), immigration status, age,race, etc. This vast database is shared with the approximately eighteen thousandstate, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies across the United States aswell as other federal agencies. Unlike in the past, the NGI system will linkboth criminal and noncriminal databases.As this database continues to grow, so also will its use. It is anticipated thatsoon employers requiring fingerprinting or a background check for job applicantswill turn to the NGI system. “One of our biggest concerns about NGI has been thefact that it will include noncriminal as well as criminal face images. We nowknow that FBI projects that by 2015, the database will include 4.3 millionimages taken for noncriminal purposes,” states Jennifer Lynch, a seniorElectronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney.When it was found that the resolution of many of the facial recognition photoswas unacceptably low, FBI officials were quick to point out that its database isfor investigative leads, not identification. This position prompted Lynch toask, “It is unclear what happens when [a suspect] does not exist in thegallery—does NGI still return possible matches? Could those people then besubject to criminal investigation for no other reason than that a computerthought their face was mathematically similar to a suspect’s?”It should be noted that the company behind NGI’s facial recognition database isMorphoTrust, a subsidiary of Safran, the French multinational firm dealing inaviation and aerospace products as well as security. MorphoTrust has placedfacial recognition systems in approximately thirty-five state motor vehicledepartments and in the Departments of Defense and State, which share recordswith the FBI.The potential for mistakes in this giant web of databases, which now includeslocal jurisdictions such as the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Office, is anuncomfortable reality for many.And, as if checking license plates and citizens’ faces with readers and streetcameras were not enough, the government in early 2014 announced the deploymentof the U.S. Army’s Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated NettedSensor System (JLENS), a tethered blimp capable of detecting airborne objects upto 340 miles away and surface vehicles up to 140 miles away. According to onereport, the blimp can view most of the Eastern Seaboard, from as far south asRichmond, as far west as Cumberland, Maryland, and as far north as StatenIsland. Such airborne devices, now undergoing trials in the U.S., have been usedfor surveillance in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and along the U.S.-Mexico border.ACLU privacy expert Jay Stanley told the Washington Post that the spy blimpsrepresent “the kind of massive persistent surveillance we’ve always beenconcerned about with drones. It’s part of this trend we’ve seen since 9/11,which is the turning inward of all of these surveillance technologies.” In thepast, defense systems such as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) line were aimedtoward Russia. Today, they seem to be guarding against internal threats ratherthan foreign ones. Army spokespersons attempted to assuage any concern over theblimp monitoring by stating, “The primary mission . . . is to track airborneobjects. Its secondary mission is to track surface moving objects such asvehicles or boats. The capability to track surface objects does not extend toindividual people.”However the EFF’s Lynch notes, “If it’s able to track vehicles, that isproblematic. You could imagine a scenario in which the location information canreveal where you go to church, what doctor you’re going to, whether you’recheating on your wife, all those types of details . . . Once a surveillancetechnology is put up, it’s very tempting for law enforcement or the military touse it for reasons they did not originally disclose.”The surveillance state now reaches into every aspect of our lives, includingsocial media. Many of the more than one billion Facebook users would behorrified to learn that the NSA has co-opted the website in order to monitorcitizens who have not been accused of any crime. According to internalgovernment documents leaked by Snowden and reported by journalists RyanGallagher and Glenn Greenwald, “In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fakeFacebook server, using the social media site as a launching pad to infect atarget’s computer and exfiltrate files from a hard drive. In others, it has sentout spam emails laced with malware, which can be tailored to covertly recordaudio from a computer’s microphone and take snapshots with its webcam.The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch cyber attacks bycorrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites.Gallagher and Greenwald, after studying NSA documents made available by Snowden,reported that before the NSA can extract data from a target, it must installmalware on a targeted computer or network. “According to one top-secret documentfrom 2012, the agency can deploy malware by sending out spam emails that tricktargets into clicking a malicious link,” they wrote. “Once activated, a‘backdoor implant’ infects their computers within eight seconds. There’s onlyone problem with this tactic, code-named WILLOWVIXEN: According to thedocuments, the spam method has become less successful in recent years, asInternet users have become wary of unsolicited emails and less likely to clickon anything that looks suspicious,” they wrote. “Consequently, the NSA hasturned to new and more advanced hacking techniques. These include performingso-called man-in-the-middle and man-on-the-side attacks, which covertly force auser’s Internet browser to route to NSA computer servers that try to infect themwith an implant.”The technical capability of the government, and the nefarious ends to which itis being put, is enough to drive the average person to the outer limits ofparanoia. Government officials argue that these are unfortunate but necessitytools to fight terrorism. Yet the written evidence left by a number of NSAemployees tells a vastly different story.One unnamed official in the NSA’s Signals Intelligence Directorate (SIGINT)posted his thoughts on a NSA discussion board that were included in a documentreleased by Snowden. He wrote: “So, SIGINT is down right [sic] cool. As much aswe complain about our ‘Big Data Problem,’ collection/processing issues, dismalinfrastructure/outdated browsers/OS’s [operating systems], our ability to pullbits out of random places of the internet, bring them back to the mother-base toevaluate and build intelligence off of them is just plain awesome!“One of the coolest things about it is how much [emphasis in the original] datawe have at our fingertips. If we ‘only’ collected the data we knew we wanted . .. yeah, we’d fill some of our requirements, but this is a whole world ofpossibilities we’d be missing! It would be like going on a road-trip, butwearing a blindfold the entire time, and only removing it when you’re at one ofyour destinations . . . yeah, you’ll see stuff, but you’ll be missing out on theentire journey.”In another post, this government official admitted that the NSA “hunts” systemadministrators who control computer networks and servers, then targets theirprivate email and Facebook accounts to gather information useful for hackinginto their computers and gaining access to the entire network of computers theycontrol.And for all the liberties we have lost, this mass surveillance program is noteven particularly effective. A 2014 study of terrorism cases by the New AmericaFoundation showed that the NSA massive phone record collection has beenvirtually useless in preventing terrorist attacks.The report states, “An in-depth analysis of 225 individuals recruited byal-Qaeda or a like-minded group or inspired by al-Qaeda’s ideology, and chargedin the United States with an act of terrorism since 9/11, demonstrates thattraditional investigative methods, such as the use of informants, tips fromlocal communities, and targeted intelligence operations, provided the initialimpetus for investigations in the majority of cases, while the contribution ofNSA’s bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal. Indeed, thecontroversial bulk collection of American telephone metadata, which includes thetelephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and dateof those calls but not their content, under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act,appears to have played an identifiable role in initiating, at most, 1.8 percentof these cases.”In Europe, privacy advocates have had somewhat more success in curtailingsurveillance by national governments. On April 8, 2014, the European Union Courtof Justice struck down an online data collection directive issued by the EUclaiming it “interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamentalrights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data.” Thiswas a blow to the intelligence agencies of both the UK and the U.S., which haveoperated under a 2006 Data Retention Directive requiring telecommunicationscompanies to keep citizens’ data up to two years. It was claimed such retentionof data is “a necessary and effective investigative tool for law enforcement inseveral Member States, and in particular concerning serious matters such asorganized crime and terrorism, it is necessary to ensure that retained data aremade available to law enforcement authorities for a certain period.”Privacy International, a London-based group dedicated to fighting for theprivacy rights around the world, issued a statement saying, “It is right andoverdue that this terrible directive was struck down.“This ruling not only demolishes communications data surveillance laws acrossEurope, but sets a precedent for the world. The widespread and indiscriminatecollection of information has been, and always will be, bad law, inconsistentwith human rights and democratic values. What the [whistle-blower Edward]Snowden revelations have showed us over the past year is that the internationalsurveillance apparatus set up by intelligence agencies is in direct conflictwith human rights. If the Data Retention Directive fails to meet therequirements of human rights law, then the mass surveillance programs operatedby the U.S. and UK governments must equally be in conflict with the right toprivacy . . . the international surveillance apparatus set up by intelligenceagencies is in direct conflict with human rights.”Yet the EU still has a long way to go. It’s telling that even Angela Merkel,chancellor of Germany, a close U.S. ally, in 2014 was denied access to her NSAfile. And the Obama administration, despite assurances in late 2013 that theU.S. was no longer monitoring Merkel’s phone calls, stated it would not answerformal questions from the Germans regarding NSA surveillance. Obama’s governmentalso refused to enter into a mutual “no-spy” agreement with Germany, sayingBerlin was unwilling or unable to share the kinds of surveillance material theAmericans requested.In Europe, as in the United States, the most successful resistance has been atthe individual level, as a few average citizens have begun to fight the “BigBrother” tactics of the surveillance state. In early 2014, a thirteen-year-oldstudent in Wales fought back against increasingly common school surveillance bydonning a mask representing Guy Fawkes, the English revolutionary convicted inthe Gunpowder Plot of 1605, and now the most visible symbol of a collection ofdissenters known as Anonymous. The girl refused to be fingerprinted as herschool demanded. When a school employee tried to place her hand on a scanner,she withdrew it and stated that neither she nor her parents had given theirconsent.Her mother told Digital Journal: “Of all the children in Melody’s class only afew refused to be fingerprinted; the majority signed. I personally find thisalarming. These are children not cattle, not convicted criminals—innocentchildren whose prints are now in the system. Anonymous unites people from everyreligion and country; never have I seen anything bring people together the waythis does, people from all over suddenly put aside the feuds created by ourgovernments, and are friends. There becomes a sense of being human and caringfor one another that you simply do not get on such a wide scale; they are outthere feeding the homeless, or fighting for justice for the people who have hadtheir voices taken away forever. You can either be part of the solution orremain part of the problem.”Melody’s case illustrates a broader issue in British schools. Despite a clausein the UK’s Protection of Freedoms Act of 2012 guaranteeing parents that theirpermission would be asked before biometric data was taken from a child, it wasestimated that roughly a third of Britain’s schoolchildren have been duped intosubmitting to fingerprinting without parental consent. The civil liberties groupBig Brother Watch submitted Freedom of Information requests to more than threethousand British schools and found about 40 percent were using this biometricaltechnology.More fuel was added to this fire of outrage when Sky News reported that a classof three-year-olds in England was cajoled into giving fingerprints by being toldit was a “spy game.” One official defended the practice by claiming thefingerprints were intended for use in attendance reporting, along with verifyingaccess to meals and libraries. It was said that prints were destroyed oncepupils left the school.Some have expressed the fear that the UK has been used as a testing ground forthe global elite. After the successful introduction of fingerprinting forschoolchildren in Britain, the practice spread to the U.S. In 1999, Eagan HighSchool in Minnesota encouraged students to use fingerprint readers to speed upthe borrowing of library books. This was followed the next year by a schooldistrict in Pennsylvania where a local software development company designed asystem whereby students bought lunch with just a fingerprint.Children, with no real knowledge of history or privacy, are naively accepting ofsuch new technology. “You don’t have to bring lunch money. So, somebody can’ttake it,” exulted one thirteen-year-old student.Oddly enough, while the practice of fingerprinting schoolchildren has continuedto grow in the UK and America, it has stopped in China, a nation long vilifiedin the Western media as a communist dictatorship with no respect for individualliberties or privacy. In 2006, Roderick Woo, justice of the peace at the HongKong Office of the Privacy Commission, ordered some schools to stopfingerprinting children. The schools in Kowloon District were ordered to destroyall fingerprint data from students.Woo explained, “It was a contravention of our law, which is very similar to yourlaw, which is that the function of the school is not to collect data in thismanner, that it was excessive and that there was a less privacy-intrusive methodto use.” He asked what better way is there for a teacher to take roll than tolook around the class, note who’s missing, and take down their names for therecord. “Measuring fingerprints seemed a little over the top for the task inhand,” he added.Yet in America, allegedly the land of the free, such policies persist. To befair, we have recently seen a few stirrings of resistance. In Houston, forexample, when the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) announced a plan toinvite the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to randomly search bagsand packages, local citizens and libertarian attorneys were quick to offeropposition. After heated citizen input—Derrick Broze told the MTA board, “Idon’t feel like by purchasing a ticket or riding a bus [and having] to forfeitmy constitutional rights and my protections and be subject to search or seizure.We don’t plan on letting this issue die if the TSA stays in our city.” Boardchairman Gilbert Garcia said the press release was in error and that his agencyhad not conducted random bag searches on its buses and trains and did not planto do so. However, Garcia later modified his statement, saying MTA officersmight search bags but only based on probable cause or with a rider’s consent.The episode illustrated that citizen protests in this arena can, occasionally,make a difference.Similar security intrusion took place when the Massachusetts Bay TransportationAuthority (MBTA) announced that all Boston bus and subway riders must submit toa warrantless search prior to boarding. Signage at a Boston “Transit Watch”checkpoint stated that “all persons choosing to use the MBTA transit system willbe subject to security inspections of their handbags, briefcases and/or othercarry-on items.” The notice went on to state that anyone refusing a securityinspection would be requested to leave MBTA property and/or be subject to arrestfor trespassing.Yet despite a few citizen protests, the U.S. court system seems less motivatedthan that in the EU to begin to dismantle intrusive surveillance techniques.Again, it appears that the only hope for private citizens is to deviseworkarounds of their own devising. Internet users have found ways to bypassgovernment surveillance by using nontraditional search engines, such asStartpage, ixquick, and DuckDuckGo, billed as “the search engine that doesn’ttrack you.”Duck founder Gabriel Weinberg said he named the search site after Duck, Duck,Goose, a circular-chase children’s playground game. Since DuckDuckGo doesn’tstore previous searches, it does not and cannot present personalized searchresults. Weinberg said this frees users from the filter bubble—the fear that, assearch results are increasingly personalized, they are less likely to bepresented with information that challenges their existing ideas. He added thatwith no data storage, unlike other search engines, his site does not create apersonal profile, thus becoming an advertising tool.Weinberg said his opposition to widespread data gathering is philosophical. “Ithink of it as more privacy policy than general. I think [search engines] shouldbe set up to be the minimal collection as needed, as opposed to the maximalcollection possible. The other way to look at that is I think they should have aquid pro quo, which is ‘you’re giving up this particular piece of personalinformation and you’re getting this benefit in return,’ as opposed to thecurrent status quo, which is ‘we will collect anything we can and not tell youwhat the benefits are,’ just say, in general, ‘sure, you’ll benefit from this.’I think that is the key difference. And you’ve seen some companies start to moveto this direction, but very slowly.” Weinberg’s site apparently has struck anerve with security-conscious Web surfers: DuckDuckGo handled more than abillion queries in 2013 alone.In his classic book Nineteen Eighty-Four, British author George Orwell’sprotagonist Winston Smith was concerned about his television set, which receivedand transmitted simultaneously and recorded any sound above a low whisper. Henever knew if he was being watched at any given moment. “You have to live—didlive, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound youmade was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized,” wroteOrwell.This picture of life in Orwell’s fictional totalitarian state was published in1948 yet seems eerily prescient of life in America today.If the citizens of today do not begin to strenuously object to the ever-growingsurveillance and intrusiveness of the police state and demand changes from theirleaders, their children and grandchildren will grow up in an Orwellianauthoritarian nightmare mostly unaware of true freedom and liberty."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-33]THE MILITARIZATION OF POLICE [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-33]POLITICIANS REFUSE TO USE POLICE OR MILITARY FORCES TO FORTIFY and protect U.S.borders, but within the country’s boundaries it seems that anything goes. Policeforces are being armed with surplus war materials to tyrannize the civilianpopulation, and even some school districts are accumulating military equipmentfor campus police.There was a time in America when only criminals were fearful of the police. Butthat helpful public servant, that man in blue sworn to “serve and protect,” hastoday been replaced by a black-clad, body-armored, and heavily armed enforcementofficer who generally views ordinary public citizens as “perps.” Increasingly,many young police officers and even entire law enforcement departments arearming and training as if they expect to be going to war with the Americanpeople.This phenomenon has been encouraged at the federal level. Much of themilitarization stems from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the Pentagon’slargest organization for the logistical support of U.S. military services aswell as civilian law enforcement. The DLA is headquartered in Fort Belvoir,Virginia, and employs twenty-seven thousand people. The DLA, under the 1033program begun in 1990, is charged with disposing of $28 billion worth ofmilitary equipment per year. Its Law Enforcement Support Office estimates thatabout eight thousand state and local police agencies have received billions inhardware since 1997. Much of this hardware became surplus as both the missionsand materials of the military changed through the years. The pace ofmilitarization increased significantly after the 9/11 attacks.Frank Scafidi, director of public affairs for the National Insurance CrimeBureau, says, “The government has done a pretty good job since 9/11 of beatinginto our heads all of the nasty things that could befall us at any moment—from aterrorist threat. Cops like nothing more than grabbing onto some cool new (tothem, at least) piece of hardware—especially when it was obtained at no cost.But then what? If the gear is in the inventory and an occasion to use itdevelops, you can bet that it will be used. And why not?”According to Pentagon data, during the Obama years the military combat equipmentreceived by police departments includes 432 MRAPs (Mine Resistant AmbushProtected) vehicles; 435 other armored vehicles; 44,900 night-vision goggles,sights, and lights; 533 planes and helicopters; and 93,763 machine guns. Policedepartments also have received nearly 200,000 ammunition magazines, thousands ofpieces of camouflage and hundreds of silencers. And the federal governmentprovides not only weapons and heavy equipment, but also a vast array of moremundane items, including office furniture, cleaning supplies, power tools,computers, and even disparate items such as an exercise bike, a treadmill, andrefrigerators.According to New York Times reporter Matt Apuzzo, “The equipment has been addedto the armories of police departments that already look and act like militaryunits. Police SWAT teams are now deployed tens of thousands of times each year,increasingly for routine jobs. Masked, heavily armed police officers inLouisiana raided a nightclub in 2006 as part of a liquor inspection. In Floridain 2010, officers in SWAT gear and with guns drawn carried out raids onbarbershops that mostly led only to charges of ‘barbering without a license.’”Such militarization has even reached into some schools. According to aninvestigation by Houston, Texas, television station KHOU, ten Texas schooldistricts have availed themselves of the free or low-cost military hardware fromthe Pentagon, including M16 rifles, M14 rifles, automatic pistols, tacticalvests, and even military vehicles. Even though Spring Hills School Districtpolice chief Charles Brawner explained that such weapons would be available onlyto tactically trained officers in the event of an emergency, critics questionthe need for such heavy armament. “We’ve seen how even much-less-lethal deviceslike Tasers and pepper spray get used inappropriately and end up harmingchildren,” remarked Brennan Griffin of Texas Appleseed, a group that monitorscampus police policies.Citizens, outraged over such militarization, are pushing back. After hearingcitizen concerns, the city council of Davis, California, a small college townnear Sacramento, directed the police chief to get rid of a $700,000 armored car.Mayor Dan Wolk said, “It’s the kind of thing that is used in Afghanistan andIraq. Our community is the kind of community that is not going to take well tohaving this kind of vehicle. We are not a crime-ridden city. When it comes tohelp from Washington we, like most communities, have a long wish list. But atank, or MRAP, or whatever you choose to call it, is not on that list.”Even some cops are concerned. As retired New York police detective John Baezaputs it, “A profession that I was once proud to serve in has become amilitarized police state. Officers are quicker to draw their guns and use theirtanks than to communicate with people to defuse a situation. They love to usetheir toys, and when they do, people die. The days of the peace officer are longgone, replaced by the militarized police warrior wearing uniforms making themindistinguishable from military personnel.”William Norman Grigg, a columnist for LewRockwell.com, notes that the 1033program specifies that any law enforcement agency receiving military equipmentmust use it within a year or return it. “If a police department wants combatgear, it can get it, and once the department has that gear, it will use it. Infact, the feds will require that they invent a ‘need’ where none exists. Thishelps explain why routine police calls are now treated as potential militaryengagements,” writes Grigg.Some law enforcement agencies obtain military gear out of fear of beingoutgunned by criminals, while others simply want to emulate the militarizedforces they see on TV and in films. Ominously, an 2014 investigation by the TVand digital network Fusion revealed that 184 state and local police departmentshad been suspended from the 1033 program because of missing weapons or failureto comply with guidelines. “We uncovered a pattern of missing M14 and M16assault rifles across the country, as well as instances of missing .45-caliberpistols, shotguns and two cases of missing Humvee vehicles,” write Daniel Riveroand Jorge Rivas.Tim Lynch, director of the CATO Institute’s Project on Criminal Justice, saysthe 1033 program is “obviously very sloppy, and it’s another reason thatCongress needs to revisit this promptly. We don’t know where these weapons aregoing, whether they are really lost, or whether there is corruption involved.”Lynch found the possibility that these military weapons were being sold on theblack market “very unsettling.” Investigations into missing weapons have beencontinuing in 2015.Nowhere has the militarization of police been more blatantly on display than inthe violence that erupted in August 2014 in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.Tensions there mounted following the police shooting of eighteen-year-oldMichael Brown, and when demonstrators from the black community took to thestreets to protest, they were met by heavily armed and armored police in fullbattle gear. Jake Tapper of CNN reported that there was no violence and lootinguntil police began using tear gas and stun grenades. “Nobody is threateninganything,” reported Tapper. “Nobody is doing anything. None of the stores herethat I can see are being looted. There is no violence.”Tapper turned his camera to the unit of police and added, “These are armedpolice. With machine—not machine guns—semiautomatic rifles, with batons, withshields, many of them dressed for combat. Now, why they’re doing this, I don’tknow. Because there is no threat going on here. None that merits this.”Comparing the scene to military action in Afghanistan, Tapper reported, “Thereis nothing going on on this street right now that merits this scene out ofBagram. Nothing. So if people wonder why the people of Ferguson, Missouri, areso upset, this is part of the reason. What is this? This doesn’t make anysense.”Frederick Reese, writing for MintPressNews, agreed that the massive policeresponse did more to aggravate than to improve the situation. “Theresponse—which included the targeting and arrest of journalists—is proof of theElaborated Social Identity Model [ESIM], which suggests that a group of angrypeople can either be goaded into a riot or defused, depending on how they aretreated by police. The impression of the police officer screaming at the crowdwith his rifle raised—as has been seen on multiple occasions in Fergusonrecently—is as much responsible for the rioting as the protestors themselves,according to ESIM. It is also, in part, a reflection of the notion that ‘if theonly tool you have is a hammer, you treat everything as a nail.’”Lost in the mass media coverage of the unrest in Ferguson was a similar shootingdeath of twenty-year-old white man in Salt Lake City on August 11. This deathalso caused public demonstrations yet the police response was quite different.Dillon Taylor, along with his brother and a cousin, were confronted by citypolice outside a convenience store. Ordered to stop, Taylor continued walkingand was fatally shot in the chest after police claimed he reached into hiswaistband. The officer who shot him was “non-white,” according to Salt Lake Citypolice chief Chris Burbank, in response to concerns of racial profiling giventhat Dillon Taylor was Hispanic..Jerrail Taylor said his brother was wearing earphones and did not realize whatwas happening and that Dillon was reaching for his cell phone. “He got confused,he went to pull up his pants to get on the ground, and they shot him,” he toldthe media. Adding to the questions over Taylor death was the fact that policefound no weapons at the scene and later released Taylor’s brother and cousinwithout charges.Chief Burbank also caused concern when he announced that the policeman who shotTaylor was wearing a body camera that recorded the entire affair, but hedeclined to make it public, saying, “It would be wholly inappropriate to takethe most vital piece of evidence that we have and put it out to the public priorto the officer having some due process.”During the following week, demonstrators marched in Salt Lake City to protestwhat they felt was a wrongful shooting by police but the comparison between thisevent and those in Ferguson was stark. Unlike Ferguson, there was no rioting orlooting and the police presence was kept minimal. “If we show up wearing riotgear it says throw rocks and boulders at us,” explained Burbank. “I didn’t sendofficers out wearing riot gear to talk to the protesters who were out in frontof the building yesterday.”The difference in protests as well as the police response was not lost on somecommentators. “While friends of Taylor and some others have protested theshooting, there have been no riots or violence, no radicals streaming in toagitate, no national media interest at all, and complete indifference from theA[ttorney] G[General] and POTUS [President of the United States], in starkcontrast to their concern for the late strong-arm robber Michael Brown,” wroteThomas Lifson in the Internet publication American Thinker. “It is hard toescape the conclusion that some unarmed victims of police shootings are moreimportant to the political and media leadership of America than others.”Two thousand and eight Constitutional Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwinrelates an experience that to him showed the change of attitude in the policemanof today. “True story,” he writes, “here in Montana, a small town policeofficer, who is assigned to the traffic division, was asked to speak to a churchgroup. Mostly, he gives out traffic citations for minor violations. As he beganhis remarks, he said, ‘I am a cop; I work every day among the dregs of society.’Really? People who get parking tickets and speeding tickets are the ‘dregs’ ofsociety? That, my friends, is the mark of an unfolding police-state mentality.And, remember, this is from the heart and lips of a professing Christian.”In an open letter to “my friends in law enforcement,” Baldwin wrote, “As honestand honorable as most of you men and women of law enforcement are, it is timethat you come to grips with the fact that the current system emanating fromWashington, D.C., controlling the attitudes, training, and tactics of policeagencies is practically a carbon copy of history’s most notorious totalitarianregimes. And if the Nuremberg trials proved anything, they proved that ‘I wasjust following orders’ is never justification for ignoring the greater morallaws of God and Nature.“My dad told me that the policeman is my friend. I would still like to believethat; but it behooves my friends in law enforcement to prove it to me bypersonally making up your minds to vehemently resist the current trend ofmilitarizing your profession and of turning our once-free republic into a policestate. After all, you want us to be your friends, too, right?”The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), in a 2012 report,claimed that police use of force is rare. The IACP said less than 2 percent ofthe forty million people who had contact with police in 2008 reported the use offorce or the threatened use of force. “In large part, the public perception ofpolice use of force is framed and influenced by the media depictions whichpresent unrealistic and often outlandish representations of law enforcement andthe policing profession,” the group stated in its report.Yet, even 2 percent of forty million is eight hundred thousand, and since 2010the U.S. Justice Department has opened more than twenty investigations intopolice departments across the country. Fifteen departments accepted consentdecrees, including ones in New Orleans, Seattle, and Portland. Several otherdepartments reached out-of-court agreements, while four police agencies thatrejected the DOJ findings found themselves facing lawsuits. A March 2015 JusticeDepartment report found the Ferguson police had established a pattern ofconstitutional violations due to city officials pressing for more aggressive lawenforcement to generate revenues. The investigation into the Ferguson PoliceDepartment was continuing in early 2015.Critics have pointed out that the aggressiveness of police has substantiallyincreased in recent years concurrent with the use of military hardware.Thoughtful people wonder why police need tanks and armored cars to catchspeeders, shoplifters, or burglars.A 2014 ACLU study entitled “War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization ofAmerican Policing” concludes, “Across the country, heavily armed Special Weaponsand Tactics (SWAT) teams are forcing their way into people’s homes in the middleof the night, often deploying explosive devices such as flash-bang grenades totemporarily blind and deafen residents, simply to serve a search warrant on thesuspicion that someone may be in possession of a small amount of drugs.Neighborhoods are not war zones, and our police officers should not be treatingus like wartime enemies. However, the ACLU encountered this type of story overand over when studying the militarization of state and local law enforcementagencies.”This study substantiates the fact that police tactics nationwide are becoming“unnecessarily and dangerously militarized,” mostly through federal programsproviding military equipment to police agencies. It also found that the use ofmilitary equipment and tactics, which it called a “pervasive problem,” wasprimarily being used against “communities of color.”“Historians looking back at this period in America’s development will considerit to be profoundly odd that at the exact moment when violent crime hit afifty-year low, the nation’s police departments began to gear up as if thecountry were expecting invasion—and, on occasion, to behave as if one were underway,” wrote Charles C. W. Cooke in National Review.com.One example of the militarization of the nation’s police forces, all now anational force under the control of the Department of Homeland Security, may befound in the small town of Neenah, Wisconsin. This quiet town of abouttwenty-five thousand has not recorded a homicide in more than five years, yettoday is the proud owner of a thirty-ton MRAP combat vehicle. Neenah citycouncilman William Pollnow Jr. questioned the necessity for the MRAP but wastold it was needed to protect police. “Who’s going to be against that? You’reagainst the police coming home safe at night? But you can always present aworst-case scenario. You can use that as a framework to get anything,” he said.“Somebody has to be the first person to say ‘Why are we doing this?’”It is with notable irony that while U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan early onwere sent into combat with old-style jeeps and Humvees susceptible todestruction by improvised explosive devices (IEDs), local police forces are nowbeing equipped with the new armored fighting vehicles during a time of relativepeace in the country. In fact, while national leaders do everything they can toreduce the number of firearms in the hands of the citizenry, massive amounts ofmilitary hardware are being handed over to local police forces. Many wonder ifthis is simply a means of reusing old equipment in preparation for the purchaseof newer models or if someone is preparing for major violence in America.Some researchers find it more than coincidental that the militarization of thenation’s police coincided with heightened public awareness of the globalists’designs and public debate concerning what President George H. W. Bush describedas the “New World Order.”It should be further noted that the aggressiveness of police has followedtraining by Israeli antiterrorism experts, as will be detailed further on.All this militarization began in the 1990s when Congress, sidestepping the 1878Posse Comitatus Law that prohibits the U.S. military from policing the Americanpublic, authorized a military transfer program to aid local police againstwell-armed drug gangs. This delivery of military equipment continues today,although FBI statistics show crime has fallen to its lowest levels in ageneration.Police departments across the nation say they are simply preparing forworst-case scenarios by building up combat equipment. Captain Tiger Parsons ofthe Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office in northwest Missouri, which now possessesa mine-resistant truck, says, “When you explain that you’re preparing forsomething that may never happen, they get it.” But not everyone agreed. PoliceChief Ronald E. Teachman of South Bend, Indiana, declined the offer of amine-resistant vehicle for his city. “I go to schools, but [instead of a warmachine] I bring Green Eggs and Ham.”It is true that with the possible exception of certain large cities, the vastmajority of the nation’s officers have not, and most probably will not, fire aweapon in a real-life situation. But they all have been conditioned by cop showson TV to anticipate high-speed chases and gun battles as normal dailyactivities. No longer do police officers present themselves at a person’s doorand respectfully ask questions after showing proper identification. Today manycitizens, whether guilty of some crime or not, are rudely awakened bybusted-down doors and pointed guns in the hands of an armored SWAT team."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-35]THE RISE OF SWAT TEAMS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-35]SINCE THE EARLY 1980S, THE USE OF SWAT (SPECIAL WEAPONS and Tactics) teams hasdramatically increased by more than 1,500 percent. A significant portion of thisincrease can be attributed to search and arrest warrants related to drug cases.And the nature of SWAT use, which has been encouraged by federal fundingincentives, has changed as well.According to a 2014 ACLU report, SWAT teams in the United States conduct aroundforty-five thousand raids each year, only 7 percent of which have anything to dowith the hostage situations that were the original impetus for the creation ofthe teams. The ACLU reports that paramilitary operations are “happening in about124 homes every day—or more likely every night—and four in five of those areperformed in order that authorities might search homes, usually for drugs.”These raids routinely involve armored personnel carriers, military equipmentlike battering rams, and flash-bang grenades.The ACLU studied eight hundred deployments of SWAT teams among twenty local,state, and federal police agencies just in 2011–2012. They found only 7 percentwere conducted for hostage, barricade, or active shooter situations. The studyfound most were drug searches, with just under 80 percent, or eight out of tenSWAT raids, intended simply to serve a search warrant, meaning they targetedsomeone only suspected of a crime.More than 65 percent of the SWAT deployments studied, almost none with outsideoversight, involved forcible entry, the use of a battering ram, explosivedevices, or simply a boot. “And because these raids often involve forced entryinto homes, often at night, they’re actually creating [emphasis in the original]violence and confrontation where there was none before,” opined Radley Balko,the Washington Post blogger and author of the book Rise of the Warrior Cop: TheMilitarization of America’s Police Forces.Although police routinely cite the presence of weapons to justify an armed andviolent SWAT raid, the ACLU report observed that weapons were found in only 35percent of the cases studied.The ACLU said its report is incomplete, due to the fact that of the 225 lawenforcement agencies asked for public records (out of more than 17,000 totalU.S. agencies), 114 denied access to such records in whole or in part. “Inshort, we have police departments that are increasingly using violent,confrontational tactics to break into private homes for increasingly low-levelcrimes, and they seem to believe that the public has no right to know thespecifics of when, how and why those tactics are being used,” noted Balko.Many SWAT teams are essentially accountable to no one. These independent SWATgroups claim that although they are funded by the taxpayers, they haveincorporated and therefore, as private corporations, they are exempt fromopening their records to the public.For example, in Massachusetts, several SWAT teams operate under law enforcementcouncils, or LECs, funded by police agencies and overseen by an executive board,usually composed of police chiefs from member police departments. Critics pointout that outsourcing SWAT team activities is an effective way for policedepartments to hide their military-style tactics and equipment from citizenscrutiny.After citing a number of baseless drug raids and accidental deaths in the BayState, Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney for the Massachusetts ACLU, said, “Youcan’t have it both ways. The same government authority that allows them to carryweapons, make arrests, and break down the doors of Massachusetts residentsduring dangerous raids also makes them a government agency that is subject tothe open records law.”These secretive SWAT enterprises have already caused a number of tragedies. InMay 2014, a SWAT team in Habersham County, Georgia, in a botched drug raid,crashed through the door of a home and tossed a flash-bang grenade that landedin the crib of nineteen-month-old Bounkham “Bou Bou” Phonesavanh. Police claimedthey had staked out the home for months based on erroneous information from aninformant that someone living there was selling methamphetamine. According tothe child’s mother, “I heard my baby wailing and asked one of the officers tolet me hold him. He screamed at me to sit down and shut up and blocked my view,so I couldn’t see my son. I could see a singed crib. And I could see a pool ofblood. The officers yelled at me to calm down and told me my son was fine, thathe’d just lost a tooth. It was only hours later when they finally let us driveto the hospital that we found out Bou Bou was in the intensive burn unit andthat he’d been placed into a medically induced coma.”Later in the year the family’s attorney reported Phonesavanh has to dateincurred an estimated $800,000 worth of expenses due to his injuries. Shortlyafter its personnel severely burned “Baby Bou Bou” with a flash-bang grenade,the Habersham County Sheriff’s Department vowed to pay for the child’s medicalexpenses. Later the family discovered through medical providers that the countyhad reneged on its promise. County officials stated that it would be “illegal”to pay.Many felt it was bad enough that the incident happened but to cripple the familywith nearly a million dollars in medical expenses was unconscionable and therefusal to take responsibility for a horrible mistake appeared criminallynegligent, at the very least.The raid on the home of Georgetown financial adviser Mark Witaschek one night inmid-2013 involved more than three dozen SWAT team members of the D.C. police whoentered his home with guns drawn. Witaschek’s fourteen-year-old daughter openedthe door. Once inside, the SWAT team began pointing firearms at everyone in thehome, including Witaschek and his girlfriend, Bonnie Harris. Witaschek said,“They used a battering ram to bash down the bathroom door and pull [hissixteen-year-old son] out of the shower, naked . . . The police put all thechildren together in a room, while we were handcuffed upstairs. I could hearthem crying, not knowing what was happening.” He added that the police search ofhis house caused an estimated $10,000 damage.What caused this furor? Witaschek’s estranged wife, in an attempt to obtain arestraining order against her husband, told a court clerk she had beenthreatened with a gun, a charge a judge later found was without merit. However,Washington, D.C., has the most stringent gun laws in the nation, which outlawboth weapons and ammunition if not registered. An avid hunter, Witaschek hadstored his weapons with a sister in Arlington, Virginia. During the raid, policeseized a holster, a brass casing, a box of slugs for use in a black-powder rifle(muzzle-loading muskets are not legally considered weapons), and one shotgunshell, which had misfired years earlier and was kept as a souvenir of a huntingtrip. Although the shell casing and slugs could not be fired through a weapon,under the draconian D.C. laws, they still count as ammunition.During a trial in March 2014, some of the evidence was removed from the recorddue to an insufficient warrant. By reducing the charges, officials were able toskirt a jury trial where they may have risked jury nullification. Witaschekwould eventually be convicted of “attempted possession of unlawful ammunition”even though the judge never ruled on the shotgun shell, and the black-powderballs were for a weapon that is not considered illegal. A number of observersremarked that the prosecution had no clear understanding of either firearms orfirearm terminology. “None of these people know anything about gun issues,including the judge,” Witaschek charged. He was ordered to register as aconvicted gun offender, which prompted him to tell the media, “I was foundguilty of something that is not even illegal and forced to register forsomething that is not illegal. [Now] I run the risk of losing my job, myoccupation, as a result of this conviction.”Some saw Witaschek’s ordeal as an illustration of the misuse of SWAT raids andhis conviction as a clear example of the end result of gun registration andpolice militarization. Many feel that when the feds desire to punish someone,they can always trump up any number of charges and have them arrested. Today,because of the militarization of law enforcement, they can also stage armed,SWAT-style raids of homes, businesses, and farms. “When the USDA has automaticweapons, night sights, and thirty-round magazines as part of a department of‘agriculture,’ something has gone terribly wrong in America,” observesNaturalNews editor Mike Adams.In August 2014, tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, already were high after days ofdemonstrations following the fatal shooting of eighteen-year-old Michael Brownon August 9. There was nationwide dismay over what many perceived asoverreaction by local police, who descended on demonstrators with flak jackets,military equipment, and automatic weapons. The ensuing violence resulted inMissouri State Police taking control of the situation.Only one Missouri police officer, who was not named at the time, was removedfrom duty during the Ferguson violence. This action came after the officer wasvideotaped pointing a weapon at bystanders at the demonstrations in Ferguson andtelling a journalist, “I’m going to fucking kill you!” His removal was theresult of an irate letter from the ACLU to Missouri Highway Patrolsuperintendent Corporal Ron Repogle stating, “This officer’s conduct—frompointing a weapon, to threatening to kill, to responding with profanity to arequest for identity—was from start to finish wholly unacceptable. Such behaviorserves to heighten, not reduce, tension.”Many would be shocked to learn that the often brutal and aggressive policetactics found in the news items of today may have originated in Israel, a nationsurrounded by militant neighbors, which has long taken an aggressive stancetoward its enemies. Israeli authorities have practiced constant crackdowns onPalestinian protesters and zero tolerance for terrorists.According to Gordon Duff, senior editor of Veterans Today, the overreach oflocal police began during the George W. Bush administration, when MichaelChertoff, who holds dual Israeli-American citizenship, became director ofHomeland Security. Duff believes Chertoff mandated that American police forcesbe trained by Israeli groups in crowd control, counterterrorism, andintelligence gathering. As Duff notes, “Since that time, shootings of unarmedcivilians have gone up 500 percent, attacks on legal political protests bypolice have become a scandal and huge stockpiles of ammunition and militaryheavy weaponry have been distributed to law enforcement groups in every regionof America, both local and federally controlled.Duff realized the extent of the problem with police killings when he entered thephrase “police shoot unarmed man” into Google, and got 1,610,000 responses. Hesaid he found in almost every case that the officers had been trained in theIsraeli martial art of Krav Maga, a fighting technique for use in violentencounters and combat situations that was originally developed by Israelimilitary personnel. Krav Maga has been encouraged by Homeland Security to dealwith America’s “fringe elements,” including the poor, homeless people, mentalpatients, and veterans. The website of Krav Fit, a chain of schools that teachKrav Maga, claims that hundreds of U.S. law enforcement agencies have adoptedthis fighting skill.During the 2014 violence in Ferguson that resulted after the fatal shooting ofMichael Brown, many commentators compared the police response to Israeliaggressiveness toward Palestinian demonstrators. Not surprisingly, many policeofficials in the area, including St. Louis County police chief Timothy Fitch,received anti-terrorism training in Israel.In October 2011, an exercise at the University of California at Berkeley sawjoint training between American police forces and the Yamam, described byaward-winning journalist Max Blumenthal as “an Israeli Border Police unit thatclaims to specialize in ‘counter-terror’ operations but is better known for itsextra-judicial assassinations of Palestinian militant leaders and long record ofrepressions and abuses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.”A month after these exercises, code-named “Urban Shield,” the Alameda CountySheriff’s Department was involved in a confrontation with the “Occupy” movementin downtown Oakland in which demonstrators were attacked with tear gas andrubber bullets, which left an Iraq War veteran in critical condition and dozensinjured.Blumenthal wrote in the Internet edition of the Arab newspaper Al Akhbar thatsince 9/11 there has been an “Israelification” of U.S. police forces, acircumstance not mentioned in the major media. “Having been schooled in Israelitactics perfected during a sixty-three-year experience of controlling,dispossessing, and occupying an indigenous population, local police forces haveadapted them to monitor Muslim and immigrant neighborhoods in U.S. cities,” henoted. “Meanwhile, former Israeli military officers have been hired to spearheadsecurity operations at American airports and suburban shopping malls, leading toa wave of disturbing incidents of racial profiling, intimidation, and FBIinterrogations of innocent, unsuspecting people. The New York PoliceDepartment’s disclosure that it deployed ‘counter-terror’ measures againstOccupy protesters encamped in downtown Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park is just thelatest example of the so-called War on Terror creeping into everyday life.Revelations like these have raised serious questions about the extent to whichIsraeli-inspired tactics are being used.”Blumenthal said this intertwining of Israeli and American police forces has beendocumented through occasional news reports, but these reports typicallyhighlight Israel’s national security prowess without examining the problematicnature of working with a country accused of grave human rights abuses.One example is the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange (GILEE), apolice exchange program in which high-ranking Georgia police officers travel toIsrael to learn counterterrorism tactics from the national police.“Conversely, Israeli police officials travel to Atlanta every two years to learnGeorgia’s drug enforcement tactics,” reported the San Francisco Bay View in2011. “Through GILEE, the Israeli police adopt these tactics and employ them onPalestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians residing in the occupied WestBank. While GILEE has relationships with several international police agencies,its relationship with the Israeli police is the most intimate and mosttroubling. Israel is one of the most brazen violators of human rights andinternational law in the world.”At a time when American police are being criticized for overzealousness andaggressiveness, it is troubling for many to learn that they are receivingtraining from a nation that is being investigated by the International CriminalCourt (ICC) for war crimes against Palestinians.Adding to mounting concerns over the Israeli indoctrination of U.S. police werethe 2014 statements of a former Israeli soldier. Eran Efrati, atwenty-eight-year-old sergeant in Israel’s Nachal Division, served in the WestBank and was discharged in 2009. He then joined Breaking the Silence, anorganization of Israeli veterans hoping to raise awareness of questionableactivities in the West Bank.Addressing the American public, Efrati warned, “If you don’t care aboutPalestinians . . . you guys should know: you are next in line. The next one whowill die from a tear gas canister into his chest will be in Zuccotti Park, willbe in Denver, will be in Oakland, in San Francisco. It is happening herealready. It is happening to different people, to people of color, to immigrantsin this country, it is already happening. You guys are next in line. The nextone who will die out of brutality of the police will be one of your sons or yourdaughters—in a protest. Because they [U.S. police and Israeli soldiers] aretraining together. Your police—training with our army. Our army is training themhow to take care of the enemy . . . But when they come back, you are theirenemy.”Many observers fear not only that this sort of official training may benegatively affecting the behavior of this nation’s officers, but that certainaspects of American culture may also be to blame. Vicious films and video gamesmay be partly responsible for hardening the minds of young people towardviolence. Young men and women who play first-person shooter games and watchfilms filled with car chases, beatings, and shootings soon assume this isnatural. These same conditioned youths grow up to be both police officers andgang members to whom violence is an accepted part of life.Overly aggressive cops make for problematic situations, because even when copsare in the wrong, it is often difficult to discipline them. For example, in late2013, Lafayette, Indiana, lieutenant Tom Davidson was videotaped knocking overthe wheelchair of twenty-five-year-old Nicholas Kincade during an encounter withpolice. Lafayette police chief Patrick J. Flannelly, following an internal staffinvestigation, said Davidson’s use of force was “outside our training andpolicy” and recommended Davidson be fired. But a civil service commission boardvoted three to two to merely have Davidson demoted and placed on probationfollowing a thirty-day unpaid suspension."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-37]DEADLY FORCE [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-37]AN ADDED DIMENSION TO SUCH PROBLEMS IS THE INCREASING USE of private policeforces. In 2012, Sharpstown, a community of 66,000 located southwest of Houston,joined more than seventy Texas communities in contracting with the private firmStrategic Executive And Logistical Security Solutions LLC (SEAL) to provideroutine police protection.Private police, termed by some as mercenaries for corporate America, areentrusted with all the powers of a government cop but not held to the same legalstandards, according to Rutherford Institute President John W. Whitehead,adding, “[T]hese private police firms enjoy the trappings of governmentagencies—the weaponry, the arrest and shoot authority, even the ability toticket and frisk— [but] they’re often poorly trained, inadequately screened,poorly regulated and heavily armed. Now if that sounds a lot like public policeofficers, you wouldn’t be far wrong.”Whitehead said the label of “private” is dubious at best. “Mind you, this is afar cry from a privatization of police. These are guns for hire, answerable tocorporations who are already in bed with the government. They are extensions ofthe government without even the pretense of public accountability,” he stated.Of course, police misconduct is most worrisome when it involves lethal force.The militarization of police has been accompanied by a new “us-versus-them”attitude toward the public. Police have not only become heavily armed but alsoquicker on the trigger. This is an issue that transcends issues of race.And it’s nothing new. According to USA Today, local police reported at leastfour hundred police killings to the FBI each year in the seven years ending in2012. But despite the perception that a disproportionate number of blacks arebeing killed by white police, fatal police shootings appear to be an issuetranscending racial divisions. Only ninety-six of the reported four hundreddeaths were black citizens shot by white police. However, such reports didreveal that 18 percent of blacks killed during those years were under agetwenty-one, compared to 8.7 percent of whites.Nevertheless, USA Today reporters Kevin Johnson, Meghan Hoyer, and Brad Heathnoted the database used for these statistics is considered flawed and largelyincomplete. “The killings are self-reported by law enforcement and not allpolice departments participate, so the database undercounts the actual number ofdeaths. Plus, the numbers are not audited after they are submitted to the FBIand the statistics on ‘justifiable’ homicides have conflicted with independentmeasures of fatalities at the hands of police,” they reported.News reports collected over the past few years have indicated a marked increasein police misconduct and overreaction. But finding comprehensive data on policekillings apparently is often difficult, if not impossible.D. Brian Burghart, editor of the Reno News & Review spent two years attemptingto assemble a national database of deadly police violence, but had littlesuccess. “Nowhere could I find out how many people died during interactions withpolice in the United States,” wrote Burghart. “Try as I might, I just couldn’twrap my head around that idea. How was it that, in the twenty-first century,this data wasn’t being tracked, compiled, and made available to the public? Howcould journalists know if police were killing too many people in their town ifthey didn’t have a way to compare to other cities? Hell, how could citizens orpolice? How could cops possibly know ‘best practices’ for dealing with any fluidsituation? They couldn’t.”Burghart did accumulate some statistics, which show that in 2012, police killednine people in Shelby County, Tennessee, and in 2013, killed eleven. “Who thehell knew Memphis police were killing men at more than double the rate the copswere killing people in Albuquerque?” he pondered. “The biggest thing I’ve takenaway from this project is something I’ll never be able to prove, but I’mconvinced to my core: The lack of such a database is intentional,” saidBurghart. “No government—not the federal government, and not the thousands ofmunicipalities that give their police forces license to use deadly force—wantsyou to know how many people it kills and why. It’s the only conclusion that canbe drawn from the evidence. What evidence? In attempting to collect thisinformation, I was lied to and delayed by the FBI, even when I was only tryingto find out the addresses of police departments to make public records requests.The government collects millions of bits of data annually about law enforcementin its Uniform Crime Report, but it doesn’t collect information about the mostconsequential act a law enforcer can do.”Burghart’s allegation is supported by Geoff Alpert, a criminologist at theUniversity of South Carolina, who also points out that only about 750 of the17,000 police agencies in the U.S. have contributed to the FBI’s database.“There is no national database for this type of information, and that is socrazy. We’ve been trying for years, but nobody wanted to fund it and the[police] departments didn’t want it. They were concerned with their image andliability. They don’t want to bother with it,” said Alpert.The “bother” explanation rings hollow since all police department are bothereddaily with trivial lawbreaking, such as jaywalking, slight speeding, and expiredinspection stickers. It is more likely that departments, perhaps at the urgingof federal authorities, do not want police violence publicized out of aversionto a public demand for stronger local control, not to mention the fear ofliability issues.The corporate mass media, accustomed to praising and supporting any policeaction, have largely overlooked the increasing use of deadly force by police.Next only to westerns, TV cop shows depicting brave and effective policeofficers have long been a stable of evening entertainment. The acceptance ofpolice officers acting outside the law in order to bring justice to the badguys, on TV and in movies, has not been lost on either the public or the cops.But today there is a growing discontent with the number of deaths caused bynewly militarized police agencies.Some examples of unrestrained lethal force include the June 27, 2013, shootingof eighty-year-old Eugene Mallory, killed in his bed when Los Angeles Countydeputies used a no-knock warrant looking for methamphetamines. None were found.In 2010, Douglas Zerby was finishing up watering his lawn, holding a hosenozzle, when neighbors, probably conditioned by the violence on TV, calledpolice and reported him holding a gun. Long Beach police arrived and withoutwarning fatally shot Zerby twelve times in the chest, arms, and legs. Zerby’sfamily won a $6.5 million federal suit against the Long Beach Police Department,but his mother told the media, “The money does not bring my son back, which isall I really want.”In May 2014, the Purcellville, Virginia, police were called whenseventeen-year-old Christian Alberto Sierra became depressed and unruly and cuthimself with a knife. As he ran from his home, a policeman arrived and orderedhim to stop. Then shots were fired and Sierra was fatally wounded. State policesaid the boy was shot after lunging at the officer, who was placed onadministrative leave. The boy’s distraught mother wondered why the policemanused such force on a teen they knew was in emotional distress, not committing acrime. “Why would you shoot a child that is suicidal? You are there to save him,not finish him off,” she wondered.Like Sierra’s mother, many citizens are becoming alarmed over suchindiscriminate shootings by increasingly militarized and combat-minded police.One of the most egregious and publicized instances was the shooting of MiriamCarey, the Connecticut mother who was shot while making a U-turn in front of theWhite House on October 3, 2013.The corporate mass media initially styled the incident as a terrorist threat,then backpedaled, reporting that Carey was probably on drugs or suffering frommental problems. Well into 2014, at least one search engine still categorizedCarey as “the 34 year old Connecticut woman who was shot to death by lawenforcement officers on October 3rd, 2013, after ramming a White Housecheckpoint gate and striking 2 police officers, with a 1 year old childpassenger.” After none of this allegations proved true, the story was quicklydropped.Carey family attorney Eric Sanders was finally able to obtain the woman’sautopsy report some six months later. It revealed no drugs of any kind in thebody of the victim. Apparently, her erratic driving behavior was caused by beingshot in the back of the head by White House guards after making an abrupt U-turnwhen she realized she had mistakenly turned into the White House main gate. Theguards shot at her as she was leaving, with no evidence that she was a threat.She was then shot again in her car with her child secured in the backseat. Therewas no word on any disciplinary action against the officers involved and no onein Congress appeared interested in investigating or holding any one responsiblefor Carey’s death.One video that went viral over the Internet was the 2013 execution-styleshooting of thirty-seven-year-old Daniel Saenz while in custody. The El Pasobodybuilder was struggling with Officer Jose Flores in the El Paso County Jailwhile being transferred for medical treatment, when the Flores pulled hisservice pistol and fired one shot into Saenz. A spokesman for a Texas lawenforcement organization said a nearby guard hit Flores’s hand, causing him toshoot Saenz, whose hands were handcuffed behind him at the time. Despite asecurity video of the entire affair, a grand jury decided not to bring anycharges against Flores, who was placed on leave.In an opinion piece for Vice.com, Natasha Lennard voiced dismay that the Saenzshooting prompted no outrage on the part of the public. “It is merely my humbleopinion that seeing a cop shoot an unarmed man dead should produce a collectiverage so strong that the police can feel it, see it, and smell it,” wroteLennard. Such rage was exhibited in Ferguson a year later and was met with amilitarized police response resulting in violence on both sides.Columnist William Norman Grigg noted, “Every day, somewhere in this supposedlyfree country, some version of this script is played out: A police officer spiesan individual committing a harmless but ‘illegal’ act, aggressively pursues thesubject, inflicts physical violence on the victim, then escalates that violenceto lethal or nearly lethal levels when the victim doesn’t immediately submit tothe state-licensed aggression.”Even conservatives have expressed concern over the number of deaths at the handsof police. Economist Paul Craig Roberts, a former assistant secretary of thetreasury for economic policy under President Reagan and a former associateeditor of the Wall Street Journal, commented in the wake of the 2014 policekilling in Ferguson, “The gratuitous violence employed by police is no morejustified than the gratuitous violence employed by the Israeli military towardPalestinians. ‘Law and order conservatives’ confuse police accountability withthe coddling of criminals and terrorists. They are unable to comprehend thatunaccountable police are a greater threat to them than are criminals withoutbadges.”There is usually no public anger over misconduct by increasingly aggressivepolice. But such anger did assert itself in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city of555,000 that witnessed twenty-six deaths by police in just four years. As inother places, the deaths were followed by some controversy and a debate over howmuch force is necessary for a police department to do its job. But events inAlbuquerque took a dramatic turn in May 2014, following the murder of JamesBoyd, a mentally ill homeless man who was fatally shot after forty officersdescended on him as he attempted to camp out in the Sandia foothills.Albuquerque citizens, irate over the number of police shootings, stormed a citycouncil meeting and even tried to make a citizens’ arrest on the police chief.The meeting was canceled with all but two council members fleeing the room.The council canceled another meeting and set prohibitions on signs and protests,but demonstrators continued to voice their discontent. “When are they going toquit killing people and start taking them into custody?” asked Ken Ellis, thereto protest the killing of his son, a twenty-five-year-old Iraq War veteransuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who was gunned down in 2010. “Theyhave to address this issue. They can’t sweep it under the rug anymore.”In January 2015, Bernalillo County district attorney Kari Brandenburg,responding to the public outcry over police killings, announced she would lodgemurder charges against two of the Albuquerque police officers involved in Boyd’sdeath. Brandenburg said unlike recent high-profile cases in Ferguson and NewYork City, a public trial would allow the public to hear all the witnesses andview the evidence.In April 2014, the U.S. Justice Department issued a forty-six-page reportdetailing a pattern of excessive force on the part of Albuquerque police,including a policy of shooting at moving vehicles to disable them, a policyallowing officers to use personal weapons instead of standard-issue firearms.According to this report, “Officers see the guns as status symbols. APDpersonnel we interviewed indicated that this fondness for powerful weaponsillustrates the aggressive culture.”In response to the report and in an apparent effort to stop leaks, Albuquerquepolice chief Gorden Eden sent a text message to all department employeesinstructing them to stop meeting with DOJ investigators. A spokesperson for thepolice explained the chief’s text message was to ensure that all communicationsto the DOJ came from official negotiations, including those of the chief.In the wake of the DOJ report, the APD banned the use of personal guns and thepractice of shooting to disable moving cars along with other reforms, policychanges that should be emulated by other departments.In May, irate citizens in Hearne, Texas, marched on police headquartersfollowing the death of ninety-three-year-old Pearlie Golden. Upset over beingdenied a driver’s license, she reportedly brandished a gun when police arrivedat her home.The citizen demonstration prompted the city council in Hearne to voteunanimously for the firing of Police Officer Stephen Stem over the fatalshooting. About a year previously, Stem had been placed on leave after fatallyshooting a suspect during the investigation of an unruly crowd in an apartmentparking lot.Public anger over police killings also arose in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Themilitarization of police forces has only added fuel to the fire of anger andsuspicion over what many see as police heavy-handedness.Sometimes fatal police action does not even require the use of bullets. Inmid-2014, an Illinois lawsuit was filed in federal court against six policeofficers accused of killing a ninety-five-year-old World War II vet with beanbagbullets.John Wrana Jr. had resisted leaving his assisted living center to go to ahospital for treatment of a suspected urinary tract infection. Police werecalled when Wrana refused to leave his room. According to the complaint filed byWrana’s stepdaughter, police decided to take the man by force. One officer firedfive rounds of beanbag bullets from a twelve-gauge shotgun from a distance ofabout six to eight feet. A medical examiner ruled that the man’s death was dueto blunt-force trauma to his abdomen as a result of the shots.The lawsuit stated that documents from the beanbag manufacturer noted that thebeanbags can travel at approximately 190 miles per hour and that “shots to thehead, neck, thorax, heart or spine can result in fatal injury.” Rob Kall,publisher of OpEd News, said, “When a brutal fascist authoritarian law is putout there, by legislation or executive decree, the ripples it produces can bemassive. The president may order the killing of two or three Americans andhundreds or thousands of others. He may authorize agencies to secretly detain aperson or a few people indefinitely. But then the slippery slope leads to peoplebeing detained without the president even knowing—for reasons of ‘plausibledeniability.’ When the president can do it, every petty, two-bit judge, sheriff,town cop, magistrate and courthouse clerk starts thinking it’s okay to push thelimits.”Even honest citizens, many with police or military backgrounds, find themselveson the receiving end of increasingly authoritarian government tactics. CaptainNicolas Aquino, while attending the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey,California, was confronted outside his home by Sheriff’s Deputy Ivan Rodriguez.Apparently, the deputy had been summoned by a neighbor of Aquino’s who called toreport a suspected burglar. Even after explaining he lived there and showing hismilitary ID and offering his utility bill, Aquino was placed in a choke hold andhandcuffed.After studying Aquino’s wallet, the deputy realized that the captain was indeedthe legal resident. But Aquino related, “The officer did not apologize. He pullsme over to the side of the driveway and he does basic victim blaming, and hesays it was my fault for not knowing my neighbors. He then states that he hadwanted to Tase me if he had a Taser, and he would have shot and killed me if hehad drawn his weapon, and he would have been fully justified in killing me.”In May 2014, a Tulsa policeman was accused of firing his gun at a car containingtwo teenagers who were making out late at night in an empty school parking lot.When the officer approached their parked car, the teens tried to drive off butwere stopped when the officer shot out their tires. The officer claimed he feltthreatened by their attempt to leave and fired his weapon. It was not explainedhow firing a gun in a neighborhood was somehow less threatening than scaredteens trying to drive off to avoid getting in trouble.It is apparent from the abundance of such stories that police departments shouldrequire more extensive training—not in weapons and tactics but in how to dealfairly with the public and to be more aware of the need for good publicrelations. They should be reminded that they work for the citizens. They are noton the streets to act as parents or prison guards.But most importantly, officers must avoid the shoot-first-ask-questions-latermentality and understand that lethal force must be the last resort in anyconflict."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-39]WRONGFUL ARRESTS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-39]ONE ALL-TOO-COMMON RESPONSE TO BOTH UNWARRANTED SURVEILLANCE and the growingpolice state goes as follows: “If you are not doing anything wrong, you havenothing to worry about.”In today’s world, with its ever-expanding list of laws and regulations, coupledwith the fear generated by the federal government and corporate media in theaftermath of 9/11, it is possible for a person to get in serious trouble evenwhen doing nothing wrong. Consider these real cases from recent years.Niakea Williams’s son has Asperger’s, and she was called to his elementaryschool because he had had a behavioral episode. In her haste she failed toproperly sign in to the school, and despite the fact that the staff knew her,the whole school was placed on lockdown and Mrs. Williams was arrested andescorted out in handcuffs.Or consider the case of Greg Snider, of Houston, Texas, who was pulled over on afreeway and surrounded by ten cop cars after a drug sting gone wrong. Snider hadstopped in a downtown parking lot to make a business call, when he wasapproached by a homeless man who asked for spare change. Snider gave the manseventy-five cents and drove off. Moments later, his car was stopped, and thepolice were shouting, “We saw you downtown. We saw what you did.” “I was like,‘Are you kidding me? I gave a homeless man seventy-five cents,’” said Snider,who was held for a half hour before police realized they had mistaken his act ofcharity for a drug deal.In 2012, Paul Valin was about fifteen miles from his Des Moines home when hefound a backpack that contained what he believed may have been meth-makingequipment. He reported his find to the authorities and, as a consequence, hishome was listed on the DEA’s National Clandestine Laboratory Register as a methlab. The Justice Department’s website admits that the “Department does notaccept responsibility or liability for damages of any kind resulting fromreliance on an entry.”Also in 2012, New York police staged a midnight raid on the Bronx home of GeraldBryan, punching through walls and tearing out light fixtures looking for drugs,even though they had no warrant to do so. Bryan was arrested and $4,800 in cashwas seized. One year later, the case against him was dropped. But when he triedto get his money back, he found that under asset forfeiture laws it had beendeposited into the pension fund of the NYPD.Bryan’s case is merely one example of civil forfeiture, the act by which amunicipality can seize money during an arrest. Civil forfeiture, which hasbecome increasingly common as cash-strapped cities look for additional revenuestreams, has been upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, whichruled that a person can lose their property even if someone else used theproperty to commit drug crimes without one’s knowledge. A former head of theforfeiture unit for the Bronx DA’s office admitted that in about 85 percent ofcivil forfeiture cases, the property owner is never charged with a crime.By early 2015, the forfeiture practice had drawn such public criticism that U.S.attorney general Eric Holder announced he was restricting the federalgovernment’s role in a civil asset protection program in which federal agenciescould take possession of assets seized by local law enforcement with theexception of firearms or other materials related to public safety. Previously,such assets could be handed over to the feds, who would share proceeds with thelocal entities. Holder said since all states now have their own asset forfeiturelaws, it is no longer necessary for the Justice Department to hold seizedassets.Random drug testing is another way in which police use public fear of illegaldrugs to terrorize law-abiding citizens. In 2013, Jameson Hospital and LawrenceCounty Children and Youth Services agreed to pay $143,500 to settle a lawsuitfiled by Elizabeth Mort, whose infant daughter was taken away for five daysbecause of a false-positive drug test apparently caused by consumption of apoppy seed bagel. In 2014, Rachael Devore sued another hospital, Magee-Womens atthe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, saying a false-positive drug testapparently caused by poppy seeds in farmers-market bread resulted in anAllegheny County Children Youth and Families investigation of her family.According to a story by Radley Balko in the Washington Post, “No one would arguethat a new mother with a drug habit presents all sorts of problems for bothmother and child. But even if these tests were 100 percent accurate, treatingboth patients for addiction seems like a far more humane policy than yanking anewborn from his mother’s arms—or sending the mother to prison.”Jordan Wiser, a Jefferson, Ohio, high school student, was another casualty ofpolice hysteria fueled by warrantless intrusions into private citizens’ lives.Wiser was held in jail for thirteen days and finally allowed to post a $50,000bond after officials of the technical school he was attending used the studenthandbook as a warrant to search his vehicle, where they found two airsoft gunsand a folding-blade pocketknife.Another high school student, in Clarksville, Tennessee, David Duren-Sanner, whohad never been in trouble and was carrying a three-point grade average, wassuspended for ten days and sent to an alternative school after police found afishing knife in the car he was driving during a lockdown. The senior studenthad given authorities permission to search his car believing he had “nothing tohide.” The car belonged to his father, a commercial fisherman. Duren-Sanner’sgrandmother, Peggy Duren, said she tried explaining that the knife didn’t belongto her grandson, but school officials wouldn’t listen. “Unfortunately [the viceprincipal] said that’s the way it is now: Guilty until proven innocent. It’spart of this zero tolerance policy,” she said, adding that should the boy’spunishment be upheld, Duren-Sanner will not be able to attend prom, his JROTCball, or walk at graduation.Seventy-year-old Washington State resident Darien Rossen filed a lawsuit againstthe Idaho State Police after Trooper Justin Klitch stopped Rossen’s car,searched it, and accused Rossen of using marijuana. It seems Rossen’s carcarried license plates from Colorado, a state that has legalized pot. Klitchclaimed Rossen’s eyes “appeared glassy,” but no drugs were found. These are notisolated incidents. They are part of an ominous pattern of inflexible lawscombined with police overreaction. And there are many other examples of peoplebeing punished for doing nothing wrong.Sometimes the alleged crime they’ve committed isn’t even on the books in theUnited States. One unlucky man found out you can go to jail for violating anobscure law of another country. Abner “Abbie” Schoenwetter had imported fishfrom Honduras for twelve years, packaging them in plastic bags, all inspected byboth U.S. Customs and the FDA. But then the National Marine Fishery Servicedecided that Schoenwetter had violated a Honduran law requiring cardboardpackaging rather than plastic. Despite the fact that he had no criminal recordand that the attorney general of Honduras stated that the cardboard regulationwas not applicable in his case, Schoenwetter was convicted of violating anothercountry’s law and sentenced to six years in prison.This case was not a fluke, according to Brian W. Walsh, senior legal researchfellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. Walshnotes aspiring inventor Krister Evertson spent almost two years in federalprison because federal prosecutors and EPA officials, aided by questionablefederal laws, decided that storing materials in three-eighths-inch-thickstainless-steel drums was the equivalent of disposing of them without a permit.Three-time Indianapolis 500 racecar champion Bobby Unser was arrested andconvicted of driving a snowmobile on a federally protected wildlife area eventhough Unser and a companion said they had mistakenly entered the area lost in ablinding blizzard for two days and almost died.In November 2013, Jason Dewing was ticketed by an upstate New York officer fordriving while talking on his cell phone. When his case came to trial in March2014, he was able to demonstrate, using his phone records, that he had not, infact, been talking on the phone, but was instead using an electronic cigarette.So the judge then charged and convicted Dewing of violating New York traffic law1225-d, driving while using a portable electronic device, even though ane-cigarette cannot make a call or send text or data.Jeff Sherwood of the Knoxville Business Examiner commented: “It is a sad day inAmerica when one driver can pass an officer smoking a tobacco cigarette and notwarrant a second glance, but when another driver passes an officer ‘vaping’ anelectronic cigarette, he finds himself in front of a judge trying to explain thelaw.”So what are we to do? Former defense attorney James Duane, now a professor atRegent Law School, advises people that it is never a good idea to talk topolice. He explained that even the Congressional Research Service cannot countthe total number of federal crimes on the books as they are scattered throughoutmore than fifty titles of U.S. Code filling some twenty-seven thousand pages. Henoted that the American Bar Association (ABA) estimates that additionaladministrative regulations issued by Congress total nearly ten thousand.Duane’s advice was supported by Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer,who has stated, “The complexity of modern federal criminal law, codified inseveral thousand sections of the United States Code and the virtually infinitevariety of factual circumstances that might trigger an investigation into apossible violation of the law, make it difficult for anyone to know, in advance,just when a particular set of statements might later appear (to a prosecutor) tobe relevant to some such investigation.”And these are only federal laws.Entire books have been written about squirrelly laws still on the books in manystates. For instance, you can’t play dominoes on Sunday in Alabama, nor can youview a moose from an airplane in Alaska. It’s a violation for women to wearpants in Tucson, and it’s illegal to eat an orange while sitting in a bathtub inthe state of California. And there’s plenty more where these came from.Often these bizarre laws are not enforced, but sometimes they are, to disastrouseffect. In September 2014, the West Virginia Natural Resources Police madeeleven arrests and seized 190 pounds of ginseng, a plant highly valued in Asiaas a medicine. Police said the ginseng haul was worth an estimated $180,000.That same month, twenty-five persons were arrested for illegally harvestingginseng in southern Indiana. Who knew harvesting ginseng was illegal?It turns out that growing and using ginseng on one’s own property is legal, butharvesting the plant out of season or on public land and all national parks isan offense.And, of course, there are always the old selectively enforced standbys that canget you arrested. Loitering, failing to show proper identification, and,certainly not least, trying to argue with an officer or, worse yet, trying topull away from their grip, which means you are evading police or assaulting theofficer, which can send you to jail quickly, if not get you beaten or shot.In the police state that is expanding within the American death culture, onedoes not even have to be home to receive a warrantless search by authorities. Alittle-known police tactic is the increasing use of “sneak and peek” warrantsthat allow police to covertly enter private homes, perform searches, seizeproperty, and then leave quietly without notifying the homeowner.Sneak-and-peek warrants, an extension of “no-knock” raids, are obtained byhaving a judge authorize the police to secretly break into private propertywithout first announcing themselves or presenting the subject of the search witha signed warrant. The search is usually conducted when the suspect is not athome and, in many cases, accomplished surreptitiously, even to disguising thebreak-in to look like a burglary.“The entire premise [of sneak and peek] encourages government agents to adoptthe tactics of criminals in order to gain access to property: breaking andentering, sneaking around, stealing, and risking a surprise confrontation withan unsuspecting civilian,” concluded analysts at the PolicestateUSA website.One tactic offered to protect families from both would-be robbers and no-knockpolice would be to simply build a three-foot “waiting area” extension to thefront door so that whoever might break down the first door, alerting theresidents, would only face a second one.One shocking way to give overzealous police second thoughts about no-knock raidsand the sanctity of a person’s home was illustrated in early 2014 when a Texasgrand jury declined to impose a capital murder indictment against a man forkilling a sheriff’s deputy who entered his home in a no-knock raid searching forsome pot plants. This decision was tantamount to jury nullification (when a jurydecides on the justness of a law as well as the letter of the law) and reflectedthe public attitude in Texas that a man’s home is his castle and should remaininviolate except in the most extreme cases.Twenty-year-old Goedrich Magee, who shot and killed Burleson County sergeantAdam Sowders during a late 2013 raid, said when officers broke into his ruralhome, he thought he was being robbed and acted to protect his pregnantgirlfriend and children. Magee was charged with possession of marijuana afterdeputies recovered a handful of plants and seedlings.“Once again, there has been little attention to the increasing no-knock warrantsthat have grown in tandem with the militarization of our police forces,” wroteconstitutional law scholar Jonathan Turley. “The result is not just a chillingeffect for citizens but increasing mistaken shootings. In this case, an officeris dead and the prosecutors wanted to send away a father for life—for a raid tosecure a few marijuana plants.”Yet despite numerous false arrests and deadly encounters between police andcitizens, there has been little outcry over the state of policing in the USA.Rutherford Institute founder John W. Whitehead remarks, “What is most strikingabout the American police state is not the mega-corporations running amok in thehalls of Congress, the militarized police crashing through doors and shootingunarmed citizens, or the invasive surveillance regime which has come to dominateevery aspect of our lives.“No, what has been most disconcerting about the emergence of the American policestate is the extent to which the citizenry appears content to passively wait forsomeone else to solve our nation’s many problems. Unless Americans are preparedto engage in militant nonviolent resistance in the spirit of Martin Luther KingJr. and Gandhi, true reform, if any, will be a long time coming.”After recounting the growth of government spying, militarized police forces, theshooting of unarmed civilians, the erosion of personal property rights, the lossof personal integrity through strip searches, drone surveillance, and thecriminalization of children’s behavior, Whitehead concludes, “To put it bluntly,we are living in an electronic concentration camp. Through a series ofimperceptible steps, we have willingly allowed ourselves to become enmeshed in asystem that knows the most intimate details of our lives, analyzes them, andtreats us accordingly.”Following incidents of police deaths in New York and Missouri, the U.S. JusticeDepartment announced it was widening its involvement with local police in anattempt to curb the growing abuse of police power.“The arrogance and heavy-handed tactics of . . . rogue police officers islargely attributed to the influence of the U.S. government’s Department ofHomeland Security. Now this same U.S. government is going to ‘widen’ itsinvolvement with local police agencies in order to curb police violence? Getreal! You know what’s happening: the U.S. Justice Department is widening itsinvolvement in local police agencies in order to further its parochial politicalagendas and to further promote political correctness,” warned Chuck Baldwin.The growing power of the DHS, which now has jurisdiction over all the U.S.police forces, coupled with overreaching enforcement of innumerable laws andregulations, worry those who view this behemoth as a homegrown Gestapo, thesecret police of Nazi Germany. The head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Himmler,controlled all of Germany’s police forces.A Baptist preacher, Baldwin said what is needed are constitutional sheriffs whowill serve as “the people’s vanguard against both the overreach of the federalgovernment (which spawns so much police abuse, both local and federal) andagainst rogue officers among the police agencies of his jurisdiction.” He alsorecommended partisan-free prosecutors in the local court systems, because manyprosecutors seem motivated by partisan politics rather than “liberty and justicefor all.” “And we also need jurors who are truly blind to their prejudices andpropensities and are willing to acquit or convict on the basis of proven factalone. When a policeman steps over the line, he or she must be held asaccountable as any ordinary citizen,” he added. This would seem especially truein cases involving private police forces.It’s clear there needs to be a buffer between the citizenry and police. Somehave suggested a civilian review board (CRB) might alleviate the situation.A CRB is composed of community residents with no connection to the police whomeet to review public complaints about police misconduct and offerrecommendations for improvements to police chiefs and lawmakers. CRBs may be aneffective way to assuage fear and suspicion in a community. Members should bedrawn from a broad cross section of the population, with an effort to balancerace, religion, and education. But care must be taken to avoid authoritiespacking a CRB with police cronies and sycophants. Unfortunately, past experiencewith review boards has shown that they are easily co-opted by politicalauthorities and end up supporting internal police investigations.For many years, most police agencies have opposed the notion of civilianoversight, but many thoughtful officers today are warming to the idea. RandyRider, writing in the police publication Officer.com, notes that CRBs have beenused successfully in Georgia, particularly in the supervision of childfatalities, child abuse, and domestic violence.“Initially there was great resistance to these boards. However, they are nowaccepted institutions and have created a sense of security ensuring that thesecases are investigated thoroughly. In some cases their oversight has led to newprocedures, laws, and revealed evidence not discovered prior to the review,”argued Rider. Some activists and even some review boards have been surprised tofind that local-department-internal-affairs investigations have often imposedharsher punishments than those sought by a CRB.“Any police department in this country ought to be proud to have inspected anyinternal matter that they have investigated. It would display good will andinstill a sense of confidence to the public,” argued Rider. “After all, who arewe here to protect? Are we above being held accountable? We are held to a higherstandard than the average citizen. We have to be. We are in the public eye. Howcan we go to court and take another person’s freedom if we are not?”CHANGING THE GAMECITIZENS MUST ASSUME GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN actions, learn to workwith one another for justice and true equality, and send a stern message thatthey will not tolerate a police state.It is now obvious that U.S. police departments must begin an effort towarddemilitarization. If the nation is to avoid a total police state, lawenforcement should return to proven and kinder methods of crime prevention andcontrol, especially as statistics show that crime is decreasing across thecountry. Walking patrols in some inner-city neighborhoods may bring police intocloser contact with the citizens even if this means less traffic fines. Andindividuals must take it upon themselves to monitor the actions of police. Thiscan vary from judicious use of their cell-phone camera to lodging complaintswhen the situation warrants it.But primarily, public policy must focus on the basic causes of community unrestand crime: lack of jobs, educational opportunities, and hope. The poor should beencouraged to feed themselves nutritious food from small gardens rather than befined and discouraged by overbearing local ordinances.Local governments, the churches, and the media should make community service a“cool” activity instead of a punishment. They should encourage feeding the poorand homeless. Public relations campaigns could raise awareness on matters ofcommunity relevance. Local governments should encourage the start of programssuch as the Works Projects Administration (WPA) of the Great Depression era inwhich the unemployed were put to work on public projects such as roads, dams,and waterways. Applicants for unemployment compensation could be put to work injobs provided by local government. They could not be fired from such public jobsbut would be required to register and show up for work each workday. Puttingpeople in jobs would not only restore dignity to those out of work and reducethe welfare rolls, but might actually produce much-needed public improvements.Taxpayers would be getting something for their money.As Benjamin Franklin once noted, “Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom.As nations become more corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-41]FINANCE CAPITALISM [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-41]CAPITALISM LIES AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. THE legacy of abuse of thissystem is death and misery. Though it’s an imperfect measure, we can begin tosee the impact of finance capitalism in the spike in suicides in areas affectedby the recent financial collapse. Since the beginning of the worldwide financialrecession in 2008, there have been more than ten thousand suicides in NorthAmerica and Europe, according to the British Journal of Psychiatry. Researcherssaid this nearly 10 percent rise in deaths was due to lost jobs, lowered homeprices, stock losses, and dwindling pensions.Furthermore, since 2002 the number of workers collecting Social SecurityDisability Insurance (SSDI) checks grew 48 percent, half of whom claimeddisability due to mental or mood disorders to include back pain. Dead anddisabled Americans are among the most obvious reminders of the rise of giantmultinational corporations and banks whose globalist leadership is advancing anagenda of increasingly tight control and depopulation—and all for enormousprofit.The globalist agenda has been revealed for years but almost never discussed inthe corporate-controlled mass media. As far back as 1966, Carroll Quigley, aGeorgetown University professor of history and a mentor to former president BillClinton, himself a member of an international anglophile network he saidoperated in secrecy, wrote in his book Tragedy and Hope, “The powers offinancial capitalism had a far-reaching aim—nothing less than to create a worldsystem of financial control in private hands able to dominate the politicalsystem of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system wasto be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world actingin concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings andconferences.”Quigley explained that central banks, including the Fed, would dominategovernments by their ability to control treasury loans, to manipulate foreignexchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to“influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in thebusiness world.”Global banking interests, centered in the Bank for International Settlements(BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), along with little-knownagencies, can be found at the center of efforts to destabilize sovereign nationsacross the world, converting citizens into debt slaves to the globalist bankingsystem.Because of a growing list of broadcast and Internet talk-show hosts and causessuch as the “Occupy” movement, more and more Americans have become aware of theidea of a New World Order composed of wealthy globalists and their bankinginterests. This concept was considered merely a conspiracy theory only a fewshort years ago, but today the snickering has subsided as the effects of thisagenda become more obvious every day.HIDDEN TOOLS OF FINANCEGLOBALISTS, THAT ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION COMPOSED OF super-richindividuals who own or control the earth’s major corporations and resources, arehighly adept at using little-known financial mechanisms in order to gain controlover the world economy. One such hidden tool is the Exchange Stabilization Fund(ESF) of the United States Treasury. This little-known agency has morphed into agigantic money-moving operation with absolutely no oversight by the U.S.government, the states, or the American people. Yet the ESF is supported bytaxpayer dollars and uses its funds to carry out covert operations both insideand outside the country.The ESF was created and originally financed by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934,then considered one of the most important bills to come before Congress sincethe Civil War because it shifted U.S. financial polices from Federal Reservebanks to the treasury, and hence, the ESF. Its purpose, according to an officialdescription, was “to contribute to exchange rate stability and counterdisorderly conditions in the foreign exchange market.” The act authorized thesecretary of the treasury to deal exclusively in gold, foreign exchange,securities, and instruments of credit subject to the approval of the president.The ESF is the mechanism by which short-term loans are made to foreigngovernments. As of December 2014, the ESF held more than $95 billion in assets.When ownership of gold was outlawed for Americans in 1933, the ESF transferredgold out of the country to foreigners in exchange for dollars, in turn drainingour gold reserves for years to come. Today, when people blame the FederalReserve for stealing America’s gold reserves, they should know that it wasactually the ESF, the agency never scrutinized or questioned by Congress, thatdrained the Federal Reserve many years ago.In 1978, under agreements with the IMF, Congress amended the Gold Reserve Act toallow the ESF to provide short-term credit to foreign governments and monetaryauthorities. These ESF “bridge loans” are financed through currency swaps, whichmeans dollars held by the ESF are made available to a country through itscentral bank in exchange for the same value in that country’s currency. The ESFalso administers special drawing rights (SDRs), assets created by the IMF thenloaned to countries requiring help in financing balance-of-payment deficits.SDRs are permanent resources of the ESF, whose operations are conducted throughthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed acts as an intermediarybetween the ESF and those foreign governments seeking short-term financing.The independent nature of the ESF has alarmed many observers. According to somemembers of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures who reviewedthe gold reserve law during its preparation, “This [law] in fact, means that theSecretary of the Treasury shall be under no obligation to comply with generallaws of the United States in the handling of this fund . . . We believe that[this] places autocratic and dictatorial power in the hands of one man directlyover the control of the value of money and credit and indirectly over prices . .. We believe that this is too great a power to place in the hands of any oneman. We believe that it is contrary to every true principle of AmericanGovernment.”In 1940, treasury officials began calling the ESF its “secret weapon,” asmillions of dollars were loaned to China to resist the Japanese invasion and toArgentina to defend against Nazi influence. Some isolationist members ofCongress were unhappy with these expenditures of American tax money and weredoubly unhappy to learn that the ESF was under no obligation to follow U.S.laws.The ESF has continued to hold tremendous sway over global financial policy andhas been described as the largest financial agency in the world. After World WarII, ESF chief Harry Dexter White helped design the world’s new monetary system,including its best-known creations—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and theWorld Bank.White concurrently served on many government committees including one thatfounded the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), forerunner of the CIA. Today,the ESF has copycat agencies in many states and itself has been accused of beinga slush fund for CIA “black operations.” There are even accusations oflaundering drug money. The fund operates outside of legislative oversight andpublic scrutiny and, while technically legal, outside of the intentions of theU.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.According to Lawrence Houston, the first general counsel of the CIA, “The heartand soul of covert operations is . . . the provisions of un-vouchered funds, andthe inviolability of such funds from outside inspection.” This is accomplishedthrough hidden mechanisms such as the ESF.In 2008, when the Federal Reserve borrowed $90.3 billion to bail out thebankrupt American International Group (AIG), the funds came through the ESF,where some staffers worried that Congress might object if the ESF’s role wasdiscovered.Former presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul has called the ESF a “slush fund”hidden within the Federal Reserve System. “The initial funding of the programcame from taking the gold in from the people and then revaluing up so they hadsome money. So it’s off-budget budgeting. Congress doesn’t keep appropriatingmoney. They [the ESF] can earn enough interest buying Treasury bills . . . Butthey can interfere in the market.,” explained Paul.The hidden nature of the ESF has caused the media to refer merely to “monetaryauthorities” when it means the ESF and allows the Fed to take the blame for anymistakes.Eric de Carbonnel, a prolific blogger at MarketSkeptics.com, has produced avideo series revealing an immense amount of information on the ESF. He concludedthat the agency “controls the New York Fed, runs the CIA’s black budget, and isthe architect of the world’s monetary system (IMF, World Bank, etc.). ESFfinancing (through the OSS and then the CIA) built up the worldwide propagandanetwork which has so badly distorted history today (including erasing awarenessof its existence from popular consciousness). It has been directly involved invirtually every major U.S. fraud/scandal since its creation in 1934: the Londongold pool, the Kennedy assassinations, Iran-Contra, CIA drug trafficking, HIV,and worse.”The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is another example of the global elite’shidden centralized control over the economy. The FSB was created in 2009 whenPresident Obama signed an agreement at a London meeting of the G20.Marilyn M. Barnewall, described by Forbes as the “dean of American privatebanking,” noted, “It seems the world’s bankers have executed a bloodless coupand now represent all of the people in the world . . . President Obama agreed atthe G20 meeting in London to create an international board with authority tointervene in U.S. corporations by dictating executive compensation and approvingor disapproving business management decisions . . . Under the new FinancialStability Board, the United States has only one vote. In other words, the groupwill be largely controlled by European central bankers. My guess is, they willrepresent themselves, not you and not me and certainly not America.”The FSB was merely an outgrowth of the Financial Stability Committee of the Bankfor International Settlements (BIS), which was controlled by the Nazis untilafter World War II. The FSB will oversee the Federal Reserve System, theSecurities and Exchange Commission, and other federal agencies, thus effectivelyplacing U.S. economic policy in the hands of international bankers.This handful of bankers is behind the flow of money necessary for the mergersand acquisitions of other banks. Once there were hundreds of banks in America,owned by individuals and local families. But due to government regulations putinto place during the Reagan-Bush years, these banks either faded away orconsolidated. In 1990, there were thirty-seven major banks in the U.S. By 2009,buyouts, mergers, and bankruptcies had reduced this number to four: Citigroup,JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Ominously, in June 2012, thegiant global rating agency Moody’s downgraded the ratings of Bank of America,Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, citing concerns for the stability of the world’sfinancial system. The International Monetary Fund’s 2014 Global FinancialStability Report, noted that efforts to stabilize the world’s financial systemswere far from complete and conditions “far from normal.” The report stated thatthe probability of more taxpayer bailouts of “too important to fail” banksremains high.A LONGSTANDING PLANPUBLIC APPREHENSION OVER THE PRACTICES OF LARGE BANKS IS nothing new. Citizenshave long been concerned by the state of the banking industry. In 1922, formerNew York City mayor John F. Hylan warned, “The real menace of our Republic isthe invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs overour cities, states and nation . . . a small group of powerful banking housesgenerally referred to as the international bankers. The little coterie ofpowerful international bankers virtually run[s] the United States government fortheir own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties, writepolitical platforms, make cat’s-paws of party leaders, use the leading men ofprivate organizations, and resort to every device to place in nomination forhigh public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates ofcorrupt big business.”Even worse, Hylan explains, they control the flow of information to the generalpublic. “These international bankers and Rockefeller–Standard Oil interestscontrol the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They usethe columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of officepublic officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliqueswhich compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of aself-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies,schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.”The long-standing plan to financially subjugate citizens of the U.S. is nosecret. The average citizen understands it better than thecorporation-controlled mass media. The plan was articulated in 1924 by MontaguNorman, governor of the Bank of England. Addressing the American BankersAssociation in New York City, Norman explained, “Capital must protect itself inevery possible way, both by combination and legislation. Debts must becollected, mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible. When, through process oflaw, the common people lose their homes, they will become more docile and moreeasily governed through the strong arm of the government applied by a centralpower of wealth under leading financiers.“These truths are well known among our principal men, who are now engaged informing an imperialism to govern the world. By dividing the voter through thepolitical party system, we can get them to expend their energies in fighting forquestions of no importance. It is thus, by discrete action, we can secure forourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished.”This consolidation of wealth has changed the United States from a democraticrepublic under the rule of law with ordered liberty guided by the Constitutionand Bill of Rights into a fascist state at the forefront of an effort toestablish a New World Order ruled by the banking interests and controlled bymultinational corporations.American publisher and free-speech advocate Larry Flynt in a blog for theHuffington Post described the situation thusly, “The American government—whichwe once called our government—has been taken over by Wall Street, themega-corporations and the super-rich. They are the ones who decide our fate. Itis this group of powerful elites, the people President Franklin D. Rooseveltcalled ‘economic royalists,’ who choose our elected officials—indeed, our veryform of government. Both Democrats and Republicans dance to the tune of theircorporate masters. In America, corporations do not control the government. InAmerica, corporations are the government [emphasis in the original].”The late outspoken comedian George Carlin offered this unfunny view of theglobalists: “They don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable ofcritical thinking . . . They want OBEDIENT WORKERS [emphasis in the original].People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, andjust dumb enough to passably accept all these increasingly shittier jobs withthe lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, andthe vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.”The financial crisis in the U.S. today, with its unequal income distribution,disproportionate executive pay, continuing housing and derivative bubbles,coupled with NSA surveillance, the Patriot Act, intrusive TSA manhandling,Homeland Security, ever-more-restrictive gun laws, militarized police forces,torture, and the classification of government critics as “potential terrorists,”is looking more like the country portrayed in The Hunger Games films than thedemocratic republic handed down by the forefathers.This situation did not come about overnight. Wealthy elites have attempted tocontrol North America since the colonization of the continent began, and theseefforts began to gain traction with the rise of the Robber Barons in the latenineteenth century. Efforts to curb the excesses of unfettered capitalism afterthe turn of the twentieth century have resulted in the centralization of powerin the federal government, which has been given greater authority to regulateindustry even as the creation of collective bargaining attempted to give morepower to workers.Yet rather than leveling the playing field of the owner-worker relationship,these efforts have only bolstered the few who hold real power on each side.Union power has declined sharply even as labor leaders hobnob with businessowners in country clubs and business organizations.In politics, money talks. In fact, it screams. Any politician knows that thesurest way to winning an election is to buy huge amounts of time on television.TV networks and stations want political advertising paid up front and airtime iscostly. This system almost assures that political office will go to whichevercandidate spends the most on TV ads, not to whoever might be best qualified.And the court system does not appear to be the slightest bit concerned by thisarrangement. The Supreme Court recently ruled that corporations can beconsidered the same as individuals in that they may contribute unlimited amountsof money to the political candidate of their choice. This means largecorporations can gain political support by simply opening up their pocketbook.In reality, the ability to buy political influence has widened the gap betweenthe wealthy elite and the working poor.The globalist elite are like parasites. They feed off the population all thewhile soothing us, even as they plot our extermination, as will be detailedlater.These are the same elitists who engineered the rise of the Bolsheviks in 1917Russia but then grew fearful as the Bolsheviks turned communist and began urgingclass warfare worldwide. These same globalists next created national socialismin pre–World War II Germany in an attempt to confine socialism within nationalboundaries.Hitler, a German army intelligence agent, was an underling in this global rulingelite’s long-term ethnic extermination program, although he initially stated hewas fighting international finance and loan capital. The globalists turnedagainst Hitler only after he began building his Third Reich with Reichsmarks,interest-free money not borrowed from international bankers. After the war,thousands of unreconstructed Nazis were brought to America through such programsas Operation Paperclip. The Nazis who survived the war and their descendantshave steadily built a Fourth Reich, expanding from the military-industrialcomplex into corporate leadership. Along with Nazi technology, they brought Naziphilosophy, helping to explain why this elite continues to rule many nationstoday.Businessman and author J. R. Dunn, a consulting editor of the websiteAmericanthinker.com, details the shift that has taken place in the U.S. “Whatdoes this transformation look like overall? It involves drastically cut energysources, seriously limited forms of transportation, nineteenth-century (or evenmore primitive) health care, less food, expensive light sources, seriouslytruncated job opportunities, and higher education too expensive for any but theelite. In other words, Americans are to become poor, cold, hungry, and stupid,while sitting in the dark. That’s the progressive plan for the wealthiest nationin the long human record,” he wrote.Dunn goes on to address the rationales being used to impose control over thepublic. “The reasons behind this don’t matter; they are myriad, contradictory,and unconvincing—global warming, fairness, equality, sharing the wealth. Theychange from week to week at convenience. Because the only true reason is power.The elite does it because they can.”The placement of Nazi scientists in the American system after World War II hasbeen well documented. The globalists who supported the Nazis merely moved themto the USA under projects such as Paperclip and implanted both technology andpolitical philosophy within the military-industrial complex. For decades, theyhave sought to create a world government controlled by a scientific dictatorshipand guided by the principles of eugenics—survival of the fittest.WHO ARE “THEY”?ONE ALWAYS HEARS OF “THEM.” YET IT IS SIMPLISTIC TO BLAME THE amorphous “them”for everything that is wrong with contemporary society. “They” are greedycapitalists. “They” are behind the banking excesses, the military adventurism,and the social engineering. “They” control the news media. “They” want us dead.“They” want to reduce the world’s population. “They” are trying to rule theworld through world government.But who exactly are “they”?They are the global corporate masters who have guided modern America to aculture of death—from deadly drugs, food, water, and air to violententertainment and blood sports. The culture of death created by greedyglobalists has pervaded every aspect of American life.To some conspiracy researchers, these globalists are collectively referred to asthe Bilderbergers, a group of powerful men and women—many of them Europeanroyalty—who meet in seclusion each year reportedly to discuss the issues of theday. The group is called the Bilderbergers because its existence was firstdiscovered by the public in 1954 after a meeting at the Bilderberg Hotel inOosterbeek, Holland. In the past, both government and media officials declinedto even mention the Bilderberg meetings, writing off concern over theirgatherings as a conspiracy theory. But in recent years that has all changed. Thealternative media, and even some mainstream news sources, have begun coveringthe annual meetings.The official explanation for Bilderberg gatherings is that they are justfriendly get-togethers of prominent business and government leaders and theirdiscussions are kept private to encourage an open exchange of ideas. But justconsider the cries of “restraint of trade,” “monopoly,” and “price fixing” thatwould erupt should, say, the owners of the National Football League franchisesgather behind closed doors, surrounded by armed guards, and refuse to publiclysay what they discussed.A list of reported attendees from the secretive Bilderberg meeting held inCopenhagen in May 2014 can be found in the appendix. These names will not meanmuch to the reader because most of these men and women are rarely mentioned inthe corporate mass media. Yet they collectively represent a concentration ofwealth and power unequaled in the modern world.These are a substantial number of “they” who once a year meet to deliberate thefate of national economies and, hence, entire populations. Many of them alsobelieve in the mandate of eugenics, the practice of improving the human race toinclude reducing the population.Know that we do not have the names of every attendee. Only those who authorizethe release of their names get mentioned in the public media. Daniel Estulin,author of The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, wrote that the group’smembership and meeting participants have represented a “who’s who” of the worldpower elite with familiar names like David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Billand Hillary Clinton, Gordon Brown, Angela Merkel, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke,Larry Summers, Tim Geithner, Lloyd Blankfein, George Soros, Donald Rumsfeld,Rupert Murdoch, other heads of state, influential senators, congressmen, andparliamentarians, Pentagon and NATO brass, members of European royalty, selectedmedia figures, and invited others. Such invitees have included President Obamaalong with many of his top officials.Estulin said that also represented at Bilderberg meetings are leading figuresfrom the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), IMF, World Bank, the TrilateralCommission, EU, and powerful central bankers from the Federal Reserve, theEuropean Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England.David Rockefeller, the head of the Rockefeller family financial empire, isbelieved to have been a leading Bilderberg attendee for years. Other wealthyelite members merely send representatives.An official with Switzerland’s Credit Suisse bank has estimated the entire netwealth of the world at more than $440 trillion, which is expected to rise in thecoming years. By some estimates, the Rothschild banking dynasty reportedlycontrols up to $300 trillion in assets. In the US, the Rockefeller family isestimated by some to be worth about $100 trillion. If the estimates areaccurate, these families collectively own or control virtually all the world’smajor banks, multinational corporations, conglomerates, and oil companies. Theyalso own massive real estate holdings such as castles, palaces, statelymansions, luxury hotels, racetracks, casinos, exotic holiday resorts, along withlarge tracts of farmland and uncut forest in various countries, which explainsthe lack of certainty as to their wealth.Mike O’Sullivan, a chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, told CNBC that thetop richest one percent of the world’s population owns 46 percent of globalassets. And it is all centered in the world’s largest banks.A 2011 study by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology inZurich found that only about two dozen multinational banks—named were BarclaysBank, JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs—controlled upward of forty-threethousand transnational corporations.George Sugihara, a complex systems expert and adviser to Deutsche Bank,remarked, “It’s disconcerting to see how connected things really are.”Such a concentration of power, cemented by greed, wealth, and class loyalty, hasled to policies perhaps not in the best interests of all humankind. It thereforecomes as no surprise that it is within the global elite where the instigators ofplans to reduce the human population must be found."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-43]DEATH OF THE SPECIES [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-43]IT’S NOT ONLY TOXIC ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, STRANGE DISABILITIES, diseases, andauthoritarian policies that are leading to the demise of the human race. Forseveral years now, in many parts of the world, scientists and fertility doctorshave found that men’s sperm count and motility (sperm movement) are declining,making it more difficult for couples to have babies. One 2012 study in Franceestimated that for thirty-five-year-old men, all else remaining equal, spermconcentration dropped from 73.6 million per milliliter (ml) in January 1989 to49.9 million/ml by December 2005. A fertility clinic study of seven thousand menin Aberdeen, Scotland, led by Dr. Siladitya Bhattacharya found that the averagesperm count of those men with a normal sperm concentration (more than 20 millionsperm per milliliter) in the group fell from nearly 87 million to just over 62million over fourteen years, a 29 percent drop.An earlier Danish study found sperm counts had dropped by one percent every yearsince 1938. Organizations such as the Center for Reproductive Epidemiology atthe University of Rochester Medical Center have announced similar findings.Center director Dr. Shanna Swan, acknowledges that while such studies are farfrom definitive, the center’s data place yearly sperm declines at 1.5 percent inthe U.S. and 3 percent in Europe and Australia.Oddly, although some researchers consider the continuing decline in sperm counta “crisis,” no recent studies have been published.University of Edinburgh professor Richard Sharpe comments, “‘In the UK thisissue has never been viewed as any sort of health priority, perhaps because ofdoubts as to whether ‘falling sperm counts’ was real. Now there can be littledoubt that it is real, so it is a time for action. Doing nothing will ensurethat couple fertility and average family size will decline below even itspresent low level and place ever greater strains on society.”Some see declining sperm counts as the result of radiation poisoning fromFukushima and Chernobyl, while others believe it is the result of harmfulchemicals in the food and water supply. Some blame lower sperm counts onbisphenol A (BPA), an additive in plastics found in many household products orpesticides, as scientists have noticed that men from rural areas where farmingpesticides are common have lower sperm counts than men from urban areas. Otherscite sexually transmitted infections, stress, obesity, and even watchingtelevision as the culprits.It would appear that the truth behind lowering sperm counts can be attributed toa combination of these environmental factors, along with the adulteration of thehuman food supply with toxic additives and chemicals, as previously described.All of this has been fostered by the aforementioned giant multinationalcorporations. These corporations are run by able administrators under the ordersof shadowy owners, whose names are largely unknown to the public, but many maybe found on the membership list of the Bilderbergers.If these current trends continue, humanity’s days on earth may be numbered. Byrecognizing the disastrous end awaiting the population and taking action now,the American public can begin to move toward solutions and remedies that canbring a more peaceful and prosperous future. Many of these problems begin withproper education.THE DEATH OF REAL EDUCATIONIN A CULTURE DEDICATED TO LIFE, AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION should be offered toall those who wish to attend a college or university. There was a time inAmerica when a young person from a family of limited means could work his or herway through college. But today such opportunity is often unavailable. Accordingto the Washington Post, the average cost of higher education rose by 307 percentbetween 1989 and 2010, while the average income of workers rose a mere 70percent.Today, it is impossible for a working student to make enough for a collegeeducation. Back in 1979, an academic credit at Michigan State University cost$24.50. A student making the then minimum wage of $2.90 per hour could pay foran hour’s credit with one day’s work. Adjusted for inflation, that would be is$79.23 in today dollars. One credit hour today costs $428.75. Today, a studentearning 2014’s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would need to work sixty hours toearn enough to pay for one credit hour.What has led to such a drastic shift in the economics of higher education? Somehave pointed to the large amounts of money giant corporations donate to collegesand universities. What might first appear as philanthropy, many see as merelyinstilling corporate views in the learning process.A coalition of academics and activists have endorsed “A National Call: SaveCivilian Public Education.” Its website explains, “Over the last severaldecades, the Pentagon, conservative forces, and corporations have beensystematically working to expand their presence in the K-12 learning environmentand in public universities. The combined impact of the military, conservativethink tanks and foundations and of corporatization of our public educationalsystems has eroded the basic democratic concept of civilian public education. Itis a trend that, if allowed to continue, will weaken the primacy of civilianrule and, ultimately, our country’s commitment to democratic ideals.”This group points to such programs as ROTC (Reserve Officers’ Training Corps),the closed-circuit-TV Channel One beamed into eight thousand schools, corporatecontracts for providing brand-name food and soft drinks, and the proliferationof private charter and “cyber” schools, arguing that these destroy thetraditional objective of American public education. “The cumulative effect isthe creation of institutions that cultivate a simplistic ideology that mergesconsumerism with subservience,” they said.And indeed, despite national efforts such as “No Child Left Behind,” “CommonCore,” and programs like “school choice,” and “recovery school districts,”American public education has continued to decline for five decades.Tom Allon, owner of Manhattan Media and a Republican candidate for mayor of NewYork City, writes, “First of all, our children are not being stimulated from anearly age and many lose interest in learning by the time they are in elementaryschool. We think that the ‘one size fits all’ public education system, anindustrial model designed in the mid-1900s, should work in this post-informationand digital age. This is clearly wrong and we must now design curricula that setevery child’s mind ‘on fire,’ even if it means using digital technology muchmore in the classroom and incorporating online learning as well as animation andvocational training, for those who are not traditional academic learners.”Pointing to a study by the National Council for Accreditation of TeacherEducation, Allon argues that teacher preparation today is woefully inadequate.“Training teachers is not a one-week series of seminars before their first daysin the classroom. It’s not a theoretical class in one of our educationalgraduate programs. It must represent at least three, if not four, years ofvigorous apprenticeship as a student teacher before entering the classroom as alead teacher and then a five-to-ten-year series of mentoring programs that areconducted by ‘master teachers’ or ‘mentors,’ two new tiers of teaching that Iwould recommend to remedy our teacher training and retaining crisis (50 percentof American teachers leave the profession in their first five years).” Allonespecially points to one “intangible thing necessary to lift our country out ofour downward spiral: R-E-S-P-E-C-T [emphasis in the original] for teachers andthe teaching profession.”“The path to education victory is not as simple as A-B-C. But it’s also not ashard as the Pythagorian theorem. It just takes a paradigm shift for our electedleaders to stop searching for scapegoats and start acting like realsuperheroes,” wrote Allon. “Our kids—this generation and the next one—can’t waitany longer. We need the fierce urgency of now to stop the educational insanitywhich plagues our society. But first we must put our teachers and studentsfirst—ahead of politicians and the testing industry.”Allon’s call for respect was echoed by Dennis Van Roekel, president of theNational Educators Association (NEA) in a speech before the 2012 NEA nationalmeeting. Roekel noted, “We all know there are plenty of people who are eager tooffer advice—or worse, try to impose their ideas on our profession—bloggers,columnists, elected officials, and self-proclaimed reformers, they areconstantly weighing in about public education . . . they love to talk about andblame teachers. As if this disjointed and underfunded system is somehow thefault of those who teach and the people who work in those schools. But the realproblems are the profiteers and mega-rich Wall Street folks who created aneconomic crisis that has our country and the world reeling. And the solutionisn’t to attack educators, it’s to give respect. That’s what will attracttalented young people to become teachers and education support professionals andcollege professors.”Van Roekel says the reason we must support education is simple: “Publiceducation makes America strong. Studying history and civics helps studentsbecome good citizens. Part of a democratic republic. Public education is avehicle to teach American values and ideals, values like a just society, equalopportunity, and democracy. And in a nation where equal opportunity is one ofour most deeply held values, education is a key that opens the door to economicopportunity, for people from all backgrounds.”Legal researcher Shayna A. Pitre, writing on The Blog said America could learn afew things from other countries whose students rate higher in education tests.“Only when the United States does this, and learns the right lessons from thesecountries’ practices, will the era of education reform truly arrive,” she said.Pitre describes successful tactics employed by foreign teachers, tactics thatlead to quality education. Teachers more highly trained in colleges that demandhigh grades, they train and complete student teaching before landing a job, theyreceive pay commensurate with other professions, they teach more criticalthinking skills such as problem solving rather than rote memorization, and theyuse non-computerized international standard testing that requires students towork out complex problems.Some suggestions to bring American education back its earlier success include:improving training for teachers; getting the best teachers to mentor the others;teaching both teachers and students to be critical thinkers and problem solvers;allowing students to learn at their own pace and in their own way as opposed toone teacher telling thirty-five kids to do the same thing at the same time;getting parents more involved in the education process; and addressing the issueof bunching together too many kids from impoverished backgrounds in inadequateschools.America’s Founding Fathers’ writings were based on the concept of the worth andpower of the individual. Individualism was once viewed as an admirable trait. Itconjured up pictures of the rugged cowboy, honest lawman, and brave soldiers.In the midnineteenth century, a great civil war was fought over states’ rights,a term that has today become unfashionable and linked to bigotry andprovincialism. Yet politicians still extol the virtues of an individual’srights. This dichotomy begs the question of how a person can have personalindividual rights but not states’ rights?In today’s world of political correctness, one can talk of the “individual”within certain limited contexts, noted Jon Rappoport, author of Power Outsidethe Matrix. “You can say ‘power,’ if you’re talking about nuclear plants, or ifyou’re accusing someone of a crime, but if you put ‘individual’ and ‘power’together and attribute a positive quality to the combination, you’re way, wayoutside the consensus. You’re crazy.”Audiences today still see individual power extolled as a virtue in movies,television, video games, comics, and graphic novels. The entertainment industrypresents a wide variety of cops, secret agents, spacemen, and superheroes andheroines who succeed on their individualism and wits.“But when it comes to ‘real’ life, power stops at the front door and no oneanswers the bell,” said Rappoport. “Suddenly, the hero, the person with power,is anathema . . . So he adjusts. He waits. He wonders. He settles for less, farless. He learns how the game is played. He stifles his hopes. He shrinks. Heforgets. He develops ‘problems’ and tries to solve them within an impossiblynarrow context. He redefines success and victory down to meet limitedexpectations. He strives for the normal and the average. For his efforts, hereceives tidbits, like a dog looking up at his master. If that isn’t mindcontrol, nothing is.”Today, the globalists, through control of government, the education system, andthe mass media, have advanced the idea of collectivism, subordinating theindividual to the “greater good of the group.” Young people are beingconditioned to blindly follow instruction and learn by rote instead of honingthe skills of independent thinking and deductive reasoning.This must change. Liberty and an effective democracy demand citizens who canthink critically and for themselves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-45]DEATH OF THE MASS MEDIA [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-45]THE CORPORATE MASS MEDIA IS ANOTHER AREA THAT MUST BE REFORMED if we are tofight against the wishes of the global elite. Interestingly, there is evidencethat the mass media behemoth is in decline.In the 1960s, only three TV networks—ABC, CBS, and NBC—dominated the broadcastaudience, creating a centrist consensus of life in the United States. During theweekend of the Kennedy assassination, the entire nation watched in shock asevery major media outlet preempted normal programming and stories to deal withthe tragedy.The concentration of media was a double-edged sword to the corporate elite. Onthe one hand, official pronouncements could swiftly reach nearly the entirenation, while on the other, contradictory and antiestablishment messages coulddo the same if they broke into the major media. Life magazine exemplified thisdichotomy by publishing evidence of conspiracy in the assassination even whilesupporting the government’s lone-assassin theory.Slowly, the rise of cable TV, along with the buyout of homegrown newspapers bylarge corporations, altered the media landscape. On September 11, 2001,subscribers could turn from the coverage of the 9/11 attacks to watch the DisneyChannel or ESPN.Since that time, listenership has become divided between broadcast, cable,satellite, and the Internet, and advertising revenues for the mass media havecontinued to decline, prompting some commentators to claim that TV is dead. Itis true that where once a single episode of the western series Gunsmoke couldcapture more than 40 percent of the TV audience, today’s most popular shows arelucky to garner 10 percent of the audience.As far back as 1993, novelist Michael Crichton predicted that the majorestablished media, which he termed “Mediasaurus,” would become as extinct as thedinosaurs within a decade. Comparing the American corporate media to a used car,Crichton argued that it was of “very poor quality,” and that “its information isnot reliable, it has too much chrome and glitz, its doors rattle, it breaks downalmost immediately, and it’s sold without warranty. It’s flashy but it’sbasically junk.”Critics today likewise view television news as quick and cheap programming thatis repetitive, simplistic, and insulting. Cable-TV news is viewed aspredominately unqualified talking heads, and newspaper reporting as mostlyrewritten press releases full of unnamed sources.Many see news stories today as no more than opinion pieces that reflect thezealotry and intolerance of advocates. Clay Shirky, a professor of new media atNew York University and author of Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosityin a Connected Age, noted, “Years ago, it wasn’t necessarily news that peoplewanted to watch when they got home. They just wanted to watch TV, and the newswas what was on. Once they were given the option of ESPN, viewers couldn’tchange channels fast enough. This removed the population of politicallyuncommitted viewers from the news audience, leaving only the partisans.”Some suggest that in view of the mass media’s lack of objective and reflectivestudies of current events, Americans today live in an age of conformity muchmore confining than the 1950s.Crichton was not the first commentator to point out the nefarious vapidness ofthe mass media. In 1967, Marshall McLuhan wrote The Medium Is the Massage: AnInventory of Effects, detailing how the media controls content and how contentis received by the individual. One glaring example of the corporate mass media’stwisting of words can be found in his famous adage “the medium is the message.”However, in both his book’s title and in his conclusion, McLuhan stated that“the medium is the massage.” But today, the corporate media usually employs theword “message” rather than “massage,” no doubt because media moguls do not wantthe average citizen to consider the idea that messages are being “massaged”before being brought to the public.“As it turns out, the traditional television business is far stickier thanpeople thought, and audience behavior is not changing as rapidly as peoplethought it might,” said analyst Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research. “Yes,television viewing went down in 2012 for the first time, but people are stillwatching five hours a day. YouTube is growing, but people are watching eightminutes a day. They are where cable was in 1980.” But in Greenfield’sestimation, it will not take thirty years for the Internet and YouTube tosurpass broadcast and cable television in viewership.This is happening already. According to estimates by Wall Street media analystsCraig Moffett and Michael Nathanson, in the third quarter of 2013, cablecompanies lost 687,000 subscribers. “Viewers are abandoning their TV sets towatch on new devices and through new distribution channels,” explained Shirky.“From 2011 to 2012, the number of videos streamed on tablets and smartphonesrose 300 percent, with digital outlets like YouTube, Hulu, Netflix and Amazoncapturing both new users and more time spent.”While predictions of the death of mass media might be premature, there does seemto be some truth in them, particularly in regard to the print media. “As we passhis prediction’s fifteen-year anniversary, I’ve got to declare advantageCrichton,” admitted Jack Shafer, editor-at-large for Slate.com in 2008. “Rotafflicts the newspaper industry, which is shedding staff, circulation, andrevenues. It’s gotten so bad in newspaperville that some people want Google tobuy the Times and run it as a charity! Evening news viewership continues toevaporate, and while the mass media aren’t going extinct tomorrow, Crichton’soriginal observations about the media future now ring more true than false. Askany journalist.”While the U.S. was once a nation with a great variety of newspapers andperiodicals, today virtually everything a person sees or hears is coming fromone of only five multinational corporations—the Walt Disney Company, NewsCorporation, Time-Warner, and Viacom (which now includes CBS) and the Germanpublishing giant Bertelsmann. These five giants not only control the newspapersbut for most of them also radio and television networks, movie studios,magazines, cable and satellite outlets, music companies, and even billboards.A study by Project Censored, a nonprofit media research group managed throughthe School of Social Sciences at Sonoma State University, revealed the largestmedia companies are actually interconnected by common owners and board members.Within ten major media corporations, there were 118 individuals who sat on 288different national and international corporate boards. The study also documentedmedia directors who had served as former senators or representatives, revealinga “revolving door” relationship between corporate media and U.S. governmentofficials.Concentration of media ownership has resulted in progressively fewer individualsor organizations controlling increasing shares of the mass media, As more andmore media companies fall victim to the transnational corporations throughbuyouts and takeovers, a media oiligarchy has been created that dominates theindustry.The late C. Edwin Baker, professor of law and communication at the University ofPennsylvania Law School, in his book Media Concentration and Democracy: WhyOwnership Matters, questioned the support of deregulation and hypercommercialismdemonstrated by current media ownership. Baker argued that dispersal of mediaownership could result in more owners who would reasonably pursue sociallyvaluable journalistic or creative objectives rather than a sociallydysfunctional focus on the bottom line.Mass media monopoly can mean programming representing only the agenda of itsglobalist ownership, undue loyalty to both government and corporate advertisers,and censorship of free discourse in the public interest.Concentration of media has led to fights over deregulation. Proponents ofderegulation argue that the removal of government rules will allow commercialexploitation and thus increase profits, encourage more diverse ownership, andaid developing nations in acquiring their own media companies.Opponents say deregulation will only result in a more dangerous concentration ofownership by globalist corporations, reducing the diversity of information andopinions as well as the overall quality of programming.Though the business of television may appear healthy from the outside, it’sclear that a decline in the industry is ongoing. Even Fox News, long considereda success story of cable news, suffered the lowest audience numbers in more thana decade in 2014, according to an article on the Politico website. And a hugeproportion of viewers of Fox News (and other cable networks) are seniorcitizens. Younger viewers, the audience of the future, simply are not there.Hadas Gold of Politico shows just how dire the demographics are. “Take forexample, Bill O’Reilly’s show, The O’Reilly Factor,” Gold writes. “[In May 2014]O’Reilly had his lowest month since 2001 in the key [demographic], with 308,000viewers.” “Yes, O’Reilly is still the No. 1 program in cable news in both totaland demo viewers, averaging 2,136,000 total viewers in May. But the majority ofthose viewers are over the age of 55. In fact, the median age for O’Reilly isnow just over 72 years old. The average Fox News viewer overall is 68.8, whilethe average ages of MSNBC and CNN viewers were 62.5 and 62.8, respectively.”During 2015, in a scandal similar to that of NBC anchor Brian Williams, who wassuspended for six months for embellishing his involvement in a news story fromIraq, O’Reilly’s veracity was challenged by a list of misstatements attributedto him published on the Internet.Problems with audience and revenues are not limited to television. Print mediaalso appear to be dying, with only about 25 percent of the population indicatingconfidence in newspapers. At least 152 newspapers closed their doors in 2011alone, and print advertising revenues fell from $49 million in 2006 to $22million in 2012. This trend continued into 2014 with classified advertisingrevenues also declining.While print advertising continued to lose revenue, media made up some of thedifference with digital ad revenue, but not nearly enough. In 2012, the ratiowas about fifteen print dollars lost for every digital dollar gained.Although the decline in newspaper readership has been blamed on youngeraudiences deserting for electronic media, this is not the sole explanation.Total visits to newspaper websites decreased by 5 percent in 2012. The New YorkTimes led all U.S. newspapers in total audience, even though it too washemorrhaging readers, dropping from 4,442,074 in 2010 to 4,356,555 in 2012.According to the American Society of News Editors, full-time professionaleditorial staffs, which peaked at 56,900 in 1989, had, by the end of 2011,fallen by 29 percent. It was estimated that by 2014 newsroom staffs would dropbelow 40,000.Both print and electronic media run on the quest for larger audiences. Whichevermedium has the biggest audience gets the largest revenues. But this may be afalse predicate. It seems apparent from the loss of younger audiences that thesheer race for audience is not responsible for the death of the corporate massmedia. A 2013 Gallup poll showed that a whopping 77 percent of those polled saidthey did not trust mainstream television. Only Congress came in with worsenumbers, with less than 10 percent expressing any trust in the legislativebranch.Lack of trust rather than age may more fully explain the desertion of TVviewers. A 2014 Gallup poll showed Americans’ confidence in the media’s abilityto report was at an all-time low of 40 percent. Americans belief that thecorporate media present the news fully, accurately, and fairly has declinedsteadily from the relatively high levels of the late 1990s and the early 2000s.According to Gallup, “Though a sizable percentage of Americans continue to havea great deal or fair amount of trust in the media, Americans’ overall trust inthe Fourth Estate continues to be significantly lower now than it was ten tofifteen years ago.” The pollsters added that statistics showed that nationalelections particularly trigger skepticism about the accuracy of the news media’sreports.Unsurprisingly, Gallup reported 44 percent of Americans feel the news media are“too liberal.” Only 19 percent believe they’re too conservative, while 34percent, only about one in three, say the media are “just about right” in termsof their coverage.“The mainstream media has failed to inform us on so many levels. You can pickany day or week of the year, and observe the most trending news items litteringour television screens. What you’ll find is a news media that desperately holdsonto any celebrity gossip for days on end, and lies through its teeth at everyopportunity,” wrote Joshua Krause in the Daily Sheeple. Speaking about the lackof coverage of the 2014 meeting of the secretive Bilderberg group in Denmark,Krause voiced the thought of many young people by noting, “They failed to reporton the possibly earthshaking events that could unfold from a yearly meeting ofthe most powerful and influential people on earth. If they can’t do that, thenwhat are they good for?“The truth of our world is filled with awe and wonder. They could get all theratings they could possibly dream of, if they just told the truth. And yet, fromthe school textbooks of our formative years to the talking heads of our adultlives, every source of mainstream information appears to be a sanitized versionof the truth, or even an outright lie,” Krause added.Many ill-informed citizens believe the untrustworthiness of the mass media stemssimply from incomplete information presented by uninformed talking-head newsanchors, such superficial reporting due to sloppy and credulous reporters. Thosewho have studied the history of media corporate ownership and control come torealize that the lack of truthful information stems from a conscious agenda ofthe globalist owners. This agenda includes keeping antiestablishment viewpointsaway from the public and the repetitious presentation of pro-government andcorporate pronouncements.Proof of Krause’s idea of truth trumping the corporate mass media came in April2014 when Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, along with family, friends, andsupporters, stood off armed federal agents. Capping a twenty-year legal battleover grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and armed with afederal court order, officers began moving Bundy’s cattle off the land but werestopped by a Bundy blockade.There was an dramatic standoff between heavily armed participants on both sides.Local law enforcement joined BLM officers, while neighbors and supporters,including some militia members and ex-soldiers, joined the Bundys. Local sheriffDoug Gillespie defused the situation by negotiating with Bundy and ordered therelease of his cattle.Public reaction was decidedly mixed, with some terming Bundy a true patriot forresisting attempts by overreaching federal officials, while others said he waspromoting anarchy.The conventional corporate mass media only covered the Bundy story superficiallyand nearly always from the government’s point of view. What has been termed the“alternative media” rose to the occasion by reporting on the story as itunfolded. The Next New Network posted YouTube videos with updates on thesituation along with interviews with people on the scene; Pete Santilli ofGuerillaMediaNetwork.com reported live, while CNN aired a fluff segment on food.When it finally did report on the developing Bundy story, CNN announced,“Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted” whenlive video from the scene clearly showed canine officers siccing a dog onprotesters and shoving one woman to the ground.Other independent journalists, such as Matt Drudge and Adam Kokesh, reporteddevelopments as they occurred, while Alex Jones’ Infowars.com reporter KitDaniels dug into the backstory, which concerned Senate Majority Leader HarryReid’s alleged attempt to put Bundy out of business in order to carry out a planto build a $6 billion solar facility on the property once it was in governmenthands.Unlike the accounts of the Branch Davidian deaths at Waco, Texas, the OklahomaCity bombing, or even the account of the 9/11 attacks, during which the federalgovernment had near-total control over media coverage and therefore couldconstruct false narratives for public consumption, the Bundy story went straightto the citizenry via the alternative and social media. Such nontraditional formsof communication are beginning to outdistance conventional journalism. Citizenjournalists, armed with cell phones, are presenting a problem for corporate massmedia news. Increasingly, corporate and government officials are refusing totalk to any journalist they consider not working for a “credible” news outlet.“The bottom line is that the mainstream media thinks you are incredibly stupidand will buy anything they say, no matter how illogical or irrational it mightbe,” stated Mike Adams in an April 2014 article in NaturalNews. “What thealternative media has now proven is that the mainstream media is largelyirrelevant. It matters nothing what they print or broadcast. The people who areinformed know it’s all lies, and the mind-numbed propaganda victims who stillwatch [networks] like CNN and MSNBC are irrelevant to the march of historyanyway.“Real history is being shaped, investigated and reported by the alternativemedia. We are the ones who have no big corporate sponsors and no million-dollarbudgets, but we have the hearts and minds and passion for truth and justice thatdrives our work to levels of authenticity that the mainstream media can neverhope to attain . . . regardless of production budgets.”“The mainstream media is on its last breath, and they are already scurrying tosecure phony ‘alternative news’ websites in a bid to stay afloat, but the newera of news 2.0 is already here. And in this new paradigm of contentconsumption, reality is king,” wrote Anthony Gucciardi, host of the websiteStoryleak.com. “The mainstream media is afraid of the new media, they are afraidof you. If one man or woman with a smartphone can change history, that is ascary thought for the political control freaks who seek to censor you at everyturn. The new era of news consumption has arrived, and it’s time to kick themainstream media out for good.”Conservatives sometimes complain about the “liberal” media, but a serious lookreveals that the mainstream media only tilts liberal on certain social issuessuch as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. Otherwise, the so-calledliberal mass media is only as liberal as its corporate masters allow, withstories on corporate malfeasance and corruption getting short shrift.It has been shown that globalists spend huge sums of money manipulating mediaviewpoints. In early 2014, David Brock, a Democratic Party operative, revealedthat his organization, Media Matters for America (MMFA), uses money frombillionaire globalist George Soros to work directly with establishmentjournalists to influence the corporate media in an attempt to counteract thealternative and conservative media. White House visitor logs as reported in theDaily Caller, a twenty-four-hour news publication, showed that Brock and MMFAofficials met regularly with Obama aides including Deputy CommunicationsDirector Jen Psaki and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “Media Matters has nowbeen completely exposed as little more than an attack dog for the Obamaadministration,” accused Paul Joseph Watson on the Infowars website.Radio talk-show host and former NASA scientist Michael Rivero, a longtime mediacritic, summed it all up when he stated, “Most people prefer to believe thattheir leaders are just and fair, even in the face of evidence to the contrary,because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which he lives islying and corrupt, the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it. Totake action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life andloved ones. To choose to do nothing is to surrender one’s self-image of standingfor principles. Most people do not have the courage to face that choice. Hence,most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to givemoral cowards an excuse not to think at all.”Elliot D. Cohen is director of the Institute of Critical Thinking: NationalCenter for Logic-Based Therapy, and executive director of the NationalPhilosophical Counseling Association (NPCA). Writing in Project Censored 2014,Cohen stated, “It would be naive to expect a government that seeks power andcontrol over its citizens not [emphasis in the original] to use its influenceover the corporate media in order to spread self-serving propaganda. Inasmuch asthe corporate media need government to maximize their bottom line—through taxbreaks, military contracts, relaxed media ownership rules, access to itsofficials and spokespersons, as well as other incentives andkickbacks—government has incredible power and leverage over the corporate media.Thus, instead of blaming the government for having lied to and deceived itscitizens, better not to allow ourselves to be suckered into believing suchpropaganda in the first place. As this chapter argues, our liberties are mostvulnerable to faulty thinking and best defended by sound logic.”“A contemporary dictator would not need to do anything so obviously sinister asbanning the news,” says Alain de Botton, author of The News: A User’s Manual.“He or she would only have to see to it that news organizations broadcast a flowof random-sounding bulletins, in great numbers but with little explanation ofcontext, within an agenda that kept changing, without giving any sense of theongoing relevance of an issue that had seemed pressing only a short whilebefore, the whole interspersed with constant updates about the colorful anticsof murderers and film stars. This would be quite enough to undermine mostpeople’s capacity to grasp political reality—as well as any resolve they mightotherwise have summoned to alter it. The status quo could confidently remainforever undisturbed by a flood of, rather than a ban on, news . . . when newsfails to harness the curiosity and attention of a mass audience, a societybecomes dangerously unable to grapple with its own dilemmas and therefore tomarshal the popular will to change and improve itself.”The twenty-four-hour, seven-days-a-week news channels leave the impression thatthe American audience is well informed. This is not true. Airtime is filled withsuch a constant stream of disconnected and unprobed reports that it paints afalse, even grotesque picture of the world that herds viewers into conformity.Media critic Michael Parenti, a lecturer at a number of universities, noted thatviewers are bombarded with snippets such as “fighting broke out in the region,”or “many people were killed in the disturbances,” or “famine is on theincrease.” “Many things are reported in the news but few are explained. Littleis said about how the social order is organized and for what purposes. Insteadwe are left to see the world as do mainstream pundits, as a scatter of eventsand personalities propelled by happenstance, circumstance, confused intentions,bungled operations, and individual ambition—rarely by powerful class interests.”Parenti links class interest to “globalization, a pet label that the presspresents as a natural and inevitable development. In fact, globalization is adeliberate contrivance of multinational interests to undermine democraticsovereignty throughout the world.”But the answer can’t be just to intimidate people into consuming more “serious”news; it is to push so-called serious news outlets into learning to presentimportant information in ways that can properly engage audiences, advises deBotton. The challenge is to have mass media outlets offer thoughtful andmeaningful information—not just what happened but placed into a contextincluding the question of why something happened and who, if anyone, benefitted.“In the ideal news organization of the future, the ambitious tasks ofcontextualization and popularization would be taken so seriously that storiesabout welfare payments would be (almost) as exciting as those about incestuousantipodean cannibals,” he opined.With the loss of trust in the corporate mass media comes a new demand on theindividual to think for him or herself and to improve thought processes tofoster democracy and protect against totalitarianism.Better understanding of the realities of the world can be achieved by not justbelieving the status quo, but questioning it; looking for consistency in newsreports; being wary of fearmongering and media-induced stereotypes; searchingfor explanations and questioning all authority."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-47]COMING COLLAPSE? [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-47]BY THE MID-TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF commentators andauthors have been foreseeing American society collapsing from within, andrelatively soon. They see the causes of such a collapse as numerous, varied, butalso inevitable. One of the more prevalent theories involves a breakup of thefinancial system. Several financial forecasters in 2014 were predicting theimminent demise of the U.S. dollar and possibly the entire financial system.Some think such an eventuality might include major riots in the cities and eventhe imposition of martial law. As will be described later in this chapter, thereis even some evidence that the federal government is preparing for just such aneventuality.Such scary prospects are reported by commentators such as Harry Dent, who, inThe Great Depression Ahead, predicts, “The U.S. economy is likely to suffer aminor or major crash by early 2015 and another between late 2017 and late 2019or early 2020 at the latest.”“I think the crash of 2008 was just a speed bump on the way to the main event .. . the consequences are gonna be horrific . . . the rest of the decade [2010 to2020] will bring us the greatest financial calamity in history,” warned MikeMaloney, author and host of the Hidden Secrets of Money video series.“You saw what happened in 2008–2009, which was worse than the previous economicsetback because the debt was so much higher,” noted James “Jim” Rogers, chairmanof Rogers Holdings and Beeland Interests, Inc. “Well, now the debt isstaggeringly much higher, and so the next economic problem, whenever it happensand whatever causes it, is going to be worse than in the past, because we havethese unbelievable levels of debt, and unbelievable levels of money printing allover the world.”Jeff Berwick, financial editor of the Dollar Vigilante, predicted, “If theyallow interest rates to rise, it will effectively make the U.S. governmentbankrupt and insolvent, and it would make the U.S. government collapse . . .They are preparing for a major societal collapse. It is obvious and it willhappen, and it will be very scary and very dangerous.”David Stockman, former director of the Office of Management and Budget underPresident Ronald Reagan noted, “We have a massive bubble everywhere, from Japan,to China, Europe, to the UK. As a result of this, I think world financialmarkets are extremely dangerous, unstable, and subject to serious trouble anddislocation in the future.”“I can tell you as someone who absolutely aced academic mathematics in myyounger years that the global economy is headed for a disastrous debt collapse,”avowed Mike Adams, editor of NaturalNews, a popular website covering health andpolitics that boasts more than five million visitors monthly. “Trillions ofdollars of asset valuation (in derivatives) will vanish literally overnight.Widespread economic destruction will strike humanity like a thousand hurricaneshitting major population centers all across the world, all simultaneously. Thetiming of this is impossible to predict, but its inevitability is not. Whatreally alarms me about all this is knowing in advance that this event will usherin a global wave of poverty and destitution that is unprecedented in all ofhuman history. This is going to put honest, hard-working people on the streets,living in destitution, through no fault of their own. And the mere awareness ofknowing this is coming causes me tremendous pain.“Even worse, you and I can’t save them all. We can only teach people to getprepared and hope they have the wisdom to listen. We cannot make their decisionsfor them, and we cannot alter the laws of economic reality which dictate aglobal day of reckoning.”Several observers of the social scene have compared the decline of the AmericanEmpire to that of ancient Rome, noting that while the Roman authorities pacifiedthe masses with free bread and circuses filled with fighting gladiators, theAmerican public is provided low-cost processed food and fights on television.Internet commentator Jack Curtis, a frequent contributor to the website AmericanThinker, writes that America is running out of money “borrowed from itspressured citizens’ kids and grandkids via Federal Reserve ‘Quantitative Easing’games. “Nobody can live on promises forever,” noted Curtis. “Stock markets andbanks will shortly exhale the funny-money hot air sustaining them, interestrates will start their climb back to normal and the government will defundfirst, its war machine and foreign bribe programs, then its welfarebeneficiaries. As with the old Romans, American military will decline, alongwith cradle-to-grave social welfare. And American citizens are likely to seechange . . . more change than they expected that their president had in mind.Food stamps will be cut and huge salaries will disappear from pro sports. Asthat financial wave crests and begins to recede, America won’t be an empireanymore. It will have everything it can handle just tending to its ownbusiness.”Michael T. Snyder, publisher of The Economic Collapse Blog, foresees a greatstorm coming to America in the near future in the form of a takeover by China.“Chinese acquisition of U.S. businesses set a new all-time record [in 2013], andit is on pace to absolutely shatter that record this year. Meanwhile, China isvoraciously gobbling up real estate and is establishing economic beachheads allover America. If China continues to build economic power inside the UnitedStates, it will eventually become the dominant economic force in thousands ofsmall communities all over the nation.“And it is important to keep in mind that there is often not much of adifference between ‘the Chinese government’ and ‘Chinese corporations.’ In 2011,43 percent of all profits in China were produced by companies that the Chinesegovernment had a controlling interest in.”Devvy Kidd, a federal government whistle-blower, two-time congressionalcandidate, and author of Why a Bankrupt America, has written that an “outlaw”Congress has “destroyed our most important job sectors: industrial,manufacturing and agriculture via destructive, unconstitutional ‘free’ tradetreaties, turning America into a dying service economy. It must be reversed, butAmericans are going to go through hell before that can be accomplished.“The arrogant and ignorant in the fifty state capitols have refused to implementa constitutional sound money law,” she said. “So many of us warned until the(expletive) hit in August 2008, but the masses didn’t listen and they stillaren’t listening. The very worst is closing in on us, and when it finally hitsas it did in 2008, what’s going to happen? Social breakdown? Yes. Food riots. Ibelieve we’ll see that in certain parts of the country because (1) people arebroke and empty bellies make for angry mobs, and (2) there are serious problemswith our food and water supplies.”Brandon Smith, founder of the barter network Alternative Market Project, in a2014 article entitled “The Final Swindle of Private American Wealth Has Begun,”stated, “The financial crash of 2008, the same crash which has been ongoing foryears, is NOT [emphasis in the original] an accident. It is a concerted andengineered crisis meant to position the U.S. for currency disintegration and theinstitution of a global basket currency controlled by an unaccountablesupranational governing body like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). TheAmerican populace is being conditioned through economic fear to accept theinstitutionalization of global financial control and the loss of sovereignty.”Such critics are not the only ones who see a bleak future for America. A recentstudy, sponsored in part by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted acollapse of Western industrial civilization in the near future because ofincreasing income inequality along with the unsustainable exploitation ofresources. According to this study, the rise and fall of civilizations is arecurrent historical cycle in which “precipitous collapses—often lastingcenturies—have been quite common.” The independent research project wasconducted by a team of natural and social scientists under a NASA grant and wasaccepted for publication in the peer-reviewed Elsevier journal EcologicalEconomics, which covers both ecology and human economics.Looking at such factors as population, climate, water, agriculture, and energyin the decline and fall of past civilizations, researchers were able tocorrelate their findings with the world today. They found the two crucialfactors leading to collapse to be depletion of natural resources and “theeconomic stratification of society into Elites and Masses (or Commoners).” Inwords that recall the grievances publicized by the Occupy Movement, the studyfound fault not only with the pillaging of resources by wealthy capitalists, butalso observed that “accumulated surplus is not evenly distributed throughoutsociety, but rather has been controlled by an elite. The mass of the population,while producing the wealth, is only allocated a small portion of it by elites,usually at or just above subsistence levels.”Unsurprisingly, the study found that “commoners” are more likely to both see theabuse of resources and seek action to equalize income distribution than thewealthy elite, who are either oblivious to this “catastrophic trajectory” or “insupport of doing nothing.”Dr. Nafeez Ahmed, executive director of the Institute for Policy Research andDevelopment and author of A User’s Guide to the Crisis of Civilization: And Howto Save It, concluded, “The NASA-funded Human And Nature Dynamical (HANDY) model[namely, that wealth distribution today is unequally divided between ‘haves’ and“have-nots’] offers a highly credible wake-up call to governments, corporationsand business—and consumers—to recognize that ‘business as usual’ cannot besustained, and that policy and structural changes are required immediately.”A collapse due to social pressures may prove slow in coming. Other possibilitiescould be quick and varied. These include the setting off of an EMP(electromagnetic pulse) weapon, terrorist attacks in cities, a nuclear war, anational truckers strike, civil war, a cyber attack on computer systems,geophysical disasters such as the eruption of the Yellowstone caldera, and evenan asteroid strike from space.Drought conditions and lack of water also have the potential to be catastrophic,accelerating an agricultural collapse resulting in mass starvation. Even NBCNews reported on a looming crisis over water being drained from the OgallalaAquifer, a ten-million-year-old underground water source stretching from SouthDakota to Texas that supplies irrigation to an eight-state agricultural region.“The scope of this mounting crisis is difficult to overstate,” wrote BrianBrown. “The High Plains of Texas are swiftly running out of groundwater suppliedby one of the world’s largest aquifers—the Ogallala. A study by Texas TechUniversity has predicted that if groundwater production goes unabated, vastportions of several counties in the southern High Plains will soon have littlewater left in the aquifer to be of any practical value.” The worsening watersituation in California as detailed previously only adds to the problem.With all of these disturbing indicators, Alt-Market.com blogger Brandon Smithbelieves “a second American Revolution is inevitable.”“What frightens the establishment most, I think, is that the American peoplehave become active participants in their own national environment once again[emphasis in the original],” Smith wrote. “At [Nevada rancher Cliven] Bundy[’s]ranch, they stopped asking for mercy, they stopped begging the system to policeitself, they stopped waiting for the rigged elections, and they stopped relyingon useless legal avenues to effect change. Rather, they took matters into theirown hands and changed the situation on the ground on their own. For oligarchy,this development is unacceptable, because one success could lead to many . . .for at least the past four years our government has been quietly maneuveringtoward martial law. It’s been happening for much longer if you count George W.Bush’s Presidential Decision Directive 51, which has yet to be fullydeclassified.” This directive, part of the Continuity of Operations plan,details how the executive branch agencies of the government could take controland maintain federal authority during a declared national emergency. Critics saythe directive gives the president dictatorial powers and eliminates the lastroadblocks to declaring martial law.As in the past, when faced with an increasingly noncompliant citizenry, theglobal elite turns to war as a means of distracting the public, solidifyingpolitical control through patriotism, and damping down social movements while atthe same time increasing the profits of their corporate holdings.While even the globalists are hesitant to provoke another world war, as themassive release of nuclear weapons could spell doom for the entire planet, theyare not above stimulating localized warfare across the world, particularly inthe volatile Middle East.California Internet commentator Richard Scheck noted that facts found in thecorporate mass media reveal that “a Leviathan has emerged at the dawn of the newmillennium reflecting the vision of 1984 and the warning of President Eisenhowerto beware of the military-industrial complex.” He echoed the thoughts of many bycontending that factions within Western intelligence agencies control so-calledterrorist groups and use them to perpetuate a “strategy of tension” and clash ofcivilizations to support partisan political positions.“Psy-op [psychological operations] programs such as Operation Gladio [code namefor a NATO plan to leave behind anticommunist assets in the event of a Sovietinvasion of Europe during the Cold War] and reliance on paramilitary groups tocontinue Cold War efforts designed to defeat world communism which is currentlyreplaced in Orwellian fashion by radical Islam (soon to be followed by China).The public is confused and manipulated by ‘wag the dog’ type events such as OKC[the Oklahoma City bombing], 9/11, Madrid and London. Factions within variousintelligence agencies acting on behalf of vast banking, corporate and criminal(drug) enterprises exploit the rhetoric of radical groups in false-flagoperations designed to terrorize the populace while conveniently shifting blameto the demonized group. This allows cabal members to acquire more power andexpand their domination over all agencies of government by centralizing power(Homeland Security and the new National Intelligence Agency) . . . In this fightfor the future, we are close to a tipping point where a perfect storm of tribal,economic, political, religious and environmental factors will force everyone toawaken to the crisis at hand.“We are all increasingly becoming participants in ‘war of the worlds’ typescenarios as people are impacted by the consequences of peak oil, globalwarming, economic globalization and international terrorism. How we learn tolive with the Leviathan and respond to the difficult tests that lie ahead willdetermine the fate of our children and the shape of the world they inherit.”Scheck recalled the Founding Fathers warning against foreign entanglements.“Those forgetting that are the real traitors to our heritage and have ruinedthis country in their drive for Pax Americana and global hegemony,” he wrote.Up to today, vast numbers of Americans have largely accepted the militaryadventures indulged by Washington because they retained a patriotic trust intheir government. Such trust has succeeded so far in preventing a major societalcollapse. Ever since the issue of federal dominance over the states was decidedin 1865, Americans have been taught to trust their government. Yet this trusthas begun to erode.Professor Henry Giroux is an award-winning professor who taught at universitiesin Boston and Miami and the author of Neoliberalism’s War on Higher Educationand Zombie Politics in the Age of Casino Capitalism, among more than fiftytitles. Giroux questions why so many citizens trust the government to protectthem in the first place. He wonders, “Why should anyone trust a government thathas condoned torture, spied on at least thirty-five world leaders, supportsindefinite detention, places bugs in thousands of computers all over the world,kills innocent people with drone attacks, promotes the post office to log mailfor law enforcement agencies and arbitrarily authorizes targeted assassinations?Or, for that matter, a president that instituted the Insider Threat Program,which was designed to get government employees to spy on each other and ‘turnthemselves and others in for failing to report breaches,’ which includes ‘anyunauthorized disclosure of anything, not just classified materials.’” Some saythis program was designed to turn government employees, such as your postman,into an army of snitches.The Rutherford Institute’s John W. Whitehead, in recalling how the people ofStalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany blindly followed governmentofficials, explained such blind trust in government thusly: “Unfortunately, ‘wethe people’ have become so trusting, so gullible, so easily distracted, soout-of-touch, so compliant and so indoctrinated [to] the idea that ourgovernment will always do the right thing by us that we have ignored the warningsigns all around us, [and not] asking the right questions, demandingsatisfactory answers, and holding our government officials accountable torespecting our rights and abiding by the rule of law has pushed us to the brinkof a nearly intolerable state of affairs . . . at least to those who rememberwhat it was like to live in a place where freedom, due process andrepresentative government actually meant something.”Others ask how one can trust a government that is preparing for internal strife,even a collapse of society. Because it would appear that the United Statesgovernment is doing just that.Beginning in 2008, at the outset of the financial crisis, the Department ofDefense showed concern over the possibility of national collapse by fundinguniversities to initiate studies “to improve DoD’s basic understanding of thesocial, cultural, behavioral, and political forces that shape regions of theworld of strategic importance to the U.S.” This program, entitled the “MinervaResearch Initiative,” basically is designed to predict and prepare for socialcollapse across the globe to include the United States. The Guardian said theprogram was designed “to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points forlarge-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various U.S.military agencies.”The project will determine “the critical mass (tipping point)” of what arecalled “social contagions” by studying their “digital traces” in the cases ofsocial unrest such as “the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Dumaelections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protestsin Turkey.”The titles of projects funded by the initiative avoid words like “collapse,”“rioting,” and “civil war,” preferring to mask this research with such headingsas “Tracking Critical-Mass Outbreaks in Social Contagions,” “Deterrence withProxies,” “Using New Approaches to Measure and Model State Fragility,” “AComputational Assessment of Social Disequilibrium and Security Threats,” and“Understanding the Origin, Characteristics, and Implications of Mass PoliticalMovements.” But the intent of the program is clear—to identify antigovernmentsentiment, pinpoint any activist leaders, and devise ways to suppress governmentdissent. Many of the projects are geared toward foreign nations, particularly inAsia and the third world.In 2014, Congress authorized a total budget of $17.8 million for the MinervaInitiative. However, the final program is expected to cost the taxpayers $75million over a five-year period.Critics of the program include the American Anthropological Association (AAA),which complained that the Pentagon lacks “the kind of infrastructure forevaluating anthropological [and social science] research” in a manner involving“rigorous, balanced and objective peer review.” In a letter to the U.S.government, the AAA stated, “Pentagon officials will have decision-making powerin deciding who sits on the panels” and that “there remain concerns within thediscipline that research will only be funded when it supports the Pentagon’sagenda.”David Price, a professor of cultural anthropology at St Martin’s University inWashington, D.C., is author of Weaponizing Anthropology: Social Science inService of the Militarized State. He has been critical of the Pentagon’s HumanTerrain Systems (HTS) program, which is designed to embed social scientists inmilitary field operations, applying society-altering theories to military“nation building” activities. Price notes the HTS training scenarios adaptcounterinsurgency tactics used in Iraq and Afghanistan for use in the USA,“where the local population is seen from the military perspective as threateningthe established balance of power and influence, and challenging law and order.”Such public studies concern citizens already aroused over the militarization ofpolice and the federal government’s stockpiling of arms and ammunition. Oneparticularly disturbing study in 2013, entitled “Who Does Not Become aTerrorist,” equated peaceful activists with armed militants. Study materialstated, “This project is not about terrorists, but about supporters of politicalviolence.”Guardian reporter Nafeez Ahmed queried Pentagon officials: “Activism, protest,‘political movements’ and of course NGOs are a vital element of a healthy civilsociety and democracy—why is it that the DoD is funding research to investigatesuch issues?” Ahmed said he received no clear answer.Rutherford Institute founder Whitehead questioned the militarization ofgovernment agencies not known for firefights, viewing it as evidence that thefederal government is preparing for a societal collapse. He noted a buildup inrecent years of SWAT teams within non-security-related federal agencies such asDepartment of Agriculture, the Railroad Retirement Board, the Tennessee ValleyAuthority, the Office of Personnel Management, the Consumer Product SafetyCommission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Education Department. Hefurther asked why at least seventy-three federal agencies under the command ofHomeland Security or the Justice Department require approximately 120,000full-time armed officers with arrest authority.“What’s with all of the government agencies stockpiling hollow-point bullets?For example, why does the Department of Agriculture need .40-calibersemiautomatic submachine guns and 320,000 rounds of hollow-point bullets? Forthat matter, why do its agents need ballistic vests and body armor?” Whiteheadasked. “Why does the Postal Service need ‘assorted small arms ammunition’? Whydid the DHS purchase 1.6 billion rounds of hollow-point ammunition, along with7,000 fully automatic 5.56x45mm NATO ‘personal defense weapons’ plus a hugestash of 30-round high-capacity magazines? That’s in addition to the FBI’srequest for 100 million hollow-point rounds. The Department of Education, IRS,the Social Security Administration, and the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, which oversees the National Weather Service, are also among thefederal agencies which have taken to purchasing ammunition and weaponry inbulk.”In mid-2015 a multi-state military exercise called Jade Helm 15 involved notonly special operations units such as the Army’s Green Berets, Navy SEALs, andAir Force Special Ops but also law enforcement agencies. Participants were topractice infiltrating both urban and rural areas to identify and detain citizensthought to be resistant to government demands. The fact that Texas, Utah, andlower California are listed as “hostile states” prompted concerns that theexercise not only violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act restricting the use ofthe military to police U.S. citizens but was a forerunner to martial law.In early June 2014, an incident took place in Houston that might presage acoming collapse in America.When a twenty-three-year-old woman was killed in a traffic accident, bystanderslooted her car of groceries even as her two injured children sat inside it.Police said the woman lost control of her Toyota 4Runner after being clipped byanother car while backing out of a private drive. She hit a tree and waspronounced dead at the scene. Her sons, ages four and six, were in the backseatand were transferred to a hospital with broken bones but no life-threateninginjuries.Witnesses told police they saw people steal groceries out of the dead woman’sSUV. Although it was not clear if the looting took place before or after thewoman’s body and the children were removed from the wreck, it is most probablethat the theft occurred before emergency personnel arrived.One witness told newsmen, “Why would you take somebody’s stuff who got hit by acar? That’s crazy, that’s mean.” But a nearby resident, Savannah Roberts, saidshe was not surprised by the looting. “There is a lot of people you just can’ttrust,” she said. “I’ve seen worse in this area.”What worries some even more than the scarcity of food is the thought that somemultinational corporation—Monsanto comes to mind—might one day have the power toshut down the world’s food supply without notice.Already having been the object of worldwide protests over toxic chemicals suchas Agent Orange, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), and dioxin, many critics arefearful of Monsanto’s reach for control of the world’s food supply through itsproprietary seeds and GMOs. Today, more than 40 percent of all U.S. crop acreageuse Monsanto products and the company owns more than 1,600 patents on seed,plant, and other related commodities.Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit group with fifteen U.S. offices that isdedicated to safe, accessible, and sustainable food and water, produced a paperin 2013 entitled “Monsanto: A Corporate Profile.” According to this paper, inthe United States alone, nearly all (93 percent) of soybeans and four-fifths (80percent) of corn were grown with seeds containing Monsanto GMOs. Monsanto’sleading products include Roundup and Harness herbicides, DeKalb corn seeds,Asgrow soybean seeds, Deltapine cotton seeds, Seminis and De Ruiter vegetableseeds, and insect repellent Smartstax corn and Bollgard cotton.“The company’s power and influence affects not only the U.S. agriculturalindustry, but also political campaigns, regulatory processes and the structureof agriculture systems all over the world,” noted the paper.Supreme Court rulings in 1980 and 2001 have allowed the patenting of livingorganisms, leading to the development of what are termed “Terminator seeds,”crop seeds that will not reproduce the next growing season. What was once afreely exchanged and renewable food source has been privatized and monopolized.“In less than three decades, a handful of multinational corporations haveengineered a fast and furious corporate enclosure of the first link in the foodchain,” stated the Food & Water Watch report.Although Monsanto insists that it would never commercialize Terminator seeds,depriving farmers of new crop seeds or simply producing seeds not engineered toproduce a full crop could cause worldwide famine. Such a dastardly scheme alsowould fit quite nicely with the broader globalist population control agenda. Anycrisis in the food supply could certainly initiate chaos of such magnitude thatthe public would cry out for martial law, especially in the large cities wherehungry mobs of looters could overrun police forces. Most citizens today cannotimagine such a possibility because they are psychologically affected by aphenomenon known as normalcy bias, whereby people fail to recognize orunderestimate the possibility of disaster. Most people tend to believe thatwhatever they experience on a day-to-day basis is “normal” and that things willstay that way. Such bias prevents them from considering the ramifications ofcurrent trends.“As a practical example, most of us suffer under the normalcy bias delusion thatwhen you turn on the faucet in the kitchen, water will always come out,”explains Mike Adams. “We’ve seen this happen so many times that we now take itfor granted and believe it will always happen, almost as if by magic. Eventhough humans living two hundred years ago would have been shocked to see cleanwater coming out of a kitchen faucet, today we are shocked if it doesn’t comeout . . . ! That’s normalcy bias.”Obviously, if the citizens of the death culture hope to survive and flourish inthe future, both their mind-set and behavior must change.CHANGING THE GAMEWHAT CAN CITIZENS DO TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE of privation andtyranny? What can be done on an individual level to make life better, to changethe game? After viewing the egregious missteps of modern American society, whatmight be done to advance ideas and philosophies that could correct pastmistakes? What can engender a more peaceful and prosperous nation?As author Alain de Botton notes, the problem with facts is not that we need moreof them, but that we don’t know what to do with the ones we have. The news mediaspews out an avalanche of facts each day, but what do these facts really mean?“What should be laudable in a news organization is not a simple capacity tocollect facts, but a skill—honed by intelligent bias—at teasing out theirrelevance,” writes de Botton. “We need news organizations to help our curiosityby signaling how their stories fit into the larger themes on which a sincerecapacity for interest depends.” In today’s topsy-turvy America, when consideringwhat needs to be fixed and how, one faces a number of puzzling contradictions.A list of conundrums passed around the Internet in 2014 was repeated bycommentator and a decorated former army lieutenant colonel Allen West in hiswebsite column. Here are six conundrums of socialism that West says “pretty much[sum] up the USA in the twenty-first century”:1. America is said to be capitalist and greedy—yet half of thepopulation is subsidized.2. Half of the population is subsidized—yet they think they arevictims.3. They think they are victims—yet their representatives run thegovernment.4. Their representatives run the government—yet the poor keep gettingpoorer.5. The poor keep getting poorer—yet they have things that people inother countries only dream about.6. They have things that people in other countries only dreamabout—yet they want America to be more like those other countries.West went on to note other contradictions in American society. He pointed outthat Americans are advised to NOT judge ALL Muslims by the actions of a fewlunatics, but we are encouraged to judge ALL gun owners by the actions of a fewlunatics [emphasis in the original].He said it seems we constantly hear about how Social Security is going to runout of money. “How come we never hear about welfare or food stamps running outof money?” asked West. “What’s interesting is the first group worked for theirmoney, but the second didn’t.”Finally, West, a veteran of the conflict in Iraq, pondered, “Why are we cuttingbenefits for our veterans, no pay raises for our military and cutting our armyto a level lower than before WWII, but we are not stopping the payments orbenefits to illegal aliens? Am I the only one missing something?”Maybe, just maybe, the answer rests with smaller government. Change must beginat the local level as the corruption and ambitions in Washington are beyondquick remedy. Initially, there must be changes in both public and privateattitudes toward government, the corporations, and toward each other. New ideasfor the better use of energy, communications, transportation, and health caremust be developed.People in America must understand that while no one can prevent banks fromcollapsing or ensure that a home can be sold for what it originally cost, thereare some measures that can be taken to provide some protection in a chaoticfuture. A good rule of thumb might be “hope for the best but plan for theworst.”If at all possible, move out of the city. Buy farmland with access to water. Afarm with a year-round spring may be worth more than gold in the coming years.Those hoping for security in the U.S. dollar or with savings accounts, stocks,and bonds could lose their shirts in the event of a financial system meltdown.Diversification may be the key to survival. This may be the time to trade inpaper dollars for real assets such as land, tractors, medical supplies, preciousmetals, ammo, food, and so on.One California family has provided an example of what can be accomplished bychanging priorities. At a time when the federal government is run bymultinational corporations and the general public is zombified by processed foodand TV, this family has worked to become largely self-sufficient by transforminga small backyard garden into a productive microfarm.Jules Dervaes, along with his son Justin, and his two daughters, Anais andJordanne, live in a 1,500-square-foot-bungalow on one-fifth of an acre on theedge of Los Angeles. In their small garden, they grow 350 different vegetables,herbs, fruits, and berries. The sustainable plot is complete with chickens,ducks, rabbits, goats, and honey bees. For two years in a row they were able toproduce six thousand pounds of food. Hailed as one of the most independentfamily units in the country, the Dervaeses have progressively reduced theirenvironmental impact and provided a sterling model for living sustainably andsimply in an urban setting.Ninety percent of their vegetarian diet comes from the homestead and two-thirdsof their energy is solar. Biodiesel fuel is made from used vegetable oil. Theirradio operates by a hand crank. While they consume most of the food theyproduce, the Dervaeses sell any excess to local individuals and businesses.Profits are used to purchase basics like flour and rice. Dervaes says his familyhas demonstrated how individuals need not rely on a centralized authoritariansystem to live a productive and rewarding life. “Government can’t do it andcorporations won’t do it,” he explains, adding with some humor that his familyis “in danger of being free.”More and more people are joining the Dervaes family and breaking with the statusquo of America. They are moving out of congested cities and buying small farms,returning to the land to raise their families and their own healthy food. Thosewho cannot leave the city are becoming self-sufficient by cultivating backyardgardens.Still others are shopping at farmers markets and turning to organic products inan effort to avoid the deficiencies of processed, mass-produced food. Societycannot long survive when food is no longer nutritious or when it containspoisonous substances. Supporting local markets not only helps struggling farmersbut guarantees a healthy diet. In many areas food cooperatives are providingnutritious foods to members. If no food co-op is near you, form one by makingcontact with producers in your area.As the Boy Scout motto states, “Be prepared.” This does not mean that everyoneshould become a survivalist with massive stockpiles of food, water, andammunition. It only means that any prudent person should hope for the best butprepare for the worst.Even the federal government, in the form of the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA), recommends that every family have a Basic Emergency Kit, alsoknown as a bug-out bag. The FEMA website encourages everyone to be prepared foran emergency situation. “You may need to survive on your own after anemergency,” acknowledges the site. “This means having your own food, water andother supplies in sufficient quantity to last for at least 72 hours. Localofficials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster but theycannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in hours or it might takedays. Additionally, basic services such as electricity, gas, water, sewagetreatment and telephones may be cut off for days or even a week, or longer. Yoursupplies kit should contain items to help you manage during these outages.”FEMA recommends accumulating the following basic supplies:• Water, one gallon of water per person per day, for drinking andsanitation• Food, at least a three-day supply of nonperishable food• Battery-powered radio and a NOAA weather radio with tone alert, andextra batteries for both• Flashlight and extra batteries• First-aid kit• Whistle to signal for help• Infant formula and diapers, if you have an infant• Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties for personalsanitation• Dust mask or cotton T-shirt, to help filter the air• Plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter-in-place• Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities• Can opener for food (if kit contains canned food)FEMA also advises citizens in cold-weather climates to prepare for lowtemperatures with sleeping bags, coats, and other warm clothing.Over and above basic survival preparation, thoughtful people should plan for asituation in which medical services are either overcrowded or simplyunavailable.Instruction books on first aid and home and herbal remedies should be kept onhand. If a family member requires prescription medicine, a supply should be keptin reserve. Citizens must be prepared to take responsibility for themselves andtheir family rather than count on help from the medical and pharmaceuticalestablishments.For those desiring to take control over their own health, the websitenaturalcuresnotmedicine.com points out that today there exists an “almostlimitless library, open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to anyonewith a passion for reading! Never has so much free material been available.”Today, there are more than a hundred websites filled with a wide variety ofe-books, ranging from literary classics to how-to instructions.Robert David Steele, a former deputy director of Marine intelligence and CIAcase officer, advocates open-source intelligence, that is, information derivedfrom public sources. Steele founded the Open Source Solutions Network Inc. andlater the nonprofit Earth Intelligence Network, which supports the PublicIntelligence Blog. Americans today, according to Steele, are lacking in publicintelligence, in knowing what one needs to know in order to make honestdecisions for the good of all rather than corrupt decisions for the good of thefew due to distraction and misdirection by the corporate mass media.Steele, in the spirit of the “Be Prepared” says, “I’m a former spy and I believewe still need spies and secrecy, but we need to redirect the vast majority ofthe funds now spent on secrecy toward savings and narrowly focused endeavors athome . . . Believe it or not, 95 percent of what we need for ethicalevidence-based decision support cannot be obtained through the secret methods ofstandard intelligence practices. But it can be obtained quite openly and cheaplyfrom academics, civil society, commerce, governments, law enforcementorganizations, the media, all militaries, and non-governmental organizations. AnOpen Source Agency, as I’ve proposed it, would not just meet 95 percent of ourintelligence requirements, it would do the same at all levels of government andcarry over by enriching education, commerce, and research—it would create what Icalled in 1995 a ‘Smart Nation.’”According to Steele, most of our problems today can be traced to unilateralmilitarism, virtual colonialism, and predatory capitalism, all based on forceand lies and encroachment on the common good. “The national security state worksfor the City of London and Wall Street—both are about to be toppled by acombination of Eastern alternative banking and alternative internationaldevelopment capabilities, and individuals who recognize that they have the powerto pull their money out of the banks and not buy the consumer goods thatsubsidize corruption and the concentration of wealth. The opportunity to takeback the commons for the benefit of humanity as a whole is open—here and now.”Just such a move may have begun in 2015 when fifty-seven nations joined theChina-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) over the objections of theU.S. government. The AIIB was expected to compete with the Anglo American–runWorld Bank and International Monetary Fund.Noting that during the past few decades, populations who had spent centuriesevolving away from slavery were reduced to marketable commodities by theindustrial era. In his 2012 book, The Open Source Everything Manifesto, Steelesaid communities must reject “concentrated illicitly aggregated and largelyphantom wealth in favor of community wealth defined by community knowledge,community sharing of information, and community definition of truth derived intransparency and authenticity, the latter being the ultimate arbiter of sharedwealth.”Steele joined many others today in calling for an end to national diktat andinstead the emergence of bottom-up clarity, diversity, integrity, andsustainability. Across America, a growing number of citizens feels the federalgovernment is out of control. True freedom and liberty must begin withindividuals at the local level. “Individual towns across the USA are nownullifying federal and state regulations—for example gag laws on animal cruelty,blanket permissions for fracking,” noted Steele. “Top-down power has failed in amost spectacular manner, and bottom-up consensus power is emergent. ‘Not in myneighborhood’ is beginning to trump ‘Because I say so.’ The one unlimitedresource we have on the planet is the human brain—the current strategy of onepercent capitalism is failing because it is killing the Golden Goose at multiplelevels. Unfortunately, the gap between those with money and power and those whoactually know what they are talking about has grown catastrophic. The rich aresurrounded by sycophants and pretenders whose continued employment demands thatthey not question the premises.”Another thing individuals can do is communicate with local news media. Let themknow when they do something good for the community and, more importantly, letthem know when you are displeased with the coverage, or lack thereof, of a newsevent. Send them important news items from the alternative media and ask whythey are not covering such important topics. Hold them to their word when theyboast they have the best news coverage in town.Write letters to your political representatives, who are always concerned aboutgetting your vote. One or two letters may not sway a politician beholden tocorporate contributions, but an avalanche of letters and calls can often make adifference in their voting record.In politics, it is a sad but unalterable fact that no one can get elected tooffice without telling lies. In America today it appears no one can be electedat the national level by telling the truth, as witnessed by the failed campaignsof Ron Paul and Ross Perot. So the intelligent voter must disregard what anyoffice seeker may say. Merely watch what they do, how they vote. If they vote toyour satisfaction, then vote them back into office. If not, vote them out andtry someone new, regardless of party politics. This is not a revolutionary idea,it is the way the system is supposed to work.America must move away from the political party system. Political ideologieshave exerted a devolutionary influence on us. As Internet blogger Paul Rosenbergexplains, “They make us harsher, angrier, easier to manipulate, and almostimpossible to reason with. In almost every way that can be examined, they’re badfor us,” he wrote. “The great problem is that people think they’re required tohave political stances. This is a tremendously damaging and false belief, butthe Western world is currently addicted to it. In our time, Politics isAlmighty. The truth, however, is that we are more than capable of examining theworld and coming to conclusions without the mental partnership of a politicalideology.” In other words, a free and thinking person should not have to declarehim or herself a Democrat or a Republican when expressing political opinions. Infact, more and more people are realizing that the two parties are simply twowings of America’s one and only political entity—the War Party.Both Democrats and Republicans, which have now split into the more correctlabels of liberals and conservatives, allow heated debates over topics such assame-sex marriage, abortion, and gun control. But when it comes to foreignpolicy and particularly issues involving the corporations, the banks, or themilitary, there is no difference between the two parties.Rosenberg noted that once the political process is completed and laws arepassed, people have a binary choice: either obey or be punished. “At the end ofevery political process are armed men, violently enforcing it. That’s barbaric,and it’s ugly,” he noted. “The truth is that we really don’t need thoseembittering ideologies. And if we ever really did need them, we’ve outgrownthem. As best I can see it, the truth is that political ideologies make peopleconsistently barbaric and ugly. They make them worse. Our lives would beimproved if we dropped them.” For a clear illustration of how a publicnonviolent revolution might succeed, one need only look at the tiny islandnation of Iceland. Since 2008, the corporate mass media in America has providedlavish coverage of the American financial meltdown, the “Arab Springs” in Egyptand Syria, the “Occupy” movement, and the Sunday-morning talking heads go on andon about secretive organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and theCouncil on Foreign Affairs preaching financial austerity. But rarely mentionedare events in Iceland, which may provide a blueprint to regaining popularcontrol over a government and financial system.When the financial meltdown of 2008 began, the primary banks in Iceland werenationalized and it was decided not to pay the debts created by Great Britainand Holland’s questionable policies. In two separate referendums, Icelandiccitizens voted that Iceland should not have to repay foreign creditors the moneythey lost when Icelandic banks defaulted. Elections were held and the entiregovernment was replaced. The new regime proposed to repay the debts over aperiod of fifteen years at the low interest rate of 5.5 percent. In 2010, afterpublic demonstrations, the government initiated an investigation and manyhigh-level bankers and executives were arrested for their part in the financialcrisis. Many soon left the country. A new constitution based on the DanishConstitution was written and a constitutional assembly called, composed ofcandidates whose only qualifications were that they were adults and had thesupport of thirty persons.Many notable economists hailed the move. Columbia University economics professorand Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz wrote, “Iceland did the right thing bymaking sure its payment systems continued to function while creditors, not thetaxpayers, shouldered the losses of banks.”Paul Krugman of the New York Times agreed, writing, “In a nutshell, Ireland hasbeen orthodox and responsible—guaranteeing all debts, engaging in savageausterity to try to pay for the cost of those guarantees, and, of course,staying on the euro. Iceland has been heterodox: capital controls, largedevaluation, and a lot of debt restructuring—notice that wonderful line from theIMF, above, about how ‘private sector bankruptcies have led to a marked declinein external debt.’ Bankrupting yourself to recovery! Seriously. And guess what:heterodoxy is working a whole lot better than orthodoxy.”Today, despite some setbacks, Iceland’s economy appears strong and unemploymentis much lower than it is in Ireland, Greece, or Portugal. Iceland’s ordealexemplifies the conundrum facing America—you can have the privatization of banksand other businesses and risk corruption and monopolies, or you can havecentralized government control that also might not work for the benefit of thepublic. Yet questions remain as to why the Iceland experience was not widely orclearly presented in the corporate mass media. A contributor to CNN’s iReportasked, “Have we been informed of this through the media? Has any politicalprogram in radio or TV commented on this? No! The Icelandic people have beenable to show that there is a way to beat the system and have given a democracylesson to the world.”One basic problem in America is that more people are voting for a living thanworking for a living. One 2010 study showed that 60 percent of Americans werereceiving more in government benefits than they paid in taxes. This number, ofcourse, includes government pensions, Social Security, and Medicare paymentsthat come from contributions made during a person’s lifetime and are correctlytermed entitlements. These people earned this money. Yet according to the U.S.Department of Commerce, almost 47 million Americans received food stamps, thoughactually most now receive government-issued debit cards called ElectronicBenefit Transfers (EBTs), and another 5.6 million receive unemploymentinsurance.According to U.S. Census Bureau statistics released in mid-2014, almost 110million Americans—more than one-third of the total population—were living onsome form of government assistance. This number included more than 51 millionreceiving food stamps and 83 million collecting Medicaid, with some collectingfrom more than one program, and does not reflect the more than 5 million personsreceiving government retirement benefits.Consider that this same census bureau reported that the number of full-timeprivate-sector workers, in other words, those American who got up and went to ajob every morning, numbered only 86.4 million. Of a total of 103 millionfull-time, year-round workers, almost 17 million work for the government. Thisincludes 12.5 million who worked for state and local governments and 4 millionfederal employees, all of whom are paid by tax money from the public treasury.Is doesn’t take a math whiz to realize that a nation with only 86 millionfull-time private-sector workers cannot sustain 110 million living offgovernment benefits. A collapse appears imminent.Such statistics support the words of the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville,who, after traveling in the U.S. in the early 1800s, wrote, “The AmericanRepublic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe thepublic with the public’s money.”Anyone who has ever done his own taxes realizes that he cannot pay out moremoney than he has received for very long. This is why a growing number ofcitizens believe that people receiving government subsistence—other thanentitlements earned by years of work—should not be able to vote. They see thisas a clear conflict of interest, as a welfare recipient’s vote will always go towhoever promises them the most from public funds. Some welfare critics believean application for government benefits should be a voluntary renunciation of theright to vote.Alfred W. Evans, in a November 18, 2010, letter to the editor of the Waco[Texas] Tribune-Herald reflected the views of many who wish to change thecurrent American system when he wrote: “Put me in charge of food stamps. I’d getrid of Lone Star cards; no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho’s, just money forfifty-pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese and all the powdered milkyou can haul away. If you want steak and frozen pizza, then get a job.“Put me in charge of Medicaid. The first thing I’d do is to get women Norplantbirth control implants or tubal ligations. Then we’ll test recipients for drugs,alcohol, and nicotine and document all tattoos and piercings. If you want toreproduce [and] use drugs, alcohol, smoke, or get tats and piercings, then get ajob.“Put me in charge of government housing. Ever live in a military barracks? Youwill maintain your property in a clean and good state of repair. Your ‘home’will be subject to inspections anytime and possessions will be inventoried. Ifyou want a plasma TV or an Xbox 360, then get a job and your own place.“In addition, you will either present a check stub from a job each week or youwill report to a ‘government’ job. It may be cleaning the roadways of trash,painting and repairing public housing, whatever we find for you. We will sellyour twenty-two-inch rims and low-profile tires and your blasting stereo andspeakers and put that money toward the ‘common good.’“Before you write that I’ve violated someone’s rights, realize that all of theabove is voluntary. If you want our money, accept our rules. Before you say thatthis would be ‘demeaning’ and ruin their ‘self-esteem,’ consider that it wasn’tthat long ago that taking someone else’s money for doing absolutely nothing wasdemeaning and lowered self-esteem.“If we are expected to pay for other people’s mistakes we should at leastattempt to make them learn from their bad choices. The current system rewardsthem for continuing to make bad choices.”The biggest roadblock to making positive changes in America comes from the factthat such changes will require a change of laws, which, in turn, meanscongressional action.Yet this comes at a time when polls show the lowest public opinion of that bodyas a consequence of the polarization of the political parties. No nationallawmaker seems capable of solving public issues through rational, thoughtfuldebate and compromise.All national politicians can talk about today is democracy . . . we have todefend democracy, save democracy, and bring democracy to people in foreignlands. Citizens fail to understand that the definition of democracy is simplyrule by the majority, and the clearest example of democracy in action is a lynchmob. The Founding Fathers did not leave us a pure democracy; they created ademocratic republic ruled by laws and checks and balances.Only after a fair trial—complete with legal representation, a jury of peers, andthe opportunity to challenge the witnesses and evidence offered by theprosecution—can a defendant be found guilty and lynched.The wealthy elite today constantly extol the benefits of democracy and majorityrule, because they easily manage the masses by their ownership of a mere handfulof transnational media corporations. A few critics are allowed to hostalternative talk shows and websites to give the impression of First Amendmentfreedom. The globalists don’t mind, for they still control the masses throughownership of the corporate media, and, after all, majority rules. And fewrealize that the media control and the polarization taking place today has beenthe conscious agenda of the globalists, who consider the United States as anot-so-profitable branch of the world economy they seek to control.It is time for each thoughtful and concerned citizen to apply his or her owntalents to solving the problems of America. It is too late to correct the abusesand excesses of the federal government, especially considering the problematicuse of computer voting machines, which have proven to be so susceptible tohacking and manipulation and the increasing control of Congress by corporationsand special interests.So any meaningful change must begin at the personal level and work upwardthrough local governments. With the help of neighbors and like-minded citizens,local city councils, county commissioners, and school boards should be packedwith persons both aware of and concerned with the issues involved in serving andprotecting the general public. Local leaders answerable to the community couldturn the tide of an overreaching corporate-controlled federal bureaucracy andbetter manage local services.The primary point is that each individual must begin to take personalresponsibility for himself and his family. Robert David Steele reminds us thatthere is a wealth of open-source material to guide the individual truly seekingknowledge in whatever field, whether it is how to start a business or how toraise chickens. The time for trusting a corporate-run government to take care ofevery need has passed.A 2014 Pennsylvania case is one example of successful prevention of overreachfrom government bureaucrats. In that case, Sheriff Carl Nace refused to handover the names and addresses of concealed-weapon carriers to three countyauditors who claimed they needed them to properly audit the sheriff’s office.Nace said such a request was unwarranted for audit needs and conflicted with astatute making it a felony to disclose the names. The auditors sued the sheriff,but the judge sided with Sheriff Nace and dismissed the lawsuit. The OathKeepers organization, the Perry County Commissioners, the Pennsylvania SheriffsAssociation, the Prince Law Firm, and a large number of Pennsylvania residentssupported Sheriff Nace.“Sheriffs have a unique role in law enforcement. Unlike their counterpart, thepolice chief, they are elected by the people. That fact makes them accountableto the people [emphasis in the original]. It forms a special bond of trustbetween the sheriff and his constituents,” notes Robert Hase with Elias Alias onthe Oath Keepers website. “Sheriff Nace has decided to do what is right. He ishonoring his oath to the people as required by the Constitution.”Andrew Martin, editor of Oneness Publishing and author of the 2011 book One—ASurvival Guide for the Future, noted, “For the most part we live in a state ofseparation, we create thoughts and scenarios in our minds that do not representreality. We create these realities that go toward deluding ourselves. In thisworld of constant struggle, we suffer, causing ourselves pain, frustration andisolation. To live free and enlightened is to release ourselves from theseself-inflicted negative states of mind. We are free to do this at any time wechoose, it is merely a matter of choice.”Unlike Sheriff Nace, most people feel impotent to stand against thetotalitarianism of big government and the police state. “I’m only one person,what can I do about all this?” is a common refrain. Taking charge of one’s ownpower and destiny may seem like a daunting challenge, but recent scientificbreakthroughs support the idea that each individual has more capacity to changeher reality than has been conditioned into her by education and religiousauthorities.Today, it is becoming known that individuals can effect change within themselvesby altering their thinking and emotions. Human DNA can be reprogrammed throughwords and emotions without cutting and replacing genes. Apparently, human DNA isa biological Internet and superior in many aspects to the artificial one,according to German authors Grazyna Fosar and Franz Bludorf, writing on the WakeUp World website. “Recent research directly or indirectly claims to explainphenomena such as clairvoyance, intuition, spontaneous and remote acts ofhealing, self-healing, affirmation techniques, unusual light (auras) aroundpeople, the mind’s influence on weather patterns and much more,” they wrote.“Esoteric and spiritual teachers have known for ages that our body isprogrammable by language, words and thought. This has now been scientificallyproven and explained,” wrote Fosar and Bludorf.Today, more and more children are being born with access to such DNAconsciousness. They exhibit telepathic and clairvoyant abilities and develop agroup consciousness. “Researchers think that if humans with full individualitywould regain group consciousness, they would have a god-like power to create,alter and shape things on Earth! And humanity is collectively moving toward sucha group consciousness of the new kind,” wrote Fosar and Bludorf.The belief that humans can alter their emotions and physical body through sheerwillpower was also supported by the book The Biology of Belief: Unleashing thePower of Consciousness, Matter, and Miracles by former medical school professorand research scientist Dr. Bruce H. Lipton. Termed “groundbreaking” by critics,Lipton’s book demonstrates how human cells receive and process information. Thework of Lipton and other scientists shows that human DNA is controlled notthrough biology but through energetic signals from outside the cell, including aperson’s negative and positive thoughts. This means the physical body can bealtered by changing the person’s thoughts and emotions.This is where science and spirituality begin to blend. According to Dr. AndrewNewberg, a professor of radiology, psychology, and religious studies at theUniversity of Pennsylvania and cofounder of its Center for Spirituality and theMind, “A large body of science shows a positive impact of religion on health.The way the brain works is so compatible with religion and spirituality thatwe’re going to be enmeshed in both for a long time.”But such advances in thought, perception, and the ability to alter perceptionsleading to alterations in one’s physiology must be based on truth.Those who follow the teaching of the Bible should notice that no fewer thanthree times in the New Testament, Jesus tells his disciples that all sins may beforgiven, even blasphemy against him (Matthew 12:31–31; Mark 3:28–29; Luke12:10), but the one sin that can never be forgiven is blasphemy against the HolySpirit.The definition of the Holy Spirit is found in John 15:26 (Living Bible): “But Iwill send you the Comforter—the Holy Spirit, the source of all truth.”The solution to most of the world’s problems may be found in the spirit oftruth.Truth is eternal. The whole universe is truth. It simply exists. Galaxies, suns,and planets just exist. Animals can love or hate but they cannot practicedeceit. Only humanity, with our freewill, can choose to be deceitful. Onlyhumans can speak untruths when they know better. So to speak against the HolySpirit is to distort, deform, or deny truth.This should be seriously considered by those religious fundamentalists who haveallowed truth to be distorted and misused in America, who have blindly followedtheir leaders into a society geared toward war, death, and debilitation.Since the Vietnam War, with government promises of “light at the end of thetunnel,” to the Bush administration’s warning that Saddam Hussein was withinweeks of striking with “weapons of mass destruction,” the American public hasbeen pushed from pillar to post by government lies, half-truths, anddemagoguery.In 2014, President Barack Obama declared success in Iraq by withdrawing U.S.troops, only to send soldiers back midyear to protect American personnel asradical Sunni jihadist insurgents of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria(al-Sham) (ISIS) overran many key areas. A June 2014 Gallup poll indicated thatthe majority of respondents viewed Obama’s decision to send three hundredSpecial Forces advisers to Iraq as only a preliminary step in sending largernumbers of troops back to that strife-ridden country.The mid-2014 poll, which gave Obama a six-year-low approval rating on foreignpolicy, showed that while most respondents thought the insurgents would conquerIraq if the U.S. didn’t return, a majority indicated they thought it moreimportant to keep our troops out of Iraq than to stop the fighting. But, aswitnessed by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was presaged by some of thelargest antiwar demonstrations ever recorded, the will of the majority doesn’tseem to alter decisions made by the corporate globalists that run the AmericanEmpire.A feeling of impotence and cynicism in the face of globalist control wasreflected in a mid-2014 Gallup poll, which gauged Americans’ eroding confidencein their leaders. Public confidence in all three branches of the federalgovernment had fallen to record lows. Only 29 percent expressed confidence inthe presidency, down 7 percent from a previous rating of 36 percent. Discontentwas also registered for the other two branches of government, with the SupremeCourt gathering a 30 percent approval rating, while Congress remained in thesingle-digit column with only 7 percent expressing confidence in thatinstitution.The failures of centralized government aside, many feel it is long past time forthe American people to cast off the blinders imposed on them by the corporatemass media and view the reality of their death-dealing society, to truly movetoward a future that values life over death. Be warned, this could lead to a newand shocking worldview, as many may learn that the much-discussed “New WorldOrder” is simply the Old World Order. The means of exercising power are thesame; only the technologies have changed. The caesars and kings of yesterdaybecame the Robber Barons of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, who in turnhave become the corporate owners of today. These self-styled globalists believethemselves to be more enlightened, entitled by heritage, and therefore, moreworthy than others to rule the world.And through their ownership of the multinational corporations that controlgovernments and even our food, water, and pharmaceuticals, they are drawingimmense profits even as they poison and sicken whole populations in theirpursuit of depopulation.The globalist-instigated American culture of death must be turned into a cultureof life."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [nav.xhtml#r_idParaDest-48]THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE INNUMERABLE persons—authors,bloggers, journalists, talk show hosts, whistle-blowers, demonstrators, andactivists—who have researched and addressed the insidious inroads into modernlife made by the wealthy elite globalists.
