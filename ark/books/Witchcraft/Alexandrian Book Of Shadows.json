The Law was made for the Wicca, to advise and help in their troubles. 2. The Wicca should give due worship to the gods and obey their will, which they ordain, for it was made for the good of Wicca as the worship of the Wicca is good for the gods. For the gods love the brethren of Wicca. 3. As a man loveth a woman by mastering her, 4. So should the Wicca love the gods by being mastered by them. 5. And it is necessary that the Circle which is the temple of the gods, should be truly cast and purified. And that it may be a fit place for the gods to enter. 6. And the Wicca shall be properly prepared and purified to enter into the presence of the gods. 7. With love and worship in their hearts, they shall raise power from their bodies to give power to the gods. 8. As has been taught of old. 9. For in this way only may men have communion with the gods, for the gods cannot help man without the help of man. 10. HPS & HP And the High Priestess shall rule her coven as the representative of the Goddess. 11. And the High Priest shall support her as the representative of the God. 12. And the High Priestess shall choose whom she will, be he of sufficient rank, to be her High Priest. 13. For, as the God Himself kissed Her feet in the five-fold salute, laying His power at the feet of the Goddess because of Her youth and beauty, Her sweetness and kindness, Her wisdom and justice, Her humility and generosity, 14. So He resigned all His power to Her. 15. But the High Priestess should ever mind that the power comes from Him. 16. It is only lent, to be used wisely and justly. 17. And the greatest virtue of a High Priestess be that she recognize that youth is necessary to the representative of the Goddess. 18. So she will gracefully retire in favour of a younger woman should the Coven so decide in council. 19. For a true High Priestess realizes that gracefully surrendering pride of place is one of the greatest virtues. 20. And that thereby she will return to that pride of place in another life, with greater power and beauty. 21."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" SECURITY In the old days, when witchdom extended far, we were free and worshipped in all the greater temples. 22. But in these unhappy times we must celebrate our sacred mysteries in secret. 23. So be it ordained that none but the Wicca may see our mysteries, for our enemies are many and torture loosens the tongue of man. 24. So be it ordained that no Coven shall know where the next Coven bide. 25. Or who its members be, save only the Priest and Priestess and messenger. 26. And there shall be no communication between them, save by the messenger of the gods, or the summoner. 27. And only if it be safe may the Covens meet in some safe place for the great festivals. 28. And while there, none shall say whence they came nor give their true names. 29. To this end, that if any be tortured, in their agony, they may not tell if they do not know. 30. So be it ordained that no one shall tell anyone not of the craft who be of the Wicca, nor give any names or where they bide, or in any way tell anything which can betray any of us to our foes. 31. Nor may he tell where the Covendom be. 32. Or the Covenstead. 33. Or where the meetings be. 34. And if any break these Laws, even under torture, THE CURSE OF THE GODDESS SHALL BE UPON THEM , so they may never be reborn on earth and may remain where they belong, in the hell of the Christians. 35. DISPUTES Let each High Priestess govern her Coven with justice and love, with the help and advice of the High Priest and the Elders, always heeding the advice of the Messenger of the Gods if he cometh. 36. She will heed all complaints of all Brothers and strive to settle all differences among them. 37. But it must be recognized that there will always be people who will ever strive to force others to do as they will. 38. These are not necessarily evil. 39. And they oft have good ideas and such ideas should be talked over in council. 40. But if they will not agree with their Brothers, or if they say, 41. \"I will not work under this High Priestess,\" 42. It hath ever been the Old Law to be convenient to the Brethren and to avoid disputes. 43. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"NEW COVENS Any of the third may claim to found a new Coven because they live over a league away from the Covenstead or are about to do so. 44. Anyone living within the Covendom and wishing to form a new Coven, shall tell the Elders of their intention, and on the instant avoid their dwelling and remove to the new Covendom. 45. Members of the old Coven may join the new one when it is formed. But if they do, they must utterly avoid the old Coven. 46. The Elders of the new and old Covens should meet in peace and brotherly love to decide the new boundaries. 47. Those of the craft who dwell outside both Covendoms may join either but not both. 48. Though all may, if the Elders agree, meet for the great festivals if it be truly in peace and brotherly love, 49. But splitting the Coven oft means strife, so for this reason these Laws were made of old and may the CURSE OF THE GODDESS BE ON ANY WHO DISREGARD THEM . So be it ordained. 50. GRIMOIRE If you would keep a book, let it be in your own hand of write. Let brothers and sisters copy what they will, but never let the book out of your hands, and never keep the writings of another. 51. For if it be found in their hand of write, they may be taken and arraigned. 52. Let each guard his own writings and destroy them whenever danger threatens. 53. Learn as much as you may by heart and, when danger is past, rewrite your book, an it be safe. 54. For this reason, if any die, destroy their book an they have not been able to. 55. For, an it be found, 'tis clear proof against them. 56. And our oppressors know well \"Ye may not be a witch alone\". 57. So all their kin and friends be in danger of torture, 58. So destroy everything not necessary. 59. If your book be found on you, 'tis clear proof against you alone, you may be arraigned. 60. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PERSECUTION Keep all thoughts of the craft from your mind. 61. If the torture be too great to bear, say \"I will confess. I cannot bear this torture. What do you want me to say?\" 62. If they try to make you speak of the Brotherhood, do not. 63. But if they try to make you speak of impossibilities such as flying through the air, consorting with a Christian devil or sacrificing children, or eating men's flesh, 64. To obtain relief from torture say \"I had an evil dream, I was beside myself, I was crazed.\" 65. Not all magistrates are bad, if there be an excuse, they may show mercy. 66. If you have confessed aught, deny it afterwards, say you babbled under torture, say you knew not what you said. 67. If you are condemned, fear not. 68. The Brotherhood is powerful and will help you to escape if you stand steadfast, but if you betray aught there is no hope for you in this life or in that to come. 69. Be sure, if steadfast you go to the pyre, drugs will reach you, you will feel naught. You go to death and what lies beyond, the ecstasy of the goddess. 70. TOOLS To avoid discovery, let the working tools be as ordinary things that any may have in their houses. 71. Let the pentacles be of wax so that they may be broken at once or melted. 72. Have no sword unless your rank allows it. 73. Have no names or signs on anything. 74. Write the names and signs on them in ink before consecrating them and wash it off immediately afterwards. 75. Let the colours of the hilts tell which is which. 76. Do not engrave them lest they cause discovery. 77. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CONDUCT Ever remember ye are the hidden children of the Goddess so never do anything to disgrace them or Her. 78. Never boast, never threaten, never say you would wish ill of anyone. 79. If any person not in the Circle, speak of the craft, say, \"Speak not to me of such, it frightens me, 'tis evil luck to speak of it.\" 80. For this reason, the Christians have their spies everywhere. These speak as if they were well affected to us, as if they would come to our meetings, saying, \"My mother used to worship the Old Ones. I would I could go myself.\" 81. To such as these, ever deny all knowledge. 82. But to others, ever say, \"'Tis foolish men talk of witches flying through the air. To do so they must be as light as thistledown. And men say that witches all be blear-eyed old crones, so what pleasure can there be at a witch meeting such as folks talk on ?\" 83. And say, \"Many wise men now say there be no such creatures.\" 84. Ever make it jest) and in some future time perhaps, the persecution may die and we may worship our gods in safety again. 85. Let us all pray for that happy day. 86. May the blessings of the Goddess and God be on all who keep these Laws which are ordained. 87. VALUABLES If the craft hath any appanage, let all guard it and help to keep it clear and good for the craft. 88. And let all justly guard all monies of the craft. 89. And if any Brother truly wrought it, 'tis right they have their pay, an it be just. An this be not taking money for the art, but for good and honest work. 90. And even the Christians say, \"The labourer is worthy of his hire,\" but if any Brother work willingly for the good of the craft without pay, 'tis but to their greater honour. So be it ordained. 91. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"QUARRELS If there be any dispute or quarrel among the Brethren, the High Priestess shall straightly convene the Elders and inquire into the matter, and they shall hear both sides, first alone and then together. 92. And they shall decide justly, not favouring one side or the other. 93. Ever recognising there be people who can never agree to work under others. 94. But at the same time, there be some people who cannot rule justly. 95. To those who must ever be chief, there is one answer. 96. \"'Void the Coven or seek another one, or make a Coven of your own, taking with you those who will go.\" 97. To those who cannot rule justly, the answer be, \"Those who cannot bear your rule will leave you.\" 98. For none may come to meetings with those with whom they are at variance. 99. So, an either cannot agree, get hence, for the craft must ever survive. So be it ordained. 100. CURSES In the olden days when we had power, we could use the art against any who ill-treated the Brotherhood. But in these evil days we must not do so. For our enemies have devised a burning pit of everlasting fire into which they say their god casteth all the people who worship him, except it be the very few who are released by their priest's spells and masses. And this be chiefly by giving monies and rich gifts to receive his favour for their great god is ever in need of money. 101. But as our gods need our aid to make fertility for man and crops, so is the god of the Christians ever in need of man's help to search out and destroy us. Their priests ever tell them that any who get our help are damned to this hell forever, so men be mad with the terror of it. 102. But they make men believe that they may escape this hell if they give victims to the tormentors. So for this reason all be forever spying, thinking, \"An I can catch but one of these Wicca, I will escape from this fiery pit.\" 103. So for this reason we have our hidels, and men searching long and not finding, say, \"There be none, or if there be, they be in a far country.\" 104. But when one of our oppressors die, or even be sick, ever is the cry, \"This be witches' malice\", and the hunt is up again. And though they slay ten of their own to one of ours, still they care not. They have countless thousands. 105. While we are few indeed. So be it ordained. 106. That none shall use the art in any way to do ill to any. 107. However much they may injure us, harm none. And nowtimes many believe we exist not. 108. That this Law shall ever continue to help us in our plight, no one, however great an injury or injustice they receive, may use the art in any way to do ill, or harm any. But they may, after great consultations with all, use the art to restrain Christians from harming us Brothers, but only to constrain them and never to punish. 109. To this end men will say, \"Such a one is a mighty searcher out, and a persecutor of old women 110."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"whom they deemeth to be witches, and none hath done him harm, so it be proof that they cannot or more truly there be none.\" For all know full well that so many folk have died because someone had a grudge against them, or were persecuted because they had money or goods to sieze, or because they had none to bribe the searchers. And many have died because they were scolding old women. So much that men now say that only old women are witches. 111. And this be to our advantage and turns suspicion away from us. 112. In England and Scotland 'tis now many a year since a witch hath died the death. But any misuse of the power might raise the persecution again. 113. So never break this Law, however much you are tempted, and never consent to its being broken in the least. 114. If you know it is being broken, you must work strongly against it. 115. And any High Priestess or High Priest who consents to its breach must immediately be deposed for 'tis the blood of the Brethren they endanger. 116. Do good, an it be safe, and only if it be safe. 117. And keep strictly to the Old Law. 118. PAYMENT Never accept money for the use of the art, for money ever smeareth the taker. 'Tis sorcerors and conjurers and the priests of the Christians who ever accept money for the use of their arts. And they sell pardons to let men ascape from their sins. 119. Be not as these. If you accept no money, you will be free from temptation to use the art for evil causes. 120. All may use the art for their own advantage or for the advantage of the craft only if you are sure you harm none. 121. But ever let the Coven debate this at length. Only if all are satisfied that none may be harmed, may the art be used. 122. If it is not possible to achieve your ends one way, perchance the aim may be achieved by acting in a different way so as to harm none. MAY THE CURSE OF THE GODDESS BE ON ANY WHO BREAKETH THIS LAW . So be it ordained. 123. 'Tis judged lawful if ever any of the craft need a house or land and none will sell, to incline the owner's mind so as to be willing to sell, provided it harmeth him not in any way and the full price is paid without haggling. 124. Never bargain or cheapen anything whilst you buy by the art. So be it ordained. 125. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LAW OF THE LAND \"Tis the Old Law and the most important of all laws, that no one may do anything which will endanger any of the craft, or bring them into contact with the law of the land or any persecutors. 126. In any dispute between Brethren, no one may invoke any laws but those of the craft. 127. Or any tribunal but that of the Priestess, Priest and Elders. 128. DISCUSSION OF WITCHCRAFT It is not forbidden to say as Christians do, \"There be witchcraft in the land,\" because our oppressors of old make it a heresy not to believe in witchcraft and so a crime to deny it which thereby puts you under suspicion. 129. But ever say, \"I know not of it here, perchance there may be but afar off, I know not where.\" 130. But ever speak of them as old crones, consorting with the devil and riding through the air. 131. And ever say, \"But how may many ride the air if they be not as light as thistledown.\" 132. But the curse of the Goddess be on any who cast suspicion on any of the Brotherhood. 133. Or who speak of any real meeting-place or where they bide. 134. WORTCUNNING the craft keep books with the names of all herbs which are good, and all cures so all may learn. 135. But keep another book with all the Bales and Apies and let only the Elders and other trustworthy people have this knowledge. So be it ordained. 136. And may the blessings of the gods be on all who keep these Laws, and the curses of both the God and the Goddess be on all who break them. 137. USE OF THE ART Remember the art is the secret of the gods and may only be used in earnest and never for show or vainglory. 138. Magicians and Christians may taunt us saying, \"You have no power, show us your power. Do magic before our eyes, then only will we believe,\" seeking to cause us to betray the art before them. 139. Heed them not, for the art is holy and may only be used in need, and the curse of the gods be on any who break this Law. 140. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"RESIGNATIONS It ever be the way with women and with men also, that they ever seek new love. 141. Nor should we reprove them for this. 142. But it may be found a disadvantage to the craft. 143. And so many a time it has happened that a High Priest or a High Priestess, impelled by love, hath departed with their love. That is, they left the Coven. 144. Now if the High Priestess wishes to resign, she may do so in full Coven. 145. And this resignation is valid. 146. But if they should run off without resigning, who may know if they may not return in a few months? 147. So the Law is, if a High Priestess leaves her Coven, she be taken back and all be as before. 148. Meanwhile, if she has a deputy, that deputy shall act as High Priestess for as long as the High Priestess is away. 149. If she returns not at the end of a year and a day, then shall the Coven elect a new High Priestess, 150. Unless there is a good reason to the contrary. 151. The person who has done the work should reap the benefit of the reward. If somebody else is elected, the deputy is made maiden and deputy of the High Priestess. 152. TRAINING It has been found that practicing the art doth cause a fondness between aspirant and tutor, and it is the cause of better results if this be so. 153. And if for any reason this be undesireable, it can easily be avoided by both persons from the outset firmly resolving in their minds to be as brother and sister or parent and child. 154. And it is for this reason that a man may be taught only by a woman and a woman by a man, and women and women should not attempt these practices together. So be it ordained. 155. PUNISHMENT Order and discipline must be kept. 156. A High Priestess or a High Priest may, and should, punish all faults. 157. To this end all the craft must receive correction willingly. 158. All properly prepared, the culprit kneeling should be told his fault and his sentence pronounced. 159. Punishment should be followed by something amusing. 160. The culprit must acknowledge the justice of the punishment by kissing the hand on receiving sentence and again thanking for punishment received. So be it ordained. 161.

Covens in either lineage have probably cross referenced and 'corrected' what they took to be errors. (For example, in Law 60, I use the word 'arraigned'.

But in Art Magic, it is a barrier against forces raised, and when once in the Magus may not leave without great danger. If any great danger is manifested it would be advisable to take refuge in the Circle; but ordinarily sword or athame in hand is perfect protection against anything.

Also it is the law that contentment thou shalt learn, through suffering, and from long years, and from nobility of mind and of purpose. FOR THE WISE NEVER GROW OLD .

Chants, Spells, Invocations. Invoking the Goddess, etc. 2. Projection of the Astral Body, or Trance. 3. Incense, Drugs, Wine, etc. Any potion which aids to release the Spirit. 4. Dancing 5. Blood control. Use of the Cords. 6. The Scourge. 7. The Great Rite. 8. You can combine many of these ways to produce more power. To practice the Art successfully, you need the following five things: Intention. You must have the absolute will to succeed, the firm belief that you can do so and the determination to win through against all obstacles. 1. Preparation. You must be properly prepared. 2. Invocation. The Mighty Ones must be invoked. 3. Consecration. The Circle must be properly cast and consecrated and you must have properly consecrated tools. 4. Purification. You must be purified. 5. Hence there are 5 things necessary before you can start, and then 8 Paths or Ways leading to the Centre. For instance, you can combine 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 together in one rite; or 4, 6 and 7 together with 1 and 2, or with 3 perhaps. The more ways you can combine, the more power you produce. It is not meet to make offering of less than two score lashes to the Goddess, for here be a mystery. The fortunate numbers be 3, 7, 9 and thrice 7 which be 21. And these numbers total two score, so a less perfect or fortunate number would not be a perfect prayer. Also the Fivefold Salute be 5, yet it be 8 kisses; for there be 2 feet, 2 knees and 2 breasts.

But unless confined in a circle it will be swiftly dissapated. Hence the importance of a poroperly constructed circle. Power seems to exude from the body via the skin and possibly from the orifices of the body; hence you should be properly prepared. The slightest dirt spoils everything, which shows the importance of thorough cleanliness. The attitude of mind has great effect, so only work with a spirit of reverence. A little wine taken and repeated during the ceremony, if necessary, helps to produce the power. Other strong drinks or drugs may be used, but it is necessary to be very moderate, as if you are confused, even slightly, you cannot control the power you evoke. The simplest way is by dancing and singing monotonous chants, slowly at first and gradually quickening the tempo until giddiness ensues. Then the calls may be used, or even wild and meaningful shrieking produces power. But this method inflames the mind and renders it difficult to control the power, though control may be gained through practice. The scourge is a far better way, for it stimulates and excites both body and soul, yet one easily retains control. The Great Rite is far the best. It releases enormous power, but the conditions and circumstances make it difficult for the mind to maintain control at first. It is again a matter of practice and the natural strength of the operator's will and in a lesser degree those of his assistants. If, as of old, there were many trained assistants present and all wills properly attuned, wonders occur. Sorcerors chiefly used the blood sacrifice; and while we hold this to be evil we cannot deny that this method is very efficient. Power flashes forth from newly shed blood, instead of slowly exuding as by our method. The victim's terror and anguish add keenness and quite a small animal can yield enormous power. The great difficulty is in the human mind controlling the power of the lower animal mind. But sorcerors claim they have methods for effecting this and that the difficulty disappears the higher the animal used and when the victim is human disappears entirely. (The practice is an abomination, but it is so.) Priests know this well; and by their auto-da-fe's, with the victim's pain and terror (the fires acting much the same as circles), obtained enormous power. Of old the Flagellants certainly evoked power, but through not being confined by a circle most was lost. The amount of power raised was so great and continuous that anyone with knowledge could direct and use it; and it is most probable that the classical and heathen sacrifices were used in the same way. There are whispers that when the human victim was a willing sacrifice, with his mind directed on the Great Work and with highly skilled assistants, wonders ensued - but of this I would not speak.

For initiation, tie hands behind back, pull up to small of back and tie ends in front of throat, leaving a cable-tow to lead by, hanging down in front. (Arms thus form a triangle at back.) When initiate is kneeling at altar, the cable-tow is tied to a ring in the altar. A short cord is tied like a garter round the initiate's left leg above the knee, with ends tucked in. Another is tied round right ankle and ends tucked in so as to be out of the way while moving about. These cords are used to tie feet together while initiate is kneeling at the altar and must be long enough to do this firmly. Knees must also be firmly tied. This must be carefully done. If the aspirant complains of pain the bonds must be loosened slightly; always remember the object being to retard the blood flow enough to induce a trance state. This involves slight discomfort; but great discomfort prevents the trance state, so it is best to spend some little time loosening and tightening the bonds until they are just right. The aspirant alone can tell you when this is so. This, of course, does not apply to the initiation, as then no trance is desired; but for the purpose of ritual it is good that the initiates be bound firmly enough to feel they are absolutely helpless but without discomfort. The Measure (in the First Degree) is taken thus: Height, round neck, across the heart and across the genitals. The old custom is, if anyone were guilty of betraying the secrets, their measure was buried at midnight in a boggy place, with curses that \"as the measure rots, so they will rot.\" NOTES published in Janet and Stewart Farrar's The Witches' Way; from GBG's BOS (Text B or C; it's the same in each). l"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" The Meeting Dance The Maiden should lead.

She at last leads them into a right-hand spiral. When the center is reached (and this had better be marked by a stone) she suddenly turns round and dances back, kissing each man as she comes to him. All men and women turn likewise and dance back, men kissing women and women kissing men. All in time to music, it is a merry game, but must be practiced to be done well. Note, the musician should watch the dancers and make the music fast or slow as is best. For the beginners it should be slow, or there will be confusion.

Many of these have been forgotten by us here; but we know they used cries of IAU , HAU , which seems much like the cry of the ancients: EVO or EAVOE . Much dependeth upon the pronunciation if this be so. In my youth when I heard the cry IAU it seemed to me to be AEIOU , or rather HAAEE IOOUU or AA EE IOOOOUU . This may be but the way to prolong it to make it fit for a call; but it suggests that these may be the initials of an invocation, as AGLA used to be. And of sooth the whole Hebrew Alphabet is said to be such and for this reason is recited as a most powerful charm. At least this is certain, these cries during the dances do have a powerful effect, as I myself have seen. Other calls are: IEHOUA and EHEIE . Also HO HO HO ISE ISE ISE . IEO VEO VEO VEO VEOV OROV OV OVOVO may be a spell, but it is more likely to be a call. 'Tis like the EVOE EVOE of the Greeks and the Heave Ho! of sailors. Emen hetan and Ab hur, ab hus seem calls; as Horse and hattock, horse and go! Horse and pellatis, ho, ho, ho! Thout, tout a tout tout, throughout and about and Rentum tormentum are probably mispronounced attempts at a forgotten formula, though they may have been invented by some unfortunate being tortured, to evade telling the real formula.

The circle was marked out and people stationed to whip up the dancers. A fire or candle was within it in the direction where the object of the rite was supposed to be. Then all danced round until they felt they had raised enough power. If the rite was to banish they started deosil and finished tuathil, so many rounds of each. Then they formed a line with linked hands and rushed towards the fire shouting the thing they wanted. They kept it up 'til they were exhausted or until someone fell in a faint, when they were said to have taken the spell to its destination.

Armour is heavy, yet it is a proud burden and a man standeth upright in it. Limiting and constraining any of the senses serves to increase the concentration of another. Shutting the eyes aids the hearing. So the binding of the Initiate's hands increases the mental perception, while the scourge increaseth the inner vision. So the Initiate goeth through it proudly, like a princess, knowing it but serves to increase her glory. But this can only be done by the aid of another intelligence and in a circle, to prevent the power thus generated being lost. Priests attempt to do the same with their scourgings and mortifications of the flesh. But lacking the aid of bonds and their attention being distracted by their scourging themselves and what little power they do produce being dissipated, as they do not usually work within a circle, it is little wonder that they oft fail. Monks and hermits do better, as they are apt to work in tiny cells and caves, which in some ways act as circles. The Knights of the Temple, who used mutually to scourge each other in an octagon, did better stil; but they apparently did not know the virtue of bonds and did evil, man to man. But perhaps some did know. What of the Church's charge that they wore girdles or cords?

Deep and prolonged meditation may do it, but only if you are a natural, and usually prolonged fasting is necessary. Of old the monks and nuns obtained visions by long vigils, combined with fasting and flagellation til blood came; other mortifications of the flesh were practiced which resulted in visions. In the East 'tis tried with various tortures whilst sitting in a cramped position, which retarded the flow of blood; these tortures, long and continued, gave good results. In the Art, we are taught an easier way, that is, to intensify the imagination, at the same time controlling the blood supply, and this may best be done by using the ritual. Incense is good to propitiate the spirits, also to induce relaxation to the aspirant and to help build up the atmosphere which is necessary for suggestibility. Myrrh, Gum Mastic, Aromatic Rush Roots, Cinnamon Bark, Musk, Juniper, Sandalwood and Ambergris, in combination, are all good, but the best of all is Patchouli. The circle being formed, and everything properly prepared, the aspirant should first bind and take his tutor into the circle, invoke suitable spirits for the operation, dance round till giddy, meanwhile invoking and announcing the object of the work, then he should use the flagellum. Then the tutor should in turn bind the aspirant - but very lightly, so as not to cause discomfort - but enough to retard the blood slightly. Again they should dance round, then at the Altar the tutor should use the flagellum with light, steady, slow and monotonous strokes. It is very important that the pupil should see the strokes coming, as this has the effect of passing, and helps greatly to stimulate the imagination. It is important that the strokes be not hard, the object being to do no more than draw the blood to that part and away from the brain; this, with the light binding, slowing down the circulation of the blood, and the passes, soon induce a drowsy stupor. The tutor should watch for this, and as soon as the aspirant speaks or sleeps the flagellum should cease. The tutor should also watch that the pupil becomes not cold, and if the pupil struggles or seems distressed he should at once be awakened. Be not discouraged if no results come at the first experiment - results usually occur after two or three attempts. It will be found that after two or three attempts or experiments results will come, and soon more quickly; also soon much of the ritual may be shortened, but never forget to invoke the Goddess or to form the circle, and for good results 'tis ever better to do too much ritual rather than do too little at first. It has been found that this practice doth often cause a fondness between aspirant and tutor, and it is a cause of better results if this be so. If for any reason it is undesireable there be any great fondness between aspirant and tutor this may easily be avoided by both parties from the onset, by firmly resolving in their minds that if any fondness ensues it shall be that of a brother and sister, or parent and child, and it is for this reason that a man may only be taught by a woman and a woman by a man, and that man and man or woman and woman should never attempt these practices together, and may all the curses of the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Mighty Ones be on any who make such an attempt. Remember, the circle properly constructed is ever necessary to prevent the power released being dissipated; it is also a barrier against any disturbing or mischievious forces; for to obtain good results you must be free from all disturbances. Remember, darkness, points of light gleaming amid the surrounding dark, incense and the steady passes by a white arm, are not as stage effects but rather they are mechanical instruments which serve to start the suggestion which later unlocks the knowledge that it is possible to obtain the divine ecstacy, and so attain to knowledge and communication with the Divine Goddess. When once you have attained this, ritual is needless, as you may attain the state of ecstacy at will, but 'til then or, if having obtained or attained it yourself, you wish to bring a companion to that state of joy, ritual is best.

The same ritual as to gain the Sight may be used, but have a comfortable couch. Kneel so that you have your thigh, belly and chest well supported, the arms strained forward and bound one on each side, so that there is a decided feeling of being pulled forward. As the trance is induced, you should feel a striving to push yourself out of the top of your head. The scourge should be given a dragging action, as if to drive or drag you out. Both wills should be thoroughly in tune, keeping a constant and equal strain. When trance comes, your tutor may help you by softly calling your name. You will probably feel yourself drawn out of your body as if through a narrow opening, and find yourself standing beside your tutor, looking at the body on the couch. Strive to communicate with your tutor first; if they have the Sight they will probably see you. Go not far afield at first, and 'tis better to have one who is used to leaving the body with you. A note: When, having succeeded in leaving the body, you desire to return, in order to cause the spirit body and the material body to coincide, THINK OF YOUR FEET .

But when made you should be able to borrow or obtain an Athame. So having made your circle, erect an altar. Any small table or chest will do. There must be fire on it (a candle will suffice) and your book. For good results incense is best if you can get it, but coals in a chafing dish burning sweet-smelling herbs will do. A cup if you would have cakes and wine and a platter with the signs drawn into same in ink, showing a pentacle. A scourge is easily made (note, the scourge has eight tails and five knots in each tail). Get a white-hilted knife and a wand (a sword is not necessary). Cut the marks with Athame. Purify everything, then consecrate your tools in proper form and ever be properly prepared. But ever remember, magical operations are useless unless the mind can be brought to the proper attitude, keyed to the uttmost pitch. Affirmations must be made clearly and the mind should be inflamed with desire. With this frenzy of will you may do as much with simple tools as with the most complete set. But good and especially ancient tools have their own aura. They do help to bring about that reverential spirit, the desire to learn and develop your powers. For this reason witches ever try to obtain tools from sorcerers, who being skilled men make good tools and consecrate them well, giving them mighty power. But a great witch's tools also gain much power; and you should ever strive to make any tools you manufacture of the finest materials you can obtain, to the end that they may absorb your power the more easily. And of course if you may inherit or obtain another witch's tools, power will flow from them.

It is said that in olden days ale or mead was often used instead of wine. It is said that spirits or anything can be used, \"so long as it has life\" (i.e. has a kick). All are brothers and sisters, for this reason; that even the High Priestess must submit to the scourge. The only exception to the rule that a man only be initiated by a woman and a woman by a man, is that a mother may initiate her daughter and a father his son, because they are part of themselves. A woman may impersonate either the God or the Goddess, but a man may only impersonate the God. Ever remember, if tempted to admit or boast of belonging to the cult, you may be endangering your brothers and sisters. For though now the fires of persecution have died down, who knows when they may be revived? Many priests have knowledge of our secrets and they full well know that much religious bigotry has died down or calmed down, that many people would wish to join our cult if the truth were known of its joys and the churches would lose power. So if we take many recruits we may loose the fires of persecution against us again. So ever keep the secrets. Those taking part in a rite must know exactly what results they wish to attain and must keep all their minds firmly fixed on the desired result, without wavering.

All join hands to form a ring about the HPS. Heads turned left and eyes tightly shut, will a flowing river of power about the circle, moving from one through the next, from man to woman and woman to man, about the circle without beginning or end, gathering strength as it goes. When the circle is set thus, in motionless intensity, the HPS begins to clap to the rhythym of the heart-beat. And upon this signal all open their eyes and step widdershins; slowly at first but with a quickening step as the HPS quickens the beat of her clap, until three rounds are complete. And this must be accomplished smoothly and without awkwardness. Now change direction and dance deosil to the Witches' Rune or some other tune; slowly at first, but faster and ever faster until, the Power being at its peak, the HPS shall release it crying: \"Down !\", whereupon all shall fall to the ground to sit in a circle facing in.
