And yet what necessity was there for his having a regular master?\" 828 Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great officers in the court, saying, \"Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.\" 829 Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, \"Let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in the apartments. 830 \"The wall of my Master is several fathoms high.

To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all. 5 5. 'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents. There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after consideration. 6 6. 'Let your Majesty also say, \"Benevolence and righteousness, and let these be your only themes.\" Why must you use that word -- \"profit?\". 7 1. Mencius, another day, saw King Hÿi of Liang. The king went and stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer, said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?' 8 2. Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these things. If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they do not find pleasure. 9 3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, He measured out and commenced his marvellous tower; He measured it out and planned it. The people addressed themselves to it, And in less than a day completed it. When he measured and began it, he said to them -- Be not so earnest: But the multitudes came as if they had been his children. The king was in his marvellous park; The does reposed about, The does so sleek and fat: And the white birds came glistening. The king was by his marvellous pond; How full was it of fishes leaping about!\" 'King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and his pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower \"the marvellous tower,\" calling the pond \"the marvellous pond,\" and rejoicing that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles. The ancients caused the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could enjoy it. 10 4. 'In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, \"O sun, when wilt thou expire? We will die together with thee.\" The people wished for Chieh's death, though they should die with him. Although he had towers, ponds, birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?' 11 1. King Hÿi of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost.

And yet the people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people increase. How is this?' 12 2. Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war; -- let me take an illustration from war. -- The soldiers move forward to the sound of the drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run. Some run a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop. What would you think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred paces?' The kind said, 'They should not do so. Though they did not run a hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' 'Since your Majesty knows this,' replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms. 13 3. 'If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will be more than can be eaten. If close nets are not allowed to enter the pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed. If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time, the wood will be more than can be used. When the grain and fish and turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their dead, without any feeling against any. This condition, in which the people nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any, is the first step of royal government. 14 4. 'Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five mýu, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk. In keeping fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected, and persons of seventy years may eat flesh. Let there not be taken away the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred mý, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall not suffer from hunger. Let careful attention be paid to education in schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and grey-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their backs or on their heads. It never has been that the ruler of a State, where such results were seen, -- persons of seventy wearing silk and eating flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunder nor cold, -- did not attain to the royal dignity. 15 5. 'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any restrictive arrangements. There are people dying from famine on the roads, and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them. When people die, you say, \"It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year.\" In what does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying -- \"It was not I; it was the weapon?\" Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to you.' 16 1.

This is leading on beasts to devour men. 20 5. 'Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When a prince, being the parent of his people, administers his government so as to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is his parental relation to the people?' 21 6. Chung-nþ said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden images to bury with the dead? So he said, because that man made the semblances of men, and used them for that purpose:-- what shall be thought of him who causes his people to die of hunger?' 22 1. King Hÿi of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger State than Tsin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we have been defeated by Ch'i, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we have lost seven hundred lþ of territory to Ch'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ch'ÿ. I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away, once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?' 23 2. Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred lþ square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity. 24 3. 'If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the strong-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors,-- you will then have a people who can be employed, with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp weapons of the troops of Ch'in and Ch'ÿ. 25 4. 'The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents. Their parents suffer from cold and hunger.

Mencius went to see the king Hsiang of Liang. 29 2. On coming out from the interview, he said to some persons, 'When I looked at him from a distance, he did not appear like a sovereign; when I drew near to him, I saw nothing venerable about him. Abruptly he asked me, \"How can the kingdom be settled?\" I replied, \"It will be settled by being united under one sway.\" 30 3. '\"Who can so unite it?\" 31 4. 'I replied, \"He who has no pleasure in killing men can so unite it.\" 32 5. \"'Who can give it to him?\" 33 6. 'I replied, \" All the people of the nation will unanimously give it to him. Does your Majesty understand the way of the growing grain? During the seventh and eighth months, when drought prevails, the plants become dry. Then the clouds collect densely in the heavens, they send down torrents of rain, and the grain erects itself, as if by a shoot. When it does so, who can keep it back? Now among the shepherds of men throughout the nation, there is not one who does not find pleasure in killing men. If there were one who did not find pleasure in killing men, all the people in the nation would look towards him with outstretched necks. Such being indeed the case, the people would flock to him, as water flows downwards with a rush, which no one can repress.\"' 34 1.

Mencius answered, 'The love and protection of the people; with this there is no power which can prevent a ruler from attaining to it.' 37 4. The king asked again, 'Is such an one as I competent to love and protect the people?' Mencius said, 'Yes.' 'How do you know that I am competent for that?' 'I heard the following incident from Hÿ Ho:-- \"The king,\" said he, \"was sitting aloft in the hall, when a man appeared, leading an ox past the lower part of it. The king saw him, and asked, Where is the ox going? The man replied, We are going to consecrate a bell with its blood. The king said, Let it go. I cannot bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death. The man answered, Shall we then omit the consecration of the bell ? The king said, How can that be omitted? Change it for a sheep.\" I do not know whether this incident really occurred.' 38 5. The king replied, 'It did,' and then Mencius said, 'The heart seen in this is sufficient to carry you to the royal sway. The people all supposed that your Majesty grudged the animal, but your servant knows surely, that it was your Majesty's not being able to bear the sight, which made you do as you did.' 39 6. The king said, 'You are right. And yet there really was an appearance of what the people condemned. But though Chþ be a small and narrow State, how should I grudge one ox? Indeed it was because I could not bear its frightened appearance, as if it were an innocent person going to the place of death, that therefore I changed it for a sheep.' 40 7. Mencius pursued, 'Let not your Majesty deem it strange that the people should think you were grudging the animal. When you changed a large one for a small, how should they know the true reason? If you felt pained by its being led without guilt to the place of death, what was there to choose between an ox and a sheep? The king laughed and said, 'What really was my mind in the matter? I did not grudge the expense of it, and changed it for a sheep!-- There was reason in the people's saying that I grudged it.' 41 8. 'There is no harm in their saying so,' said Mencius. 'Your conduct was an artifice of benevolence. You saw the ox, and had not seen the sheep. So is the superior man affected towards animals, that, having seen them alive, he cannot bear to see them die; having heard their dying cries, he cannot bear to eat their flesh. Therefore he keeps away from his slaughter-house and cook-room.' 42 9. The king was pleased, and said, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The minds of others, I am able by reflection to measure;\" -- this is verified, my Master, in your discovery of my motive. I indeed did the thing, but when I turned my Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"thoughts inward, and examined into it, I could not discover my own mind. When you, Master, spoke those words, the movements of compassion began to work in my mind. How is it that this heart has in it what is equal to the royal sway?' 43 10. Mencius replied, 'Suppose a man were to make this statement to your Majesty:-- \"My strength is sufficient to lift three thousand catties, but it is not sufficient to lift one feather;-- my eyesight is sharp enough to examine the point of an autumn hair, but I do not see a waggon-load of faggots;-- \"would your Majesty allow what he said?' 'No,' was the answer, on which Mencius proceeded, 'Now here is kindness sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to the people.-- How is this? Is an exception to be made here? The truth is, the feather is not lifted , because strength is not used; the waggon-load of firewood is not seen, because the eyesight is not used; and the people are not loved and protected, because kindness is not employed. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is because you do not do it, not because you are not able to do it.' 44 11. The king asked, 'How may the difference between the not doing a thing, and the not being able to do it, be represented? Mencius replied,'In such a thing as taking the T'ýi mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it, if you say to people-- \"I am not able to do it,\" that is a real case of not being able. In such a matter as breaking off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior, if you say to people-- \"I am not able to do it,\" that is a case of not doing it, it is not a case of not being able to do it. Therefore your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway, is not such a case as that of taking the T'ýi mountain under your arm, and leaping over the north sea with it. Your Majesty's not exercising the royal sway is a case like that of breaking off a branch from a tree. 45 12. 'Treat with the reverence due to age the elders in your own family, so that the elders in the families of others shall be similarly treated; treat with the kindness due to youth the young in your own family, so that the young in the families of others shall be similarly treated:-- do this, and the kingdom may be made to go round in your palm. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"His example affected his wife. It reached to his brothers, and his family of the State was governed by it.\"-- The language shows how king Wan simply took his kindly heart, and exercised it towards those parties. Therefore the carrying out his kindness of heart by a prince will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four seas, and if he do not carry it out, he will not be able to protect his wife and children. The way in which the ancients came greatly to surpass other men, was no other but this:-- simply that they knew well how to carry out, so as to affect others, what they themselves did. Now your kindness is sufficient to reach to animals, and no benefits are extended from it to reach the people.-- How is this? Is an exception to be made here? 46 13.

The king replied, 'No. How should I derive pleasure from these things? My object in them is to seek for what I greatly desire.' 49 16. Mencius said, 'May I hear from you what it is that you greatly desire?' The king laughed and did not speak. Mencius resumed, 'Are you led to desire it, because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for your mouth? Or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for your body? Or because you have not enough of beautifully coloured objects to delight your eyes? Or because you have not voices and tones enough to please your ears? Or because you have not enough of attendants and favourites to stand before you and receive your orders? Your Majesty's various officers are sufficient to supply you with those things. How can your Majesty be led to entertain such a desire on account of them?' 'No,' said the king; 'my desire is not on account of them.' Mencius added, 'Then, what your Majesty greatly desires may be known. You wish to enlarge your territories, to have Ch'in and Ch'ÿ wait at your court, to rule the Middle Kingdom, and to attract to you the barbarous tribes that surround it. But doing what you do to seek for what you desire is like climbing a tree to seek for fish.' 50 17. The king said, 'Is it so bad as that?' 'It is even worse,' was the reply. 'If you climb a tree to seek for fish, although you do not get the fish, you will not suffer any subsequent calamity. But doing what you do to seek for what you desire, doing it moreover with all your heart, you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamities.' The king asked, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?' Mencius said, 'If the people of Tsýu should fight with the people of Ch'ÿ, which of them does your Majesty think would conquer?' 'The people of Ch'ÿ would conquer.' 'Yes;-- and so it is certain that a small country cannot contend with a great, that few cannot contend with many, that the weak cannot contend with the strong. The territory within the four seas embraces nine divisions, each of a thousand lþ square. All Ch'þ together is but one of them. If with one part you try to subdue the other eight, what is the difference between that and Tsýu's contending with Ch'ÿ? For, with such a desire, you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment. 51 18. 'Now if your Majesty will institute a government whose action shall be benevolent, this will cause all the officers in the kingdom to wish to stand in your Majesty's court, and all the farmers to wish to plough in your Majesty's fields, and all the merchants, both travelling and stationary, to wish to store their goods in your Majesty's market-places, and all travelling strangers to wish to make their tours on your Majesty's roads, and all throughout the kingdom who feel aggrieved by their rulers to wish to come and complain to your Majesty. And when they are so bent, who will be able to keep them back?' 52 19. The king said, 'I am stupid, and not able to advance to this. I wish you, my Master, to assist my intentions. Teach me clearly; although I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will essay and try to carry your instructions into effect.' 53 20. Mencius replied, 'They are only men of education, who, without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain livelihood, it follows that they will not have a fixed heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do, in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license.

After this he may urge them, and they will proceed to what is good, for in this case the people will follow after it with ease. 55 22. 'Now, the livelihood of the people is so regulated, that, above, they have not sufficient wherewith to serve their parents, and, below, they have not sufficient wherewith to support their wives and children.

His Majesty told me that he loved music, and I was not prepared with anything to reply to him. What do you pronounce about that love of music?' Mencius replied, 'If the king's love of music were very great, the kingdom of Ch'þ would be near to a state of good government!' 59 2. Another day, Mencius, having an interview with the king, said, 'Your Majesty, I have heard, told the officer Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chwang, that you love music;-- was it so?' The king changed colour, and said, 'I am unable to love the music of the ancient sovereigns; I only love the music that suits the manners of the present age.' 60 3. Mencius said, 'If your Majesty's love of music were very great, Ch'þ would be near to a state of good government! The music of the present day is just like the music of antiquity, as regards effecting that.' 61 4. The king said, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?' Mencius asked, 'Which is the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music by yourself alone, or to enjoy it with others?' 'To enjoy it with others,' was the reply. 'And which is the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music with a few, or to enjoy it with many?' 'To enjoy it with many.' 62 5. Mencius proceeded, 'Your servant begs to explain what I have said about music to your Majesty. 63 6. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here.-- The people hear the noise of your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all, with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another, \"That's how our king likes his music! But why does he reduce us to this extremity of distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder brothers and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad.\" Now, your Majesty is hunting here.-- The people hear the noise of your carriages and horses, and see the beauty of your plumes and streamers, and they all, with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another, \"That's how our king likes his hunting! But why does he reduce us to this extremity of distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder brothers and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad.\" Their feeling thus is from no other reason but that you do not allow the people to have pleasure as well as yourself. 64 7. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here. The people hear the noise of your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all, delighted, and with joyful looks, say to one another, \"That sounds as if our king were free from all sickness!

'If your Majesty now will make pleasure a thing common to the people and yourself, the royal sway awaits you.' 66 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ asked, 'Was it so, that the park of king Wan contained seventy square lþ?' Mencius replied, 'It is so in the records.' 67 2. 'Was it so large as that?' exclaimed the king. 'The people,' said Mencius, 'still looked on it as small.' The king added, 'My park contains only forty square lþ, and the people still look on it as large. How is this?'

'When I first arrived at the borders of your kingdom, I inquired about the great prohibitory regulations, before I would venture to enter it; and I heard, that inside the barrier-gates there was a park of forty square lþ, and that he who killed a deer in it, was held guilty of the same crime as if he had killed a man.-- Thus those forty square lþ are a pitfall in the middle of the kingdom. Is it not with reason that the people look upon them as large?' 69 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ asked, saying, 'Is there any way to regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?' Mencius replied, 'There is. But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to be able, with a great country, to serve a small one,-- as, for instance, T'ang served Ko, and king Wan served the Kwan barbarians. And it requires a wise prince to be able, with a small country, to serve a large one,-- as the king T'ýi served the Hsün-yü, and Kýu-ch'ien served Wÿ. 70 2. 'He who with a areat State serves a small one, delights in Heaven. He who with a small State serves a large one, stands in awe of Heaven. He who delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and protection his own kingdom. 71 3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and will thus preserve its favouring decree.\"' 72 4. The king said,'A great saying! But I have an infirmity;-- I love valour.' 73 5. I beg your Majesty,' was the reply, 'not to love small valour. If a man brandishes his sword, looks fiercely, and says, \"How dare he withstand me?\"-- this is the valour of a common man, who can be the opponent only of a single individual. I beg your Majesty to greaten it. 74 6. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The king blazed with anger, And he marshalled his hosts, To stop the march to Chü, To consolidate the prosperity of Chýu, To meet the expectations of the nation.\" This was the valour of king Wan. King Wan, in one burst of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom. 75 7.

'Let now your Majesty also, in one burst of anger, give repose to all the people of the kingdom. The people are only afraid that your Majesty does not love valour.' 77 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ had an interview with Mencius in the Snow palace, and said to him, 'Do men of talents and worth likewise find pleasure in these things?' Mencius replied, 'They do; and if people generally are not able to enjoy themselves, they condemn their superiors. 78 2. 'For them, when they cannot enjoy themselves, to condemn their superiors is wrong, but when the superiors of the people do not make enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves, they also do wrong. 79 3. 'When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people, they also rejoice in his joy; when he grieves at the sorrow of his people, they also grieve at his sorrow. A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom ; a sympathy of sorrow will do the same:-- in such a state of things, it cannot be but that the ruler attain to the royal dignity. 80 4. 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'þ asked the minister Yen, saying, \"I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Chwan-fÿ, and Cbýo-wÿ, and then to bend my course southward along the shore, till I come to Lang-yû. What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns?\" 81 5. 'The minister Yen replied, \"An excellent inquiry! When the Son of Heaven visited the princes, it was called a tour of inspection, that is, be surveyed the States under their care. When the princes attended at the court of the Son of Heaven, it was called a report of office, that is, they reported their administration of their offices. Thus, neither of the proceedings was without a purpose. And moreover, in the spring they examined the ploughing, and supplied any deficiency of seed; in the autumn they examined the reaping, and supplied any deficiency of yield. There is the saying of the Hsiý dynasty,-- If our king do not take his ramble, what will become of our happiness? If our king do not make his excursion, what will become of our help? That ramble, and that excursion, were a pattern to the princes. 82 6. '\"Now, the state of things is different.-- A host marches in attendance on the ruler, and stores of provisions are consumed. The hungry are deprived of their food, and there is no rest for those who are called to toil. Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance, and the people proceed to the commission of wickedness. Thus the royal ordinances are violated, and the people are oppressed, and the supplies of food and drink flow away like water. The rulers yield themselves to the current, or they urge their way against it; they are wild; they are utterly lost:-- these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes. 83 7. '\"Descending along with the current, and forgetting to return, is what I call yielding to it. Pressing up against it, and forgetting to return, is what I call urging their way against it.

From that time he began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people, and calling the Grand music-master, he said to him-- \"Make for me music to suit a prince and his minister pleased with each other.\" And it was then that the Chþ-shýo and Chio-shýo were made, in the words to which it was said, \"Is it a fault to restrain one's prince?\" He who restrains his prince loves his prince.' 87 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ said, 'People all tell me to pull down and remove the Hall of Distinction. Shall I pull it down, or stop the movement for that object?' 88 2. Mencius replied, 'The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to the sovereigns. If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal government, then do not pull it down.' 89 3. The king said, 'May I hear from you what the true royal government is?' 'Formerly,' was the reply, 'king Wan's government of Ch'þ was as follows:-- The husbandmen cultivated for the government one-ninth of the land; the descendants of officers were salaried; at the passes and in the markets, strangers were inspected, but goods were not taxed: there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs; the wives and children of criminals were not involved in their guilt. There were the old and wifeless, or widowers; the old and husbandless, or widows; the old and childless, or solitaries ; the young and fatherless, or orphans:-- these four classes are the most destitute of the people, and have none to whom they can tell their wants, and king Wan, in the institution of his government with its benevolent action, made them the first objects of his regard, as it is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The rich may get through life well; But alas! for the miserable and solitary!\"' 90 4. The king said, 'O excellent words!' Mencius said, 'Since your Majesty deems them excellent, why do you not practise them?' 'I have an infirmity,' said the king; 'I am fond of wealth.' The reply was, 'Formerly, Kung-lþu was fond of wealth. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"He reared his ricks, and filled his granaries, He tied up dried provisions and grain, In bottomless bags, and sacks, That he might gather his people together, and glorify his State. With bows and arrows all-displayed, With shields, and spears, and battle-axes, large and small, He commenced his march.\" In this way those who remained in their old seat had their ricks and granaries, and those who marched had their bags of provisions.

If your Majesty loves beauty, let the people be able to gratify the same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?' 92 1. Mencius said to the king Hsüan of Ch'þ, 'Suppose that one of your Majesty's ministers were to entrust his wife and children to the care of his friend, while he himself went into Ch'ÿ to travel, and that, on his return, he should find that the friend had let his wife and children suffer from cold and hunger;-- how ought he to deal with him?' The king said, 'He should cast him off.' 93 2. Mencius proceeded, 'Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not regulate the officers under him, how would you deal with him?' The king said, 'Dismiss him.' 94 3. Mencius again said, 'If within the four borders of your kingdom there is not good government, what is to be done?' The king looked to the right and left, and spoke of other matters. Mencius : Chapter 3 Mencius : Chapter 4 95 1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hsüan of Ch'þ, said to him, 'When men speak of \"an ancient kingdom,\" it is not meant thereby that it has lofty trees in it, but that it has ministers sprung from families which have been noted in it for generations. Your Majesty has no intimate ministers even. Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to-day, and you do not know it.' 96 2. The king said, 'How shall I know that they have not ability, and so avoid employing them at all?' 97 3. The reply was, 'The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents and virtue only as a matter of necessity. Since he will thereby cause the low to overstep the honourable, and distant to overstep his near relatives, ought he to do so but with caution?

In accordance with this we have the saying, \"The people killed him.\" 100 6. 'You must act in this way in order to be the parent of the people.' 101 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ asked, saying, 'Was it so, that T'ang banished Chieh, and that king Wÿ smote Chýu?' Mencius replied, 'It is so in the records.' 102 2. The king said, 'May a minister then put his sovereign to death?' 103 3. Mencius said, 'He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature, is called a robber; he who outrages righteousness, is called a ruffian. The robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow. I have heard of the cutting off of the fellow Chýu, but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign to death, in his case.' 104 1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hsüan of Ch'þ, said to him, 'If you are going to build a large mansion, you will surely cause the Master of the workmen to look out for large trees, and when he has found such large trees, you will be glad, thinking that they will answer for the intended object.

The people of Ch'þ attacked Yen, and conquered it. 107 2. The king Hsüan asked, saying, 'Some tell me not to take possession of it for myself, and some tell me to take possession of it. For a kingdom of ten thousand chariots, attacking another of ten thousand chariots, to complete the conquest of it in fifty days, is an achievement beyond mere human strength. If I do not take possession of it, calamities from Heaven will surely come upon me. What do you say to my taking possession of it?' 108 3. Mencius replied, 'If the people of Yen will be pleased with your taking possession of it, then do so.-- Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle, namely king Wÿ. If the people of Yen will not be pleased with your taking possession of it, then do not do so.-- Among the ancients there was one who acted on this principle, namely king Wan. 109 4. 'When, with all the strength of your country of ten thousand chariots, you attacked another country of ten thousand chariots, and the people brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee, to meet your Majesty's host, was there any other reason for this but that they hoped to escape out of fire and water ? If you make the water more deep and the fire more fierce, they will in like manner make another revolution.' 110 1. The people of Ch'þ, having smitten Yen, took possession of it, and upon this, the princes of the various States deliberated together, and resolved to deliver Yen from their power. The king Hsüan said to Mencius, 'The princes have formed many plans to attack me:-- how shall I prepare myself for them?' Mencius replied, 'I have heard of one who with seventy lþ exercised all the functions of government throughout the kingdom. That was T'ang. I have never heard of a prince with a thousand lþ standing in fear of others.' 111 2. 'It is said in the Book of History, As soon as T'ang began his work of executing justice, he commenced with Ko. The whole kingdom had confidence in him. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes on the west murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the south. Their cry was-- \"Why does he put us last?\" Thus, the people looked to him, as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows. The frequenters of the markets stopped not. The husbandmen made no change in their operations. While he punished their rulers, he consoled the people. His progress was like the falling of opportune rain, and the people were delighted. It is said again in the Book of History, \"We have waited for our prince long; the prince's coming will be our reviving!\" 112 3. 'Now the ruler of Yen was tyrannizing over his people, and your Majesty went and punished him. The people supposed that you were going to deliver them out of the water and the fire, and brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee, to meet your Majesty's host. But you have slain their fathers and elder brothers, and put their sons and younger brothers in confinement. You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State, and are removing to Ch'þ its precious vessels. How can such a course be deemed proper?

There had been a brush between Tsýu and Lÿ, when the duke Mÿ asked Mencius, saying,'Of my officers there were killed thirty-three men, and none of the people would die in their defence. Though I sentenced them to death for their conduct, it is impossible to put such a multitude to death. If I do not put them to death, then there is the crime unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers, and not saving them. How is the exigency of the case to be met?' 115 2. Mencius replied, 'In calamitous years and years of famine, the old and weak of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and water-channels, and the able-bodied who have been scattered about to the four quarters, have amounted to several thousands. All the while, your granaries, 0 prince, have been stored with grain, and your treasuries and arsenals have been full, and not one of your officers has told you of the distress. Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been, and cruel to their inferiors. The philosopher Tsang said, \"Beware, beware.

The duke P'ing of Lÿ was about to leave his palace, when his favourite, one Tsang Ts'ang, made a request to him, saying, 'On other days, when you have gone out, you have given instructions to the officers as to where you were going. But now, the horses have been put to the carriage, and the officers do not yet know where you are going. I venture to ask.' The duke said, 'I am going to see the scholar Mang.' ' How is this?' said the other. 'That you demean yourself, prince, in paying the honour of the first visit to a common man, is, I suppose, because you think that he is a man of talents and virtue. By such men the rules of ceremonial proprieties and right are observed. But on the occasion of this Mang's second mourning, his observances exceeded those of the former. Do not go to see him, my prince.' The duke said, 'I will not.' 126 2. The officer Yo-chang entered the court, and had an audience. He said, 'Prince, why have you not gone to see Mang K'o?' the duke said, 'One told me that, on the occasion of the scholar Mang's second mourning, his observances exceeded those of the former. It is on that account that I have not gone to see him.' 'How is this!' answered Yo-chang. 'By what you call \"exceeding,\" you mean, I suppose, that, on the first occasion, he used the rites appropriate to a scholar, and, on the second, those appropriate to a great officer; that he first used three tripods, and afterwards five tripods.' The duke said, 'No; I refer to the greater excellence of the coffin, the shell, the grave-clothes, and the shroud.'

But to advance a man or to stop his advance is really beyond the power of other men. My not finding in the prince of Lÿ a ruler who would confide in me, and put my counsels into practice, is from Heaven.

Then, Chýu was removed from Wÿ-ting by no great interval of time. There were still remaining some of the ancient families and of the old manners, of the influence also which had emanated from the earlier sovereigns, and of their good government.

In consequence of these things, it took a long time for him to lose the throne. There was not a foot of ground which he did not possess. There was not one of all the people who was not his subject. So it was on his side, and king Wan at his beginning had only a territory of one hundred square lþ. On all these accounts, it was difficult for him immediately to attain to the royal dignity. 136 9. 'The people of Ch'þ have a saying-- \"A man may have wisdom and discernment, but that is not like embracing the favourable opportunity. A man may have instruments of husbandry, but that is not like waiting for the farming seasons.\" The present time is one in which the royal dignity may be easily attained. 137 10. 'In the flourishing periods of the Hsiý, Yin, and Chýu dynasties, the royal domain did not exceed a thousand lþ, and Ch'þ embraces so much territory. Cocks crow and dogs bark to one another, all the way to the four borders of the State:-- so Ch'þ possesses the people. No change is needed for the enlarging of its territory: no change is needed for the collecting of a population. If its ruler will put in practice a benevolent government, no power will be able to prevent his becoming sovereign. 138 11. 'Moreover, never was there a time farther removed than the present from the rise of a true sovereign: never was there a time when the sufferings of the people from tyrannical government were more intense than the present. The hungry readily partake of any food, and the thirsty of any drink.' 139 12. 'Confucius said, \"The flowing progress of virtue is more rapid than the transmission of royal orders by stages and couriers.\" 140 13. 'At the present time, in a country of ten thousand chariots, let benevolent government be put in practice, and the people will be delighted with it, as if they were relieved from hanging by the heels. With half the merit of the ancients, double their achievements is sure to be realized. It is only at this time that such could be the case.' 141 1. Kung-sun Ch'ýu asked Mencius, saying, 'Master, if you were to be appointed a high noble and the prime minister of Ch'þ, so as to be able to carry your principles into practice, though you should thereupon raise the ruler to the headship Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"of all the other princes, or even to the royal dignity, it would not be to be wondered at.-- In such a position would your mind be perturbed or not?' Mencius replied, 'No. At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind.' 142 2. Ch'ýu said, 'Since it is so with you, my Master, you are far beyond Mang Pan.' 'The mere attainment,' said Mencius, 'is not difficult. The scholar Kýo had attained to an unperturbed mind at an earlier period of life than I did.' 143 3. Ch'ýu asked, 'Is there any way to an unperturbed mind?' The answer was, 'Yes. 144 4. 'Pþ-kung Yÿ had this way of nourishing his valour:-- He did not flinch from any strokes at his body. He did not turn his eyes aside from any thrusts at them. He considered that the slightest push from any one was the same as if he were beaten before the crowds in the market-place, and that what he would not receive from a common man in his loose large garments of hair, neither should he receive from a prince of ten thousand chariots. He viewed stabbing a prince of ten thousand chariots just as stabbing a fellow dressed in cloth of hair. He feared not any of all the princes. A bad word addressed to him be always returned. 145 5. 'Mang Shih-shû had this way of nourishing his valour:-- He said, \"I look upon not conquering and conquering in the same way. To measure the enemy and then advance; to calculate the chances of victory and then engage:-- this is to stand in awe of the opposing force. How can I make certain of conquering? I can only rise superior to all fear.\" 146 6. 'Mang Shih-shû resembled the philosopher Tsang. Pþ-kung Yÿ resembled Tsze-hsiý. I do not know to the valour of which of the two the superiority should be ascribed, but yet Mang Shih-shû attended to what was of the greater importance. 147 7. 'Formerly, the philosopher Tsang said to Tsze-hsiang, \"Do you love valour? I heard an account of great valour from the Master. It speaks thus:-- 'If, on self-examination, I find that I am not upright, shall I not be in fear even of a poor man in his loose garments of hair-cloth? If, on self-examination, I find that I am upright, I will go forward against thousands and tens of thousands.'\" 148 8. Yet, what Mang Shih-shû maintained, being merely his physical energy, was after all inferior to what the philosopher Tsang maintained, which was indeed of the most importance.' 149 9. Kung-sun Ch'ýu said, 'May I venture to ask an explanation from you, Master, of how you maintain an unperturbed mind, and how the philosopher Kýo does the same?' Mencius answered,'Kýo says,-- \"What is not attained in words is not to be sought for in the mind; what produces dissatisfaction in the mind, is not to be helped by passion-effort.\" This last,-- when there is unrest in the mind, not to seek for relief from passion-effort, may be conceded. But not to seek in the mind for what is not attained in words cannot be conceded. The will is the leader of the passion-nature. The passion-nature pervades and animates the body. The will is first and chief, and the passion-nature is subordinate to it.

Ch'ýu observed, 'Since you say-- \"The will is chief, and the passion-nature is subordinate,\" how do you also say, \"Maintain firm the will, and do no violence to the passion-nature?\"' Mencius replied, 'When it is the will alone which is active, it moves the passion-nature. When it is the passion-nature alone which is active, it moves the will. For instance now, in the case of a man falling or running, that is from the passion-nature, and yet it moves the mind.' 151 11. 'I venture to ask,' said Ch'ýu again, 'wherein you, Master, surpass Kýo.' Mencius told him, 'I understand words. I am skilful in nourishing my vast, flowing passion-nature.' 152 12. Ch'ýu pursued, 'I venture to ask what you mean by your vast, flowing passion-nature!' The reply was, 'It is difficult to describe it. 153 13. 'This is the passion-nature:-- It is exceedingly great, and exceedingly strong. Being nourished by rectitude, and sustaining no injury, it fills up all between heaven and earth. 154 14. 'This is the passion-nature:-- It is the mate and assistant of righteousness and reason. Without it, man is in a state of starvation. 155 15. 'It is produced by the accumulation of righteous deeds; it is not to be obtained by incidental acts of righteousness. If the mind does not feel complacency in the conduct, the nature becomes starved. I therefore said, \"Kýo has never understood righteousness, because he makes it something external.\" 156 16. 'There must be the constant practice of this righteousness, but without the object of thereby nourishing the passion-nature. Let not the mind forget its work, but let there be no assisting the growth of that nature. Let us not be like the man of Sung. There was a man of Sung, who was grieved that his growing corn was not longer, and so he pulled it up. Having done this, he returned home, looking very stupid, and said to his people, \"I am tired to-day. I have been helping the corn to grow long.\" His son ran to look at it, and found the corn all withered. There are few in the world, who do not deal with their passion-nature, as if they were assisting the corn to grow long. Some indeed consider it of no benefit to them, and let it alone:-- they do not weed their corn. They who assist it to grow long, pull out their corn. What they do is not only of no benefit to the nature, but it also injures it.' 157 17. Kung-sun Ch'ýu further asked, 'What do you mean by saying that you understand whatever words you hear?' Mencius replied, 'When words are one-sided, I know how the mind of the speaker is clouded over. When words are extravagant, I know how the mind is fallen and sunk. When words are all-depraved, I know how the mind has departed from principle. When words are evasive, I know how the mind is at its wit's end.

On this Ch'ýu observed, 'Tsýi Wo and Tsze-kung were skilful in speaking. Zan Niÿ, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan, while their words were good, were distinguished for their virtuous conduct. Confucius united the qualities of the disciples in himself, but still he said, \"In the matter of speeches, I am not competent.\"-- Then, Master, have you attained to be a Sage?' 159 19. Mencius said, 'Oh! what words are these? Formerly Tsze-kung asked Confucius, saying, \"Master, are you a Sage?\" Confucius answered him, \"A Sage is what I cannot rise to. I learn without satiety, and teach without being tired.\" Tsze-kung said, \"You learn without satiety:-- that shows your wisdom. You teach without being tired:-- that shows your benevolence. Benevolent and wise:-- Master, you ARE a Sage.\" Now, since Confucius would not allow himself to be regarded as a Sage, what words were those?' 160 20. Ch'ýu said, 'Formerly, I once heard this:-- Tsze-hsiý, Tsze-yÿ, and Tsze-chang had each one member of the Sage. Zan Niÿ, the disciple Min, and Yen Yüan had all the members, but in small proportions. I venture to ask,-- With which of these are you pleased to rank yourself?' 161 21. Mencius replied, 'Let us drop speaking about these, if you please.' 162 22. Ch'ýu then asked, 'What do you say of Po-þ and ú Yin?' 'Their ways were different from mine,' said Mencius. 'Not to serve a prince whom he did not esteem, nor command a people whom he did not approve; in a time of good government to take office, and on the occurrence of confusion to retire:-- this was the way of Po-þ. To say-- \"Whom may I not serve? My serving him makes him my ruler. What people may I not command? My commanding them makes them my people.\" In a time of good government to take office, and when disorder prevailed, also to take office:-- that was the way of ú Yin. When it was proper to go into office, then to go into it; when it was proper to keep retired from office, then to keep retired from it; when it was proper to continue in it long, then to continue in it long - when it was proper to withdraw from it quickly, then to withdraw quickly:-- that was the way of Confucius. These were all sages of antiquity, and I have not attained to do what they did. But what I wish to do is to learn to be like Confucius.' 163 23. Ch'ýu said, 'Comparing Po-þ and ú Yin with Confucius, are they to be placed in the same rank?' Mencius replied, 'No. Since there were living men until now, there never was another Confucius.' 164 24. Ch'ýu said, 'Then, did they have any points of agreement with him?' The reply was,-- 'Yes. If they had been sovereigns over a hundred lþ of territory, they would, all of them, have brought all the princes to attend in their court, and have obtained the throne. And none of them, in order to obtain the throne, would have committed one act of unrighteousness, or put to death one innocent person. In those things they agreed with him.'

'Now, Tsýi Wo said, \"According to my view of our Master, he was far superior to Yýo and Shun.\" 167 27. 'Tsze-kung said, \"By viewing the ceremonial ordinances of a prince, we know the character of his government. By hearing his music, we know the character of his virtue.

There is the Ch'þ-lin among quadrupeds, the Fang-hwang among birds, the T'ýi mountain among mounds and ant-hills, and rivers and seas among rain-pools. Though different in degree, they are the same in kind. So the sages among mankind are also the same in kind. But they stand out from their fellows, and rise above the level, and from the birth of mankind till now, there never has been one so complete as Confucius.\"' Mencius : Chapter 5 Mencius : Chapter 6 169 1. Mencius said, 'He who, using force, makes a pretence to benevolence is the leader of the princes. A leader of the princes requires a large kingdom. He who, using virtue, practises benevolence is the sovereign of the kingdom. To become the sovereign of the kingdom, a prince need not wait for a large kingdom. T'ang did it with only seventy lþ, and king Wan with only a hundred. 170 2. 'When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in heart. They submit, because their strength is not adequate to resist. When one subdues men by virtue, in their hearts' core they are pleased, and sincerely submit, as was the case with the seventy disciples in their submission to Confucius. What is said in the Book of Poetry, \"From the west, from the east, From the south, from the north, There was not one who thought of refusing submission,\" is an illustration of this.' 171 1.

When throughout his kingdom there is leisure and rest from external troubles, let him, taking advantage of such a season, clearly digest the principles of his government with its legal sanctions, and then even great kingdoms will be constrained to stand in awe of him. 173 3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Before the heavens were dark w1th rain, I gathered the bark from the roots of the mulberry trees, And wove it closely to form the window and door of my nest; Now, I thought, ye people below, Perhaps ye will not dare to insult me.\" Confucius said, \"Did not he who made this ode understand the way of governing?\" If a prince is able rightly to govern his kingdom, who will dare to insult him? 174 4. 'But now the princes take advantage of the time when throughout their kingdoms there is leisure and rest from external troubles, to abandon themselves to pleasure and indolent indifference;-- they in fact seek for calamities for themselves. 175 5. 'Calamity and happiness in all cases are men's own seeking. 176 6. 'This is illustrated by what is said in the Book of Poetry,-- Be always studious to be in harmony with the ordinances of God, So you will certainly get for yourself much happiness;\" and by the passage ofthe Týi Chiah,-- \"When Heaven sends down calamities, it is still possible to escape from them; when we occasion the calamities ourselves, it is not possible any longer to live.\"' 177 1.

'If a ruler can truly practise these five things, then the people in the neighbouring kingdoms will look up to him as a parent. From the first birth of mankind till now, never has any one led children to attack their parent, and succeeded in his design. Thus, such a ruler will not have an enemy in all the kingdom, and he who has no enemy in the kingdom is the minister of Heaven. Never has there been a ruler in such a case who did not attain to the royal dignity.' 183 1. Mencius said, 'All men have a mind which cannot bear to see the sufferings of others. 184 2. 'The ancient kings had this commiserating mind, and they, as a matter of course, had likewise a commiserating government. When with a commiserating mind was practised a commiserating government, to rule the kingdom was as easy a matter as to make anything go round in the palm. 185 3. 'When I say that all men have a mind which cannot bear to see the sufferings of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus:-- even now-a-days, if men suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they will without exception experience a feeling of alarm and distress. They will feel so, not as a ground on which they may gain the favour of the child's parents, nor as a ground on which they may seek the praise of their neighbours and friends, nor from a dislike to the reputation of having been unmoved by such a thing. 186 4. 'From this case we may perceive that the feeling of commiseration is essential to man, that the feeling of shame and dislike is essential to man, that the feeling of modesty and complaisance is essential to man, and that the feeling of approving and disapproving is essential to man. 187 5. 'The feeling of commiseration is the principle of benevolence. The feeling of shame and dislike is the principle of righteousness. The feeling of modesty and complaisance is the principle of propriety. The feeling of approving and disapproving is the principle of knowledge. 188 6. 'Men have these four principles just as they have their four limbs.

And yet, the arrow-maker's only fear is lest men should not be hurt, and the armour-maker's only fear is lest men should be hurt. So it is with the priest and the coffin-maker. The choice of a profession, therefore, is a thing in which great caution is required. 191 2. 'Confucius said, \"It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighbourhood. If a man, in selecting a residence, do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?\" Now, benevolence is the most honourable dignity conferred by Heaven, and the quiet home in which man should awell. Since no one can hinder us from being so, if yet we are not benevolent;-- this is being not wise. 192 3. 'From the want of benevolence and the want of wisdom will ensue the entire absence of propriety and righteousness;-- he who is in such a case must be the servant of other men. To be the servant of men and yet ashamed of such servitude, is like a bowmaker's being ashamed to make bows, or an arrow-maker's being ashamed to make arrows. 193 4. 'If he be ashamed of his case, his best course is to practise benevolence. 194 5. 'The man who would be benevolent is like the archer. The archer adjusts himself and then shoots. If he misses, he does not murmur against those who surpass himself. He simply turns round and seeks the cause of his failure in himself.' 195 1. Mencius said, 'When any one told Tsze-lÿ that he had a fault, he rejoiced. 196 2. 'When Yü heard good words, he bowed to the speaker. 197 3.

He regarded virtue as the common property of himself and others, giving up his own way to follow that of others, and delighting to learn from others to practise what was good. 198 4.

Mencius said, 'Po-þ would not serve a prince whom he did not approve, nor associate with a friend whom he did not esteem. He would not stand in a bad prince's court, nor speak with a bad man. To stand in a bad prince's court, or to speak with a bad man, would have been to him the same as to sit with his court robes and court cap amid mire and ashes. Pursuing the examination of his dislike to what was evil, we find that he thought it necessary, if he happened to be standing with a villager whose cap was not rightly adjusted, to leave him with a high air, as if he were going to be defiled. Therefore, although some of the princes made application to him with very proper messages, he would not receive their gifts.-- He would not receive their gifts, counting it inconsistent with his purity to go to them. 201 2. 'Hÿi of Liÿ-hsiý was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out his principles. When neglected and left without office, he did not murmur. When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. Accordingly, he had a saying,\"You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side with breast and aims bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?\" Therefore, self-possessed, he companied with men indifferently, at the same time not losing himself. When he wished to leave, if pressed to remain in office, he would remain.-- He would remain in office, when pressed to do so, not counting it required by his purity to go away.' 202 3. Mencius said, 'Po-þ was narrow-minded, and Hÿi of Liÿ-hsiý was wanting in self-respect. The superior man will not manifest either narrow-mindedness, or the want of self-respect.'

Yet it is obliged to be given up and abandoned. This is because advantages of situation afforded by the Earth are not equal to the union arising from the accord of Men. 206 4. 'In accordance with these principles it is said, \"A people is bounded in, not by the limits of dykes and borders; a State is secured, not by the strengths of mountains and rivers; the kingdom is overawed, not by the sharpness and strength of arms.\" He who finds the proper course has many to assist him. He who loses the proper course has few to assist him. When this,-- the being assisted by few,-- reaches its extreme point, his own relations revolt from the prince. When the being assisted by many reaches its highest point, the whole kingdom becomes obedient to the prince. 207 5. 'When one to whom the whole kingdom is prepared to be obedient, attacks those from whom their own relations revolt, what must be the result? Therefore, the true ruler will prefer not to fight; but if he do fight, he must overcome.' 208 1. As Mencius was about to go to court to see the king, the king sent a person to him with this message,-- 'I was wishing to come and see you. But I have got a cold, and may not expose myself to the wind. In the morning I will hold my court. I do not know whether you will give me the opportunity of seeing you then.' Mencius replied, 'Unfortunately, I am unwell, and not able to go to the court.' 209 2. Next day, he went out to pay a visit of condolence to some one of the Tung-kwoh family, when Kung-sun Ch'ýu said to him, 'Yesterday, you declined going to the court on the ground of being unwell, and to-day you are going to pay a visit of condolence. May this not be regarded as improper?' 'Yesterday,' said Mencius, 'I was unwell; to-day, I am better:-- why should I not pay this visit?' 210 3. In the mean time, the king sent a messenger to inquire about his sickness, and also a physician. Mang Chung replied to them, 'Yesterday, when the king's order came, he was feeling a little unwell, and could not go to the court. To-day he was a little better, and hastened to go to court. I do not know whether he can have reached it by this time or not.' Having said this, he sent several men to look for Mencius on the way, and say to him, 'I beg that, before you return home, you will go to the court.' 211 4. On this, Mencius felt himself compelled to go to Ching Ch'ýu's, and there stop the night. Mr. Ching said to him, 'In the family, there is the relation of father and son; abroad, there is the relation of prince and minister. These are the two great relations among men. Between father and son the ruling principle is kindness. Between prince and minister the ruling principle is respect. I have seen the respect of the king to you, Sir, but I have not seen in what way you show respect to him.' Mencius replied, 'Oh! what words are these?

I do not dare to set forth before the king any but the ways of Yýo and Shun. There is therefore no man of Ch'þ who respects the king so much as I do.' 212 5. Mr. Ching said, 'Not so. That was not what I meant. In the Book of Rites it is said, \"When a father calls, the answer must be without a moment's hesitation. When the prince's order calls, the carriage must not be waited for.\" You were certainly going to the court, but when you heard the king's order, then you did not carry your purpose out. This does seem as if it were not in accordance with that rule of propriety.' 213 6. Mencius answered him, 'How can you give that meaning to my conduct? The philosopher Tsang said, \"The wealth of Tsin and Ch'ÿ cannot be equalled. Let their rulers have their wealth:-- I have my benevolence. Let them have their nobility:-- I have my righteousness. Wherein should I be dissatisfied as inferior to them?\" Now shall we say that these sentiments are not right? Seeing that the philosopher Tsang spoke them, there is in them, I apprehend, a real principle.-- In the kingdom there are three things universally acknowledged to be honourable. Nobility is one of them; age is one of them; virtue is one of them. In courts, nobility holds the first place of the three; in villages, age holds the first place; and for helping one's generation and presiding over the people, the other two are not equal to virtue. How can the possession of only one of these be presumed on to despise one who possesses the other two? 214 7. 'Therefore a prince who is to accomplish great deeds will certainly have ministers whom he does not call to go to him. When he wishes to consult with them, he goes to them. The prince who does not honour the virtuous, and delight in their ways of doing, to this extent, is not worth having to do with. 215 8. 'Accordingly, there was the behaviour of T'ang to ú Yin:-- he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became sovereign. There was the behaviour of the duke Hwan to Kwan Chung:-- he first learned of him, and then employed him as his minister; and so without difficulty he became chief of all the princes. 216 9. 'Now throughout the kingdom, the territories of the princes are of equal extent, and in their achievements they are on a level. Not one of them is able to exceed the others. This is from no other reason, but that they love to make ministers of those whom they teach, and do not love to make ministers of those by whom they might be taught. 217 10. 'So did T'ang behave to ú Yin, and the duke Hwan to Kwan Chung, that they would not venture to call them to go to them. If Kwan Chung might not be called to him by his prince, how much less may he be called, who would not play the part of Kwan Chung!' 218 1. Ch'an Tsin asked Mencius, saying, 'Formerly, when you were in Ch'þ, the king sent you a present Of 2,400 taels of fine silver, and you refused to accept it.

Mencius said, 'I did right in all the cases. 220 3. 'When I was in Sung, I was about to take a long journey. Travellers must be provided with what is necessary for their expenses. The prince's message was, 'A present against travelling-expenses.\" Why should I have declined the gift? 221 4. 'When I was in Hsieh, I was apprehensive for my safety, and taking measures for my protection. The message was, \"I have heard that you are taking measures to protect yourself, and send this to help you in procuring arms.\" Why should I have declined the gift? 222 5. 'But when I was in Ch'i, I had no occasion for money. To send a man a gift when he has no occasion for it, is to bribe him. How is it possible that a superior man should be taken with a bribe?' 223 1. Mencius having gone to P'ing-lÿ, addressed the governor of it, saying, 'If one of your spearmen should lose his place in the ranks three times in one day, would you, Sir, put him to death or not?' 'I would not wait for three times to do so,' was the reply. 224 2. Mencius said, 'Well then, you, Sir, have likewise lost your place in the ranks many times. In bad calamitous years, and years of famine, the old and feeble of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and water-channels, and the able-bodied, who have been scattered about to the four quarters, have amounted to several thousand.' The governor replied, 'That is a state of things in which it does not belong to me Chü-hsin to act.' 225 3. 'Here,' said Mencius, 'is a man who receives charge of the cattle and sheep of another, and undertakes to feed them for him;-- of course he must search for pasture-ground and grass for them. If, after searching for those, he cannot find them, will he return his charge to the owner? or will he stand by and see them die?' 'Herein,' said the officer, 'I am guilty.' 226 4. Another day, Mencius had an audience of the king, and said to him, 'Of the governors of your Majesty's cities I am acquainted with five, but the only one of them who knows his faults is K'ung Chü-hsin.' He then repeated the conversation to the king, who said, 'In this matter, I am the guilty one.' 227 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"1. Mencius said to Ch'þ Wý, 'There seemed to be reason in your declining the governorship of Ling-ch'iÿ, and requesting to be appointed chief criminal judge, because the latter office would afford you the opportunity of speaking your views. Now several months have elapsed, and have you yet found nothing of which you might speak?' 228 2. On this, Ch'þ Wý remonstrated on some matter with the king, and, his counsel not being taken, resigned his office and went away. 229 3. The people of Ch'þ said, 'In the course which he marked out for Ch'þ Wý he did well, but we do not know as to the course which he pursues for himself.' 230 4. His disciple Kung-tÿ told him these remarks. 231 5. Mencius said, 'I have heard that he who is in charge of an office, when he is prevented from fulfilling its duties, ought to take his departure, and that he on whom is the responsibility of giving his opinion, when he finds his words unattended to, ought to do the same. But I am in charge of no office; on me devolves no duty of speaking out my opinion:-- may not I therefore act freely and without any constraint, either in going forward or in retiring?' 232 2. Kung-sun Ch'ýu. said to Mencius, 'The position of a high dignitary of Ch'þ is not a small one; the road from Ch'þ to T'ang is not short. How was it that during all the way there and back, you never spoke to Hwan about the matters of your mission?' Mencius replied, 'There were the proper officers who attended to them. What occasion had I to speak to him about them?' Mencius : Chapter 7 Mencius : Chapter 8 233 1. Mencius went from Ch'þ to Lÿ to bury his mother. On his return to Ch'þ, he stopped at Ying, where Ch'ung Yü begged to put a question to him, and said, 'Formerly, in ignorance of my incompetency, you employed me to superintend the making of the coffin. As you were then pressed by the urgency of the business, I did not venture to put any question to you. Now, however, I wish to take the liberty to submit the matter. The wood of the coffin, it appeared to me, was too good.' 234 2. Mencius replied, 'Anciently, there was no rule for the size of either the inner or the outer coffin. In middle antiquity, Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"the inner coffin was made seven inches thick, and the outer one the same. This was done by all, from the sovereign to the common people, and not simply for the beauty of the appearance, but because they thus satisfied the natural feelings of their hearts. 235 3. 'If prevented by statutory regulations from making their coffins in this way, men cannot have the feeling of pleasure. If they have not the money to make them in this way, they cannot have the feeling of pleasure. When they were not prevented, and had the money, the ancients all used this style. Why should I alone not do so? 236 4. 'And moreover, is there no satisfaction to the natural feelings of a man, in preventing the earth from getting near to the bodies of his dead? 237 5. 'I have heard that the superior man will not for all the world be niggardly to his parents.' 238 1. Shan T'ung, on his own impulse, asked Mencius, saying, 'May Yen be smitten?' Mencius replied, 'It may. Tsze-k'wýi had no right to give Yen to another man, and Tsze-chih had no right to receive Yen from Tsze-k'wýi. Suppose there were an officer here, with whom you, Sir, were pleased, and that, without informing the king, you were privately to give to him your salary and rank; and suppose that this officer, also without the king's orders, were privately to receive them from you-- would such a transaction be allowable? And where is the difference between the case of Yen and this?' 239 2. The people of Ch'þ smote Yen. Some one asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it really the case that you advised Ch'þ to smite Yen?' He replied, 'No. Shan T'ung asked me whether Yen might be smitten, and I answered him, \"It may.\" They accordingly went and smote it. If he had asked me-- \"Who may smite it?\" I would have answered him, \"He who is the minister of Heaven may smite it.\" Suppose the case of a murderer, and that one asks me-- \"May this man be put to death?\" I will answer him-- \"He may.\" If he ask me-- \"Who may put him to death?\" I will answer him, \"The chief criminal judge may put him to death.\" But now with one Yen to smite another Yen:-- how should I have advised this?' 240 1. The people of Yen having rebelled, the king of Ch'þ said, 'I feel very much ashamed when I think of Mencius.' 241 2. Ch'an Chiý said to him, 'Let not your Majesty be grieved. Whether does your Majesty consider yourself or Chýu-kung the more benevolent and wise?' The king replied, 'Oh! what words are those?' 'The duke of Chýu,' said Chiý, 'appointed Kwan-shÿ to oversee the heir of Yin, but Kwan-shÿ with the power of the Yin State rebelled. If knowing that this would happen he appointed Kwan-shÿ, he was deficient in benevolence. If he appointed him, not knowing that it would happen, he was deficient in knowledge.

Ch'an Chiý accordingly saw Mencius, and asked him, saying, 'What kind of man was the duke of Chýu?' 'An ancient sage,' was the reply.

'Did the duke of Chýu. know that he would rebel, and purposely appoint him to that office?' Mencius said, 'He did not know.' 'Then, though a sage, he still fell into error?' 'The duke of Chýu,' answered Mencius, 'was the younger brother. Kwan-shÿ was his elder brother. Was not the error of Chýu-kung in accordance with what is right? 243 4. 'Moreover, when the superior men of old had errors, they reformed them. The superior men of the present time, when they have errors, persist in them. The errors of the superior men of old were like eclipses of the sun and moon. All the people witnessed them, and when they had reformed them, all the people looked up to them with their former admiration. But do the superior men of the present day only persist in their errors? They go on to apologize for them likewise.' 244 1. Mencius gave up his office, and made arrangements for returning to his native State. 245 2. The king came to visit him, and said, 'Formerly, I wished to see you, but in vain. Then, I got the opportunity of being by your side, and all my court joyed exceedingly along with me. Now again you abandon me, and are returning home. I do not know if hereafter I may expect to have another opportunity of seeing you.' Mencius replied, 'I dare not request permission to visit you at any particular time, but, indeed, it is what I desire.' 246 3. Another day, the king said to the officer Shih, 'I wish to give Mencius a house, somewhere in the middle of the kingdom, and to support his disciples with an allowance of 10,000 chung, that all the officers and the people may have such an example to reverence and imitate. Had you not better tell him this for me?' 247 4. Shih took advantage to convey this message by means of the disciple Ch'an, who reported his words to Mencius. 248 5. Mencius said, 'Yes; but how should the officer Shih know that the thing could not be? Suppose that I wanted to be rich, having formerly declined 100,000 chung, would my now accepting 10,000 be the conduct of one desiring riches? 249 6. 'Chþ-sun said, \"A strange man was Tsze-shÿ ú. He pushed himself into the service of government. His prince declining to employ him, he had to retire indeed, but he again schemed that his son or younger brother should be made a high officer. Who indeed is there of men but wishes for riches and honour? But he only, among the seekers of these, tried to monopolize the conspicuous mound. 250 7.

A person who wished to detain him on behalf of the king, came and sat down, and began to speak to him. Mencius gave him no answer, but leant upon his stool and slept. 253 3. The visitor was displeased, and said, 'I passed the night in careful vigil, before I would venture to speak to you, and you, Master, sleep and do not listen to me. Allow me to request that I may not again presume to see you.' Mencius replied, 'Sit down, and I will explain the case clearly to you. Formerly, if the duke Mÿ had not kept a person by the side of Tsze-sze, he could not have induced Tsze-sze to remain with him. If Hsieh Liÿ and Shan Hsiang had not had a remembrancer by the side of the duke Mÿ, he would not have been able to make them feel at home and remain with him. 254 4. 'You anxiously form plans with reference to me, but you do not treat me as Tsze-sze was treated. Is it you, Sir, who cut me? Or is it I who cut you? 255 1. When Mencius had left Ch'þ, Yin Shih spoke about him to others, saying, 'If he did not know that the king could not be made a T'ang or a Wÿ, that showed his want of intelligence. If he knew that he could not be made such, and came notwithstanding, that shows he was seeking his own benefit. He came a thousand lþ to wait on the king; because he did not find in him a ruler to suit him, he took his leave, but how dilatory and lingering was his departure, stopping three nights before he quitted Chýu! I am dissatisfied on account of this.' 256 2. The disciple Kýo informed Mencius of these remarks. 257 3. Mencius said, 'How should Yin Shih know me! When I came a thousand lþ to wait on the king, it was what I desired to do. When I went away because I did not find in him a ruler to suit me, was that what I desired to do? I felt myself constrained to do it. 258 4. 'When I stopped three nights before I quitted Chýu, in my own mind I still considered my departure speedy. I was hoping that the king might change.

I am daily hoping for this. 260 6. 'Am I like one of your little-minded people? They will remonstrate with their prince, and on their remonstrance not being accepted, they get angry; and, with their passion displayed in their countenance, they take their leave, and travel with all their strength for a whole day, before they will stop for the night.' 261 7. When Yin Shih heard this explanation, he said, 'I am indeed a small man.' 262 1. When Mencius left Ch'þ, Ch'ung Yü questioned him upon the way, saying, 'Master, you look like one who carries an air of dissatisfaction in his countenance. But formerly I heard you say-- \"The superior man does not murmur against Heaven, nor grudge against men.\"' 263 2. Mencius said, 'That was one time, and this is another. 264 3. 'It is a rule that a true royal sovereign should arise in the course of five hundred years, and that during that time there should be men illustrious in their generation. 265 4. 'From the commencement of the Chýu dynasty till now, more than seven hundred years have elapsed. Judging numerically, the date is past. Examining the character of the present time, we might expect the rise of such individuals in it. 266 5. 'But Heaven does not yet wish that the kingdom should enjoy tranquillity and good order. If it wished this, who is there besides me to bring it about? How should I be otherwise than dissatisfied?' 267 1. When Mencius left Ch'þ, he dwelt in Hsiÿ. There Kung-sun Ch'ýu asked him, saying, 'Was it the way of the ancients to hold office without receiving salary?' 268 2. Mencius replied, 'No; when I first saw the king in Ch'ung, it was my intention, on retiring from the interview, to go away. Because I did not wish to change this intention, I declined to receive any salary. 269 3. 'Immediately after, there came orders for the collection of troops, when it would have been improper for me to beg Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"permission to leave. But to remain so long in Ch'þ was not my purpose.' Mencius : Chapter 8 Mencius : Chapter 9 270 1. When the prince, afterwards duke Wan of T'ang, had to go to Ch'ÿ, he went by way of Sung, and visited Mencius. 271 2. Mencius discoursed to him how the nature of man is good, and when speaking, always made laudatory reference to Yýo and Shun. 272 3. When the prince was returning from Ch'ÿ, he again visited Mencius. Mencius said to him, 'Prince, do you doubt my words? The path is one, and only one. 273 4. 'Ch'ang Chi'en said to duke King of Ch'þ, \"They were men. I am a man. Why should I stand in awe of them?\" Yen Yüan said, \"What kind of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? He who exerts himself will also become such as he was.\" Kung-Ming ú said, \"King Wan is my teacher. How should the duke of Chýu deceive me by those words?\" 274 5. 'Now, T'ang, taking its length with its breadth, will amount, I suppose, to fifty lþ. It is small, but still sufficient to make a good State. It is said in the Book of History, \"If medicine do not raise a commotion in the patient, his disease will not be cured by it.\"' 275 1. When the duke Ting of T'ang died, the prince said to Yen Yÿ, 'Formerly, Mencius spoke with me in Sung, and in my mind I have never forgotten his words. Now, alas! this great duty to my father devolves upon me; I wish to send you to ask the advice of Mencius, and then to proceed to its various services' 276 2. Zan Yÿ accordingly proceeded to Tsýu, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'Is this not good? In discharging the funeral duties to parents, men indeed feel constrained to do their utmost. The philosopher Tsang said, \"When parents are alive, they should be served according to propriety; when they are dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and they should be sacrificed to according to propriety:-- this may be called filial piety.\" The ceremonies to be observed by the princes I have not learned, but I have heard these points:-- that the three years' mourning, the garment of coarse cloth with its lower edge even, and the eating of congee, were equally prescribed by the three dynasties, and binding on all, from the sovereign to the mass of the people.'

Zan Yÿ reported the execution of his commission, and the prince determined that the three years' mourning should be observed. His aged relatives, and the body of the officers, did not wish that it should be so, and said, 'The former princes of Lÿ, that kingdom which we honour, have, none of them, observed this practice, neither have any of our own former princes observed it. For you to act contrary to their example is not proper. Moreover, the History says,-- \"In the observances of mourning and sacrifice, ancestors are to be followed,\" meaning that they received those things from a proper source to hand them down.' 278 4. The prince said again to Zan Yÿ, 'Hitherto, I have not given myself to the pursuit of learning, but have found my pleasure in horsemanship and sword-exercise, and now I don't come up to the wishes of my aged relatives and the officers. I am afraid I may not be able to discharge my duty in the great business that I have entered on; do you again consult Mencius for me.' On this, Zan Yÿ went again to Tsýu, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'It is so, but he may not seek a remedy in others, but only in himself. Confucius said, \"When a prince dies, his successor entrusts the administration to the prime minister. He sips the congee. His face is of a deep black. He approaches the place of mourning, and weeps. Of all the officers and inferior ministers there is not one who will presume not to join in the lamentation, he setting them this example. What the superior loves, his inferiors will be found to love exceedingly. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it.\" The business depends on the prince.' 279 5. Zan Yÿ returned with this answer to his commission, and the prince said, 'It is so. The matter does indeed depend on me.' So for five months he dwelt in the shed, without issuing an order or a caution. All the officers and his relatives said, 'He may be said to understand the ceremonies.' When the time of interment arrived, they came from all quarters of the State to witness it. Those who had come from other States to condole with him, were greatly pleased with the deep dejection of his countenance and the mournfulness of his wailing and weeping. 280 1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius about the proper way of governing a kingdom. 281 2. Mencius said, 'The business of the people may not be remissly attended to. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In the day-light go and gather the grass, And at night twist your ropes; Then get up quickly on the roofs;-- Soon must we begin sowing again the grain.\" 282 3. 'The way of the people is this:-- If they have a certain livelihood, they will have a fixed heart; if they have not a certain livelihood, they have not a fixed heart. If they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish them:-- this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man? 283 4. 'Therefore, a ruler who is endowed with talents and virtue will be gravely complaisant and economical, showing a Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"respectful politeness to his ministers, and taking from the people only in accordance with regulated limits. 284 5. 'Yang Hÿ said, \"He who seeks to be rich will not be benevolent. He who wishes to be benevolent will not be rich.\" 285 6. 'The sovereign of the Hsiý dynasty enacted the fifty mýu allotment, and the payment of a tax. The founder of the Yin enacted the seventy mýu allotment, and the system of mutual aid. The founder of the Chýu enacted the hundred mýu allotment, and the share system. In reality, what was paid in all these was a tithe. The share system means mutual division. The aid system means mutual dependence. 286 7. 'Lung said, \"For regulating the lands, there is no better system than that of mutual aid, and none which is not better than that of taxing. By the tax system, the regular amount was fixed by taking the average of several years. In good years, when the grain lies about in abundance, much might be taken without its being oppressive, and the actual exaction would be small. But in bad years, the produce being not sufficient to repay the manuring of the fields, this system still requires the taking of the full amount. When the parent of the people causes the people to wear looks of distress, and, after the whole year's toil, yet not to be able to nourish their parents, so that they proceed to borrowing to increase their means, till the old people and children are found lying in the ditches and water-channels:-- where, in such a case, is his parental relation to the people?\" 287 8. 'As to the system of hereditary salaries, that is already observed in T'ang. 288 9. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"May the rain come down on our public field, And then upon our private fields!\" It is only in the system of mutual aid that there is a public field, and from this passage we perceive that even in the Chýu dynasty this system has been recognised. 289 10. 'Establish hsiang, hsü, hsio, and hsiýo,-- all those educational institutions,-- for the instruction of the people. The name hsiang indicates nourishing as its object; hsiýo, indicates teaching; and hsü indicates archery. By the Hsiý dynasty the name hsiýo was used; by the Yin, that of hsü; and by the Chýu, that of hsiang. As to the hsio, they belonged to the three dynasties, and by that name. The object of them all is to illustrate the human relations. When those are thus illustrated by superiors, kindly feeling will prevail among the inferior people below. 290 11. 'Should a real sovereign arise, he will certainly come and take an example from you; and thus you will be the teacher of the true sovereign. 291 12.

The duke afterwards sent Pþ Chan to consult Mencius about the nine-squares system of dividing the land. Mencius said to him, 'Since your prince, wishing to put in practice a benevolent government, has made choice of you and put you into this employment, you must exert yourself to the utmost. Now, the first thing towards a benevolent government must be to lay down the boundaries. If the boundaries be not defined correctly, the division of the land into squares will not be equal, and the produce available for salaries will not be evenly distributed. On this account, oppressive rulers and impure ministers are sure to neglect this defining of the boundaries. When the boundaries have been defined correctly, the division of the fields and the regulation of allowances may be determined by you, sitting at your ease. 293 14. 'Although the territory of T'Ang is narrow and small, yet there must be in it men of a superior grade, and there must be in it country-men. If there were not men of a superior grade, there would be none to rule the country-men. If there were not country-men, there would be none to support the men of superior grade. 294 15. 'I would ask you, in the remoter districts, observing the nine-squares division, to reserve one division to be cultivated on the system of mutual aid, and in the more central parts of the kingdom, to make the people pay for themselves a tenth part of their produce. 295 16. 'From the highest officers down to the lowest, each one must have his holy field, consisting of fifty mýu. 296 17. 'Let the supernumerary males have their twenty-five mýu. 297 18. 'On occasions of death, or removal from one dwelling to another, there will be no quitting the district. In the fields of a district, those who belong to the same nine squares render all friendly offices to one another in their going out and coming in, aid one another in keeping watch and ward, and sustain one another in sickness. Thus the people are brought to live in affection and harmony. 298 19. 'A square lþ covers nine squares of land, which nine squares contain nine hundred mýu. The central square is the public field, and eight families, each having its private hundred mýu, cultivate in common the public field. And not till the public work is finished, may they presume to attend to their private affairs. This is the way by which the country-men are distinguished from those of a superior grade. 299 20.

There came from Ch'ÿ to T'ang one Hsü Hsing, who gave out that he acted according to the words of Shan-nang. Coming right to his gate, he addressed the duke Wan, saying, 'A man of a distant region, I have heard that you, Prince, are practising a benevolent government, and I wish to receive a site for a house, and to become one of your people.' The duke Wan gave him a dwelling-place. His disciples, amounting to several tens, all wore clothes of haircloth, and made sandals of hemp and wove mats for a living. 301 2. At the same time, Ch'an Hsiang, a disciple of Ch'an Liang, and his younger brother, Hsin, with their plough-handles and shares on their backs, came from Sung to T'ang, saying, 'We have heard that you, Prince, are putting into practice the government of the ancient sages, showing that you are likewise a sage. We wish to become the subjects of a sage.' 302 3. When Ch'an Hsiang saw Hsü Hsing, he was greatly pleased with him, and, abandoning entirely whatever he had learned, became his disciple. Having an interview with Mencius, he related to him with approbation the words of Hsü Hsing to the following effect:-- 'The prince of T'ang is indeed a worthy prince. He has not yet heard, however, the real doctrines of antiquity. Now, wise and able princes should cultivate the ground equally and along with their people, and eat the fruit of their labour. They should prepare their own meals, morning and evening, while at the same time they carry on their government. But now, the prince of T'ang has his granaries, treasuries, and arsenals, which is an oppressing of the people to nourish himself. How can he be deemed a real worthy prince?' 303 4. Mencius said,'I suppose that Hsü Hsing sows grain and eats the produce. Is it not so?' 'It is so,' was the answer. 'I suppose also he weaves cloth, and wears his own manufacture. Is it not so?' 'No. Hsü wears clothes of haircloth.' 'Does he wear a cap?' 'He wears a cap.' 'What kind of cap?' 'A plain cap.' 'Is it woven by himself?' 'No. He gets it in exchange for grain.' 'Why does Hsü not weave it himself?' 'That would injure his husbandry.' 'Does Hsü cook his food in boilers and earthenware pans, and does he plough with an iron share?' 'Yes.' 'Does he make those articles himself?' 'No. He gets them in exchange for grain.' 304 5. Mencius then said, 'The getting those various articles in exchange for grain, is not oppressive to the potter and the founder, and the potter and the founder in their turn, in exchanging their various articles for grain, are not oppressive to the husbandman. How should such a thing be supposed? And moreover, why does not Hsü act the potter and founder, supplying himself with the articles which he uses solely from his own establishment? Why does he go confusedly dealing and exchanging with the handicraftsmen? Why does he not spare himself so much trouble?' Ch'an Hsiang replied, 'The business of the handicraftsman can by no means be carried on along with the business of husbandry.' 305 6. Mencius resumed, 'Then, is it the government of the kingdom which alone can be carried on along with the practice of husbandry?

Vegetation was luxuriant, and birds and beasts swarmed. The various kinds of grain could not be grown. The birds and beasts pressed upon men. The paths marked by the feet of beasts and prints of birds crossed one another throughout the Middle Kingdom. To Yýo alone this caused anxious sorrow. He raised Shun to office, and measures to regulate the disorder were set forth. Shun committed to Yþ the direction of the fire to be employed, and Yþ set fire to, and consumed, the forests and vegetation on the mountains and in the marshes, so that the birds and beasts fled away to hide themselves. Yü separated the nine streams, cleared the courses of the Tsþ and T'ý, and led them all to the sea. He opened a vent also for the Zÿ and Han, and regulated the course of the Hwý'i and Sze, so that they all flowed into the Chiang. When this was done, it became possible for the people of the Middle Kingdom to cultivate the ground and get food for themselves. During that time, Yü was eight years away from his home, and though he thrice passed the door of it, he did not enter. Although he had wished to cultivate the ground, could he have done so?' 307 8. 'The Minister of Agriculture taught the people to sow and reap, cultivating the five kinds of grain. When the five kinds of grain were brought to maturity, the people all obtained a subsistence. But men possess a moral nature; and if they are well fed, warmly clad, and comfortably lodged, without being taught at the same time, they become almost like the beasts. This was a subject of anxious solicitude to the sage Shun, and he appointed Hsieh to be the Minister of Instruction, to teach the relations of humanity:-- how, between father and son, there should be affection; between sovereign and minister, righteousness; between husband and wife, attention to their separate functions; between old and young, a proper order; and between friends, fidelity. The high meritorious sovereign said to him, \"Encourage them; lead them on; rectify them; straighten them; help them; give them wings:-- thus causing them to become possessors of themselves. Then follow this up by stimulating them, and conferring benefits on them.\" When the sages were exercising their solicitude for the people in this way, had they leisure to cultivate the ground? 308 9. 'What Yýo felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Shun. What Shun felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Yü and Kýo Yýo. But he whose anxiety is about his hundred mýu not being properly cultivated, is a mere husbandman. 309 10. 'The imparting by a man to others of his wealth, is called \"kindness.\" The teaching others what is good, is called \"the exercise of fidelity.\" The finding a man who shall benefit the kingdom, is called \"benevolence.\" Hence to give the throne to another man would be easy; to find a man who shall benefit the kingdom is difficult. 310 11.

Pleased with the doctrines of Chýu-kung and Chung-nE, he came northwards to the Middle Kingdom and studied them. Among the scholars of the northern regions, there was perhaps no one who excelled him. He was what you call a scholar of high and distinguished qualities. You and your brother followed him some tens of years, and when your master died, you forthwith turned away from him. 312 13. 'Formerly, when Confucius died, after three vears had elapsed, his disciples collected their baggage, and prepared to return to their several homes. But on entering to take their leave of Tsze-kung, as they looked towards one another, they wailed, till they all lost their voices. After this they returned to their homes, but Tsze-kung went back, and built a house for himself on the altar-ground, where he lived alone other three years, before he returned home. On another occasion, Tsze-hsiý, Tsze-chang, and Tsze-yÿ, thinking that Yÿ Zo resembled the sage, wished to render to him the same observances which they had rendered to Confucius. They tried to force the disciple Tsang to join with them, but he said, \"This may not be done.

So it would be with bundles of hemp and silk, being of the same weight; with the different kinds of grain, being the same in quantity; and with shoes which were of the same size.' 317 18. Mencius replied, 'It is the nature of things to be of unequal quality. Some are twice, some five times, some ten times, some a hundred times, some a thousand times, some ten thousand times as valuable as others.

But if I do not correct his errors, the true principles will not be fully evident. Let me first correct him. I have heard that this ú is a Mohist. Now Mo considers that in the regulation of funeral matters a spare simplicity should be the rule. ú thinks with Mo's doctrines to change the customs of the kingdom;-- how does he regard them as if they were wrong, and not honour them? Notwithstanding his views, ú buried his parents in a sumptuous manner, and so he served them in the way which his doctrines discountenance.' 320 3. The disciple Hsü informed ú of these remarks. ú said, 'Even according to the principles of the learned, we find that the ancients acted towards the people \"as if they were watching over an infant.\" What does this expression mean? To me it sounds that we are to love all without difference of degree; but the manifestation of love must begin with our parents.' Hsü reported this reply to Mencius, who said, 'Now, does ú really think that a man's affection for the child of his brother is merely like his affection for the infant of a neighbour? What is to be approved in that expression is simply this:-- that if an infant crawling about is likely to fall into a well, it is no crime in the infant. Moreover, Heaven gives birth to creatures in such a way that they have one root, and ú makes them to have two roots. This is the cause of his error. 321 4. 'And, in the most ancient times, there were some who did not inter their parents. When their parents died, they took them up and threw them into some water-channel. Afterwards, when passing by them, they saw foxes and wild-cats devouring them, and flies and gnats biting at them. The perspiration started out upon their foreheads, and they looked away, unable to bear the sight. It was not on account of other people that this perspiration flowed. The emotions of their hearts affected their faces and eyes, and instantly they went home, and came back with baskets and spades and covered the bodies.

If now you were once to wait upon them, the result might be so great that you would make one of them sovereign, or, if smaller, that you would make one of them chief of all the other princes. Moreover, the History says, \"By bending only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight.\" It appears to me like a thing which might be done.' 324 2. Mencius said, 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'þ, once when he was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident, Confucius said, \"The determined officer never forgets that his end may be in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose his head.\" What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was not appropriate to him. If one go to see the princes without waiting to be invited, what can be thought of him? 325 3. 'Moreover, that sentence, \"By bending only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight,\" is spoken with reference to the gain that may be got. If gain be the object, then, if it can be got by bending eight cubits to make one cubit straight, may we likewise do that? 326 4. 'Formerly, the officer Chýo Chien made Wang Liang act as charioteer for his favourite Hsþ, when, in the course of a whole day, they did not get a single bird. The favourite Hsþ reported this result, saying, \"He is the poorest charioteer in the world.\" Some one told this to Wang Liang, who said, \"I beg leave to try again.\" By dint of pressing, this was accorded to him, when in one morning they got ten birds. The favourite, reporting this result, said, \"He is the best charioteer in the world.\" Chien said, \"I will make him always drive your chariot for you.\" When he told Wang Liang so, however, Liang refused, saying, \"I drove for him, strictly observing the proper rules for driving, and in the whole day he did not get one bird. I drove for him so as deceitfully to intercept the birds, and in one morning he got ten. It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'There is no failure in the management of their horses; The arrows are discharged surely, like the blows of an axe.' I am not accustomed to drive for a mean man. I beg leave to decline the office.\" 327 5. 'Thus this charioteer even was ashamed to bend improperly to the will of such an archer.

Chýu Hsiýo asked Mencius, saying, 'Did superior men of old time take office?' Mencius replied, 'They did. The Record says, \"If Confucius was three months without being employed by some ruler, he looked anxious and unhappy. When he passed from the boundary of a State, he was sure to carry with him his proper gift of introduction.\" Kung-ming ú said, \"Among the ancients, if an officer was three months unemployed by a ruler, he was condoled with.\"' 331 2. Hsiýo said, 'Did not this condoling, on being three months unemployed by a ruler, show a too great urgency?' 332 3. Mencius answered, 'The loss of his place to an officer is like the loss of his State to a prince. It is said in the Book of Rites, \"A prince ploughs himself, and is assisted by the people, to supply the millet for sacrifice. His wife keeps silkworms, and unwinds their cocoons, to make the garments for sacrifice.\" If the victims be not perfect, the millet not pure, and the dress not complete, he does not presume to sacrifice. \"And the scholar who, out of office, has no holy field, in the same way, does not sacrifice. The victims for slaughter, the vessels, and the garments, not being all complete, he does not presume to sacrifice, and then neither may he dare to feel happy.\" Is there not here sufficient ground also for condolence?' 333 4. Hsiýo again asked, 'What was the meaning of Confucius's always carrying his proper gift of introduction with him, when he passed over the boundaries of the State where he had been?' 334 5. 'An officer's being in office,' was the reply, 'is like the ploughing of a husbandman. Does a husbandman part with his plough, because he goes from one State to another?' 335 6. Hsiýo pursued, 'The kingdom of Tsin is one, as well as others, of official employments, but I have not heard of anyone being thus earnest about being in office. If there should be this urge why does a superior man make any difficulty about taking it?' Mencius answered, 'When a son is born, what is desired for him is that he may have a wife; when a daughter is born, what is desired for her is that she may have a husband. This feeling of the parents is possessed by all men. If the young people, without waiting for the orders of their parents, and the arrangements of the go-betweens, shall bore holes to steal a sight of each other, or get over the wall to be with each other, then their parents and all other people will despise them.

If there be such a proper ground, then Shun's receiving the kingdom from Yýo is not to be considered excessive. Do you think it was excessive?' 337 2.

To carry out the principles which he holds, one must become an earthworm, for so only can it be done. 373 3. 'Now, an earthworm eats the dry mould above, and drinks the yellow spring below.

These are things which cannot be known.' 374 4. 'But,' said Chang, 'what does that matter? He himself weaves sandals of hemp, and his wife twists and dresses threads of hemp to sell or exchange them.' 375 5. Mencius rejoined, 'Chung belongs to an ancient and noble family of Ch'þ. His elder brother Týi received from Ký a revenue of 10,000 chung, but he considered his brother's emolument to be unrighteous, and would not eat of it, and in the same way he considered his brother's house to be unrighteous, and would not dwell in it. Avoiding his brother and leaving his mother, he went and dwelt in Wÿ-ling. One day afterwards, he returned to their house, when it happened that some one sent his brother a present of a live goose. He, knitting his eyebrows, said, \"What are you going to use that cackling thing for?\" By-and-by his mother killed the goose, and gave him some of it to eat. Just then his brother came into the house, and said, \"It is the flesh of that cackling thing,\" upon which he went out and vomited it. 376 6. 'Thus, what his mother gave him he would not eat, but what his wife gives him he eats. He will not dwell in his brother's house, but he dwells in Wÿ-ling.

His disciples said, 'Since our master was treated with so much sincerity and respect, for him to be the first to go away on the arrival of the plunderers, so as to be observed by the people, and then to return on their retiring, appears to us to be improper.'

I asked with whom he ate and drank, and they are all, it seems, wealthy and honourable people. And yet no people of distinction ever come here. I will spy out where our good man goes.' Accordingly, she got up early in the morning, and privately followed wherever her husband went. Throughout the whole city, there was no one who stood or talked with him. At last, he came to those who were sacrificing among the tombs beyond the outer wall on the east, and begged what they had over. Not being satisfied, he looked about, and went to another party;-- and this was the way in which he got himself satiated. His wife returned, and informed the concubine, saying, 'It was to our husband that we looked up in hopeful contemplation, with whom our lot is cast for life;-- and now these are his ways!' On this, along with the concubine she reviled their husband, and they wept together in the middle hall.

Mencius replied, 'He was dissatisfied, and full of earnest desire.' 513 2. Wan Chang said, 'When his parents love him, a son rejoices and forgets them not. When his parents hate him, though they punish him, he does not murmur. Was Shun then murmuring against his parents?' Mencius answered, 'Ch'ang Hsþ asked Kung-ming Kýo, saying, \"As to Shun's going into the fields, I have received your instructions, but I do not know about his weeping and crying out to the pitying heavens and to his parents.\" Kung-ming Kýo answered him, \"You do not understand that matter.\" Now, Kung-ming Kýo supposed that the heart of the filial son could not be so free of sorrow. Shun would say, \"I exert my strength to cultivate the fields, but I am thereby only discharging my office as a son. What can there be in me that my parents do not love me?\" 514 3. 'The Tþ caused his own children, nine sons and two daughters, the various officers, oxen and sheep, storehouses and granaries, all to be prepared, to serve Shun amid the channelled fields. Of the scholars of the kingdom there were multitudes who flocked to him. The sovereign designed that Shun should superintend the kingdom along with him, and then to transfer it to him entirely. But because his parents were not in accord with him, he felt like a poor man who has nowhere to turn to. 515 4. 'To be delighted in by all the scholars of the kingdom, is what men desire, but it was not sufficient to remove the sorrow of Shun. The possession of beauty is what men desire, and Shun had for his wives the two daughters of the Tþ, but this was not sufficient to remove his sorrow. Riches are what men desire, and the kingdom was the rich property of Shun, but this was not sufficient to remove his sorrow. Honours are what men desire, and Shun had the dignity of being sovereign, but this was not sufficient to remove his sorrow. The reason why the being the object of men's delight, with the possession of beauty, riches, and honours were not sufficient to remove his sorrow, was that it could be removed only by his getting his parents to be in accord with him. 516 5.

Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In marrying a wife, how ought a man to proceed? He must inform his parents.\" If the rule be indeed as here expressed, no man ought to have illustrated it so well as Shun. How was it that Shun's marriage took place without his informing his parents?' Mencius replied, 'If he had informed them, he would not have been able to marry. That male and female should dwell together, is the greatest of human relations. If Shun had informed his parents, he must have made void this greatest of human relations, thereby incurring their resentment. On this account, he did not inform them! 518 2. Wan Chang said, 'As to Shun's marrying without informing his parents, I have heard your instructions; but how was it that the Tþ Yýo gave him his daughters as wives without informing Shun's parents?' Mencius said, 'The Tþ also knew that if he informed them, he could not marry his daughters to him.' 519 3. Wan Chang said, 'His parents set Shun to repair a granary, to which, the ladder having been removed, Kÿ-sýu set fire. They also made him dig a well. He got out, but they, not knowing that, proceeded to cover him up. Hsiang said, \"Of the scheme to cover up the city-forming prince, the merit is all mine. Let my parents have his oxen and sheep. Let them have his storehouses and granaries. His shield and spear shall be mine. His lute shall be mine. His bow shall be mine. His two wives I shall make attend for me to my bed.\" Hsiang then went away into Shun's palace, and there was Shun on his couch playing on his lute. Hsiang said, \"I am come simply because I was thinking anxiously about you.\" At the same time, he blushed deeply. Shun said to him, \"There are all my officers:-- do you undertake the government of them for me.\" I do not know whether Shun was ignorant of Hsiang's wishing to kill him.' Mencius answered, 'How could he be ignorant of that? But when Hsiang was sorrowful, he was also sorrowful; when Hsiang was joyful, he was also joyful.' 520 4. Chang said, 'In that case, then, did not Shun rejoice hypocritically?' Mencius replied, 'No. Formerly, some one sent a present of a live fish to Tsze-ch'an of Chang. Tsze-ch'an ordered his pond-keeper to keep it in the pond, but that officer cooked it, and reported the execution of his commission, saying, \"When I first let it go, it embarrassed. In a little while, it seemed to be somewhat at ease, then it swam away joyfully.\" Tsze-ch'an observed, \"It had got into its element! It had got into its element!\" The pond-keeper then went out and said, \"Who calls Tsze-ch'an a wise man? After I had cooked and eaten the fish, he says, \"It had got into its element!

Hsiang came in the way in which the love of his elder brother would have made him come; therefore Shun sincerely believed him, and rejoiced. What hypocrisy was there?' 521 1. Wan Chang said, 'Hsiang made it his daily business to slay Shun. When Shun was made sovereign, how was it that he only banished him?' Mencius said, 'He raised him to be a prince.

Does a benevolent man really act thus? In the case of other men, he cut them off; in the case of his brother, he raised him to be a prince.' Mencius replied, 'A benevolent man does not lay up anger, nor cherish resentment against his brother, but only regards him with affection and love. Regarding him with affection, he wishes him to be honourable: regarding him with love, he wishes him to be rich. The appointment of Hsiang to be the prince of Yÿ-pþ was to enrich and ennoble him. If while Shun himself was sovereign, his brother had been a common man, could he have been said to regard him with affection and love?' 523 3. Wan Chang said, 'I venture to ask what you mean by saying that some supposed that it was a banishing of Hsiang?' Mencius replied, 'Hsiang could do nothing in his State. The Son of Heaven appointed an officer to administer its government, and to pay over its revenues to him. This treatment of him led to its being said that he was banished. How indeed could he be allowed the means of oppressing the people? Nevertheless, Shun wished to be continually seeing him, and by this arrangement, he came incessantly to court, as is signified in that expression-- \"He did not wait for the rendering of tribute, or affairs of government, to receive the prince of Yÿ-pþ. 524 1. Hsien-ch'iÿ Mang asked Mencius, saying, 'There is the saying, \"A scholar of complete virtue may not be employed as a minister by his sovereign, nor treated as a son by his father. Shun stood with his face to the south, and Yýo, at the head of all the princes, appeared before him at court with his face to the north. Kÿ-sýu also did the same. When Shun saw Kÿ-sýu, his countenance became discomposed. Confucius said, At this time, in what a perilous condition was the kingdom! Its state was indeed unsettled.\"-- I do not know whether what is here said really took place.' Mencius replied, 'No. These are not the words of a superior man. They are the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east of Ch'þ. When Yýo was old, Shun was associated with him in the government. It is said in the Canon of Yýo, \"After twenty and eight years, the Highly Meritorious one deceased. The people acted as if they were mourning for a father or mother for three years, and up to the borders of the four seas every sound of music was hushed.\" Confucius said, \"There are not two suns in the sky, nor two sovereigns over the people.\" Shun having been sovereign, and, moreover, leading on all the princes to observe the three years' mourning for Yýo, there would have been in this case two sovereigns.' 525 2. Hsien-ch'iÿ Mang said, 'On the point of Shun's not treating Yýo as a minister, I have received your instructions. But it is said in the Book of Poetry, Under the whole heaven, Every spot is the sovereign's ground; To the borders of the land, Every individual is the sovereign's minister;\" -- and Shun had become sovereign. I venture to ask how it was that Kÿ-sýu was not one of his ministers.' Mencius answered, 'That ode is not to be understood in that way:-- it speaks of being laboriously engaged in the sovereign's business, so as not to be able to nourish one's parents, as if the author said, \"This is all the sovereign's business, and how is it that I alone am supposed to have ability, and am made to toil in it?\" Therefore, those who explain the odes, may not insist on one term so as to do violence to a sentence, nor on a sentence so as to do violence to the general scope. They must try with their thoughts to meet that scope, and then we shall apprehend it. If we simply take single sentences, there is that in the ode called \"The Milky Way,\"-- Of the black-haired people of the remnant of Chýu, There is not half a one left.\" If it had been really as thus expressed, then not an individual of the people of Chýu was left. 526 3.

In this was verified the sentiment in the Book of Poetry, \"Ever cherishing filial thoughts, Those filial thoughts became an example to after ages.\" 527 4. 'It is said in the Book of History, \"Reverently performing his duties, he waited on Kÿ-sýu, and was full of veneration and awe.

'Yes;-- but Shun had the throne. Who gave it to him?' 'Heaven gave it to him,' was the answer. 530 3. '\" Heaven gave it to him:\"-- did Heaven confer its appointment on him with specific injunctions?' 531 4. Mencius replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.' 532 5. '\"It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs:\"-- how was this?' Mencius's answer was, 'The sovereign can present a man to Heaven, but he cannot make Heaven give that man the throne. A prince can present a man to the sovereign, but he cannot cause the sovereign to make that man a prince. A great officer can present a man to his prince, but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great officer. Yýo presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him. He presented him to the people, and the people accepted him. Therefore I say, \"Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.\"' 533 6. Chang said, 'I presume to ask how it was that Yýo presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; and that he exhibited him to the people, and the people accepted him.'

'Shun assisted Yýo in the government for twenty and eight years;-- this was more than man could have done, and was from Heaven. After the death of Yýo, when the three years' mourning was completed, Shun withdrew from the son of Yýo to the south of South river. The princes of the kingdom, however, repairing to court, went not to the son of Yýo, but they went to Shun. Litigants went not to the son of Yýo, but they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Yýo, but they sang Shun. Therefore I said, \"Heaven gave him the throne.\" It was after these things that he went to the Middle Kingdom, and occupied the seat of the Son of Heaven. If he had, before these things, taken up his residence in the palace of Yýo, and had applied pressure to the son of Yýo, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the gift of Heaven. 535 8. 'This sentiment is expressed in the words of The Great Declaration,-- \"Heaven sees according as my people see; Heaven hears according as my people hear.\"' 536 1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, \"When the disposal of the kingdom came to Yü, his virtue was inferior to that of Yýo and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son.\" Was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. Shun presented Yü to Heaven. Seventeen years elapsed, and Shun died. When the three years' mourning was expired, Yü withdrew from the son of Shun to Yang-ch'ang. The people of the kingdom followed him just as after the death of Yýo, instead of following his son, they had followed Shun. Yü presented Yþ to Heaven. Seven years elapsed, and Yü died. When the three years' mourning was expired, Yþ withdrew from the son of Yü to the north of mount Ch'þ. The princes, repairing to court, went not to Yþ, but they went to Ch'þ. Litigants did not go to Yþ, but they went to Ch'þ, saying, \"He is the son of our sovereign;\" the singers did not sing Yþ, but they sang Ch'þ, saying, \"He is the son of our sovereign.\" 537 2. 'That Tan-chÿ was not equal to his father, and Shun's son not equal to his; that Shun assisted Yýo, and Yü assisted Shun, for many years, conferring benefits on the people for a long time; that thus the length of time during which Shun, Yü, and Yþ assisted in the government was so different; that Ch'þ was able, as a man of talents and virtue, reverently to pursue the same course as Yü; that Yþ assisted Yü only for a few years, and had not long conferred benefits on the people; that the periods of service of the three were so different; and that the sons were one superior, and the other superior:-- all this was from Heaven, and what could not be brought about by man.

Was it so?' 544 2. Mencius replied, 'No, it was not so. ú Yin was a farmer in the lands of the prince of Hsin, delighting in the principles of Yýo and Shun. In any matter contrary to the righteousness which they prescribed, or contrary to their principles, though he had been offered the throne, he would not have regarded it; though there had been yoked for him a thousand teams of horses, he would not have looked at them. In any matter contrary to the righteousness which they prescribed, or contrary to their principles, he would neither have given nor taken a single straw. 545 3. 'T'ang sent persons with presents of silk to entreat him to enter his service. With an air of indifference and self-satisfaction he said, \"What can I do with those silks with which T'ang invites me? Is it not best for me to abide in the channelled fields, and so delight myself with the principles of Yýo and Shun?\" 546 4. 'T'ang thrice sent messengers to invite him. After this, with the change of resolution displayed in his countenance, he spoke in a different style,-- \"Instead of abiding in the channelled fields and thereby delighting myself with the principles of Yýo and Shun, had I not better make this prince a prince like Yýo or Shun, and this people like the people of Yýo or Shun ? Had I not better in my own person see these things for myself? 547 5.

He took upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom in this way, and therefore he went to T'ang, and pressed upon him the subject of attacking Hsiý and saving the people. 549 7. 'I have not heard of one who bent himself, and at the same time made others straight;-- how much less could one disgrace himself, and thereby rectify the whole kingdom? The actions of the sages have been different. Some have kept remote from court, and some have drawn near to it; some have left their offices, and some have not done so:-- that to which those different courses all agree is simply the keeping of their persons pure. 550 8. 'I have heard that ú Yin sought an introduction to T'ang by the doctrines of Yýo and Shun. I have not heard that he did so by his knowledge of cookery. 551 9.

Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Some say that Confucius, when he was in Wei, lived with the ulcer-doctor, and when he was in Ch'þ, with the attendant, Ch'þ Hwan;-- was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. Those are the inventions of men fond of strange things. 553 2. 'When he was in Wei, he lived with Yen Ch'ýu-yÿ. The wives of the officer Mþ and Tsze-lÿ were sisters, and Mþ told Tsze-lÿ, \"If Confucius will lodge with me, he may attain to the dignity of a high noble of Wei.\" Tsze-lÿ informed Confucius of this, and he said, \"That is as ordered by Heaven.\" Confucius went into office according to propriety, and retired from it according to righteousness. In regard to his obtaining office or not obtaining it, he said, \"That is as ordered.\" But if he had lodged with the attendant Chþ Hwan, that would neither have been according to righteousness, nor any ordering of Heaven. 554 3. 'When Confucius, being dissatisfied in Lÿ and Wei, had left those States, he met with the attempt of Hwan, the Master of the Horse, of Sung, to intercept and kill him. He assumed, however, the dress of a common man, and passed by Sung. At that time, though he was in circumstances of distress, he lodged with the city-master Ch'ang, who was then a minister of Chýu, the marquis of Ch'an. 555 4.

Wan Chang asked Mencius, 'Some say that Pýi-lþ Hsþ sold himself to a cattle-keeper of Ch'in for the skins of five rams, and fed his oxen, in order to find an introduction to the duke Mÿ of Ch'in;-- was this the case?' Mencius said, 'No; it was not so. This story was invented by men fond of strange things. 557 2. 'Pýi-lþ Hsþ was a man of Yü. The people of Tsin, by the inducement of a round piece of jade from Ch'ÿi-chþ, and four horses of the Ch'ü breed, borrowed a passage through Yü to attack Kwo. On that occasion, Kung Chih-ch'þ remonstrated against granting their request, and Pýi-lþ Hsþ did not remonstrate. 558 3. 'When he knew that the duke of Yü was not to be remonstrated with, and, leaving that State, went to Ch'in, he had reached the age of seventy. If by that time he did not know that it would be a mean thing to seek an introduction to the duke Mÿ of Ch'in by feeding oxen, could he be called wise? But not remonstrating where it was of no use to remonstrate, could he be said not to be wise? Knowing that the duke of Yü would be ruined, and leaving him before that event, he cannot be said not to have been wise. Being then advanced in Ch'in, he knew that the duke Mÿ was one with whom he would enjoy a field for action, and became minister to him;-- could he, acting thus, be said not to be wise? Having become chief minister of Ch'in, he made his prince distinguished throughout the kingdom, and worthy of being handed down to future ages;-- could he have done this, if he had not been a man of talents and virtue? As to selling himself in order to accomplish all the aims of his prince, even a villager who had a regard for himself would not do such a thing; and shall we say that a man of talents and virtue did it?' Mencius : Chapter 18 Mencius : Chapter 19 559 1. Mencius said, 'Po-þ would not allow his eyes to look on a bad sight, nor his ears to listen to a bad sound. He would not serve a prince whom he did not approve, nor command a people whom he did not esteem. In a time of good government he took office, and on the occurrence of confusion he retired. He could not bear to dwell either in a court from which a lawless government emanated, or among lawless people. He considered his being in the same place with a villager, as if he were to sit amid mud and coals with his court robes and court cap. In the time of Chýu he dwelt on the shores of the North sea, waiting the purification of the kingdom. Therefore when men now hear the character of Po-þ, the corrupt become pure, and the weak acquire determination. 560 2. 'ú Yin said, \"Whom may I not serve? My serving him makes him my sovereign.

'Hÿi of Liÿ-hsiý was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out his principles. When dismissed and left without office, he did not murmur. When straitened by poverty, he did not grieve. When thrown into the company of village people, he was quite at ease and could not bear to leave them. He had a saying, \"You are you, and I am I. Although you stand by my side with breast and arms bare, or with your body naked, how can you defile me?\" Therefore when men now hear the character of Hÿi of Liü-hsiý, the mean become generous, and the niggardly become liberal. 562 4. 'When Confucius was leaving Ch'þ, he strained off with his hand the water in which his rice was being rinsed, took the rice, and went away. When he left Lÿ, he said, \"I will set out by-and-by:\"-- it was right he should leave the country of his parents in this way. When it was proper to go away quickly, he did so; when it was proper to delay, he did so; when it was proper to keep in retirement, he did so; when it was proper to go into office, he did so:-- this was Confucius.' 563 5. Mencius said,'Po-þ among the sages was the pure one; ú Yin was the one most inclined to take office; Hÿi of Liÿ-hsiý was the accommodating one; and Confucius was the timeous one. 564 6. 'In Confucius we have what is called a complete concert. A complete concert is when the large bell proclaims the commencement of the music, and the ringing stone proclaims its close. The metal sound commences the blended harmony of all the instruments, and the winding up with the stone terminates that blended harmony. The commencing that harmony is the work of wisdom. The terminating it is the work of sageness. 565 7. 'As a comparison for wisdom, we may liken it to skill, and as a comparison for sageness, we may liken it to strength;-- as in the case of shooting at a mark a hundred paces distant. That you reach it is owing to your strength, but that you hit the mark is not owing to your strength.' 566 1.

Friendship with a man is friendship with his virtue, and does not admit of assumptions of superiority. 576 2. 'There was Mang Hsien, chief of a family of a hundred chariots. He had five friends, namely, Yo-chang Chiÿ, Mÿ Chung, and three others whose names I have forgotten. With those five men Hsien maintained a friendship, because they thought nothing about his family. If they had thought about his family, he would not have maintained his friendship with them. 577 3. 'Not only has the chief of a family of a hundred chariots acted thus. The same thing was exemplified by the sovereign of a small State. The duke Hÿi of Pþ said, \"I treat Tsze-sze as my Teacher, and Yen Pan as my Friend. As to Wang Shun and Ch'ang Hsþ, they serve me.\" 578 4. 'Not only has the sovereign of a small State acted thus. The same thing has been exemplified by the sovereign of a large State. There was the duke P'ing of Tsin with Hýi T'ang:-- when T'ang told him to come into his house, he came; when he told him to be seated, he sat; when he told him to eat, he ate. There might only be coarse rice and soup of vegetables, but he always ate his fill, not daring to do otherwise. Here, however, he stopped, and went no farther. He did not call him to share any of Heaven's places, or to govern any of Heaven's offices, or to partake of any of Heaven's emoluments. His conduct was but a scholar's honouring virtue and talents, not the honouring them proper to a king or a duke. 579 5. 'Shun went up to court and saw the sovereign, who lodged him as his son-in-law in the second palace. The sovereign also enjoyed there Shun's hospitality. Alternately he was host and guest. Here was the sovereign maintaining friendship with a private man. 580 6. Respect shown by inferiors to superiors is called giving to the noble the observance due to rank. Respect shown by superiors to inferiors is called giving honour to talents and virtue. The rightness in each case is the same.' 581 1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'I venture to ask what feeling of the mind is expressed in the presents of friendship?' Mencius replied, 'The feeling of respect.' 582 2. 'How is it,' pursued Chang, 'that the declining a present is accounted disrespectful?' The answer was, 'When one of honourable rank presents a gift, to say in the mind, \"Was the way in which he got this righteous or not? I must know this before I can receive it;\"-- this is deemed disrespectful, and therefore presents are not declined.' 583 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"3. Wan Chang asked again, 'When one does not take on him in so many express words to refuse the gift, but having declined it in his heart, saying, \"It was taken by him unrighteously from the people,\" and then assigns some other reason for not receiving it;-- is not this a proper course?' Mencius said, 'When the donor offers it on a ground of reason, and his manner of doing so is according to propriety;-- in such a case Confucius would have received it.' 584 4. Wan Chang said, 'Here now is one who stops and robs people outside the gates of the city. He offers his gift on a ground of reason, and does so in a manner according to propriety;-- would the reception of it so acquired by robbery be proper?' Mencius replied, 'It would not be proper. in \"The Announcement to Kang\" it is said, \"When men kill others, and roll over their bodies to take their property, being reckless and fearless of death, among all the people there are none but detest them:\"-- thus, such characters are to be put to death, without waiting to give them warning. Yin received this rule from Hsiý and Chýu received it from Yin. It cannot be questioned, and to the present day is clearly acknowledged. How can the grift of a robber be received?' 585 5. Chang said, 'The princes of the present day take from their people just as a robber despoils his victim. Yet if they put a good face of propriety on their gifts, then the superior man receives them. I venture to ask how you explain this.' Mencius answered, 'Do you think that, if there should arise a truly royal sovereign, he would collect the princes of the present day, and put them all to death? Or would he admonish them, and then, on their not changing their ways, put them to death? Indeed, to call every one who takes what does not properly belong to him a robber, is pushing a point of resemblance to the utmost, and insisting on the most refined idea of righteousness. When Confucius was in office in Lÿ, the people struggled together for the game taken in hunting, and he also did the same. If that struggling for the captured game was proper, how much more may the gifts of the princes be received!' 586 6. Chang urged, 'Then are we to suppose that when Confucius held office, it was not with the view to carry his doctrines into practice?' 'It was with that view,' Mencius replied, and Chang rejoined, 'If the practice of his doctrines was his business, what had he to do with that struggling for the captured game?' Mencius said, 'Confucius first rectified his vessels of sacrifice according to the registers, and did not fill them so rectified with food gathered from every quarter.' 'But why did he not go away?' He wished to make a trial of carrying his doctrines into practice. When that trial was sufficient to show that they could be practised and they were still not practised, then he went away, and thus it was that he never completed in any State a residence of three years. 587 7. 'Confucius took office when he saw that the practice of his doctrines was likely; he took office when his reception was proper; he took office when he was supported by the State. In the case of his relation to Chþ Hwan, he took office, seeing that the practice of his doctrines was likely. With the duke Ling of Wei he took office, because his reception was proper.

Wan Chang said, 'What is the reason that a scholar does not accept a stated support from a prince?' Mencius replied, 'He does not presume to do so. When a prince loses his State, and then accepts a stated support from another prince, this is in accordance with propriety. But for a scholar to accept such support from any of the princes is not in accordance with propriety.' 594 2. Wan Chang said, 'If the prince send him a present of grain, for instance, does he accept it?' 'He accepts it,' answered Mencius. 'On what principle of righteousness does he accept it?' 'Why-- the prince ought to assist the people in their necessities.' 595 3. Chang pursued, 'Why is it that the scholar will thus accept the prince's help, but will not accept his pay?' The answer was, 'He does not presume to do so.' 'I venture to ask why he does not presume to do so.' 'Even the keepers of the gates, with their watchmen's sticks, have their regular offices for which they can take their support from the prince. He who without a regular office should receive the pay of the prince must be deemed disrespectful.' 596 4. Chang asked, 'If the prince sends a scholar a present, he accepts it;-- I do not know whether this present may be constantly repeated.'

Tsze-sze was displeased; and at length, having motioned to the messenger to go outside the great door, he bowed his head to the ground with his face to the north, did obeisance twice, and declined the gift, saying, \"From this time forth I shall know that the prince supports me as a dog or a horse.\" And so from that time a servant was no more sent with the presents. When a prince professes to be pleased with a man of talents and virtue, and can neither promote him to office, nor support him in the proper way, can he be said to be pleased with him? 597 5. Chang said, 'I venture to ask how the sovereign of a State, when he wishes to support a superior man, must proceed, that he may be said to do so in the proper way?' Mencius answered, 'At first, the present must be offered with the prince's commission, and the scholar, making obeisance twice with his head bowed to the ground, will receive it. But after this the storekeeper will continue to send grain, and the master of the kitchen to send meat, presenting it as if without the prince's express commission. Tsze-sze considered that the meat from the prince's caldron, giving him the annoyance of constantly doing obeisance, was not the way to support a superior man. 598 6. 'There was Yýo's conduct to Shun:-- He caused his nine sons to serve him, and gave him his two daughters in marriage; he caused the various officers, oxen and sheep, storehouses and granaries, all to be prepared to support Shun amid the channelled fields, and then he raised him to the most exalted situation. From this we have the expression-- \"The honouring of virtue and talents proper to a king or a duke.\"' 599 1. Wan Chang said, 'I venture to ask what principle of righteousness is involved in a scholar's not going to see the princes?' Mencius replied, 'A scholar residing in the city is called \"a minister of the market-place and well,\" and one residing in the country is called \"a minister of the grass and plants.\" In both cases he is a common man, and it is the rule of propriety that common men, who have not presented the introductory present and become ministers, should not presume to have interviews with the prince.' 600 2. Wan Chang said, 'If a common man is called to perform any service, he goes and performs it;-- how is it that a scholar, when the prince, wishing to see him, calls him to his presence, refuses to go?' Mencius replied, 'It is right to go and perform the service; it would not be right to go and see the prince.' 601 3. 'And,' added Mencius, 'on what account is it that the prince wishes to see the scholar?' 'Because of his extensive information, or because of his talents and virtue,' was the reply. 'If because of his extensive information,' said Mencius, 'such a person is a teacher, and the sovereign would not call him;-- how much less may any of the princes do so? If because of his talents and virtue, then I have not heard of any one wishing to see a person with those qualities, and calling him to his presence. 602 4. 'During the frequent interviews of the duke Mÿ with Tsze-sze, he one day said to him, \"Anciently, princes of a thousand chariots have yet been on terms of friendship with scholars;-- what do you think of such an intercourse?\" Tsze-sze was displeased, and said, \"The ancients have said, 'The scholar should be served:' how should they have merely said that he should be made a friend of?\" When Tsze-sze was thus displeased, did he not say within himself,-- Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"\"With regard to our stations, you are sovereign, and I am subject.

'The duke Ching of Ch'þ, once, when he was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident, Confucius said, \"The determined officer never forgets that his end may be in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose his head.\" What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was not appropriate to him.' 604 6. Chang said, 'May I ask with what a forester should be summoned?' Mencius replied, 'With a skin cap. A common man should be summoned with a plain banner; a scholar who has taken office, with one having dragons embroidered on it; and a Great officer, with one having feathers suspended from the top of the staff. 605 7. 'When the forester was summoned with the article appropriate to the summoning of a Great officer, he would have died rather than presume to go. If a common man were summoned with the article appropriate to the summoning of a scholar, how could he presume to go? How much more may we expect this refusal to go, when a man of talents and virtue is summoned in a way which is inappropriate to his character! 606 8. 'When a prince wishes to see a man of talents and virtue, and does not take the proper course to get his wish, it is as if he wished him to enter his palace, and shut the door against him. Now, righteousness is the way, and propriety is the door, but it is only the superior man who can follow this way, and go out and in by this door. It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The way to Chýu is level like a whetstone, And straight as an arrow. The officers tread it, And the lower people see it.\"' 607 9. Wan Chang said, 'When Confucius received the prince's message calling him, he went without waiting for his carriage. Doing so, did Confucius do wrong?' Mencius replied, 'Confucius was in office, and had to observe its appropriate duties. And moreover, he was summoned on the business of his office.' 608 1. Mencius said to Wan Chang, 'The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished in a village shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars in the village. The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished throughout a State shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars of that State. The scholar whose virtue is most distinguished throughout the kingdom shall make friends of all the virtuous scholars of the kingdom. 609 2. 'When a scholar feels that his friendship with all the virtuous scholars of the kingdom is not sufficient to satisfy him, he proceeds to ascend to consider the men of antiquity.

The king Hsüan of Ch'þ asked about the office of high ministers. Mencius said, 'Which high ministers is your Majesty asking about?' 'Are there differences among them?' inquired the king. 'There are' was the reply. 'There are the high ministers who are noble and relatives of the prince, and there are those who are of a different surname.' The king said, 'I beg to ask about the high ministers who are noble and relatives of the prince.' Mencius answered, 'If the prince have great faults, they ought to remonstrate with him, and if he do not listen to them after they have done so again and again, they ought to dethrone him.' 611 2. The king on this looked moved, and changed countenance. 612 3. Mencius said, 'Let not your Majesty be offended. You asked me, and I dare not answer but according to truth.' 613 4. The king's countenance became composed, and he then begged to ask about high ministers who were of a different surname from the prince. Mencius said, 'When the prince has faults, they ought to remonstrate with him; and if he do not listen to them after they have done this again and again, they ought to leave the State.' Mencius : Chapter 20 Mencius : Chapter 21 614 1. The philosopher Kýo said, 'Man's nature is like the ch'þ-willow , and righteousness is like a cup or a bowl. The fashioning benevolence and righteousness out of man's nature is like the making cups and bowls from the ch'þ-willow.' 615 2. Mencius replied, 'Can you, leaving untouched the nature of the willow, make with it cups and bowls? You must do violence and injury to the willow, before you can make cups and bowls with it. If you must do violence and injury to the willow in order to make cups and bowls with it, on your principles you must in the same way do violence and injury to humanity in order to fashion from it benevolence and righteousness! Your words, alas! would certainly lead all men on to reckon benevolence and righteousness to be calamities.' 616 1. The philosopher Kýo said, 'Man's nature is like water whirling round in a corner. Open a passage for it to the east, and it will flow to the east; open a passage for it to the west, and it will flow to the west. Man's nature is indifferent to good and evil, just as the water is indifferent to the east and west.' Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"617 2. Mencius replied, 'Water indeed will flow indifferently to the east or west, but will it flow indifferently up or down?

'Now by striking water and causing it to leap up, you may make it go over your forehead, and, by damming and leading it you may force it up a hill;-- but are such movements according to the nature of water? It is the force applied which causes them. When men are made to do what is not good, their nature is dealt with in this way.' 619 1. The philosopher Kýo said, 'Life is what we call nature!' 620 2. Mencius asked him, 'Do you say that by nature you mean life, just as you say that white is white?' 'Yes, I do,' was the reply. Mencius added, 'Is the whiteness of a white feather like that of white snow, and the whiteness of white snow like that of white jade?' Kýo again said 'Yes.' 621 3. 'Very well,' pursued Mencius. 'Is the nature of a dog like the nature of an ox, and the nature of an ox like the nature of a man?' 622 1. The philosopher Kýo said, 'To enjoy food and delight in colours is nature. Benevolence is internal and not external; righteousness is external and not internal.' 623 2. Mencius asked him, 'What is the ground of your saying that benevolence is internal and righteousness external?' He replied, 'There is a man older than I, and I give honour to his age. It is not that there is first in me a principle of such reverence to age. It is just as when there is a white man, and I consider him white; according as he is so externally to me. On this account, I pronounce of righteousness that it is external.' 624 3. Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness?-- the fact of a man's being old? or the fact of our giving honour to his age?' 625 4. Kýo said, 'There is my younger brother;-- I love him. But the younger brother of a man of Ch'in I do not love: that is, the feeling is determined by myself, and therefore I say that benevolence is internal. On the other hand, I give honour to an old man of Ch'ÿ, and I also give honour to an old man of my own people: that is, the feeling is determined by the age, and therefore I say that righteousness is external.'

Mencius answered him, 'Our enjoyment of meat roasted by a man of Ch'in does not differ from our enjoyment of meat roasted by ourselves. Thus, what you insist on takes place also in the case of such things, and will you say likewise that our enjoyment of a roast is external?' 627 1. The disciple Mang Chþ asked Kung-tÿ, saying, 'On what ground is it said that righteousness is internal?' 628 2. Kung-tÿ replied, 'We therein act out our feeling of respect, and therefore it is said to be internal.' 629 3. The other objected, 'Suppose the case of a villager older than your elder brother by one year, to which of them would you show the greater respect?' 'To my brother,' was the reply. 'But for which of them would you first pour out wine at a feast?' 'For the villager.' Mang Chþ argued, 'Now your feeling of reverence rests on the one, and now the honour due to age is rendered to the other;-- this is certainly determined by what is without, and does not proceed from within.' 630 4. Kung-tÿ was unable to reply, and told the conversation to Mencius. Mencius said, 'You should ask him, \"Which do you respect most,-- your uncle, or your younger brother?\" He will answer, \"My uncle.\" Ask him again, \"If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect,-- to him or to your uncle?\" He will say, \"To my younger brother.\" You can go on, \"But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?\" He will reply to this, \"I show the respect to my younger brother, because of the position which he occupies,\" and you can likewise say, \"So my respect to the villager is because of the position which he occupies. Ordinarily, my respect is rendered to my elder brother; for a brief season, on occasion, it is rendered to the villager.\"' 631 5. Mang Chþ heard this and observed, 'When respect is due to my uncle, I respect him, and when respect is due to my younger brother, I respect him;-- the thing is certainly determined by what is without, and does not proceed from within.' Kung-tÿ replied, 'In winter we drink things hot, in summer we drink things cold; and so, on your principle, eating and drinking also depend on what is external!' 632 1. The disciple Kung-tÿ said, 'The philosopher Kýo says, \"Man's nature is neither good nor bad.\" 633 2. 'Some say, \"Man's nature may be made to practise good, and it may be made to practise evil, and accordingly, under Wan and Wÿ, the people loved what was good, while under Yÿ and Lþ, they loved what was cruel.\" 634 3.

This is what I mean in saying that the nature is good. 637 6. 'If men do what is not good, the blame cannot be imputed to their natural powers. 638 7. 'The feeling of commiseration belongs to all men; so does that of shame and dislike; and that of reverence and respect; and that of approving and disapproving. The feeling of commiseration implies the principle of benevolence; that of shame and dislike, the principle of righteousness; that of reverence and respect, the principle of propriety; and that of approving and disapproving, the principle of knowledge. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and knowledge are not infused into us from without. We are certainly furnished with them. And a different view is simply owing to want of reflection. Hence it is said, \"Seek and you will find them. Neglect and you will lose them.\" Men differ from one another in regard to them;-- some as much again as others, some five times as much, and some to an incalculable amount:-- it is because they cannot carry out fully their natural powers. 639 8. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Heaven in producing mankind, Gave them their various faculties and relations with their specific laws. These are the invariable rules of nature for all to hold, And all love this admirable virtue.\" Confucius said, \"The maker of this ode knew indeed the principle of our nature!\" We may thus see that every faculty and relation must have its law, and since there are invariable rules for all to hold, they consequently love this admirable virtue.' 640 1. Mencius said, 'In good years the children of the people are most of them good, while in bad years the most of them abandon themselves to evil. It is not owing to any difference of their natural powers conferred by Heaven that they are thus different. The abandonment is owing to the circumstances through which they allow their minds to be ensnared and drowned in evil. 641 2. 'There now is barley.-- Let it be sown and covered up; the ground being the same, and the time of sowing likewise the same, it grows rapidly up, and, when the full time is come, it is all found to be ripe.

'So with the mouth and flavours;-- all mouths have the same relishes. Yþ-yý only apprehended before me what my mouth relishes. Suppose that his mouth in its relish for flavours differed from that of other men, as is the case with dogs or horses which are not the same in kind with us, why should all men be found following Yþ-yý in their relishes? In the matter of tastes all the people model themselves after Yþ-yý; that is, the mouths of all men are like one another. 645 6. 'And so also it is with the ear. In the matter of sounds, the whole people model themselves after the music-master K'wang; that is, the ears of all men are like one another. 646 7. 'And so also it is with the eye. In the case of Tsze-tÿ, there is no man but would recognise that he was beautiful. Any one who would not recognise the beauty of Tsze-tÿ must have no eyes. 647 8. 'Therefore I say,-- Men's mouths agree in having the same relishes; their ears agree in enjoying the same sounds; their eyes agree in recognising the same beauty:-- shall their minds alone be without that which the similarly approve? What is it then of which they similarly approve? It is, I say, the principles of our nature, and the determinations of righteousness. The sages only apprehended before me that of which my mind approves along with other men. Therefore the principles of our nature and the determinations of righteousness are agreeable to my mind, just as the flesh of grass and grain-fed animals is agreeable to my mouth.' 648 1. Mencius said, 'The trees of the Niÿ mountain were once beautiful. Being situated, however, in the borders of a large State, they were hewn down with axes and bills;-- and could they retain their beauty? Still through the activity of the vegetative life day and night, and the nourishing influence of the rain and dew, they were not without buds and sprouts springing forth, but then came the cattle and goats and browsed upon them. To these things is owing the bare and stripped appearance of the mountain, and when people now see it, they think it was never finely wooded. But is this the nature of the mountain? 649 2. 'And so also of what properly belongs to man;-- shall it be said that the mind of any man was without benevolence and righteousness? The way in which a man loses his proper goodness of mind is like the way in which the trees are denuded by axes and bills. Hewn down day after day, can it-- the mind-- retain its beauty? But there is a development of its life day and night, and in the calm air of the morning, just between night and day, the mind feels in a degree those desires and aversions which are proper to humanity, but the feeling is not strong, and it is fettered and destroyed by what takes place during the day. This fettering taking place again and again, the restorative influence of the night is not sufficient to preserve the proper goodness of the mind; and when this proves insufficient for that purpose, the nature becomes not much different from that of the irrational animals, and when people now see it, they think that it never had those powers which I assert.

Subsequently, going from Tsýu to Zan, he visited the guardian; but when he went from Ping-lÿ to the capital of Ch'þ, he did not visit the minister Ch'ÿ. The disciple Wÿ-lÿ was glad, and said, 'I have got an opportunity to obtain some instruction.' 712 3. He asked accordingly, 'Master, when you went to Zan, you visited the chief's brother; and when you went to Ch'þ, you did not visit Ch'ÿ. Was it not because he is only the minister?' 713 4. Mencius replied, 'No. It is said in the Book of History, \"In presenting an offering to a superior, most depends on the demonstrations of respect. If those demonstrations are not equal to the things offeredred, we say there is no offering, that is, there is no act of the will presenting the offering.\" 714 5. 'This is because the things so offered do not constitute an offering to a superior.' 715 6. Wÿ-lÿ was pleased, and when some one asked him what Mencius meant, he said, 'The younger of Zan could not go to Tsýu, but the minister Ch'ÿ might have gone to P'ing-lÿ.' 716 1. Shun-yü K'wan said, 'He who makes fame and meritorious services his first objects, acts with a regard to others. He who makes them only secondary objects, acts with a regard to himself. You, master, were ranked among the three chief ministers of the State, but before your fame and services had reached either to the prince or the people, you have left your place. Is this indeed the way of the benevolent?' 717 2. Mencius replied, 'There was Po'þ;-- he abode in an inferior situation, and would not, with his virtue, serve a degenerate prince. There was ú Yin;-- he five times went to T'ang, and five times went to Chieh. There was Hÿi of Liÿ-hsiý;-- he did not disdain to serve a vile prince, nor did he decline a small office.

We must answer-- \"To be perfectly virtuous.\" And so it is simply after this that superior men strive. Why must they all pursue the same course?' 718 3. K'wan pursued, 'In the time of the duke Mÿ of Lÿ, the government was in the hands of Kung-þ, while Tsze-liÿ and Tsze-sze were ministers. And yet, the dismemberment of Lÿ then increased exceedingly. Such was the case, a specimen how your men of virtue are of no advantage to a kingdom!' 719 4. Mencius said, 'The prince of Yü did not use Pýi-lþ Hsi, and thereby lost his State. The duke Mÿ of Chin used him, and became chief of all the princes. Ruin is the consequence of not employing men of virtue and talents;-- how can it rest with dismemberment merely?' 720 5. K'wan urged again, 'Formerly, when Wang P'ýo dwelt on the Ch'þ, the people on the west of the Yellow River all became skilful at singing in his abrupt manner. When Mien Ch'ü lived in Kýo-t'ang, the people in the parts of Ch'þ on the west became skilful at singing in his prolonged manner. The wives of Hwa Chýu and Ch'þ Liang bewailed their husbands so skilfully, that they changed the manners of the State. When there is the gift within, it manifests itself without. I have never seen the man who could do the deeds of a worthy, and did not realize the work of one. Therefore there are now no men of talents and virtue. If there were, I should know them.' 721 6. Mencius answered, 'When Confucius was chief minister of Justice in Lÿ, the prince came not to follow his counsels. Soon after there was the solstitial sacrifice, and when a part of the flesh presented in sacrifice was not sent to him, he went away even without taking off his cap of ceremony. Those who did not know him supposed it was on account of the flesh. Those who knew him supposed that it was on account of the neglect of the usual ceremony. The fact was, that Confucius wanted to go away on occasion of some small offence, not wishing to do so without some apparent cause. All men cannot be expected to understand the conduct of a superior man.' Mencius : Chapter 23 Mencius : Chapter 24 722 1. Mencius said, 'The five chiefs of the princes were sinners against the three kings. The princes of the present day are sinners against the five chiefs. The Great officers of the present day are sinners against the princes. 723 2. 'The sovereign visited the princes, which was called \"A tour of Inspection.\" The princes attended at the court of the sovereign, which was called \"Giving a report of office.\" It was a custom in the spring to examine the ploughing, and supply any deficiency of seed; and in autumn to examine the reaping, and assist where there was a deficiency of the Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"crop. When the sovereign entered the boundaries of a State, if the new ground was being reclaimed, and the old fields well cultivated; if the old were nourished and the worthy honoured; and if men of distinguished talents were placed in office: then the prince was rewarded,-- rewarded with an addition to his territory. On the other hand, if, on entering a State, the ground was found left wild or overrun with weeds; if the old were neglected and the worthy unhonoured; and if the offices were filled with hard taxgatherers: then the prince was reprimanded. If a prince once omitted his attendance at court, he was punished by degradation of rank; if he did so a second time, be was deprived of a portion of his territory; if he did so a third time, the royal forces were set in motion, and he was removed from his government. Thus the sovereign commanded the punishment, but did not himself inflict it, while the princes inflicted the punishment, but did not command it. The five chiefs, however, dragged the princes to punish other princes, and hence I say that they were sinners against the three kings. 724 3. 'Of the five chiefs the most powerful was the duke Hwan. At the assembly of the princes in K'wei-ch'iÿ, he bound the victim and placed the writing upon it, but did not slay it to smear their mouths with the blood. The first injunction in their agreement was,-- \"Slay the unfilial; change not the son who has been appointed heir; exalt not a concubine to be the wife.\" The second was,-- \"Honour the worthy, and maintain the talented, to give distinction to the virtuous.\" The third was,-- \"Respect the old, and be kind to the young. Be not forgetful of strangers and travellers.\" The fourth was, \"Let not offices be hereditary, nor let officers be pluralists. In the selection of officers let the object be to get the proper men. Let not a ruler take it on himself to put to death a Great officer.\" The fifth was,-- \"Follow no crooked policy in making embankments. Impose no restrictions on the sale of grain. Let there be no promotions without first announcing them to the sovereign.\" It was then said, \"All we who have united in this agreement shall hereafter maintain amicable relations.\" The princes of the present day all violate these five prohibitions, and therefore I say that the princes of the present day are sinners against the five chiefs. 725 4. 'The crime of him who connives at, and aids, the wickedness of his prince is small, but the crime of him who anticipates and excites that wickedness is great. The officers of the present day all go to meet their sovereigns' wickedness, and therefore I say that the Great officers of the present day are sinners against the princes.' 726 1. The prince of Lÿ wanted to make the minister Shan commander of his army. 727 2. Mencius said, 'To employ an uninstructed people in war may be said to be destroying the people. A destroyer of the people would not have been tolerated in the times of Yýo and Shun. 728 3. 'Though by a single battle you should subdue Ch'þ, and get possession of Nan-yang, the thing ought not to be done.' 729 4. Shan changed countenance, and said in displeasure, 'This is what I, Kÿ-Lþ, do not understand.' 730 5. Mencius said, 'I will lay the case plainly before you.

'The way in which a superior man serves his prince contemplates simply the leading him in the right path, and directing his mind to benevolence.' 735 1. Mencius said, 'Those who now-a-days serve their sovereigns say, \"We can for our sovereign enlarge the limits of the cultivated ground, and fill his treasuries and arsenals.\" Such persons are now-a-days called \"Good ministers,\" but anciently they were called \"Robbers of the people.\" If a sovereign follows not the right way, nor has his mind bent on benevolence, to seek to enrich him is to enrich a Chieh. 736 2.

On these accounts a tax of one-twentieth of the produce is sufficient there. 742 5. 'But now it is the Middle Kingdom that we live in. To banish the relationships of men, and have no superior men;-- how can such a state of things be thought of? 743 6.

What greater example can there be than this of not eating the bread of idleness?' 829 1. The king's son, Tien, asked Mencius, saying, 'What is the business of the unemployed scholar?' 830 2. Mencius replied, 'To exalt his aim.' 831 3. Tien asked again, 'What do you mean by exalting the aim?' The answer was, 'Setting it simply on benevolence and righteousness. He thinks how to put a single innocent person to death is contrary to benevolence; how to take what one has not a right to is contrary to righteousness; that one's dwelling should be benevolence; and one's path should be righteousness. Where else should he dwell? What other path should he pursue? When benevolence is the dwelling-place of the heart, and righteousness the path of the life, the business of a great man is complete.' Mencius said, 'Supposing that the kingdom of Ch'þ were offered, contrary to righteousness, to Ch'an Chung, he would not receive it, and all people believe in him, as a man of the highest worth. But this is only the righteousness which declines a dish of rice or a plate of soup. A man can have no greater crimes than to disown his parents and relatives, and the relations of sovereign and minister, superiors and inferiors. How can it be allowed to give a man credit for the great excellences because he possesses a small one?' 832 1. T'ýo Ying asked, saying, 'Shun being sovereign, and Kýo-yýo chief minister of justice, if Kÿ-sýu had murdered a man, what would have been done in the case?' 833 2. Mencius said, 'Kýo-yýo would simply have apprehended him.' 834 3. 'But would not Shun have forbidden such a thing?' 835 4. 'Indeed, how could Shun have forbidden it? Kýo-yýo had received the law from a proper source.' Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"836 5. 'In that case what would Shun have done?' 837 6. 'Shun would have regarded abandoning the kingdom as throwing away a worn-out sandal. He would privately have taken his father on his back, and retired into concealment, living some where along the sea-coast. There he would have been all his life, cheerful and happy, forgetting the kingdom.' 838 1. Mencius, going from Fan to Ch'þ, saw the king of Ch'þ's son at a distance, and said with a deep sigh, 'One's position alters the air, just as the nurture affects the body. Great is the influence of position! Are we not all men's sons in this respect?' 839 2. Mencius said, 'The residence, the carriages and horses, and the dress of the king's son, are mostly the same as those of other men. That he looks so is occasioned by his position. How much more should a peculiar air distinguish him whose position is in the wide house of the world! 840 3. 'When the prince of Lÿ went to Sung, he called out at the T'ieh-chýi gate, and the keeper said, \"This is not our prince. How is it that his voice is so like that of our prince?\" This was occasioned by nothing but the correspondence of their positions.' 841 1. Mencius said, 'To feed a scholar and not love him, is to treat him as a pig. To love him and not respect him, is to keep him as a domestic animal. 842 2. 'Honouring and respecting are what exist before any offering of gifts. 843 3. 'If there be honouring and respecting without the reality of them, a superior man may not be retained by such empty demonstrations.' Mencius said, 'The bodily organs with their functions belong to our Heaven-conferred nature. But a man must be a sage before he can satisfy the design of his bodily organization.' 844 1. The king Hsüan of Ch'þ wanted to shorten the period of mourning. Kung-sun Ch'ýu said, 'To have one whole year's mourning is better than doing away with it altogether.' 845 2. Mencius said, 'That is just as if there were one twisting the arm of his elder brother, and you were merely to say to him \"Gently, gently, if you please.\" Your only course should be to teach such an one filial piety and fraternal duty.'

At that time, the mother of one of the king's sons had died, and his tutor asked for him that he might be allowed to observe a few months' mourning. Kung-sun Ch'ýu asked, 'What do you say of this?' 847 4. Mencius replied, 'This is a case where the party wishes to complete the whole period, but finds it impossible to do so. The addition of even a single day is better than not mourning at all. I spoke of the case where there was no hindrance, and the party neglected the thing itself.' 848 1. Mencius said, 'There are five ways in which the superior man effects his teaching. 849 2. 'There are some on whom his influence descends like seasonable rain. 850 3. 'There are some whose virtue he perfects, and some of whose talents he assists the development. 851 4. 'There are some whose inquiries he answers. 852 5. 'There are some who privately cultivate and correct themselves. 853 6. These five ways are the methods in which the superior man effects his teaching.' 854 1.

Why not adapt your teaching so as to cause learners to consider them attainable, and so daily exert themselves!' 855 2.

The disciple Kung-tÿ said, 'When Kang of T'ang made his appearance in your school, it seemed proper that a polite consideration should be paid to him, and yet you did not answer him. Why was that?' 860 2. Mencius replied, 'I do not answer him who questions me presuming on his nobility, nor him who presumes on his talents, nor him who presumes on his age, nor him who presumes on services performed to me, nor him who presumes on old acquaintance. Two of those things were chargeable on Kang of T'ang.' 861 1. Mencius said, 'He who stops short where stopping is acknowledged to be not allowable, will stop short in everything. He who behaves shabbily to those whom he ought to treat well, will behave shabbily to all. 862 2. 'He who advances with precipitation will retire with speed.' Mencius said, 'In regard to inferior creatures, the superior man is kind to them, but not loving. In regard to people generally, he is loving to them, but not affectionate. He is affectionate to his parents, and lovingly disposed to people generally. He is lovingly disposed to people generally, and kind to creatures.' 863 1. Mencius said, 'The wise embrace all knowledge, but they are most earnest about what is of the greatest importance. The benevolent embrace all in their love, but what they consider of the greatest importance is to cultivate an earnest affection for the virtuous. Even the wisdom of Yýo and Shun did not extend to everything, but they attended earnestly to what was important. Their benevolence did not show itself in acts of kindness to every man, but they earnestly cultivated an affection for the virtuous. 864 2. 'Not to be able to keep the three years' mourning, and to be very particular about that of three months, or that of five months; to eat immoderately and swill down the soup, and at the same time to inquire about the precept not to tear the meat with the teeth;-- such things show what I call an ignorance of what is most important.

Sustaining a great defeat, he would engage again, and afraid lest they should not be able to secure the victory, urged his son whom he loved till he sacrificed him with them. This is what I call-- \"beginning with what they do not care for, and proceeding to what they care for.\"' 867 1. Mencius said, 'In the \"Spring and Autumn\" there are no righteous wars. Instances indeed there are of one war better than another. 868 2. '\"Correction\" is when the supreme authority punishes its subjects by force of arms.

Mencius said, 'A carpenter or a carriage-maker may give a man the circle and square, but cannot make him skilful in the use of them.' Mencius said, 'Shun's manner of eating his parched grain and herbs was as if he were to be doing so all his life. When he became sovereign, and had the embroidered robes to wear, the lute to play, and the two daughters of Yýo to wait on him, he was as if those things belonged to him as a matter of course.'

When a man kills another's father, that other will kill his father; when a man kills another's elder brother, that other will kill his elder brother.

If he order men according to what is not the right way, he will not be able to get the obedience of even his wife and children.' Mencius said, 'A bad year cannot prove the cause of death to him whose stores of gain are large; an age of corruption cannot confound him whose equipment of virtue is complete.' Mencius said, 'A man who loves fame may be able to decline a State of a thousand chariots; but if he be not really the man to do such a thing, it will appear in his countenance, in the matter of a dish of rice or a platter of soup.' 880 1.

It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for. 8 In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"He was able to make his virtue illustrious.\" 9 In the Tai Chia, it is said, \"He contemplated and studied the illustrious decrees of Heaven.\" 10 In the Canon of the emperor (Yao), it is said, \"He was able to make illustrious his lofty virtue.\" 11 These passages all show how those sovereigns made themselves illustrious. 12 On the bathing tub of T'ang, the following words were engraved: \"If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.\" 13 In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"To stir up the new people.\" 14 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Although Chau was an ancient state the ordinance which lighted on it was new.\" 15 Therefore, the superior man in everything uses his utmost endeavors. 16 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The royal domain of a thousand li is where the people rest.\" 17 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"The twittering yellow bird rests on a corner of the mound.\" The Master said, \"When it rests, it knows where to rest.

In communication with his subjects, he rested in good faith. 19 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Look at that winding course of the Ch'i, with the green bamboos so luxuriant! Here is our elegant and accomplished prince! As we cut and then file; as we chisel and then grind: so has he cultivated himself. How grave is he and dignified! How majestic and distinguished! Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten.\" That expression-\"As we cut and then file,\" the work of learning. \"As we chisel and then grind,\" indicates that of self-culture. \"How grave is he and dignified!\" indicates the feeling of cautious reverence. \"How commanding and distinguished! indicates an awe-inspiring deportment. \"Our elegant and accomplished prince never can be forgotten,\" indicates how, when virtue is complete and excellence extreme, the people cannot forget them. 20 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Ah! the former kings are not forgotten.\" Future princes deem worthy what they deemed worthy, and love what they loved. The common people delight in what delighted them, and are benefited by their beneficial arrangements. It is on this account that the former kings, after they have quitted the world, are not forgotten. 21 The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What is necessary is to cause the people to have no litigations.\" So, those who are devoid of principle find it impossible to carry out their speeches, and a great awe would be struck into men's minds;-this is called knowing the root. 22 This is called knowing the root. This is called the perfecting of knowledge. 23 What is meant by \"making the thoughts sincere.\" is the allowing no self-deception, as when we hate a bad smell, and as when we love what is beautiful. This is called self-enjoyment. Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone. 24 There is no evil to which the mean man, dwelling retired, will not proceed, but when he sees a superior man, he instantly tries to disguise himself, concealing his evil, and displaying what is good. The other beholds him, as if he saw his heart and reins;-of what use is his disguise? This is an instance of the saying -\"What truly is within will be manifested without.\" Therefore, the superior man must be watchful over himself when he is alone. 25 The disciple Tsang said, \"What ten eyes behold, what ten hands point to, is to be regarded with reverence!\" 26 Riches adorn a house, and virtue adorns the person.

He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress. 28 When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat. 29 This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind. 30 What is meant by \"The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:-men are partial where they feel affection and love; partial where they despise and dislike; partial where they stand in awe and reverence; partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; partial where they are arrogant and rude. Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred. 31 Hence it is said, in the common adage,\"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; he does not know the richness of his growing corn.\" 32 This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, a man cannot regulate his family. 33 What is meant by \"In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first to regulate the family,\" is this:-It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach his own family. Therefore, the ruler, without going beyond his family, completes the lessons for the state. There is filial piety:-therewith the. sovereign should be served. There is fraternal submission:-therewith elders and superiors should be served. There is kindness:-therewith the multitude should be treated. 34 In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"Act as if you were watching over an infant.\" If a mother is really anxious about it, though she may not hit exactly the wants of her infant, she will not be far from doing so. There never has been a girl who learned to bring up a child, that she might afterwards marry. 35 From the loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving, and from its courtesies the whole state becomes courteous while, from the ambition and perverseness of the One man, the whole state may be led to rebellious disorder;-such is the nature of the influence.

Chieh and Chau led on the kingdom with violence, and people followed them. The orders which these issued were contrary to the practices which they loved, and so the people did not follow them. On this account, the ruler must himself be possessed of the good qualities, and then he may require them in the people. He must not have the bad qualities in himself, and then he may require that they shall not be in the people. Never has there been a man, who, not having reference to his own character and wishes in dealing with others, was able effectually to instruct them. 37 Thus we see how the government of the state depends on the regulation of the family. 38 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"That peach tree, so delicate and elegant! How luxuriant is its foliage! This girl is going to her husband's house. She will rightly order her household.\" Let the household be rightly ordered, and then the people of the state may be taught. 39 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"They can discharge their duties to their elder brothers. They can discharge their duties to their younger brothers.\" Let the ruler discharge his duties to his elder and younger brothers, and then he may teach the people of the state. 40 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"In his deportment there is nothing wrong; he rectifies all the people of the state.\" Yes; when the ruler, as a father, a son, and a brother, is a model, then the people imitate him. 41 This is what is meant by saying, \"The government of his kingdom depends on his regulation of the family.\" 42 What is meant by \"The making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on the government of his state,\" this:-When the sovereign behaves to his aged, as the aged should be behaved to, the people become final; when the sovereign behaves to his elders, as the elders should be behaved to, the people learn brotherly submission; when the sovereign treats compassionately the young and helpless, the people do the same. Thus the ruler has a principle with which, as with a measuring square, he may regulate his conduct. 43 What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not display in the service of his superiors; what he hates in those who are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind him; what he hates in those who are behind him, let him not bestow on the left; what he hates to receive on the left, let him not bestow on the right:-this is what is called \"The principle with which, as with a measuring square, to regulate one's conduct.\" 44 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"How much to be rejoiced in are these princes, the parents of the people!\" When a prince loves what the people love, and hates what the people hate, then is he what is called the parent of the people. 45 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Lofty is that southern hill, with its rugged masses of rocks! Greatly distinguished are you, O grand-teacher Yin, the people all look up to you. \"Rulers of states may not neglect to be careful. If they deviate to a mean selfishness, they will be a disgrace in the kingdom. 46 In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \"Before the sovereigns of the Yin dynasty had lost the hearts of the people, they could appear before God. Take warning from the house of Yin. The great decree is not easily preserved.\" This shows that, by gaining the people, the kingdom is gained, and, by losing the people, the kingdom is lost. 47 On this account, the ruler will first take pains about his own virtue. Possessing virtue will give him the people. Possessing the people will give the territory. Possessing the territory will give him its wealth. Possessing the wealth, he will have resources for expenditure. 48 Virtue is the root; wealth is the result. 49 If he make the root his secondary object, and the result his primary, he will only wrangle with his people, and teach them rapine. 50 Hence, the accumulation of wealth is the way to scatter the people; and the letting it be scattered among them is the way to collect the people. 51 And hence, the ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way, and wealth, gotten by improper ways, will take its departure by the same. 52 In the Announcement to K'ang, it is said, \"The decree indeed may not always rest on us\"; that is, goodness obtains the decree, and the want of goodness loses it. 53 In the Book of Ch'u, it is said, \"The kingdom of Ch'u does not consider that to be valuable.

But if it be his character, when he finds men of ability, to be jealous and hate them; and, when he finds accomplished and perspicacious men, to oppose them and not allow their advancement, showing himself really not able to bear them: such a minister will not be able to protect my sons and grandsons and people; and may he not also be pronounced dangerous to the state?\" 56 It is only the truly virtuous man who can send away such a man and banish him, driving him out among the barbarous tribes around, determined not to dwell along with him in the Auddle Kingdom. This is in accordance with the saying, \"It is only the truly virtuous man who can love or who can hate others.\" 57 To see men of worth and not be able to raise them to office; to raise them to office, but not to do so quickly:-this is disrespectful. To see bad men and not be able to remove them; to remove them, but not to do so to a distance:-this is weakness. 58 To love those whom men hate, and to hate those whom men love;-this is to outrage the natural feeling of men. Calamities cannot fail to come down on him who does so. 59 Thus we see that the sovereign has a great course to pursue. He must show entire self-devotion and sincerity to attain it, and by pride and extravagance he will fail of it. 60 There is a great course also for the production of wealth. Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient. 61 The virtuous ruler, by means of his wealth, makes himself more distinguished. The vicious ruler accumulates wealth, at the expense of his life. 62 Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence, and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a case where the people have loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign have not been carried to completion.

Discarding slanderers, and keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of riches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage men of worth and talents.

Giving them numerous officers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way for him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous confidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to encourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper times, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage the people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making their rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to encourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure and meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and show compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently men from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession has been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished; to reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those which are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at court, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after liberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this is the way to cherish the princes of the states. 73 \"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families have the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are carried into practice is singleness. 74 \"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without such previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is to be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling. If affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with them. If one's actions have been previously determined, there will be no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have been previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible. 75 \"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of the sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There is a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not trusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign. There is a way to being trusted by one's friends;-if one is not obedient to his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to being obedient to one's parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in upon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to his parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one's self; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain sincerity in himself. 76 \"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort, hits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds it fast. 77 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what is good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the clear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it. 78 \"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or while in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand, Will not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired about, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not know, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which he does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is not clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which he has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will not intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will use a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will use a thousand. 79 \"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\" 80 When we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition is to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from intelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But given the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the intelligence, and there shall be the sincerity. 81 It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion. 82 Next to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of goodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity. This sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest. From being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others. Affecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are transformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can transform. 83 It is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. When a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be happy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be unlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and affect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness is about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and the evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete sincerity is like a spirit. 84 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Sincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way is that by which man must direct himself. 85 Sincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there would be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment of sincerity as the most excellent thing. 86 The possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion of himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also. The completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other men and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging to the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of the external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere man-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right. 87 Hence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. 88 Not ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself. 89 Evidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large and substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant. 90 Large and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and brilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and continuing long;-this is how it perfects all things. 91 So large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal of Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven. So far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite. 92 Such being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested; without any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort, it accomplishes its ends. 93 The way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They are without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is unfathomable. 94 The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant, far-reaching and long-enduring. 95 Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when viewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations of the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread by it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded in its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and the Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and seas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending our view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas, iguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles of value and sources of wealth abound in it. 96 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound are they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven is Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the virtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was what he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing. 97 How great is the path proper to the Sage! 98 Like overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and rises up to the height of heaven. 99 All-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules of ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor. 100 It waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. 101 Hence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in all its courses, be made a fact.\" 102 Therefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains constant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth and greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute points which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and brilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his old knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest, generous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety. 103 Thus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low situation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed, he is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is sure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this what we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent, and so preserves his person?\" 104 The Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own judgment; let a man without rank be fond of Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"assuming a directing power to himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to the ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities will be sure to come. 105 To no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies, to fix the measures, and to determine the written characters. 106 Now over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size; all writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are the same rules. 107 One may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he may not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue, but if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies or music. 108 The Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned the ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\" 109 He who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three important things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few errors under his government. 110 However excellent may have been the regulations of those of former times, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them. However excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior situation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot command credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow his rules. 111 Therefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character and conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses of the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three kings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven and Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation. He presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts about them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a hundred ages after, and has no misgivings. 112 His presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings, without any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven.

Those who are far from him look longingly for him; and those who are near him are never wearied with him. 114 It is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of here, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their praise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description, that obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom. 115 Chung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had been his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan and Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times of Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land. 116 He may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing, their overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun and moon in their successive shining. 117 All things are nourished together without their injuring one another. The courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without any collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents; the greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this which makes heaven and earth so great. 118 It is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted to exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted to exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring, fitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving from the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished, distinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination. 119 All-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending forth in their due season his virtues. 120 All-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain, he is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him; he speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people all are pleased with him. 121 Therefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to all barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and the earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts and dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and love him.

Just so, it is the way of the superior man to prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of the superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety; while showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments recognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows how what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind proceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such a one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue. 126 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie at the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior man examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and that he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein the superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which other men cannot see. 127 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be there free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore, the superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence, and while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness. 128 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented, and the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\" Therefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are stimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed more than by hatchets and battle-axes. 129 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue. All the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere and reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy tranquility. 130 It is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant virtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\" The Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound and appearances are but Confucian Canon , Retrieved from HolyBooks.net"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"trivial influences.
