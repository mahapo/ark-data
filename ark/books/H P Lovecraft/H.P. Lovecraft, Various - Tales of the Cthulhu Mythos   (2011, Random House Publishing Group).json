CTHULHU FHTAGN![images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg][images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]“Why in the name of science-fiction did you ever print such a story as ‘At theMountains of Madness’ by Lovecraft? Are you in such dire straits that you mustprint this kind of drivel?… If such stories as this—of two people scaringthemselves half to death by looking at the carvings in some ancient ruins, andbeing chased by something that even the author can’t describe, and full ofmutterings about nameless horrors, such as the windowless solids with fivedimensions, Yog-Sothoth, etc.—are what is to constitute the future yarns ofAstounding Stories, then heaven help the cause of science-fiction.”The object of the preceding epistolary animus, taken from the letter column ofthe June 1936 issue of Astounding Stories, was of course one of two CthulhuMythos works by H. P. Lovecraft that were being published by the magazine duringthat same year. Reader response to the Lovecraft stories was not unremittinglynegative, but the favorable commentary tended to be overwhelmed by wails ofindignation, bemusement, dismay.During the 1930s American magazine science fiction was largely the province of aghettoized group of action/adventure hacks who simply transformed the Lazy Xranch into Planet X and then scribbled forth the same formula stories,substituting space pirates for cattle rustlers. For readers accustomed tohopping aboard a starship, flipping on the faster-than-light drive (never mindEinstein’s special theory), and blasting the bejesus out of the eight-legged menof Betelgeuse, Lovecraft’s painstakingly detailed and overtly atmosphericsojourn across the Antarctic wilderness, in which his two intrepid explorersgibber and shriek before the culminant horror, was largely incomprehensible tothe SF enthusiasts of 1936.And the difference between Lovecraft’s Mythos fiction and the galaxy-bustin’ebullience of Doc Smith and his cohorts is more fundamental than a simpleaction-versus-atmosphere dichotomy. Many of the space-opera exponents of theera, such as E. E. Smith, Nat Schachner, and Ralph Milne Farley, had been bornin the previous century when the universe was still perceived to function interms of an immutable Newtonian order. Each star was a sun just like ours, andas nineteenth-century astronomers directed their spectroscopes to the heavens,they received back the reassuring message that the stars contained hydrogen,helium, magnesium, sodium, and other elements precisely like those found withinour own solar system. Toward the end of the century, when physicists werecongratulating themselves on what they thought was their complete understandingof the universe, was the ultimate human conquest of the cosmos really soimprobable?Not according to Albert Einstein, who in 1905 inaugurated the revolution intwentieth-century science that ultimately would forever shatter the tenets ofclassical physics. With subsequent developments in relativity, quantummechanics, subatomic particles, and the like, the universe no longer seemed socomprehensible. Just as Copernicus and Galileo had wrenched humanity from thecenter of creation, so too has modern man come to realize that not only is henot at the center of the cosmos, but that he is a singularity in the cosmos. Theuniverse with its neutron stars and quasars and black holes is strange to us,and we are a stranger in the universe.Of all the science-fiction writers whose work appeared in the magazines duringthe 1930s, only H. P. Lovecraft transcends the gosh-wow insipidities of hiscolleagues to convey this twentieth-century sensibility of the essential mysteryof the cosmos. “All my tales,” wrote Lovecraft in a 1927 letter, “are based onthe fundamental premise that common human laws and interests and emotions haveno validity or significance in the vast cosmos-at-large,” a statement thatvirtually encapsulates the revolution then occurring in modern science, aswide-eyed physicists were in the process of discovering a strange new world notvouchsafed by Newtonian mechanics. Thus the non-Euclidean angles of Cthulhu’ssea-sunken city (see this page [Love_9780307547903_epub_c01_r1.htm#page22])represent the same non-Euclidean geometries with which Einstein had to grapplein formulating his general theory, while the unearthly emanations from themeteorite in “The Colour Out of Space” replicate the radium experimentsundertaken earlier in the century by Becquerel and the Curies. Even currentdevelopments in higher mathematics—the phenomenon of chaos—are presaged in theMythos tales, for the supreme deity in Lovecraft’s imaginary pantheon, the blindidiot god Azathoth, reigns “in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate voidof Chaos.” Suitably accoutred in Mandelbrot fractals and equipped with theFeigenbaum constant, Azathoth would feel eminently at home amid the permutationsand perturbations of contemporary chaos theory.To pursue further the correspondences between the Cthulhu Mythos andtwentieth-century science would be pointless, since Lovecraft’s appropriation ofsuch concepts arose not from a formal knowledge of the higher mathematicsinvolved in, say, relativity, but rather from a sort of serendipitoustemperamental insight into “the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbedspace.” Historically Lovecraft had identified himself with a social and economicaristocracy that had been left behind by the modern twentieth century; anoutsider in his own time and place, the dispossessed dreamer had become anoutsider in the cosmos as well. The Argentine writer Julio Cortázar hassuggested that “all completely successful short stories, especially fantasticstories, are products of neurosis, nightmares, or hallucinations neutralizedthrough objectification and translated to a medium outside the neuroticterrain.” In Lovecraft’s case, his conception of the universe as a harboringplace of eldritch wonders is simply his outsider complex writ large; just asLovecraft was an outsider in his own contemporary Providence, so in the Cthulhufiction is modern man an alien entity, lost, adrift, teetering on the brink ofan awesome abyss.Thus when Lovecraft’s “At the Mountains of Madness,” with its intimations of themysterious immensities of the cosmos, was serialized in Astounding Stories, whatreaders in 1936 had considered “drivel” has been proved by the scientificrevolution of this century to be true. As physician Lewis Thomas observed in arecent article, “The greatest of all the accomplishments of twentieth-centuryscience has been the discovery of human ignorance.” With the preceding statementin mind, stop for a moment, turn to this page[Love_9780307547903_epub_c01_r1.htm#page1] of the present volume, and read theopening paragraph of “The Call of Cthulhu.”After Lovecraft’s death in 1937, eldritch horrors continued to abound. Lovecraftmissed by a few years the accession to Astounding Stories of John W. Campbell,whose editorial skills and influence would dramatically improve the entire fieldof American magazine science fiction. For all his prodigious talents, however,Campbell maintained an essential engineering mentality—a transcendent faith inthe triumph of technology and in the absolute efficacy of human ingenuity andresourcefulness—against which Lovecraft seemed like a freakish anomaly in thescience-fictional firmament.The lonely Providence recluse and his fabled fictional legacy instead were keptalive by a coterie of friends and admirers who preserved the Cthulhu Mythos likemembers of some secret society guarding its sacred lore and icons. To thesenoble efforts at preservation, which included the founding of Arkham House in1939 by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei, was added the more debatableproposition of imitation.During the 1930s Lovecraft himself had concocted ersatz Mythos yarns for variousrevision clients, stories regarding which he significantly noted that “[I]wouldn’t under any circumstances let my name be used in connexion with them.”The years following Lovecraft’s death, beginning with Francis T. Laney’s 1942glossary of Mythos terminology, inaugurated an era in which Cthulhu and hiscosmic cohorts were scrutinized, analyzed, categorized, systematized, bent,folded, stapled—and mutilated. Thus by the 1970s, in a notably superficial bookon the Mythos, an American fantasist opined the presence of “lacunae” inLovecraft’s conception, regarding which it was incumbent upon himself and othersto “fill in” with new stories. Before Lovecraft’s time, the market for tales ofbatrachian anthropophagy had always been rather limited; in the decades afterhis death, the pastiching of Cthulhu & Co. evolved into an industry of cyclopeanproportions.That the preponderance of such derivative work has been, in the words of thelate E. Hoffmann Price, “abominable rubbish” is less significant than the veryreal injustice done thereby to the Mythos. Lovecraft’s imaginary cosmogony wasnever a static system but rather a sort of aesthetic construct that remainedever adaptable to its creator’s developing personality and altered interests.Thus as Gothicism gradually gave way to extraterrestrialism over the last tenyears of Lovecraft’s life, an early Mythos tale such as “The Dunwich Horror”(1928) is still firmly ensconced in a degenerate New England backwater, whilejust six years later, in “The Shadow Out of Time,” Lovecraft’s narrative is adazzling Stapledonian romp through the universe past, present, and future.Similarly, as Lovecraft finally began to outgrow horror fiction in the 1930s,one again can compare “The Dunwich Horror,” in which the Mythos deities arestill demoniac entities to be kept at bay with grimoire-gleaned incantations, to“The Shadow Out of Time,” in which the extraterrestrials have become enlightenedcard-carrying socialists, a direct reflection of Lovecraft’s emergent interestin society and its reform. Had the man lived into the 1940s, the Mythos wouldhave continued to evolve with its creator; there was never a rigid system thatmight be posthumously appropriated by the pasticheur.Secondly, the essence of the Mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deitiesnor in a cobwebby collection of forbidden tomes, but rather in a certainconvincing cosmic attitude. Cosmic was Lovecraft’s endlessly iterated term todescribe his own central aesthetic: “I choose weird stories because they suit myinclination best—one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being toachieve, momentarily, the illusion of some strange suspension or violation ofthe galling limitations of time, space, and natural law which forever imprisonus and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic spaces.…”In a sense, Lovecraft’s entire adult oeuvre is comprised of tales of cosmicwonder, but over the last ten years of his life, when he began to abandonDunsanian exoticism and New England black magic and to seek for subject matterthe mysterious abysses of outer space, he achieved a body of work to which hasbeen posthumously applied the term Cthulhu Mythos. The Mythos, in other words,represents those cosmic wonder tales by Lovecraft in which the author had begunto direct his attention to the modern scientific universe; the Mythos deities inturn hypostatize the qualities of such a purposeless, indifferent, unutterablyalien universe. And thus to all those Lovecraftian imitators who over the yearshave perpetrated Mythos pastiches in which eccentric New England recluses utterthe right incantations in the wrong books and are promptly eaten by a giant frognamed Cthulhu: the Mythos is not a concatenation of facile formulas and glossarygleanings, but rather a certain cosmic state of mind.The preceding strictures do not apply, of course, to the present assemblage ofstories, which are among the relative handful of successful works that have beeninfluenced by the Cthulhu Mythos. A few of the earliest pieces in this volume bycertain “divers hands” now seem like pop-cultural kitsch, perhaps, buteverything else is quite wonderful, with the tales by Robert Bloch (“NotebookFound in a Deserted House”), Fritz Leiber, Ramsey Campbell, Colin Wilson, JoannaRuss, and Stephen King in particular exemplifying the darkly enduring power ofH. P. Lovecraft over a disparate group of writers who have made their owninimitable contributions to the Mythos.And Richard A. Lupoff, author of the final story in this collection, possiblyhas given us something more: “Discovery of the Ghooric Zone” is not just adistinguished Mythos tale; it is the only Mythos tale I have ever encountered byan author other than Lovecraft that conveys some sense of the iconoclasticaudacity that attended the initial publication of Lovecraft’s work and that sooutraged the contemporary readership of Astounding Stories. In this brilliantnarrative Lupoff has managed to include not only the requisite Mythosterminology but also the essential ambience of cosmic wonder, and thenadditionally has re-created some of the mind-blasting excitement of thoseoriginal Mythos stories.

THE HORROR IN CLAYThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the humanmind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance inthe midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyagefar. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed uslittle; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open upsuch terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, thatwe shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light intothe peace and safety of a new dark age.Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle whereinour world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strangesurvivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a blandoptimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse offorbidden aeons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dreamof it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from anaccidental piecing together of separated things—in this case an old newspaperitem and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplishthis piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link inso hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep silentregarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had notsudden death seized him.My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926–27 with the death of mygrand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages inBrown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known asan authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted to by theheads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may berecalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of thecause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from theNewport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled bya nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on theprecipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to thedeceased’s home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visibledisorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of theheart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, wasresponsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from thisdictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder—and more than wonder.As my grand-uncle’s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I wasexpected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purposemoved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of thematerial which I correlated will be later published by the AmericanArchaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedinglypuzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had beenlocked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine thepersonal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed Isucceeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by agreater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of thequeer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings whichI found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the mostsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptorresponsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man’s peace of mind.The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five bysix inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were farfrom modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubismand futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that crypticregularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulkof these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite muchfamiliarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way toidentify this particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations.Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent,though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. Itseemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a formwhich only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhatextravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon,and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. Apulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentarywings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockinglyfrightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architecturalbackground.The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings,in Professor Angell’s most recent hand; and made no pretence to literary style.What seemed to be the main document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in characterspainstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of.This manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which was headed“1925—Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I.,” andthe second, “Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville St., NewOrleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.—Notes on Same, & Prof. Webb’s Acct.” Theother manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of the queerdreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books andmagazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and therest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, withreferences to passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books asFrazer’s Golden Bough and Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe. Thecuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group follyor mania in the spring of 1925.The first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appearsthat on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspecthad called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which wasthen exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox,and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest son of an excellent familyslightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the RhodeIsland School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near thatinstitution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but greateccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strangestories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself“physically hypersensitive,” but the staid folk of the ancient commercial citydismissed him as merely “queer.” Never mingling much with his kind, he haddropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a smallgroup of aesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious topreserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor’s manuscript, the sculptorabruptly asked for the benefit of his host’s archaeological knowledge inidentifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stiltedmanner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed somesharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet impliedkinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox’s rejoinder, which impressedmy uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of afantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, andwhich I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, “It is new,indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams areolder than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdledBabylon.”It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon asleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been aslight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in NewEngland for some years; and Wilcox’s imagination had been keenly affected. Uponretiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of titanblocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister withlatent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from someundetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaoticsensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted torender by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, “Cthulhu fhtagn.”This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbedProfessor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; andstudied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth hadfound himself working, chilled and clad only in his night-clothes, when wakinghad stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwardsaid, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design.Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especiallythose which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; andWilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he wasoffered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mysticalor paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that thesculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besiegedhis visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit,for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the youngman, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whoseburden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, witha subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmaticalsense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequentlyrepeated are those rendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh.”On March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiriesat his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of feverand taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in thenight, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested sincethen only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at oncetelephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case;calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be incharge. The youth’s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things;and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included notonly a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on agigantic thing “miles high” which walked or lumbered about. He at no time fullydescribed this object, but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey,convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosityhe had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object, thedoctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man’s subsidence intolethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but hiswhole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mentaldisorder.On April 2nd at about 3 P.M. every trace of Wilcox’s malady suddenly ceased. Hesat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorantof what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd.Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; butto Professor Angell he was of no further assistance. All traces of strangedreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of hisnight-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughlyusual visions.Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of thescattered notes gave me much material for thought—so much, in fact, that onlythe ingrained scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continueddistrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of thedreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcoxhad had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted aprodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom hecould question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams,and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of hisrequest seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have receivedmore responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary.This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thoroughand really significant digest. Average people in society and business—NewEngland’s traditional “salt of the earth”—gave an almost completely negativeresult, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressionsappear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd—the period ofyoung Wilcox’s delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though fourcases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, andin one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I knowthat panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As itwas, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of havingasked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroborationof what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel thatWilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had beenimposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told adisturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them haddreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably thestronger during the period of the sculptor’s delirium. Over a fourth of thosewho reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those whichWilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of thegigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the notedescribes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architectwith leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the dateof young Wilcox’s seizure, and expired several months later after incessantscreamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referredto these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted somecorroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracingdown only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have oftenwondered if all the objects of the professor’s questioning felt as puzzled asdid this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, andeccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed acutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sourcesscattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where alone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise arambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanaticdeduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from Californiadescribes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some“glorious fulfilment” which never arrives, whilst items from India speakguardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgiesmultiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. Americanofficers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, andNew York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March22–23. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and afantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous “Dream Landscape” inthe Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles ininsane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity fromnoting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch ofcuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callousrationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that youngWilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.II. THE TALE OF INSPECTOR LEGRASSEThe older matters which had made the sculptor’s dream and bas-relief sosignificant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his longmanuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the hellishoutlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics,and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as “Cthulhu”; and allthis in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursuedyoung Wilcox with queries and demands for data.This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when theAmerican Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. ProfessorAngell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominentpart in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by theseveral outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions forcorrect answering and problems for expert solution.The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for theentire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled allthe way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from anylocal source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession anInspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque,repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at aloss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the leastinterest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment wasprompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, orwhatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps southof New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular andhideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realisethat they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitelymore diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of itsorigin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the capturedmembers, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of thepolice for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightfulsymbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head.Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offeringcreated. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men ofscience into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowdingaround him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air ofgenuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas.No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yetcenturies and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenishsurface of unplaceable stone.The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close andcareful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitelyartistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline,but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly,rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrowwings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnaturalmalignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on arectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tipsof the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre,whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped thefront edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of thepedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facialfeelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher’selevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the moresubtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, andincalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any knowntype of art belonging to civilisation’s youth—or indeed to any other time.Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy,greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striationsresembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along thebase were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation ofhalf the world’s expert learning in this field, could form the least notion ofeven their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material,belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it;something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in whichour world and our conceptions have no part.And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at theInspector’s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touchof bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presentlytold with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the lateWilliam Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and anexplorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight yearsbefore, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptionswhich he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast hadencountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, acurious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstinessand repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, andwhich they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down fromhorribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless ritesand human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to asupreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a carefulphonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds inRoman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was thefetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when theaurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated, a verycrude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some crypticwriting. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essentialfeatures of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members,proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply hisinformant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swampcult-worshippers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember asbest he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux. Therethen followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awedsilence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of thephrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, insubstance, both the Esquimau wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chantedto their kindred idols was something very like this—the word-divisions beingguessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among hismongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them thewords meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:“In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse relatedas fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a storyto which I could see my uncle attached profound significance. It savoured of thewildest dreams of myth-maker and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishingdegree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as might beleast expected to possess it.On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a franticsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there,mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte’s men, were in the gripof stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night.It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had everknown; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolenttom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods whereno dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams,soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messengeradded, the people could stand it no more.So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set outin the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of thepassable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through theterrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hangingnooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones orfragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation adepression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined tocreate. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove insight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbinglanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead;and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. Areddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endlessavenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of thecowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene ofunholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged onunguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute,substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of ahidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless whitepolypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-wingeddevils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. Theysaid it had been there before D’Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians,and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmareitself, and to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enoughto keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of thisabhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place ofthe worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds andincidents.Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse’s men asthey ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffledtom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualitiespeculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source shouldyield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic licence here whipped themselves todaemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberatedthrough those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.Now and then the less organised ululation would cease, and from what seemed awell-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong chant that hideousphrase or ritual:“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenlyin sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two wereshaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunatelydeadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and allstood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre’sextent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a moreindescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarolacould paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, andwrithing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire; in the centre of which, revealedby occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith someeight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, restedthe noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up atregular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward,the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It wasinside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared, the generaldirection of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanalbetween the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which inducedone of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses tothe ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancientlegendry and horror. This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; andhe proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of thefaint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainouswhite bulk beyond the remotest trees—but I suppose he had been hearing too muchnative superstition.Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrelcelebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plungeddeterminedly into the nauseous rout. For five minutes the resultant din andchaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, andescapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-sevensullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line betweentwo rows of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severelywounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by theirfellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removedand carried back by Legrasse.Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, theprisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentallyaberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes,largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave acolouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions wereasked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negrofetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures heldwith surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before therewere any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Oneswere gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies hadtold their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had neverdied. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed andalways would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the worlduntil the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mightycity of R’lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneathhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cultwould always be waiting to liberate him.Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could notextract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth,for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were notthe Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The cavern idol was greatCthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him.No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of mouth.The chanted ritual was not the secret—that was never spoken aloud, onlywhispered. The chant meant only this: “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waitsdreaming.”Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest werecommitted to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, andaverred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come tothem from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of thosemysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the police didextract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed tohave sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in themountains of China.Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations oftheosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. Therehad been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had greatcities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were stillto be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vastepochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive Them whenthe stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity.They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images withThem.These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of fleshand blood. They had shape—for did not this star-fashioned image prove it?—butthat shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plungefrom world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They couldnot live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. Theyall lay in stone houses in Their great city of R’lyeh, preserved by the spellsof mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth mightonce more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serveto liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewiseprevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in thedark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all thatwas occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought.Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the firstmen came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding theirdreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small idols whichthe Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars. Thatcult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priestswould take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume Hisrule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would havebecome as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with lawsand morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy.Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill andrevel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust ofecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alivethe memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old ones in dreams,but then something had happened. The great stone city R’lyeh, with its monolithsand sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the oneprimal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the spectralintercourse. But memory never died, and high-priests said that the city wouldrise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the blackspirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up incaverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speakmuch. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtletycould elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he curiouslydeclined to mention. Of the cult, he said that he thought the centre lay amidstthe pathless deserts of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hiddenand untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was virtuallyunknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though thedeathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon ofthe mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose,especially the much-discussed couplet:“That is not dead which can eternal lie,And with strange aeons even death may die.”Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vainconcerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had toldthe truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at TulaneUniversity could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detectivehad come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than theGreenland tale of Professor Webb.The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse’s tale, corroborated asit was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those whoattended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of thesociety. Caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasionalcharlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to ProfessorWebb, but at the latter’s death it was returned to him and remains in hispossession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, andunmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for whatthoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learnedof the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure andexact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, buthad come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formulauttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell’sinstant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminentlynatural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cultin some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten andcontinue the mystery at my uncle’s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttingscollected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but therationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adoptwhat I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying themanuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes withthe cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptorand give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learnedand aged man.Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, ahideous Victorian imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture whichflaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancienthill, and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America. Ifound him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimensscattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, Ibelieve, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he hascrystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares andphantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makesvisible in verse and in painting.Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock andasked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayedsome interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strangedreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study. I did not enlarge hisknowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out. In ashort time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of thedreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum hadinfluenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contoursalmost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could notrecall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dreambas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands.It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he reallyknew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle’s relentless catechismhad let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way inwhich he could possibly have received the weird impressions.He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see withterrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone—whose geometry,he oddly said, was all wrong—and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless,half-mental calling from underground: “Cthulhu fhtagn,” “Cthulhu fhtagn.” Thesewords had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’sdream-vigil in his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite myrational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way,and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading andimagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had foundsubconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statueI now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one.The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered,which I could never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his geniusand his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success histalent promises.The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I hadvisions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. Ivisited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-timeraiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrelprisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for someyears. What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, though it was really nomore than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited meafresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, andvery ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note.My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were, andI discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dreamnotes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle’sdeath was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from anancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from anegro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of thecult-members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methodsand poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites andbeliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway acertain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of myuncle after encountering the sculptor’s data have come to sinister ears? I thinkProfessor Angell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely tolearn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I havelearned much now.III. THE MADNESS FROM THE SEAIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of theresults of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece ofshelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in thecourse of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, theSydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau whichhad at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle’sresearch.I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the“Cthulhu Cult,” and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; thecurator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day thereserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of themuseum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spreadbeneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friendhas wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was ahalftone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrassehad found in the swamp.Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item indetail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What itsuggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and Icarefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows:MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEAVigilant Arrives with Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale ofDesperate Battle and Deaths at Sea.Rescued Seaman RefusesParticulars of Strange Experience.Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiryto Follow.The Morrison Co.’s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived thismorning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabledbut heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April12th in S. Latitude 34° 21′, W. Longitude 152° 17′ with one living and one deadman aboard.The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was drivenconsiderably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monsterwaves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted,was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious conditionand one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man wasclutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height,regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, andthe Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which thesurvivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine ofcommon pattern.This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story ofpiracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence,and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, whichsailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, hesays, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm ofMarch 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49° 51′, W. Longitude 128° 34′,encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas andhalf-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon theschooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of theyacht’s equipment. The Emma’s men shewed fight, says the survivor, and thoughthe schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed toheave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the savage crew on theyacht’s deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightlysuperior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though ratherclumsy mode of fighting.Three of the Emma’s men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, werekilled; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigatethe captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reasonfor their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised andlanded on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of theocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerlyreticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into arock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried tomanage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time tillhis rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recallwhen William Briden, his companion, died. Briden’s death reveals no apparentcause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices fromDunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and borean evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group ofhalf-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted nolittle curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm andearth tremors of March 1st. Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and hercrew an excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthyman. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginningtomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak morefreely than he has done hitherto.This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a trainof ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the CthulhuCult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. Whatmotive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about withtheir hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma’s crewhad died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had thevice-admiralty’s investigation brought out, and what was known of the noxiouscult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than naturallinkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance tothe various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?March 1st—our February 28th according to the International Date Line—theearthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew haddarted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of theearth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean citywhilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreadedCthulhu. March 23d the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left sixmen dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightenedvividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst anarchitect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! Andwhat of this storm of April 2nd—the date on which all dreams of the dank cityceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What ofall this—and of those hints of old Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Onesand their coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams? Was Itottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man’s power to bear? If so, theymust be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April had put astop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind’s soul.That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieuand took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin;where, however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members whohad lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common forspecial mention; though there was vague talk about one inland trip thesemongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on thedistant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hairturned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and hadthereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his oldhome in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more thanhe had told the admiralty officials, and all they could do was to give me hisOslo address.After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members ofthe vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, atCircular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk.The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, andhieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studiedit long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, andwith the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness ofmaterial which I had noted in Legrasse’s smaller specimen. Geologists, thecurator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the worldheld no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had toldLegrasse about the primal Great Ones: “They had come from the stars, and hadbrought Their images with Them.”Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolvedto visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for theNorwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadowof the Egeberg. Johansen’s address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of KingHarold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuriesthat the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana.” I made the brief trip bytaxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancientbuilding with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons,and I was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English thatGustaf Johansen was no more.He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he had told the public, buthad left a long manuscript—of “technical matters” as he said—written in English,evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal. During awalk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers fallingfrom an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped himto his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physiciansfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakenedconstitution.I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me tillI, too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise. Persuading the widow that myconnexion with her husband’s “technical matters” was sufficient to entitle me tohis manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the Londonboat. It was a simple, rambling thing—a naive sailor’s effort at a post-factodiary—and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attemptto transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tellits gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessel’s sidesbecame so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and theThing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors thatlurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowedblasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favoured bya nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever anotherearthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.Johansen’s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma,in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full forceof that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottomthe horrors that filled men’s dreams. Once more under control, the ship wasmaking good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feelthe mate’s regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthycult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was somepeculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seemalmost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessnessbrought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then,driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen’s command, themen sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47°9′, W. Longitude 126° 43′ come upon a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedyCyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance ofearth’s supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh, that was built inmeasureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped downfrom the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in greenslimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughtsthat spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to thefaithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All thisJohansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadelwhereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I thinkof the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to killmyself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of thisdripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance thatit was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size ofthe greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with thequeer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in everyline of the mate’s frightened description.Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close toit when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structureor building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stonesurfaces—surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for thisearth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talkabout angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awfuldreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal,non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart fromours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terriblereality.Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis,and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been nomortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed throughthe polarising miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twistedmenace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carvenrock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed convexity.Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything moredefinite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he notfeared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that theysearched—vainly, as it proved—for some portable souvenir to bear away.It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith andshouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at theimmense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was,Johansen said, like a great barndoor; and they all felt that it was a doorbecause of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they couldnot decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outsidecellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong.One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence therelative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable.Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan feltover it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went.He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding—that is, one wouldcall it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal—and the men wonderedhow any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, theacre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it wasbalanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb andrejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of themonstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it movedanomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspectiveseemed upset.The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness wasindeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls asought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from itsaeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into theshrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour arising fromthe newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkinsthought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, andeveryone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight andgropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway intothe tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.Poor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the sixmen who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in thataccursed instant. The Thing cannot be described—there is no language for suchabysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of allmatter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonderthat across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved withfever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, stickyspawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, andwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors haddone by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again,and ravening for delight.Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God restthem, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, andAngstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly overendless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he wasswallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn’t have been there; an anglewhich was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansenreached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainousmonstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edgeof the water.Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of allhands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverishrushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way.Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began tochurn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that wasnot of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polyphemecursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops,great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vastwave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad,laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him onenight in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtakethe Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and,setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed thewheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as thesteam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head onagainst the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern ofa daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up tothe bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There wasa bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a clovensunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that thechronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by anacrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seethingastern; where—God in heaven!—the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawnwas nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distancewidened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin andattended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by hisside. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reactionhad taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and agathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectralwhirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reelinguniverses on a comet’s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moonand from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus ofthe distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps ofTartarus.Out of that dream came rescue—the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, thestreets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by theEgeberg. He could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what heknew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon ifonly it could blot out the memories.That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside thebas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record ofmine—this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hopemay never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe hasto hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer mustever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As myuncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cultstill lives.Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which hasshielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, forthe Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers onearth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonelyplaces. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss,or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knowsthe end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomenesswaits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities ofmen. A time will come—but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I donot survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity andsee that it meets no other eye.* Originally published in Weird Tales, February 1928."},{"pageContent":"THE RETURN OF THE SORCERER*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]CLARK ASHTON SMITH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]I had been out of work for several months, and my savings were perilously nearthe vanishing point. Therefore I was naturally elated when I received from JohnCarnby a favorable answer inviting me to present my qualifications in person.Carnby had advertised for a secretary, stipulating that all applicants mustoffer a preliminary statement of their capacities by letter, and I had writtenin response to the advertisement.Carnby, no doubt, was a scholarly recluse who felt averse to contact with a longwaiting-list of strangers; and he had chosen this manner of weeding outbeforehand many, if not all, of those who were ineligible. He had specified hisrequirements fully and succinctly, and these were of such nature as to bar eventhe average well-educated person. A knowledge of Arabic was necessary, amongother things; and luckily I had acquired a certain degree of scholarship in thisunusual tongue.I found the address, of whose location I had formed only a vague idea, at theend of a hilltop avenue in the suburbs of Oakland. It was a large, two-storyhouse, overshaded by ancient oaks and dark with a mantling of unchecked ivy,among hedges of unpruned privet and shrubbery that had gone wild for many years.It was separated from its neighbors by a vacant, weed-grown lot on one side anda tangle of vines and trees on the other, surrounding the black ruins of a burntmansion.Even apart from its air of long neglect, there was something drear and dismalabout the place—something that inhered in the ivy-blurred outlines of the house,in the furtive, shadowy windows, and the very forms of the misshapen oaks andoddly sprawling shrubbery. Somehow, my elation became a trifle less exuberant,as I entered the grounds and followed an unswept path to the front door.When I found myself in the presence of John Carnby, my jubilation was stillsomewhat further diminished; though I could not have given a tangible reason forthe premonitory chill, the dull, somber feeling of alarm that I experienced, andthe leaden sinking of my spirits. Perhaps it was the dark library in which hereceived me as much as the man himself—a room whose musty shadows could neverhave been wholly dissipated by sun or lamplight. Indeed, it must have been this;for John Carnby himself was very much the sort of person I had pictured him tobe.He had all the earmarks of the lonely scholar who has devoted patient years tosome line of erudite research. He was thin and bent, with a massive forehead anda mane of grizzled hair; and the pallor of the library was on his hollow,clean-shaven cheeks. But coupled with this, there was a nerve-shattered air, afearful shrinking that was more than the normal shyness of a recluse, and anunceasing apprehensiveness that betrayed itself in every glance of hisdark-ringed, feverish eyes and every movement of his bony hands. In alllikelihood his health had been seriously impaired by over-application; and Icould not help but wonder at the nature of the studies that had made him atremulous wreck. But there was something about him—perhaps the width of hisbowed shoulders and the bold aquilinity of his facial outlines—which gave theimpression of great former strength and a vigor not yet wholly exhausted.His voice was unexpectedly deep and sonorous.“I think you will do, Mr. Ogden,” he said, after a few formal questions, most ofwhich related to my linguistic knowledge, and in particular my mastery ofArabic. “Your labors will not be very heavy; but I want someone who can be onhand at any time required. Therefore you must live with me. I can give you acomfortable room, and I guarantee that my cooking will not poison you. I oftenwork at night; and I hope you will not find the irregular hours toodisagreeable.”No doubt I should have been overjoyed at this assurance that the secretarialposition was to be mine. Instead, I was aware of a dim, unreasoning reluctanceand an obscure forewarning of evil as I thanked John Carnby and told him that Iwas ready to move in whenever he desired.He appeared to be greatly pleased; and the queer apprehensiveness went out ofhis manner for a moment.“Come immediately—this very afternoon, if you can,” he said. “I shall be veryglad to have you, and the sooner the better. I have been living entirely alonefor some time; and I must confess that the solitude is beginning to pall uponme. Also, I have been retarded in my labors for lack of the proper help. Mybrother used to live with me and assist me, but he has gone away on a longtrip.”* * *I returned to my downtown lodgings, paid my rent with the last few dollars thatremained to me, packed my belongings, and in less than an hour was back at mynew employer’s home. He assigned me a room on the second floor, which, thoughunaired and dusty, was more than luxurious in comparison with the hall-bedroomthat failing funds had compelled me to inhabit for some time past. Then he tookme to his own study, which was on the same floor, at the further end of thehall. Here, he explained to me, most of my future work would be done.I could hardly restrain an exclamation of surprise as I viewed the interior ofthis chamber. It was very much as I should have imagined the den of some oldsorcerer to be. There were tables strewn with archaic instruments of doubtfuluse, with astrological charts, with skulls and alembics and crystals, withcensers such as are used in the Catholic Church, and volumes bound in worm-eatenleather with verdigris-mottled clasps. In one corner stood the skeleton of alarge ape; in another, a human skeleton; and overhead a stuffed crocodile wassuspended.There were cases overpiled with books, and even a cursory glance at the titlesshowed me that they formed a singularly comprehensive collection of ancient andmodern works on demonology and the black arts. There were some weird paintingsand etchings on the walls, dealing with kindred themes; and the whole atmosphereof the room exhaled a medley of half-forgotten superstitions. Ordinarily I wouldhave smiled if confronted with such things; but somehow, in this lonely, dismalhouse, beside the neurotic, hag-ridden Carnby, it was difficult for me torepress an actual shudder.On one of the tables, contrasting incongruously with this melange ofmediaevalism and Satanism, there stood a typewriter, surrounded with piles ofdisorderly manuscript. At one end of the room there was a small, curtainedalcove with a bed in which Carnby slept. At the end opposite the alcove, betweenthe human and simian skeletons, I perceived a locked cupboard that was set inthe wall.Carnby had noted my surprise, and was watching me with a keen, analyticexpression which I found impossible to fathom. He began to speak, in explanatorytones.“I have made a life-study of demonism and sorcery,” he declared. “It is afascinating field, and one that is singularly neglected. I am now preparing amonograph, in which I am trying to correlate the magical practices anddemon-worship of every known age and people. Your labors, at least for a while,will consist in typing and arranging the voluminous preliminary notes which Ihave made, and in helping me to track down other references and correspondences.Your knowledge of Arabic will be invaluable to me, for I am none toowell-grounded in this language myself, and I am depending for certain essentialdata on a copy of the Necronomicon in the original Arabic text. I have reason tothink that there are certain omissions and erroneous renderings in the Latinversion of Olaus Wormius.”I had heard of this rare, well-nigh fabulous volume, but had never seen it. Thebook was supposed to contain the ultimate secrets of evil and forbiddenknowledge; and, moreover, the original text, written by the mad Arab, AbdulAlhazred, was said to be unprocurable. I wondered how it had come into Carnby’spossession.“I’ll show you the volume after dinner,” Carnby went on. “You will doubtless beable to elucidate one or two passages that have long puzzled me.”The evening meal, cooked and served by my employer himself, was a welcome changefrom cheap restaurant fare. Carnby seemed to have lost a good deal of hisnervousness. He was very talkative, and even began to exhibit a certainscholarly gaiety after we had shared a bottle of mellow Sauterne. Still, with nomanifest reason, I was troubled by intimations and forebodings which I couldneither analyze nor trace to their rightful source.We returned to the study, and Carnby brought out from a locked drawer the volumeof which he had spoken. It was enormously old, and was bound in ebony coversarabesqued with silver and set with darkly glowing garnets. When I opened theyellowing pages, I drew back with involuntary revulsion at the odor which arosefrom them—an odor that was more than suggestive of physical decay, as if thebook had lain among corpses in some forgotten graveyard and had taken on thetaint of dissolution.Carnby’s eyes were burning with a fevered light as he took the old manuscriptfrom my hands and turned to a page near the middle. He indicated a certainpassage with his lean forefinger.“Tell me what you make of this,” he said, in a tense, excited whisper.I deciphered the paragraph, slowly and with some difficulty, and wrote down arough English version with the pad and pencil which Carnby offered me. Then, athis request, I read it aloud:“It is verily known by few, but is nevertheless an attestable fact, that thewill of a dead sorcerer hath power upon his own body and can raise it up fromthe tomb and perform therewith whatever action was unfulfilled in life. And suchresurrections are invariably for the doing of malevolent deeds and for thedetriment of others. Most readily can the corpse be animated if all its membershave remained intact; and yet there are cases in which the excelling will of thewizard hath reared up from death the sundered pieces of a body hewn in manyfragments, and hath caused them to serve his end, either separately or in atemporary reunion. But in every instance, after the action hath been completed,the body lapseth into its former state.”Of course, all this was errant gibberish. Probably it was the strange, unhealthylook of utter absorption with which my employer listened, more than thatdamnable passage from the Necronomicon, which caused my nervousness and made mestart violently when, toward the end of my reading, I heard an indescribableslithering noise in the hall outside. But when I finished the paragraph andlooked up at Carnby, I was more than startled by the expression of stark,staring fear which his features had assumed—an expression as of one who ishaunted by some hellish phantom. Somehow, I got the feeling that he waslistening to that odd noise in the hallway rather than to my translation ofAbdul Alhazred.“The house is full of rats,” he explained, as he caught my inquiring glance. “Ihave never been able to get rid of them, with all my efforts.”The noise, which still continued, was that which a rat might make in draggingsome object slowly along the floor. It seemed to draw closer, to approach thedoor of Carnby’s room, and then, after an intermission, it began to move againand receded. My employer’s agitation was marked; he listened with fearfulintentness and seemed to follow the progress of the sound with a terror thatmounted as it drew near and decreased a little with its recession.“I am very nervous,” he said. “I have worked too hard lately, and this is theresult. Even a little noise upsets me.”The sound had now died away somewhere in the house. Carnby appeared to recoverhimself in a measure.“Will you please re-read your translation?” he requested. “I want to follow itvery carefully, word by word.”I obeyed. He listened with the same look of unholy absorption as before, andthis time we were not interrupted by any noises in the hallway. Carnby’s facegrew paler, as if the last remnant of blood had been drained from it, when Iread the final sentences; and the fire in his hollow eyes was likephosphorescence in a deep vault.“That is a most remarkable passage,” he commented. “I was doubtful about itsmeaning, with my imperfect Arabic; and I have found that the passage is whollyomitted in the Latin of Olaus Wormius. Thank you for your scholarly rendering.You have certainly cleared it up for me.”His tone was dry and formal, as if he were repressing himself and holding back aworld of unsurmisable thoughts and emotions. Somehow I felt that Carnby was morenervous and upset than ever, and also that my reading from the Necronomicon hadin some mysterious manner contributed to his perturbation. He wore a ghastlybrooding expression, as if his mind were busy with some unwelcome and forbiddentheme.However, seeming to collect himself, he asked me to translate another passage.This turned out to be a singular incantatory formula for the exorcism of thedead, with a ritual that involved the use of rare Arabian spices and the properintoning of at least a hundred names of ghouls and demons. I copied it all outfor Carnby, who studied it for a long time with a rapt eagerness that was morethan scholarly.“That, too,” he observed, “is not in Olaus Wormius.” After perusing it again, hefolded the paper carefully and put it away in the same drawer from which he hadtaken the Necronomicon.That evening was one of the strangest I have ever spent. As we sat for hourafter hour discussing renditions from that unhallowed volume, I came to knowmore and more definitely that my employer was mortally afraid of something; thathe dreaded being alone and was keeping me with him on this account rather thanfor any other reason. Always he seemed to be waiting and listening with apainful, tortured expectation, and I saw that he gave only a mechanicalawareness to much that was said. Among the weird appurtenances of the room, inthat atmosphere of unmanifested evil, of untold horror, the rational part of mymind began to succumb slowly to a recrudescence of dark ancestral fears. Ascorner of such things in my normal moments, I was now ready to believe in themost baleful creations of superstitious fancy. No doubt, by some process ofmental contagion, I had caught the hidden terror from which Carnby suffered.By no word or syllable, however, did the man admit the actual feelings that wereevident in his demeanor, but he spoke repeatedly of a nervous ailment. More thanonce, during our discussion, he sought to imply that his interest in thesupernatural and the Satanic was wholly intellectual, that he, like myself, waswithout personal belief in such things. Yet I knew infallibly that hisimplications were false; that he was driven and obsessed by a real faith in allthat he pretended to view with scientific detachment, and had doubtless fallen avictim to some imaginary horror entailed by his occult researches. But myintuition afforded me no clue to the actual nature of this horror.There was no repetition of the sounds that had been so disturbing to myemployer. We must have sat till after midnight with the writings of the mad Arabopen before us. At last Carnby seemed to realize the lateness of the hour.“I fear I have kept you up too long,” he said apologetically. “You must go andget some sleep. I am selfish, and I forget that such hours are not habitual toothers, as they are to me.”I made the formal denial of his self-impeachment which courtesy required, saidgood-night, and sought my own chamber with a feeling of intense relief. Itseemed to me that I would leave behind me in Carnby’s room all the shadowy fearand oppression to which I had been subjected.Only one light was burning in the long passage. It was near Carnby’s door; andmy own door at the further end, close to the stairhead, was in deep shadow. As Igroped for the knob, I heard a noise behind me, and turned to see in the gloom asmall, indistinct body that sprang from the hall-landing to the top stair,disappearing from view. I was horribly startled; for even in that vague,fleeting glimpse, the thing was much too pale for a rat and its form was not atall suggestive of an animal. I could not have sworn what it was, but theoutlines had seemed unmentionably monstrous. I stood trembling violently inevery limb, and heard on the stairs a singular bumping sound like the fall of anobject rolling downward from step to step. The sound was repeated at regularintervals, and finally ceased.If the safety of the soul and body depended upon it, I could not have turned onthe stair-light; nor could I have gone to the top steps to ascertain the agencyof that unnatural bumping. Anyone else, it might seem, would have done this.Instead, after a moment of virtual petrification, I entered my room, locked thedoor, and went to bed in a turmoil of unresolved doubt and equivocal terror. Ileft the light burning; and I lay awake for hours, expecting momentarily arecurrence of that abominable sound. But the house was as silent as a morgue,and I heard nothing. At length, in spite of my anticipations to the contrary, Ifell asleep and did not awaken till after many sodden, dreamless hours.It was ten o’clock, as my watch informed me. I wondered whether my employer hadleft me undisturbed through thoughtfulness, or had not arisen himself. I dressedand went downstairs, to find him waiting at the breakfast table. He was palerand more tremulous than ever, as if he had slept badly.“I hope the rats didn’t annoy you too much,” he remarked, after a preliminarygreeting. “Something really must be done about them.”“I didn’t notice them at all,” I replied. Somehow, it was utterly impossible forme to mention the queer, ambiguous thing which I had seen and heard on retiringthe night before. Doubtless I had been mistaken; doubtless it had been merely arat after all, dragging something down the stairs. I tried to forget thehideously repeated noise and the momentary flash of unthinkable outlines in thegloom.My employer eyed me with uncanny sharpness, as if he sought to penetrate myinmost mind. Breakfast was a dismal affair; and the day that followed was noless dreary. Carnby isolated himself till the middle of the afternoon, and I wasleft to my own devices in the well-supplied but conventional library downstairs.What Carnby was doing alone in his room I could not surmise; but I thought morethan once that I heard the faint, monotonous intonations of a solemn voice.Horror-breeding hints and noisome intuitions invaded my brain. More and more theatmosphere of that house enveloped and stifled me with poisonous, miasmalmystery; and I felt everywhere the invisible brooding of malignant incubi.It was almost a relief when my employer summoned me to his study. Entering, Inoticed that the air was full of a pungent, aromatic smell and was touched bythe vanishing coils of a blue vapor, as if from the burning of Oriental gums andspices in the church censers. An Ispahan rug had been moved from its positionnear the wall to the center of the room, but was not sufficient to coverentirely a curving violet mark that suggested the drawing of a magic circle onthe floor. No doubt Carnby had been performing some sort of incantation; and Ithought of the awesome formula I had translated at his request.However, he did not offer any explanation of what he had been doing. His mannerhad changed remarkably and was more controlled and confident than at any formertime. In a fashion almost businesslike he laid before me a pile of manuscriptwhich he wanted me to type for him. The familiar click of the keys aided mesomewhat in dismissing my apprehensions of vague evil, and I could almost smileat the recherche and terrific information comprised in my employer’s notes,which dealt mainly with formulae for the acquisition of unlawful power. Butstill, beneath my reassurance, there was a vague, lingering disquietude.Evening came; and after our meal we returned again to the study. There was atenseness in Carnby’s manner now, as if he were eagerly awaiting the result ofsome hidden test. I went on with my work; but some of his emotion communicateditself to me, and ever and anon I caught myself in an attitude of strainedlistening.At last, above the click of the keys, I heard the peculiar slithering in thehall. Carnby had heard it, too, and his confident look had utterly vanished,giving place to the most pitiable fear.The sound drew nearer and was followed by a dull, dragging noise, and then bymore sounds of an unidentifiable slithering and scuttling nature that varied inloudness. The hall was seemingly full of them, as if a whole army of rats werehauling some carrion booty along the floor. And yet no rodent or number ofrodents could have made such sounds, or could have moved anything so heavy asthe object which came behind the rest. There was something in the character ofthose noises, something without name or definition, which caused a slowlycreeping chill to invade my spine.“Good Lord! What is all that racket?” I cried.“The rats! I tell you it is only rats!” Carnby’s voice was a high hystericalshriek.A moment later, there came an unmistakable knocking on the door, near the sill.At the same time I heard a heavy thudding in the locked cupboard at the furtherend of the room. Carnby had been standing erect, but now he sank limply into achair. His features were ashen, and his look was almost maniacal with fright.The nightmare doubt and tension became unbearable and I ran to the door andflung it open, in spite of a frantic remonstrance from my employer. I had noidea what I should find as I stepped across the sill into the dim-lit hall.When I looked down and saw the thing on which I had almost trodden, my feelingwas one of sick amazement and actual nausea. It was a human hand which had beensevered at the wrist—a bony, bluish hand like that of a week-old corpse, withgarden-mould on the fingers and under the long nails. The damnable thing hadmoved! It had drawn back to avoid me, and was crawling along the passagesomewhat in the manner of a crab! And following it with my gaze, I saw thatthere were other things beyond it, one of which I recognized as a man’s foot andanother as a forearm. I dared not look at the rest. All were moving slowly,hideously away in a charnel procession, and I cannot describe the fashion inwhich they moved. Their individual vitality was horrifying beyond endurance. Itwas more than the vitality of life, yet the air was laden with a carrion taint.I averted my eyes and stepped back into Carnby’s room, closing the door behindme with a shaking hand. Carnby was at my side with the key, which he turned inthe lock with palsy-stricken fingers that had become as feeble as those of anold man.“You saw them?” he asked in a dry, quavering whisper.“In God’s name, what does it all mean?” I cried.Carnby went back to his chair, tottering a little with weakness. His lineamentswere agonized by the gnawing of some inward horror, and he shook visibly like anague patient. I sat down in a chair beside him, and he began to stammer forthhis unbelievable confession, half incoherently, with inconsequential mouthingsand many breaks and pauses:“He is stronger than I am—even in death, even with his body dismembered by thesurgeon’s knife and saw that I used. I thought he could not return afterthat—after I had buried the portions in a dozen different places, in the cellar,beneath the shrubs, at the foot of the ivyvines. But the Necronomicon isright … and Helman Carnby knew it. He warned me before I killed him, he told mehe could return—even in that condition.“But I did not believe him. I hated Helman, and he hated me, too. He hadattained to higher power and knowledge and was more favored by the Dark Onesthan I. That was why I killed him—my own twin-brother, and my brother in theservice of Satan and of Those who were before Satan. We had studied together formany years. We had celebrated the Black Mass together and we were attended bythe same familiars. But Helman Carnby had gone deeper into the occult, into theforbidden, where I could not follow him. I feared him, and I could not endurehis supremacy.“It is more than a week—it is ten days since I did the deed. But Helman—or somepart of him—has returned every night.… God! His accursed hands crawling on thefloor! His feet, his arms, the segments of his legs, climbing the stairs in someunmentionable way to haunt me!… Christ! His awful, bloody torso lying in wait! Itell you, his hands have come even by day to tap and fumble at my door … and Ihave stumbled over his arms in the dark.“Oh, God! I shall go mad with the awfulness of it. But he wants me to go mad, hewants to torture me till my brain gives way. That is why he haunts me in thispiecemeal fashion. He could end it all at any time, with the demoniacal powerthat is his. He could re-knit his sundered limbs and body and slay me as I slewhim.“How carefully I buried the parts, with what infinite forethought! And howuseless it was! I buried the saw and the knife, too, at the further end of thegarden, as far away as possible from his evil, itching hands. But I did not burythe head with the other pieces—I kept it in that cupboard at the end of my room.Sometimes I have heard it moving there, as you heard it a while ago.… But hedoes not need the head, his will is elsewhere, and can work intelligentlythrough all his members.“Of course, I locked all the doors and windows at night when I found that he wascoming back.… But it made no difference. And I have tried to exorcise him withthe appropriate incantations—with all those that I knew. Today I tried thatsovereign formula from the Necronomicon which you translated for me. I got youhere to translate it. Also, I could no longer bear to be alone and I thoughtthat it might help if there were someone else in the house. That formula was mylast hope. I thought it would hold him—it is a most ancient and most dreadfulincantation. But, as you have seen, it is useless.…”His voice trailed off in a broken mumble, and he sat staring before him withsightless, intolerable eyes in which I saw the beginning flare of madness. Icould say nothing—the confession he had made was so ineffably atrocious. Themoral shock, and the ghastly supernatural horror, had almost stupefied me. Mysensibilities were stunned; and it was not till I had begun to recover myselfthat I felt the irresistible surge of a flood of loathing for the man beside me.I rose to my feet. The house had grown very silent, as if the macabre andcharnel army of beleaguerment had now retired to its various graves. Carnby hadleft the key in the lock; and I went to the door and turned it quickly.“Are you leaving? Don’t go,” Carnby begged in a voice that was tremulous withalarm, as I stood with my hand on the doorknob.“Yes, I am going,” I said coldly. “I am resigning my position right now; and Iintend to pack my belongings and leave your house with as little delay aspossible.”I opened the door and went out, refusing to listen to the arguments andpleadings and protestations he had begun to babble. For the nonce, I preferredto face whatever might lurk in the gloomy passage, no matter how loathsome andterrifying, rather than endure any longer the society of John Carnby.The hall was empty; but I shuddered with repulsion at the memory of what I hadseen, as I hastened to my room. I think I should have screamed aloud at theleast sound or movement in the shadows.I began to pack my valise with a feeling of the most frantic urgency andcompulsion. It seemed to me that I could not escape soon enough from that houseof abominable secrets, over which hung an atmosphere of smothering menace. Imade mistakes in my haste, I stumbled over chairs, and my brain and fingers grewnumb with a paralyzing dread.I had almost finished my task, when I heard the sound of slow measured footstepscoming up the stairs. I knew that it was not Carnby, for he had locked himselfimmediately in his room when I had left; and I felt sure that nothing could havetempted him to emerge. Anyway, he could hardly have gone downstairs without myhearing him.The footsteps came to the top landing and went past my door along the hall, withthat same monotonous repetition, regular as the movement of a machine. Certainlyit was not the soft, nervous tread of John Carnby.Who, then, could it be? My blood stood still in my veins; I dared not finish thespeculation that arose in my mind.The steps paused; and I knew that they had reached the door of Carnby’s room.There followed an interval in which I could scarcely breathe; and then I heardan awful crashing and shattering noise, and above it the soaring scream of a manin the uttermost extremity of fear.I was powerless to move, as if an unseen iron hand had reached forth to restrainme; and I have no idea how long I waited and listened. The scream had fallenaway in a swift silence; and I heard nothing now, except a low, peculiar,recurrent sound which my brain refused to identify.It was not my own volition, but a stronger will than mine, which drew me forthat last and impelled me down the hall to Carnby’s study. I felt the presence ofthat will as an overpowering, superhuman thing—a demoniac force, a malignmesmerism.The door of the study had been broken in and was hanging by one hinge. It wassplintered as by the impact of more than mortal strength. A light was stillburning in the room, and the unmentionable sound I had been hearing ceased as Ineared the threshold. It was followed by an evil, utter stillness.Again I paused, and could go no further. But, this time, it was something otherthan the hellish, all-pervading magnetism that petrified my limbs and arrestedme before the sill. Peering into the room, in the narrow space that was framedby the doorway and lit by an unseen lamp, I saw one end of the Oriental rug, andthe gruesome outlines of a monstrous, unmoving shadow that fell beyond it on thefloor. Huge, elongated, misshapen, the shadow was seemingly cast by the arms andtorso of a naked man who stooped forward with a surgeon’s saw in his hand. Itsmonstrosity lay in this: though the shoulders, chest, abdomen, and arms were allclearly distinguishable, the shadow was headless and appeared to terminate in anabruptly severed neck. It was impossible, considering the relative position, forthe head to have been concealed from sight through any manner of foreshortening.I waited, powerless to enter or withdraw. The blood had flowed back upon myheart in an ice-thick tide, and thought was frozen in my brain. An interval oftermless horror, and then, from the hidden end of Carnby’s room, from thedirection of the locked cupboard, there came a fearsome and violent crash, andthe sound of splintering wood and whining hinges, followed by the sinister,dismal thud of an unknown object striking the floor.Again there was silence—a silence as of consummated Evil brooding above itsunnameable triumph. The shadow had not stirred. There was a hideouscontemplation in its attitude, and the saw was still held in its poising hand,as if above a completed task.Another interval, and then, without warning, I witnessed the awful andunexplainable disintegration of the shadow, which seemed to break gently andeasily into many different shadows ere it faded from view. I hesitate todescribe the manner, or specify the places, in which this singular disruption,this manifold cleavage, occurred. Simultaneously, I heard the muffled clatter ofa metallic implement on the Persian rug, and a sound that was not of a singlebody but of many bodies falling.Once more there was silence—a silence as of some nocturnal cemetery, whengrave-diggers and ghouls are done with their macabre toil, and the dead aloneremain.Drawn by the baleful mesmerism, like a somnambulist led by an unseen demon, Ientered the room. I knew with a loathly prescience the sight that awaited mebeyond the sill—the double heap of human segments, some of them fresh andbloody, and others already blue with beginning putrefaction and marked withearth-stains, that were mingled in abhorrent confusion on the rug.A reddened knife and saw were protruding from the pile; and a little to oneside, between the rug and the open cupboard with its shattered door, therereposed a human head that was fronting the other remnants in an upright posture.It was in the same condition of incipient decay as the body to which itbelonged; but I swear that I saw the fading of a malignant exultation from itsfeatures as I entered. Even with the marks of corruption upon them, thelineaments bore a manifest likeness to those of John Carnby, and plainly theycould belong only to a twin brother.The frightful inferences that smothered my brain with their black and clammycloud are not to be written here. The horror which I beheld—and the greaterhorror which I surmised—would have put to shame hell’s foulest enormities intheir frozen pits. There was but one mitigation and one mercy: I was compelledto gaze only for a few instants on that intolerable scene. Then, all at once, Ifelt that something had withdrawn from the room; the malign spell was broken,the overpowering volition that had held me captive was gone. It had released menow, even as it had released the dismembered corpse of Helman Carnby. I was freeto go; and I fled from the ghastly chamber and ran headlong through an unlithouse and into the outer darkness of the night.* Originally published in Strange Tales, September 1931."},{"pageContent":"UBBO-SATHLA*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]CLARK ASHTON SMITH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]For Ubbo-Sathla is the source and the end. Before the coming of Zhothaqquah orYok-Zothoth or Kthulhut from the stars, Ubbo-Sathla dwelt in the steaming fensof the new-made Earth: a mass without head or members, spawning the grey,formless efts of the prime and the grisly prototypes of terrene life.… And allearthly life, it is told, shall go back at last through the great circle of timeto Ubbo-Sathla.—THE BOOK OF EIBONPaul Tregardis found the milky crystal in a litter of oddments from many landsand eras. He had entered the shop of the curio-dealer through an aimlessimpulse, with no object in mind, other than the idle distraction of eyeing andfingering a miscellany of far-gathered things. Looking desultorily about, hisattention had been drawn by a dull glimmering on one of the tables; and he hadextricated the queer orb-like stone from its shadowy, crowded position betweenan ugly little Aztec idol, the fossil egg of a dinornis, and an obscene fetishof black wood from the Niger.The thing was about the size of a small orange and was slightly flattened at theends, like a planet at its poles. It puzzled Tregardis, for it was not like anordinary crystal, being cloudy and changeable, with an intermittent glowing inits heart, as if it were alternately illumed and darkened from within. Holdingit to the wintry window, he studied it for a while without being able todetermine the secret of this singular and regular alternation. His puzzlementwas soon complicated by a dawning sense of vague and irrecognizable familiarity,as if he had seen the thing before under circumstances that were now whollyforgotten.He appealed to the curio-dealer, a dwarfish Hebrew with an air of dustyantiquity, who gave the impression of being lost to commercial considerations insome web of cabbalistic reverie.“Can you tell me anything about this?”The dealer gave an indescribable, simultaneous shrug of his shoulders and hiseyebrows.“It is very old—palaeogean, one might say. I cannot tell you much, for little isknown. A geologist found it in Greenland, beneath glacial ice, in the Miocenestrata. Who knows? It may have belonged to some sorcerer of primeval Thule.Greenland was a warm, fertile region beneath the sun of Miocene times. No doubtit is a magic crystal; and a man might behold strange visions in its heart, ifhe looked long enough.”Tregardis was quite startled; for the dealer’s apparently fantastic suggestionhad brought to mind his own delvings in a branch of obscure lore; and, inparticular, had recalled the Book of Eibon, that strangest and rarest of occultforgotten volumes, which is said to have come down through a series of manifoldtranslations from a prehistoric original written in the lost language ofHyperborea. Tregardis, with much difficulty, had obtained the mediaeval Frenchversion—a copy that had been owned by many generations of sorcerers andSatanists—but had never been able to find the Greek manuscript from which theversion was derived.The remote, fabulous original was supposed to have been the work of a greatHyperborean wizard, from whom it had taken its name. It was a collection of darkand baleful myths; of liturgies, rituals, and incantations both evil andesoteric. Not without shudders, in the course of studies that the average personwould have considered more than singular, Tregardis had collated the Frenchvolume with the frightful Necronomicon of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred. He hadfound many correspondences of the blackest and most appalling significance,together with much forbidden data that was either unknown to the Arab or omittedby him … or by his translators.Was this what he had been trying to recall, Tregardis wondered—the brief, casualreference, in the Book of Eibon, to a cloudy crystal that had been owned by thewizard Zon Mezzamalech, in Mhu Thulan? Of course, it was all too fantastic, toohypothetic, too incredible—but Mhu Thulan, that northern portion of ancientHyperborea, was supposed to have corresponded roughly with modern Greenland,which had formerly been joined as a peninsula to the main continent. Could thestone in his hand, by some fabulous fortuity, be the crystal of Zon Mezzamalech?Tregardis smiled at himself with inward irony for even conceiving the absurdnotion. Such things did not occur—at least, not in present-day London; and inall likelihood, the Book of Eibon was sheer superstitious fantasy, anyway.Nevertheless, there was something about the crystal that continued to tease andinveigle him. He ended by purchasing it, at a fairly moderate price. The sum wasnamed by the seller and paid by the buyer without bargaining.With the crystal in his pocket, Paul Tregardis hastened back to his lodgingsinstead of resuming his leisurely saunter. He installed the milky globe on hiswriting-table, where it stood firmly enough on one of its oblate ends. Then,still smiling at his own absurdity, he took down the yellow parchment manuscriptof the Book of Eibon from its place in a somewhat inclusive collection ofrecherché literature. He opened the vermiculated leather cover with hasps oftarnished steel, and read over to himself, translating from the archaic Frenchas he read, the paragraph that referred to Zon Mezzamalech:“This wizard, who was mighty among sorcerers, had found a cloudy stone, orb-likeand somewhat flattened at the ends, in which he could behold many visions of theterrene past, even to the Earth’s beginning, when Ubbo-Sathla, the unbegottensource, lay vast and swollen and yeasty amid the vaporing slime.… But of thatwhich he beheld, Zon Mezzamalech left little record; and people say that hevanished presently, in a way that is not known; and after him the cloudy crystalwas lost.”Paul Tregardis laid the manuscript aside. Again there was something thattantalized and beguiled him, like a lost dream or a memory forfeit to oblivion.Impelled by a feeling which he did not scrutinize or question, he sat downbefore the table and began to stare intently into the cold, nebulous orb. Hefelt an expectation which, somehow, was so familiar, so permeative a part of hisconsciousness, that he did not even name it to himself.Minute by minute he sat, and watched the alternate glimmering and fading of themysterious light in the heart of the crystal. By imperceptible degrees, therestole upon him a sense of dream-like duality, both in respect to his person andhis surroundings. He was still Paul Tregardis—and yet he was someone else; theroom was his London apartment—and a chamber in some foreign but well-knownplace. And in both milieus he peered steadfastly into the same crystal.After an interim, without surprise on the part of Tregardis, the process ofre-identification became complete. He knew that he was Zon Mezzamalech, asorcerer of Mhu Thulan, and a student of all lore anterior to his own epoch.Wise with dreadful secrets that were not known to Paul Tregardis, amateur ofanthropology and the occult sciences in latter-day London, he sought by means ofthe milky crystal to attain an even older and more fearful knowledge.He had acquired the stone in dubitable ways, from a more than sinister source.It was unique and without fellow in any land or time. In its depths, all formeryears, all things that had ever been, were supposedly mirrored, and would revealthemselves to the patient visionary. And through the crystal, Zon Mezzamalechhad dreamt to recover the wisdom of the gods who died before the Earth was born.They had passed to the lightless void, leaving their lore inscribed upon tabletsof ultra-stellar stone; and the tablets were guarded in the primal mire by theformless, idiotic demiurge, Ubbo-Sathla. Only by means of the crystal could hehope to find and read the tablets.For the first time, he was making trial of the globe’s reputed virtues. Abouthim an ivory-panelled chamber, filled with his magic books and paraphernalia,was fading slowly from his consciousness. Before him, on a table of some darkHyperborean wood that had been graven with grotesque ciphers, the crystalappeared to swell and deepen, and in its filmy depth he beheld a swift andbroken swirling of dim scenes, fleeting like the bubbles of a mill-race. As ifhe looked upon an actual world, cities, forests, mountains, seas, and meadowsflowed beneath him, lightening and darkening as with the passage of days andnights in some weirdly accelerated stream of time.Zon Mezzamalech had forgotten Paul Tregardis—had lost the remembrance of his ownentity and his own surroundings in Mhu Thulan. Moment by moment, the flowingvision in the crystal became more definite and distinct, and the orb itselfdeepened till he grew giddy, as if he were peering from an insecure height intosome never-fathomed abyss. He knew that time was racing backward in the crystal,was unrolling for him the pageant of all past days; but a strange alarm hadseized him, and he feared to gaze longer. Like one who has nearly fallen from aprecipice, he caught himself with a violent start and drew back from the mysticorb.Again, to his gaze, the enormous whirling world into which he had peered was asmall and cloudy crystal on his rune-wrought table in Mhu Thulan. Then, bydegrees, it seemed that the great room with sculptured panels of mammoth ivorywas narrowing to another and dingier place; and Zon Mezzamalech, losing hispreternatural wisdom and sorcerous power, went back by a weird regression intoPaul Tregardis.And yet not wholly, it seemed, was he able to return. Tregardis, dazed andwondering, found himself before the writing-table on which he had set the oblatesphere. He felt the confusion of one who has dreamt and has not yet fullyawakened from the dream. The room puzzled him vaguely, as if something werewrong with its size and furnishings; and his remembrance of purchasing thecrystal from a curio-dealer was oddly and discrepantly mingled with animpression that he had acquired it in a very different manner.He felt that something very strange had happened to him when he peered into thecrystal; but just what it was he could not seem to recollect. It had left him inthe sort of psychic muddlement that follows a debauch of hashish. He assuredhimself that he was Paul Tregardis, that he lived on a certain street in London,that the year was 1933; but such commonplace verities had somehow lost theirmeaning and their validity; and everything about him was shadow-like andinsubstantial. The very walls seemed to waver like smoke; the people in thestreets were phantoms of phantoms; and he himself was a lost shadow, a wanderingecho of something long forgot.He resolved that he would not repeat his experiment of crystalgazing. Theeffects were too unpleasant and equivocal. But the very next day, by anunreasoning impulse to which he yielded almost mechanically, withoutreluctation, he found himself seated before the misty orb. Again he became thesorcerer Zon Mezzamalech in Mhu Thulan; again he dreamt to retrieve the wisdomof the antemundane gods; again he drew back from the deepening crystal with theterror of one who fears to fall; and once more—but doubtfully and dimly, like afailing wraith—he was Paul Tregardis.Three times did Tregardis repeat the experience on successive days; and eachtime his own person and the world about him became more tenuous and confusedthan before. His sensations were those of a dreamer who is on the verge ofwaking; and London itself was unreal as the lands that slip from the dreamer’sken, receding in filmy mist and cloudy light. Beyond it all, he felt the loomingand crowding of vast imageries, alien but half familiar. It was as if thephantasmagoria of time and space were dissolving about him, to reveal someveritable reality—or another dream of space and time.There came, at last, the day when he sat down before the crystal—and did notreturn as Paul Tregardis. It was the day when Zon Mezzamalech, boldlydisregarding certain evil and portentous warnings, resolved to overcome hiscurious fear of falling bodily into the visionary world that he beheld—a fearthat had hitherto prevented him from following the backward stream of time forany distance. He must, he assured himself, conquer his fear if he were ever tosee and read the lost tablets of the gods. He had beheld nothing more than a fewfragments of the years of Mhu Thulan immediately posterior to the present—theyears of his own lifetime; and there were inestimable cycles between these yearsand the Beginning.Again, to his gaze, the crystal deepened immeasurably, with scenes andhappenings that flowed in a retrograde stream. Again the magic ciphers of thedark table faded from his ken, and the sorcerously carven walls of his chambermelted into less than dream. Once more he grew giddy with an awful vertigo as hebent above the swirling and milling of the terrible gulfs of time in theworld-like orb. Fearfully, in spite of his resolution, he would have drawn away;but he had looked and leaned too long. There was a sense of abysmal falling, asuction as of ineluctable winds, of maelstroms that bore him down through fleetunstable visions of his own past life into antenatal years and dimensions. Heseemed to endure the pangs of an inverse dissolution; and then he was no longerZon Mezzamalech, the wise and learned watcher of the crystal, but an actual partof the weirdly racing stream that ran back to re-attain the Beginning.He seemed to live unnumbered lives, to die myriad deaths, forgetting each timethe death and life that had gone before. He fought as a warrior inhalf-legendary battles; he was a child playing in the ruins of some olden cityof Mhu Thulan; he was the king who had reigned when the city was in its prime,the prophet who had foretold its building and its doom. A woman, he wept for thebygone dead in necropoli long-crumbled; an antique wizard, he muttered the rudespells of earlier sorcery; a priest of some pre-human god, he wielded thesacrificial knife in cave-temples of pillared basalt. Life by life, era by era,he retraced the long and groping cycles through which Hyperborea had risen fromsavagery to a high civilization.He became a barbarian of some troglodytic tribe, fleeing from the slow, turretedice of a former glacial age into lands illumed by the ruddy flare of perpetualvolcanoes. Then, after incomputable years, he was no longer man but a man-likebeast, roving in forests of giant fern and calamite, or building an uncouth nestin the boughs of mighty cycads.Through aeons of anterior sensation, of crude lust and hunger, of aboriginalterror and madness, there was someone—or something—that went ever backward intime. Death became birth, and birth was death. In a slow vision of reversechange, the Earth appeared to melt away, to slough off the hills and mountainsof its latter strata. Always the sun grew larger and hotter above the fumingswamps that teemed with a crasser life, with a more fulsome vegetation. And thething that had been Paul Tregardis, that had been Zon Mezzamalech, was a part ofall the monstrous devolution. It flew with the claw-tipped wings of apterodactyl, it swam in tepid seas with the vast, winding bulk of anichthyosaurus, it bellowed uncouthly with the armored throat of some forgottenbehemoth to the huge moon that burned through Liassic mists.At length, after aeons of immemorial brutehood, it became one of the lostserpent-men who reared their cities of black gneiss and fought their venomouswars in the world’s first continent. It walked undulously in antehuman streets,in strange crooked vaults; it peered at primeval stars from high, Babeliantowers; it bowed with hissing litanies to great serpent-idols. Through years andages of the ophidian era it returned, and was a thing that crawled in the ooze,that had not yet learned to think and dream and build. And the time came whenthere was no longer a continent, but only a vast, chaotic marsh, a sea of slime,without limit or horizon, that seethed with a blind writhing of amorphousvapors.There, in the grey beginning of Earth, the formless mass that was Ubbo-Sathlareposed amid the slime and the vapors. Headless, without organs or members, itsloughed from its oozy sides, in a slow, ceaseless wave, the amoebic forms thatwere the archetypes of earthly life. Horrible it was, if there had been aught toapprehend the horror; and loathsome, if there had been any to feel loathing.About it, prone or tilted in the mire, there lay the mighty tablets ofstar-quarried stone that were writ with the inconceivable wisdom of thepre-mundane gods.And there, to the goal of a forgotten search, was drawn the thing that he hadbeen—or would sometime be—Paul Tregardis and Zon Mezzamalech. Becoming ashapeless eft of the prime, it crawled sluggishly and obliviously across thefallen tablets of the gods, and fought and ravened blindly with the other spawnof Ubbo-Sathla.Of Zon Mezzamalech and his vanishing, there is no mention anywhere, save thebrief passage in the Book of Eibon. Concerning Paul Tregardis, who alsodisappeared, there was a curt notice in several London papers.

HOWARD[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]They say foul beings of Old Times still lurkIn dark forgotten corners of the world,And Gates still gape to loose, on certain nights,Shapes pent in Hell.—JUSTIN GEOFFREYI read of it first in the strange book of Von Junzt, the German eccentric wholived so curiously and died in such grisly and mysterious fashion. It was myfortune to have access to his Nameless Cults in the original edition, theso-called Black Book, published in Dusseldorf in 1839, shortly before a houndingdoom overtook the author. Collectors of rare literature are familiar withNameless Cults mainly through the cheap and faulty translation which was piratedin London by Bridewell in 1845, and the carefully expurgated edition put out bythe Golden Goblin Press of New York in 1909. But the volume I stumbled upon wasone of the unexpurgated German copies, with heavy leather covers and rusty ironhasps. I doubt if there are more than half a dozen such volumes in the entireworld today, for the quantity issued was not great, and when the manner of theauthor’s demise was bruited about, many possessors of the book burned theirvolumes in panic.Von Junzt spent his entire life (1795–1840) delving into forbidden subjects; hetraveled in all parts of the world, gained entrance into innumerable secretsocieties, and read countless little known and esoteric books and manuscripts inthe original; and in the chapters of the Black Book, which range from startlingclarity of exposition to murky ambiguity, there are statements and hints tofreeze the blood of a thinking man. Reading what Von Junzt dared put in printarouses uneasy speculations as to what it was that he dared not tell. What darkmatters, for instance, were contained in those closely written pages that formedthe unpublished manuscript on which he worked unceasingly for months before hisdeath, and which lay torn and scattered all over the floor of the locked andbolted chamber in which Von Junzt was found dead with the marks of talonedfingers on his throat? It will never be known, for the author’s closest friend,the Frenchman Alexis Ladeau, after having spent a whole night piecing thefragments together and reading what was written, burnt them to ashes and cut hisown throat with a razor.But the contents of the published matter are shuddersome enough, even if oneaccepts the general view that they but represent the ravings of a madman. Thereamong many strange things I found mention of the Black Stone, that curious,sinister monolith that broods among the mountains of Hungary, and about which somany dark legends cluster. Von Junzt did not devote much space to it—the bulk ofhis grim work concerns cults and objects of dark worship which he maintainedexisted in his day, and it would seem that the Black Stone represents some orderor being lost and forgotten centuries ago. But he spoke of it as one of thekeys—a phrase used many times by him, in various relations, and constituting oneof the obscurities of his work. And he hinted briefly at curious sights to beseen about the monolith on Midsummer Night. He mentioned Otto Dostmann’s theorythat this monolith was a remnant of the Hunnish invasion and had been erected tocommemorate a victory of Attila over the Goths. Von Junzt contradicted thisassertion without giving any refutatory facts, merely remarking that toattribute the origin of the Black Stone to the Huns was as logical as assumingthat William the Conqueror reared Stonehenge.This implication of enormous antiquity piqued my interest immensely, and aftersome difficulty I succeeded in locating a rat-eaten and moldering copy ofDostmann’s Remnants of Lost Empires (Berlin, 1809, “Der Drachenhaus” Press). Iwas disappointed to find that Dostmann referred to the Black Stone even morebriefly than had Von Junzt, dismissing it with a few lines as an artifactcomparatively modern in contrast with the Greco-Roman ruins of Asia Minor whichwere his pet theme. He admitted his inability to make out the defaced characterson the monolith but pronounced them unmistakably Mongoloid. However, little as Ilearned from Dostmann, he did mention the name of the village adjacent to theBlack Stone—Stregoicavar—an ominous name, meaning something like Witch-Town.A close scrutiny of guide-books and travel articles gave me no furtherinformation—Stregoicavar, not on any map that I could find, lay in a wild,little-frequented region, out of the path of casual tourists. But I did findsubject for thought in Dornly’s Magyar Folklore. In his chapter on “Dream Myths”he mentions the Black Stone and tells of some curious superstitions regardingit—especially the belief that if anyone sleeps in the vicinity of the monolith,that person will be haunted by monstrous nightmares forever after; and he citedtales of the peasants regarding too-curious people who ventured to visit theStone on Midsummer Night and who died raving mad because of something they sawthere.That was all I could glean from Dornly, but my interest was even more intenselyroused as I sensed a distinctly sinister aura about the Stone. The suggestion ofdark antiquity, the recurrent hint of unnatural events on Midsummer Night,touched some slumbering instinct in my being, as one senses, rather than hears,the flowing of some dark subterraneous river in the night.And I suddenly saw a connection between this Stone and a certain weird andfantastic poem written by the mad poet, Justin Geoffrey: “The People of theMonolith.” Inquiries led to the information that Geoffrey had indeed writtenthat poem while traveling in Hungary, and I could not doubt that the Black Stonewas the very monolith to which he referred in his strange verse. Reading hisstanzas again, I felt once more the strange dim stirrings of subconsciouspromptings that I had noticed when first reading of the Stone.I had been casting about for a place to spend a short vacation and I made up mymind. I went to Stregoicavar. A train of obsolete style carried me from Temesvárto within striking distance, at least, of my objective, and a three days’ ridein a jouncing coach brought me to the little village which lay in a fertilevalley high up in the fir-clad mountains. The journey itself was uneventful, butduring the first day we passed the old battlefield of Schomvaal where the bravePolish-Hungarian knight, Count Boris Vladinoff, made his gallant and futilestand against the victorious hosts of Suleiman the Magnificent, when the GrandTurk swept over eastern Europe in 1526.The driver of the coach pointed out to me a great heap of crumbling stones on ahill nearby, under which, he said, the bones of the brave Count lay. Iremembered a passage from Larson’s Turkish Wars: “After the skirmish” (in whichthe Count with his small army had beaten back the Turkish advance-guard) “theCount was standing beneath the half-ruined walls of the old castle on the hill,giving orders as to the disposition of his forces, when an aide brought to him asmall lacquered case which had been taken from the body of the famous Turkishscribe and historian, Selim Bahadur, who had fallen in the fight. The Count tooktherefrom a roll of parchment and began to read, but he had not read far beforehe turned very pale and, without saying a word, replaced the parchment in thecase and thrust the case into his cloak. At that very instant a hidden Turkishbattery suddenly opened fire, and the balls striking the old castle, theHungarians were horrified to see the walls crash down in ruin, completelycovering the brave Count. Without a leader the gallant little army was cut topieces, and in the war-swept years that followed, the bones of the nobleman werenever recovered. Today the natives point out a huge and moldering pile of ruinsnear Schomvaal beneath which, they say, still rests all that the centuries haveleft of Count Boris Vladinoff.”I found the village of Stregoicavar a dreamy, drowsy little village thatapparently belied its sinister cognomen—a forgotten back-eddy that Progress hadpassed by. The quaint houses and the quainter dress and manners of the peoplewere those of an earlier century. They were friendly, mildly curious but notinquisitive, though visitors from the outside world were extremely rare.“Ten years ago another American came here and stayed a few days in the village,”said the owner of the tavern where I had put up, “a young fellow andqueer-acting—mumbled to himself—a poet, I think.”I knew he must mean Justin Geoffrey.“Yes, he was a poet,” I answered, “and he wrote a poem about a bit of scenerynear this very village.”“Indeed?” Mine host’s interest was aroused. “Then, since all great poets arestrange in their speech and actions, he must have achieved great fame, for hisactions and conversations were the strangest of any man I ever knew.”“As is usual with artists,” I answered, “most of his recognition has come sincehis death.”“He is dead, then?”“He died screaming in a madhouse five years ago.”“Too bad, too bad,” sighed mine host sympathetically. “Poor lad—he looked toolong at the Black Stone.”My heart gave a leap, but I masked my keen interest and said casually: “I haveheard something of this Black Stone; somewhere near this village, is it not?”“Nearer than Christian folk wish,” he responded. “Look!” He drew me to alatticed window and pointed up at the fir-clad slopes of the brooding bluemountains. “There beyond where you see the bare face of that jutting cliffstands that accursed Stone. Would that it were ground to powder and the powderflung into the Danube to be carried to the deepest ocean! Once men tried todestroy the thing, but each man who laid hammer or maul against it came to anevil end. So now the people shun it.”“What is there so evil about it?” I asked curiously.“It is a demon-haunted thing,” he answered uneasily and with the suggestion of ashudder. “In my childhood I knew a young man who came up from below and laughedat our traditions—in his foolhardiness he went to the Stone one Midsummer Nightand at dawn stumbled into the village again, stricken dumb and mad. Somethinghad shattered his brain and sealed his lips, for until the day of his death,which came soon after, he spoke only to utter terrible blasphemies or to slavergibberish.“My own nephew when very small was lost in the mountains and slept in the woodsnear the Stone, and now in his manhood he is tortured by foul dreams, so that attimes he makes the night hideous with his screams and wakes with cold sweat uponhim.“But let us talk of something else, Herr; it is not good to dwell upon suchthings.”I remarked on the evident age of the tavern, and he answered with pride: “Thefoundations are more than four hundred years old; the original house was theonly one in the village which was not burned to the ground when Suleiman’sdevils swept through the mountains. Here, in the house that then stood on thesesame foundations, it is said, the scribe Selim Bahadur had his headquarterswhile ravaging the country hereabouts.”I learned then that the present inhabitants of Stregoicavar are not descendantsof the people who dwelt there before the Turkish raid of 1526. The victoriousMoslems left no living human in the village or the vicinity hereabouts when theypassed over. Men, women, and children they wiped out in one red holocaust ofmurder, leaving a vast stretch of country silent and utterly deserted. Thepresent people of Stregoicavar are descended from hardy settlers from the lowervalleys who came into the upper levels and rebuilt the ruined village after theTurk was thrust back.Mine host did not speak of the extermination of the original inhabitants withany great resentment, and I learned that his ancestors in the lower levels hadlooked on the mountaineers with even more hatred and aversion than they regardedthe Turks. He was rather vague regarding the causes of this feud, but said thatthe original inhabitants of Stregoicavar had been in the habit of makingstealthy raids on the lowlands and stealing girls and children. Moreover, hesaid that they were not exactly of the same blood as his own people; the sturdy,original Magyar-Slavic stock had mixed and intermarried with a degradedaboriginal race until the breeds had blended, producing an unsavoryamalgamation. Who these aborigines were, he had not the slightest idea, butmaintained that they were “pagans” and had dwelt in the mountains since timeimmemorial, before the coming of the conquering peoples.I attached little importance to this tale; seeing in it merely a parallel to theamalgamation of Celtic tribes with Mediterranean aborigines in the Gallowayhills, with the resultant mixed race which, as Picts, has such an extensive partin Scotch legendry. Time has a curiously foreshortening effect on folklore, andjust as tales of the Picts became intertwined with legends of an older Mongoloidrace, so eventually to the Picts was ascribed the repulsive appearance of thesquat primitives, whose individuality merged, in the telling, into Pictishtales, and was forgotten; so, I felt, the supposed inhuman attributes of thefirst villagers of Stregoicavar could be traced to older, outworn myths withinvading Huns and Mongols.The morning after my arrival I received directions from my host, who gave themworriedly, and set out to find the Black Stone. A few hours’ tramp up thefir-covered slopes brought me to the face of the rugged, solid stone cliff whichjutted boldly from the mountainside. A narrow trail wound up it, and mountingthis, I looked out over the peaceful valley of Stregoicavar, which seemed todrowse, guarded on either hand by the great blue mountains. No huts or any signof human tenancy showed between the cliffs whereon I stood and the village. Isaw numbers of scattering farms in the valley but all lay on the other side ofStregoicavar, which itself seemed to shrink from the brooding slopes whichmasked the Black Stone.The summit of the cliffs proved to be a sort of thickly wooded plateau. I mademy way through the dense growth for a short distance and came into a wide glade;and in the center of the glade reared a gaunt figure of black stone.It was octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and about a foot and ahalf thick. It had once evidently been highly polished, but now the surface wasthickly dinted as if savage efforts had been made to demolish it; but thehammers had done little more than to flake off small bits of stone and mutilatethe characters which once had evidently marched in a spiraling line round andround the shaft to the top. Up to ten feet from the base these characters werealmost completely blotted out, so that it was very difficult to trace theirdirection. Higher up they were plainer, and I managed to squirm part of the wayup the shaft and scan them at close range. All were more or less defaced, but Iwas positive that they symbolized no language now remembered on the face of theearth. I am fairly familiar with all hieroglyphics known to researchers andphilologists, and I can say with certainty that those characters were likenothing of which I have ever read or heard. The nearest approach to them that Iever saw were some crude scratches on a gigantic and strangely symmetrical rockin a lost valley of Yucatan. I remember that when I pointed out these marks tothe archaeologist who was my companion, he maintained that they eitherrepresented natural weathering or the idle scratching of some Indian. To mytheory that the rock was really the base of a long-vanished column, he merelylaughed, calling my attention to the dimensions of it, which suggested, if itwere built with any natural rules or architectural symmetry, a column a thousandfeet high. But I was not convinced.I will not say that the characters on the Black Stone were similar to those onthe colossal rock in Yucatan; but one suggested the other. As to the substanceof the monolith, again I was baffled. The stone of which it was composed was adully gleaming black, whose surface, where it was not dinted and roughened,created a curious illusion of semi-transparency.I spent most of the morning there and came away baffled. No connection of theStone with any other artifact in the world suggested itself to me. It was as ifthe monolith had been reared by alien hands, in an age distant and apart fromhuman ken.I returned to the village with my interest in no way abated. Now that I had seenthe curious thing, my desire was still more keenly whetted to investigate thematter further and seek to learn by what strange hands and for what strangepurpose the Black Stone had been reared in the long ago.I sought out the tavern-keeper’s nephew and questioned him in regard to hisdreams, but he was vague, though willing to oblige. He did not mind discussingthem, but was unable to describe them with any clarity. Though he dreamed thesame dreams repeatedly, and though they were hideously vivid at the time, theyleft no distinct impression on his waking mind. He remembered them only aschaotic nightmares through which huge whirling fires shot lurid tongues of flameand a black drum bellowed incessantly. One thing only he clearly remembered—inone dream he had seen the Black Stone, not on a mountain slope but set like aspire on a colossal black castle.As for the rest of the villagers I found them not inclined to talk about theStone, with the exception of the schoolmaster, a man of surprising education,who spent much more of his time out in the world than any of the rest.He was much interested in what I told him of Von Junzt’s remarks about theStone, and warmly agreed with the German author in the alleged age of themonolith. He believed that a coven had once existed in the vicinity and thatpossibly all of the original villagers had been members of that fertility cultwhich once threatened to undermine European civilization and gave rise to thetales of witchcraft. He cited the very name of the village to prove his point;it had not been originally named Stregoicavar, he said; according to legends thebuilders had called it Xuthltan, which was the aboriginal name of the site onwhich the village had been built many centuries ago.This fact roused again an indescribable feeling of uneasiness. The barbarousname did not suggest connection with any Scythic, Slavic, or Mongolian race towhich an aboriginal people of these mountains would, under naturalcircumstances, have belonged.That the Magyars and Slavs of the lower valleys believed the originalinhabitants of the village to be members of the witchcraft cult was evident, theschoolmaster said, by the name they gave it, which name continued to be usedeven after the older settlers had been massacred by the Turks, and the villagerebuilt by a cleaner and more wholesome breed.He did not believe that the members of the cult erected the monolith, but he didbelieve that they used it as a center of their activities, and repeating vaguelegends which had been handed down since before the Turkish invasion, headvanced the theory that the degenerate villagers had used it as a sort of altaron which they offered human sacrifices, using as victims the girls and babiesstolen from his own ancestors in the lower valleys.He discounted the myths of weird events on Midsummer Night, as well as a curiouslegend of a strange deity which the witch-people of Xuthltan were said to haveinvoked with chants and wild rituals of flagellation and slaughter.He had never visited the Stone on Midsummer Night, he said, but he would notfear to do so; whatever had existed or taken place there in the past, had beenlong engulfed in the mists of time and oblivion. The Black Stone had lost itsmeaning save as a link to a dead and dusty past.It was while returning from a visit with this schoolmaster one night about aweek after my arrival at Stregoicavar that a sudden recollection struck me—itwas Midsummer Night! The very time that the legends linked with grislyimplications to the Black Stone. I turned away from the tavern and strodeswiftly through the village. Stregoicavar lay silent; the villagers retiredearly. I saw no one as I passed rapidly out of the village and up into the firswhich masked the mountain slopes in a weird light and etched the shadowsblackly. No wind blew through the firs, but a mysterious, intangible rustlingand whispering was abroad. Surely on such nights in past centuries, my whimsicalimagination told me, naked witches astride magic broomsticks had flown acrossthis valley, pursued by jeering demoniac familiars.I came to the cliffs and was somewhat disquieted to note that the illusivemoonlight lent them a subtle appearance I had not noticed before—in the weirdlight they appeared less like natural cliffs and more like the ruins ofcyclopean and Titan-reared battlements jutting from the mountain slope.Shaking off this hallucination with difficulty, I came upon the plateau andhesitated a moment before I plunged into the brooding darkness of the woods. Asort of breathless tenseness hung over the shadows, like an unseen monsterholding its breath lest it scare away its prey.I shook off the sensation—a natural one, considering the eeriness of the placeand its evil reputation—and made my way through the wood, experiencing a mostunpleasant sensation that I was being followed, and halting once, sure thatsomething clammy and unstable had brushed against my face in the darkness.I came out into the glade and saw the tall monolith rearing its gaunt heightabove the sward. At the edge of the woods on the side toward the cliff was astone which formed a sort of natural seat. I sat down, reflecting that it wasprobably while there that the mad poet, Justin Geoffrey, had written hisfantastic “People of the Monolith.” Mine host thought that it was the Stonewhich had caused Geoffrey’s insanity, but the seeds of madness had been sown inthe poet’s brain long before he ever came to Stregoicavar.A glance at my watch showed that the hour of midnight was close at hand. Ileaned back, awaiting whatever ghostly demonstration might appear. A thin nightwind started up among the branches of the firs, with an uncanny suggestion offaint, unseen pipes whispering an eerie and evil tune. The monotony of the soundand my steady gazing at the monolith produced a sort of self-hypnosis upon me; Igrew drowsy. I fought this feeling, but sleep stole on me in spite of myself;the monolith seemed to sway and dance, strangely distorted to my gaze, and thenI slept.I opened my eyes and sought to rise, but lay still, as if an icy hand gripped mehelpless. Cold terror stole over me. The glade was no longer deserted. It wasthronged by a silent crowd of strange people, and my distended eyes took instrange barbaric details of costume which my reason told me were archaic andforgotten even in this backward land. Surely, I thought, these are villagers whohave come here to hold some fantastic conclave—but another glance told me thatthese people were not of the folk of Stregoicavar. They were a shorter, moresquat race, whose brows were lower, whose faces were broader and duller. Somehad Slavic or Magyar features, but those features were degraded as from amixture of some baser, alien strain I could not classify. Many wore the hides ofwild beasts, and their whole appearance, both men and women, was one of sensualbrutishness. They terrified and repelled me, but they gave me no heed. Theyformed in a vast half-circle in front of the monolith and began a sort of chant,flinging their arms in unison and weaving their bodies rhythmically from thewaist upward. All eyes were fixed on the top of the Stone, which they seemed tobe invoking. But the strangest of all was the dimness of their voices; not fiftyyards from me hundreds of men and women were unmistakably lifting their voicesin a wild chant, yet those voices came to me as a faint indistinguishable murmuras if from across vast leagues of Space—or time.Before the monolith stood a sort of brazier from which a vile, nauseous yellowsmoke billowed upward, curling curiously in an undulating spiral around theblack shaft, like a vast unstable serpent.On one side of this brazier lay two figures—a young girl, stark naked and boundhand and foot, and an infant, apparently only a few months old. On the otherside of the brazier squatted a hideous old hag with a queer sort of black drumon her lap; this drum she beat with slow, light blows of her open palms, but Icould not hear the sound.The rhythm of the swaying bodies grew faster, and into the space between thepeople and the monolith sprang a naked young woman, her eyes blazing, her longblack hair flying loose. Spinning dizzily on her toes, she whirled across theopen space and fell prostrate before the Stone, where she lay motionless. Thenext instant a fantastic figure followed her—a man from whose waist hung agoatskin, and whose features were entirely hidden by a sort of mask made from ahuge wolf’s head, so that he looked like a monstrous, nightmare being, horriblycompounded of elements both human and bestial. In his hand he held a bunch oflong fir switches bound together at the larger ends, and the moonlight glintedon a chain of heavy gold looped about his neck. A smaller chain depending fromit suggested a pendant of some sort, but this was missing.The people tossed their arms violently and seemed to redouble their shouts asthis grotesque creature loped across the open space with many a fantastic leapand caper. Coming to the woman who lay before the monolith, he began to lash herwith the switches he bore, and she leaped up and spun into the wild mazes of themost incredible dance I have ever seen. And her tormentor danced with her,keeping the wild rhythm, matching her every whirl and bound, while incessantlyraining cruel blows on her naked body. And at every blow he shouted a singleword, over and over, and all the people shouted it back. I could see the workingof their lips, and now the faint far-off murmur of their voices merged andblended into one distant shout, repeated over and over with slobbering ecstasy.But what that one word was, I could not make out.In dizzy whirls spun the wild dancers, while the lookers-on, standing still intheir tracks, followed the rhythm of their dance with swaying bodies and weavingarms. Madness grew in the eyes of the capering votaress and was reflected in theeyes of the watchers. Wilder and more extravagant grew the whirling frenzy ofthat mad dance—it became a bestial and obscene thing, while the old hag howledand battered the drum like a crazy woman, and the switches cracked out a devil’stune.Blood trickled down the dancer’s limbs, but she seemed not to feel the lashingsave as a stimulus for further enormities of outrageous motion; bounding intothe midst of the yellow smoke which now spread out tenuous tentacles to embraceboth flying figures, she seemed to merge with that foul fog and veil herselfwith it. Then emerging into plain view, closely followed by the beast-thing thatflogged her, she shot into an indescribable, explosive burst of dynamic madmotion, and on the very crest of that mad wave, she dropped suddenly to thesward, quivering and panting as if completely overcome by her frenziedexertions. The lashing continued with unabated violence and intensity, and shebegan to wriggle toward the monolith on her belly. The priest—or such I willcall him—followed, lashing her unprotected body with all the power of his arm asshe writhed along, leaving a heavy track of blood on the trampled earth. Shereached the monolith and, gasping and panting, flung both arms about it andcovered the cold stone with fierce hot kisses, as in frenzied and unholyadoration.The fantastic priest bounded high in the air, flinging away the red-dabbledswitches, and the worshippers, howling and foaming at the mouths, turned on eachother with tooth and nail, rending one another’s garments and flesh in a blindpassion of bestiality. The priest swept up the infant with a long arm, andshouting again that Name, whirled the wailing babe high in the air and dashedits brains out against the monolith, leaving a ghastly stain on the blacksurface. Cold with horror, I saw him rip the tiny body open with his barebrutish fingers and fling handfuls of blood on the shaft, then toss the red andtorn shape into the brazier, extinguishing flame and smoke in a crimson rain,while the maddened brutes behind him howled over and over that Name. Thensuddenly they all fell prostrate, writhing like snakes, while the priest flungwide his gory hands as in triumph. I opened my mouth to scream my horror andloathing, but only a dry rattle sounded; a huge monstrous toad-like thingsquatted on the top of the monolith!I saw its bloated, repulsive, and unstable outline against the moonlight, andset in what would have been the face of a natural creature, its huge, blinkingeyes which reflected all the lust, abysmal greed, obscene cruelty, and monstrousevil that has stalked the sons of men since their ancestors moved blind andhairless in the tree-tops. In those grisly eyes mirrored all the unholy thingsand vile secrets that sleep in the cities under the sea, and that skulk from thelight of day in the blackness of primordial caverns. And so that ghastly thingthat the unhallowed ritual of cruelty and sadism and blood had evoked from thesilence of the hills, leered and blinked down on its bestial worshippers, whogroveled in abhorrent abasement before it.Now the beast-masked priest lifted the bound and weakly writhing girl in hisbrutish hands and held her up toward that horror on the monolith. And as thatmonstrosity sucked in its breath, lustfully and slobberingly, something snappedin my brain and I fell into a merciful faint.I opened my eyes on a still white dawn. All the events of the night rushed backon me and I sprang up, then stared about me in amazement. The monolith broodedgaunt and silent above the sward which waved, green and untrampled, in themorning breeze. A few quick strides took me across the glade; here had thedancers leaped and bounded until the ground should have been trampled bare, andhere had the votaress wriggled her painful way to the Stone, streaming blood onthe earth. But no drop of crimson showed on the uncrushed sward. I looked,shudderingly, at the side of the monolith against which the bestial priest hadbrained the stolen baby—but no dark stain or grisly clot showed there.A dream! It had been a wild nightmare—or else—I shrugged my shoulders. Whatvivid clarity for a dream!I returned quietly to the village and entered the inn without being seen. Andthere I sat meditating over the strange events of the night. More and more was Iprone to discard the dream-theory. That what I had seen was illusion and withoutmaterial substance, was evident. But I believed that I had looked on themirrored shadow of a deed perpetrated in ghastly actuality in bygone days. Buthow was I to know? What proof to show that my vision had been a gathering offoul specters rather than a mere nightmare originating in my own brain?As if for answer a name flashed into my mind—Selim Bahadur! According to legendthis man, who had been a soldier as well as a scribe, had commanded that part ofSuleiman’s army which had devastated Stregoicavar. It seemed logical enough; andif so, he had gone straight from the blotted-out countryside to the bloody fieldof Schomvaal, and his doom. I sprang up with a sudden shout—that manuscriptwhich was taken from the Turk’s body, and which Count Boris shuddered over—mightit not contain some narration of what the conquering Turks found inStregoicavar? What else could have shaken the iron nerves of the Polishadventurer? And since the bones of the Count had never been recovered, what morecertain than that lacquered case, with its mysterious contents, still lay hiddenbeneath the ruins that covered Boris Vladinoff? I began packing my bag withfierce haste.* * *Three days later found me ensconced in a little village a few miles from the oldbattlefield, and when the moon rose I was working with savage intensity on thegreat pile of crumbling stone that crowned the hill. It was back-breakingtoil—looking back now I cannot see how I accomplished it, though I laboredwithout a pause from moonrise to dawn. Just as the sun was coming up I toreaside the last tangle of stones and looked on all that was mortal of Count BorisVladinoff—only a few pitiful fragments of crumbling bone—and among them, crushedout of all original shape, lay a case whose lacquered surface had kept it fromcomplete decay through the centuries.I seized it with frenzied eagerness, and piling back some of the stones on thebones I hurried away; for I did not care to be discovered by the suspiciouspeasants in an act of apparent desecration.Back in my tavern chamber I opened the case and found the parchmentcomparatively intact; and there was something else in the case—a small squatobject wrapped in silk. I was wild to plumb the secrets of those yellowed pages,but weariness forbade me. Since leaving Stregoicavar I had hardly slept at all,and the terrific exertions of the previous night combined to overcome me. Inspite of myself I was forced to stretch myself down on my bed, nor did I awakeuntil sundown.I snatched a hasty supper, and then in the light of a flickering candle, I setmyself to read the neat Turkish characters that covered the parchment. It wasdifficult work, for I am not deeply versed in the language and the archaic styleof the narrative baffled me. But as I toiled through it, a word or phrase hereand there leaped at me and a dimly growing horror shook me in its grip. I bentmy energies fiercely to the task, and as the tale grew clearer and took moretangible form my blood chilled in my veins, my hair stood up, and my tongueclove to my mouth. All external things partook of the grisly madness of thatinfernal manuscript until the night sounds of insects and creatures in the woodstook the form of ghastly murmurings and stealthy treadings of ghoulish horrorsand the sighing of the night wind changed to tittering obscene gloating of evilover the souls of men.At last when gray dawn was stealing through the latticed window, I laid down themanuscript and took up and unwrapped the thing in the bit of silk. Staring at itwith haggard eyes I knew the truth of the matter was clinched, even had it beenpossible to doubt the veracity of that terrible manuscript.And I replaced both obscene things in the case, nor did I rest or sleep or eatuntil that case containing them had been weighted with stones and flung into thedeepest current of the Danube which, God grant, carried them back into the Hellfrom which they came.It was no dream I dreamed on Midsummer Midnight in the hills above Stregoicavar.Well for Justin Geoffrey that he tarried there only in the sunlight and went hisway, for had he gazed upon that ghastly conclave, his mad brain would havesnapped before it did. How my own reason held, I do not know.No—it was no dream—I gazed upon a foul rite of votaries long dead, come up fromHell to worship as of old; ghosts that bowed before a ghost. For Hell has longclaimed their hideous god. Long, long he dwelt among the hills, abrain-shattering vestige of an outworn age, but no longer his obscene talonsclutch for the souls of living men, and his kingdom is a dead kingdom, peopledonly by the ghosts of those who served him in his lifetime and theirs.By what foul alchemy or godless sorcery the Gates of Hell are opened on that oneeerie night I do not know, but mine own eyes have seen. And I know I looked onno living thing that night, for the manuscript written in the careful hand ofSelim Bahadur narrated at length what he and his raiders found in the valley ofStregoicavar; and I read, set down in detail, the blasphemous obscenities thattorture wrung from the lips of screaming worshippers; and I read, too, of thelost, grim black cavern high in the hills where the horrified Turks hemmed amonstrous, bloated, wallowing toad-like being and slew it with flame and ancientsteel blessed in old times by Muhammad, and with incantations that were old whenArabia was young. And even staunch old Selim’s hand shook as he recorded thecataclysmic, earth-shaking death-howls of the monstrosity which died not alone;for a half-score of his slayers perished with him, in ways that Selim would notor could not describe.And that squat idol carved of gold and wrapped in silk was an image of himself,and Selim tore it from the golden chain that looped the neck of the slain highpriest of the mask.Well that the Turks swept that foul valley with torch and cleanly steel! Suchsights as those brooding mountains have looked on belong to the darkness andabysses of lost eons. No—it is not fear of the toad-thing that makes me shudderin the night. He is made fast in Hell with his nauseous horde, freed only for anhour on the most weird night of the year, as I have seen. And of hisworshippers, none remains.But it is the realization that such things once crouched beast-like above thesouls of men which brings cold sweat to my brow; and I fear to peer again intothe leaves of Von Junzt’s abomination. For now I understand his repeated phraseof keys!—age! Keys to Outer Doors—links with an abhorrent past and—who knows?—ofabhorrent spheres of the present. And I understand why the cliffs look likebattlements in the moonlight and why the tavern-keeper’s nightmare-hauntednephew saw, in his dream, the Black Stone like a spire on a cyclopean blackcastle. If men ever excavate among those mountains, they may find incrediblethings below those masking slopes. For the cave wherein the Turks trappedthe—thing—was not truly a cavern, and I shudder to contemplate the gigantic gulfof eons which must stretch between this age and the time when the earth shookherself and reared up, like a wave, those blue mountains that, rising, envelopedunthinkable things. May no man ever seek to uproot that ghastly spire men callthe Black Stone!A Key! Aye, it is a Key, symbol of a forgotten horror. That horror had fadedinto the limbo from which it crawled, loathsomely, in the black dawn of theearth. But what of the other fiendish possibilities hinted at by Von Junzt—whatof the monstrous hand which strangled out his life? Since reading what SelimBahadur wrote, I can no longer doubt anything in the Black Book. Man was notalways master of the earth—and is he now?And the thought recurs to me—if such a monstrous entity as the Master of theMonolith somehow survived its own unspeakably distant epoch so long—whatnameless shapes may even now lurk in the dark places of the world?* Originally published in Weird Tales, November 1931."},{"pageContent":"THE HOUNDS OF TINDALOS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]FRANK BELKNAP LONG[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]I“I’m glad you came,” said Chalmers. He was sitting by the window and his facewas very pale. Two tall candles guttered at his elbow and cast a sickly amberlight over his long nose and slightly receding chin. Chalmers would have nothingmodern about his apartment. He had the soul of a mediaeval ascetic, and hepreferred illuminated manuscripts to automobiles, and leering stone gargoyles toradios and adding-machines.As I crossed the room to the settee he had cleared for me, I glanced at his deskand was surprised to discover that he had been studying the mathematicalformulae of a celebrated contemporary physicist, and that he had covered manysheets of thin yellow paper with curious geometric designs.“Einstein and John Dee are strange bedfellows,” I said as my gaze wandered fromhis mathematical charts to the sixty or seventy quaint books that comprised hisstrange little library. Plotinus and Emanuel Moscopulus, St. Thomas Aquinas andFrenicle de Bessy stood elbow to elbow in the somber ebony bookcase, and chairs,table, and desk were littered with pamphlets about mediaeval sorcery andwitchcraft and black magic, and all of the valiant glamorous things that themodern world has repudiated.Chalmers smiled engagingly, and passed me a Russian cigarette on a curiouslycarved tray. “We are just discovering now,” he said, “that the old alchemistsand sorcerers were two-thirds right, and that your modern biologist andmaterialist is nine-tenths wrong.”“You have always scoffed at modern science,” I said, a little impatiently.“Only at scientific dogmatism,” he replied. “I have always been a rebel, achampion of originality and lost causes; that is why I have chosen to repudiatethe conclusions of contemporary biologists.”“And Einstein?” I asked.“A priest of transcendental mathematics!” he murmured reverently. “A profoundmystic and explorer of the great suspected.”“Then you do not entirely despise science.”“Of course not,” he affirmed. “I merely distrust the scientific positivism ofthe past fifty years, the positivism of Haeckel and Darwin and of Mr. BertrandRussell. I believe that biology has failed pitifully to explain the mystery ofman’s origin and destiny.”“Give them time,” I retorted.Chalmers’s eyes glowed. “My friend,” he murmured, “your pun is sublime. Givethem time. That is precisely what I would do. But your modern biologist scoffsat time. He has the key but he refuses to use it. What do we know of time,really? Einstein believes that it is relative, that it can be interpreted interms of space, of curved space. But must we stop there? When mathematics failsus can we not advance by—insight?”“You are treading on dangerous ground,” I replied. “That is a pitfall that yourtrue investigator avoids. That is why modern science has advanced so slowly. Itaccepts nothing that it cannot demonstrate. But you—”“I would take hashish, opium, all manner of drugs. I would emulate the sages ofthe East. And then perhaps I would apprehend—”“What?”“The fourth dimension.”“Theosophical rubbish!”“Perhaps. But I believe that drugs expand human consciousness. William Jamesagreed with me. And I have discovered a new one.”“A new drug?”“It was used centuries ago by Chinese alchemists, but it is virtually unknown inthe West. Its occult properties are amazing. With its aid and the aid of mymathematical knowledge I believe that I can go back through time.”“I do not understand.”“Time is merely our imperfect perception of a new dimension of space. Time andmotion are both illusions. Everything that has existed from the beginning of theworld exists now. Events that occurred centuries ago on this planet continue toexist in another dimension of space. Events that will occur centuries from nowexist already. We cannot perceive their existence because we cannot enter thedimension of space that contains them. Human beings as we know them are merelyfractions, infinitesimally small fractions of one enormous whole. Every humanbeing is linked with all the life that has preceded him on this planet. All ofhis ancestors are parts of him. Only time separates him from his forebears, andtime is an illusion and does not exist.”“I think I understand,” I murmured.“It will be sufficient for my purpose if you can form a vague idea of what Iwish to achieve. I wish to strip from my eyes the veils of illusion that timehas thrown over them, and see the beginning and the end.”“And you think this new drug will help you?”“I am sure that it will. And I want you to help me. I intend to take the drugimmediately. I cannot wait. I must see.” His eyes glittered strangely. “I amgoing back, back through time.”He rose and strode to the mantel. When he faced me again he was holding a smallsquare box in the palm of his hand. “I have here five pellets of the drug Liao.It was used by the Chinese philosopher Lao Tze, and while under its influence hevisioned Tao. Tao is the most mysterious force in the world; it surrounds andpervades all things; it contains the visible universe and everything that wecall reality. He who apprehends the mysteries of Tao sees clearly all that wasand will be.”“Rubbish!” I retorted.“Tao resembles a great animal, recumbent, motionless, containing in its enormousbody all the worlds of our universe, the past, the present, and the future. Wesee portions of this great monster through a slit, which we call time. With theaid of this drug I shall enlarge the slit. I shall behold the great figure oflife, the great recumbent beast in its entirety.”“And what do you wish me to do?”“Watch, my friend. Watch and take notes. And if I go back too far you mustrecall me to reality. You can recall me by shaking me violently. If I appear tobe suffering acute physical pain you must recall me at once.”“Chalmers,” I said, “I wish you wouldn’t make this experiment. You are takingdreadful risks. I don’t believe that there is any fourth dimension and Iemphatically do not believe in Tao. And I don’t approve of your experimentingwith unknown drugs.”“I know the properties of this drug,” he replied. “I know precisely how itaffects the human animal and I know its dangers. The risk does not reside in thedrug itself. My only fear is that I may become lost in time. You see, I shallassist the drug. Before I swallow this pellet I shall give my undividedattention to the geometric and algebraic symbols that I have traced on thispaper.” He raised the mathematical chart that rested on his knee. “I shallprepare my mind for an excursion into time. I shall approach the fourthdimension with my conscious mind before I take the drug which will enable me toexercise occult powers of perception. Before I enter the dream world of theEastern mystic I shall acquire all of the mathematical help that modern sciencecan offer. This mathematical knowledge, this conscious approach to an actualapprehension of the fourth dimension of time, will supplement the work of thedrug. The drug will open up stupendous new vistas—the mathematical preparationwill enable me to grasp them intellectually. I have often grasped the fourthdimension in dreams, emotionally, intuitively, but I have never been able torecall, in waking life, the occult splendors that were momentarily revealed tome.“But with your aid, I believe that I can recall them. You will take downeverything that I say while I am under the influence of the drug. No matter howstrange or incoherent my speech may become you will omit nothing. When I awake Imay be able to supply the key to whatever is mysterious or incredible. I am notsure that I shall succeed, but if I do succeed”—his eyes were strangelyluminous—“time will exist for me no longer!”He sat down abruptly. “I shall make the experiment at once. Please stand overthere by the window and watch. Have you a fountain pen?”I nodded gloomily and removed a pale green Waterman from my upper vest pocket.“And a pad, Frank?”I groaned and produced a memorandum book. “I emphatically disapprove of thisexperiment,” I muttered. “You’re taking a frightful risk.”“Don’t be an asinine old woman!” he admonished. “Nothing that you can say willinduce me to stop now. I entreat you to remain silent while I study thesecharts.”He raised the charts and studied them intently. I watched the clock on themantel as it ticked out the seconds, and a curious dread clutched at my heart sothat I choked.Suddenly the clock stopped ticking, and exactly at that moment Chalmersswallowed the drug.I rose quickly and moved toward him, but his eyes implored me not to interfere.“The clock has stopped,” he murmured. “The forces that control it approve of myexperiment. Time stopped, and I swallowed the drug. I pray God that I shall notlose my way.”He closed his eyes and leaned back on the sofa. All of the blood had left hisface and he was breathing heavily. It was clear that the drug was acting withextraordinary rapidity.“It is beginning to get dark,” he murmured. “Write that. It is beginning to getdark and the familiar objects in the room are fading out. I can discern themvaguely through my eyelids, but they are fading swiftly.”I shook my pen to make the ink come and wrote rapidly in shorthand as hecontinued to dictate.“I am leaving the room. The walls are vanishing and I can no longer see any ofthe familiar objects. Your face, though, is still visible to me. I hope that youare writing. I think that I am about to make a great leap—a leap through space.Or perhaps it is through time that I shall make the leap. I cannot tell.Everything is dark, indistinct.”He sat for a while silent, with his head sunk upon his breast. Then suddenly hestiffened and his eyelids fluttered open. “God in heaven!” he cried. “I see!”He was straining forward in his chair, staring at the opposite wall. But I knewthat he was looking beyond the wall and that the objects in the room no longerexisted for him. “Chalmers,” I cried, “Chalmers, shall I wake you?”“Do not!” he shrieked. “I see everything. All of the billions of lives thatpreceded me on this planet are before me at this moment. I see men of all ages,all races, all colors. They are fighting, killing, building, dancing, singing.They are sitting about rude fires on lonely gray deserts, and flying through theair in monoplanes. They are riding the seas in bark canoes and enormoussteamships; they are painting bison and mammoths on the walls of dismal cavesand covering huge canvases with queer futuristic designs. I watch the migrationsfrom Atlantis. I watch the migrations from Lemuria. I see the elder races—astrange horde of black dwarfs overwhelming Asia, and the Neanderthalers withlowered heads and bent knees ranging obscenely across Europe. I watch theAchaeans streaming into the Greek islands, and the crude beginnings of Hellenicculture. I am in Athens and Pericles is young. I am standing on the soil ofItaly. I assist in the rape of the Sabines; I march with the Imperial Legions. Itremble with awe and wonder as the enormous standards go by and the groundshakes with the tread of the victorious hastati. A thousand naked slaves grovelbefore me as I pass in a litter of gold and ivory drawn by night-black oxen fromThebes, and the flower-girls scream ‘Ave Caesar’ as I nod and smile. I am myselfa slave on a Moorish galley. I watch the erection of a great cathedral. Stone bystone it rises, and through months and years I stand and watch each stone as itfalls into place. I am burned on a cross head downward in the thyme-scentedgardens of Nero, and I watch with amusement and scorn the torturers at work inthe chambers of the Inquisition.“I walk in the holiest sanctuaries; I enter the temples of Venus. I kneel inadoration before the Magna Mater, and I throw coins on the bare knees of thesacred courtesans who sit with veiled faces in the groves of Babylon. I creepinto an Elizabethan theater and with the stinking rabble about me I applaud TheMerchant of Venice. I walk with Dante through the narrow streets of Florence. Imeet the young Beatrice, and the hem of her garment brushes my sandals as Istare enraptured. I am a priest of Isis, and my magic astounds the nations.Simon Magus kneels before me, imploring my assistance, and Pharaoh trembles whenI approach. In India I talk with the Masters and run screaming from theirpresence, for their revelations are as salt on wounds that bleed.“I perceive everything simultaneously. I perceive everything from all sides; Iam a part of all the teeming billions about me. I exist in all men and all menexist in me. I perceive the whole of human history in a single instant, the pastand the present.“By simply straining I can see farther and farther back. Now I am going backthrough strange curves and angles. Angles and curves multiply about me. Iperceive great segments of time through curves. There is curved time, andangular time. The beings that exist in angular time cannot enter curved time. Itis very strange.“I am going back and back. Man has disappeared from the earth. Gigantic reptilescrouch beneath enormous palms and swim through the loathly black waters ofdismal lakes. Now the reptiles have disappeared. No animals remain upon theland, but beneath the waters, plainly visible to me, dark forms move slowly overthe rotting vegetation.“These forms are becoming simpler and simpler. Now they are single cells. Allabout me there are angles—strange angles that have no counterparts on the earth.I am desperately afraid.“There is an abyss of being which man has never fathomed.”I stared. Chalmers had risen to his feet and he was gesticulating helplesslywith his arms. “I am passing through unearthly angles; I am approaching—oh, theburning horror of it.”“Chalmers!” I cried. “Do you wish me to interfere?”He brought his right hand quickly before his face, as though to shut out avision unspeakable. “Not yet!” he cried “I will go on. I willsee—what—lies—beyond—”A cold sweat streamed from his forehead and his shoulders jerked spasmodically.“Beyond life there are”—his face grew ashen with terror—“things that I cannotdistinguish. They move slowly through angles. They have no bodies, and they moveslowly through outrageous angles.”It was then that I became aware of the odor in the room. It was a pungent,indescribable odor, so nauseous that I could scarcely endure it. I steppedquickly to the window and threw it open. When I returned to Chalmers and lookedinto his eyes I nearly fainted.“I think they have scented me!” he shrieked. “They are slowly turning towardme.”He was trembling horribly. For a moment he clawed at the air with his hands.Then his legs gave way beneath him and he fell forward on his face, slobberingand moaning.I watched him in silence as he dragged himself across the floor. He was nolonger a man. His teeth were bared and saliva dripped from the corners of hismouth.“Chalmers,” I cried. “Chalmers, stop it! Stop it, do you hear?”As if in reply to my appeal he commenced to utter hoarse convulsive sounds whichresembled nothing so much as the barking of a dog, and began a sort of hideouswrithing in a circle about the room. I bent and seized him by the shoulders.Violently, desperately, I shook him. He turned his head and snapped at my wrist.I was sick with horror, but I dared not release him for fear that he woulddestroy himself in a paroxysm of rage.“Chalmers,” I muttered, “you must stop that. There is nothing in this room thatcan harm you. Do you understand?”I continued to shake and admonish him, and gradually the madness died out of hisface. Shivering convulsively, he crumpled into a grotesque heap on the Chineserug.I carried him to the sofa and deposited him upon it. His features were twistedin pain, and I knew that he was still struggling dumbly to escape fromabominable memories.“Whiskey,” he muttered. “You’ll find a flask in the cabinet by thewindow—upper-left-hand drawer.”When I handed him the flask his fingers tightened about it until the knucklesshowed blue. “They nearly got me,” he gasped. He drained the stimulant inimmoderate gulps, and gradually the color crept back into his face.“That drug was the very devil!” I murmured.“It wasn’t the drug,” he moaned.His eyes no longer glared insanely, but he still wore the look of a lost soul.“They scented me in time,” he moaned. “I went too far.”“What were they like?” I said, to humor him.He leaned forward and gripped my arm. He was shivering horribly. “No words inour language can describe them!” He spoke in a hoarse whisper. “They aresymbolized vaguely in the myth of the Fall, and in an obscene form which isoccasionally found engraved on ancient tablets. The Greeks had a name for them,which veiled their essential foulness. The tree, the snake, and the apple—theseare the vague symbols of a most awful mystery.”His voice had risen to a scream. “Frank, Frank, a terrible and unspeakable deedwas done in the beginning. Before time, the deed, and from the deed—”He had risen and was hysterically pacing the room. “The deeds of the dead movethrough angles in dim recesses of time. They are hungry andathirst!”“Chalmers,” I pleaded to quiet him. “We are living in the third decade of theTwentieth Century.”“They are lean and athirst!” he shrieked. “The Hounds of Tindalos!”“Chalmers, shall I phone for a physician?”“A physician cannot help me now. They are horrors of the soul, and yet”—he hidhis face in his hands and groaned—“they are real, Frank. I saw them for aghastly moment. For a moment I stood on the other side. I stood on the pale grayshores beyond time and space. In an awful light that was not light, in a silencethat shrieked, I saw them.“All the evil in the universe was concentrated in their lean, hungry bodies. Orhad they bodies? I saw them only for a moment; I cannot be certain. But I heardthem breathe. Indescribably for a moment I felt their breath upon my face. Theyturned toward me and I fled screaming. In a single moment I fled screamingthrough time. I fled down quintillions of years.“But they scented me. Men awake in them cosmic hungers. We have escaped,momentarily, from the foulness that rings them round. They thirst for that in uswhich is clean, which emerged from the deed without stain. There is a part of uswhich did not partake in the deed, and that they hate. But do not imagine thatthey are literally, prosaically evil. They are beyond good and evil as we knowit. They are that which in the beginning fell away from cleanliness. Through thedeed they became bodies of death, receptacles of all foulness. But they are notevil in our sense because in the spheres through which they move there is nothought, no moral, no right or wrong as we understand it. There is merely thepure and the foul. The foul expresses itself through angles; the pure throughcurves. Man, the pure part of him, is descended from a curve. Do not laugh. Imean that literally.”I rose and searched for my hat. “I’m dreadfully sorry for you, Chalmers,” Isaid, as I walked toward the door. “But I don’t intend to stay and listen tosuch gibberish. I’ll send my physician to see you. He’s an elderly, kindly chap,and he won’t be offended if you tell him to go to the devil. But I hope you’llrespect his advice. A week’s rest in a good sanitarium should benefit youimmeasurably.”I heard him laughing as I descended the stairs, but his laughter was so utterlymirthless that it moved me to tears.IIWhen Chalmers phoned the following morning my first impulse was to hang up thereceiver immediately. His request was so unusual and his voice was so wildlyhysterical that I feared any further association with him would result in theimpairment of my own sanity. But I could not doubt the genuineness of hismisery, and when he broke down completely and I heard him sobbing over the wire,I decided to comply with his request.“Very well,” I said. “I will come over immediately and bring the plaster.”En route to Chalmers’s home I stopped at a hardware store and purchased twentypounds of plaster of Paris. When I entered my friend’s room he was crouching bythe window watching the opposite wall out of eyes that were feverish withfright. When he saw me he rose and seized the parcel containing the plaster withan avidity that amazed and horrified me. He had extruded all of the furniture,and the room presented a desolate appearance.“It is just conceivable that we can thwart them!” he exclaimed. “But we mustwork rapidly. Frank, there is a stepladder in the hall. Bring it hereimmediately. And then fetch a pail of water.”“What for?” I murmured.He turned sharply and there was a flush on his face. “To mix the plaster, youfool!” he cried. “To mix the plaster that will save our bodies and souls from acontamination unmentionable. To mix the plaster that will save the worldfrom—Frank, they must be kept out!”“Who?” I murmured.“The Hounds of Tindalos!” he muttered. “They can only reach us through angles.We must eliminate all angles from this room. I shall plaster up all of thecorners, all of the crevices. We must make this room resemble the interior of asphere.”I knew that it would have been useless to argue with him. I fetched thestepladder, Chalmers mixed the plaster, and for three hours we labored. Wefilled in the four corners of the wall and the intersections of the floor andwall and the wall and ceiling, and we rounded the sharp angles of thewindow-seat.“I shall remain in this room until they return in time,” he affirmed when ourtask was completed. “When they discover that the scent leads through curves theywill return. They will return ravenous and snarling and unsatisfied to thefoulness that was in the beginning, before time, beyond space.”He nodded graciously and lit a cigarette. “It was good of you to help,” he said.“Will you not see a physician, Chalmers?” I pleaded.“Perhaps—tomorrow,” he murmured. “But now I must watch and wait.”“Wait for what?” I urged.Chalmers smiled wanly. “I know that you think me insane,” he said. “You have ashrewd but prosaic mind, and you cannot conceive of an entity that does notdepend for its existence on force and matter. But did it ever occur to you, myfriend, that force and matter are merely the barriers to perception imposed bytime and space? When one knows, as I do, that time and space are identical andthat they are both deceptive because they are merely imperfect manifestations ofa higher reality, one no longer seeks in the visible world for an explanation ofthe mystery and terror of being.”I rose and walked toward the door.“Forgive me,” he cried. “I did not mean to offend you. You have a superlativeintellect, but I—I have a superhuman one. It is only natural that I should beaware of your limitations.”“Phone if you need me,” I said, and descended the stairs two steps at a time.“I’ll send my physician over at once,” I muttered, to myself. “He’s a hopelessmaniac, and heaven knows what will happen if someone doesn’t take charge of himimmediately.”IIIThe following is a condensation of two announcements which appeared in thePartridgeville Gazette for July 3, 1928:EARTHQUAKE SHAKES FINANCIAL DISTRICTAt 2 o’clock this morning an earth tremor of unusual severity broke severalplate-glass windows in Central Square and completely disorganized the electricand street railway systems. The tremor was felt in the outlying districts, andthe steeple of the First Baptist Church on Angell Hill (designed by ChristopherWren in 1717) was entirely demolished. Firemen are now attempting to put out ablaze which threatens to destroy the Partridgeville Glue Works. An investigationis promised by the mayor, and an immediate attempt will be made to fixresponsibility for this disastrous occurrence.OCCULT WRITER MURDERED BY UNKNOWN GUESTHORRIBLE CRIME IN CENTRAL SQUAREMystery Surrounds Death of Halpin ChalmersAt 9 A.M. today the body of Halpin Chalmers, author and journalist, was found inan empty room above the jewelry store of Smithwick and Isaacs, 24 CentralSquare. The coroner’s investigation revealed that the room had been rentedfurnished to Mr. Chalmers on May 1, and that he had himself disposed of thefurniture a fortnight ago. Chalmers was the author of several recondite books onoccult themes, and a member of the Bibliographic Guild. He formerly resided inBrooklyn, New York.At 7 A.M. Mr. L. E. Hancock, who occupies the apartment opposite Chalmers’s roomin the Smithwick and Isaacs establishment, smelt a peculiar odor when he openedhis door to take in his cat and the morning edition of the PartridgevilleGazette. The odor he describes as extremely acrid and nauseous, and he affirmsthat it was so strong in the vicinity of Chalmers’s room that he was obliged tohold his nose when he approached that section of the hall.He was about to return to his own apartment when it occurred to him thatChalmers might have accidentally forgotten to turn off the gas in hiskitchenette. Becoming considerably alarmed at the thought, he decided toinvestigate, and when repeated tappings on Chalmers’s door brought no responsehe notified the superintendent. The latter opened the door by means of a passkey, and the two men quickly made their way into Chalmers’s room. The room wasutterly destitute of furniture, and Hancock asserts that when he first glancedat the floor his heart went cold within him, and that the superintendent,without saying a word, walked to the open window and stared at the buildingopposite for fully five minutes.Chalmers lay stretched upon his back in the center of the room. He was starklynude, and his chest and arms were covered with a peculiar bluish pus or ichor.His head lay grotesquely upon his chest. It had been completely severed from hisbody, and the features were twisted and torn and horribly mangled. Nowhere wasthere a trace of blood.The room presented a most astonishing appearance. The intersections of thewalls, ceiling, and floor had been thickly smeared with plaster of Paris, but atintervals fragments had cracked and fallen off, and someone had grouped theseupon the floor about the murdered man so as to form a perfect triangle.Beside the body were several sheets of charred yellow paper. These borefantastic geometric designs and symbols and several hastily scrawled sentences.The sentences were almost illegible and so absurd in content that they furnishedno possible clue to the perpetrator of the crime. “I am waiting and watching,”Chalmers wrote. “I sit by the window and watch walls and ceiling. I do notbelieve they can reach me, but I must beware of the Doels. Perhaps they can helpthem break through. The satyrs will help, and they can advance through thescarlet circles. The Greeks knew a way of preventing that. It is a great pitythat we have forgotten so much.”On another sheet of paper, the most badly charred of the seven or eightfragments found by Detective-Sergeant Douglas (of the Partridgeville Reserve),was scrawled the following:“Good God, the plaster is falling! A terrific shock has loosened the plaster andit is falling. An earthquake perhaps! I never could have anticipated this. It isgrowing dark in the room. I must phone Frank. But can he get here in time? Iwill try. I will recite the Einstein formula. I will—God, they are breakingthrough! They are breaking through! Smoke is pouring from the corners of thewall. Their tongues—ahhhh—”In the opinion of Detective-Sergeant Douglas, Chalmers was poisoned by someobscure chemical. He has sent specimens of the strange blue slime found onChalmers’s body to the Partridgeville Chemical Laboratories; and he expects thereport will shed new light on one of the most mysterious crimes of recent years.That Chalmers entertained a guest on the evening preceding the earthquake iscertain, for his neighbor distinctly heard a low murmur of conversation in theformer’s room as he passed it on his way to the stairs. Suspicion pointsstrongly to this unknown visitor, and the police are diligently endeavoring todiscover his identity.IVReport of James Morton, chemist and bacteriologist:My dear Mr. Douglas:The fluid sent to me for analysis is the most peculiar that I have everexamined. It resembles living protoplasm, but it lacks the peculiar substancesknown as enzymes. Enzymes catalyze the chemical reactions occurring in livingcells, and when the cell dies they cause it to disintegrate by hydrolyzation.Without enzymes protoplasm should possess enduring vitality, i.e., immortality.Enzymes are the negative components, so to speak, of the unicellular organism,which is the basis of all life. That living matter can exist without enzymesbiologists emphatically deny. And yet the substance that you have sent me isalive and it lacks these “indispensable” bodies. Good God, sir, do you realizewhat astounding new vistas this opens up?VExcerpt from The Secret Watcher by the late Halpin Chalmers:What if, parallel to the life we know, there is another life that does not die,which lacks the elements that destroy our life? Perhaps in another dimensionthere is a different force from that which generates our life. Perhaps thisforce emits energy, or something similar to energy, which passes from theunknown dimension where it is and creates a new form of cell life in ourdimension. No one knows that such new cell life does exist in our dimension. Ah,but I have seen its manifestations. I have talked with them. In my room at nightI have talked with the Doels. And in dreams I have seen their maker. I havestood on the dim shore beyond time and matter and seen it. It moves throughstrange curves and outrageous angles. Someday I shall travel in time and meet itface to face.* Originally published in Weird Tales, March 1929."},{"pageContent":"THE SPACE-EATERS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]FRANK BELKNAP LONG[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]The cross is not a passive agent. It protects the pure of heart, and it hasoften appeared in the air above our sabbats, confusing and dispersing the powersof Darkness.—JOHN DEE’S NecronomiconIThe horror came to Partridgeville in a blind fog.All that afternoon thick vapors from the sea had swirled and eddied about thefarm, and the room in which we sat swam with moisture. The fog ascended inspirals from beneath the door, and its long, moist fingers caressed my hairuntil it dripped. The square-paned windows were coated with a thick, dewlikemoisture; the air was heavy and dank and unbelievably cold.I stared gloomily at my friend. He had turned his back to the window and waswriting furiously. He was a tall, slim man with a slight stoop and abnormallybroad shoulders. In profile his face was impressive. He had an extremely broadforehead, long nose, and slightly protuberant chin—a strong, sensitive facewhich suggested a wildly imaginative nature held in restraint by a skeptical andtruly extraordinary intellect.My friend wrote short stories. He wrote to please himself, in defiance ofcontemporary taste, and his tales were unusual. They would have delighted Poe;they would have delighted Hawthorne, or Ambrose Bierce, or Villiers del’Isle-Adam. They were studies of abnormal men, abnormal beasts, abnormalplants. He wrote of remote realms of imagination and horror, and the colors,sounds, and odors which he dared to evoke were never seen, heard, or smelt onthe familiar side of the moon. He projected his creations against mind-chillingbackgrounds. They stalked through tall and lonely forests, over raggedmountains, and slithered down the stairs of ancient houses, and between thepiles of rotting black wharves.One of his tales, “The House of the Worm,” had induced a young student at aMidwestern university to seek refuge in an enormous redbrick building whereeveryone approved of his sitting on the floor and shouting at the top of hisvoice: “Lo, my beloved is fairer than all the lilies among the lilies in thelily garden.” Another, “The Defilers,” had brought him precisely one hundred andten letters of indignation from local readers when it appeared in thePartridgeville Gazette.As I continued to stare at him he suddenly stopped writing and shook his head.“I can’t do it,” he said. “I should have to invent a new language. And yet I cancomprehend the thing emotionally, intuitively, if you will. If I could onlyconvey it in a sentence somehow—the strange crawling of its fleshless spirit!”“Is it some new horror?” I asked.He shook his head. “It is not new to me. I have known and felt it for years—ahorror utterly beyond anything your prosaic brain can conceive.”“Thank you,” I said.“All human brains are prosaic,” he elaborated. “I meant no offense. It is theshadowy terrors that lurk behind and above them that are mysterious and awful.Our little brains—what can they know of vampire-like entities which may lurk indimensions higher than our own, or beyond the universe of stars? I thinksometimes they lodge in our heads, and our brains feel them, but when theystretch out tentacles to probe and explore us, we go screaming mad.” He wasstaring at me steadily now.“But you can’t honestly believe in such nonsense!” I exclaimed.“Of course not!” He shook his head and laughed. “You know damn well I’m tooprofoundly skeptical to believe in anything. I have merely outlined a poet’sreactions to the universe. If a man wishes to write ghostly stories and actuallyconvey a sensation of horror, he must believe in everything—and anything. Byanything I mean the horror that transcends everything, that is more terrible andimpossible than everything. He must believe that there are things from outerspace that can reach down and fasten themselves on us with a malevolence thatcan destroy us utterly—our bodies as well as our minds.”“But this thing from outer space—how can he describe it if he doesn’t know itsshape—or size or color?”“It is virtually impossible to describe it. That is what I have sought to do—andfailed. Perhaps someday—but then, I doubt if it can ever be accomplished. Butyour artist can hint, suggest.…”“Suggest what?” I asked, a little puzzled.“Suggest a horror that is utterly unearthly; that makes itself felt in termsthat have no counterparts on Earth.”I was still puzzled. He smiled wearily and elaborated his theory.“There is something prosaic,” he said, “about even the best of the classic talesof mystery and terror. Old Mrs. Radcliffe, with her hidden vaults and bleedingghosts; Maturin, with his allegorical Faust-like hero-villains, and his fieryflames from the mouth of hell; Edgar Poe, with his blood-clotted corpses, andblack cats, his telltale hearts and disintegrating Valdemars; Hawthorne, withhis amusing preoccupation with the problems and horrors arising from mere humansin (as though human sins were of any significance to a coldly malignintelligence from beyond the stars). Then we have modern masters—AlgernonBlackwood, who invites us to a feast of the high gods and shows us an old womanwith a harelip sitting before a ouija board fingering soiled cards, or an absurdnimbus of ectoplasm emanating from some clairvoyant ninny; Bram Stoker with hisvampires and werewolves, mere conventional myths, the tag-ends of mediaevalfolklore; Wells with his pseudo-scientific bogies, fish-men at the bottom of thesea, ladies in the moon, and the hundred and one idiots who are constantlywriting ghost stories for the magazines—what have they contributed to theliterature of the unholy?“Are we not made of flesh and blood? It is but natural that we should berevolted and horrified when we are shown that flesh and blood in a state ofcorruption and decay, with the worms passing over and under it. It is butnatural that a story about a corpse should thrill us, fill us with fear andhorror and loathing. Any fool can awake these emotions in us—Poe reallyaccomplished very little with his Lady Ushers, and liquescent Valdemars. Heappealed to simple, natural, understandable emotions, and it was inevitable thathis readers should respond.“Are we not the descendants of barbarians? Did we not once dwell in tall andsinister forests, at the mercy of beasts that rend and tear? It is butinevitable that we should shiver and cringe when we meet in literature darkshadows from our own past. Harpies and vampires and werewolves—what are they butmagnifications, distortions of the great birds and bats and ferocious dogs thatharassed and tortured our ancestors? It is easy enough to arouse fear by suchmeans. It is easy enough to frighten men with the flames at the mouth of hell,because they are hot and shrivel and burn the flesh—and who does not understandand dread a fire? Blows that kill, fires that burn, shadows that horrify becausetheir substances lurk evilly in the black corridors of our inherited memories—Iam weary of the writers who would terrify us by such pathetically obvious andtrite unpleasantness.”Real indignation blazed in his eyes.“Suppose there were a greater horror? Suppose evil things from some otheruniverse should decide to invade this one? Suppose we couldn’t see them? Supposewe couldn’t feel them? Suppose they were of a color unknown on Earth, or rather,of an appearance that was without color?“Suppose they had a shape unknown on Earth? Suppose they were four-dimensional,five-dimensional, six-dimensional? Suppose they were a hundred-dimensional?Suppose they had no dimensions at all and yet existed? What could we do?“They would not exist for us? They would exist for us if they gave us pain.Suppose it was not the pain of heat or cold or any of the pains we know, but anew pain? Suppose they touched something besides our nerves—reached our brainsin a new and terrible way? Suppose they made themselves felt in a new andstrange and unspeakable way? What could we do? Our hands would be tied. Youcannot oppose what you cannot see or feel. You cannot oppose thethousand-dimensional. Suppose they should eat their way to us through space!”He was speaking now with an intensity of emotion which belied his avowedskepticism of a moment before.“That is what I have tried to write about. I wanted to make my readers feel andsee that thing from another universe, from beyond space. I could easily enoughhint at it or suggest it—any fool can do that—but I wanted actually to describeit. To describe a color that is not a color! a form that is formless!“A mathematician could perhaps slightly more than suggest it. There would bestrange curves and angles that an inspired mathematician in a wild frenzy ofcalculation might glimpse vaguely. It is absurd to say that mathematicians havenot discovered the fourth dimension. They have often glimpsed it, oftenapproached it, often apprehended it, but they are unable to demonstrate it. Iknow a mathematician who swears that he once saw the sixth dimension in a wildflight into the sublime skies of the differential calculus.“Unfortunately I am not a mathematician. I am only a poor fool of a creativeartist, and the thing from outer space utterly eludes me.”Someone was pounding loudly on the door. I crossed the room and drew back thelatch. “What do you want?” I asked. “What is the matter?”“Sorry to disturb you, Frank,” said a familiar voice, “but I’ve got to talk tosomeone.”I recognized the lean, white face of my nearest neighbor, and stepped instantlyto one side. “Come in,” I said. “Come in, by all means. Howard and I have beendiscussing ghosts, and the things we’ve conjured up aren’t pleasant company.Perhaps you can argue them away.”I called Howard’s horrors ghosts because I didn’t want to shock my commonplaceneighbor. Henry Wells was immensely big and tall, and as he strode into the roomhe seemed to bring a part of the night with him.He collapsed on a sofa and surveyed us with frightened eyes. Howard laid downthe story he had been reading, removed and wiped his glasses, and frowned. Hewas more or less tolerant of my bucolic visitors. We waited for perhaps aminute, and then the three of us spoke almost simultaneously. “A horriblenight!” “Beastly, isn’t it?” “Wretched.”Henry Wells frowned. “Tonight,” he said, “I—I met with a funny accident. I wasdriving Hortense through Mulligan Wood.…”“Hortense?” Howard interrupted.“His horse,” I explained impatiently. “You were returning from Brewster, weren’tyou, Henry?”“From Brewster, yes,” he replied. “I was driving between the trees, keeping asharp lookout for cars with their lights on too bright, coming right at me outof the murk, and listening to the foghorns in the bay wheezing and moaning, whensomething wet landed on my head. ‘Rain,’ I thought. ‘I hope the supplies keepdry.’“I turned round to make sure that the butter and flour were covered up, andsomething soft like a sponge rose up from the bottom of the wagon and hit me inthe face. I snatched at it and caught it between my fingers.“In my hands it felt like jelly. I squeezed it, and moisture ran out of it downmy wrists. It wasn’t so dark that I couldn’t see it, either. Funny how you cansee in fogs—they seem to make the night lighter. There was a sort of brightnessin the air. I dunno, maybe it wasn’t the fog, either. The trees seemed to standout. You could see them sharp and clear. As I was saying, I looked at the thing,and what do you think it looked like? Like a piece of raw liver. Or like acalf’s brain. Now that I come to think of it, it was more like a calf’s brain.There were grooves in it, and you don’t find many grooves in liver. Liver’susually as smooth as glass.“It was an awful moment for me. ‘There’s someone up in one of those trees,’ Ithought. ‘He’s some tramp or crazy man or fool, and he’s been eating liver. Mywagon frightened him and he dropped it—a piece of it. I can’t be wrong. Therewas no liver in my wagon when I left Brewster.’“I looked up. You know how tall all of the trees are in Mulligan Wood. You can’tsee the tops of some of them from the wagon-road on a clear day. And you knowhow crooked and queer-looking some of the trees are.“It’s funny, but I’ve always thought of them as old men—tall old men, youunderstand, tall and crooked and very evil. I’ve always thought of them aswanting to work mischief. There’s something unwholesome about trees that growvery close together and grow crooked.“I looked up.“At first I didn’t see anything but the tall trees, all white and glisteningwith the fog, and above them a thick, white mist that hid the stars. And thensomething long and white ran quickly down the trunk of one of the trees.“It ran so quickly down the tree that I couldn’t see it clearly. And it was sothin anyway that there wasn’t much to see. But it was like an arm. It was like along, white, and very thin arm. But of course it wasn’t an arm. Who ever heardof an arm as tall as a tree? I don’t know what made me compare it to an arm,because it was really nothing but a thin line—like a wire, a string. I’m notsure that I saw it at all. Maybe I imagined it. I’m not even sure that it was aswide as a string. But it had a hand. Or didn’t it? When I think of it my braingets dizzy. You see, it moved so quickly I couldn’t see it clearly at all.“But it gave me the impression that it was looking for something that it haddropped. For a minute the hand seemed to spread out over the road, and then itleft the tree and came toward the wagon. It was like a huge white hand walkingon its fingers with a terribly long arm fastened to it that went up and up untilit touched the fog, or perhaps until it touched the stars.“I screamed and slashed Hortense with the reins, but the horse didn’t need anyurging. She was up and off before I could throw the liver, or calf’s brain, orwhatever it was, into the road. She raced so fast she almost upset the wagon,but I didn’t draw in the reins. I’d rather lie in a ditch with a broken rib thanhave a long, white hand squeezing the breath out of my throat.“We had almost cleared the wood and I was just beginning to breathe again whenmy brain went cold. I can’t describe what happened in any other way. My braingot as cold as ice inside my head. I can tell you I was frightened.“Don’t imagine I couldn’t think clearly. I was conscious of everything that wasgoing on about me, but my brain was so cold I screamed with the pain. Have youever held a piece of ice in the palm of your hand for as long as two or threeminutes? It burnt, didn’t it? Ice burns worse than fire. Well, my brain felt asthough it had lain on ice for hours and hours. There was a furnace inside myhead, but it was a cold furnace. It was roaring with raging cold.“Perhaps I should have been thankful that the pain didn’t last. It wore off inabout ten minutes, and when I got home I didn’t think I was any the worse for myexperience. I’m sure I didn’t think I was any the worse until I looked at myselfin the glass. Then I saw the hole in my head.”Henry Wells leaned forward and brushed back the hair from his right temple.“Here is the wound,” he said. “What do you make of it?” He tapped with hisfingers beneath a small round opening in the side of his head. “It’s like abullet-wound,” he elaborated, “but there was no blood and you can look in prettyfar. It seems to go right in to the center of my head. I shouldn’t be alive.”Howard had risen and was staring at my neighbor with angry and accusing eyes.“Why have you lied to us?” he shouted. “Why have you told us this absurd story?A long hand! You were drunk, man. Drunk—and yet you’ve succeeded in doing whatI’d have sweated blood to accomplish. If I could have made my readers feel thathorror, know it for a moment, that horror that you described in the woods, Ishould be with the immortals—I should be greater than Poe, greater thanHawthorne. And you—a clumsy drunken liar …”I was on my feet with a furious protest.“He’s not lying,” I said. “He’s been shot—someone has shot him in the head. Lookat this wound. My God, man, you have no call to insult him!”Howard’s wrath died and the fire went out of his eyes. “Forgive me,” he said.“You can’t imagine how badly I’ve wanted to capture that ultimate horror, to putit on paper, and he did it so easily. If he had warned me that he was going todescribe something like that I would have taken notes. But of course he doesn’tknow he’s an artist. It was an accidental tour de force that he accomplished; hecouldn’t do it again, I’m sure. I’m sorry I went up in the air—I apologize. Doyou want me to go for a doctor? That is a bad wound.”My neighbor shook his head. “I don’t want a doctor,” he said. “I’ve seen adoctor. There’s no bullet in my head—that hole was not made by a bullet. Whenthe doctor couldn’t explain it, I laughed at him. I hate doctors; and I haven’tmuch use for fools who think I’m in the habit of lying. I haven’t much use forpeople who won’t believe me when I tell ’em I saw the long, white thing comesliding down the tree as clear as day.”But Howard was examining the wound in defiance of my neighbor’s indignation. “Itwas made by something round and sharp,” he said. “It’s curious, but the fleshisn’t torn. A knife or bullet would have torn the flesh, left a ragged edge.”I nodded, and was bending to study the wound when Wells shrieked, and clappedhis hands to his head. “Ah-h-h!” he choked. “It’s come back—the terrible,terrible cold.”Howard stared. “Don’t expect me to believe such nonsense!” he exclaimeddisgustedly.But Wells was holding on to his head and dancing about the room in a delirium ofagony. “I can’t stand it!” he shrieked. “It’s freezing up my brain. It’s notlike ordinary cold. It isn’t. Oh, God! It’s like nothing you’ve ever felt. Itbites, it scorches, it tears. It’s like acid.”I laid my hand upon his shoulder and tried to quiet him, but he pushed me asideand made for the door.“I’ve got to get out of here,” he screamed. “The thing wants room. My head won’thold it. It wants the night—the vast night. It wants to wallow in the night.”He threw back the door and disappeared into the fog. Howard wiped his foreheadwith the sleeve of his coat and collapsed into a chair.“Mad,” he muttered. “A tragic case of manic-depressive psychosis. Who would havesuspected it? The story he told us wasn’t conscious art at all. It was simply anightmare-fungus conceived by the brain of a lunatic.”“Yes,” I said, “but how do you account for the hole in his head?”“Oh, that!” Howard shrugged. “He probably always had it—probably was born withit.”“Nonsense,” I said. “The man never had a hole in his head before. Personally, Ithink he’s been shot. Something ought to be done. He needs medical attention. Ithink I’ll phone Dr. Smith.”“It is useless to interfere,” said Howard. “That hole was not made by a bullet.I advise you to forget him until tomorrow. His insanity may be temporary, it maywear off; and then he’d blame us for interfering. If he’s still emotionallydisturbed tomorrow, if he comes here again and tries to make trouble, you cannotify the proper authorities. Has he ever acted queerly before?”“No,” I said. “He was always quite sane. I think I’ll take your advice and wait.But I wish I could explain the hole in his head.”“The story he told interests me more,” said Howard. “I’m going to write it outbefore I forget it. Of course I shan’t be able to make the horror as real as hedid, but perhaps I can catch a bit of the strangeness and glamour.”He unscrewed his fountain pen and began to cover a sheet of paper with curiousphrases.I shivered and closed the door.For several minutes there was no sound in the room save the scratching of hispen as it moved across the paper. For several minutes there was silence—and thenthe shrieks commenced. Or were they wails?We heard them through the closed door, heard them above the moaning of thefoghorns and the wash of the waves on Mulligan’s Beach. We heard them above themillion sounds of night that had horrified and depressed us as we sat and talkedin that fog-enshrouded and lonely house. We heard them so clearly that for amoment we thought they came from just outside the house. It was not until theycame again and again—long, piercing wails—that we discovered in them a qualityof remoteness. Slowly we became aware that the wails came from far away, as faraway, perhaps, as Mulligan Wood.“A soul in torture,” muttered Howard. “A poor, damned soul in the grip of thehorror I’ve been telling you about—the horror I’ve known and felt for years.”He rose unsteadily to his feet. His eyes were shining and he was breathingheavily.I seized his shoulders and shook him. “You shouldn’t project yourself into yourstories that way,” I exclaimed. “Some poor chap is in distress. I don’t knowwhat’s happened. Perhaps a ship foundered. I’m going to put on a slicker andfind out what it’s all about. I have an idea we may be needed.”“We may be needed,” repeated Howard slowly. “We may be needed indeed. It willnot be satisfied with a single victim. Think of that great journey throughspace, the thirst and dreadful hungers it must have known! It is preposterous toimagine that it will be content with a single victim!”Then, suddenly, a change came over him. The light went out of his eyes and hisvoice lost its quiver. He shivered.“Forgive me,” he said. “I’m afraid you’ll think I’m as mad as the yokel who washere a few minutes ago. But I can’t help identifying myself with my characterswhen I write. I’d described something very evil, and those yells—well, they areexactly like the yells a man would make if—if.…”“I understand,” I interrupted, “but we’ve no time to discuss that now. There’s apoor chap out there”—I pointed vaguely toward the door—“with his back againstthe wall. He’s fighting off something—I don’t know what. We’ve got to help him.”“Of course, of course,” he agreed, and followed me into the kitchen.Without a word I took down a slicker and handed it to him. I also handed him anenormous rubber hat.“Get into these as quickly as you can,” I said. “The chap’s desperately in needof us.”I had gotten my own slicker down from the rack and was forcing my arms throughits sticky sleeves. In a moment we were both pushing our way through the fog.The fog was like a living thing. Its long fingers reached up and slapped usrelentlessly on the face. It curled about our bodies and ascended in great,grayish spirals from the tops of our heads. It retreated before us, and assuddenly closed in and enveloped us.Dimly ahead of us we saw the lights of a few lonely farms. Behind us the seadrummed, and the foghorns sent out a continuous, mournful ululation. The collarof Howard’s slicker was turned up over his ears, and from his long nose moisturedripped. There was grim decision in his eyes, and his jaw was set.For many minutes we plodded on in silence, and it was not until we approachedMulligan Wood that he spoke.“If necessary,” he said, “we shall enter the wood.”I nodded. “There is no reason why we should not enter the wood,” I said. “Itisn’t a large wood.”“One could get out quickly?”“One could get out very quickly indeed. My God, did you hear that?”The shrieks had grown horribly loud.“He is suffering,” said Howard. “He is suffering terribly. Do you suppose—do yousuppose it’s your crazy friend?”He had voiced a question which I had been asking myself for some time.“It’s conceivable,” I said. “But we’ll have to interfere if he’s as mad as that.I wish I’d brought some of the neighbors with me.”“Why in heaven’s name didn’t you?” Howard shouted. “It may take a dozen men tohandle him.” He was staring at the tall trees that towered before us, and Ididn’t think he really gave Henry Wells so much as a thought.“That’s Mulligan Wood,” I said. I swallowed to keep my heart from rising to thetop of my mouth. “It isn’t a big wood,” I added idiotically.“Oh, my God!” Out of the fog there came the sound of a voice in the lastextremity of pain. “They’re eating up my brain. Oh, my God!”I was at that moment in deadly fear that I might become as mad as the man in thewoods. I clutched Howard’s arm.“Let’s go back,” I shouted. “Let’s go back at once. We were fools to come. Thereis nothing here but madness and suffering and perhaps death.”“That may be,” said Howard, “but we’re going on.”His face was ashen beneath his dripping hat, and his eyes were thin blue slits.“Very well,” I said grimly. “We’ll go on.”Slowly we moved among the trees. They towered above us, and the thick fog sodistorted them and merged them together that they seemed to move forward withus. From their twisted branches the fog hung in ribbons. Ribbons, did I say?Rather were they snakes of fog—writhing snakes with venomous tongues and leeringeyes. Through swirling clouds of fog we saw the scaly, gnarled boles of thetrees, and every bole resembled the twisted body of an evil old man. Only thesmall oblong of light cast by my electric torch protected us against theirmalevolence.Through great banks of fog we moved, and every moment the screams grew louder.Soon we were catching fragments of sentences, hysterical shoutings that mergedinto prolonged wails. “Colder and colder and colder … they are eating up mybrain. Colder! Ah-h-h!”Howard gripped my arm. “We’ll find him,” he said. “We can’t turn back now.”When we found him he was lying on his side. His hands were clasped about hishead, and his body was bent double, the knees drawn up so tightly that theyalmost touched his chest. He was silent. We bent and shook him, but he made nosound.“Is he dead?” I choked out. I wanted desperately to turn and run. The trees werevery close to us.“I don’t know,” said Howard. “I don’t know. I hope that he is dead.”I saw him kneel and slide his hand under the poor devil’s shirt. For a momenthis face was a mask. Then he got up quickly and shook his head.“He is alive,” he said. “We must get him into some dry clothes as quickly aspossible.”I helped him. Together we lifted the bent figure from the ground and carried itforward between the trees. Twice we stumbled and nearly fell, and the creeperstore at our clothes. The creepers were little malicious hands grasping andtearing under the malevolent guidance of the great trees. Without a star toguide us, without a light except the little pocket lamp which was growing dim,we fought our way out of Mulligan Wood.The droning did not commence until we had left the wood. At first we scarcelyheard it, it was so low, like the purring of gigantic engines far down in theearth. But slowly, as we stumbled forward with our burden, it grew so loud thatwe could not ignore it.“What is that?” muttered Howard, and through the wraiths of fog I saw that hisface had a greenish tinge.“I don’t know,” I mumbled. “It’s something horrible. I never heard anything likeit. Can’t you walk faster?”So far we had been fighting familiar horrors, but the droning and humming thatrose behind us was like nothing that I had ever heard on Earth. In excruciatingfright, I shrieked aloud. “Faster, Howard, faster! For God’s sake, let’s get outof this!”As I spoke, the body that we were carrying squirmed, and from its cracked lipsissued a torrent of gibberish: “I was walking between the trees looking up. Icouldn’t see their tops. I was looking up, and then suddenly I looked down andthe thing landed on my shoulders. It was all legs—all long, crawling legs. Itwent right into my head. I wanted to get away from the trees, but I couldn’t. Iwas alone in the forest with the thing on my back, in my head, and when I triedto run, the trees reached out and tripped me. It made a hole so it could get in.It’s my brain it wants. Today it made a hole, and now it’s crawled in and it’ssucking and sucking and sucking. It’s as cold as ice and it makes a noise like agreat big fly. But it isn’t a fly. And it isn’t a hand. I was wrong when Icalled it a hand. You can’t see it. I wouldn’t have seen or felt it if it hadn’tmade a hole and got in. You almost see it, you almost feel it, and that meansthat it’s getting ready to go in.”“Can you walk, Wells? Can you walk?”Howard had dropped Wells’s legs, and I could hear the harsh intake of his breathas he struggled to rid himself of his slicker.“I think so,” Wells sobbed. “But it doesn’t matter. It’s got me now. Put me downand save yourselves.”“We’ve got to run!” I yelled.“It’s our one chance,” cried Howard. “Wells, you follow us. Follow us, do youunderstand? They’ll burn up your brain if they catch you. We’re going to run,lad. Follow us!”He was off through the fog. Wells shook himself free, and followed like a man ina trance. I felt a horror more terrible than death. The noise was dreadfullyloud; it was right in my ears, and yet for a moment I couldn’t move. The wall offog was growing thicker.“Frank will be lost!” It was the voice of Wells, raised in a despairing shout.“We’ll go back!” It was Howard shouting now. “It’s death, or worse, but we can’tleave him.”“Keep on,” I called out. “They won’t get me. Save yourselves!”In my anxiety to prevent them from sacrificing themselves I plunged wildlyforward. In a moment I had joined Howard and was clutching at his arm.“What is it?” I cried. “What have we to fear?”The droning was all about us now, but no louder.“Come quickly or we’ll be lost!” he urged frantically. “They’ve broken down allbarriers. That buzzing is a warning. We’re sensitives—we’ve been warned, but ifit gets louder we’re lost. They’re strong near Mulligan Wood, and it’s herethey’ve made themselves felt. They’re experimenting now—feeling their way.Later, when they’ve learned, they’ll spread out. If we can only reach thefarm.…”“We’ll reach the farm!” I shouted as I clawed my way through the fog.“Heaven help us if we don’t!” moaned Howard.He had thrown off his slicker, and his seeping wet shirt clung tragically to hislean body. He moved through the blackness with long, furious strides. Far aheadwe heard the shrieks of Henry Wells. Ceaselessly the foghorns moaned;ceaselessly the fog swirled and eddied about us.And the droning continued. It seemed incredible that we should ever have found away to the farm in the blackness. But find the farm we did, and into it westumbled with glad cries.“Shut the door!” shouted Howard.I shut the door.“We are safe here, I think,” he said. “They haven’t reached the farm yet.”“What has happened to Wells?” I gasped, and then I saw the wet tracks leadinginto the kitchen.Howard saw them too. His eyes flashed with momentary relief.“I’m glad he’s safe,” he muttered. “I feared for him.”Then his face darkened. The kitchen was unlighted and no sound came from it.Without a word Howard walked across the room and into the darkness beyond. Isank into a chair, flicked the moisture from my eyes, and brushed back my hair,which had fallen in soggy strands across my face. For a moment I sat, breathingheavily, and when the door creaked, I shivered. But I remembered Howard’sassurance: “They haven’t reached the farm yet. We’re safe here.”Somehow, I had confidence in Howard. He realized that we were threatened by anew and unknown horror, and in some occult way he had grasped its limitations.I confess, though, that when I heard the screams that came from the kitchen, myfaith in my friend was slightly shaken. There were low growls, such as I couldnot believe came from any human throat, and the voice of Howard raised in wildexpostulation. “Let go, I say! Are you quite mad? Man, man, we have saved you!Don’t, I say—let go of my leg. Ah-h-h!”As Howard staggered into the room I sprang forward and caught him in my arms. Hewas covered with blood from head to foot, and his face was ashen.“He’s gone raving mad,” he moaned. “He was running about on his hands and kneeslike a dog. He sprang at me, and almost killed me. I fought him off, but I’mbadly bitten. I hit him in the face—knocked him unconscious. I may have killedhim. He’s an animal—I had to protect myself.”I laid Howard on the sofa and knelt beside him, but he scorned my aid.“Don’t bother with me!” he commanded. “Get a rope, quickly, and tie him up. Ifhe comes to, we’ll have to fight for our lives.”What followed was a nightmare. I remember vaguely that I went into the kitchenwith a rope and tied poor Wells to a chair; then I bathed and dressed Howard’swounds, and lit a fire in the grate. I remember also that I telephoned for adoctor. But the incidents are confused in my memory, and I have no clearrecollection of anything until the arrival of a tall, grave man with kindly andsympathetic eyes and a presence that was as soothing as an opiate.He examined Howard, nodded, and explained that the wounds were not serious. Heexamined Wells, and did not nod. He explained slowly, “His pupils don’t respondto light,” he said. “An immediate operation will be necessary. I tell youfrankly, I don’t think we can save him.”“That wound in his head, Doctor,” I said. “Was it made by a bullet?”The doctor frowned. “It puzzles me,” he said. “Of course it was made by abullet, but it should have partially closed up. It goes right into the brain.You say you know nothing about it. I believe you, but I think the authoritiesshould be notified at once. Someone will be wanted for manslaughter, unless”—hepaused—“unless the wound was self-inflicted. What you tell me is curious. Thathe should have been able to walk about for hours seems incredible. The wound hasobviously been dressed, too. There is no clotted blood at all.”He paced slowly back and forth. “We must operate here—at once. There is a slightchance. Luckily, I brought some instruments. We must clear this table and—do youthink you could hold a lamp for me?”I nodded. “I’ll try,” I said.“Good!”The doctor busied himself with preparations while I debated whether or not Ishould phone for the police.“I’m convinced,” I said at last, “that the wound was self-inflicted. Wells actedvery strangely. If you are willing, Doctor.…”“Yes?”“We will remain silent about this matter until after the operation. If Wellslives, there would be no need of involving the poor chap in a policeinvestigation.”The doctor nodded. “Very well,” he said. “We will operate first and decideafterward.”Howard was laughing silently from his couch. “The police,” he snickered. “Ofwhat use would they be against the things in Mulligan Wood?”There was an ironic and ominous quality about his mirth that disturbed me. Thehorrors that we had known in the fog seemed absurd and impossible in the cool,scientific presence of Dr. Smith, and I didn’t want to be reminded of them.The doctor turned from his instruments and whispered into my ear. “Your friendhas a slight fever, and apparently it has made him delirious. If you will bringme a glass of water I will mix him a sedative.”I raced to secure a glass, and in a moment we had Howard sleeping soundly.“Now then,” said the doctor as he handed me the lamp. “You must hold this steadyand move it about as I direct.”The white, unconscious form of Henry Wells lay upon the table that the doctorand I had cleared, and I trembled all over when I thought of what lay before me:I should be obliged to stand and gaze into the living brain of my poor friend asthe doctor relentlessly laid it bare.With swift, experienced fingers the doctor administered an anesthetic. I wasoppressed by a dreadful feeling that we were committing a crime, that HenryWells would have violently disapproved, that he would have preferred to die. Itis a dreadful thing to mutilate a man’s brain. And yet I knew that the doctor’sconduct was above reproach, and that the ethics of his profession demanded thathe operate.“We are ready,” said Dr. Smith. “Lower the lamp. Carefully now!”I saw the knife moving in his competent, swift fingers. For a moment I stared,and then I turned my head away. What I had seen in that brief glance made mesick and faint. It may have been fancy, but as I stared at the wall I had theimpression that the doctor was on the verge of collapse. He made no sound, but Iwas almost certain that he had made some horrible discovery.“Lower the lamp,” he said. His voice was hoarse and seemed to come from far downwithin his throat.I lowered the lamp an inch without turning my head. I waited for him to reproachme, to swear at me perhaps, but he was as silent as the man on the table. Iknew, though, that his fingers were still at work, for I could hear them as theymoved about. I could hear his swift, agile fingers moving about the head ofHenry Wells.I suddenly became conscious that my hand was trembling. I wanted to lay down thelamp; I felt that I could no longer hold it.“Are you nearly through?” I gasped in desperation.“Hold that lamp steady!” The doctor screamed the command. “If you move that lampagain—I—I won’t sew him up. I don’t care if they hang me! I’m not a healer ofdevils!”I knew not what to do. I could scarcely hold the lamp, and the doctor’s threathorrified me.“Do everything you can,” I urged, hysterically. “Give him a chance to fight hisway back. He was kind and good—once!”For a moment there was silence, and I feared that he would not heed me. Imomentarily expected him to throw down his scalpel and sponge, and dash acrossthe room and out into the fog. It was not until I heard his fingers moving aboutagain that I knew he had decided to give even the damned a chance.It was after midnight when the doctor told me that I could lay down the lamp. Iturned with a cry of relief and encountered a face that I shall never forget. Inthree-quarters of an hour the doctor had aged ten years. There were dark hollowsbeneath his eyes, and his mouth twitched convulsively.“He’ll not live,” he said. “He’ll be dead in an hour. I did not touch his brain.I could do nothing. When I saw—how things were—I—I—sewed him up immediately.”“What did you see?” I half-whispered.A look of unutterable fear came into the doctor’s eyes. “I saw—I saw.…” Hisvoice broke and his whole body quivered. “I saw … oh, the burning shame ofit … evil that is without shape, that is formless.…”Suddenly he straightened and looked wildly about him.“They will come here and claim him!” he cried. “They have laid their mark uponhim and they will come for him. You must not stay here. This house is marked fordestruction!”I watched him helplessly as he seized his hat and bag and crossed to the door.With white, shaking fingers he drew back the latch, and in a moment his leanfigure was silhouetted against a square of swirling vapor.“Remember that I warned you!” he shouted back; and then the fog swallowed him.Howard was sitting and rubbing his eyes.“A malicious trick, that!” he was muttering. “To deliberately drug me! Had Iknown that glass of water.…”“How do you feel?” I asked as I shook him violently by the shoulders. “Do youthink you can walk?”“You drug me, and then ask me to walk! Frank, you’re as unreasonable as anartist. What is the matter now?”I pointed to the silent figure on the table. “Mulligan Wood is safer,” I said.“He belongs to them now!”Howard sprang to his feet and shook me by the arm.“What do you mean?” he cried. “How do you know?”“The doctor saw his brain,” I explained. “And he also saw something that hewould not—could not describe. But he told me that they would come for him, and Ibelieve him.”“We must leave here at once!” cried Howard. “Your doctor was right. We are indeadly danger. Even Mulligan Wood—but we need not return to the wood. There isyour launch!”“There is the launch!” I echoed, faint hope rising in my mind.“The fog will be a most deadly menace,” said Howard grimly. “But even death atsea is preferable to this horror.”It was not far from the house to the dock, and in less than a minute Howard wasseated in the stern of the launch and I was working furiously on the engine. Thefoghorns still moaned, but there were no lights visible anywhere in the harbor.We could not see two feet before our faces. The white wraiths of the fog weredimly visible in the darkness, but beyond them stretched endless night,lightless and full of terror.Howard was speaking. “Somehow I feel that there is death out there,” he said.“There is more death here,” I said as I started the engine. “I think I can avoidthe rocks. There is very little wind and I know the harbor.”“And of course we shall have the foghorns to guide us,” muttered Howard. “Ithink we had better make for the open sea.”I agreed.“The launch wouldn’t survive a storm,” I said, “but I’ve no desire to remain inthe harbor. If we reach the sea, we’ll probably be picked up by some ship. Itwould be sheer folly to remain where they can reach us.”“How do we know how far they can reach?” groaned Howard. “What are the distancesof Earth to things that have traveled through space? They will overrun Earth.They will destroy us all utterly.”“We’ll discuss that later,” I cried as the engine roared into life. “We’re goingto get as far away from them as possible. Perhaps they haven’t learned yet!While they’ve still limitations we may be able to escape.”We moved slowly into the channel, and the sound of the water splashing againstthe sides of the launch soothed us strangely. At a suggestion from me, Howardhad taken the wheel and was slowly bringing her about.“Keep her steady,” I shouted. “There isn’t any danger until we get into theNarrows!”For several minutes I crouched above the engine while Howard steered in silence.Then, suddenly, he turned to me with a gesture of elation.“I think the fog’s lifting,” he said.I stared into the darkness before me. Certainly it seemed less oppressive, andthe white spirals of mist that had been continually ascending through it werefading into insubstantial wisps. “Keep her head on,” I shouted. “We’re in luck.If the fog clears, we’ll be able to see the Narrows. Keep a sharp lookout forMulligan Light.”There is no describing the joy that filled us when we saw the light. Yellow andbright it streamed over the water and illuminated sharply the outlines of thegreat rocks that rose on both sides of the Narrows.“Let me have the wheel,” I shouted as I stepped quickly forward. “This is aticklish passage, but we’ll come through now with colors flying.”In our excitement and elation we almost forgot the horror that we had leftbehind us. I stood at the wheel and smiled confidently as we raced over the darkwater. Quickly the rocks drew nearer until their vast bulk towered above us.“We shall certainly make it!” I cried.But no response came from Howard. I heard him choke and gasp.“What is the matter?” I asked suddenly, and turning, saw that he was crouchingin terror above the engine. His back was turned toward me, but I knewinstinctively in which direction he was gazing.The dim shore that we had left shone like a flaming sunset. Mulligan Wood wasburning. Great flames shot up from the highest of the tall trees, and a thickcurtain of black smoke rolled slowly eastward, blotting out the few remaininglights in the harbor.But it was not the flames that caused me to cry out in fear and horror. It wasthe shape that towered above the trees, the vast, formless shape that movedslowly to and fro across the sky.God knows I tried to believe that I saw nothing. I tried to believe that theshape was a mere shadow cast by the flames, and I remember that I grippedHoward’s arm reassuringly.“The wood will be destroyed completely,” I cried, “and those ghastly things withus will be destroyed with it.”But when Howard turned and shook his head, I knew that the dim, formless thingthat towered above the trees was more than a shadow.“If we see it clearly, we are lost!” he warned, his voice vibrant with terror.“Pray that it remains without form!”It is older than the world, I thought, older than all religion. Before the dawnof civilization men knelt in adoration before it. It is present in allmythologies. It is the primal symbol. Perhaps, in the dim past, thousands andthousands of years ago, it was used to—repel the invaders. I shall fight theshape with a high and terrible mystery.Suddenly I became curiously calm. I knew that I had hardly a minute to act, thatmore than our lives were threatened, but I did not tremble. I reached calmlybeneath the engine and drew out a quantity of cotton waste.“Howard,” I said, “light a match. It is our only hope. You must strike a matchat once.”For what seemed eternities Howard stared at me uncomprehendingly. Then the nightwas clamorous with his laughter.“A match!” he shrieked. “A match to warm our little brains! Yes, we shall need amatch.”“Trust me!” I entreated. “You must—it is our one hope. Strike a match quickly.”“I do not understand!” Howard was sober now, but his voice quivered.“I have thought of something that may save us,” I said. “Please light this wastefor me.”Slowly he nodded. I had told him nothing, but I knew he guessed what I intendedto do. Often his insight was uncanny. With fumbling fingers he drew out a matchand struck it.“Be bold,” he said. “Show them that you are unafraid. Make the sign boldly.”As the waste caught fire, the form above the trees stood out with a frightfulclarity.I raised the flaming cotton and passed it quickly before my body in a straightline from my left to my right shoulder. Then I raised it to my forehead andlowered it to my knees.In an instant Howard had snatched the brand and was repeating the sign. He madetwo crosses, one against his body and one against the darkness with the torchheld at arm’s length.For a moment I shut my eyes, but I could still see the shape above the trees.Then slowly its form became less distinct, became vast and chaotic—and when Iopened my eyes it had vanished. I saw nothing but the flaming forest and theshadows cast by the tall trees.The horror had passed, but I did not move. I stood like an image of stonestaring over the black water. Then something seemed to burst in my head. Mybrain spun dizzily, and I tottered against the rail.I would have fallen, but Howard caught me about the shoulders. “We’re saved!” heshouted. “We’ve won through.”“I’m glad,” I said. But I was too utterly exhausted to really rejoice. My legsgave way beneath me and my head fell forward. All the sights and sounds of Earthwere swallowed up in a merciful blackness.IIHoward was writing when I entered the room.“How is the story going?” I asked.For a moment he ignored my question. Then he slowly turned and faced me. He washollow-eyed, and his pallor was alarming.“It’s not going well,” he said at last. “It doesn’t satisfy me. There areproblems that still elude me. I haven’t been able to capture all of the horrorof the thing in Mulligan Wood.”I sat down and lit a cigarette.“I want you to explain that horror to me,” I said. “For three weeks I havewaited for you to speak. I know that you have some knowledge which you areconcealing from me. What was the damp, spongy thing that landed on Wells’s headin the woods? Why did we hear a droning as we fled in the fog? What was themeaning of the shape that we saw above the trees? And why, in heaven’s name,didn’t the horror spread as we feared it might? What stopped it? Howard, what doyou think really happened to Wells’s brain? Did his body burn with the farm, ordid they—claim it? And the other body that was found in Mulligan Wood—that lean,blackened horror with riddled head—how do you explain that?” (Two days after thefire a skeleton had been found in Mulligan Wood. A few fragments of burnt fleshstill adhered to the bones, and the skullcap was missing.)It was a long time before Howard spoke again. He sat with bowed head fingeringhis notebook, and his body trembled all over. At last he raised his eyes. Theyshone with a wild light and his lips were ashen.“Yes,” he said. “We will discuss the horror together. Last week I did not wantto speak of it. It seemed too awful to put into words. But I shall never rest inpeace until I have woven it into a story, until I have made my readers feel andsee that dreadful, unspeakable thing. And I cannot write of it until I amconvinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that I understand it myself. It may helpme to talk about it.“You have asked me what the damp thing was that fell on Wells’s head. I believethat it was a human brain—the essence of a human brain drawn out through a hole,or holes, in a human head. I believe the brain was drawn out by imperceptibledegrees, and reconstructed again by the horror. I believe that for some purposeof its own it used human brains—perhaps to learn from them. Or perhaps it merelyplayed with them. The blackened, riddled body in Mulligan Wood? That was thebody of the first victim, some poor fool who got lost between the tall trees. Irather suspect the trees helped. I think the horror endowed them with a strangelife. Anyhow, the poor chap lost his brain. The horror took it, and played withit, and then accidentally dropped it. It dropped it on Wells’s head. Wells saidthat the long, thin, and very white arm he saw was looking for something that ithad dropped. Of course Wells didn’t really see the arm objectively, but thehorror that is without form or color had already entered his brain and clotheditself in human thought.“As for the droning that we heard and the shape we thought we saw above theburning forest—that was the horror seeking to make itself felt, seeking to breakdown barriers, seeking to enter our brains and clothe itself with our thoughts.It almost got us. If we had seen the white arm, we should have been lost.”Howard walked to the window. He drew back the curtains and gazed for a moment atthe crowded harbor and the tall, white buildings that towered against the moon.He was staring at the skyline of lower Manhattan. Sheer beneath him the cliffsof Brooklyn Heights loomed darkly.“Why didn’t they conquer?” he cried. “They could have destroyed us utterly. Theycould have wiped us from Earth—all our wealth and power would have gone downbefore them.”I shivered. “Yes … why didn’t the horror spread?” I asked.Howard shrugged his shoulders. “I do not know. Perhaps they discovered thathuman brains were too trivial and absurd to bother with. Perhaps we ceased toamuse them. Perhaps they grew tired of us. But it is conceivable that the signdestroyed them—or sent them back through space. I think they came millions ofyears ago, and were frightened away by the sign. When they discovered that wehad not forgotten the use of the sign they may have fled in terror. Certainlythere has been no manifestation for three weeks. I think that they are gone.”“And Henry Wells?” I asked.“Well, his body was not found. I imagine they came for him.”“And you honestly intend to put this—this obscenity into a story? Oh, my God!The whole thing is so incredible, so unheard of, that I can’t believe it. Did wenot dream it all? Were we ever really in Partridgeville? Did we sit in anancient house and discuss frightful things while the fog curled about us? Did wewalk through that unholy wood? Were the trees really alive, and did Henry Wellsrun about on his hands and knees like a wolf?”Howard sat down quietly and rolled up his sleeve. He thrust his thin arm towardme.“Can you argue away that scar?” he said. “There are the marks of the beast thatattacked me—the man-beast that was Henry Wells. A dream? I would cut off thisarm immediately at the elbow if you could convince me that it was a dream.”I walked to the window and remained for a long time staring at Manhattan. There,I thought, is something substantial. It is absurd to imagine that anything coulddestroy it. It is absurd to imagine that the horror was really as terrible as itseemed to us in Partridgeville. I must persuade Howard not to write about it. Wemust both try to forget it.I returned to where he sat and laid my hand on his shoulder.“You’ll never give up the idea of putting it into a story?” I urged gently.“Never!” He was on his feet, and his eyes were blazing. “Do you think I wouldgive up now when I’ve almost captured it? I shall write a story that willpenetrate to the inmost core of a horror that is without form and substance, butmore terrible than a plague-stricken city when the cadences of a tolling bellsound an end to all hope. I shall surpass Poe. I shall surpass all the masters.”“Surpass them and be damned then,” I said angrily. “That way madness lies, butit is useless to argue with you. Your egoism is too colossal.”I turned and walked swiftly out of the room. It occurred to me as I descendedthe stairs that I had made an idiot of myself with my fears, but even as I wentdown I looked fearfully back over my shoulder, as though I expected a greatstone weight to descend from above and crush me to the earth. He should forgetthe horror, I thought. He should wipe it from his mind. He will go mad if hewrites about it.Three days passed before I saw Howard again.“Come in,” he said in a curiously hoarse voice when I knocked on his door.I found him in dressing-gown and slippers, and I knew as soon as I saw him thathe was terribly exultant.“I have triumphed, Frank!” he cried. “I have reproduced the form that isformless, the burning shame that man has not looked upon, the crawling,fleshless obscenity that sucks at our brains!”Before I could so much as gasp, he placed the bulky manuscript in my hands.“Read it, Frank,” he commanded. “Sit down at once and read it!”I crossed to the window and sat down on the lounge. I sat there oblivious toeverything but the typewritten sheets before me. I confess that I was consumedwith curiosity. I had never questioned Howard’s power. With words he wroughtmiracles; breaths from the unknown blew always over his pages, and things thathad passed beyond Earth returned at his bidding. But could he even suggest thehorror that we had known? Could he even so much as hint at the loathsome,crawling thing that had claimed the brain of Henry Wells?I read the story through. I read it slowly, and clutched at the pillows besideme in a frenzy of loathing. As soon as I had finished it Howard snatched it fromme. He evidently suspected that I desired to tear it to shreds.“What do you think of it?” he cried exultantly.“It is indescribably foul!” I exclaimed. “It violates privacies of the mind thatshould never be laid bare.”“But you will concede that I have made the horror convincing?”I nodded and reached for my hat. “You have made it so convincing that I cannotremain and discuss it with you. I intend to walk until morning. I intend to walkuntil I am too weary to care, or think, or remember.”“It is a very great story!” he shouted at me, but I passed down the stairs andout of the house without replying.IIIIt was past midnight when the telephone rang. I laid down the book I was readingand lowered the receiver.“Hello. Who is there?” I asked.“Frank, this is Howard!” The voice was strangely high-pitched. “Come as quicklyas you can. They’ve come back! And Frank, the sign is powerless. I’ve tried thesign, but the droning is getting louder, and a dim shape.…” Howard’s voicetrailed off disastrously.I fairly screamed into the receiver. “Courage, man! Do not let them suspect thatyou are afraid. Make the sign again and again. I will come at once.”Howard’s voice came again, more hoarsely this time. “The shape is growingclearer and clearer. And there is nothing I can do! Frank, I have lost the powerto make the sign. I have forfeited all right to the protection of the sign. I’vebecome a priest of the Devil. That story—I should not have written that story.”“Show them that you are unafraid!” I cried.“I’ll try! I’ll try! Ah, my God! The shape is.…”I did not wait to hear more. Frantically seizing my hat and coat, I dashed downthe stairs and out into the street. As I reached the curb a dizziness seized me.I clung to a lamp-post to keep from falling, and waved my hand madly at afleeing taxi. Luckily the driver saw me. The car stopped, and I staggered outinto the street and climbed into it.“Quick!” I shouted. “Take me to 10 Brooklyn Heights!”“Yes, sir. Cold night, ain’t it?”“Cold!” I shouted. “It will be cold indeed when they get in. It will be coldindeed when they start to.…”The driver stared at me in amazement. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “We’llget you home all right, sir. Brooklyn Heights, did you say, sir?”“Brooklyn Heights,” I groaned, and collapsed against the cushions.As the car raced forward I tried not to think of the horror that awaited me. Iclutched desperately at straws. It is conceivable, I thought, that Howard hasgone temporarily insane. How could the horror have found him among so manymillions of people? It cannot be that they have deliberately sought him out. Itcannot be that they would deliberately choose him from among such multitudes. Heis too insignificant—all human beings are too insignificant. They would neverdeliberately angle for human beings. They would never deliberately trawl forhuman beings—but they did seek Henry Wells. And what did Howard say? “I havebecome a priest of the Devil.” Why not their priest? What if Howard has becometheir priest on Earth? What if his story has made him their priest?The thought was a nightmare to me, and I put it furiously from me. He will havecourage to resist them, I thought. He will show them that he is not afraid.“Here we are, sir. Shall I help you in, sir?”The car had stopped, and I groaned as I realized that I was about to enter whatmight prove to be my tomb. I descended to the sidewalk and handed the driver allthe change that I possessed. He stared at me in amazement.“You’ve given me too much,” he said. “Here, sir …”But I waved him aside and dashed up the stoop of the house before me. As Ifitted a key into the door I could hear him muttering: “Craziest drunk I everseen! He gives me four bucks to drive him ten blocks, and doesn’t want no thanksor nothin’.…”The lower hall was unlighted. I stood at the foot of the stairs and shouted.“I’m here, Howard! Can you come down?”There was no answer. I waited for perhaps ten seconds, but not a sound came fromthe room above.“I’m coming up!” I shouted in desperation, and started to climb the stairs. Iwas trembling all over. They’ve got him, I thought. I’m too late. Perhaps I hadbetter not—great God, what was that?I was unbelievably terrified. There was no mistaking the sounds. In the roomabove, someone was volubly pleading and crying aloud in agony. Was it Howard’svoice that I heard? I caught a few words indistinctly. “Crawling—ugh!Crawling—ugh! Oh, have pity! Cold and clee-ar. Crawling—ugh! God in heaven!”I had reached the landing, and when the pleadings rose to hoarse shrieks I fellto my knees, and made against my body, and upon the wall beside me, and in theair—the sign. I made the primal sign that had saved us in Mulligan Wood, butthis time I made it crudely, not with fire, but with fingers that trembled andcaught at my clothes, and I made it without courage or hope, made it darkly,with a conviction that nothing could save me.And then I got up quickly and went on up the stairs. My prayer was that theywould take me quickly, that my sufferings should be brief under the stars.The door of Howard’s room was ajar. By a tremendous effort I stretched out myhand and grasped the knob. Slowly I swung it inward.For a moment I saw nothing but the motionless form of Howard lying upon thefloor. He was lying upon his back. His knees were drawn up and he had raised hishand before his face, palms outward, as if to blot out a vision unspeakable.Upon entering the room I had deliberately, by lowering my eyes, narrowed myrange of vision. I saw only the floor and the lower section of the room. I didnot want to raise my eyes. I had lowered them in self-protection because Idreaded what the room held.I did not want to raise my eyes, but there were forces, powers at work in theroom, which I could not resist. I knew that if I looked up, the horror mightdestroy me, but I had no choice.Slowly, painfully, I raised my eyes and stared across the room. It would havebeen better, I think, if I had rushed forward immediately and surrendered to thething that towered there. The vision of that terrible, darkly shrouded shapewill come between me and the pleasures of the world as long as I remain in theworld.From the ceiling to the floor it towered, and it threw off blinding light. Andpierced by the shafts, whirling around and around, were the pages of Howard’sstory.In the center of the room, between the ceiling and the floor, the pages whirledabout, and the light burned through the sheets, and descending in spiralingshafts entered the brain of my poor friend. Into his head, the light was pouringin a continuous stream, and above, the Master of the light moved with a slowswaying of its entire bulk. I screamed and covered my eyes with my hands, butstill the Master moved—back and forth, back and forth. And still the lightpoured into the brain of my friend.And then there came from the mouth of the Master a most awful sound.… I hadforgotten the sign that I had made three times below in the darkness. I hadforgotten the high and terrible mystery before which all of the invaders werepowerless. But when I saw it forming itself in the room, forming itselfimmaculately, with a terrible integrity above the downstreaming light, I knewthat I was saved.I sobbed and fell upon my knees. The light dwindled, and the Master shriveledbefore my eyes.And then from the walls, from the ceiling, from the floor, there leapt flame—awhite and cleansing flame that consumed, that devoured and destroyed forever.But my friend was dead.*Originally published in Weird Tales, July 1928."},{"pageContent":"THE DWELLER IN DARKNESS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]AUGUST DERLETH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Searchers after horror haunt strange, far places. For them are the catacombs ofPtolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries. They climb to themoonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed stepsbeneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia.

P. LOVECRAFTIUntil recently, if a traveler in north central Wisconsin took the left fork atthe junction of the Brule River highway and the Chequamegon pike on the way toPashepaho, he would find himself in country so primitive that it would seemremote from all human contact. If he drove on along the little-used road, hemight in time pass a few tumble-down shacks where presumably people had oncelived and which have long ago been taken back by the encroaching forest; it isnot desolate country, but an area thick with growth, and over all its expansethere persists an intangible aura of the sinister, a kind of ominous oppressionof the spirit quickly manifest to even the most casual traveler, for the road hehas taken becomes ever more and more difficult to travel, and is eventually lostjust short of a deserted lodge built on the edge of a clear blue lake aroundwhich century-old trees brood eternally, a country where the only sounds are thecries of the owls, the whippoorwills, and the eerie loons at night, and thewind’s voice in the trees, and—but is it always the wind’s voice in the trees?And who can say whether the snapped twig is the sign of an animal passing—or ofsomething more, some other creature beyond man’s ken?For the forest surrounding the abandoned lodge at Rick’s Lake had a curiousreputation long before I myself knew it, a reputation which transcended similarstories about similar primeval places. There were odd rumors about somethingthat dwelt in the depths of the forest’s darkness—by no means the conventionalwild whisperings of ghosts—of something half-animal, half-man, fearsomely spokenof by such natives as inhabited the edges of that region, and referred to onlyby stubborn head-shakings among the Indians who occasionally came out of thatcountry and made their way south. The forest had an evil reputation; it wasnothing short of that; and already, before the turn of the century, it had ahistory that gave pause even to the most intrepid adventurer.The first record of it was left in the writings of a missionary on his waythrough that country to come to the aid of a tribe of Indians reported to thepost at Chequamegon Bay in the north to be starving. Fr. Piregard vanished, butthe Indians later brought in his effects: a sandal, his rosary, and a prayerbookin which he had written certain curious words which had been carefullypreserved: “I have the conviction that some creature is following me. I thoughtat first it was a bear, but I am now compelled to believe that it is somethingincredibly more monstrous than anything on this earth. Darkness is falling, andI believe I have developed a slight delirium, for I persist in hearing strangemusic and other curious sounds which can surely not derive from any naturalsource. There is also a disturbing illusion as of great footsteps which actuallyshake the earth, and I have several times encountered a very large footprintwhich varies in shape.…”The second record is far more sinister. When Big Bob Hiller, one of the mostrapacious lumber barons of the entire Midwest, began to encroach upon the Rick’sLake country in the middle of the last century, he could not fail to beimpressed by the stand of pine in the area near the lake, and, though he did notown it, he followed the usual custom of the lumber barons and sent his men infrom an adjoining piece he did own, under the intended explanation that he didnot know where his line ran. Thirteen men failed to return from that first day’swork on the edge of the forest area surrounding Rick’s Lake; two of their bodieswere never recovered; four were found—inconceivably—in the lake, several milesfrom where they had been cutting timber; the others were discovered at variousplaces in the forest. Hiller thought he had a lumber war on his hands, laid hismen off to mislead his unknown opponent, and then suddenly ordered them back towork in the forbidden region. After he had lost five more men, Hiller pulledout, and no hand since his time touched the forest, save for one or twoindividuals who took up land there and moved into the area.One and all, these individuals moved out within a short time, saying little, buthinting much. Yet, the nature of their whispered hints was such that they weresoon forced to abandon any explanation; so incredible were the tales they told,with overtones of something too horrible for description, of age-old evil whichpreceded anything dreamed of by even the most learned archaeologist. Only one ofthem vanished, and no trace of him was ever found. The others came back out ofthe forest and in the course of time were lost somewhere among other people inthe United States—all save a half-breed known as Old Peter, who was obsessedwith the idea that there were mineral deposits in the vicinity of the wood, andoccasionally went to camp on its edge, being careful not to venture in.It was inevitable that the Rick’s Lake legends would ultimately reach theattention of Professor Upton Gardner of the state university; he had completedcollections of Paul Bunyan, Whiskey Jack, and Hodag tales, and was engaged upona compilation of place legends when he first encountered the curioushalf-forgotten tales that emanated from the region of Rick’s Lake. I discoveredlater that his first reaction to them was one of casual interest; legends aboundin out-of-the-way places, and there was nothing to indicate that these were ofany more import than others. True, there was no similarity in the strictestsense of the word to the more familiar tales; for, while the usual legendsconcerned themselves with ghostly appearances of men and animals, lost treasure,tribal beliefs, and the like, those of Rick’s Lake were curiously unusual intheir insistence upon utterly outré creatures—or “a creature”—since no one hadever reported seeing more than one even vaguely in the forest’s darkness,half-man, half-beast, with always the hint that this description was inadequatein that it did injustice to the narrator’s concept of what it was that lurkedthere in the vicinity of the lake. Nevertheless, Professor Gardner would in allprobability have done little more than add the legends as he heard them to hiscollection, if it had not been for the reports—seemingly unconnected—of twocurious facts, and the accidental discovery of a third.The two facts were both newspaper accounts carried by Wisconsin papers within aweek of each other. The first was a terse, half-comic report headed: SEA SERPENTIN WISCONSIN LAKE? and read: “Pilot Joseph X. Castleton, on test flight overnorthern Wisconsin yesterday, reported seeing a large animal of some kindbathing by night in a forest lake in the vicinity of Chequamegon. Castleton wascaught in a thundershower and was flying low at the time, when, in an effort toascertain his whereabouts, he looked down when lightning flashed, and saw whatappeared to be a very large animal rising from the waters of a lake below him,and vanish into the forest. The pilot added no details to his story, but assertsthat the creature he saw was not the Loch Ness monster.” The second story wasthe utterly fantastic tale of the discovery of the body of Fr. Piregard,well-preserved, in the hollow trunk of a tree along the Brule River. At firstcalled a lost member of the Marquette-Jolliet Expedition, Fr. Piregard wasquickly identified. To this report was appended a frigid statement by thepresident of the State Historical Society dismissing the discovery as a hoax.The discovery Professor Gardner made was simply that an old friend was actuallythe owner of the abandoned lodge and most of the shore of Rick’s Lake.The sequence of events was thus clearly inevitable. Professor Gardner instantlyassociated both newspaper accounts with the Rick’s Lake legends; this might nothave been enough to stir him to drop his researches into the general mass oflegends abounding in Wisconsin for specific research of quite another kind, butthe occurrence of something even more astonishing sent him posthaste to theowner of the abandoned lodge for permission to take the place over in theinterests of science. What spurred him to take this action was nothing less thana request from the curator of the state museum to visit his office late onenight and view a new exhibit which had arrived. He went there in the company ofLaird Dorgan, and it was Laird who came to me.But that was after Professor Gardner vanished.For he did vanish; after sporadic reports from Rick’s Lake over a period ofthree months, all word from the lodge ceased entirely, and nothing further washeard of Professor Upton Gardner.Laird came to my room at the University Club late one night in October; hisfrank blue eyes were clouded, his lips tense, his brow furrowed, and there waseverything to show that he was in a state of moderate excitation which did notderive from liquor. I assumed that he was working too hard; the first-periodtests in his University of Wisconsin classes were just over; and Lairdhabitually took tests seriously—even as a student he had done so, and now as aninstructor, he was doubly conscientious.But it was not that. Professor Gardner had been missing almost a month now, andit was this which preyed on his mind. He said as much in so many words, adding,“Jack, I’ve got to go up there and see what I can do.”“Man, if the sheriff and the posse haven’t discovered anything, what can youdo?” I asked.“For one thing, I know more than they do.”“If so, why didn’t you tell them?”“Because it’s not the sort of thing they’d pay any attention to.”“Legends?”“No.”He was looking at me speculatively, as if wondering whether he could trust me. Iwas suddenly conscious of the conviction that he did know something which he, atleast, regarded with the gravest concern; and at the same time I had the mostcurious sensation of premonition and warning that I have ever experienced. Inthat instant the entire room seemed tense, the air electrified.“If I go up there—do you think you could go along?”“I guess I could manage.”“Good.” He took a turn or two about the room, his eyes brooding, looking at mefrom time to time, still betraying uncertainty and an inability to make up hismind.“Look, Laird—sit down and take it easy. That caged lion stuff isn’t good foryour nerves.”He took my advice; he sat down, covered his face with his hands, and shuddered.For a moment I was alarmed; but he snapped out of it in a few seconds, leanedback, and lit a cigarette.“You know those legends about Rick’s Lake, Jack?”I assured him that I knew them and the history of the place from thebeginning—as much as had been recorded.“And those stories in the papers I mentioned to you …?”The stories, too. I remembered them since Laird had discussed with me theireffect on his employer.“That second one, about Fr. Piregard,” he began, hesitated, stopped. But then,taking a deep breath, he began again. “You know, Gardner and I went over to thecurator’s office one night last spring.”“Yes, I was east at the time.”“Of course. Well, we went over there. The curator had something to show us. Whatdo you think it was?”“No idea. What was it?”“That body in the tree!”“No!”“Gave us quite a jolt. There it was, hollow trunk and all, just the way it hadbeen found. It had been shipped down to the museum for exhibition. But it wasnever exhibited, of course—for a very good reason. When Gardner saw it, hethought it was a waxwork. But it wasn’t.”“You don’t mean that it was the real thing?”Laird nodded. “I know it’s incredible.”“It’s just not possible.”“Well, yes, I suppose it’s impossible. But it was so. That’s why it wasn’texhibited—just taken out and buried.”“I don’t quite follow that.”He leaned forward and said very earnestly, “Because when it came in it had allthe appearance of being completely preserved, as if by some natural embalmingprocess. It wasn’t. It was frozen. It began to thaw out that night. And therewere certain things about it that indicated that Fr. Piregard hadn’t been deadthe three centuries history said he had. The body began to go to pieces in adozen ways—but not crumbling into dust, nothing like that. Gardner estimatedthat he hadn’t been dead over five years. Where had he been in the meantime?”He was quite sincere. I would not at first have believed it. But there was acertain disquieting earnestness about Laird that forbade any levity on my part.If I had treated his story as a joke, as I had the impulse to do, he would haveshut up like a clam, and walked out of my room to brood about this thing insecret, with Lord knows what harm to himself. For a little while I saidabsolutely nothing.“You don’t believe it.”“I haven’t said so.”“I can feel it.”“No. It’s hard to take. Let’s say I believe in your sincerity.”“That’s fair enough,” he said grimly. “Do you believe in me sufficiently to goalong up to the lodge and find out what may have happened there?”“Yes, I do.”“But I think you’d better read these excerpts from Gardner’s letters first.” Heput them down on my desk like a challenge. He had copied them off onto a singlesheet of paper, and as I took this up he went on, talking rapidly, explainingthat the letters had been those written by Gardner from the lodge. When hefinished, I turned to the excerpts and read.I cannot deny that there is about the lodge, the lake, even the forest an auraof evil, of impending danger—it is more than that, Laird, if I could explain it,but archaeology is my forte, and not fiction. For it would take fiction, Ithink, to do justice to this thing I feel.… Yes, there are times when I have thedistinct feeling that someone or something is watching me out of the forest orfrom the lake—there does not seem to be a distinction as I would like tounderstand it, and while it does not make me uneasy, nevertheless it is enoughto give me pause. I managed the other day to make contact with Old Peter, thehalf-breed. He was at the moment a little the worse for firewater, but when Imentioned the lodge and the forest to him, he drew into himself like a clam. Buthe did put words to it: he called it the Wendigo—you are familiar with thislegend, which properly belongs to the French-Canadian country.That was the first letter, written about a week after Gardner had reached theabandoned lodge on Rick’s Lake. The second was extremely terse, and had beensent by special delivery.Will you wire Miskatonic University at Arkham, Massachusetts, to ascertain ifthere is available for study a photostatic copy of a book known as theNecronomicon, by an Arabian writer who signs himself Abdul Alhazred? Makeinquiry also for the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Book of Eibon, and determinewhether it is possible to purchase through one of the local bookstores a copy ofThe Outsider and Others, by H. P. Lovecraft, published by Arkham House lastyear. I believe that these books individually and collectively may be helpful indetermining just what it is that haunts this place. For there is something; makeno mistake about that; I am convinced of it, and when I tell you that I believeit has lived here not for years, but for centuries—perhaps even before the timeof man—you will understand that I may be on the threshold of great discoveries.Startling as this letter was, the third was even more so. For an interval of afortnight went by between the second and third letters, and it was apparent thatsomething had happened to threaten Professor Gardner’s composure, for his thirdletter was even in this selected excerpt marked by extreme perturbation.Everything evil here.… I don’t know whether it is the Black Goat with a ThousandYoung or the Faceless One and/or something more that rides the wind. For God’ssake … those accursed fragments!… Something in the lake, too, and at night thesounds! How still, and then suddenly those horrible flutes, those wateryululations! Not a bird, not an animal then—only those ghastly sounds. And thevoices!… Or is it but a dream? Is it my own voice I hear in the darkness?…I found myself increasingly shaken as I read those excerpts. Certainimplications and hints lodged between the lines of what Professor Gardner hadwritten were suggestive of terrible, ageless evil, and I felt that there wasopening up before Laird Dorgan and myself an adventure so incredible, sobizarre, and so unbelievably dangerous that we might well not return to tell it.Yet even then there was a lurking doubt in my mind that we would say anythingabout what we found at Rick’s Lake.“What do you say?” asked Laird impatiently.“I’m going.”“Good! Everything’s ready. I’ve even got a dictaphone and batteries enough torun it. I’ve arranged for the sheriff of the county at Pashepaho to replaceGardner’s notes, and leave everything just the way it was.”“A dictaphone,” I broke in. “What for?”“Those sounds he wrote about—we can settle that for once and all. If they’rethere to be heard, the dictaphone will record them; if they’re just imagination,it won’t.” He paused, his eyes very grave. “You know, Jack, we may not come outof this thing.”“I know.”I did not say so, because I knew that Laird, too, felt the same way I did: thatwe were going like two dwarfed Davids to face an adversary greater than anyGoliath, an adversary invisible and unknown, who bore no name and was shroudedin legend and fear, a dweller not only of the darkness of the wood but in thatgreater darkness which the mind of man has sought to explore since his dawn.IISheriff Cowan was at the lodge when we arrived. Old Peter was with him. Thesheriff was a tall, saturnine individual clearly of Yankee stock; thoughrepresenting the fourth generation of his family in the area, he spoke with atwang which doubtless had persisted from generation to generation. Thehalf-breed was a dark-skinned, ill-kempt fellow; he had a way of saying little,and from time to time grinned or snickered as at some secret joke.“I brung up express that come some time past for the professor,” said thesheriff. “From some place in Massachusetts was one of ’em, and the other fromdown near Madison. Didn’t seem t’ me ’twas worth sendin’ back. So I took andbrung ’em with the keys. Don’t know that you fellers ’ll git anyw’eres. My posseand me went through the hull woods, didn’t see a thing.”“You ain’t tellin’ ’em everything,” put in the half-breed, grinning.“Ain’t no more to tell.”“What about the carvin’?”The sheriff shrugged irritably. “Damn it, Peter, that ain’t got nothin’ to dowith the professor’s disappearance.”“He made a drawin’ of it, didn’t he?”So pressed, the sheriff confided that two members of his posse had stumbled upona great slab or rock in the center of the wood; it was mossy and overgrown, butthere was upon it an odd drawing, plainly as old as the forest—probably the workof one of the primitive Indian tribes once known to inhabit northern Wisconsinbefore the Dacotah Sioux and the Winnebago—Old Peter grunted with contempt. “No Indian drawing.”The sheriff shook this off and went on. The drawing represented some kind ofcreature, but no one could tell what it was; it was certainly not a man, but onthe other hand, it did not seem to be hairy, like a beast. Moreover, the unknownartist had forgotten to put in a face.“ ’N beside it there wuz two things,” said the half-breed.“Don’t pay no attention to him,” said the sheriff then.“What two things?” demanded Laird.“Jest things,” replied the half-breed, snickering. “Heh, heh! Ain’t no other wayto tell it—warn’t human, warn’t animal, jest things.”Cowan was irritated. He became suddenly brusque; he ordered the half-breed tokeep still, and went on to say that if we needed him, he would be at his officein Pashepaho. He did not explain how we were to make contact with him, sincethere was no telephone at the lodge, but plainly he had no high regard for thelegends abounding about the area into which we had ventured with suchdetermination. The half-breed regarded us with an almost stolid indifference,broken only by his sly grin from time to time, and his dark eyes examined ourluggage with keen speculation and interest. Laird met his gaze occasionally, andeach time Old Peter indolently shifted his eyes. The sheriff went on talking;the notes and drawings the missing man had made were on the desk he had used inthe big room which made up almost the entire ground floor of the lodge, justwhere he had found them; they were the property of the State of Wisconsin andwere to be returned to the sheriff’s office when we had finished with them. Atthe threshold he turned for a parting shot to say he hoped we would not bestaying too long, because “While I ain’t givin’ in to any of them crazy ideas—itjest ain’t been so healthy for some of the people who came here.”“The half-breed knows or suspects something,” said Laird at once. “We’ll have toget in touch with him sometime when the sheriff’s not around.”“Didn’t Gardner write that he was pretty close-mouthed when it came to concretedata?”“Yes, but he indicated the way out. Firewater.”We went to work and settled ourselves, storing our food supplies, setting up thedictaphone, getting things into readiness for a stay of at least a fortnight;our supplies were sufficient for this length of time, and if we had to remainlonger, we could always go into Pashepaho for more food. Moreover, Laird hadbrought fully two dozen dictaphone cylinders, so that we had plenty of them foran indefinite time, particularly since we did not intend to use them except whenwe slept—and this would not be often, for we had agreed that one of us wouldwatch while the other took his rest, an arrangement we were not sanguine enoughto believe would hold good without fail, hence the machine. It was not untilafter we had settled our belongings that we turned to the things the sheriff hadbrought, and meanwhile, we had ample opportunity to become aware of the verydefinite aura of the place.For it was not imagination that there was a strange aura about the lodge and thegrounds. It was not alone the brooding, almost sinister stillness, not alone thetall pines encroaching upon the lodge, not alone the blue-black waters of thelake, but something more than that: a hushed, almost menacing air of waiting, akind of aloof assurance that was ominous—as one might imagine a hawk might feelleisurely cruising above prey it knows will not escape its talons. Nor was thisa fleeting impression, for it was obvious almost at once, and it grew with suresteadiness throughout the hour or so that we worked there; moreover, it was soplainly to be felt, that Laird commented upon it as if he had long ago acceptedit, and knew that I, too, had done so! Yet there was nothing primary to whichthis could be attributed. There are thousands of lakes like Rick’s in northernWisconsin and Minnesota, and while many of them are not in forest areas, thosewhich are do not differ greatly in their physical aspects from Rick’s; so therewas nothing in the appearance of the place which at all contributed to thebrooding sense of horror which seemed to invade us from outside. Indeed, thesetting was rather the opposite; under the afternoon sunlight, the old lodge,the lake, the high forest all around, had a pleasant air of seclusion—an airwhich made the contrast with the intangible aura of evil all the more pointedand fearsome. The fragrance of the pines, together with the freshness of thewater, served also to emphasize the intangible mood of menace.We turned at last to the material left on Professor Gardner’s desk. The expresspackages contained, as expected, a copy of The Outsider and Others, by H. P.Lovecraft, shipped by the publishers, and photostatic copies of manuscript andprinted pages taken from the R’lyeh Text and Ludvig Prinn’s De VermisMysteriis—apparently sent for to supplement the earlier data dispatched to theprofessor by the librarian of Miskatonic University, for we found among thematerial brought back by the sheriff certain pages from the Necronomicon, in thetranslation by Olaus Wormius, and likewise from the Pnakotic Manuscripts. But itwas not these pages, which for the most part were unintelligible to us, whichheld our attention. It was the fragmentary notes left by Professor Gardner.It was quite evident that he had not had time to do more than put down suchquestions and thoughts as had occurred to him, and, while there was littleassimilation manifest, yet there was about what he had written a certainterrible suggestiveness which grew to colossal proportions as everything he hadnot put down became obvious.“Is the slab (a) only an ancient ruin, (b) a marker similar to a tomb, (c) or afocal point for Him? If the latter, from outside? Or from beneath? (NB: Nothingto show that the thing has been disturbed.)“Cthulhu or Kthulhut. In Rick’s Lake? Subterrene passage to Superior and the seavia the St. Lawrence? (NB: Except for the aviator’s story, nothing to show thatthe Thing has anything to do with the water. Probably not one of the waterbeings.)“Hastur. But manifestations do not seem to have been of air beings either.“Yog-Sothoth. Of earth certainly—but he is not the ‘Dweller in Darkness.’ (NB:The Thing, whatever it is, must be of the earth deities, even though it travelsin time and space. It could possibly be more than one, of which only the earthbeing is occasionally visible. Ithaqua, perhaps?)“ ‘Dweller in Darkness.’ Could He be the same as the Blind, Faceless One? Hecould be truly said to be dwelling in darkness. Nyarlathotep? Or Shub-Niggurath?“What of fire? There must be a deity here, too. But no mention. (NB: Presumably,if the Earth and Water Beings oppose those of Air, then they must oppose thoseof Fire as well. Yet there is evidence here and there to show that there is moreconstant struggle between Air and Water Beings than between those of Earth andAir. Abdul Alhazred is damnably obscure in places. There is no clue as to theidentity of Cthugha in that terrible footnote.)“Partier says I am on the wrong track. I’m not convinced. Whoever it is thatplays the music in the night is a master of hellish cadence and rhythm. And,yes, of cacophony. (CF. Bierce and Chambers.)”That was all.“What incredible gibberish!” I exclaimed.And yet—and yet I knew instinctively it was not gibberish. Strange things hadhappened here, things which demanded an explanation which was not terrestrial;and here, in Gardner’s handwriting, was evidence to show that he had not onlyarrived at the same conclusion, but passed it. However it might sound, Gardnerhad written it in all seriousness, and clearly for his own use alone, since onlythe vaguest and most suggestive outline seemed apparent. Moreover, the notes hada startling effect on Laird; he had gone quite pale, and now stood looking downas if he could not believe what he had seen.“What is it?” I asked.“Jack—he was in contact with Partier.”“It doesn’t register,” I answered, but even as I spoke I remembered thehush-hush that had attended the severing of old Professor Partier’s connectionwith the University of Wisconsin. It had been given out to the press that theold man had been somewhat too liberal in his lectures in anthropology—that is,he had “Communistic leanings!”—which everyone who knew Partier realized was farfrom the facts. But he had said strange things in his lectures, he had talked ofhorrible, forbidden matters, and it had been thought best to let him outquietly. Unfortunately, Partier went out trumpeting in his contemptuous manner,and it had been difficult to hush the matter up satisfactorily.“He’s living down in Wausau now,” said Laird.“Do you suppose he could translate all this?” I asked and knew that I had echoedthe thought in Laird’s mind.“He’s three hours away by car. We’ll copy these notes, and if nothing happens—ifwe can’t discover anything, we’ll go to see him.”If nothing happened—!If the lodge by day had seemed brooding in an air of ominousness, by night itseemed surcharged with menace. Moreover, events began to take place withdisarming and insidious suddenness, beginning in mid-evening, when Laird and Iwere sitting over those curious photostats sent out by Miskatonic University inlieu of the books and manuscripts themselves, which were far too valuable topermit out of their haven. The first manifestation was so simple that for sometime neither of us noticed its strangeness. It was simply the sound in the treesas of rising wind, the growing song among the pines. The night was warm, and allthe windows of the lodge stood open. Laird commented on the wind, and went ongiving voice to his perplexity regarding the fragments before us. Not until halfan hour had gone by and the sound of the wind had risen to the proportions of agale did it occur to Laird that something was wrong, and he looked up, his eyesgoing from one open window to another in growing apprehension. Then I, too,became aware.Despite the tumult of the wind, no draft of air had circulated in the room, notone of the light curtains at the window was so much as trembling!With one simultaneous movement, both of us stepped out upon the broad verandahof the lodge.There was no wind, no breath of air stirring to touch our hands and faces. Therewas only the sound in the forest. And both of us looked up to where the pineswere silhouetted against the starswept heavens, expecting their tops would bebending before a high gale; but there was no movement whatever; the pines stoodstill, motionless; and the sound as of wind continued all around us. We stood onthe verandah for half an hour, vainly attempting to determine the source of thesound—and then, as unobtrusively as it had begun, it stopped!The hour was now approaching midnight, and Laird prepared for bed; he had sleptlittle the previous night, and we had agreed that I was to take the first watchuntil four in the morning. Neither of us said much about the sound in the pines,but what was said indicated a desire to believe that there was a naturalexplanation for the phenomenon, if we could establish a point of contact forunderstanding. It was inevitable, I suppose, that even in the face of all thecurious facts which had come to our attention, there should still be an earnestwish to find a natural explanation. Certainly the oldest fear and the greatestfear to which man is prey is fear of the unknown; anything capable ofrationalization and explanation cannot be feared; but it was growing hourly morepatent that we were facing something which defied all known rationales andcredos, but hinged upon a system of belief that antedated even primitive man,and indeed, as scattered hints within the photostat pages from MiskatonicUniversity suggested, antedated even earth itself. And there was always thatbrooding terror, the ominous suggestion of menace from something far beyond thegrasp of such a puny intelligence as man’s.Thus it was with some trepidation that I prepared for my vigil. After Laird hadgone to his room, which was at the head of the stairs, with a door opening upona railed-in balcony looking down into the lodge room where I sat with the bookby Lovecraft, reading here and there in its pages, I settled down to a kind ofapprehensive waiting. It was not that I was afraid of what might take place, butrather that I was afraid that what took place might be beyond my understanding.However, as the minutes ticked past, I became engrossed in The Outsider andOthers, with its hellish suggestions of eon-old evil, of entities coexistentwith all time and conterminous with all space, and began to understand, howevervaguely, a relation between the writings of this fantasist and the curious notesProfessor Gardner had made. The most disturbing factor in this cognizance wasthe knowledge that Professor Gardner had made his notes independent of the bookI now read, since it had arrived after his disappearance. Moreover, though therewere certain keys to what Gardner had written in the first material he hadreceived from Miskatonic University, there was growing now a mass of evidence toindicate that the professor had had access to some other source of information.What was that source? Could he have learned something from Old Peter? Hardlylikely. Could he have gone to Partier? It was not impossible that he had doneso, though he had not imparted this information to Laird. Yet it was not to beruled out that he had made contact with still another source of which there wasno hint among his notes.It was while I was engaged in this engrossing speculation that I becameconscious of the music. It may actually have been sounding for some time beforeI heard it, but I do not think so. It was a curious melody that was beingplayed, beginning as something lulling and harmonious, and then subtly becomingcacophonous and demoniac, rising in tempo, though all the time coming as from agreat distance. I listened to it with growing astonishment; I was not at firstaware of the sense of evil which fell upon me the moment I stepped outside andbecame cognizant that the music emanated from the depths of the dark forest.There, too, I was sharply conscious of its weirdness; the melody was unearthly,utterly bizarre and foreign, and the instruments which were being used seemed tobe flutes, or certainly some variation of flutes.Up to that moment there was no really alarming manifestation. That is, there wasnothing but the suggestiveness of the two events which had taken place toinspire fear. There was, in short, always a good possibility that there might bea natural explanation about the sound as of wind and that of music.But now, suddenly, there occurred something so utterly horrible, something sofraught with terror, that I was at once made prey to the most terrible fearknown to man, a surging primitive horror of the unknown, of something fromoutside—for if I had had doubts about the things suggested by Gardner’s notesand the material accompanying them, I knew instinctively that they wereunfounded, for the sound that succeeded the strains of that unearthly music wasof such a nature that it defied description, and defies it even now. It wassimply a ghastly ululation, made by no beast known to man, and certainly by noman. It rose to an awful crescendo and fell away into a silence that was themore terrible for this soul-searing crying. It began with a two-note call, twicerepeated, a frightful sound: “Ygnaiih! Ygnaiih!” and then became a triumphantwailing cry that ululated out of the forest and into the dark night like thehideous voice of the pit itself:“Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaaahaaahaaahuaa-ah-ah-ah-ngh’aaaa-ngh’aaa-ya-ya-ya …”I stood for a minute absolutely frozen to the verandah. I could not have uttereda sound if it had been necessary to save my life. The voice had ceased, but thetrees still seemed to echo its frightful syllables. I heard Laird tumble fromhis bed, I heard him running down the stairs calling my name, but I could notanswer. He came out on the verandah and caught hold of my arm.“Good God! What was that?”“Did you hear it?”“I heard enough.”We stood waiting for it to sound again, but there was no repetition of it. Norwas there a repetition of the music. We returned to the sitting room and waitedthere, neither of us able to sleep.But there was not another manifestation of any kind throughout the remainder ofthat night!IIIThe occurrences of that first night more than anything else decided ourdirection on the following day. For, realizing that we were too ill-informed tocope with any understanding with what was taking place, Laird set the dictaphonefor that second night, and we started out for Wausau and Professor Partier,planning to return on the following day. With forethought, Laird carried withhim our copy of the notes Gardner had left, skeletal as they were.Professor Partier, at first reluctant to see us, admitted us finally to hisstudy in the heart of the Wisconsin city, and cleared books and papers from twochairs so that we could sit down. Though he had the appearance of an old man,wore a long white beard, and a fringe of white hair straggled from under hisblack skullcap, he was as agile as a young man; he was thin, his fingers werebony, his face gaunt, with deep black eyes, and his features were set in anexpression that was one of profound cynicism, disdainful, almost contemptuous,and he made no effort to make us comfortable, beyond providing places for us tosit. He recognized Laird as Professor Gardner’s secretary, said brusquely thathe was a busy man preparing what would doubtless be his last book for hispublishers, and he would be obliged to us if we would state the object of ourvisit as concisely as possible.“What do you know of Cthulhu?” asked Laird bluntly.The professor’s reaction was astonishing. From an old man whose entire attitudehad been one of superiority and aloof disdain, he became instantly wary andalert; with exaggerated care he put down the pencil he had been holding, hiseyes never once left Laird’s face, and he leaned forward a little over his desk.“So,” he said, “you come to me.” He laughed then, a laugh which was like thecackling of some centenarian. “You come to me to ask about Cthulhu. Why?”Laird explained curtly that we were bent upon discovering what had happened toProfessor Gardner. He told as much as he thought necessary, while the old manclosed his eyes, picked up his pencil once more, and tapping gently with it,listened with marked care, prompting Laird from time to time. When he hadfinished, Professor Partier opened his eyes slowly and looked from one to theother of us with an expression that was not unlike one of pity mixed with pain.“So he mentioned me, did he? But I had no contact with him other than onetelephone call.” He pursed his lips. “He had more reference to an earliercontroversy than to his discoveries at Rick’s Lake. I would like now to give youa little advice.”“That’s what we came for.”“Go away from that place, and forget all about it.”Laird shook his head in determination.Partier estimated him, his dark eyes challenging his decision; but Laird did notfalter. He had embarked upon this venture, and he meant to see it through.“These are not forces with which common men have been accustomed to deal,” saidthe old man then. “We are frankly not equipped to do so.” He began then, withoutother preamble, to talk of matters so far removed from the mundane as to bealmost beyond conception. Indeed, it was some time before I began to comprehendwhat he was hinting at, for his concept was so broad and breathtaking that itwas difficult for anyone accustomed to so prosaic an existence as mine to grasp.Perhaps it was because Partier began obliquely by suggesting that it was notCthulhu or his minions who haunted Rick’s Lake, but clearly another; theexistence of the slab and what was carved upon it clearly indicated the natureof the being who dwelled there from time to time. Professor Gardner had in finalanalysis got on to the right path, despite thinking that Partier did not believeit. Who was the Blind, Faceless One but Nyarlathotep? Certainly notShub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of a Thousand Young.Here Laird interrupted him to press for something more understandable, and thenat last, realizing that we knew nothing, the professor went on, still in thatvaguely irritable oblique manner, to expound mythology—a mythology of pre-humanlife not only on the earth, but on the stars of all the universe. “We knownothing,” he repeated from time to time. “We know nothing at all. But there arecertain signs, certain shunned places. Rick’s Lake is one of them.” He spoke ofbeings whose very names were awesome—of the Elder Gods who live on Betelgeuse,remote in time and space, who had cast out into space the Great Old Ones, led byAzathoth and Yog-Sothoth, and numbering among them the primal spawn of theamphibious Cthulhu, the bat-like followers of Hastur the Unspeakable, ofLloigor, Zhar, and Ithaqua, who walked the winds and interstellar space, theearth beings, Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath—the evil beings who sought alwaysto triumph once more over the Elder Gods, who had shut them out or imprisonedthem—as Cthulhu long ago slept in the ocean realm of R’lyeh, as Hastur wasimprisoned upon a black star near Aldebaran in the Hyades. Long before humanbeings walked the earth, the conflict between the Elder Gods and the Great OldOnes had taken place; and from time to time the Old Ones had made a resurgencetoward power, sometimes to be stopped by direct interference by the Elder Gods,but more often by the agency of human or non-human beings serving to bring abouta conflict among the beings of the elements, for, as Gardner’s notes indicated,the evil Old Ones were elemental forces. And every time there had been aresurgence, the mark of it had been left deep upon man’s memory—though everyattempt was made to eliminate the evidence and quiet survivors.“What happened at Innsmouth, Massachusetts, for instance?” he asked tensely.“What took place at Dunwich? In the wilds of Vermont? At the old Tuttle house onthe Aylesbury pike? What of the mysterious cult of Cthulhu, and the utterlystrange voyage of exploration to the Mountains of Madness? What beings dwelt onthe hidden and shunned Plateau of Leng? And what of Kadath in the Cold Waste?Lovecraft knew! Gardner and many another have sought to discover those secrets,to link the incredible happenings which have taken place here and there on theface of the planet—but it is not desired by the Old Ones that mere man shallknow too much. Be warned!”He took up Gardner’s notes without giving either of us a chance to say anything,and studied them, putting on a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles which made himlook more ancient than ever, and going on talking, more to himself than to us,saying that it was held that the Old Ones had achieved a higher degree ofdevelopment in some aspects of science than was hitherto believed possible, butthat, of course, nothing was known. The way in which he consistently emphasizedthis indicated very clearly that only a fool or an idiot would disbelieve, proofor no proof. But in the next sentence, he admitted that there was certainproof—the revolting and bestial plaque bearing a representation of a hellishmonstrosity walking on the winds above the earth found in the hand of JosiahAlwyn when his body was discovered on a small Pacific island months after hisincredible disappearance from his home in Wisconsin; the drawings made byProfessor Gardner—and, even more than anything else, that curious slab of carvenstones in the forest at Rick’s Lake.“Cthugha,” he murmured then, wonderingly. “I’ve not read the footnote to whichhe makes reference. And there’s nothing in Lovecraft.” He shook his head. “No, Idon’t know.” He looked up. “Can you frighten something out of the half-breed?”“We’ve thought of that,” admitted Laird.“Well, now, I advise a try. It seems evident that he knows something—it may benothing but an exaggeration to which his more or less primitive mind has lentitself; but on the other hand—who can say?”More than this Professor Partier could not or would not tell us. Moreover, Lairdwas reluctant to ask, for there was obviously a damnably disturbing connectionbetween what he had revealed, however incredible it might be, and what ProfessorGardner had written.Our visit, however, despite its inconclusiveness—or perhaps because of it—had acurious effect on us. The very indefiniteness of the professor’s summary andcomments, coupled with such fragmentary and disjointed evidence which had cometo us independently of Partier, sobered us and increased Laird’s determinationto get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding Gardner’s disappearance, amystery which had now become enlarged to encompass the greater mystery of Rick’sLake and the forest around it.On the following day we returned to Pashepaho, and as luck would have it, wepassed Old Peter on the road leading from town. Laird slowed down, backed up,and leaned out to meet the old fellow’s speculative gaze.“Lift?”“Reckon so.”Old Peter got in and sat on the edge of the seat until Laird unceremoniouslyproduced a flask and offered it to him. Then his eyes lit up; he took it eagerlyand drank deeply, while Laird made small talk about life in the north woods andencouraged the half-breed to talk about the mineral deposits he thought he couldfind in the vicinity of Rick’s Lake. In this way some distance was covered, andduring this time, the half-breed retained the flask, handing it back at lastwhen it was almost empty. He was not intoxicated in the strictest sense of theword, but he was uninhibited, and he made no protest when we took the lake roadwithout stopping to let him out, though when he saw the lodge and knew where hewas, he said thickly that he was off his route and had to be getting back beforedark.He would have started back immediately, but Laird persuaded him to come in withthe promise that he would mix him a drink.He did. He mixed him as stiff a drink as he could, and Peter downed it.Not until he had begun to feel its effects did Laird turn to the subject of whatPeter knew about the mystery of the Rick’s Lake country, and instantly then thehalf-breed became close-mouthed, mumbling that he would say nothing, he had seennothing, it was all a mistake, his eyes shifting from one to the other of us.But Laird persisted. He had seen the slab of carven stone, hadn’t he?Yes—reluctantly. Would he take us to it? Peter shook his head violently. Notnow. It was nearly dark, it might be dark before they could return.But Laird was adamant, and finally the half-breed, convinced by Laird’sinsistence that they could return to the lodge and even to Pashepaho, if Peterliked, before darkness fell, consented to lead us to the slab. Then, despite hisunsteadiness, he set off swiftly into the woods along a lane that could hardlybe called a trail, so faint it was, and loped along steadily for almost a milebefore he drew up short and, standing behind a tree, as if he were afraid ofbeing seen, pointed shakily to a little open spot surrounded by high trees atenough of a distance that ample sky was visible overhead.“There—that’s it.”The slab was only partly visible, for moss had grown over much of it. Laird,however, was at the moment only secondarily interested in it; it was manifestthat the half-breed stood in mortal terror of the spot and wished only toescape.“How would you like to spend the night here, Peter?” asked Laird.The half-breed shot a frightened glance at him. “Me? Gawd, no!”Suddenly Laird’s voice steeled. “Unless you tell us what it was you saw here,that’s what you’re going to do.”The half-breed was not so much the worse for liquor that he could not foreseeevents—the possibility that Laird and I might overcome him and tie him to a treeat the edge of this open space. Plainly, he considered a bolt for it, but heknew that in his condition, he could not outrun us.“Don’t make me tell,” he said. “It ain’t supposed to be told. I ain’t never toldno one—not even the professor.”“We want to know, Peter,” said Laird with no less menace.The half-breed began to shake; he turned and looked at the slab as if he thoughtat any moment an inimical being might rise from it and advance upon him withlethal intent. “I can’t, I can’t,” he muttered, and then, forcing his bloodshoteyes to meet Laird’s once more, he said in a low voice, “I don’t know what itwas. Gawd! it was awful. It was a Thing—didn’t have no face, hollered there tillI thought my eardrums ‘d bust, and them things that was with it—Gawd!” Heshuddered and backed away from the tree, toward us. “Honest t’ Gawd, I seen itthere one night. It jist come, seems like, out of the air and there it wasa-singin’ and a-wailin’ and them things playin’ that damn music. I guess I wascrazy for a while afore I got away.” His voice broke, his vivid memoryre-created what he had seen; he turned, shouting harshly, “Let’s git outa here!”and ran back the way we had come, weaving among the trees.Laird and I ran after him, catching up easily, Laird reassuring him that wewould take him out of the woods in the car, and he would be well away from theforest’s edge before darkness overtook him. He was as convinced as I that therewas nothing imagined about the half-breed’s account, that he had indeed told usall he knew; and he was silent all the way back from the highway to which wetook Old Peter, pressing five dollars upon him so that he could forget what hehad seen in liquor if he were so inclined.“What do you think?” asked Laird when we reached the lodge once more.I shook my head.“That wailing night before last,” said Laird. “The sounds Professor Gardnerheard—and now this. It ties up—damnably, horribly.” He turned on me with intenseand fixed urgence. “Jack, are you game to visit that slab tonight?”“Certainly.”“We’ll do it.”It was not until we were inside the lodge that we thought of the dictaphone, andthen Laird prepared at once to play whatever had been recorded back to us. Hereat least, he reflected, was nothing dependent in any way upon anyone’simagination; here was the product of the machine, pure and simple, and everyoneof intelligence knew full well that machines were far more dependable than men,having neither nerves nor imagination, knowing neither fear nor hope. I thinkthat at most we counted upon hearing a repetition of the sounds of the previousnight; not in our wildest dreams did we look forward to what we did actuallyhear, for the record mounted from the prosaic to the incredible, from theincredible to the horrible, and at last to a cataclysmic revelation that left uscompletely cut away from every credo of normal existence.It began with the occasional singing of loons and owls, followed by a period ofsilence. Then there was once more that familiar rushing sound, as of wind in thetrees, and this was followed by the curious cacophonous piping of flutes. Thenthere was recorded a series of sounds, which I put down here exactly as we heardthem in that unforgettable evening hour:Ygnaiih! Ygnaiih!EEE-ya-ya-ya-yahaaahaaahaaa-ah-ah-ah-ngh’aaa-ngh’aaa-ya-ya-yaaa! (In a voicethat was neither human nor bestial, but yet of both.)(An increased tempo in the music, becoming more wild and demoniac.)Mighty Messenger—Nyarlathotep … from the world of Seven Suns to his earth place,the Wood of N’gai, whither may come Him Who Is Not to Be Named.… There shall beabundance of those from the Black Goat of the Woods, the Goat with the ThousandYoung.… (In a voice that was curiously human.)(A succession of odd sounds, as if audience-response: a buzzing and humming, asof telegraph wires.)Iä! Iä! Shub-Niggurath! Ygnaiih! Ygnaiih! EEE-yaa-yaa—haa-haaa-haaaa! (In theoriginal voice neither human nor beast, yet both.)Ithaqua shall serve thee, Father of the million favored ones, and Zhar shall besummoned from Arcturus, by the command of ’Umr at-Tawil, Guardian of the Gate.…Ye shall unite in praise of Azathoth, of Great Cthulhu, of Tsathoggua.… (Thehuman voice again.)Go forth in his form or in whatever form chosen in the guise of man, and destroythat which may lead them to us.… (The half-bestial, half-human voice once more.)(An interlude of furious piping, accompanied once again by a sound as of theflapping of great wings.)Ygnaiih! Y’bthnk … b’ehye-n’grkdl’lh … Iä! Iä! Iä! (Like a chorus.)These sounds had been spaced in such a way that it seemed as if the beingsgiving rise to them were moving about within or around the lodge, and the lastchoral chanting faded away, as if the creatures were departing. Indeed, therefollowed such an interval of silence that Laird had actually moved to shut offthe machine when once again a voice came from it. But the voice that nowemanated from the dictaphone was one which, simply because of its nature,brought to a climax all the horror so cumulative in what had gone before it; forwhatever had been inferred by the half-bestial bellowings and chants, thehorribly suggestive conversation in accented English, that which now came fromthe dictaphone was unutterably terrible:Dorgan! Laird Dorgan! Can you hear me?A hoarse, urgent whisper calling out to my companion, who sat white-faced now,staring at the machine above which his hand was still poised. Our eyes met. Itwas not the appeal, it was not everything that had gone before, it was theidentity of that voice—for it was the voice of Professor Upton Gardner! But wehad no time to ponder this, for the dictaphone went mechanically on.“Listen to me! Leave this place. Forget. But before you go, summon Cthugha. Forcenturies this has been the place where evil beings from outermost cosmos havetouched upon earth. I know. I am theirs. They have taken me, as they tookPiregard and many others—all who came unwarily within their wood and whom theydid not at once destroy. It is His wood—the Wood of N’gai, the terrestrial abodeof the Blind, Faceless One, the Howler in the Night, the Dweller in Darkness,Nyarlathotep, who fears only Cthugha. I have been with him in the star spaces. Ihave been on the shunned Plateau of Leng—to Kadath in the Cold Waste, beyond theGates of the Silver Key, even to Kythamil near Arcturus and Mnar, to N’kai andthe Lake of Hali, to K’n-yan and fabled Carcosa, to Yaddith and Y’ha-nthlei nearInnsmouth, to Yoth and Yuggoth, and from far off I have looked upon Zothique,from the eye of Algol. When Fomalhaut has topped the trees, call forth toCthugha in these words, thrice repeated: Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthugha Fomalhautn’gha-ghaa naf’l thagn! Iä! Cthugha! When He has come, go swiftly, lest you,too, be destroyed. For it is fitting that this accursed spot be blasted so thatNyarlathotep comes no more out of interstellar space. Do you hear me, Dorgan? Doyou hear me? Dorgan! Laird Dorgan!”There was a sudden sound of sharp protest, followed by a scuffling and tearingnoise, as if Gardner had been forcibly removed, and then silence, utter andcomplete!For a few moments longer Laird let the record run, but there was nothing more,and finally he started it over, saying tensely, “I think we’d better copy thatas best we can. You take every other speech, and let’s both copy that formulafrom Gardner.”“Was it …?”“I’d know his voice anywhere,” he said shortly.“He’s alive then?”He looked at me, his eyes narrowed. “We don’t know that.”“But his voice!”He shook his head, for the sounds were coming forth once more, and both of ushad to bend to the task of copying, which was easier than it promised to be, forthe spaces between speeches were great enough to enable us to copy without unduehaste. The language of the chants and the words to Cthugha enunciated byGardner’s voice offered extreme difficulty, but by means of repeated playings,we managed to put down the approximate equivalent of the sounds. When finally wehad finished, Laird shut the dictaphone off and looked at me with quizzical andtroubled eyes, grave with concern and uncertainty. I said nothing; what we hadjust heard, added to everything that had gone before, left us no alternative.There was room for doubt about legends, beliefs, and the like—but the infalliblerecord of the dictaphone was conclusive even if it did no more than verifyhalf-heard credos—for it was true, there was still nothing definite; it was asif the whole were so completely beyond the comprehension of man that only in theoblique suggestion of its individual parts could something like understanding beachieved, as if the entirety were too unspeakably soul-searing for the mind ofman to withstand.“Fomalhaut rises almost at sunset—a little before, I think,” musedLaird—clearly, like myself, he had accepted what we had heard without challengeother than the mystery surrounding its meaning. “It should be above thetrees—presumably twenty to thirty degrees above the horizon, because it doesn’tpass near enough to the zenith in this latitude to appear above these pines—atapproximately an hour after darkness falls. Say nine-thirty or so.”“You aren’t thinking of trying it tonight?” I asked. “After all—what does itmean? Who or what is Cthugha?”“I don’t know any more than you. And I’m not trying it tonight. You’ve forgottenthe slab. Are you still game to go out there—after this?”I nodded. I did not trust myself to speak, but I was not consumed by anyeagerness whatever to dare the darkness that lingered like a living entitywithin the forest surrounding Rick’s Lake.Laird looked at his watch, and then at me, his eyes burning now with a kind offeverish determination, as if he were forcing himself to take this final step toface the unknown being whose manifestations had made the woods its own. If heexpected me to hesitate, he was disappointed; however beset by fear I might be,I would not show it. I got up and went out of the lodge at his side.IVThere are aspects of hidden life, exterior as well as of the depths of the mind,that are better kept secret and away from the awareness of common man; for therelurk in dark places of the earth horrible revenants belonging to a stratum ofthe subconscious which is mercifully beyond the apprehension of commonman—indeed, there are aspects of creation so grotesquely shuddersome that thevery sight of them would blast the sanity of the beholder. Fortunately, it isnot possible even to bring back in anything but suggestion what we saw on theslab in the forest at Rick’s Lake that night in October, for the thing was sounbelievable, transcending all known laws of science, that adequate words forits description have no existence in the language.We arrived at the belt of trees around the slab while afterglow yet lingered inthe western heavens, and by the illumination of a flashlight Laird carried, weexamined the face of the slab itself, and the carving on it: of a vast,amorphous creature, drawn by an artist who evidently lacked sufficientimagination to etch the creature’s face, for it had none, bearing only acurious, cone-like head which even in stone seemed to have a fluidity which wasunnerving; moreover, the creature was depicted as having both tentacle-likeappendages and hands—or growths similar to hands, not only two, but several; sothat it seemed both human and non-human in its structure. Beside it had beencarved two squat squid-like figures from a part of which—presumably the heads,though no outline was definitive—projected what must certainly have beeninstruments of some kind, for the strange, repugnant attendants appeared to beplaying them.Our examination was necessarily hurried, for we did not want to risk being seenhere by whatever might come, and it may be that in the circumstances,imagination got the better of us. But I do not think so. It is difficult tomaintain that consistently, sitting here at my desk, removed in space and timefrom what happened there; but I do maintain it. Despite the quickened awarenessand irrational fear of the unknown which obsessed both of us, we kept adetermined open-mindedness about every aspect of the problem we had chosen tosolve. If anything, I have erred in this account on the side of science overthat of imagination. In the plain light of reason, the carvings on that stoneslab were not only obscene, but bestial and frightening beyond measure,particularly in the light of what Partier had hinted, and what Gardner’s notesand the material from Miskatonic University had vaguely outlined, and even iftime had permitted, it is doubtful if we could have looked long upon them.We retreated to a spot comparatively near the way we must take to return to thelodge, and yet not too far from the open place where the slab lay, so that wemight see clearly and still remain hidden in a place easy of access to thereturn path. There we took our stand and waited in that chilling hush of anOctober evening, while stygian darkness encompassed us, and only one or twostars twinkled high overhead, miraculously visible among the towering treetops.According to Laird’s watch, we waited exactly an hour and ten minutes before thesound as of wind began, and at once there was a manifestation which had about itall the trappings of the supernatural; for no sooner had the rushing soundbegun, than the slab we had so quickly quitted began to glow—at first soindistinguishably that it seemed an illusion, and then with a phosphorescence ofincreasing brilliance, until it gave off such a glow that it was as if a pillarof light extended upward into the heavens. This was the second curiouscircumstance—the light followed the outlines of the slab, and flowed upward; itwas not diffused and dispersed around the glade and into the woods, but shoneheavenward with the insistence of a directed beam. Simultaneously, the very airseemed charged with evil; all around us lay thickly such an aura of fearsomenessthat it rapidly became impossible to remain free of it. It was apparent that bysome means unknown to us the rushing sound as of wind which now filled the airwas not only associated with the broad beam of light flowing upward, but wascaused by it; moreover, as we watched, the intensity and color of the lightvaried constantly, changing from a blinding white to a lambent green, from greento a kind of lavender; occasionally it was so intensely brilliant that it wasnecessary to avert our eyes, but for the most part it could be looked at withouthurt to our eyes.As suddenly as it had begun, the rushing sound stopped, the light became diffuseand dim; and almost immediately the weird piping as of flutes smote upon ourears. It came not from around us, but from above, and with one accord, both ofus turned to look as far into heaven as the now fading light would permit.Just what took place then before our eyes I cannot explain. Was it actuallysomething that came hurtling down, streaming down, rather?—for the masses wereshapeless—or was it the product of imagination that proved singularly uniformwhen later Laird and I found opportunity to compare notes? The illusion of greatblack things streaking down in the path of that light was so great that weglanced back at the slab.What we saw there sent us screaming voicelessly from that hellish spot.For, where but a moment before there had been nothing, there was now a giganticprotoplasmic mass, a colossal being who towered upward toward the stars, andwhose actual physical being was in constant flux; and flanking it on either sidewere two lesser beings, equally amorphous, holding pipes or flutes in appendagesand making that demoniac music which echoed and reechoed in the enclosingforest. But the thing on the slab, the Dweller in Darkness, was the ultimate inhorror; for from its mass of amorphous flesh there grew at will before our eyestentacles, claws, hands, and withdrew again; the mass itself diminished andswelled effortlessly, and where its head was and its features should have beenthere was only a blank facelessness all the more horrible because even as welooked there rose from its blind mass a low ululation in that half-bestial,half-human voice so familiar to us from the record made in the night!We fled, I say, so shaken that it was only by a supreme effort of will that wewere able to take flight in the right direction. And behind us the voice rose,the blasphemous voice of Nyarlathotep, the Blind, Faceless One, the MightyMessenger, even while there rang in the channels of memory the frightened wordsof the half-breed, Old Peter—It was a Thing—didn’t have no face, hollered theretill I thought my eardrums ’d bust, and them things that was withit—Gawd!—echoed there while the voice of that Being from outermost spaceshrieked and gibbered to the hellish music of the hideous attendingflute-players, rising to ululate through the forest and leave its mark foreverin memory!Y’gnaiih! Ygnaiih! EEE-yayayayayaaa-haaahaaahaaahaaa-ngh’aaa-ngh’aaa-ya-va-yaaa!Then all was still.And yet, incredible as it may seem, the ultimate horror awaited us.For we had gone but halfway to the lodge when we were simultaneously aware ofsomething following; behind us rose a hideous, horribly suggestive sloshingsound, as if the amorphous entity had left the slab which in some remote timemust have been erected by its worshippers, and was pursuing us. Obsessed byabysmal fright, we ran as neither of us has ever run before, and we were almostupon the lodge before we were aware that the sloshing sound, the trembling andshuddering of the earth—as if some gigantic being walked upon it—had ceased, andin their stead came only the calm, unhurried tread of footsteps.But the footsteps were not our own! And in the aura of unreality, the fearsomeoutsideness in which we walked and breathed, the suggestiveness of thosefootsteps was almost maddening!We reached the lodge, lit a lamp, and sank into chairs to await whatever it wasthat was coming so steadily, unhurriedly on, mounting the verandah steps,putting its hand on the knob of the door, swinging the door open.…It was Professor Gardner who stood there!Then Laird sprang up, crying, “Professor Gardner!”The professor smiled reservedly and put one hand up to shade his eyes. “If youdon’t mind, I’d like the light dimmed. I’ve been in the dark so long.…”Laird turned to do his bidding without question, and he came forward into theroom, walking with the ease and poise of a man who is as sure of himself as ifhe had never vanished from the face of the earth more than three months before,as if he had not made a frantic appeal to us during the night just past, as if.…I glanced at Laird; his hand was still at the lamp, but his fingers were nolonger turning down the wick, simply holding to it, while he gazed downunseeing. I looked over at Professor Gardner; he sat with his head turned fromthe lights, his eyes closed, a little smile playing about his lips; at thatmoment he looked precisely as I had often seen him look at the University Clubin Madison, and it was as if everything that had taken place here at the lodgewere but an evil dream.But it was not a dream!“You were gone last night?” asked the professor.“Yes. But, of course, we had the dictaphone.”“Ah. You heard something then?”“Would you like to hear the record, sir?”“Yes, I would.”Laird went over and put it on the machine to play it again, and we sat insilence, listening to everything upon it, no one saying anything until it hadbeen completed. Then the professor slowly turned his head.“What do you make of it?”“I don’t know what to make of it, sir,” answered Laird. “The speeches are toodisjointed—except for yours. There seems to be some coherence there.”Suddenly, without warning, the room was surcharged with menace; it was but amomentary impression, but Laird felt it as keenly as I did, for he startednoticeably. He was taking the record from the machine when the professor spokeagain.“It doesn’t occur to you that you may be the victim of a hoax?”“No.”“And if I told you that I had found it possible to make every sound that wasregistered on that record?”Laird looked at him for a full minute before replying in a low voice that, ofcourse, Professor Gardner had been investigating the phenomena of Rick’s Lakewoods for a far longer time than we had, and if he said so.…A harsh laugh escaped the professor. “Entirely natural phenomena, my boy!There’s a mineral deposit under that grotesque slab in the woods; it gives offlight and also a miasma that is productive of hallucinations. It’s as simple asthat. As for the various disappearances—sheer folly, human failing, nothingmore, but with the air of coincidence. I came here with high hopes of verifyingsome of the nonsense to which old Partier lent himself long ago—but—” He smileddisdainfully, shook his head, and extended his hand. “Let me have the record,Laird.”Without question, Laird gave Professor Gardner the record. The older man took itand was bringing it up before his eyes when he jogged his elbow and, with asharp cry of pain, dropped it. It broke into dozens of pieces on the floor ofthe lodge.“Oh!” cried the professor. “I’m sorry.” He turned his eyes on Laird. “Butthen—since I can duplicate it any time for you from what I’ve learned about thelore of this place, by way of Partier’s mouthings—” He shrugged.“It doesn’t matter,” said Laird quietly.“Do you mean to say that everything on that record was just your imagination,Professor?” I broke in. “Even that chant for the summoning of Cthugha?”The older man’s eyes turned on me; his smile was sardonic. “Cthugha? What do yousuppose he or that is but the figment of someone’s imagination? And theinference—my dear boy, use your head. You have before you the clear inferencethat Cthugha has his abode on Fomalhaut, which is twenty-seven light-years away,and that, if this chant is thrice repeated when Fomalhaut has risen Cthugha willappear to somehow render this place no longer habitable by man or outsideentity. How do you suppose that could be accomplished?”“Why, by something akin to thought-transference,” replied Laird doggedly. “It’snot unreasonable to suppose that if we were to direct thoughts toward Fomalhautthat something there might receive them—granting that there might be life there.Thought is instant. And that they in turn may be so highly developed thatdematerialization and rematerialization might be as swift as thought.”“My boy—are you serious?” The older man’s voice revealed his contempt.“You asked.”“Well, then, as the hypothetic answer to a theoretical problem, I can overlookthat.”“Frankly,” I said again, disregarding a curious negative shaking of Laird’shead, “I don’t think that what we saw in the forest tonight was justhallucination—caused by a miasma rising out of the earth or otherwise.”The effect of this statement was extraordinary. Visibly, the professor madeevery effort to control himself; his reactions were precisely those of a savantchallenged by a cretin in one of his classes. After a few moments he controlledhimself and said only, “You’ve been there then. I suppose it’s too late to makeyou believe otherwise.…”“I’ve always been open to conviction, sir, and I lean to the scientific method,”said Laird.Professor Gardner put his hand over his eyes and said, “I’m tired. I noticedlast night when I was here that you’re in my old room, Laird—so I’ll take theroom next to you, opposite Jack’s.”He went up the stairs as if nothing had happened between the last time he hadoccupied the lodge and this.VThe rest of the story—and the culmination of that apocalyptic night—are soontold.I could not have been asleep for more than an hour—the time was one in themorning—when I was awakened by Laird. He stood beside my bed fully dressed andin a tense voice ordered me to get up and dress, to pack whatever essentials Ihad brought, and be ready for anything. Nor would he permit me to put on a lightto do so, though he carried a small pocket-flash, and used it sparingly. To allmy questions, he cautioned me to wait.When I had finished, he led the way out of the room with a whispered, “Come.”He went directly to the room into which Professor Gardner had disappeared. Bythe light of his flash, it was evident that the bed had not been touched;moreover, in the faint film of dust that lay on the floor, it was clear thatProfessor Gardner had walked into the room, over to a chair beside the window,and out again.“Never touched the bed, you see,” whispered Laird.“But why?”Laird gripped my arm, hard. “Do you remember what Partier hinted—what we saw inthe woods—the protoplasmic, amorphousness of the thing? And what the recordsaid?”“But Gardner told us—” I protested.Without a further word, he turned. I followed him downstairs, where he paused atthe table where we had worked and flashed the light upon it. I was surprisedinto making a startled exclamation which Laird hushed instantly. For the tablewas bare of everything but the copy of The Outsider and Others and three copiesof Weird Tales, a magazine containing stories supplementing those in the book bythe eccentric Providence genius, Lovecraft. All Gardner’s notes, all our ownnotations, the photostats from Miskatonic University—everything gone!“He took them,” said Laird. “No one else could have done so.”“Where did he go?”“Back to the place from which he came.” He turned on me, his eyes gleaming inthe reflected glow of the flashlight. “Do you understand what that means, Jack?”I shook my head.“They know we’ve been there, they know we’ve seen and learned too much.…”“But how?”“You told them.”“I? Good God, man, are you mad? How could I have told them?”“Here, in this lodge, tonight—you yourself gave the show away, and I hate tothink of what might happen now. We’ve got to get away.”For one moment all the events of the past few days seemed to fuse into anunintelligible mass; Laird’s urgence was unmistakable, and yet the thing hesuggested was so utterly unbelievable that its contemplation even for sofleeting a moment threw my thoughts into the extremest confusion.Laird was talking now, quickly. “Don’t you think it odd—how he came back? How hecame out of the woods after the hellish thing we saw there—not before? And thequestions he asked—the drift of those questions. And how he managed to break therecord—our one scientific proof of something? And now, the disappearance of allthe notes—of everything that might point to substantiation of what he called‘Partier’s nonsense’?”“But if we are to believe what he told us.…”He broke in before I could finish. “One of them was right. Either the voice onthe record calling to me—or the man who was here tonight.”“The man …”But whatever I wanted to say was stilled by Laird’s harsh, “Listen!”From outside, from the depths of the horror-haunted dark, the earth-haven of theDweller in Darkness, came once more, for the second time that night, the weirdlybeautiful, yet cacophonous strains of flute-like music, rising and falling,accompanied by a kind of chanted ululation, and by the sound as of great wingsflapping.“Yes, I hear,” I whispered.“Listen closely!”Even as he spoke, I understood. There was something more—the sounds from theforest were not only rising and falling—they were approaching!“Now do you believe me?” demanded Laird. “They’re coming for us!” He turned onme. “The chant!”“What chant?” I fumbled stupidly.“The Cthugha chant—do you remember it?”“I took it down. I’ve got it here.”For an instant I was afraid that this, too, might have been taken from us, butit was not; it was in my pocket where I had left it. With shaking hands, Lairdtore the paper from my grasp.“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthugha Fomalhaut n’gha-ghaa naf’l thagn! Iä! Cthugha!” hesaid, running to the verandah, myself at his heels.Out of the woods came the bestial voice of the dweller in the dark.“Ee-ya-ya-haa-haahaaa! Ygnaiih! Ygnaiih!”“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthugha Fomalhaut n’gha-ghaa naf’l thagn! Iä! Cthugha!”repeated Laird for the second time.Still the ghastly melee of sounds from the woods came on, in no way diminished,rising now to supreme heights of terror-fraught fury, with the bestial voice ofthe thing from the slab added to the wild, mad music of the pipes, and the soundas of wings.And then, once more, Laird repeated the primal words of the chant.On the instant that the final guttural sound had left his lips, there began asequence of events no human eye was ever destined to witness. For suddenly thedarkness was gone, giving way to a fearsome amber glow; simultaneously theflute-like music ceased, and in its place rose cries of rage and terror. Then,there appeared thousands of tiny points of light—not only on and among thetrees, but on the earth itself, on the lodge and the car standing before it. Forstill a further moment we were rooted to the spot, and then it was borne in uponus that the myriad points of light were living entities of flame! For whereverthey touched, fire sprang up, seeing which, Laird rushed into the lodge for suchof our things as he could carry forth before the holocaust made it impossiblefor us to escape Rick’s Lake.He came running out—our bags had been downstairs—gasping that it was too late totake the dictaphone or anything else, and together we dashed toward the car,shielding our eyes a little from the blinding light all around. But even thoughwe had shielded our eyes, it was impossible not to see the great amorphousshapes streaming skyward from this accursed place, nor the equally great beinghovering like a cloud of living fire above the trees. So much we saw, before thefrightful struggle to escape the burning woods forced us to forget mercifullythe other details of that terrible, maddened flight.Horrible as were the things that took place in the darkness of the forest atRick’s Lake, there was something more cataclysmic still, something soblasphemously conclusive that even now I shudder and tremble uncontrollably tothink of it. For in that brief dash to the car, I saw something that explainedLaird’s doubt, I saw what had made him take heed of the voice on the record andnot of the thing that came to us as Professor Gardner. The keys were therebefore, but I did not understand; even Laird had not fully believed. Yet it wasgiven to us—we did not know. “It is not desired by the Old Ones that mere manshall know too much,” Partier had said. And that terrible voice on the recordhad hinted even more clearly: Go forth in his form or in whatever form chosen inthe guise of man, and destroy that which may lead them to us.… Destroy thatwhich may lead them to us! Our record, the notes, the photostats from MiskatonicUniversity, yes, and even Laird and myself! And the thing had gone forth, for itwas Nyarlathotep, the Mighty Messenger, the Dweller in Darkness who had goneforth and who had returned into the forest to send his minions back to us. Itwas he who had come from interstellar space even as Cthugha, the fire being, hadcome from Fomalhaut upon the utterance of the command that woke him from hiseon-long sleep under that amber star, the command that Gardner, the living-deadcaptive of the terrible Nyarlathotep, had discovered in those fantastictravelings in space and time; and it was he who returned whence he had come,with his earth-haven now forever rendered useless for him with its destructionby the minions of Cthugha!I know, and Laird knows. We never speak of it.If we had had any doubt, despite everything that had gone before, we could notforget that final, soul-searing discovery, the thing we saw when we shielded oureyes from the flames all around and looked away from those beings in theheavens, the line of footprints that led away from the lodge in the direction ofthat hellish slab deep in the black forest, the footprints that began in thesoft soil beyond the verandah in the shape of a man’s footprints, and changedwith each step into a hideously suggestive imprint made by a creature ofincredible shape and weight, with variations of outline and size so grotesque asto have been incomprehensible to anyone who had not seen the thing on theslab—and beside them, torn and rent as if by an expanding force, the clothingthat once belonged to Professor Gardner, left piece by piece along the trailback into the woods, the trail taken by the hellish monstrosity that had comeout of the night, the Dweller in Darkness who had visited us in the shape andguise of Professor Gardner!* Originally published in Weird Tales, November 1944."},{"pageContent":"BEYOND THE THRESHOLD*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]AUGUST DERLETH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]IThe story is really my grandfather’s.In a manner of speaking, however, it belongs to the entire family, and beyondthem, to the world; and there is no longer any reason for suppressing thesingularly terrible details of what happened in that lonely house deep in theforest places of northern Wisconsin.The roots of the story go back into the mists of early time, far beyond thebeginnings of the Alwyn family line, but of this I knew nothing at the time ofmy visit to Wisconsin in response to my cousin’s letter about our grandfather’sstrange decline in health. Josiah Alwyn had always seemed somehow immortal to meeven as a child, and he had not appeared to change throughout the years between:a barrel-chested old man, with a heavy, full face, decorated with a closelyclipped moustache and a small beard to soften the hard line of his square jaw.His eyes were dark, not overlarge, and his brows were shaggy; he wore his hairlong, so that his head had a leonine appearance. Though I saw little of him whenI was very young, still he left an indelible impression on me in the briefvisits he paid when he stopped at the ancestral country home near Arkham, inMassachusetts—those short calls he made on his way to and from remote corners ofthe world: Tibet, Mongolia, the Arctic regions, and certain little-known islandsin the Pacific.I had not seen him for years when the letter came from my cousin Frolin, wholived with him in the old house grandfather owned in the heart of the forest andlake country of northern Wisconsin. “I wish you could uproot yourself fromMassachusetts long enough to come out here. A great deal of water has passedunder various bridges, and the wind has blown about many changes since last youwere here. Frankly, I think it most urgent that you come. In presentcircumstances, I don’t know to whom to turn, grandfather being not himself, andI need someone who can be trusted.” There was nothing obviously urgent about theletter, and yet there was a queer constraint, there was something between linesthat stood out invisibly, intangibly, to make possible only one answer toFrolin’s letter—something in his phrase about the wind, something in the way hehad written grandfather being not himself, something in the need he hadexpressed for someone who can be trusted.I could easily take a leave of absence from my position as assistant librarianat Miskatonic University in Arkham and go west that September; so I went. Iwent, harassed by an almost uncanny conviction that the need for haste wasgreat: from Boston by plane to Chicago, and from there by train to the villageof Harmon, deep in the forest country of Wisconsin—a place of great naturalbeauty, not far from the shores of Lake Superior, so that it was possible ondays of wind and weather to hear the water’s sound.Frolin met me at the station. My cousin was in his late thirties then, but hehad the look of someone ten years younger, with hot, intense brown eyes, and asoft, sensitive mouth that belied his inner hardness. He was singularly sober,though he had always alternated between gravity and a kind of infectiouswildness—“the Irish in him,” as grandfather had once said. I met his eyes when Ishook his hand, probing for some clue to his withheld distress, but I saw onlythat he was indeed troubled, for his eyes betrayed him, even as the roiledwaters of a pond reveal disturbance below, though the surface may be as glass.“What is it?” I asked, when I sat at his side in the coupe, riding into thecountry of the tall pines. “Is the old man abed?”He shook his head. “Oh, no, nothing like that, Tony.” He shot me a queer,restrained glance. “You’ll see. You wait and see.”“What is it then?” I pressed him. “Your letter had the damndest sound.”“I hoped it would,” he said gravely.“And yet there was nothing I could put my finger on,” I admitted. “But it wasthere, nevertheless.”He smiled. “Yes, I knew you’d understand. I tell you, it’s beendifficult—extremely difficult. I thought of you a good many times before I satdown and wrote that letter, believe me!”“But if he’s not ill …? I thought you said he wasn’t himself.”“Yes, yes, so I did. You wait now, Tony; don’t be so impatient; you’ll see foryourself. It’s his mind, I think.”“His mind!” I felt a distinct wave of regret and shock at the suggestion thatgrandfather’s mind had given way; the thought that that magnificent brain hadretreated from sanity was intolerable, and I was loath to entertain it. “Surelynot!” I cried. “Frolin—what the devil is it?”He turned his troubled eyes on me once more. “I don’t know. But I think it’ssomething terrible. If it were only grandfather. But there’s the music—and thenthere are all the other things: the sounds and smells and—” He caught my amazedstare and turned away, almost with physical effort pausing in his talk. “But I’mforgetting. Don’t ask me anything more. Just wait. You’ll see for yourself.” Helaughed shortly, a forced laugh. “Perhaps it’s not the old man who’s losing hismind. I’ve thought of that sometimes, too—with reason.”I said nothing more, but there was beginning to mushroom up inside me now a kindof tense fear, and for some time I sat by his side, thinking only of Frolin andold Josiah Alwyn living together in that old house, unaware of the toweringpines all around, and the wind’s sound, and the fragrant pungence of leaf-firesmoke riding the wind out of the northwest. Evening came early to this country,caught in the dark pines, and, though afterglow still lingered in the west,fanning upward in a great wave of saffron and amethyst, darkness alreadypossessed the forest through which we rode. Out of the darkness came the criesof the great horned owls and their lesser cousins, the screech owls, making aneerie magic in the stillness broken otherwise only by the wind’s voice and thenoise of the car passing along the comparatively little-used road to the Alwynhouse.“We’re almost there,” said Frolin.The lights of the car passed over a jagged pine, lightning-struck years ago, andstanding still with two gaunt limbs arched like gnarled arms toward the road: anold landmark to which Frolin’s words called my attention, since he knew I wouldremember it but half a mile from the house.“If grandfather should ask,” he said then, “I’d rather you said nothing about mysending for you. I don’t know that he’d like it. You can tell him you were inthe Midwest and came up for a visit.”I was curious anew, but forbore to press Frolin further. “He does know I’mcoming, then?”“Yes. I said I had word from you and was going down to meet your train.”I could understand that if the old man thought Frolin had sent for me about hishealth, he would be annoyed and perhaps angry; and yet more than this wasimplied in Frolin’s request, more than just the simple salving of grandfather’spride. Once more that odd, intangible alarm rose up within me, that sudden,inexplicable feeling of fear.The house looked forth suddenly in a clearing among the pines. It had been builtby an uncle of grandfather’s in Wisconsin’s pioneering days, back in the 1850s:by one of the seafaring Alwyns of Innsmouth, that strange, dark town on theMassachusetts coast. It was an unusually unattractive structure, snug againstthe hillside like a crusty old woman in furbelows. It defied many architecturalstandards without, however, seeming ever fully free of most of the superficialfacets of architecture circa 1850, making for the most grotesque and pompousappearance of structures of that day. It suffered a wide verandah, one side ofwhich led directly into the stables where, in former days, horses, surreys, andbuggies had been kept, and where now two cars were housed—the only corner of thebuilding which gave any evidence at all of having been remodeled since it wasbuilt. The house rose two and one-half stories above a cellar floor; presumably,for darkness made it impossible to ascertain, it was still painted the samehideous brown; and judging by what light shone forth from the curtained windows,grandfather had not yet taken the trouble to install electricity, a contingencyfor which I had come well prepared by carrying a flashlight and an electriccandle, with extra batteries for both.Frolin drove into the garage, left the car, and carrying some of my baggage, ledthe way down the verandah to the front door, a massive, thick-paneled oak piece,decorated with a ridiculously large iron knocker. The hall was dark, save for apartly open door at the far end, out of which came a faint light which was yetenough to illumine spectrally the broad stairs leading to the upper floor.“I’ll take you to your room first,” said Frolin, leading the way up the stairs,surefooted with habitual walking there. “There’s a flashlight on the newel postat the landing,” he added. “If you need it. You know the old man.”I found the light and lit it, making only enough delay so that when I caught upwith Frolin, he was standing at the door of my room, which, I noticed, wasalmost directly over the front entrance and thus faced west, as did the houseitself.“He’s forbidden us to use any of the rooms east of the hall up here,” saidFrolin, fixing me with his eyes, as much as to say: You see how queer he’s got!He waited for me to say something, but since I did not, he went on. “So I havethe room next to yours, and Hough is on the other side of me, in the southwestcorner. Right now, as you might have noticed, Hough’s getting something to eat.”“And grandfather?”“Very likely in his study. You’ll remember that room.”I did indeed remember that curious windowless room, built under explicitdirections by Great-Uncle Leander, a room that occupied the majority of the rearof the house, the entire northwest corner and all the west width save for asmall corner at the southwest, where the kitchen was, the kitchen from which alight had streamed into the lower hall at our entrance. The study had beenpushed partway back into the hill slope, so the east wall could not havewindows, but there was no reason save Uncle Leander’s eccentricity for thewindowless north wall. Squarely in the center of the east wall, indeed, builtinto the wall, was an enormous painting, reaching from the floor to the ceilingand occupying a width of over six feet. If this painting, apparently executed bysome unknown friend of Uncle Leander’s, if not by my great-uncle himself, hadhad about it any mark of genius or even of unusual talent, this display mighthave been overlooked, but it did not, it was a perfectly prosaic representationof a north country scene, showing a hillside, with a rocky cave opening out intothe center of the picture, a scarcely defined path leading to the cave, animpressionistic beast which was evidently meant to resemble a bear, once commonin this country, walking toward it, and overhead something that looked like anunhappy cloud lost among the pines rising darkly all around. This dubious workof art completely and absolutely dominated the study, despite the shelves ofbooks that occupied almost every available niche in what remained of the wallsin that room, despite the absurd collection of oddities strewn everywhere—bitsof curiously carven stone and wood, strange mementos of great-uncle’s seafaringlife. The study had all the lifelessness of a museum, and yet, oddly, itresponded to my grandfather like something alive, even the painting on the wallseeming to take on an added freshness whenever he entered.“I don’t think anyone who ever stepped into that room could forget it,” I saidwith a grim smile.“He spends most of his time there. Hardly goes out at all, and I suppose, withwinter coming on, he’ll come out only for his meals. He’s moved his bed, too.”I shuddered. “I can’t imagine sleeping in that room.”“No, nor I. But you know, he’s working on something, and I sincerely believe hismind has been affected.”“Another book on his travels, perhaps?”He shook his head. “No, a translation, I think. Something different. He foundsome old papers of Leander’s one day, and ever since then he seems to have gotprogressively worse.” He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. “Come on. Hough willhave supper ready by this time, and you’ll see for yourself.”Frolin’s cryptic remarks had led me to expect an emaciated old man. After all,grandfather was in his early seventies, and even he could not be expected tolive forever. But he had not changed physically at all, as far as I could see.There he sat at his supper table—still the same hardy old man, his moustache andbeard not yet white, but only iron grey, and still with plenty of black in them;his face was no less heavy, his color no less ruddy. At the moment of myentrance he was eating heartily from the drumstick of a turkey. Seeing me, heraised his eyebrows a little, took the drumstick from his lips, and greeted mewith no more excitement than if I had been away from him but half an hour.“You’re looking well,” he said.“And you,” I said. “An old war-horse.”He grinned. “My boy, I’m on the trail of something new—some unexplored countryapart from Africa, Asia, and the Arctic regions.”I flashed a glance at Frolin. Clearly, this was news to him; whatever hintsgrandfather might have dropped of his activities, they had not included this.He asked then about my trip west, and the rest of the supper hour was taken upwith small talk of other relatives. I observed that the old man returnedinsistently to long-forgotten relatives in Innsmouth: What had become of them?Had I ever seen them? What did they look like? Since I knew practically nothingof the relatives in Innsmouth, and had the firm conviction that all had died ina strange catastrophe which had washed many inhabitants of that shunned city outto sea, I was not helpful. But the tenor of these innocuous questions puzzled meno little. In my capacity as librarian at Miskatonic University, I had heardstrange and disturbing hints of the business in Innsmouth, I knew something ofthe appearance of Federal men there, and stories of foreign agents had never hadabout them that essential ring of truth which made a plausible explanation forthe terrible events which had taken place in that city. He wanted to know atlast whether I had ever seen pictures of them, and when I said I had not, he wasquite patently disappointed.“Do you know,” he said dejectedly, “there does not exist even a likeness ofUncle Leander, but the old-timers around Harmon told me years ago that he was avery homely man, that he reminded them of a frog.” Abruptly, he seemed moreanimated, he began to talk a little faster. “Do you have any conception of whatthat means, my boy? But no, you wouldn’t have. It’s too much to expect.…”He sat for a while in silence, drinking his coffee, drumming on the table withhis fingers and staring into space with a curiously preoccupied air untilsuddenly he rose and left the room, inviting us to come to the study when we hadfinished.“What do you make of that?” asked Frolin, when the sound of the study doorclosing came to us.“Curious,” I said. “But I see nothing abnormal there, Frolin. I’m afraid.…”He smiled grimly. “Wait. Don’t judge yet; you’ve been here scarcely two hours.”We went to the study after supper, leaving the dishes to Hough and his wife, whohad served my grandfather for twenty years in this house. The study wasunchanged, save for the addition of the old double bed, pushed up against thewall which separated the room from the kitchen. Grandfather was clearly waitingfor us, or rather for me, and, if I had had occasion to think cousin Frolincryptic, there is no word adequate to describe my grandfather’s subsequentconversation.“Have you ever heard of the Wendigo?” he asked.I admitted that I had come upon it among other north country Indian legends: thebelief in a monstrous, supernatural being, horrible to look upon, the haunter ofthe great forest silences.He wanted to know whether I had ever thought of there being a possibleconnection between this legend of the Wendigo and the air elements, and upon myreplying in the affirmative, he expressed a curiosity about how I had come toknow the Indian legend in the first place, taking pains to explain that theWendigo had nothing whatever to do with his question.“In my capacity as a librarian, I have occasion to run across a good manyout-of-the-way things,” I answered.“Ah!” he exclaimed, reaching for a book next to his chair. “Then doubtless youmay be familiar with this volume.”I looked at the heavy black-bound volume whose title was stamped only on itsbackbone in goldleaf. The Outsider and Others, by H. P. Lovecraft.I nodded. “This book is on our shelves.”“You’ve read it, then?”“Oh, yes. Most interesting.”“Then you’ll have read what he has to say about Innsmouth in his strange story,‘The Shadow Over Innsmouth.’ What do you make of that?”I reflected hurriedly, thinking back to the story, and presently it came to me:a fantastic tale of horrible sea-beings, spawn of Cthulhu, beast of primordialorigin, living deep in the sea.“The man had a good imagination,” I said.“Had! Is he dead, then?”“Yes, three years ago.”“Alas! I had thought to learn from him.…”“But, surely, this fiction …” I began.He stopped me. “Since you have offered no explanation of what took place inInnsmouth, how can you be so sure that his narrative is fiction?”I admitted that I could not, but it seemed that the old man had already lostinterest. Now he drew forth a bulky envelope bearing many of the familiarthree-cent 1869 stamps so dear to collectors, and from this took out variouspapers, which, he said, Uncle Leander had left with instructions for theirconsignment to the flames. His wish, however, had not been carried out,explained grandfather, and he had come into possession of them. He handed a fewsheets to me, and requested my opinion of them, watching me shrewdly all thewhile.The sheets were obviously from a long letter, written in a crabbed hand, andwith some of the most awkward sentences imaginable. Moreover, many of thesentences did not seem to me to make sense, and the sheet at which I lookedlongest was filled with allusions strange to me. My eyes caught words likeIthaqua, Lloigor, Hastur; it was not until I handed the sheets back to mygrandfather that it occurred to me that I had seen those words elsewhere, nottoo long ago. But I said nothing. I explained that I could not help feeling thatUncle Leander wrote with needless obfuscation.Grandfather chuckled. “I should have thought that the first thing which wouldhave occurred to you would have been similar to my own reaction, but no, youfailed me! Surely it’s obvious that the whole business is a code!”“Of course! That would explain the awkwardness of his lines.”My grandfather smirked. “A fairly simple code, but adequate—entirely adequate. Ihave not yet finished with it.” He tapped the envelope, with one index finger.“It seems to concern this house, and there is in it a repeated warning that onemust be careful, and not pass beyond the threshold, for fear of direconsequences. My boy, I’ve crossed and recrossed every threshold in this housescores of times, and there have been no consequences. So therefore, somewherethere must exist a threshold I have not yet crossed.”I could not help smiling at his animation. “If Uncle Leander’s mind waswandering, you’ve been off on a pretty chase,” I said.Abruptly grandfather’s well-known impatience boiled to the surface. With onehand he swept my uncle’s papers away; with the other he dismissed us both, andit was plain to see that Frolin and I had on the instant ceased to exist forhim.We rose, made our excuses, and left the room.In the half-dark of the hall beyond, Frolin looked at me, saying nothing, onlypermitting his hot eyes to dwell upon mine for a long minute before he turnedand led the way upstairs, where we parted, each to go to his own room for thenight.IIThe nocturnal activity of the subconscious mind has always been of deep interestto me, since it has seemed to me that unlimited opportunities are opened upbefore every alert individual. I have repeatedly gone to bed with some problemvexing me, only to find it solved, insofar as I am capable of solving it, uponwaking. Of those other, more devious activities of the night mind, I have lessknowledge. I know that I retired that night with the question of where I hadencountered my Uncle Leander’s strange words before strong and foremost in mind,and I know that I went to sleep at last with that question unanswered.Yet, when I awoke in the darkness some hours later, I knew at once that I haveseen those words, those strange proper names in the book by H. P. Lovecraftwhich I had read at Miskatonic, and it was only secondarily that I was aware ofsomeone tapping at my door, and called out in a hushed voice.“It’s Frolin. Are you awake? I’m coming in.”I got up, slipped on my dressing gown, and lit my electric candle. By this timeFrolin was in the room, his thin body trembling a little, possibly from thecold, for the September night air flowing through my window was no longer ofsummer.“What’s the matter?” I asked.He came over to me, a strange light in his eyes, and put a hand on my arm.“Can’t you hear it?” he asked. “God, perhaps it is my mind.…”“No, wait!” I exclaimed.From somewhere outside, it seemed, came the sound of weirdly beautiful music:flutes, I thought.“Grandfather’s at the radio,” I said. “Does he often listen so late?”The expression on his face halted my words. “I own the only radio in the house.It’s in my room, and it’s not playing. The battery’s run down, in any case.Besides, did you ever hear such music on the radio?”I listened with renewed interest. The music seemed strangely muffled, and yet itcame through. I observed also that it had no definite direction; while before ithad seemed to come from outside, it now seemed to come from underneath thehouse—a curious, chant-like playing of reeds and pipes.“A flute orchestra,” I said.“Or Pan pipes,” said Frolin.“They don’t play them anymore,” I said absently.“Not on the radio,” answered Frolin.I looked up at him sharply; he returned my gaze as steadily. It occurred to methat his unnatural gravity had a reason for being, whether or not he wished toput that reason into words. I caught hold of his arms.“Frolin—what is it? I can tell you’re alarmed.”He swallowed hard. “Tony, that music doesn’t come from anything in the house.It’s from outside.”“But who would be outside?” I demanded.“Nothing—no one human.”It had come at last. Almost with relief I faced this issue I had been afraid toadmit to myself must be faced. Nothing—no one human.“Then—what agency?” I asked.“I think grandfather knows,” he said. “Come with me, Tony. Leave the light; wecan make our way in the dark.”Out in the hall, I was stopped once more by his hand tense on my arm. “Do younotice?” he whispered sibilantly. “Do you notice this, too?”“The smell,” I said. The vague, elusive smell of water, of fish and frogs andthe inhabitants of watery places.“And now!” he said.Quite suddenly the smell of water was gone, and instead came a swift frostiness,flowing through the hall as of something alive, the indefinable fragrance ofsnow, the crisp moistness of snowy air.“Do you wonder I’ve been concerned?” asked Frolin.Giving me no time to reply, he led the way downstairs to the door ofgrandfather’s study, beneath which there shone yet a fine line of yellow light.I was conscious in every step of our descent to the floor below that the musicwas growing louder, if no more understandable, and now, before the study door,it was apparent that the music emanated from within, and that the strangevariety of odors came, too, from that study. The darkness seemed alive withmenace, charged with an impending, ominous terror, which enclosed us as in ashell, so that Frolin trembled at my side.Impulsively I raised my arm and knocked on the door.There was no answer from within, but on the instant of my knock, the musicstopped, the strange odors vanished from the air!“You shouldn’t have done that!” whispered Frolin. “If he …”I tried the door. It yielded to my pressure, and I opened it.I do not know what I expected to see there in the study, but certainly not whatI did see. No single aspect of the room had changed, save that grandfather hadgone to bed, and now sat there with his eyes closed and a little smile on hislips, some of his work open before him on the bed, and the lamp burning. I stoodfor an instant staring, not daring to believe my eyes, incredulous before theprosaic scene I looked upon. Whence then had come the music I had heard? And theodors and fragrances in the air? Confusion took possession of my thoughts, and Iwas about to withdraw, disturbed by the repose of my grandfather’s features,when he spoke.“Come in, then,” he said, without opening his eyes. “So you heard the music,too? I had begun to wonder why no one else heard it. Mongolian, I think. Threenights ago, it was clearly Indian—north country again, Canada and Alaska. Ibelieve there are places where Ithaqua is still worshipped. Yes, yes—and a weekago, notes I last heard played in Tibet, in forbidden Lhasa years ago, decadesago.”“Who made it?” I cried. “Where did it come from?”He opened his eyes and regarded us standing there. “It came from here, I think,”he said, placing the flat of one hand on the manuscript before him, the sheetswritten by my great-uncle. “And Leander’s friends made it. Music of the spheres,my boy—do you credit your senses?”“I heard it. So did Frolin.”“And what can Hough be thinking?” mused grandfather. He sighed. “I have nearlygot it, I think. It only remains to determine with which of them Leandercommunicated.”“Which?” I repeated. “What do you mean?”He closed his eyes and the smile came briefly back to his lips. “I thought atfirst it was Cthulhu; Leander was, after all, a seafaring man. But now—I wonderif it might not be one of the creatures of the air: Lloigor, perhaps—or Ithaqua,whom I believe certain of the Indians call the Wendigo. There is a legend thatIthaqua carries his victims with him in the far spaces above the earth—but I amforgetting myself again, my mind wanders.” His eyes flashed open, and I foundhim regarding us with a peculiarly aloof stare. “It’s late,” he said. “I needsleep.”“What in God’s name was he talking about?” asked Frolin in the hall.“Come along,” I said.But, back in my room once more, with Frolin waiting expectantly to hear what Ihad to say, I did not know how to begin. How would I tell him about the weirdknowledge hidden in the forbidden texts at Miskatonic University—the dread Bookof Eibon, the obscure Pnakotic Manuscripts, the terrible R’lyeh Text, and, mostshunned of all, the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred? How could I sayto him with any conviction at all the things that crowded into my mind as aresult of hearing my grandfather’s strange words, the memories that boiled upfrom deep within—of powerful Ancient Ones, elder beings of unbelievable evil,old gods who once inhabited the earth and all the universe as we know it now,and perhaps far more—old gods of ancient good, and forces of ancient evil, ofwhom the latter were now in leash, and yet ever breaking forth, becomingmanifest briefly, horribly, to the world of men. And their terrible names cameback now, if before this hour my clue to remembrance had not been made strongenough, had been refused in the fastnesses of my inherent prejudices—Cthulhu,potent leader of the forces of the waters of earth; Yog-Sothoth and Tsathoggua,dwellers in the depths of earth; Lloigor, Hastur, and Ithaqua, the Snow-Thing,and Wind-Walker, who were the elementals of air. It was of these beings thatgrandfather had spoken; and the inference he had made was too plain to bedisregarded, or even to be subject to any other interpretations—that myGreat-Uncle Leander, whose home, after all, had once been in the shunned and nowdeserted city of Innsmouth, had had traffic with at least one of these beings.And there was a further inference that he had not made, but only hinted at insomething he had said earlier in the evening—that there was somewhere in thehouse a threshold, beyond which a man dared not walk, and what danger could lurkbeyond that threshold but the path back into time, the way back to that hideouscommunication with the elder beings my Uncle Leander had had!And yet somehow, the full import of grandfather’s words had not dawned upon me.Though he had said so much, there was far more he had left unsaid, and I couldnot blame myself later for not fully realizing that grandfather’s activitieswere clearly bent toward discovering that hidden threshold of which UncleLeander had so cryptically written—and crossing it! In the confusion of thoughtto which I had now come in my preoccupation with the ancient mythology ofCthulhu, Ithaqua, and the elder gods, I did not follow the obvious indicationsto that logical conclusion, possibly because I feared instinctively to go sofar.I turned to Frolin and explained to him as clearly as I could. He listenedattentively, asking a few pointed questions from time to time, and, though hepaled slightly at certain details I could not refrain from mentioning, he didnot seem to be as incredulous as I might have thought. This in itself wasevidence of the fact that there was still more to be discovered about mygrandfather’s activities and the occurrences in the house, though I did notimmediately realize this. However, I was shortly to discover more of theunderlying reason for Frolin’s ready acceptance of my necessarily sketchyoutline.In the middle of a question, he ceased talking abruptly, and there came into hiseyes an expression indicating that his attention had passed from me, from theroom to somewhere beyond; he sat in an attitude of listening, and, impelled byhis own actions, I, too, strained to hear what he heard.Only the wind’s voice in the trees, rising now a little, I thought. A stormcoming.“Do you hear it?” he said in a shaky whisper.“No,” I said quietly. “Only the wind.”“Yes, yes—the wind. I wrote you, remember. Listen.”“Now, come, Frolin, take hold of yourself. It’s only the wind.”He gave me a pitying glance and, going to the window, beckoned me after him. Ifollowed, coming to his side. Without a word he pointed into the darknesspressing close to the house. It took me a moment to accustom myself to thenight, but presently I was able to see the line of trees struck sharply againstthe star-swept heavens. And then, instantly, I understood.Though the sound of the wind roared and thundered about the house, nothingwhatever disturbed the trees before my eyes—not a leaf, not a treetop, not atwig, swayed by so much as a hair’s breadth!“Good God!” I exclaimed, and fell back, away from the pane, as if to shut thesight from my eyes.“Now, you see,” he said, stepping back from the window, also. “I have heard allthis before.”He stood quietly, as if waiting, and I, too, waited. The sound of the windcontinued unabated; it had by this time reached a frightful intensity, so thatit seemed as if the old house must be torn from the hillside and hurtled intothe valley below. Indeed, a faint trembling made itself manifest even as Ithought this: a strange tremor, as if the house were shuddering, and thepictures on the walls made a slight, almost stealthy movement, almostimperceptible, and yet quite unmistakably visible. I glanced at Frolin, but hisfeatures were not disquieted; he continued to stand, listening and waiting, sothat it was patent that the end of this singular manifestation was not yet. Thewind’s sound was now a terrible, demoniac howling, and it was accompanied bynotes of music, which must have been audible for some time, but were soperfectly blended with the wind’s voice that I was not at first aware of them.The music was similar to that which had gone before, as of pipes andoccasionally stringed instruments, but was now much wilder, sounding with aterrifying abandon, with a character of unmentionable evil about it. At the sametime, two further manifestations occurred. The first was the sound as of someonewalking, some great being whose footsteps seemed to flow into the room from theheart of the wind itself; certainly they did not originate in the house, thoughthere was about them the unmistakable swelling which betokened their approach tothe house. The second was the sudden change in the temperature.The night outside was warm for September in upstate Wisconsin, and the house,too, had been reasonably comfortable. Now, abruptly, coincident with theapproaching footsteps, the temperature began to drop rapidly, so that in alittle while the air in the room was cold, and both Frolin and I had to put onmore clothing in order to keep comfortable. Still this did not seem to be theheight of the manifestations for which Frolin so obviously waited; he continuedto stand, saying nothing, though his eyes, meeting mine from time to time, wereeloquent enough to speak his mind. How long we stood there, listening to thosefrightening sounds from outside, before the end came, I do not know.But suddenly Frolin caught my arm and, in a hoarse whisper, cried, “There! Therethey are! Listen!”The tempo of the weird music had changed abruptly to a diminuendo from itsprevious wild crescendo; there came into it now a strain of almost unbearablesweetness, with a little of melancholy to it, music as lovely as previously ithad been evil, and yet the note of terror was not completely absent. At the sametime, there was apparent the sound of voices, raised in a kind of swellingchant, rising from the back of the house somewhere—as if from the study.“Great God in Heaven!” I cried, seizing Frolin. “What is it now?”“It’s grandfather’s doing,” he said. “Whether he knows it or not, that thingcomes and sings to him.” He shook his head and closed his eyes tightly for aninstant before saying bitterly in a low, intense voice, “If only that accursedpaper of Leander’s had been burned as it ought to have been!”“You could almost make out the words,” I said, listening intently.There were words—but not words I had ever heard before: a kind of horrible,primeval mouthing, as if some bestial creature with but half a tongue ululatedsyllables of meaningless horror. I went over and opened the door; immediatelythe sounds seemed clearer, so that it was evident that what I had mistaken formany voices was but one, which could nevertheless convey the illusion of many.Words—or perhaps I had better write sounds, bestial sounds—rose from below, akind of awe-inspiring ululation:“Iä! Iä! Ithaqua! Ithaqua cf’ayak: vulgtmm. Iä! Uhg! Cthulhu fhtagn!Sbub-Niggurath! Ithaqua naflfhtagn!”Incredibly, the wind’s voice rose to howl ever more terribly, so that I thoughtat any moment the house would be hurled into the void, and Frolin and myselftorn from its rooms, and the breath sucked from our helpless bodies. In theconfusion of fear and wonder that held me, I thought at that instant ofgrandfather in the study below, and beckoning Frolin, I ran from the room to thestairs, determined, despite my ghastly fright, to put myself between the old manand whatever menaced him. I ran to his door and flung myself upon it—and oncemore, as before, all manifestations stopped: as if by the flick of a switch,silence fell like a pall of darkness upon the house, a silence that wasmomentarily even more terrible.The door gave, and once more I faced grandfather.He was sitting still as we had left him but a short time before, though now hiseyes were open, his head was cocked a little to one side, and his gaze was fixedupon the overlarge painting on the east wall.“In God’s name!” I cried. “What was that?”“I hope to find out before long,” he answered with great dignity and gravity.His utter lack of fear quieted my own alarm to some degree, and I came a littlefarther into the room, Frolin following. I leaned over his bed, striving to fixhis attention upon me, but he continued to gaze at the painting with singularintensity.“What are you doing?” I demanded. “Whatever it is, there’s danger in it.”“An explorer like your grandfather would hardly be content if there were not, myboy,” he replied crisply, matter-of-factly.I knew it was true.“I would rather die with my boots on than here in this bed,” he went on. “As forwhat we heard—I don’t know how much of it you heard—that’s something for themoment not yet explicable. But I would call to your attention the strange actionof the wind.”“There was no wind,” I said. “I looked.”“Yes, yes,” he said a little impatiently. “True enough. And yet the wind’s soundwas there, and all the voices of the wind—just as I have heard it singing inMongolia, in the great snowy spaces, over the shunned and hidden Plateau of Lengwhere the Tcho-Tcho people worship strange ancient gods.” He turned to face mesuddenly, and I thought his eyes feverish. “I did tell you, didn’t I, about theworship of Ithaqua, sometimes called Wind-Walker, and by some, surely, theWendigo, by certain Indians in upper Manitoba, and of their beliefs that theWind-Walker takes human sacrifices and carries them over the far places of theearth before leaving them behind, dead at last? Oh, there are stories, my boy,odd legends—and something more.” He leaned toward me now with a fierceintensity. “I have myself seen things—things found on a body dropped from theair—just that—things that could not possibly have been got in Manitoba, thingsbelonging to Leng, to the Pacific Isles.” He brushed me away with one arm, andan expression of disgust crossed his face. “You don’t believe me. You think I’mwandering. Go on then, go back to your little sleep, and wait for your lastthrough the eternal misery of monotonous day after day!”“No! Say it now. I’m in no mood to go.”“I will talk to you in the morning,” he said tiredly, leaning back.With that I had to be content; he was adamant, and could not be moved. I badehim good-night once more and retreated into the hall with Frolin, who stoodthere shaking his head slowly, forbiddingly.“Every time a little worse,” he whispered. “Every time the wind blows a littlelouder, the cold comes more intensely, the voices and the music more clearly—andthe sound of those terrible footsteps!”He turned away and began to retrace the way upstairs, and, after a moment ofhesitation, I followed.In the morning my grandfather looked his usual picture of good health. At themoment of my entrance into the dining room, he was speaking to Hough, evidentlyin answer to a request, for the old servant stood respectfully bowed, while heheard grandfather tell him that he and Mrs. Hough might indeed take a week off,beginning today, if it was necessary for Mrs. Hough’s health that she go toWausau to consult a specialist. Frolin met my eyes with a grim smile; his colorhad faded a little, leaving him pale and sleepless-looking, but he ate heartilyenough. His smile, and the brief indicative glance of his eyes toward Hough’sretreating back, said clearly that this necessity which had come upon Hough andhis wife was their way of fighting the manifestations which had so disturbed myown first night in the house.“Well, my boy,” said grandfather quite cheerfully, “you’re not looking nearly ashaggard as you did last night. I confess, I felt for you. I daresay also youaren’t nearly so skeptical as you were.”He chuckled, as if this were a subject for joking. I could not, unfortunately,feel the same way about it. I sat down and began to eat a little, glancing athim from time to time, waiting for him to begin his explanation of the strangeevents of the previous night. Since it became evident shortly that he did notintend to explain, I was impelled to ask for an explanation, and did so with asmuch dignity as possible.“I’m sorry if you’ve been disturbed,” he said. “The fact of the matter is thatthat threshold of which Leander wrote must be in that study somewhere, and Ifelt quite certain I was onto it last night, before you burst into my room thesecond time. Furthermore, it seems undisputable that at least one member of thefamily has had traffic with one of those beings—Leander, obviously.”Frolin leaned forward. “Do you believe in them?”Grandfather smiled unpleasantly. “It must be obvious that, whatever myabilities, the disturbance you heard last night could hardly have been caused byme.”“Yes, of course,” agreed Frolin. “But some other agency …”“No, no—it remains to be determined only which one. The water smells are thesign of the spawn of Cthulhu, but the winds might be Lloigor or Ithaqua orHastur. But the stars aren’t right for Hastur,” he went on. “So we are left withthe other two. There they are, then, or one of them, just across that threshold.I want to know what lies beyond that threshold, if I can find it.”It seemed incredible that my grandfather should be talking so unconcernedlyabout these ancient beings; his prosaic air was in itself almost as alarming ashad been the night’s occurrences. The temporary feeling of security I had had atthe sight of him eating breakfast was washed away; I began to be conscious againof that slowly growing fear I had known on my way to the house last evening, andI regretted having pushed my inquiry.If my grandfather were aware of anything of this, he made no sign. He went ontalking much in the manner of a lecturer pursuing a scientific inquiry for thebenefit of an audience before him. It was obvious, he said, that a connectionexisted between the happenings at Innsmouth and Leander Alwyn’s non-humancontact outside. Did Leander leave Innsmouth originally because of the cult ofCthulhu that existed there, because he, too, was becoming afflicted with thatcurious facial change which overtook so many of the inhabitants of accursedInnsmouth?—those strange batrachian lineaments which horrified the Federalinvestigators who came to examine into the Innsmouth affair? Perhaps this wasso. In any event, leaving the Cthulhu cult behind, he had made his way into thewilds of Wisconsin and somehow he had established contact with another of theelder beings, Lloigor or Ithaqua—all, to be noted, elemental forces of evil.Leander Alwyn was apparently a wicked man.“If there is any truth to this,” I cried, “then surely Leander’s warning oughtto be observed. Give up this mad hope of finding the threshold of which hewrites!”Grandfather gazed at me for a moment with speculative mildness; but it was plainto see that he was not actually concerning himself with my outburst. “Now I’veembarked upon this exploration, I mean to keep to it. After all, Leander died anatural death.”“But, following your own theory, he had traffic with these—these things,” Isaid. “You have none. You’re daring to venture out into unknown space—it comesto that—without regard for what horrors might lie there.”“When I went into Mongolia, I encountered horrors, too. I never thought toescape Leng with my life.” He paused reflectively, and then rose slowly. “No, Imean to discover Leander’s threshold. And tonight, no matter what you hear, trynot to interrupt me. It would be a pity, if after so long a time, I am stillfurther delayed by your impetuosity.”“And having discovered the threshold,” I cried. “What then?”“I’m not sure I’ll want to cross it.”“The choice may not be yours.”He looked at me for a moment in silence, smiled gently, and left the room.IIIOf the events of that catastrophic night, I find it difficult even at this latedate to write, so vividly do they return to mind, despite the prosaicsurroundings of Miskatonic University where so many of those dread secrets arehidden in ancient and little-known texts. And yet, to understand the widespreadoccurrences that came after, the events of that night must be known.Frolin and I spent most of the day investigating my grandfather’s books andpapers, in search of verification of certain legends he had hinted at in hisconversation, not only with me, but with Frolin even before my arrival.Throughout his work occurred many cryptic allusions, but only one narrative atall relative to our inquiry—a somewhat obscure story, clearly of legendaryorigin, concerning the disappearance of two residents of Nelson, Manitoba, and aconstable of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and their subsequentreappearance, as if dropped from the heavens, frozen and either dead or dying,babbling of Ithaqua, of the Wind-Walker, and of many places on the face of theearth, and carrying with them strange objects, mementos of far places, whichthey had never been known to carry in life. The story was incredible, and yet itwas related to the mythology so clearly put down in The Outsider and Others, andeven more horribly narrated in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the R’lyeh Text, andthe terrible Necronomicon.Apart from this, we found nothing tangible enough to relate to our problem, andwe resigned ourselves to waiting for the night.At luncheon and dinner, prepared by Frolin in the absence of the Houghs, mygrandfather carried on as normally he was accustomed to, making no reference tohis strange exploration, beyond saying that he now had definite proof thatLeander had painted that unattractive landscape on the east wall of the study,and that he hoped soon, as he neared the end of the deciphering of Leander’slong, rambling letter, to find the essential clue to that threshold of which hewrote, and to which he now alluded increasingly. When he rose from the dinnertable, he solemnly cautioned us once more not to interrupt him in the night,under pain of his extreme displeasure, and so departed into that study out ofwhich he never walked again.“Do you think you can sleep?” Frolin asked me, when we were alone.I shook my head. “Impossible. I’ll stay up.”“I don’t think he’d like us to stay downstairs,” said Frolin, a faint frown onhis forehead.“In my room, then,” I replied. “And you?”“With you, if you don’t mind. He means to see it through, and there’s nothing wecan do until he needs us. He may call.…”I had the uncomfortable conviction that if my grandfather called for us, itwould be too late, but I forbore to give voice to my fears.The events of that evening started as before—with the strains of that weirdlybeautiful music welling flute-like from the darkness around the house. Then, ina little while, came the wind, and the cold, and the ululating voice. And then,preceded by an aura of evil so great that it was almost stifling in theroom—then came something more, something unspeakably terrible. We had beensitting, Frolin and I, with the light out; I had not bothered to light myelectric candle, since no light we could show would illumine the source of thesemanifestations. I faced the window and, when the wind began to rise, looked onceagain to the line of trees, thinking that surely, certainly, they must bendbefore this great onrushing storm of wind; but again there was nothing, nomovement in that stillness. And there was no cloud in the heavens; the starsshone brightly, the constellations of summer moving down to the western rim ofearth to make the signature of autumn in the sky. The wind’s sound had risensteadily, so that now it had the fury of a gale, and yet nothing, no movement,disturbed the line of trees dark upon the night sky.But suddenly—so suddenly that for a moment I blinked my eyes in an effort toconvince myself that a dream had shuttered my sight—in one large area of the skythe stars were gone! I came to my feet and pressed my face to the pane. It wasas if a cloud had abruptly reared up into the heavens, to a height almost at thezenith; but no cloud could have come upon the sky so swiftly. On both sides andoverhead stars still shone. I opened the window and leaned out, trying to followthe dark outline against the stars. It was the outline of some great beast, ahorrible caricature of man, rising to a semblance of a head high in the heavens,and there, where its eyes might have been, glowed with a deep carmine fire twostars!—Or were they stars? At the same instant, the sound of those approachingfootsteps grew so loud that the house shook and trembled with their vibrations,and the wind’s demoniac fury rose to indescribable heights, and the ululationreached such a pitch that it was maddening to hear.“Frolin!” I called hoarsely.I heard him come to my side, and in a moment felt his tight grasp on my arm. Sohe, too, had seen; it was not hallucination, not dream—this giant thing outlinedagainst the stars, and moving!“It’s moving,” whispered Frolin. “Oh, God!—it’s coming!”He pulled frantically away from the window, and so did I. But in an instant, theshadow on the sky was gone, the stars shone once more. The wind, however, hadnot decreased in intensity one iota; indeed, if it were possible, it grewmomentarily wilder and more violent; the entire house shuddered and quaked,while those thunderous footsteps echoed and re-echoed in the valley before thehouse. And the cold grew worse, so that breath hung a white vapor in air—a coldas of outer space.Out of all the turmoil of mind, I thought of the legend in my grandfather’spapers—the legend of Ithaqua, whose signature lay in the cold and snow of farnorthern places. Even as I remembered, everything was driven from my mind by afrightful chorus of ululation, the triumphant chanting as of a thousand bestialmouths—“Iä! Iä! Ithaqua, Ithaqua! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ithaqua cf’ayak vulgtmm vugtlaglnvulgtmm. Ithaqua fhtagn! Ugh! Iä! Iä! Ai! Ai! Ai!”Simultaneously came a thunderous crash, and immediately after, the voice of mygrandfather, raised in a terrible cry, a cry that rose into a scream of mortalterror, so that the names he would have uttered—Frolin’s and mine—were lost,choked back into his throat by the full force of the horror revealed to him.And, as abruptly as his voice ceased to sound, all other manifestations came toa stop, leaving again that ghastly, portentous silence to close around us like acloud of doom.Frolin reached the door of my room before I did, but I was not far behind. Hefell part of the way down the stairs, but recovered in the light of my electriccandle, which I had seized on my way out, and together we assaulted the door ofthe study, calling to the old man inside.But no voice answered, though the line of yellow under the door was evidencethat his lamp burned still.The door had been locked from the inside, so that it was necessary to break itdown before we could enter.Of my grandfather, there was no trace. But in the east wall yawned a greatcavity, where the painting, now prone upon the floor, had been—a rocky openingleading into the depths of earth—and over everything in the room lay the mark ofIthaqua—a fine carpet of snow, whose crystals gleamed as from a million tinyjewels in the yellow light of grandfather’s lamp. Save for the painting, onlythe bed was disturbed—as if grandfather had been literally torn out of it bystupendous force!I looked hurriedly to where the old man had kept Uncle Leander’s manuscript—butit was gone; nothing of it remained. Frolin cried out suddenly and pointed tothe painting Uncle Leander had made, and then to the opening yawning before us.“It was here all the time—the threshold,” he said.And I saw even as he; as grandfather had seen too late—for the painting by UncleLeander was but the representation of the site of his home before the house hadbeen erected to conceal that cavernous opening into the earth on the hillside,the hidden threshold against which Leander’s manuscript had warned, thethreshold beyond which my grandfather had vanished!Though there is little more to tell, yet the most damning of all the curiousfacts remain to be revealed. A thorough search of the cavern was subsequentlymade by county officials and certain intrepid adventurers from Harmon; it wasfound to have several openings, and it was plain that anyone or anything wishingto reach the house through the cavern would have had to enter through one of theinnumerable hidden crevices discovered among the surrounding hills. The natureof Uncle Leander’s activities was revealed after grandfather’s disappearance.Frolin and I were put through a hard grilling by suspicious county officials,but were finally released when the body of my grandfather did not come to light.But since that night, certain facts came into the open, facts which, in thelight of my grandfather’s hints, coupled with the horrible legends contained inthe shunned books locked away here in the library of Miskatonic University, aredamning and damnably inescapable.The first of them was the series of gigantic footprints found in the earth atthe place where on that fatal night the shadow had risen into the star-sweptheavens—the unbelievable wide and deep depressions, as of some prehistoricmonster walking there, steps a half mile apart, steps that led beyond the houseand vanished at a crevice leading down into that hidden cavern in tracksidentical with those found in the snow in northern Manitoba where thoseunfortunate travelers and the constable sent to find them had vanished from theface of the earth!The second was the discovery of my grandfather’s notebook, together with aportion of Uncle Leander’s manuscript, encased in ice, found deep in the forestsnows of upper Saskatchewan, and bearing every sign of having been dropped froma great height. The last entry was dated on the day of his disappearance in lateSeptember; the notebook was not found until the following April. Neither Frolinnor I dared to make the explanation of its strange appearance which cameimmediately to mind, and together we burned that horrible letter and theimperfect translation grandfather had made, the translation which in itself, asit was written down, with all its warnings against the terror beyond thethreshold, had served to summon from outside a creature so horrible that itsdescription has never been attempted by even those ancient writers whoseterrible narratives are scattered over the face of the earth!And last of all, the most conclusive, the most damning evidence—the discoveryseven months later of my grandfather’s body on a small Pacific island not farsoutheast of Singapore, and the curious report made of his condition: perfectlypreserved, as if in ice, so cold that no one could touch him with bare hands forfive days after his discovery, and the singular fact that he was found halfburied in sand, as if “he had fallen from an aeroplane!” Neither Frolin nor Icould any longer have any doubt; this was the legend of Ithaqua, who carried hisvictims with him into far places of the earth, in time and space, before leavingthem behind. And the evidence was undeniable that my grandfather had been alivefor part of that incredible journey, for if we had had any doubt, the thingsfound in his pockets, the mementos carried from strange hidden places where hehad been, and sent to us, were final and damning testimony—the gold plaque, withits miniature presentation of a struggle between ancient beings, and bearing onits surface inscriptions in cabalistic designs, the plaque which Dr. Rackham ofMiskatonic University identified as having come from some place beyond thememory of man; the loathsome book in Burmese that revealed ghastly legends ofthat shunned and hidden Plateau of Leng, the place of the dread Tcho-Tchopeople; and finally, the revolting and bestial stone miniature of a hellishmonstrosity walking on the winds above the earth!* Originally published in Weird Tales, September 1941."},{"pageContent":"THE SHAMBLER FROM THE STARS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]ROBERT BLOCH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg](DEDICATED TO H. P. LOVECRAFT)II am what I profess to be—a writer of weird fiction. Since earliest childhood Ihave been enthralled by the cryptic fascination of the unknown and theunguessable. The nameless fears, the grotesque dreams, the queer, half-intuitivefancies that haunt our minds, have always exercised for me a potent andinexplicable delight.In literature I have walked the midnight paths with Poe or crept amidst theshadows with Machen; combed the realms of horrific stars with Baudelaire, orsteeped myself with earth’s inner madness amidst the tales of ancient lore. Ameager talent for sketching and crayon work led me to attempt crudepicturizations involving the outlandish denizens of my nighted thoughts. Thesame somber trend of intellect which drew me in my art interested me in obscurerealms of musical composition; the symphonic strains of the Planets Suite andthe like were my favorites. My inner life soon became a ghoulish feast ofeldritch, tantalizing horrors.My outer existence was comparatively dull. As time went on I found myselfdrifting more and more into the life of a penurious recluse; a tranquil,philosophical existence amidst a world of books and dreams.A man must live. By nature constitutionally and spiritually unfitted for manuallabor, I was at first puzzled about the choice of a suitable vocation. Thedepression complicated matters to an almost intolerable degree, and for a time Iwas close to utter economic disaster. It was then that I decided to write.I procured a battered typewriter, a ream of cheap paper, and a few carbons. Mysubject matter did not bother me. What better field than the boundless realms ofa colorful imagination? I would write of horror, fear, and the riddle that isDeath. At least, in the callowness of my unsophistication, this was myintention.My first attempts soon convinced me how utterly I had failed. Sadly, miserably,I fell short of my aspired goal. My vivid dreams became on paper merelymeaningless jumbles of ponderous adjectives, and I found no ordinary words toexpress the wondrous terror of the unknown. My first manuscripts were miserableand futile documents; the few magazines using such material being unanimous intheir rejections.I had to live. Slowly but surely I began to adjust my style to my ideas.Laboriously I experimented with words, phrases, sentence-structure. It was work,and hard work at that. I soon learned to sweat. At last, however, one of mystories met with favor; then a second, a third, a fourth. Soon I had begun tomaster the more obvious tricks of the trade, and the future looked brighter atlast. It was with an easier mind that I returned to my dream-life and my belovedbooks. My stories afforded me a somewhat meager livelihood, and for a time thissufficed. But not for long. Ambition, ever an illusion, was the cause of myundoing.I wanted to write a real story; not the stereotyped, ephemeral sort of tale Iturned out for the magazines, but a real work of art. The creation of such amasterpiece became my ideal. I was not a good writer, but that was not entirelydue to my errors in mechanical style. It was, I felt, the fault of my subjectmatter. Vampires, werewolves, ghouls, mythological monsters—these thingsconstituted material of little merit. Commonplace imagery, ordinary adjectivaltreatment, and a prosaically anthropocentric point of view were the chiefdetriments to the production of a really good weird tale.I must have new subject matter, truly unusual plot material. If only I couldconceive of something that was teratologically incredible!I longed to learn the songs the demons sing as they swoop between the stars, orhear the voices of the olden gods as they whisper their secrets to the echoingvoid. I yearned to know the terrors of the grave; the kiss of maggots on mytongue, the cold caress of a rotting shroud upon my body. I thirsted for theknowledge that lies in the pits of mummied eyes, and burned for wisdom knownonly to the worm. Then I could really write, and my hopes be truly realized.I sought a way. Quietly I began a correspondence with isolated thinkers anddreamers all over the country. There was a hermit in the western hills, a savantin the northern wilds, a mystic dreamer in New England. It was from the latterthat I learned of the ancient books that hold strange lore. He quoted guardedlyfrom the legendary Necronomicon, and spoke timidly of a certain Book of Eibonthat was reputed to surpass it in the utter wildness of its blasphemy. Hehimself had been a student of these volumes of primal dread, but he did not wantme to search too far. He had heard many strange things as a boy in witch-hauntedArkham, where the old shadows still leer and creep, and since then he had wiselyshunned the blacker knowledge of the forbidden.At length, after much pressing on my part, he reluctantly consented to furnishme with the names of certain persons he deemed able to aid me in my quest. Hewas a writer of notable brilliance and wide reputation among the discriminatingfew, and I knew he was keenly interested in the outcome of the whole affair.As soon as his precious list came into my possession, I began a widespreadpostal campaign in order to obtain access to the desired volumes. My letterswent out to universities, private libraries, reputed seers, and the leaders ofcarefully hidden and obscurely designated cults. But I was foredoomed todisappointment.The replies I received were definitely unfriendly, almost hostile. Evidently therumored possessors of such lore were angered that their secret should be thusunveiled by a prying stranger. I was subsequently the recipient of severalanonymous threats through the mails, and I had one very alarming phone-call.This did not bother me nearly so much as the disappointing realization that myendeavors had failed. Denials, evasions, refusals, threats—these would not aidme. I must look elsewhere.The bookstores! Perhaps on some musty and forgotten shelf I might discover whatI sought.Then I began an interminable crusade. I learned to bear my numerousdisappointments with unflinching calm. Nobody in the common run of shops seemedever to have heard of the frightful Necronomicon, the evil Book of Eibon, or thedisquieting Cultes des Goules.Persistence brings results. In a little old shop on South Dearborn Street,amidst dusty shelves seemingly forgotten by time, I came to the end of mysearch. There, securely wedged between two century-old editions of Shakespeare,stood a great black volume with iron facings. Upon it, in hand-engravedlettering, was the inscription De Vermis Mysteriis, or “Mysteries of the Worm.”The proprietor could not tell how it had come into his possession. Years before,perhaps, it had been included in some secondhand job-lot. He was obviouslyunaware of its nature, for I purchased it with a dollar bill. He wrapped theponderous thing for me, well pleased at this unexpected sale, and bade me a verysatisfied good-day.I left hurriedly, the precious prize under my arm. What a find! I had heard ofthis book before. Ludvig Prinn was its author; who had perished at theinquisitorial stake in Brussels when the witchcraft trials were at their height.A strange character—alchemist, necromancer, reputed mage—he boasted of havingattained a miraculous age when he at last suffered a fiery immolation at thehands of the secular arm. He was said to have proclaimed himself the solesurvivor of the ill-fated Ninth Crusade, exhibiting as proof certain mustydocuments of attestation. It is true that a certain Ludvig Prinn was numberedamong the gentlemen retainers of Montserrat in the olden chronicles, but theincredulous branded Ludvig as a crack-brained imposter, though perchance alineal descendant of the original warrior.Ludvig attributed his sorcerous learning to the years he had spent as a captiveamong the wizards and wonder-workers of Syria, and glibly he spoke of encounterswith the djinns and efreets of elder Eastern myth. He is known to have spentsome time in Egypt, and there are legends among the Libyan dervishes concerningthe old seer’s deeds in Alexandria.At any rate, his declining days were spent in the Flemish lowland country of hisbirth, where he resided, appropriately enough, in the ruins of a pre-Roman tombthat stood in the forest near Brussels. Ludvig was reputed to have dwelt thereamidst a swarm of familiars and fearsomely invoked conjurations. Manuscriptsstill extant speak of him guardedly as being attended by “invisible companions”and “Starsent servants.” Peasants shunned the forest by night, for they did notlike certain noises that resounded to the moon, and they most certainly were notanxious to see what worshipped at the old pagan altars that stood crumbling incertain of the darker glens.Be that as it may, these creatures that he commanded were never seen afterPrinn’s capture by the inquisitorial minions. Searching soldiers found the tombentirely deserted, though it was thoroughly ransacked before its destruction.The supernatural entities, the unusual instruments and compounds—all had mostcuriously vanished. A search of the forbidding woods and a timorous examinationof the strange altars did not add to the information. There were freshblood-stains on the altars, and fresh blood-stains on the rack, too, before thequestioning of Prinn was finished. A series of particularly atrocious torturesfailed to elicit any further disclosures from the silent wizard, and at lengththe weary interrogators ceased, and cast the aged sorcerer into a dungeon.It was in prison, while awaiting trial, that he penned the morbid,horror-hinting lines of De Vermis Mysteriis, known today as Mysteries of theWorm. How it was ever smuggled through the alert guards is a mystery in itself,but a year after his death it saw print in Cologne. It was immediatelysuppressed, but a few copies had already been privately distributed. These inturn were transcribed, and although there was a later censored and deletedprinting, only the Latin original is accepted as genuine. Throughout thecenturies a few of the elect have read and pondered on its lore. The secrets ofthe old archimage are known today only to the initiated, and they discourage allattempts to spread their fame, for certain very definite reasons.This, in brief, was what I knew of the volume’s history at the time it came intomy possession. As a collector’s item alone the book was a phenomenal find, buton its contents I could pass no judgment. It was in Latin. Since I can speak ortranslate only a few words of that learned tongue, I was confronted by a barrieras soon as I opened the musty pages. It was maddening to have such atreasure-trove of dark knowledge at my command and yet lack the key to itsunearthing.For a moment I despaired, since I was unwilling to approach any local classicalor Latin scholar in connection with so hideous and blasphemous a text. Then camean inspiration. Why not take it east and seek the aid of my friend? He was astudent of the classics, and would be less likely to be shocked by the horrorsof Prinn’s baleful revelations. Accordingly I addressed a hasty letter to him,and shortly thereafter received my reply. He would be glad to assist me—I mustby all means come at once.IIProvidence is a lovely town. My friend’s house was ancient, and quaintlyGeorgian. The first floor was a gem of colonial atmosphere. The second, beneathantique gables that shadowed the enormous window, served as a workroom for myhost.It was here that we pondered that grim, eventful night last April; here besidethe open window that overlooked the azure sea. It was a moonless night; haggardand wan with a fog that filled the darkness with bat-like shadows. In my mind’seye I can see it still—the tiny, lamp-lit room with the big table and thehigh-backed chairs; the bookcases bordering the walls; the manuscripts stackedin special files.My friend and I sat at the table, the volume of mystery before us. His leanprofile threw a disturbing shadow on the wall, and his waxen face was furtive inthe pale light. There was an inexplicable air of portentous revelation quitedisturbing in its potency; I sensed the presence of secrets waiting to berevealed.My companion detected it, too. Long years of occult experience had sharpened hisintuition to an uncanny degree. It was not cold that made him tremble as he satthere in his chair; it was not fever that caused his eyes to flame likejewel-incarned fires. He knew, even before he opened that accursed tome, that itwas evil. The musty scent that rose from those antique pages carried with it thereek of the tomb. The faded leaves were maggoty at the edges, and rats hadgnawed the leather; rats which perchance had a ghastlier food for common fare.I had told my friend the volume’s history that afternoon, and had unwrapped itin his presence. Then he had seemed willing and eager to begin an immediatetranslation. Now he demurred.It was not wise, he insisted. This was evil knowledge—who could say whatdemon-dreaded lore these pages might contain, or what ills befall the ignorantone who sought to tamper with their contents? It is not good to learn too much,and men had died for exercising the rotted wisdom that these leaves contained.He begged me to abandon the quest while the book was still unopened and to seekmy inspiration in saner things.I was a fool. Hastily I overruled his objections with vain and empty words. Iwas not afraid. Let us at least gaze into the contents of our prize. I began toturn the pages.The result was disappointing. It was an ordinary-looking volume afterall—yellow, crumbling leaves set with heavy black-lettered Latin texts. That wasall; no illustrations, no alarming designs.My friend could no longer resist the allurement of such a rare bibliophilictreat. In a moment he was peering intently over my shoulder, occasionallymuttering snatches of Latin phrasing. Enthusiasm mastered him at last. Seizingthe precious tome in both hands, he seated himself near the window and beganreading paragraphs at random, occasionally translating them into English.His eyes gleamed with a feral light; his cadaverous profile grew intent as hepored over the moldering runes. Sentences thundered in fearsome litany, thenfaded into tones below a whisper as his voice became as soft as a viper’s hiss.I caught only a few phrases now, for in his introspection he seemed to haveforgotten me. He was reading of spells and enchantments. I recall allusions tosuch gods of divination as Father Yig, dark Han, and serpent-bearded Byatis. Ishuddered, for I knew these names of old, but I would have shuddered more had Iknown what was yet to come.It came quickly. Suddenly he turned to me in great agitation, and his excitedvoice was shrill. He asked me if I remembered the legends of Prinn’s sorcery,and the tales of the invisible servants he commanded from the stars. I assented,little understanding the cause of his sudden frenzy.Then he told me the reason. Here, under a chapter on familiars, he had found anorison or spell, perhaps the very one Prinn had used to call upon his unseenservitors from beyond the stars! Let me listen while he read.* * *I sat there dully, like a stupid, uncomprehending fool. Why did I not scream,try to escape, or tear that monstrous manuscript from his hands? Instead I satthere—sat there while my friend, in a voice cracked with unnatural excitement,read in Latin a long and sonorously sinister invocation.“Tibi, Magnum Innominandum, signa stellarum nigrarum et bufoniformis Sadoquaesigillum.…”The croaking ritual proceeded, then rose on wings of nighted, hideous horror.The words seemed to writhe like flames in the air, burning into my brain. Thethundering tones cast an echo into infinity, beyond the farthermost star. Theyseemed to pass into primal and undimensioned gates, to seek out a listenerthere, and summon him to earth. Was it all an illusion? I did not pause toponder.For that unwitting summons was answered. Scarcely had my companion’s voice diedaway in that little room before the terror came. The room turned cold. A suddenwind shrieked in through the open window; a wind that was not of earth. It borean evil bleating from afar, and at the sound, my friend’s face became a palewhite mask of newly awakened fear. Then there was a crunching at the walls, andthe window-ledge buckled before my staring eyes. From out of the nothingnessbeyond that opening came a sudden burst of lubricious laughter—a hystericalcackling born of utter madness. It rose to the grinning quintessence of allhorror, without mouth to give it birth.The rest happened with startling swiftness. All at once my friend began toscream as he stood by the window; scream and claw wildly at empty air. In thelamplight I saw his features contort into a grimace of insane agony. A momentlater, his body rose unsupported from the floor, and began to bend outward to abackbreaking degree. A second later came the sickening grind of broken bones.His form now hung in midair, the eyes glazed and the hands clutchingconvulsively as if at something unseen. Once again there came the sound ofmaniacal tittering, but this time it came from within the room!The stars rocked in red anguish; the cold wind gibbered in my ears. I crouchedin my chair, my eyes riveted on that astounding scene in the corner.My friend was shrieking now; his screams blended with that gleeful, atrociouslaughter from the empty air. His sagging body, dangling in space, bent backwardonce again as blood spurted from the torn neck, spraying like a ruby fountain.That blood never reached the floor. It stopped in midair as the laughter ceased,and a loathsome sucking noise took its place. With a new and accelerated horror,I realized that that blood was being drained to feed the invisible entity frombeyond! What creature of space had been so suddenly and unwittingly invoked?What was that vampiric monstrosity I could not see?Even now a hideous metamorphosis was taking place. The body of my companionbecame shrunken, wizened, lifeless. At length it dropped to the floor and laynauseatingly still. But in midair another and a ghastlier change occurred.A reddish glow filled the corner by the window—a bloody glow. Slowly but surelythe dim outlines of a Presence came into view; the blood-filled outlines of thatunseen shambler from the stars. It was red and dripping; an immensity ofpulsing, moving jelly; a scarlet blob with myriad tentacular trunks that wavedand waved. There were suckers on the tips of the appendages, and these wereopening and closing with a ghoulish lust.… The thing was bloated and obscene; aheadless, faceless, eyeless bulk with the ravenous maw and titanic talons of astar-born monster. The human blood on which it had fed revealed the hithertoinvisible outlines of the feaster. It was not a sight for sane eyes to see.Fortunately for my reason, the creature did not linger. Spurning the dead andflabby corpse-like thing on the floor, it purposely seized the opening. There itdisappeared, and I heard its far-off, derisive laughter floating on the wings ofthe wind as it receded into the gulfs from whence it had come.That was all. I was left alone in the room with the limp and lifeless body at myfeet. The book was gone; but there were bloody prints upon the wall, bloodyswaths upon the floor, and the face of my poor friend was a bloody death’s-head,leering up at the stars.For a long time I sat alone in silence before I set to fire that room and all itcontained. After that I went away, laughing, for I knew that the blaze woulderadicate all trace of what remained. I had arrived only that afternoon, andthere was none who knew, and none to see me go, for I departed ere the glowingflames were detected. I stumbled for hours through the twisted streets, andquaked with renewed and idiotic laughter as I looked up at the burning,ever-gloating stars that eyed me furtively through wreaths of haunted fog.After a long while I became calm enough to board a train. I have been calmthroughout the long journey home, and calm throughout the penning of thisscreed. I was even calm when I read of my friend’s curious accidental death inthe fire that destroyed his dwelling.It is only at nights, when the stars gleam, that dreams return to drive me intoa gigantic maze of frantic fears. Then I take to drugs, in a vain attempt to banthose leering memories from my sleep. But I really do not care, for I shall notbe here long.I have a curious suspicion that I shall again see that shambler from the stars.I think it will return soon without being resummoned, and I know that when itcomes it will seek me out and carry me down into the darkness that holds myfriend. Sometimes I almost yearn for the advent of that day, for then I shalllearn once and for all, the Mysteries of the Worm.* Originally published in Weird Tales, September 1935."},{"pageContent":"THE HAUNTER OF THE DARK*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]H.

It is true that the window he faced was unbroken, butNature has shewn herself capable of many freakish performances. The expressionon his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelatedto anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of afantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain oldmatters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted churchon Federal Hill—the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to somecharlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake wassecretly connected.For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the fieldof myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes andeffects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the city—a visit to astrange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as he—had endedamidst death and flame, and it must have been some morbid instinct which drewhim back from his home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old storiesdespite his statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may havenipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection.Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, thereremain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They areinclined to take much of Blake’s diary at its face value, and pointsignificantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the oldchurch record, the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox StarryWisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporternamed Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, and—above all—the look of monstrous,transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died. It was one ofthese believers who, moved to fanatical extremes, threw into the bay thecuriously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box found in the oldchurch steeple—the black windowless steeple, and not the tower where Blake’sdiary said those things originally were. Though widely censured both officiallyand unofficially, this man—a reputable physician with a taste for oddfolklore—averred that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to restupon it.Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself. Thepapers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle, leaving forothers the drawing of the picture as Robert Blake saw it—or thought he saw it—orpretended to see it. Now, studying the diary closely, dispassionately, and atleisure, let us summarise the dark chain of events from the expressed point ofview of their chief actor.Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934–5, taking the upperfloor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street—on the crestof the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus and behind themarble John Hay Library. It was a cosy and fascinating place, in a little gardenoasis of village-like antiquity where huge, friendly cats sunned themselves atopa convenient shed. The square Georgian house had a monitor roof, classic doorwaywith fan carving, small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks ofearly-nineteenth-century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors, widefloor-boards, a curving colonial staircase, white Adam-period mantels, and arear set of rooms three steps below the general level.Blake’s study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden on oneside, while its west windows—before one of which he had his desk—faced off fromthe brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower town’s outspreadroofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them. On the far horizonwere the open countryside’s purple slopes. Against these, some two miles away,rose the spectral hump of Federal Hill, bristling with huddled roofs andsteeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms asthe smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious sensethat he was looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might or might notvanish as in a dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person.Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique furnituresuitable to his quarters and settled down to write and paint—living alone, andattending to the simple housework himself. His studio was in a north attic room,where the panes of the monitor roof furnished admirable lighting. During thatfirst winter he produced five of his best-known short stories—“The BurrowerBeneath,” “The Stairs in the Crypt,” “Shaggai,” “In the Vale of Pnath,” and “TheFeaster from the Stars”—and painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhumanmonsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspreadwest—the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below, the Georgian court-housebelfry, the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section, and that shimmering,spire-crowned mound in the distance whose unknown streets and labyrinthinegables so potently provoked his fancy. From his few local acquaintances helearned that the far-off slope was a vast Italian quarter, though most of thehouses were remnants of older Yankee and Irish days. Now and then he would trainhis field-glasses on that spectral, unreachable world beyond the curling smoke;picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples, and speculating upon thebizarre and curious mysteries they might house. Even with optical aid FederalHill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous, and linked to the unreal, intangiblemarvels of Blake’s own tales and pictures. The feeling would persist long afterthe hill had faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-housefloodlights and the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the nightgrotesque.Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church mostfascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours ofthe day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blacklyagainst the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on especially high ground; for thegrimy facade, and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the topsof great pointed windows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepolesand chimneypots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of stone,stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more. Thestyle, so far as the glass could shew, was that earliest experimental form ofGothic revival which preceded the stately Upjohn period and held over some ofthe outlines and proportions of the Georgian age. Perhaps it was reared around1810 or 1815.As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an oddlymounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he knew that itmust be vacant. The longer he watched, the more his imagination worked, till atlength he began to fancy curious things. He believed that a vague, singular auraof desolation hovered over the place, so that even the pigeons and swallowsshunned its smoky eaves. Around other towers and belfries his glass would revealgreat flocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what hethought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends,but none of them had ever been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notionof what the church was or had been.In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his long-plannednovel—based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in Maine—but was strangelyunable to make progress with it. More and more he would sit at his westwardwindow and gaze at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned bythe birds. When the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world wasfilled with a new beauty, but Blake’s restlessness was merely increased. It wasthen that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up thatfabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made hisfirst trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown streets andthe bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue ofcentury-worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he feltmust lead up to the long-known, unreachable world beyond the mists. There weredingy blue-and-white street signs which meant nothing to him, and presently henoted the strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs overcurious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he find any ofthe objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied that theFederal Hill of that distant view was a dream-world never to be trod by livinghuman feet.Now and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight, butnever the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper about agreat stone church the man smiled and shook his head, though he spoke Englishfreely. As Blake climbed higher, the region seemed stranger and stranger, withbewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south.He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiartower. Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and thistime he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man’sface had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curioussign with his right hand.Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, abovethe tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake knew at oncewhat it was, and plunged toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes thatclimbed from the avenue. Twice he lost his way, but he somehow dared not ask anyof the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps, or any of thechildren who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes.At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone bulk rosedarkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in a windswept open square,quaintly cobblestoned, with a high bank wall on the farther side. This was theend of his quest; for upon the wide, iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which thewall supported—a separate, lesser world raised fully six feet above thesurrounding streets—there stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despiteBlake’s new perspective, was beyond dispute.The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high stonebuttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost among thebrown, neglected weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows were largelyunbroken, though many of the stone mullions were missing. Blake wondered how theobscurely painted panes could have survived so well, in view of the known habitsof small boys the world over. The massive doors were intact and tightly closed.Around the top of the bank wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty ironfence whose gate—at the head of a flight of steps from the square—was visiblypadlocked. The path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown.Desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place, and in the birdless eavesand black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond hispower to define.There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at thenortherly end and approached him with questions about the church. He was a greatwholesome Irishman, and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make thesign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that building. WhenBlake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the Italian priests warnedeverybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and leftits mark. He himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father, who recalledcertain sounds and rumours from his boyhood.There had been a bad sect there in the old days—an outlaw sect that called upawful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a good priest toexorcise what had come, though there did be those who said that merely the lightcould do it. If Father O’Malley were alive there would be many the thing hecould tell. But now there was nothing to do but let it alone. It hurt nobodynow, and those that owned it were dead or far away. They had run away like ratsafter the threatening talk in ’77, when people began to mind the way folksvanished now and then in the neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in andtake the property for lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody’stouching it. Better it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things bestirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss.After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile. Itexcited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him,and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoathad repeated. Probably they were mere legends evoked by the evil look of theplace, but even so, they were like a strange coming to life of one of his ownstories.The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed unable tolight up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its highplateau. It was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown, witheredgrowths in the raised, iron-fenced yard. Blake found himself edging nearer theraised area and examining the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues ofingress. There was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to beresisted. The fence had no opening near the steps, but around on the north sidewere some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk around on the narrowcoping outside the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the placeso wildly, he would encounter no interference.He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him.Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away and makingthe same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made.Several windows were slammed down, and a fat woman darted into the street andpulled some small children inside a rickety, unpainted house. The gap in thefence was very easy to pass through, and before long Blake found himself wadingamidst the rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here and there theworn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in thisfield; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer bulk of thechurch was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood andapproached to try the three great doors in the facade. All were securely locked,so he began a circuit of the Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and morepenetrable opening. Even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter thathaunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him onautomatically.A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the neededaperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintlylitten by the western sun’s filtered rays. Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxesand furniture of numerous sorts met his eye, though over everything lay a shroudof dust which softened all sharp outlines. The rusted remains of a hot-airfurnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late asmid-Victorian times.Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window andlet himself down to the dust-carpeted and debrisstrown concrete floor. Thevaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to theright, amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs. Hefelt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectralbuilding, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about—finding astill-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window toprovide for his exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide,cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half choked with the omnipresent dust,and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached and began to climb the wornstone steps which rose into the darkness. He had no light, but groped carefullywith his hands. After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a littlefumbling revealed its ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw adimly illumined corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling.Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All theinner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room. Thecolossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dustover box pews, altar, hourglass pulpit, and sounding-board, and its titanicropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwiningthe clustered Gothic columns. Over all this hushed desolation played a hideousleaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange,half-blackened panes of the great apsidal windows.The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake couldscarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little he could makeout he did not like them. The designs were largely conventional, and hisknowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancientpatterns. The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism,while one of the windows seemed to shew merely a dark space with spirals ofcurious luminosity scattered about in it. Turning away from the windows, Blakenoticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind,but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy Egypt.In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk andceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first timehe received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those bookstold him much. They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people havenever even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; thebanned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulaewhich have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man’s youth, andthe dim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them—a Latinversion of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamousCultes des Goules of Comte d’Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt,and old Ludvig Prinn’s hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he hadknown merely by reputation or not at all—the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book ofDzyan, and a crumbling volume in wholly unidentifiable characters yet withcertain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult student.Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once been theseat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe.In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries insome odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the commontraditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology,and other dubious arts—the devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, andzodiacal signs—here massed in solid pages of text, with divisions andparagraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter.In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in hiscoat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably,and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time. He wondered how theycould have remained undisturbed so long. Was he the first to conquer theclutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected thisdeserted place from visitors?Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again throughthe dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a doorand staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple—objectsso long familiar to him at a distance. The ascent was a choking experience, fordust lay thick, while the spiders had done their worst in this constrictedplace. The staircase was a spiral with high, narrow wooden treads, and now andthen Blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city. Though hehad seen no ropes below, he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in thetower whose narrow, louver-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied sooften. Here he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of thestairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted tovastly different purposes.The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet windows,one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of decayinglouver-boards. These had been further fitted with tight, opaque screens, but thelatter were now largely rotted away. In the centre of the dust-laden floor rosea curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in averagediameter, covered on each side with bizarre, crudely incised, and whollyunrecognisable hieroglyphs. On this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarlyasymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown back, and its interior holding whatlooked beneath the decade-deep dust to be an egg-shaped or irregularly sphericalobject some four inches through. Around the pillar in a rough circle were sevenhigh-backed Gothic chairs still largely intact, while behind them, ranging alongthe dark-panelled walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, black-paintedplaster, resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths ofmysterious Easter Island. In one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder wasbuilt into the wall, leading up to the closed trap-door of the windowlesssteeple above.As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on thestrange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to clear the dustaway with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings were of amonstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which, though seeminglyalive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this planet. The four-inchseeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black, red-striated polyhedron withmany irregular flat surfaces; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort, oran artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter. It did nottouch the bottom of the box, but was held suspended by means of a metal bandaround its centre, with seven queerly designed supports extending horizontallyto angles of the box’s inner wall near the top. This stone, once exposed,exerted upon Blake an almost alarming fascination. He could scarcely tear hiseyes from it, and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied itwas transparent, with half-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind floatedpictures of alien orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs with titanmountains and no mark of life, and still remoter spaces where only a stirring invague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will.When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in thefar corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took his attention hecould not tell, but something in its contours carried a message to hisunconscious mind. Ploughing toward it, and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs ashe went, he began to discern something grim about it. Hand and handkerchief soonrevealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions. It wasa human skeleton, and it must have been there for a very long time. The clothingwas in shreds, but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man’s greysuit. There were other bits of evidence—shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons forround cuffs, a stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter’s badge with the name ofthe old Providence Telegram, and a crumbling leather pocketbook. Blake examinedthe latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue, acelluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name “Edwin M.Lillibridge,” and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at thedim westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases as the following:“Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844—buys old Free-Will Church inJuly—his archaeological work & studies in occult well known.”“Dr. Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon Dec. 29, 1844.”“Congregation 97 by end of ’45.”“1846—3 disappearances—first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.”“7 disappearances 1848—stories of blood sacrifice begin.”“Investigation 1853 comes to nothing—stories of sounds.”“Fr. O’Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian ruins—saysthey call up something that can’t exist in light. Flees a little light, andbanished by strong light. Then has to be summoned again. Probably got this fromdeathbed confession of Francis X. Feeney, who had joined Starry Wisdom in ’49.These people say the Shining Trapezohedron shews them heaven & other worlds, &that the Haunter of the Dark tells them secrets in some way.”“Story of Orrin B. Eddy 1857. They call it up by gazing at the crystal, & have asecret language of their own.”“200 or more in cong. 1863, exclusive of men at front.”“Irish boys mob church in 1869 after Patrick Regan’s disappearance.”“Veiled article in J. March 14, ’72, but people don’t talk about it.”“6 disappearances 1876—secret committee calls on Mayor Doyle.”“Action promised Feb. 1877—church closes in April.”“Gang—Federal Hill Boys—threaten Dr. —— and vestrymen in May.”“181 persons leave city before end of ’77—mention no names.”“Ghost stories begin around 1880—try to ascertain truth of report that no humanbeing has entered church since 1877.”“Ask Lanigan for photograph of place taken 1851.” …Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat, Blaketurned to look down at the skeleton in the dust. The implications of the noteswere clear, and there could be no doubt but that this man had come to thedeserted edifice forty-two years before in quest of a newspaper sensation whichno one else had been bold enough to attempt. Perhaps no one else had known ofhis plan—who could tell? But he had never returned to his paper. Had somebravely suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heart-failure?Blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state. Some ofthem were badly scattered, and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends. Otherswere strangely yellowed, with vague suggestions of charring. This charringextended to some of the fragments of clothing. The skull was in a very peculiarstate—stained yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerfulacid had eaten through the solid bone. What had happened to the skeleton duringits four decades of silent entombment here Blake could not imagine.Before he realised it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting itscurious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw processionsof robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and looked on endlessleagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching monoliths. He saw towers andwalls in nighted depths under the sea, and vortices of space where wisps ofblack mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond allelse he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semi-solid formswere known only by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed tosuperimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcanaof the worlds we know.Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing, indeterminatepanic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone, conscious of someformless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness.He felt entangled with something—something which was not in the stone, but whichhad looked through it at him—something which would ceaselessly follow him with acognition that was not physical sight. Plainly, the place was getting on hisnerves—as well it might in view of his gruesome find. The light was waning, too,and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leavingsoon.It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint trace ofluminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried to look away from it, butsome obscure compulsion drew his eyes back. Was there a subtle phosphorescenceof radio-activity about the thing? What was it that the dead man’s notes hadsaid concerning a Shining Trapezohedron? What, anyway, was this abandoned lairof cosmic evil? What had been done here, and what might still be lurking in thebird-shunned shadows? It seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisensomewhere close by, though its source was not apparent. Blake seized the coverof the long-open box and snapped it down. It moved easily on its alien hinges,and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stone.At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from thesteeple’s eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trapdoor. Rats, withoutquestion—the only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pilesince he had entered it. And yet that stirring in the steeple frightened himhorribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs, across theghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out amidst the gathering dusk of thedeserted square, and down through the teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenuesof Federal Hill toward the sane central streets and the home-like bricksidewalks of the college district.During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition. Instead, heread much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper files downtown, andworked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbedvestry room. The cipher, he soon saw, was no simple one; and after a long periodof endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be English, Latin, Greek,French, Spanish, Italian, or German. Evidently, he would have to draw upon thedeepest wells of his strange erudition.Every evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned, and he saw the blacksteeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and half-fabulousworld. But now it held a fresh note of terror for him. He knew the heritage ofevil lore it masked, and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer newways. The birds of spring were returning, and as he watched their sunset flightshe fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone spire as never before. When a flock ofthem approached it, he thought, they would wheel and scatter in panicconfusion—and he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach himacross the intervening miles.It was in June that Blake’s diary told of his victory over the cryptogram. Thetext was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of evilantiquity, and known to him in a halting way through previous researches. Thediary is strangely reticent about what Blake deciphered, but he was patentlyawed and disconcerted by his results. There are references to a Haunter of theDark awaked by gazing into the Shining Trapezohedron, and insane conjecturesabout the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called. The being is spoken ofas holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake’sentries shew fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalkabroad; though he adds that the street-lights form a bulwark which cannot becrossed.Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all timeand space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on darkYuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth. It was treasured andplaced in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged fromtheir ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuriaby the first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sankwith Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthymerchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a templewith a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken fromall monuments and records. Then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane whichthe priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver’s spade once morebrought it forth to curse mankind.Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake’s entries, though in sobrief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to theircontribution. It appears that a new fear had been growing on Federal Hill sincea stranger had entered the dreaded church. The Italians whispered ofunaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowlesssteeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted theirdreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if itwere dark enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the long-standing localsuperstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of thehorror. It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians. Inwriting of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse,and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing whathe had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the sametime, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits amorbid longing—pervading even his dreams—to visit the accursed tower and gazeagain into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.Then something in the Journal on the morning of July 17 threw the diarist into averitable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other half-humourousitems about the Federal Hill restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow veryterrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm had put the city’s lighting-systemout of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians hadnearly gone mad with fright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn thatthe thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street-lamps’ absence andgone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous,altogether dreadful way. Toward the last it had bumped up to the tower, wherethere were sounds of the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darknessreached, but light would always send it fleeing.When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in thetower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened,louver-boarded windows was too much for the thing. It had bumped and slitheredup into its tenebrous steeple just in time—for a long dose of light would havesent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it. During thedark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lightedcandles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas—a guard oflight to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, thosenearest the church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously.But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of whatthe reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of thescare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled intothe church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain. They foundthe dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singularway, with bits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiouslyaround. There was a bad odour everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellowstain and patches of what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower,and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found thenarrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They spoke of theheptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the bizarre plasterimages; though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeletonwere not mentioned. What disturbed Blake the most—except for the hints of stainsand charring and bad odours—was the final detail that explained the crashingglass. Every one of the tower’s lancet windows was broken, and two of them hadbeen darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pew-liningsand cushion-horsehair into the spaces between the slanting exteriorlouver-boards. More satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scatteredaround the newly swept floor, as if someone had been interrupted in the act ofrestoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained days.Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowlessspire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the horizontally slidingtrap-door, and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetidspace, he saw nothing but darkness, and an heterogeneous litter of shapelessfragments near the aperture. The verdict, of course, was charlatanry. Somebodyhad played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic hadstriven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps someof the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax onthe outside world. There was an amusing aftermath when the police sent anofficer to verify the reports. Three men in succession found ways of evading theassignment, and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned very soon withoutadding to the account given by the reporters.From this point onward Blake’s diary shews a mounting tide of insidious horrorand nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing something, andspeculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown. It hasbeen verified that on three occasions—during thunderstorms—he telephoned theelectric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautionsagainst a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries shew concern overthe failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the strangelymarred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed thatthese things had been removed—whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess.But his worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt toexist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple—thatmonstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate blackspaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and callers of thatperiod remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of thewest window at that far-off, spire-bristling mound beyond the swirling smoke ofthe city. His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of astrengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a nightwhen he awaked to find himself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automaticallydown College Hill toward the west. Again and again he dwells on the fact thatthe thing in the steeple knows where to find him.The week following July 30 is recalled as the time of Blake’s partial breakdown.He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone. Visitors remarked thecords he kept near his bed, and he said that sleep-walking had forced him tobind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else wakenhim with the labour of untying.In his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse.After retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself gropingabout in an almost black space. All he could see were short, faint, horizontalstreaks of bluish light, but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear acurious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him. Whenever he moved he stumbledover something, and at each noise there would come a sort of answering soundfrom above—a vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilstlater he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, andfumbling his uncertain way upward toward some region of intenser stench where ahot, searing blast beat down against him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic rangeof phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into thepicture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds ofan even profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of UltimateChaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things,encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled bythe thin monotonous piping of a daemoniac flute held in nameless paws.Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused himto the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he never knew—perhaps itwas some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on Federal Hill as thedwellers hail their various patron saints, or the saints of their nativevillages in Italy. In any event he shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from theladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightlesschamber that encompassed him.He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiralstaircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a nightmareflight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realmsof leering shadow, a sightless scramble through a littered basement, a climb toregions of air and street-lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hillof gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and up thesteep eastward precipice to his own ancient door.On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his studyfloor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his bodyseemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badlyscorched, while a trace of strange, evil odour seemed to cling to his upperouter clothing. It was then that his nerves broke down. Thereafter, loungingexhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his westwindow, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary.The great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning struckrepeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported.The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder broughtsleeplessness to thousands. Blake was utterly frantic in his fear for thelighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 A.M., though bythat time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety. Herecorded everything in his diary—the large, nervous, and often undecipherablehieroglyphics telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and ofentries scrawled blindly in the dark.He had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window, and it appearsthat most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rainacross the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distantlights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he would fumblingly make an entry inhis diary, so that detached phrases such as “The lights must not go”; “It knowswhere I am”; “I must destroy it”; and “It is calling to me, but perhaps it meansno injury this time”; are found scattered down two of the pages.Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2:12 A.M., accordingto power-house records, but Blake’s diary gives no indication of the time. Theentry is merely, “Lights out—God help me.” On Federal Hill there were watchersas anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleysaround the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oillanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southernItaly. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs of fearwith their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen andfinally to cease altogether. A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so thatthe scene grew threateningly dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of SpiritoSanto Church, and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpfulsyllables he could. Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower,there could be no doubt whatever.For what happened at 2:35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young,intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monahan of theCentral Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at thatpart of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of the seventy-eight men whohad gathered around the church’s high bank wall—especially those in the squarewhere the eastward facade was visible. Of course there was nothing which can beproved as being outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such anevent are many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemicalprocesses arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building ofheterogeneous contents. Mephitic vapours—spontaneous combustion—pressure ofgases born of long decay—any one of numberless phenomena might be responsible.And then, of course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means beexcluded. The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less thanthree minutes of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked athis watch repeatedly.It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the blacktower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odoursfrom the church, and this had now become emphatic and offensive. Then at lastthere was a sound of splintering wood, and a large, heavy object crashed down inthe yard beneath the frowning easterly facade. The tower was invisible now thatthe candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knewthat it was the smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower’s east window.Immediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseenheights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost prostratingthose in the square. At the same time the air trembled with a vibration as offlapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more violent than any previousblast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas of the crowd.Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night, though someupward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denserblackness against the inky sky—something like a formless cloud of smoke thatshot with meteor-like speed toward the east.That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort,and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all. Not knowing whathad happened, they did not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent up aprayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning, followed by an earsplitting crashof sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half an hour later the rain stopped, and infifteen minutes more the street-lights sprang on again, sending the weary,bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes.The next day’s papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with thegeneral storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and deafeningexplosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendousfarther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed. Thephenomenon was most marked over College Hill, where the crash awaked all thesleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations. Of those whowere already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top ofthe hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost strippedthe leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was agreedthat the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere in thisneighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could afterward be found. A youthin the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass ofsmoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation hasnot been verified. All of the few observers, however, agree as to the violentgust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded thebelated stroke; whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after thestroke is equally general.These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connexionwith the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta house, whose upperrear windows looked into Blake’s study, noticed the blurred white face at thewestward window on the morning of the 9th, and wondered what was wrong with theexpression. When they saw the same face in the same position that evening, theyfelt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment. Later theyrang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when theintruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsivefright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay. Shortlyafterward the coroner’s physician made an examination, and despite the unbrokenwindow reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced by electricaldischarge, as the cause of death. The hideous expression he ignored altogether,deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by aperson of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced theselatter qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in theapartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk. Blakehad prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencilwas found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand.The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legibleonly in part. From them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differinggreatly from the materialistic official verdict, but such speculations havelittle chance for belief among the conservative. The case of these imaginativetheorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious Dr. Dexter, whothrew the curious box and angled stone—an object certainly self-luminous as seenin the black windowless steeple where it was found—into the deepest channel ofNarragansett Bay. Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake’s part,aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he haduncovered, form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings.These are the entries—or all that can be made of them.“Lights still out—must be five minutes now. Everything depends on lightning.Yaddith grant it will keep up!… Some influence seems beating through it.… Rainand thunder and wind deafen.… The thing is taking hold of my mind.…“Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before.

The passenger, a tall thin man in his early thirties,entered the cab and sat back, clutching a briefcase. He gave an address onBenefit Street and Hurley started out, shifting both taxi and tongue into highgear.Hurley began what was to be a one-sided conversation by commenting on theafternoon performance of the New York Giants. Unperturbed by his passenger’ssilence, he made a few remarks about the weather—recent, current, and expected.Since he received no reply, the driver then proceeded to discuss a localphenomenon, namely the reported escape, that morning, of two black panthers orleopards from the traveling menagerie of Langer Brothers Circus, currentlyappearing in the city. In response to a direct inquiry as to whether he had seenthe beasts roaming at large, Hurley’s customer shook his head.The driver then made several uncomplimentary remarks about the local policeforce and their inability to capture the beasts. It was his considered opinionthat a given platoon of law enforcement officers would be unable to catch a coldif immured in an ice-box for a year. This witticism failed to amuse hispassenger, and before Hurley could continue his monologue they had arrived atthe Benefit Street address. Eighty-five cents changed hands, passenger andbriefcase left the cab, and Hurley drove away.He could not know it at the time, but he thus became the last man who could orwould testify to seeing his passenger alive.The rest is conjecture, and perhaps that is for the best. Certainly it is easyenough to draw certain conclusions as to what happened that night in the oldhouse on Benefit Street, but the weight of those conclusions is hard to bear.One minor mystery is easy enough to clear up—the peculiar silence and aloofnessof Hurley’s passenger. That passenger, Edmund Fiske, of Chicago, Illinois, wasmeditating upon the fulfillment of fifteen years of questing; the cab-triprepresented the last stage of this long journey, and he was reviewing thecircumstances as he rode.Edmund Fiske’s quest had begun, on August 8, 1935, with the death of his closefriend, Robert Harrison Blake, of Milwaukee.Like Fiske himself at the time, Blake had been a precocious adolescentinterested in fantasy-writing, and as such became a member of the “Lovecraftcircle”—a group of writers maintaining correspondence with one another and withthe late Howard Phillips Lovecraft, of Providence.It was through correspondence that Fiske and Blake had become acquainted; theyvisited back and forth between Milwaukee and Chicago, and their mutualpreoccupation with the weird and the fantastic in literature and art served toform the foundation for the close friendship which existed at the time ofBlake’s unexpected and inexplicable demise.Most of the facts—and certain of the conjectures—in connection with Blake’sdeath have been embodied in Lovecraft’s story, “The Haunter of the Dark,” whichwas published more than a year after the younger writer’s passing.Lovecraft had an excellent opportunity to observe matters, for it was on hissuggestion that young Blake had journeyed to Providence early in 1935, and hadbeen provided with living-quarters on College Street by Lovecraft himself. So itwas both as friend and neighbor that the elder fantasy writer had acted innarrating the singular story of Robert Harrison Blake’s last months.In his story, he tells of Blake’s efforts to begin a novel dealing with asurvival of New England witch-cults, but modestly omits his own part inassisting his friend to secure material. Apparently Blake began work on hisproject and then became enmeshed in a horror greater than any envisioned by hisimagination.For Blake was drawn to investigate the crumbling black pile on Federal Hill—thedeserted ruin of a church that had once housed the worshippers of an esotericcult. Early in spring he paid a visit to the shunned structure and there madecertain discoveries which (in Lovecraft’s opinion) made his death inevitable.Briefly, Blake entered the boarded-up Free-Will Church and stumbled across theskeleton of a reporter from the Providence Telegram, one Edwin M. Lillibridge,who had apparently attempted a similar investigation in 1893. The fact that hisdeath was not explained seemed alarming enough, but more disturbing still wasthe realization that no one had been bold enough to enter the church since thatdate and discover the body.Blake found the reporter’s notebook in his clothing, and its contents afforded apartial revelation.A certain Professor Bowen, of Providence, had traveled widely in Egypt, and in1843, in the course of archaeological investigations of the crypt of Nephren-Ka,had made an unusual find.Nephren-Ka is the “forgotten pharaoh,” whose name has been cursed by the priestsand obliterated from official dynastic records. The name was familiar to theyoung writer at the time, due largely to the work of another Milwaukee authorwho had dealt with the semi-legendary ruler in his tale, “Fane of the BlackPharaoh.” But the discovery Bowen made in the crypt was totally unexpected.The reporter’s notebook said little of the actual nature of that discovery, butit recorded subsequent events in a precise, chronological fashion. Immediatelyupon unearthing his mysterious find in Egypt, Professor Bowen abandoned hisresearch and returned to Providence, where he purchased the Free-Will Church in1844 and made it the headquarters of what was called the “Starry Wisdom” sect.Members of this religious cult, evidently recruited by Bowen, professed toworship an entity they called the “Haunter of the Dark.” By gazing into acrystal they summoned the actual presence of this entity and did homage withblood sacrifice.Such, at least, was the fantastic story circulated in Providence at the time—andthe church became a place to be avoided. Local superstition fanned agitation,and agitation precipitated direct action. In May of 1877 the sect was forciblybroken up by the authorities, due to public pressure, and several hundred of itsmembers abruptly left the city.The church itself was immediately closed, and apparently individual curiositycould not overcome the widespread fear which resulted in leaving the structureundisturbed and unexplored until the reporter, Lillibridge, made his ill-fatedprivate investigation in 1893.Such was the gist of the story unfolded in the pages of his notebook. Blake readit, but was nevertheless undeterred in his further scrutiny of the environs.Eventually he came upon the mysterious object Bowen had found in the Egyptiancrypt—the object upon which the Starry Wisdom worship had been founded—theasymmetrical metal box with its curiously hinged lid, a lid that had been closedfor countless years. Blake thus gazed at the interior, gazed upon the four-inchred-black crystal polyhedron hanging suspended by seven supports. He not onlygazed at but also into the polyhedron; just as the cult-worshippers hadpurportedly gazed, and with the same results. He was assailed by a curiouspsychic disturbance; he seemed to “see visions of other lands and the gulfsbeyond the stars,” as superstitious accounts had told.And then Blake made his greatest mistake. He closed the box.Closing the box—again, according to the superstitions annotated byLillibridge—was the act that summoned the alien entity itself, the Haunter ofthe Dark. It was a creature of darkness and could not survive light. And in thatboarded-up blackness of the ruined church, the thing emerged by night.Blake fled the church in terror, but the damage was done. In mid-July, athunderstorm put out the lights in Providence for an hour, and the Italiancolony living near the deserted church heard bumping and thumping from insidethe shadow-shrouded structure.Crowds with candles stood outside in the rain and played candles upon thebuilding, shielding themselves against the possible emergence of the fearedentity by a barrier of light.Apparently the story had remained alive throughout the neighborhood. Once thestorm abated, local newspapers grew interested, and on the 17th of July tworeporters entered the old church, together with a policeman. Nothing definitewas found, although there were curious and inexplicable smears and stains on thestairs and the pews.Less than a month later—at 2:35 A.M. on the morning of August 8th, to beexact—Robert Harrison Blake met his death during an electrical storm whileseated before the window of his room on College Street.During the gathering storm, before his death occurred, Blake scribbledfrantically in his diary, gradually revealing his innermost obsessions anddelusions concerning the Haunter of the Dark. It was Blake’s conviction that bygazing into the curious crystal in its box he had somehow established a linkagewith the non-terrestrial entity. He further believed that closing the box hadsummoned the creature to dwell in the darkness of the church steeple, and thatin some way his own fate was now irrevocably linked to that of the monstrosity.All this is revealed in the last messages he set down while watching theprogress of the storm from his window.Meanwhile, at the church itself, on Federal Hill, a crowd of agitated spectatorsgathered to play lights upon the structure. That they heard alarming sounds frominside the boarded-up building is undeniable; at least two competent witnesseshave testified to the fact. One, Father Merluzzo of the Spirito Santo Church,was on hand to quiet his congregation. The other, Patrolman (now Sergeant)William J. Monahan, of Central Station, was attempting to preserve order in theface of growing panic. Monahan himself saw the blinding “blur” that seemed toissue, smoke-like, from the steeple of the ancient edifice as the finallightning-flash came.Flash, meteor, fireball—call it what you will—erupted over the city in ablinding blaze; perhaps at the very moment that Robert Harrison Blake, acrosstown, was writing, “Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique andshadowy Khem even took the form of man?”A few moments later he was dead. The coroner’s physician rendered a verdictattributing his demise to “electrical shock,” although the window he faced wasunbroken. Another physician, known to Lovecraft, quarreled privately with thatverdict and subsequently entered the affair the next day. Without legalauthority, he entered the church and climbed to the windowless steeple where hediscovered the strange asymmetrical—was it golden?—box and the curious stonewithin. Apparently his first gesture was to make sure of raising the lid andbringing the stone into the light. His next recorded gesture was to charter aboat, take box and curiously angled stone aboard, and drop them into the deepestchannel of Narragansett Bay.There ended the admittedly fictionalized account of Blake’s death as recorded byH. P. Lovecraft. And there began Edmund Fiske’s fifteen-year quest.Fiske, of course, had known some of the events outlined in the story. When Blakehad left for Providence in the spring, Fiske had tentatively promised to joinhim the following autumn. At first, the two friends had exchanged lettersregularly, but by early summer Blake ceased correspondence altogether.At the time, Fiske was unaware of Blake’s exploration of the ruined church. Hecould not account for Blake’s silence, and wrote Lovecraft for a possibleexplanation.Lovecraft could supply little information. Young Blake, he said, had visitedwith him frequently during the early weeks of his stay, had consulted him abouthis writing, and had accompanied him on several nocturnal strolls through thecity.But during the summer, Blake’s neighborliness ceased. It was not in Lovecraft’sreclusive nature to impose himself upon others, and he did not seek to invadeBlake’s privacy for several weeks.When he did so—and learned from the almost hysterical adolescent of hisexperiences in the forbidding, forbidden church on Federal Hill—Lovecraftoffered words of warning and advice. But it was already too late. Within tendays of his visit came the shocking end.Fiske learned of that end from Lovecraft on the following day. It was his taskto break the news to Blake’s parents. For a time he was tempted to visitProvidence immediately, but lack of funds and the pressure of his own domesticaffairs forestalled him. The body of his young friend duly arrived, and Fiskeattended the brief ceremony of cremation.Then Lovecraft began his own investigation—an investigation which ultimatelyresulted in the publication of his story. And there the matter might haverested.But Fiske was not satisfied.His best friend had died under circumstances which even the most skeptical mustadmit were mysterious. The local authorities summarily wrote off the matter witha fatuous and inadequate explanation.Fiske determined to ascertain the truth.Bear in mind one salient fact: all three of these men—Lovecraft, Blake, andFiske—were professional writers and students of the supernatural or thesupranormal. All three of them had extraordinary access to a bulk of writtenmaterial dealing with ancient legend and superstition. Ironically enough, theuse to which they put their knowledge was limited to excursions into so-calledfantasy fiction, but none of them, in the light of their own experience, couldwholly join their reading audience in scoffing at the myths of which they wrote.For, as Fiske wrote to Lovecraft, “the term myth, as we know, is merely a politeeuphemism. Blake’s death was not a myth, but a hideous reality. I implore you toinvestigate fully. See this matter through to the end, for if Blake’s diaryholds even a distorted truth, there is no telling what may be loosed upon theworld.”Lovecraft pledged cooperation, discovered the fate of the metal box and itscontents, and endeavored to arrange a meeting with Dr. Ambrose Dexter, ofBenefit Street. Dr. Dexter, it appeared, had left town immediately following hisdramatic theft and disposal of the “Shining Trapezohedron,” as Lovecraft calledit.Lovecraft then apparently interviewed Father Merluzzo and Patrolman Monahan,plunged into the files of the Bulletin, and endeavored to reconstruct the storyof the Starry Wisdom sect and the entity they worshipped.Of course he learned a good deal more than he dared to put into his magazinestory. His letters to Edmund Fiske in the late fall and early spring of 1936contain guarded hints and references to “menaces from Outside.” But he seemedanxious to reassure Fiske that if there had been any menace, even in therealistic rather than the supernatural sense, the danger was now averted becauseDr. Dexter had disposed of the Shining Trapezohedron, which acted as a summoningtalisman. Such was the gist of his report, and the matter rested there for atime.Fiske made tentative arrangements, early in 1937, to visit Lovecraft at hishome, with the private intention of doing some further research on his own intothe cause of Blake’s death. But once again, circumstances intervened. For inMarch of that year, Lovecraft died. His unexpected passing plunged Fiske into aperiod of mental despondency from which he was slow to recover; accordingly, itwas not until almost a year later that Edmund Fiske paid his first visit toProvidence, and to the scene of the tragic episodes which brought Blake’s lifeto a close.For somehow, always, a black undercurrent of suspicion existed. The coroner’sphysician had been glib, Lovecraft had been tactful, the press and the generalpublic had accepted matters completely—yet Blake was dead, and there had been anentity abroad in the night.Fiske felt that if he could visit the accursed church himself, talk to Dr.Dexter and find out what had drawn him into the affair, interrogate thereporters, and pursue any relevant leads or clues, he might eventually hope touncover the truth and at least clear his dead friend’s name of the ugly shadowof mental unbalance.Accordingly, Fiske’s first step after arriving in Providence and registering ata hotel was to set out for Federal Hill and the ruined church.The search was doomed to immediate, irremediable disappointment. For the churchwas no more. It had been razed the previous fall and the property taken over bythe city authorities. The black and baleful spire no longer cast its spell overthe Hill.Fiske immediately took pains to see Father Merluzzo, at Spirito Santo, a fewsquares away. He learned from a courteous housekeeper that Father Merluzzo haddied in 1936, within a year of young Blake.Discouraged but persistent, Fiske next attempted to reach Dr. Dexter, but theold house on Benefit Street was boarded up. A call to the Physicians’ ServiceBureau produced only the cryptic information that Ambrose Dexter, M.D., had leftthe city for an indeterminate stay.Nor did a visit with the city editor of the Bulletin yield any better result.Fiske was permitted to go into the newspaper’s morgue and read the aggravatinglyshort and matter-of-fact story on Blake’s death, but the two reporters who hadcovered the assignment and subsequently visited the Federal Hill church had leftthe paper for berths in other cities.There were, of course, other leads to follow, and during the ensuing week Fiskeran them all to the ground. A copy of Who’s Who added nothing significant to hismental picture of Dr. Ambrose Dexter. The physician was Providence-born, alifelong resident, forty years of age, unmarried, a general practitioner, memberof several medical societies—but there was no indication of any unusual“hobbies” or “other interests” which might provide a clue as to hisparticipation in the affair.Sergeant William J. Monahan of Central Station was sought out, and for the firsttime Fiske actually managed to speak to someone who admitted an actualconnection with the events leading to Blake’s death. Monahan was polite, butcautiously noncommittal.Despite Fiske’s complete unburdening, the police officer remained discreetlyreticent.“There’s really nothing I can tell you,” he said. “It’s true, like Mr. Lovecraftsaid, that I was at the church that night, for there was a rough crowd out andthere’s no telling what some of them ones in the neighborhood will do when riledup. Like the story said, the old church had a bad name, and I guess Sheeleycould have given you many’s the story.”“Sheeley?” interjected Fiske.“Bert Sheeley—it was his beat, you know, not mine. He was ill of pneumonia atthe time, and I substituted for two weeks. Then, when he died—”Fiske shook his head. Another possible source of information gone. Blake dead,Lovecraft dead, Father Merluzzo dead, and now Sheeley. Reporters scattered, andDr. Dexter mysteriously missing. He sighed and persevered.“That last night, when you saw the blur,” he asked, “can you add anything by wayof details? Were there any noises? Did anyone in the crowd say anything? Try toremember—whatever you can add may be of great help to me.”Monahan shook his head. “There were noises aplenty,” he said. “But what with thethunder and all, I couldn’t rightly make out if anything came from inside thechurch, like the story has it. And as for the crowd, with the women wailing andthe men muttering, all mixed up with thunderclaps and wind, it was as much as Icould do to hear myself yelling to keep in place, let alone make out what wasbeing said.”“And the blur?” Fiske persisted.“It was a blur, and that’s all. Smoke, or a cloud, or just a shadow before thelightning struck again. But I’ll not be saying I saw any devils, or monsters, orwhatchamacallits as Mr. Lovecraft would write about in those wild tales of his.”Sergeant Monahan shrugged self-righteously and picked up the desk-phone toanswer a call. The interview was obviously at an end.And so, for the nonce, was Fiske’s quest. He didn’t abandon hope, however. For aday he sat by his own hotel phone and called up every “Dexter” listed in thebook in an effort to locate a relative of the missing doctor; but to no avail.Another day was spent in a small boat on Narragansett Bay, as Fiske assiduouslyand painstakingly familiarized himself with the location of the “deepestchannel” alluded to in Lovecraft’s story.But at the end of a futile week in Providence, Fiske had to confess himselfbeaten. He returned to Chicago, his work, and his normal pursuits. Gradually theaffair dropped out of the foreground of his consciousness, but he by no meansforgot it completely or gave up the notion of eventually unraveling themystery—if mystery there was.* * *In 1941, during a three-day furlough from Basic Training, Pvt. First ClassEdmund Fiske passed through Providence on his way to New York City and againattempted to locate Dr. Ambrose Dexter, without success.During 1942 and 1943 Sgt. Edmund Fiske wrote, from his stations overseas, to Dr.Ambrose Dexter c/o General Delivery, Providence, R.I. His letters were neveracknowledged, if indeed they were received.In 1945, in a U.S.O. library lounge in Honolulu, Fiske read a report in—of allthings—a journal on astrophysics which mentioned a recent gathering at PrincetonUniversity, at which the guest speaker, Dr. Ambrose Dexter, had delivered anaddress on “Practical Applications in Military Technology.”Fiske did not return to the States until the end of 1946. Domestic affairs,naturally, were the subject of his paramount consideration during the followingyear. It wasn’t until 1948 that he accidentally came upon Dr. Dexter’s nameagain—this time in a listing of “investigators in the field of nuclear physics”in a national weekly newsmagazine. He wrote the editors for further information,but received no reply. And another letter, dispatched to Providence, remainedunanswered.But in 1949, late in autumn, Dexter’s name again came to his attention throughthe news columns; this time in relation to a discussion of work on the secretH-bomb.Whatever he guessed, whatever he feared, whatever he wildly imagined, Fiske wasimpelled to action. It was then that he wrote to a certain Ogden Purvis, aprivate investigator in the city of Providence, and commissioned him to locateDr. Ambrose Dexter. All that he required was that he be placed in communicationwith Dexter, and he paid a substantial retainer fee. Purvis took the case.The private detective sent several reports to Fiske in Chicago, and they were,at first, disheartening. The Dexter residence was still untenanted. Dexterhimself, according to the information elicited from governmental sources, was ona special mission. The private investigator seemed to assume from this that hewas a person above reproach, engaged in confidential defense work.Fiske’s own reaction was panic.He raised his offer of a fee and insisted that Ogden Purvis continue his effortsto find the elusive doctor.Winter of 1950 came and, with it, another report. The private investigator hadtracked down every lead Fiske suggested, and one of them led, eventually, to TomJonas.Tom Jonas was the owner of the small boat which had been chartered by Dr. Dexterone evening in the late summer of 1935—the small boat which had been rowed tothe “deepest channel of Narragansett Bay.”Tom Jonas had rested his oars as Dexter threw overboard the dully gleaming,asymmetrical metal box with the hinged lid open to disclose the ShiningTrapezohedron.The old fisherman had spoken freely to the private detective; his words werereported in detail to Fiske via confidential report.“Mighty peculiar” was Jonas’s own reaction to the incident. Dexter had offeredhim “twenty smackers to take the boat out in the middle o’ midnight and heavethis funny-lookin’ contraption overboard. Said there was no harm in it; said itwas just an old keepsake he wanted to git rid of. But all the way out he kep’starin’ at the sort of jewel-thing set in some iron bands inside the box, andmumblin’ in some foreign language, I guess. No, ’tweren’t French or German orItalian talk, either. Polish, mebbe. I don’t remember any words, either. But heacted sort of drunk. Not that I’d say anything against Dr. Dexter, understand;comes of a fine old family, even if he ain’t been around these parts since, tomy knowing. But I figgered he was a bit under the influence, you might say. Elsewhy would he pay me twenty smackers to do a crazy stunt like that?”There was more to the verbatim transcript of the old fisherman’s monologue, butit did not explain anything.“He sure seemed glad to git rid of it, as I recollect. On the way back he toldme to keep mum about it, but I can’t see no harm in telling at this late date; Iwouldn’t hold anythin’ back from the law.”Evidently the private investigator had made use of a rather unethicalstratagem—posing as an actual detective in order to get Jonas to talk.This did not bother Fiske, in Chicago. It was enough to get his grasp onsomething tangible at last; enough to make him send Purvis another payment, withinstructions to keep up the search for Ambrose Dexter. Several months passed inwaiting.Then, in late spring, came the news Fiske had waited for. Dr. Dexter was back;he had returned to his house on Benefit Street. The boards had been removed,furniture vans arrived to discharge their contents, and a manservant appeared toanswer the door and to take telephone messages.Dr. Dexter was not at home to the investigator, or to anyone. He was, itappeared, recuperating from a severe illness contracted while in governmentservice. He took a card from Purvis and promised to deliver a message, butrepeated calls brought no indication of a reply.Nor did Purvis, who conscientiously “cased” the house and neighborhood, eversucceed in laying eyes upon the doctor himself or in finding anyone who claimedto have seen the convalescent physician on the street.Groceries were delivered regularly; mail appeared in the box; lights glowed inthe Benefit Street house nightly until all hours.As a matter of fact, this was the only concrete statement Purvis could makeregarding any possible irregularity in Dr. Dexter’s mode of life—he seemed tokeep electricity burning twenty-four hours a day.Fiske promptly dispatched another letter to Dr. Dexter, and then another. Stillno acknowledgment or reply was forthcoming. And after several moreunenlightening reports from Purvis, Fiske made up his mind. He would go toProvidence and see Dexter, somehow, come what may.He might be completely wrong in his suspicions; he might be completely wrong inhis assumption that Dr. Dexter could clear the name of his dead friend; he mightbe completely wrong in even surmising any connection between the two—but forfifteen years he had brooded and wondered, and it was time to put an end to hisown inner conflict.Accordingly, late that summer, Fiske wired Purvis of his intentions andinstructed him to meet him at the hotel upon his arrival.Thus it was that Edmund Fiske came to Providence for the last time; on the daythat the Giants lost, on the day that the Langer Brothers lost their two blackpanthers, on the day that cabdriver William Hurley was in a garrulous mood.Purvis was not at the hotel to meet him, but such was Fiske’s own frenzy ofimpatience that he decided to act without him and drove, as we have seen, toBenefit Street in the early evening.As the cab departed, Fiske stared up at the paneled doorway; stared at thelights blazing from the upper windows of the Georgian structure. A brassnameplate gleamed on the door itself, and the light from the windows played uponthe legend AMBROSE DEXTER, M.D.Slight as it was, this seemed a reassuring touch to Edmund Fiske. The doctor wasnot concealing his presence in the house from the world, however much he mightconceal his actual person. Surely the blazing lights and the appearance of thenameplate augured well.Fiske shrugged, rang the bell.The door opened quickly. A small, dark-skinned man with a slight stoop appearedand made a question of the word, “Yes?”“Dr. Dexter, please.”“The doctor is not in to callers. He is ill.”“Would you take a message, please?”“Certainly.” The dark-skinned servant smiled.“Tell him that Edmund Fiske of Chicago wishes to see him at his convenience fora few moments. I have come all the way from the Middle West for this purpose,and what I have to speak to him about would take only a moment or two of histime.”“Wait, please.”The door closed. Fiske stood in the gathering darkness and transferred hisbriefcase from one hand to the other.Abruptly, the door opened again. The servant peered out at him.“Mr. Fiske—are you the gentleman who wrote the letters?”“Letters—oh, yes, I am. I did not know the doctor ever received them.”The servant nodded. “I could not say. But Dr. Dexter said that if you were theman who had written him, you were to come right in.”Fiske permitted himself an audible sigh of relief as he stepped over thethreshold. It had taken fifteen years to come this far, and now—“Just go upstairs, if you please. You will find Dr. Dexter waiting in the study,right at the head of the hall.”Edmund Fiske climbed the stairs, turned at the top to a doorway, and entered aroom in which the light was an almost palpable presence, so intense was itsglare.And there, rising from a chair beside the fireplace, was Dr. Ambrose Dexter.Fiske found himself facing a tall, thin, immaculately dressed man who may havebeen fifty but who scarcely looked thirty-five; a man whose wholly natural graceand elegance of movement concealed the sole incongruity of his aspect—a verydeep suntan.“So you are Edmund Fiske.”The voice was soft, well-modulated, and unmistakably New England—and theaccompanying handclasp warm and firm. Dr. Dexter’s smile was natural andfriendly. White teeth gleamed against the brown background of his features.“Won’t you sit down?” invited the doctor. He indicated a chair and bowedslightly. Fiske couldn’t help but stare; there was certainly no indication ofany present or recent illness in his host’s demeanor or behavior. As Dr. Dexterresumed his own seat near the fire and Fiske moved around the chair to join him,he noted the bookshelves on either side of the room. The size and shape ofseveral volumes immediately engaged his rapt attention—so much that he hesitatedbefore taking a seat, and instead inspected the titles of the tomes.For the first time in his life, Edmund Fiske found himself confronting thehalf-legendary De Vermis Mysteriis, the Liber Ivonis, and the almost mythicalLatin version of the Necronomicon. Without seeking his host’s permission, helifted the bulk of the latter volume from the shelf and riffled through theyellowed pages of the Spanish translation of 1622.Then he turned to Dr. Dexter, and all traces of his carefully contrivedcomposure dropped away. “Then it must have been you who found these books in thechurch,” he said. “In the rear vestry room beside the apse. Lovecraft mentionedthem in his story, and I’ve always wondered what became of them.”Dr. Dexter nodded gravely. “Yes, I took them. I did not think it wise for suchbooks to fall into the hands of the authorities. You know what they contain, andwhat might happen if such knowledge were wrongfully employed.”Fiske reluctantly replaced the great book on the shelf and took a chair facingthe doctor before the fire. He held his briefcase on his lap and fumbleduneasily with the clasp.“Don’t be uneasy,” said Dr. Dexter, with a kindly smile. “Let us proceed withoutfencing. You are here to discover what part I played in the affair of yourfriend’s death.”“Yes, there are some questions I wanted to ask.”“Please.” The doctor raised a slim brown hand. “I am not in the best of healthand can give you only a few minutes. Allow me to anticipate your queries andtell you what little I know.”“As you wish.” Fiske stared at the bronzed man, wondering what lay behind theperfection of his poise.“I met your friend Robert Harrison Blake only once,” said Dr. Dexter. “It was onan evening during the latter part of July, 1935. He called upon me here, as apatient.”Fiske leaned forward eagerly. “I never knew that!” he exclaimed.“There was no reason for anyone to know it,” the doctor answered. “He was merelya patient. He claimed to be suffering from insomnia. I examined him, prescribeda sedative, and acting on the merest surmise, asked if he had recently beensubjected to any unusual strain or trauma. It was then that he told me the storyof his visit to the church on Federal Hill and of what he had found there. Imust say that I had the acumen not to dismiss his tale as the product of ahysterical imagination. As a member of one of the older families here, I wasalready acquainted with the legends surrounding the Starry Wisdom sect and theso-called Haunter of the Dark.“Young Blake confessed to me certain of his fears concerning the ShiningTrapezohedron—intimating that it was a focal point of primal evil. He furtheradmitted his own dread of being somehow linked to the monstrosity in the church.“Naturally, I was not prepared to accept this last premise as a rational one. Iattempted to reassure the young man, advised him to leave Providence and forgetit. And at the time I acted in all good faith. And then, in August, came news ofBlake’s death.”“So you went to the church,” Fiske said.“Wouldn’t you have done the same thing?” parried Dr. Dexter. “If Blake had cometo you with this story, told you of what he feared, wouldn’t his death havemoved you to action? I assure you, I did what I thought best. Rather thanprovoke a scandal, rather than expose the general public to needless fears,rather than permit the possibility of danger to exist, I went to the church. Itook the books. I took the Shining Trapezohedron from under the noses of theauthorities. And I chartered a boat and dumped the accursed thing inNarragansett Bay, where it could no longer possibly harm mankind. The lid was upwhen I dropped it—for as you know, only darkness can summon the Haunter, and nowthe stone is eternally exposed to light.“But that is all I can tell you. I regret that my work in recent years hasprevented me from seeing or communicating with you before this. I appreciateyour interest in the affair and trust my remarks will help to clarify, in asmall way, your bewilderment. As to young Blake, in my capacity as examiningphysician, I will gladly give you a written testimony to my belief in his sanityat the time of his death. I’ll have it drawn up tomorrow and send it to yourhotel if you give me the address. Fair enough?”The doctor rose, signifying that the interview was over. Fiske remained seated,shifting his briefcase.“Now if you will excuse me,” the physician murmured.“In a moment. There are still one or two brief questions I’d appreciate youranswering.”“Certainly.” If Dr. Dexter was irritated, he gave no sign.“Did you by any chance see Lovecraft before or during his last illness?”“No. I was not his physician. In fact, I never met the man, though of course Iknew of him and his work.”“What caused you to leave Providence so abruptly after the Blake affair?”“My interests in physics superseded my interest in medicine. As you may or maynot know, during the past decade or more, I have been working on problemsrelative to atomic energy and nuclear fission. In fact, starting tomorrow, I amleaving Providence once more to deliver a course of lectures before thefaculties of eastern universities and certain governmental groups.”“That is very interesting to me, Doctor,” said Fiske. “By the way, did you evermeet Einstein?”“As a matter of fact, I did, some years ago. I worked with him on—but no matter.I must beg you to excuse me now. At another time, perhaps, we can discuss suchthings.”His impatience was unmistakable now. Fiske rose, lifting his briefcase in onehand and reaching out to extinguish a table lamp with the other.Dr. Dexter crossed swiftly and lighted the lamp again.“Why are you afraid of the dark, Doctor?” asked Fiske, softly.“I am not af—”For the first time the physician seemed on the verge of losing his composure.“What makes you think that?” he whispered.“It’s the Shining Trapezohedron, isn’t it?” Fiske continued. “When you threw itinto the bay you acted too hastily. You didn’t remember at the time that even ifyou left the lid open, the stone would be surrounded by darkness there at thebottom of the channel. Perhaps the Haunter didn’t want you to remember. Youlooked into the stone just as Blake did, and established the same psychiclinkage. And when you threw the thing away, you gave it into perpetual darkness,where the Haunter’s power would feed and grow.“That’s why you left Providence—because you were afraid the Haunter would cometo you, just as it came to Blake. And because you knew that now the thing wouldremain abroad forever.”Dr. Dexter moved toward the door. “I must definitely ask that you leave now,” hesaid. “If you’re implying that I keep the lights on because I’m afraid of theHaunter coming after me, the way it did Blake, then you’re mistaken.”Fiske smiled wryly. “That’s not it at all,” he answered. “I know you don’t fearthat. Because it’s too late. The Haunter must have come to you long beforethis—perhaps within a day or so after you gave it power by consigning theTrapezohedron to the darkness of the Bay. It came to you, but unlike the case ofBlake, it did not kill you.“It used you. That’s why you fear the dark. You fear it as the Haunter itselffears being discovered. I believe that in the darkness you look different. Morelike the old shape. Because when the Haunter came to you, it did not kill butinstead, merged. You are the Haunter of the Dark!”“Mr. Fiske, really—”“There is no Dr. Dexter. There hasn’t been any such person for many years, now.There’s only the outer shell, possessed by an entity older than the world; anentity that is moving quickly and cunningly to bring destruction to all mankind.It was you who turned ‘scientist’ and insinuated yourself into the propercircles, hinting and prompting and assisting foolish men into their sudden‘discovery’ of nuclear fission. When the first atomic bomb fell, how you musthave laughed! And now you’ve given them the secret of the hydrogen bomb, andyou’re going on to teach them more, show them new ways to bring about their owndestruction.“It took me years of brooding to discover the clues, the keys to the so-calledwild myths that Lovecraft wrote about. For he wrote in parable and allegory, buthe wrote the truth. He has set it down in black and white time and again, theprophecy of your coming to earth—Blake knew it at the last when he identifiedthe Haunter by its rightful name.”“And that is?” snapped the doctor.“Nyarlathotep!”The brown face creased into a grimace of laughter. “I’m afraid you’re a victimof the same fantasy-projections as poor Blake and your friend Lovecraft.Everyone knows that Nyarlathotep is pure invention—part of the Lovecraftmythos.”“I thought so, until I found the clue in his poem. That’s when it all fitted in;the Haunter of the Dark, your fleeing, and your sudden interest in scientificresearch. Lovecraft’s words took on a new meaning:“And at the last from inner Egypt cameThe strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed.”Fiske chanted the lines, staring at the dark face of the physician.“Nonsense—if you must know, this dermatological disturbance of mine is theresult of exposure to radiation at Los Alamos.”Fiske did not heed; he was continuing Lovecraft’s poem:“—That wild beasts followed him and licked his hands.Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolledDown on the quaking citadels of man.Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,The idiot Chaos blew Earth’s dust away.”Dr. Dexter shook his head. “Ridiculous on the face of it,” he asserted. “Surely,even in your—er—upset condition, you can understand that, man! The poem has noliteral meaning. Do wild beasts lick my hands? Is something rising from the sea?Are there earthquakes and auroras? Nonsense! You’re suffering from a bad case ofwhat we call ‘atomic jitters’—I can see it now. You’re preoccupied, as so manylaymen are today, with the foolish obsession that somehow our work in nuclearfission will result in the destruction of the earth. All this rationalization isa product of your imaginings.”Fiske held his briefcase tightly. “I told you it was a parable, this prophecy ofLovecraft’s. God knows what he knew or feared; whatever it was, it was enough tomake him cloak his meaning. And even then, perhaps, they got to him because heknew too much.”“They?”“They from Outside—the ones you serve. You are their Messenger, Nyarlathotep.You came, in linkage with the Shining Trapezohedron, out of inner Egypt, as thepoem says. And the fellahs—the common workers of Providence who became convertedto the Starry Wisdom sect—bowed before the ‘strange dark one’ they worshipped asthe Haunter.“The Trapezohedron was thrown into the Bay, and soon from the sea came thisnoxious birth—your birth, or incarnation in the body of Dr. Dexter. And youtaught men new methods of destruction; destruction with atomic bombs in whichthe ‘ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled down on the quaking citadels ofman.’ Oh, Lovecraft knew what he was writing, and Blake recognized you, too. Andthey both died. I suppose you’ll try to kill me now, so you can go on. You’lllecture, and stand at the elbows of the laboratory men urging them on and givingthem new suggestions to result in greater destruction. And finally you’ll blowearth’s dust away.”“Please.” Dr. Dexter held out both hands. “Control yourself—let me get yousomething! Can’t you realize this whole thing is absurd?”Fiske moved toward him, hands fumbling at the clasp of the briefcase. The flapopened, and Fiske reached inside, then withdrew his hand. He held a revolvernow, and he pointed it quite steadily at Dr. Dexter’s breast.“Of course it’s absurd,” Fiske muttered. “No one ever believed in the StarryWisdom sect except a few fanatics and some ignorant foreigners. No one ever tookBlake’s stories or Lovecraft’s, or mine for that matter, as anything but arather morbid form of amusement. By the same token, no one will ever believethere is anything wrong with you, and with so-called scientific investigation ofatomic energy, or the other horrors you plan to loose on the world to bringabout its doom. And that’s why I’m going to kill you now!”“Put down that gun!”Fiske began suddenly to tremble; his whole body shook in a spectacular spasm.Dexter noted it and moved forward. The younger man’s eyes were bulging, and thephysician inched toward him.“Stand back!” Fiske warned. The words were distorted by the convulsiveshuddering of his jaws. “That’s all I needed to know. Since you are in a humanbody, you can be destroyed by ordinary weapons. As so I do destroyyou—Nyarlathotep!”His finger moved.So did Dr. Dexter’s. His hand went swiftly behind him, to the masterlight-switch on the wall. A click, and the room was plunged into utter darkness.Not utter darkness—for there was a glow.The face and hands of Dr. Ambrose Dexter glowed with a phosphorescent fire inthe dark. There are presumable forms of radium poisoning which can cause such aneffect, and no doubt Dr. Dexter would have so explained the phenomenon to EdmundFiske, had he the opportunity.But there was no opportunity. Edmund Fiske heard the click, saw the fantasticflaming features, and pitched forward to the floor.Dr. Dexter quietly switched on the lights, went over to the younger man’s side,and knelt for a long moment. He sought a pulse in vain.Edmund Fiske was dead.The doctor sighed, rose, and left the room. In the hall downstairs he summonedhis servant.“There has been a regrettable accident,” he said. “That young visitor of mine—ahysteric—suffered a heart attack. You had better call the police, immediately.And then continue with the packing. We must leave tomorrow, for the lecturetour.”“But the police may detain you.”Dr. Dexter shook his head. “I think not. It’s a clear-cut case. In any event, Ican easily explain. When they arrive, notify me. I shall be in the garden.”The doctor proceeded down the hall to the rear exit and emerged upon the moonlitsplendor of the garden behind the house on Benefit Street.The radiant vista was walled off from the world, utterly deserted. The dark manstood in moonlight, and its glow mingled with his own aura.At this moment two silken shadows leaped over the wall. They crouched in thecoolness of the garden, then slithered forward toward Dr. Dexter. They madepanting sounds.In the moonlight, he recognized the shapes of two black panthers.Immobile, he waited as they advanced, padding purposefully toward him, eyesaglow, jaws slavering and agape.Dr. Dexter turned away. His face was turned in mockery to the moon as the beastsfawned before him and licked his hands.* Originally published in Weird Tales, September 1950."},{"pageContent":"NOTEBOOK FOUND IN A DESERTED HOUSE*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]ROBERT BLOCH[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]First off, I want to write that I never did anything wrong. Not to nobody. Theygot no call to shut me up here, whoever they are. They got no reason to do whatI’m afraid they’re going to do, either.I think they’re coming pretty soon, because they’ve been gone outside a longtime. Digging, I guess, in that old well. Looking for a gate, I heard. Not aregular gate, of course, but something else.Got a notion what they mean, and I’m scared.I’d look out the windows but of course they are boarded up so I can’t see.But I turned on the lamp, and I found this here notebook so I want to put it alldown. Then if I get a chance maybe I can send it to somebody who can help me. Ormaybe somebody will find it. Anyway, it’s better to write it out as best I caninstead of just sitting here and waiting. Waiting for them to come and get me.I better start by telling my name, which is Willie Osborne, and that I am 12years old last July. I don’t know where I was born.First thing I can remember is living out Roodsford way, out in what folks callthe back hill country. It’s real lonesome out there, with deep woods all aroundand lots of mountains and hills that nobody ever climbs.Grandma use to tell me about it when I was just a little shaver. That’s who Ilived with, just Grandma on account of my real folks being dead. Grandma was theone who taught me how to read and write. I never been to a regular school.Grandma knew all kinds of things about the hills and the woods and she told mesome mighty queer stories. That’s what I thought they was, anyway, when I waslittle and living all alone with her. Just stories, like the ones in books.Like stories about them ones hiding in the swamps, that was here before thesettlers and the Indians both and how there was circles in swamps and big stonescalled alters where them ones use to make sacrefices to what they worshiped.Grandma got some of the stories from her Grandma she said—about how them oneshid in the woods and swamps because they couldn’t stand sunshine, and how theIndians kept out of their way. She said sometimes the Indians would leave someof their young people tied to trees in the forest as a sacrefice, so as to keepthem contented and peacefull.Indians knew all about them, and they tried to keep white folks from noticingtoo much or settling too close to the hills. Them ones didn’t cause muchtrouble, but they might if they was crowded. So the Indians give excuses not forsettling, saying there weren’t enough hunting and no trails and it was too faroff from the coast.Grandma told me that was why not many places was settled even today. Nothing buta few farmhouses here and there. She told me them ones was still alive andsometimes on certain nights in the Spring and Fall you could see lights and hearnoises far off on the tops of the hills.Grandma said I had an Aunt Lucy and a Uncle Fred who lived out there right smackin the middle of the hills. Said my Pa used to visit them before he got marriedand once he heard them beating on a tree drum one night along about Halloweentime. That was before he met Ma and they got married and she died when I comeand he went away.I heard all kinds of stories. About witches and devils and bat men that suckedyour blood and haunts. About Salem and Arkham because I never been to a city andI wanted to hear tell how they were. About a place called Innsmouth with oldrotten houses where people hid awful things away in the cellars and the attics.She told me bout the way graves was dug deep under Arkham. Made it sound likethe whole country was full of haunts.She use to scare me, telling about how some of these things looked and all butshe never would tell me how them ones looked no matter how much I asked. Saidshe didn’t want me to have any truck with such things—bad enough she and her kinknew as much as they did—allmost too much for decent God fearing people. It waslucky for me I didn’t have to bother with such ideas, like my own ancestor on myfather’s side, Mehitabel Osborne, who got hanged for a witch back in the Salemdays.So they was just stories to me until last year when Grandma died and JudgeCrubinthorp put me on the train and I went out to live with Aunt Lucy and UncleFred in the very same hills that Grandma use to tell about so often.You can bet I was pretty excited, and the conductor let me ride with him all theway and told me about the towns and everything.Uncle Fred met me at the station. He was a tall thin man with a long beard. Wedrove off in a buggy from the little deepo—no houses around there ornothing—right into the woods.Funny thing about those woods. They was so still and quiet. Gave me the creepsthey was so dark and lonesome. Seemed like nobody had ever shouted or laughed oreven smiled in them. Couldn’t imagine anyone saying anything there excep inwhispers.Trees and all was so old, too. No animals around or birds. Path kind ofovergrown like nobody used it much ever. Uncle Fred drove along right fast, hedidn’t hardly talk to me at all but just made that old horse hump it.Pretty soon we struck into some hills, they was awfully high ones. They waswoods on them, too, and sometimes a brook come running down, but I didn’t see nohouses and it was always dark like at twilight, wherever you looked.Lastly we got to the farmhouse—a little place, old frame house and barn in aclear space and trees all around kind of gloomy-like. Aunt Lucy come out to meetus, she was a nice sort of little middle-aged lady who hugged me and took mystuff in back.But all this don’t hold with what I’m supposed to write down here. It don’tmatter that all this last year I was living in the house here with them, eatingoff the stuff Uncle Fred farmed without ever going into town. No other farmsaround here for almost four mile and no school—so evenings Aunt Lucy would helpme with my reading. I never played much.At first I was scared of going into the woods on account of what Grandma hadtold me. Besides, I could tell as Aunt Lucy and Uncle Fred was scared ofsomething from the way they locked the doors at night and never went into thewoods after dark, even in summer.But after a while, I got used to the idea of living in the woods and they didn’tseem so scarey. I did chores for Uncle Fred, of course, but sometimes inafternoons when he was busy, I’d go off by myself. Particular by the time it wasfall.And that’s how I heard one of the things. It was early October, I was in theglen right by the big boulder. Then the noise started. I got behind that rockfast.You see, like I say, there isn’t any animals in the woods. Nor people. Excepperhaps old Cap Pritchett the mailman who only comes through on Thursdayafternoons.So when I heard a sound that wasn’t Uncle Fred or Aunt Lucy calling to me, Iknew I better hide.About that sound. It was far-away at first, kind of a dropping noise. Soundedlike the blood falling in little spurts on the bottom of the bucket when UncleFred hung up a butchered hog.I looked around but I couldn’t make out nothing, and I couldn’t figure out thedirection the noise was from either. The noise sort of stopped for a minute andthey was only twilight and trees, still as death. Then the noise started again,nearer and louder.Sounded like a lot of people running or walking all at once, moving this way.Twigs busting under feet and scrabbling in the bushes all mixed up in the noise.I scrunched down behind that boulder and kept real quiet.I can tell that whatever makes the noise, it’s real close now, right in theglen. I want to look up but dassn’t because the sound is so loud and mean. Andalso there is an awful smell like something that was dead and buried beinguncovered again in the sun.All at once the noise stops again and I can tell that whatever makes it is realclose by. For a minute the woods are creepy-still. Then comes the sound.It’s a voice and it’s not a voice. That is, it doesn’t sound like a voice butmore like a buzzing or croaking, deep and droning. But it has to be a voicebecause it is saying words.Not words I could understand, but words. Words that made me keep my head down,half afraid I might be seen and half afraid I might see something. I stayedthere sweating and shaking. The smell was making me pretty sick, but that awful,deep droning voice was worse. Saying over and over something like“E uh shub nigger ath ngaa ryla neb shoggoth.”I can’t hope to spell it out the way it sounded, but I heard it enough times toremember. I was still listening when the smell got awful thick and I guess Imust have fainted because when I woke up the voice was gone and it was gettingquite dark.I ran all the way home that night, but not before I saw where the thing hadstood when it talked—and it was a thing.No human being can leave tracks in the mud like goat’s hoofs all green withslime that smell awful—not four or eight, but a couple hundred!I didn’t tell Aunt Lucy or Uncle Fred. But that night when I went to bed I hadterrible dreams. I thought I was back in the glen, only this time I could seethe thing. It was real tall and all inky-black, without any particular shapeexcept a lot of black ropes with ends like hoofs on it. I mean, it had a shapebut it kep changing—all bulgy and squirming into different sizes. They was a lotof mouths all over the thing like puckered up leaves on branches.That’s as close as I can come. The mouths was like leaves and the whole thingwas like a tree in the wind, a black tree with lots of branches trailing theground, and a whole lot of roots ending in hoofs. And that green slime dribblingout of the mouths and down the legs was like sap!Next day I remembered to look in a book Aunt Lucy had downstairs. It was calleda mythology. This book told about some people who lived over in England andFrance in the old days and was called Druids. They worshiped trees and thoughtthey was alive. Maybe this thing was like what they worshiped—called anature-spirit.But these Druids lived across the ocean, so how could it be? I did a lot ofthinking about it the next couple days, and you can bet I didn’t go out to playin those woods again.At last I figgered it out something like this.Maybe those Druids got chased out of the forests over in England and France andsome of them was smart enough to build boats and come across the ocean like oldLeaf Erikson is supposed to have. Then they could maybe settle in the woods backhere and frighten away the Indians with their magic spells.They would know how to hide themselves away in the swamps and go right on withtheir heathen worshiping and call up these spirits out of the ground or whereverthey come from.Indians use to believe that white gods come from out of the sea a long time ago.What if that was just another way of telling how the Druids got here? Some realcivilized Indians down in Mexico or South America—Aztecs or Inkas, I guess—saida white god come over in a boat and taught them all kinds of magic. Couldn’t heof been a Druid?That would explain Grandma’s stories about them ones, too.Those Druids hiding in the swamps would be the ones who did the drumming andpounding and lit the fires on the hills. And they would be calling up them ones,the tree spirits or whatever, out of the earth. Then they would make sacrefices.Those Druids always made sacrefices with blood, just like the old witches. Anddidn’t Grandma tell about people who lived too near the hills disappearing andnever being found again?We lived in a spot just exactly like that.And it was getting close to Halloween. That was the big time, Grandma alwayssaid.I began to wonder—how soon now?Got so scared I didn’t go out of the house. Aunt Lucy made me take a tonic, saidI looked peaked. Guess I did. All I know is one afternoon when I heard a buggycoming through the woods I ran and hid under the bed.But it was only Cap Pritchett with the mail. Uncle Fred got it and come in allexcited with a letter.Cousin Osborne was coming to stay with us. He was kin to Aunt Lucy and he had avacation and he wanted to stay a week. He’d get here on the same train I did—theonly train they was passing through these parts—on noon, October 25th.For the next few days we was all so excited that I forgot all my crazy notionsfor a spell. Uncle Fred fixed up the back room for Cousin Osborne to sleep inand I helped him with the carpenter parts of the job.Days got shorter right along, and the nights was all cold with big winds. It waspretty brisk the morning of the 25th and Uncle Fred bundled up warm to drivethrough the woods. He meant to fetch Cousin Osborne at noon, and it was sevenmile to the station. He wouldn’t take me, and I didn’t beg. Them woods was toofull of creaking and rustling sounds from the wind—sounds that might besomething else, too.Well, he left, and Aunt Lucy and I stayed in the house. She was putting uppreserves now—plums—for over the winter season. I washed out jars from the well.Seems like I should have told about them having two wells. A new one with a bigshiny pump, close to the house. Then an old stone one out by the barn, with thepump gone. It never had been any good, Uncle Fred said, it was there when theybought the place. Water was all slimy. Something funny about it, because evenwithout a pump, sometimes it seemed to back up. Uncle Fred couldn’t figure itout, but some mornings water would be running out over the sides—green, slimywater that smelled terrible.We kep away from it and I was by the new well, till along about noon when itstarted in to cloud up. Aunt Lucy fixed lunch, and it started to rain hard withthunder rolling in off the big hills in the west.Seemed to me Uncle Fred and Cousin Osborne was going to have troubles gettinghome in the storm, but Aunt Lucy didn’t fret about it—just made me help her putup the stock.Come five o’clock, getting dark, and still no Uncle Fred. Then we begun toworry. Maybe the train was late, or something happened to the horse or buggy.Six o’clock and still no Uncle Fred. The rain stopped, but you could still hearthe thunder sort of growling off in the hills, and the wet branches kep drippingdown in the woods, making a sound like women laughing.Maybe the road was too bad for them to get through. Buggy might bog down in themud. Perhaps they decided to stay in the deepo over night.Seven o’clock and it was pitch dark outside. No rain sounds any more. Aunt Lucywas awful worried. She said for us to go out and post a lantern on the fencerail by the road.We went down the path to the fence. It was dark and the wind had died down.Everything was still, like in the deep part of the woods. I felt kind of scaredjust walking down the path with Aunt Lucy—like something was out there in thequiet dark, someplace, waiting to grab me.We lit the lantern and stood there looking down the dark road and, “What’sthat?” said Aunt Lucy, real sharp. I listened and heard a drumming sound faraway.“Horse and buggy,” I said. Aunt Lucy perked up.“You’re right,” she says, all at once. And it is, because we see it. The horseis running fast and the buggy lurches behind it, crazy-like. It don’t even takea second look to see something has happened, because the buggy don’t stop by thegate but keeps going up to the barn with Aunt Lucy and me running through themud after the horse. The horse is all full of lather and foam, and when it stopsit can’t stand still. Aunt Lucy and I wait for Uncle Fred and Cousin Osborne tostep out, but nothing happens. We look inside.There isn’t anybody in the buggy at all.Aunt Lucy says, “Oh!” in a real loud voice and then faints. I had to carry herback to the house and get her into bed.I waited almost all night by the window, but Uncle Fred and Cousin Osborne nevershowed up. Never.The next few days was awful. They was nothing in the buggy for a clue like towhat happened, and Aunt Lucy wouldn’t let me go along the road into town or evento the station through the woods.The next morning the horse was dead in the barn, and of course we would of hadto walk to the deepo or all those miles to Warren’s farm. Aunt Lucy was scaredto go and scared to stay and she allowed as how when Cap Pritchett comes by wehad best go with him over to town and make a report and then stay there until wefound out what happened.Me, I had my own ideas what happened. Halloween was only a few days away now,and maybe them ones had snatched Uncle Fred and Cousin Osborne for sacrefice.Them ones or the Druids. The mythology book said Druids could even raise stormsif they wanted to with their spells.No sense talking to Aunt Lucy, though. She was like out of her head with worry,anyway, just rocking back and forth and mumbling over and over, “They’re gone”and “Fred always warned me” and “No use, no use.” I had to get the meals andtend to stock myself. And nights it was hard to sleep, because I kep listeningfor drums. I never heard any, though, but still it was better than sleeping andhaving those dreams.Dreams about the black thing like a tree, walking through the woods and sort ofrooting itself to one particular spot so it could pray with all thosemouths—pray down to that old god in the ground below.I don’t know where I got the idea that was how it prayed—by sort of attachingits mouths to the ground. Maybe it was on account of seeing the green slime. Orhad I really seen it? I’d never gone back to look. Maybe it was all in myhead—the Druid story and about them ones and the voice that said “shoggoth” andall the rest.But then, where was Cousin Osborne and Uncle Fred? And what scared the horse soit up and died the next day?Thoughts kep going round and round in my head, chasing each other, but all Iknew was we’d be out of here by Halloween night.Because Halloween was on a Thursday, and Cap Pritchett would come and we couldride to town with him.Night before I made Aunt Lucy pack and we got all ready, and then I settled downto sleep. There was no noises, and for the first time I felt a little better.Only the dreams come again. I dreamed a bunch of men come in the night andcrawled through the parlor bedroom window where Aunt Lucy slept and got her.They tied her up and took her away, all quiet, in the dark, because they hadcat-eyes and didn’t need light to see.The dream scared me so I woke up while it was just breaking into dawn. I wentdown the hall to Aunt Lucy right away.She was gone.The window was wide open like in my dream, and some of the blankets was torn.Ground was hard outside the window and I didn’t see footprints or anything. Butshe was gone.I guess I cried then.It’s hard to remember what I did next. Didn’t want breakfast. Went out hollering“Aunt Lucy” and not expecting any answer. I walked to the barn and the door wasopen and the cows were gone. Saw one or two prints going out the yard and up theroad, but I didn’t think it was safe to follow them.Some time later I went over to the well and then I cried again because the waterwas all slimy green in the new one, just like the old.When I saw that I knew I was right. Them ones must of come in the night and theywasn’t even trying to hide their doings any more. Like they was sure of things.Tonight was Halloween. I had to get out of here. If them ones was watching andwaiting, I couldn’t depend on Cap Pritchett showing up this afternoon. I’d haveto chance it down the road and I’d better start walking now, in the morning,while it was still light enough to make town.So I rummaged around and found a little money in Uncle Fred’s drawer of thebureau and Cousin Osborne’s letter with the address in Kingsport he wrote itfrom. That’s where I’d have to go after I told folks in town what happened. I’dhave some kin there.I wondered if they’d believe me in town when I told them about the way UncleFred had disappeared and Aunt Lucy, and about them stealing the cattle for asacrefice and about the green slime in the well where something had stopped todrink. I wondered if they would know about the drums and the lights on the hillstonight and if they was going to get up a party and come back this evening totry and catch them ones and what they meant to call up rumbling out of theearth. I wondered if they knew what a “shoggoth” was.Well, whether they did or not, I couldn’t stay and find out for myself. So Ipacked up my satchel and got ready to leave. Must of been around noon andeverything was still.I went to the door and stepped outside, not bothering to lock it behind me. Whyshould I with nobody around for miles?Then I heard the noise down the road.Footsteps.Somebody walking along the road, just around the bend.I stood still for a minute, waiting to see, waiting to run.Then he come along.He was tall and thin, and looked something like Uncle Fred only a lot youngerand without a beard, and he was wearing a nice city kind of suit and a crushhat. He smiled when he saw me and come marching up like he knowed who I was.“Hello, Willie,” he said.I didn’t say nothing, I was so confuzed.“Don’t you know me?” he said. “I’m Cousin Osborne. Your Cousin Frank.” He heldout his hand to shake. “But then I guess you wouldn’t remember, would you? Lasttime I saw you, you were only a baby.”“But I thought you were suppose to come last week,” I said. “We expected you onthe 25th.”“Didn’t you get my telegram?” he asked. “I had business.”I shook my head. “We never get nothing here unless the mail delivers it onThursdays. Maybe it’s at the station.”Cousin Osborne grinned. “You are pretty well off the beaten track at that.Nobody at the station this noon. I was hoping Fred would come along with thebuggy so I wouldn’t have to walk, but no luck.”“You walked all the way?” I asked.“That’s right.”“And you come on the train?”Cousin Osborne nodded.“Then where’s your suitcase?”“I left it at the deepo,” he told me. “Too far to fetch it along. I thought Fredwould drive me back there in the buggy to pick it up.” He noticed my luggage forthe first time. “But wait a minute—where are you going with a suitcase, son?”Well, there was nothing else for me to do but tell him everything that happened.So I said for him to come into the house and set down and I’d explain.We went back in and he fixed some coffee and I made a couple sanwiches and weate, and then I told him about Uncle Fred going to the deepo and not comingback, and about the horse and then what happened to Aunt Lucy. I left out thepart about me in the woods, of course, and I didn’t even hint at them ones. ButI told him I was scared and figgered on walking to town today before dark.Cousin Osborne he listened to me, nodding and not saying much or interrupting.“Now you can see why we got to go, right away,” I said. “Whatever come afterthem will be coming after us, and I don’t want to spend another night here.”Cousin Osborne stood up. “You may be right, Willie,” he said. “But don’t letyour imagination run away with you, son. Try to separate fact from fancy. YourAunt and Uncle have disappeared. That’s fact. But this other nonsense aboutthings in the woods coming after you—that’s fancy. Reminds me of all that sillytalk I heard back home, in Arkham. And for some reason there seems to be more ofit around this time of year, at Halloween. Why, when I left—”“Excuse me, Cousin Osborne,” I said. “But don’t you live in Kingsport?”“Why to be sure,” he told me. “But I did live in Arkham once, and I know thepeople around here. It’s no wonder you were so frightened in the woods and gotto imagining things. As it is, I admire your bravery. For a 12 year old, you’veacted very sensibly.”“Then let’s start walking,” I said. “Here it is almost 2 and we better getmoving if we want to make town before sundown.”“Not just yet, son,” Cousin Osborne said. “I wouldn’t feel right about leavingwithout looking around and seeing what we can discover about this mystery. Afterall, you must understand that we can’t just march into town and tell the sheriffsome wild nonsense about strange creatures in the woods making off with yourAunt and Uncle. Sensible folks just won’t believe such things. They might thinkI was lying and laugh at me. Why they might even think you had something to dowith your Aunt and Uncle’s—well, leaving.”“Please,” I said. “We got to go, right now.”He shook his head.I didn’t say any more. I might of told him a lot, about what I dreamed and heardand saw and knew—but I figgered it was no use.Besides, there was some things I didn’t want to say to him now that I had talkedto him. I was feeling scared again.First he said he was from Arkham and then when I asked him he said he was fromKingsport but it sounded like a lie to me.Then he said something about me being scared in the woods and how could he knowthat? I never told him that part at all.If you want to know what I really thought, I thought maybe he wasn’t reallyCousin Osborne at all.And if he wasn’t, then—who was he?I stood up and walked back into the hall.“Where you going, son?” he asked.“Outside.”“I’ll come with you.”Sure enough, he was watching me. He wasn’t going to let me out of his sight. Hecame over and took my arm, real friendly—but I couldn’t break loose. No, he hungon to me. He knew I meant to run for it.What could I do? All alone in the house in the woods with this man, with nightcoming on, Halloween night, and them ones out there waiting.We went outside and I noticed it was getting darker already, even in afternoon.Clouds had covered up the sun, and the wind was moving the trees so theystretched out their branches, like they was trying to hold me back. They made arustling noise, just as if they were whispering things about me, and he sort oflooked up at them and listened. Maybe he understood what they were saying. Maybethey were giving him orders.Then I almost laughed, because he was listening to something and now I heard it,too.It was a drumming sound, on the road.“Cap Pritchett,” I said. “He’s the mailman. Now we can ride to town with him inthe buggy.”“Let me talk to him,” he says. “About your Aunt and Uncle. No sense in alarminghim, and we don’t want any scandal, do we? You just run along inside.”“But Cousin Osborne,” I said. “We got to tell the truth.”“Of course, son. But this is a matter for adults. Now run along. I’ll call you.”He was real polite about it and even smiled, but all the same he dragged me backup the porch and into the house and slammed the door. I stood there in the darkhall and I could hear Cap Pritchett slow down and call out to him, and him goingup to the buggy and talking, and then all I heard was a lot of mumbling, reallow. I peeked out through a crack in the door and saw them. Cap Pritchett wastalking to him friendly, all right, and nothing was wrong.Except that in a minute or so, Cap Pritchett waved and then he grabbed the reinsand the buggy started off again!Then I knew I’d have to do it, no matter what happened. I opened the door andran out, suitcase and all, down the path and up the road after the buggy. CousinOsborne he tried to grab me when I went by, but I ducked around him and yelled,“Wait for me, Cap—I’m coming—take me to town!”Cap slowed down and stared back, real puzzled. “Willie!” he says. “Why I thoughtyou was gone. He said you went away with Fred and Lucy—”“Pay no attention,” I said. “He didn’t want me to go. Take me to town. I’ll tellyou what really happened. Please, Cap, you got to take me.”“Sure I’ll take you, Willie. Hop right up here.”I hopped.Cousin Osborne come right up to the buggy. “Here, now,” he said, real sharp.“You can’t leave like this. I forbid it. You’re in my custody.”“Don’t listen to him,” I yelled. “Take me, Cap. Please!”“Very well,” said Cousin Osborne. “If you insist on being unreasonable. We’llall go. I cannot permit you to leave alone.”He smiled at Cap. “You can see the boy is unstrung,” he said. “And I trust youwill not be disturbed by his imaginings. Living out here like this—well, youunderstand—he’s not quite himself. I’ll explain everything on the way to town.”He sort of shrugged at Cap and made signs of tapping his head. Then he smiledagain and made to climb up next to us in the buggy seat.But Cap didn’t smile back. “No, you don’t,” he said. “This boy Willie is a goodboy. I know him. I don’t know you. Looks as if you done enough explainingalready, Mister, when you said Willie had gone away.”“But I merely wanted to avoid talk—you see, I’ve been called in to doctor theboy—he’s mentally unstable—”“Stables be damned!” Cap spit out some tobacco juice right at Cousin Osborne’sfeet. “We’re going.”Cousin Osborne stopped smiling. “Then I insist you take me with you,” he said.And he tried to climb into the buggy.Cap reached into his jacket and when he pulled his hand out again he had a bigpistol in it.“Git down!” he yelled. “Mister, you’re talking to the United States Mail and youdon’t tell the Government nothing, understand? Now git down before I mess yourbrains all over this road.”Cousin Osborne scowled, but he got away from the buggy, fast.He looked at me and shrugged. “You’re making a big mistake, Willie,” he said.I didn’t even look at him. Cap said, “Gee up,” and we went off down the road.The buggy wheels turned faster and faster and pretty soon the farmhouse was outof sight and Cap put his pistol away, and patted me on the shoulder.“Stop that trembling, Willie,” he said. “You’re safe now. Nothing to worryabout. Be in town little over an hour or so. Now you just set back and tell oldCap all about it.”So I told him. It took a long time. We kep going through the woods, and before Iknew it, it was almost dark. The sun sneaked down and hid behind the hills. Thedark began to creep out of the woods on each side of the road, and the treesstarted to rustle, whispering to the big shadows that followed us.The horse was clipping and clopping along, and pretty soon they were othernoises from far away. Might have been thunder and might have been somethingelse. But it was getting night-time for sure, and it was the night of Halloween.The road cut off through the hills now, and you could hardly see where the nextturn would take you. Besides, it was getting dark awful fast.“Guess we’re in for a spell of rain,” Cap said, looking up. “That’s thunder, Ireckon.”“Drums,” I said.“Drums?”“At night in the hills you can hear them,” I told him. “I heard them all thismonth. It’s them ones, getting ready for the Sabbath.”“Sabbath?” Cap looked at me. “Where you hear tell about a Sabbath?”Then I told him some more about what had happened. I told him all the rest. Hedidn’t say anything, and before long he couldn’t of answered me anyway, becausethe thunder was all around us, and the rain was lashing down on the buggy, onthe road, everywhere. It was pitch-black outside now, and the only time we couldsee was when lightning flashed. I had to yell to make him hear me—yell about thethings that caught Uncle Fred and come for Aunt Lucy, the things that took ourcattle and then sent Cousin Osborne back to fetch me. I hollered out about whatI heard in the wood, too.In the lightning flashes I could see Cap’s face. He wasn’t smiling orscowling—he just looked like he believed me. And I noticed he had his pistol outagain and was holding the reins with one hand even though we were racing along.The horse was so scared he didn’t need the whip to keep him running.The old buggy was lurching and bouncing, and the rain was whistling down in thewind and it was all like an awful dream but it was real. It was real when Ihollered out to Cap Pritchett about that time in the woods.“Shoggoth,” I yelled. “What’s a shoggoth?”Cap grabbed my arm, and then the lightning come and I could see his face, withhis mouth open. But he wasn’t looking at me. He was looking at the road and whatwas ahead of us.The trees sort of come together, hanging over the next turn, and in the black itlooked as if they were alive—moving and bending and twisting to block our way.Lightning flickered up again and I could see them plain, and also somethingelse.Something black in the road, something that wasn’t a tree. Something big andblack, just squatting there, waiting, with ropy arms squirming and reaching.“Shoggoth!” Cap yelled. But I could scarcely hear him because the thunder wasroaring and now the horse let out a scream and I felt the buggy jerk to one sideand the horse reared up and we was almost into the black stuff. I could smell anawful smell, and Cap was pointing his pistol and it went off with a bang thatwas almost as loud as the thunder and almost as loud as the sound we made whenwe hit the black thing.Then everything happened at once. The thunder, the horse falling, the shot, andus hitting as the buggy went over. Cap must of had the reins wrapped around hisarm, because when the horse fell and the buggy turned over, he went right overthe dashboard head first and down into the squirming mess that was the horse—andthe black thing that grabbed it. I felt myself falling in the dark, then landingin the mud and gravel of the road.There was thunder and screaming and another sound which I had heard only oncebefore in the woods—a droning sound like a voice.That’s why I never looked back. That’s why I didn’t even think about being hurtwhen I landed—just got up and started to run down the road, fast as I could, rundown the road in the storm and the dark with the trees squirming and twistingand shaking their heads while they pointed at me with their branches andlaughed.Over the thunder I heard the horse scream and I heard Cap scream, too, but Istill didn’t look back. The lightning winked on and off, and I ran through thetrees now because the road was nothing but mud that dragged me down and suckedat my legs. After a while I began to scream, too, but I couldn’t even hearmyself for thunder. And more than thunder. I heard drums.All at once I busted clear of the woods and got to the hills. I ran up, and thedrumming got louder, and pretty soon I could see regular, not just when they waslightning. Because they was fires burning on the hill, and the booming of thedrums come from there.I got lost in the noise; the wind shrieking and the trees laughing and the drumspounding. But I stopped in time. I stopped when I saw the fires plain; red andgreen fires burning in all that rain.I saw a big white stone in the center of a cleared-off space on top of the hill.The red and green fires was around and behind it, so everything stood out clearagainst the flames.They was men around the alter, men with long gray beards and wrinkled-up faces,men throwing awful-smelling stuff on the fires to make them blaze red and green.And they had knives in their hands and I could hear them howling over the storm.In back, squatting on the ground, more men pounded on drums.Pretty soon something else come up the hill—two men driving cattle. I could tellit was our cows they drove, drove them right up to the alter and then the menwith the knives cut their throats for a sacrefice.All this I could see in lightning flashes and in the fire lights, and I sort ofscooched down so I couldn’t get spotted by anyone.But pretty soon I couldn’t see very good any more, on account of the way theythrew stuff on the fire. It set up a real thick black smoke. When this smokecome up, the men began to chant and pray louder.I couldn’t hear words, but the sounds was like what I heard back in the woods. Icouldn’t see too good, but I knew what was going to happen. Two men who had ledthe cattle went back down the other side of the hill and when they come up againthey had new sacrefices. The smoke kep me from seeing plain, but these wastwo-legged sacrefices, not four. I might of seen better at that, only now I hidmy face when they dragged them up to the white alter and used the knives, andthe fire and smoke flared up and the drums boomed and they all chanted andcalled in a loud voice to something waiting over on the other side of the hill.The ground began to shake. It was storming, they was thunder and lightning andfire and smoke and chanting and I was scared half out of my wits, but one thingI’ll swear to—the ground began to shake. It shook and shivered and they calledout to something, and in a minute something came.It came crawling up the hillside to the alter and the sacrefice, and it was theblack thing of my dreams—that black, ropy, slimy jelly tree-thing out of thewoods. It crawled up and it flowed up on its hoofs and mouths and snaky arms.And the men bowed and stood back and then it got to the alter where they wassomething squirming on top, squirming and screaming.The black thing sort of bent over the alter and then I heard droning sounds overthe screaming as it come down. I only watched a minute, but while I watched theblack thing began to swell and grow.That finished me. I didn’t care any more. I had to run. I got up and I run andrun and run, screaming at the top of my lungs no matter who heard.I kep running and I kep screaming forever, through the woods and the storm, awayfrom that hill and that alter, and then all at once I knew where I was and I wasback here at the farmhouse.Yes, that’s what I’d done—run in a circle and come back. But I couldn’t go anyfurther, I couldn’t stand the night and the storm. So I run inside here. Atfirst after I locked the door I just lay right down on the floor, all tuckeredout from running and crying.But in a little while I got up and hunted me some nails and a hammer and some ofUncle Fred’s boards that wasn’t split up into kindling.I nailed up the door first and then boarded up all the windows. Every last oneof them. Guess I worked for hours, tired as I was. When it was all done, thestorm died down and it got quiet. Quiet enough for me to lie down on the couchand go to sleep.Woke up a couple of hours ago. It was daylight. I could see it shining throughthe cracks. From the way the sun come in, I knew it was afternoon already. I’dslept through the whole morning, and nothing had come.I figured now maybe I could let myself out and make town on foot, like I’dplanned yesterday.But I figgered wrong.Before I got started taking out the nails, I heard him. It was Cousin Osborne,of course. The man who said he was Cousin Osborne, I mean.He come into the yard, calling “Willie!” but I didn’t answer. Then he tried thedoor and then the windows. I could hear him pounding and cussing. That was bad.But then he began mumbling, and that was worse. Because it meant he wasn’t outthere alone.I sneaked a look through the crack, but he already went around to the back ofthe house so I didn’t see him or who was with him.Guess that’s just as well, because if I’m right, I wouldn’t want to see.Hearing’s bad enough.Hearing that deep croaking, and then him talking, and then that croaking again.Smelling that awful smell, like the green slime from the woods and around thewell.The well—they went over to the well in back. And I heard Cousin Osborne saysomething about, “Wait until dark. We can use the well if you find the gate.Look for the gate.”I know what that means now. The well must be a sort of entrance to theunderground place—that’s where those Druid men live. And the black thing.They’re out in back now, looking.I been writing for quite a spell and already the afternoon is going. Peekingthrough the cracks I can see it’s getting dark again.That’s when they’ll come for me—when it’s dark.They’ll break down the doors or the windows and come and take me. They’ll takeme down into the well, into the black places where the shoggoths are. There mustbe a whole world down under the hills, a world where they hide and wait to comeout for more sacrefices, more blood. They don’t want any humans around, exceptfor sacrefices.I saw what the black thing did on the alter. I know what’s going to happen tome.Maybe they’ll miss the real Cousin Osborne back home and send somebody to findout what become of him. Maybe folks in town will miss Cap Pritchett and go on asearch. Maybe they’ll come here and find me. But if they don’t come soon it willbe too late.That’s why I wrote this. It’s true, cross my heart, every word of it. And ifanyone finds this notebook where I hide it, come and look down the well. The oldwell, out in back.Remember what I told about them ones. Block up the well and clean out themswamps. No sense looking for me—if I’m not here.I wish I wasn’t so scared. I’m not even scared so much for myself, but for otherfolks. The ones who might come after and live around here and have the samething happen—or worse.You just got to believe me. Go to the woods if you don’t. Go to the hill. Thehill where they had the sacrefice. Maybe the stains are gone and the rain washedthe footprints away. Maybe they got rid of the traces of the fire. But the alterstone must be there. And if it is, you’ll know the truth. There should be somebig round spots on that stone. Round spots about two feet wide.I didn’t tell about that. At the last, I did look back. I looked back at the bigblack thing that was a shoggoth. I looked back as it kep swelling and growing. Iguess I told about how it could change shape, and how big it got. But you can’thardly imagine how big or what shape and I still dassn’t tell.All I say is look. Look and you’ll see what’s hiding under the earth in thesehills, waiting to creep out and feast and kill some more.Wait. They’re coming now. Getting twilight and I can hear footsteps. And othersounds. Voices. And other sounds. They’re banging on the door. And sureenough—they must have a tree or a plank to use for battering it down. The wholeplace is shaking. I can hear Cousin Osborne yelling, and that droning. The smellis awful, I’m getting sick, and in a minute—Look at the alter. Then you’ll understand what I’m trying to tell. Look at thebig round marks, two feet wide, on each side. That’s where the big black thinggrabbed hold.Look for the marks and you’ll know what I saw, what I’m afraid of, what’swaiting to grab you unless you shut it up forever under the earth.Black marks two feet wide, but they aren’t just marks.What they really are is fingerprints!The door is busting o——* Originally published in Weird Tales, May 1951."},{"pageContent":"THE SALEM HORROR*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]HENRY KUTTNER[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]When Carson first noticed the sounds in his cellar, he ascribed them to therats. Later he began to hear the tales which were whispered by the superstitiousPolish mill workers in Derby Street regarding the first occupant of the ancienthouse, Abigail Prinn. There was none living today who could remember thediabolical old hag, but the morbid legends which thrive in the “witch district”of Salem like rank weeds on a neglected grave gave disturbing particulars of heractivities, and were unpleasantly explicit regarding the detestable sacrificesshe was known to have made to a worm-eaten, crescent-horned image of dubiousorigin. The oldsters still muttered of Abbie Prinn and her monstrous boasts thatshe was high priestess of a fearfully potent god which dwelt deep in the hills.Indeed, it was the old witch’s reckless boasting which had led to her abrupt andmysterious death in 1692, about the time of the famous hangings on Gallows Hill.No one liked to talk about it, but occasionally a toothless crone would mumblefearfully that the flames could not burn her, for her whole body had taken onthe peculiar anesthesia of her witch-mark.Abbie Prinn and her anomalous statue had long since vanished, but it was stilldifficult to find tenants for her decrepit, gabled house, with its overhangingsecond story and curious diamond-paned casement windows. The house’s evilnotoriety had spread throughout Salem. Nothing had actually happened there ofrecent years which might give rise to the inexplicable tales, but those whorented the house had a habit of moving out hastily, generally with vague andunsatisfactory explanations connected with the rats.And it was a rat which led Carson to the Witch Room. The squealing and muffledpattering within the rotting walls had disturbed Carson more than once duringthe nights of his first week in the house, which he had rented to obtain thesolitude that would enable him to complete a novel for which his publishers hadbeen asking—another light romance to add to Carson’s long string of popularsuccesses. But it was not until sometime later that he began to entertaincertain wildly fantastic surmises regarding the intelligence of the rat thatscurried from under his feet in the dark hallway one evening.The house had been wired for electricity, but the bulb in the hall was small andgave a dim light. The rat was a misshapen, black shadow as it darted a few feetaway and paused, apparently watching him.At another time Carson might have dismissed the animal with a threateninggesture and returned to his work. But the traffic on Derby Street had beenunusually noisy, and he had found it difficult to concentrate upon his novel.His nerves, for no apparent reason, were taut; and somehow it seemed that therat, watching just beyond his reach, was eyeing him with sardonic amusement.Smiling at the conceit, he took a few steps toward the rat, and it rushed awayto the cellar door, which he saw with surprise was ajar. He must have neglectedto close it the last time he had been in the cellar, although he generally tookcare to keep the doors shut, for the ancient house was drafty. The rat waited inthe doorway.Unreasonably annoyed, Carson hurried forward, sending the rat scurrying down thestairway. He switched on the cellar light and observed the rat in a corner. Itwatched him keenly out of glittering little eyes.As he descended the stairs he could not help feeling that he was acting like afool. But his work had been tiring, and subconsciously he welcomed anyinterruption. He moved across the cellar to the rat, seeing with astonishmentthat the creature remained unmoving, staring at him. A strange feeling ofuneasiness began to grow within him. The rat was acting abnormally, he felt; andthe unwinking gaze of its cold shoe-button eyes was somehow disturbing.Then he laughed to himself, for the rat had suddenly whisked aside anddisappeared into a little hole in the cellar wall. Idly he scratched a crosswith his toe in the dirt before the burrow, deciding that he would set a trapthere in the morning.The rat’s snout and ragged whiskers protruded cautiously. It moved forward andthen hesitated, drew back. Then the animal began to act in a singular andunaccountable manner—almost as though it were dancing, Carson thought. It movedtentatively forward, retreated again. It would give a little dart forward and bebrought up short, then leap back hastily, as though—the simile flashed intoCarson’s mind—a snake were coiled before the burrow, alert to prevent the rat’sescape. But there was nothing there save the little cross Carson had scratchedin the dust.No doubt it was Carson himself who blocked the rat’s escape, for he was standingwithin a few feet of the burrow. He moved forward, and the animal hurriedlyretreated out of sight.His interest piqued, Carson found a stick and poked it exploringly into thehole. As he did so his eye, close to the wall, detected something strange aboutthe stone slab just above the rat burrow. A quick glance around its edgeconfirmed his suspicion. The slab was apparently movable.Carson examined it closely, noticed a depression on its edge which would afforda handhold. His fingers fitted easily into the groove, and he pulledtentatively. The stone moved a trifle and stopped. He pulled harder, and with asprinkling of dry earth the slab swung away from the wall as though on hinges.A black rectangle, shoulder-high, gaped in the wall. From its depths a musty,unpleasant stench of dead air welled out, and involuntarily Carson retreated astep. Suddenly he remembered the monstrous tales of Abbie Prinn and the hideoussecrets she was supposed to have kept hidden in her house. Had he stumbled uponsome hidden retreat of the long-dead witch?Before entering the dark gap he took the precaution of obtaining a flashlightfrom upstairs. Then he cautiously bent his head and stepped into the narrow,evil-smelling passage, sending the flashlight’s beam probing out before him.He was in a narrow tunnel, scarcely higher than his head, and walled and pavedwith stone slabs. It ran straight ahead for perhaps fifteen feet, and thenbroadened out into a roomy chamber. As Carson stepped into the undergroundroom—no doubt a hidden retreat of Abbie Prinn’s, a hiding-place, he thought,which nevertheless could not save her on the day the fright-crazed mob had comeraging along Derby Street—he caught his breath in a gasp of amazement. The roomwas fantastic, astonishing.It was the floor which held Carson’s gaze. The dull gray of the circular wallgave place here to a mosaic of varicolored stone, in which blues and greens andpurples predominated—indeed, there were none of the warmer colors. There musthave been thousands of bits of colored stone making up that pattern, for nonewas larger than a walnut. And the mosaic seemed to follow some definite pattern,unfamiliar to Carson; there were curves of purple and violet mingled with angledlines of green and blue, intertwining in fantastic arabesques. There werecircles, triangles, a pentagram, and other, less familiar, figures. Most of thelines and figures radiated from a definite point: the center of the chamber,where there was a circular disk of dead black stone perhaps two feet indiameter.It was very silent. The sounds of the cars that occasionally went past overheadin Derby Street could not be heard. In a shallow alcove in the wall Carsoncaught a glimpse of markings on the walls, and he moved slowly in thatdirection, the beam of his light traveling up and down the walls of the niche.The marks, whatever they were, had been daubed upon the stone long ago, for whatwas left of the cryptic symbols was indecipherable. Carson saw several partlyeffaced hieroglyphics which reminded him of Arabic, but he could not be sure. Onthe floor of the alcove was a corroded metal disk about eight feet in diameter,and Carson received the distinct impression that it was movable. But thereseemed no way to lift it.He became conscious that he was standing in the exact center of the chamber, inthe circle of black stone where the odd design centered. Again he noticed theutter silence. On an impulse he clicked off the ray of his flashlight. Instantlyhe was in dead blackness.At that moment a curious idea entered his mind. He pictured himself at thebottom of a pit, and from above a flood was descending, pouring down the shaftto engulf him. So strong was this impression that he actually fancied he couldhear a muffled thundering, the roar of the cataract. Then, oddly shaken, heclicked on the light, glanced around swiftly. The drumming, of course, was thepounding of his blood, made audible in the complete silence—a familiarphenomenon. But, if the place was so still—The thought leaped into his mind, as though suddenly thrust into hisconsciousness. This would be an ideal place to work. He could have the placewired for electricity, have a table and chair brought down, use an electric fanif necessary—although the musty odor he had first noticed seemed to havedisappeared completely. He moved to the tunnel mouth, and as he stepped from theroom he felt an inexplicable relaxation of his muscles, although he had notrealized that they had been contracted. He ascribed it to nervousness, and wentupstairs to brew black coffee and write to his landlord in Boston about hisdiscovery.The visitor stared curiously about the hallway after Carson had opened the door,nodding to himself as though with satisfaction. He was a lean, tall figure of aman, with thick steel-gray eyebrows overhanging keen gray eyes. His face,although strongly marked and gaunt, was unwrinkled.“About the Witch Room, I suppose?” Carson said ungraciously. His landlord hadtalked, and for the last week he had been unwillingly entertaining antiquariesand occultists anxious to glimpse the secret chamber in which Abbie Prinn hadmumbled her spells. Carson’s annoyance had grown, and he had considered movingto a quieter place; but his inherent stubbornness had made him stay on,determined to finish his novel in spite of interruptions. Now, eyeing his guestcoldly, he said, “I’m sorry, but it’s not on exhibition anymore.”The other looked startled, but almost immediately a gleam of comprehension cameinto his eyes. He extracted a card and offered it to Carson.“Michael Leigh … occultist, eh?” Carson repeated. He drew a deep breath. Theoccultists, he had found, were the worst, with their dark hints of namelessthings and their profound interest in the mosaic pattern on the floor of theWitch Room. “I’m sorry, Mr. Leigh, but—I’m really quite busy. You’ll excuse me.”Ungraciously he turned back to the door.“Just a moment,” Leigh said swiftly.Before Carson could protest he had caught the writer by the shoulders and waspeering closely into his eyes. Startled, Carson drew back, but not before he hadseen an extraordinary expression of mingled apprehension and satisfaction appearon Leigh’s gaunt face. It was as though the occultist had seen somethingunpleasant—but not unexpected.“What’s the idea?” Carson asked harshly. “I’m not accustomed—”“I’m very sorry,” Leigh said. His voice was deep, pleasant. “I must apologize. Ithought—well, again I apologize. I’m rather excited, I’m afraid. You see, I’vecome from San Francisco to see this Witch Room of yours. Would you really mindletting me see it? I should be glad to pay any sum—”Carson made a deprecatory gesture.“No,” he said, feeling a perverse liking for this man growing within him—hiswell-modulated, pleasant voice, his powerful face, his magnetic personality.“No, I merely want a little peace—you have no idea how I’ve been bothered,” hewent on, vaguely surprised to find himself speaking apologetically. “It’s afrightful nuisance. I almost wish I’d never found the room.”Leigh leaned forward anxiously. “May I see it? It means a great deal to me—I’mvitally interested in these things. I promise not to take up more than tenminutes of your time.”Carson hesitated, then assented. As he led his guest into the cellar he foundhimself telling the circumstances of his discovery of the Witch Room. Leighlistened intently, occasionally interrupting with questions.“The rat—did you see what became of it?” he asked.Carson looked bemused. “Why, no. I suppose it hid in its burrow. Why?”“One never knows,” Leigh said cryptically as they came into the Witch Room.Carson switched on the light. He had had an electrical extension installed, andthere were a few chairs and a table, but otherwise, the chamber was unchanged.Carson watched the occultist’s face, and with surprise saw it become grim,almost angry.Leigh strode to the center of the room, staring at the chair that stood on theblack circle of stone.“You work here?” he asked slowly.“Yes. It’s quiet—I found I couldn’t work upstairs. Too noisy. But this isideal—somehow I find it very easy to write here. My mind feels”—hehesitated—“free; that is, disassociated with other things. It’s quite an unusualfeeling.”Leigh nodded as though Carson’s words had confirmed some idea in his own mind.He turned toward the alcove and the metal disk in the floor. Carson followedhim. The occultist moved close to the wall, tracing out the faded symbols with along forefinger. He muttered something under his breath—words that sounded likegibberish to Carson.“Nyogtha … k’yarnak …”He swung about, his face grim and pale. “I’ve seen enough,” he said softly.“Shall we go?”Surprised, Carson nodded and led the way back into the cellar.Upstairs Leigh hesitated, as though finding it difficult to broach his subject.At length he asked, “Mr. Carson—would you mind telling me if you have had anypeculiar dreams lately.”Carson stared at him, mirth dancing in his eyes. “Dreams?” he repeated. “Oh—Isee. Well, Mr. Leigh, I may as well tell you that you can’t frighten me. Yourcompatriots—the other occultists I’ve entertained—have already tried it.”Leigh raised his thick eyebrows. “Yes? Did they ask you whether you’d dreamed?”“Several did—yes.”“And you told them?”“No.” Then as Leigh leaned back in his chair, a puzzled expression on his face,Carson went on slowly, “Although, really, I’m not quite sure.”“You mean?”“I think—I have a vague impression—that I have dreamed lately. But I can’t besure. I can’t remember anything of the dream, you see. And—oh, very probablyyour brother occultists put the idea into my mind!”“Perhaps,” Leigh said non-committally, getting up. He hesitated. “Mr. Carson,I’m going to ask you a rather presumptuous question. Is it necessary for you tolive in this house?”Carson sighed resignedly. “When I was first asked that question I explained thatI wanted a quiet place to work on a novel, and that any quiet place would do.But it isn’t easy to find ’em. Now that I have this Witch Room, and I’m turningout my work so easily, I see no reason why I should move and perhaps upset myprogram. I’ll vacate this house when I finish my novel, and then you occultistscan come in and turn it into a museum or do whatever you want with it. I don’tcare. But until the novel is finished I intend to stay here.”Leigh rubbed his chin. “Indeed. I can understand your point of view. But—isthere no other place in the house where you can work?”He watched Carson’s face for a moment, and then went on swiftly.“I don’t expect you to believe me. You are a materialist. Most people are. Butthere are a few of us who know that above and beyond what men call science thereis a greater science that is built on laws and principles which to the averageman would be almost incomprehensible. If you have read Machen you will rememberthat he speaks of the gulf between the world of consciousness and the world ofmatter. It is possible to bridge that gulf. The Witch Room is such a bridge! Doyou know what a whispering-gallery is?”“Eh?” Carson said, staring. “But there’s no—”“An analogy—merely an analogy. A man may whisper a word in a gallery—or acave—and if you are standing in a certain spot a hundred feet away you will hearthat whisper, although someone ten feet away will not. It’s a simple trick ofacoustics—bringing the sound to a focal point. And this principle can be appliedto other things besides sound. To any wave impulse—even to thought!”Carson tried to interrupt, but Leigh kept on.“That black stone in the center of your Witch Room is one of those focal points.The design on the floor—when you sit on the black circle there you areabnormally sensitive to certain vibrations—certain thought commands—dangerouslysensitive! Why do you suppose your mind is so clear when you are working there?A deception, a false feeling of lucidity—for you are merely an instrument, amicrophone, tuned to pick up certain malign vibrations the nature of which youcould not comprehend!”Carson’s face was a study in amazement and incredulity. “But—you don’t mean youactually believe—”Leigh drew back, the intensity fading from his eyes, leaving them grim and cold.“Very well. But I have studied the history of your Abigail Prinn. She, too,understood the super-science of which I speak. She used it for evil purposes—theblack art, as it is called. I have read that she cursed Salem in the olddays—and a witch’s curse can be a frightful thing. Will you—” He got up, gnawingat his lip. “Will you, at least, allow me to call on you tomorrow?”Almost involuntarily Carson nodded. “But I’m afraid you’ll be wasting your time.I don’t believe—I mean, I have no—” He stumbled, at a loss for words.“I merely wish to assure myself that you—oh, another thing. If you dreamtonight, will you try to remember the dream? If you attempt to recapture itimmediately after waking, it is often possible to recall it.”“All right. If I dream—”That night Carson dreamed. He awoke just before dawn with his heart racingfuriously and a curious feeling of uneasiness. Within the walls and from belowhe could hear the furtive scurryings of the rats. He got out of bed hastily,shivering in the cold grayness of early morning. A wan moon still shone faintlyin a paling sky.Then he remembered Leigh’s words. He had dreamed—there was no question of that.But the content of his dream—that was another matter. He absolutely could notrecall it to his mind, much as he tried, although there was a very vagueimpression of running frantically in darkness.He dressed quickly, and because the stillness of early morning in the old housegot on his nerves, went out to buy a newspaper. It was too early for shops to beopen, however, and in search of a news-boy he set off westward, turning at thefirst corner. And as he walked a curious and inexplicable feeling began to takepossession of him: a feeling of—familiarity! He had walked here before, andthere was a dim and disturbing familiarity about the shapes of the houses, theoutline of the roofs. But—and this was the fantastic part of it—to his knowledgehe had never been on this street before. He had spent little time walking aboutthis region of Salem, for he was indolent by nature; yet there was thisextraordinary feeling of remembrance, and it grew more vivid as he went on.He reached a corner, turned unthinkingly to the left. The odd sensationincreased. He walked on slowly, pondering.No doubt he had traveled by this way before—and very probably he had done so ina brown study, so that he had not been conscious of his route. Undoubtedly thatwas the explanation. Yet as Carson turned into Charter Street he felt a namelessunease waking within him. Salem was rousing; with daylight impassive Polishworkers began to hurry past him toward the mills. An occasional automobile wentby.Before him a crowd was gathered on the sidewalk. He hastened his steps,conscious of a feeling of impending calamity. With an extraordinary sense ofshock he saw that he was passing the Charter Street Burying Ground, the ancient,evilly famous “Burying Point.” Hastily he pushed his way into the crowd.Comments in a muffled undertone came to Carson’s ears, and a bulky blue-cladback loomed up before him. He peered over the policeman’s shoulder and caughthis breath in a horrified gasp.A man leaned against the iron railing that fenced the old graveyard. He wore acheap, gaudy suit, and he gripped the rusty bars in a clutch that made themuscles stand out in ridges on the hairy backs of his hands. He was dead, and onhis face, staring up at the sky at a crazy angle, was frozen an expression ofabysmal and utterly shocking horror. His eyes, all whites, were bulginghideously; his mouth was a twisted, mirthless grin.A man at Carson’s side turned a white face toward him. “Looks as if he wasscared to death,” he said somewhat hoarsely. “I’d hate to have seen what he saw.Ugh—look at that face!”Mechanically Carson backed away, feeling an icy breath of nameless things chillhim. He rubbed his hand across his eyes, but still that contorted, dead faceswam in his vision. He began to retrace his steps, shaken and trembling alittle. Involuntarily his glance moved aside, rested on the tombs and monumentsthat dotted the old graveyard. No one had been buried there for over a century,and the lichen-stained tombstones, with their winged skulls, fat-cheekedcherubs, and funeral urns, seemed to breathe out an indefinable miasma ofantiquity. What had frightened the man to death?Carson drew a deep breath. True, the corpse had been a frightful spectacle, buthe must not allow it to upset his nerves. He could not—his novel would suffer.Besides, he argued grimly to himself, the affair was obvious enough in itsexplanation. The dead man was apparently a Pole, one of the group of immigrantswho dwell about Salem Harbor. Passing by the graveyard at night, a spot aboutwhich eldritch legends had clung for nearly three centuries, his drink-befuddledeyes must have given reality to the hazy phantoms of a superstitious mind. ThesePoles were notoriously unstable emotionally, prone to mob hysteria and wildimaginings. The great Immigrant Panic of 1853, in which three witch-houses hadbeen burned to the ground, had grown from an old woman’s confused and hystericalstatement that she had seen a mysterious white-clad foreigner “take off hisface.” What else could be expected of such people, Carson thought?Nevertheless he remained in a nervous state, and did not return home untilnearly noon. When on his arrival he found Leigh, the occultist, waiting, he wasglad to see the man, and invited him in with cordiality.Leigh was very serious. “Did you hear about your friend Abigail Prinn?” he askedwithout preamble, and Carson stared, pausing in the act of siphoning chargedwater into a glass. After a long moment he pressed the lever, sent the liquidsizzling and foaming into the whiskey. He handed Leigh the drink and took onehimself—neat—before answering the question.“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Has—what’s she been up to?” he asked,with an air of forced levity.“I’ve been checking up the records,” Leigh said, “and I find Abigail Prinn wasburied on December 14th, 1690, in the Charter Street Burying Ground—with a stakethrough her heart. What’s the matter?”“Nothing,” Carson said tonelessly. “Well?”“Well—her grave’s been opened and robbed, that’s all. The stake was founduprooted nearby, and there were footprints all around the grave. Shoe-prints.Did you dream last night, Carson?” Leigh snapped out the question, his gray eyeshard.“I don’t know,” Carson said confusedly, rubbing his forehead. “I can’t remember.I was at the Charter Street graveyard this morning.”“Oh. Then you must have heard something about the man who—”“I saw him,” Carson interrupted, shuddering. “It upset me.”He downed the whiskey at a gulp.Leigh watched him. “Well,” he said presently, “are you still determined to stayin this house?”Carson put down the glass and stood up.“Why not?” he snapped. “Is there any reason why I shouldn’t? Eh?”“After what happened last night—”“After what happened? A grave was robbed. A superstitious Pole saw the robbersand died of fright. Well?”“You’re trying to convince yourself,” Leigh said calmly. “In your heart youknow—you must know—the truth. You’ve become a tool in the hands of tremendousterrible forces, Carson. For three centuries Abbie Prinn has lain in hergrave—undead—waiting for someone to fall into her trap—the Witch Room. Perhapsshe foresaw the future when she built it, foresaw that someday someone wouldblunder into that hellish chamber and be caught by the trap of the mosaicpattern. It caught you, Carson—and enabled that undead horror to bridge the gulfbetween consciousness and matter, to get en rapport with you. Hypnotism ischild’s play to a being with Abigail Prinn’s frightful powers. She could veryeasily force you to go to her grave and uproot the stake that held her captive,and then erase the memory of that act from your mind so that you could notremember it even as a dream!”Carson was on his feet, his eyes burning with a strange light. “In God’s name,man, do you know what you’re saying?”Leigh laughed harshly. “God’s name! The devil’s name, rather—the devil thatmenaces Salem at this moment; for Salem is in danger, terrible danger. The menand women and children of the town Abbie Prinn cursed when they bound her to thestake—and found they couldn’t burn her! I’ve been going through certain secretarchives this morning, and I’ve come to ask you, for the last time, to leavethis house.”“Are you through?” Carson asked coldly. “Very well. I shall stay here. You’reeither insane or drunk, but you can’t impress me with your poppycock.”“Would you leave if I offered you a thousand dollars?” Leigh asked. “Or more,then—ten thousand? I have a considerable sum at my command.”“No, damn it!” Carson snapped in a sudden blaze of anger. “All I want is to beleft alone to finish my novel. I can’t work anywhere else—I don’t want to, Iwon’t—”“I expected this,” Leigh said, his voice suddenly quiet, and with a strange noteof sympathy. “Man, you can’t get away! You’re caught in the trap, and it’s toolate for you to extricate yourself so long as Abbie Prinn’s brain controls youthrough the Witch Room. And the worst part of it is that she can only manifestherself with your aid—she drains your life forces, Carson, feeds on you like avampire.”“You’re mad,” Carson said dully.“I’m afraid. That iron disk in the Witch Room—I’m afraid of that, and what’sunder it. Abbie Prinn served strange gods, Carson—and I read something on thewall of that alcove that gave me a hint. Have you ever heard of Nyogtha?”Carson shook his head impatiently. Leigh fumbled in a pocket, drew out a scrapof paper. “I copied this from a book in the Kester Library,” he said, “a bookcalled the Necronomicon, written by a man who delved so deeply into forbiddensecrets that men called him mad. Read this.”Carson’s brows drew together as he read the excerpt:Men know him as the Dweller in Darkness, that brother of the Old Ones calledNyogtha, the Thing that should not be. He can be summoned to Earth’s surfacethrough certain secret caverns and fissures, and sorcerers have seen him inSyria and below the black tower of Leng; from the Thang Grotto of Tartary he hascome ravening to bring terror and destruction among the pavilions of the greatKhan. Only by the looped cross, by the Vach-Viraj incantation, and by theTikkoun elixir may he be driven back to the nighted caverns of hidden foulnesswhere he dwelleth.Leigh met Carson’s puzzled gaze calmly. “Do you understand now?”“Incantations and elixirs!” Carson said, handing back the paper. “Fiddlesticks!”“Far from it. That incantation and that elixir have been known to occultists andadepts for thousands of years. I’ve had occasion to use them myself in the paston certain—occasions. And if I’m right about this thing—” He turned to the door,his lips compressed in a bloodless line. “Such manifestations have been defeatedbefore, but the difficulty lies in obtaining the elixir—it’s very hard to get.But I hope … I’ll be back. Can you stay out of the Witch Room until then?”“I’ll promise nothing,” Carson said. He had a dull headache, which had beensteadily growing until it obtruded upon his consciousness, and he felt vaguelynauseated. “Good-bye.”He saw Leigh to the door and waited on the steps, with an odd reluctance toreturn to the house. As he watched the tall occultist hurry down the street, awoman came out of the adjoining house. She caught sight of him, and her hugebreasts heaved. She burst into a shrill, angry tirade.Carson turned, staring at her with astonished eyes. His head throbbed painfully.The woman was approaching, shaking a fat fist threateningly.“Why you scare my Sarah?” she cried, her swarthy face flushed. “Why you scareher wit’ your fool tricks, eh?”Carson moistened his lips.“I’m sorry,” he said slowly. “Very sorry. I didn’t frighten your Sarah. Ihaven’t been home all day. What frightened her?”“T’e brown t’ing—it ran in your house, Sarah say—”The woman paused, and her jaw dropped. Her eyes widened. She made a peculiarsign with her right hand—pointing her index and little fingers at Carson, whileher thumb was crossed over the other fingers. “T’e old witch!”She retreated hastily, muttering in Polish in a frightened voice.Carson turned, went back into the house. He poured some whiskey into a tumbler,considered, and then set it aside untasted. He began to pace the floor,occasionally rubbing his forehead with fingers that felt dry and hot. Vague,confused thoughts raced through his mind. His head was throbbing and feverish.At length he went down to the Witch Room. He remained there, although he did notwork; for his headache was not so oppressive in the dead quiet of theunderground chamber. After a time he slept.How long he slumbered he did not know. He dreamed of Salem, and of a dimlyglimpsed, gelatinous black thing that hurtled with frightful speed through thestreets, a thing like an incredibly huge, jet-black amoeba that pursued andengulfed men and women who shrieked and fled vainly. He dreamed of a skull-facepeering into his own, a withered and shrunken countenance in which only the eyesseemed alive, and they shone with a hellish and evil light.He awoke at last, sat up with a start. He was very cold.It was utterly silent. In the light of the electric bulb the green and purplemosaic seemed to writhe and contract toward him, an illusion which disappearedas his sleep-fogged vision cleared. He glanced at his wrist-watch. It was twoo’clock. He had slept through the afternoon and the better part of the night.He felt oddly weak, and a lassitude held him motionless in his chair. Thestrength seemed to have been drained from him. The piercing cold seemed tostrike through to his brain, but his headache was gone. His mind was veryclear—expectant, as though waiting for something to happen. A movement nearbycaught his eye.A slab of stone in the wall was moving. He heard a gentle grating sound, andslowly a black cavity widened from a narrow rectangle to a square. There wassomething crouching there in the shadow. Stark, blind horror struck throughCarson as the thing moved and crept forward into the light.It looked like a mummy. For an intolerable, age-long second the thought poundedfrightfully at Carson’s brain: It looked like a mummy! It was a skeleton-thin,parchment-brown corpse, and it looked like a skeleton with the hide of somegreat lizard stretched over its bones. It stirred, it crept forward, and itslong nails scratched audibly against the stone. It crawled out into the WitchRoom, its passionless face pitilessly revealed in the white light, and its eyeswere gleaming with charnel life. He could see the serrated ridge of its brown,shrunken back.…Carson sat motionless. Abysmal horror had robbed him of the power to move. Heseemed to be caught in the fetters of dream-paralysis, in which the brain, analoof spectator, is unable or unwilling to transmit the nerve-impulses to themuscles. He told himself frantically that he was dreaming, that he wouldpresently awaken.The withered horror arose. It stood upright, skeleton-thin, and moved to thealcove where the iron disk lay embedded in the floor. Standing with its back toCarson it paused, and a dry and sere whisper rustled out in the dead stillness.At the sound Carson would have screamed, but he could not. Still the dreadfulwhisper went on, in a language Carson knew was not of Earth, and as though inresponse an almost imperceptible quiver shook the iron disk.It quivered and began to rise, very slowly, and as if in triumph the shriveledhorror lifted its pipestem arms. The disk was nearly a foot thick, but presentlyas it continued to rise above the level of the floor an insidious odor began topenetrate the room. It was vaguely reptilian, musky and nauseating. The disklifted inexorably, and a little finger of blackness crept out from beneath itsedge. Abruptly Carson remembered his dream of a gelatinous black creature thathurtled through the Salem streets. He tried vainly to break the fetters ofparalysis that held him motionless. The chamber was darkening, and a blackvertigo was creeping up to engulf him. The room seemed to rock.Still the iron disk lifted; still the withered horror stood with its skeletonarms raised in blasphemous benediction; still the blackness oozed out in slowamoeboid movement.There came a sound breaking through the sere whisper of the mummy, the quickpatter of racing footsteps. Out of the corner of his eye Carson saw a man comeracing into the Witch Room. It was the occultist, Leigh, and his eyes wereblazing in a face of deathly pallor. He flung himself past Carson to the alcovewhere the black horror was surging into view.The withered thing turned with dreadful slowness. Leigh carried some implementin his left hand, Carson saw, a crux ansata of gold and ivory. His right handwas clenched at his side. His voice rolled out, sonorous and commanding. Therewere little beads of perspiration on his white face.“Ya na kadishtu nil gh’ri … stell’bsna kn’aa Nyogtha … k’yarnak phlegethor.…”The fantastic, unearthly syllables thundered out, echoing from the walls of thevault. Leigh advanced slowly, the crux ansata held high. And from beneath theiron disk black horror came surging!The disk was lifted, flung aside, and a great wave of iridescent blackness,neither liquid nor solid, a frightful gelatinous mass, came pouring straight forLeigh. Without pausing in his advance he made a quick gesture with his righthand, and a little glass tube hurtled at the black thing, was engulfed.The formless horror paused. It hesitated, with a dreadful air of indecision, andthen swiftly drew back. A choking stench of burning corruption began to pervadethe air, and Carson saw great pieces of the black thing flake off, shriveling asthough destroyed with corroding acid. It fled back in a liquescent rush, hideousblack flesh dropping as it retreated.A pseudopod of blackness elongated itself from the central mass and like a greattentacle clutched the corpse-like being, dragged it back to the pit and over thebrink. Another tentacle seized the iron disk, pulled it effortlessly across thefloor, and as the horror sank from sight, the disk fell into place with athunderous crash.The room swung in wide circles about Carson, and a frightful nausea clutchedhim. He made a tremendous effort to get to his feet, and then the light fadedswiftly and was gone. Darkness took him.Carson’s novel was never finished. He burned it, but continued to write,although none of his later work was ever published. His publishers shook theirheads and wondered why such a brilliant writer of popular fiction had suddenlybecome infatuated with the weird and ghastly.“It’s powerful stuff,” one man told Carson, as he handed back his novel, BlackGod of Madness. “It’s remarkable in its way, but it’s morbid and horrible.Nobody would read it. Carson, why don’t you write the type of novel you used todo, the kind that made you famous?”It was then that Carson broke his vow never to speak of the Witch Room, and hepoured out the entire story, hoping for understanding and belief. But as hefinished, his heart sank as he saw the other’s face, sympathetic but skeptical.“You dreamed it, didn’t you?” the man asked, and Carson laughed bitterly.“Yes—I dreamed it.”“It must have made a terribly vivid impression on your mind. Some dreams do. Butyou’ll forget about it in time,” he predicted, and Carson nodded.And because he knew that he would only be arousing doubts of his sanity, he didnot mention the thing that was burned indelibly on his brain, the horror he hadseen in the Witch Room after wakening from his faint. Before he and Leigh hadhurried, white-faced and trembling, from the chamber, Carson had cast a quickglance behind him. The shriveled and corroded patches that he had seen sloughoff from that being of insane blasphemy had unaccountably disappeared, althoughthey had left black stains upon the stones. Abbie Prinn, perhaps, had returnedto the hell she had served, and her inhuman god had withdrawn to hidden abyssesbeyond man’s comprehension, routed by powerful forces of elder magic which theoccultist had commanded. But the witch had left a memento behind her, a hideousthing which Carson, in that last backward glance, had seen protruding from theedge of the iron disk, as though raised in ironic salute—a withered, claw-likehand!* Originally published in Weird Tales, May 1937."},{"pageContent":"THE TERROR FROM THE DEPTHS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]FRITZ LEIBER[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Remember thee!Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seatIn this distracted globe.—HAMLETThe following manuscript was found in a curiously embossed copper and Germansilver casket of highly individual modern workmanship which was purchased at anauction of unclaimed property that had been held in police custody for theprescribed number of years in Los Angeles County, California. In the casket withthe manuscript were two slim volumes of verse: Azathoth and Other Horrors byEdward Pickman Derby, Onyx Sphinx Press, Arkham, Massachusetts, and The TunnelerBelow by Georg Reuter Fischer, Ptolemy Press, Hollywood, California. Themanuscript was penned by the second of these poets, except for the two lettersand the telegram interleafed into it. The casket and its contents had passedinto police custody on March 16, 1937, upon the discovery of Fischer’s mutilatedbody by his collapsed brick dwelling in Vultures Roost under circumstances ofconsiderable horror.Today one will search street maps of the Hollywood Hills area in vain for theunincorporated community of Vultures Roost. Shortly after the events narrated inthese pages its name (already long criticized) was changed upon the urging ofprudent real-estate dealers to Paradise Crest, which was in turn absorbed by theCity of Los Angeles—an event not without parallel in that general neighborhood,as when after certain scandals best forgotten, the name of Runnymede was changedto Tarzana after the chief literary creation of its most illustrious andblameless inhabitant.The magneto-optical method of detection referred to herein, “which has alreadydiscovered two new elements,” is neither fraud nor fancy, but a technique highlyregarded in the 1930s (though since discredited), as may be confirmed byconsulting any table of elements from that period or the entries “alabamine” and“virginium” in Webster’s New International Dictionary, second edition,unabridged. (They are not, of course, in today’s tables.) While the “unknownmaster builder Simon Rodia” with whom Fischer’s father conferred is the widelyrevered folk architect (now deceased) who created the matchlessly beautifulWatts Towers.It is only with considerable effort that I can restrain myself from plunginginto the very midst of a description of those unequivocably monstrous hints thathave determined me to take—within the next eighteen hours and no later—adesperate and initially destructive step. There is much to write and only toolittle time in which to write it.I myself need no written argument to bolster my beliefs. It is all more real tome than everyday experience. I have only to close my eyes to see AlbertWilmarth’s horror-whitened long-jawed face and migraine-tormented brow. Theremay be something of clairvoyance in this, for I imagine his expression has notchanged greatly since I last saw him. And I need not make the slightest effortto hear those hideously luring voices, like the susurrus of infernal bees andglorious wasps, which impinge upon an inner ear which I now can never and wouldnever close. Indeed, as I listen to them, I wonder if there is anything to begained from penning this necessarily outre document. It will be found—if it isfound—in a locality where serious people do not attach any importance to strangerevelations and where charlatanry is only too common. Perhaps that is well andperhaps I should make doubly sure by tearing up this sheet, for there is in mymind no doubt of the results that would follow a systematic, scientific effortto investigate those forces which have ambushed and shall soon claim (andperhaps welcome?) me.I shall write, however, if only to satisfy a peculiar personal whim. Ever sinceI can remember I have been drawn to literary creation, but until this very daycertain elusive circumstances and crepuscular forces have prevented mysatisfactorily completing anything more than a number of poems, mostly short,and tiny prose sketches. It would interest me to discover if my new knowledgehas freed me to some extent from those inhibitions. Time enough when I havecompleted this statement to consider the advisability of its destruction (beforeI perpetrate the greater and crucial destruction). Truth to tell, I am notespecially moved by what may or may not happen to my fellow men; there have beenprofound influences (yes, from the depths indeed!) exerted upon my emotionalgrowth and upon the ultimate direction of my loyalties—as will become clear tothe reader in due course.I might begin this narrative with a bald recital of the implications of therecorded findings of Professors Atwood and Pabodie’s portable magneto-opticgeo-scanner, or with Albert Wilmarth’s horrendous revelations of themind-shattering, planet-wide researches made during the past decade by a secretcoterie of faculty members of far-off Miskatonic University in witch-haunted,shadow-beset Arkham and a few lonely colleagues in Boston and Providence, RhodeIsland, or with the shivery clues that with nefarious innocence have found theirway even into the poetry I have written during the past few years. If I didthat, you would be immediately convinced that I was psychotic. The reasons thatled me, step by step, to my present awesome convictions, would appear asprogressive symptoms, and the monstrous horror behind it all would seem ashuddersome paranoid fantasy. Indeed, that will probably be your final judgementin any case, but I will nevertheless tell you what happened just as it happenedto me. Then you will have the same opportunity as I had to discern, if you can,just where reality left off and imagination took up and where imaginationstopped and psychosis supervened.Perhaps within the next seventeen hours something will happen or be revealedthat will in part substantiate what I shall write. I do not think so, for thereis yet untold cunning in the decadent cosmic order which has entrapped me.Perhaps they will not let me finish this narrative; perhaps they will anticipatemy own resolve. I am almost sure they have only held off thus far because theyare sure I will do their work for them. No matter.The sun is just now rising, red and raw, over the treacherous and crumblinghills of Griffith Park (Wilderness were a better designation). The sea fog stillwraps the sprawling suburbs below, its last vestiges are sliding out of high,dry Laurel Canyon, but far off to the south I can begin to discern the blackcongeries of scaffold oil wells near Culver City, like stiff-legged robotsmassing for the attack. And if I were at the bedroom window that opens to thenorthwest, I would see night’s shadows still lingering in the precipitous wildsof Hollywoodland above the faint, twisting, weed-encroached, serpent-hauntedtrails I have limped along daily for most of my natural life, tracing andretracing them ever more compulsively.I can turn off the electric light now; my study is already pierced by shafts oflow, red sunlight. I am at my table, ready to write the day through. Everythingaround me has the appearance of eminent normality and security. There are nosigns remaining of Albert Wilmarth’s frantic midnight departure with themagneto-optic apparatus he brought from the East, yet as if by clairvoyance Ican see his long-jawed horror-sucked face as he clings automatically to thesteering wheel of his little Austin scuttling across the desert like afrightened beetle, the geo-scanner lying on the seat beside him. This day’s sunhas reached him before me as he flees back toward his deeply beloved, impossiblydistant New England. That sun’s smoky red blaze must be in his fear-wide eyes,for I know that no power can turn him back toward the land that slips uncouthinto the titan Pacific. I bear him no resentment—I have no reason to. His nerveswere shattered by the terrors he bravely insisted on helping to investigate forten long years against his steadier comrades’ advice. And at the very end, I amcertain, he saw horrors beyond imagining. Yet he waited to ask me to go with himand only I know how much that must have cost him. He gave me my opportunity toescape; if I had wanted to, I could have made the attempt.But I believe my fate was decided many years ago.My name is Georg Reuter Fischer. I was born in 1912 of Swiss parents in the cityof Louisville, Kentucky, with an inwardly twisted right foot which might havebeen corrected by a brace, except that my father did not believe in interferingwith the workings of Nature, his deity. He was a mason and stonecutter of greatphysical strength, vast energy, remarkable intuitive gifts (a dowser for water,oil, and metals), great natural artistry, unschooled but profoundlyself-educated. A little after the Civil War, when he was a young boy, he hadimmigrated to this country with his father, also a mason, and upon the death ofthe latter, inherited a small but profitable business. Late in life he marriedmy mother, Marie Reuter, daughter of a farmer for whom he had dowsed not only awell but a deposit of granite worth quarrying. I was the child of their age andtheir only child, coddled by my mother and the object of my father’s morethoughtful devotion. I have few memories of our life in Louisville, but thosefew are eminently wholesome ones: visions of an ordered, cheerful household, ofmany cousins and friends, of visitings and laughter, and two great Christmascelebrations; also memories of fascinatedly watching my father at hisstonecutting, bringing a profusion of flowers and leaves to life from death-palegranite.And I will say here, because it is important to my story, that I afterwardlearned that our Fischer and Reuter relatives considered me exceptionallyintelligent for my tender age. My father and mother always believed this, butone must allow for parental bias.In 1917 my father profitably sold his business and brought his tiny family west,to build with his own hands a last home in this land of sunlight, crumblingsandstones, and sea-spawned hills, Southern California. This was in part becausedoctors had advised it as essential for the sake of my mother’s failing health,slow victim of the dread tubercular scourge, but my father had always had astrong yearning for clear skies, year-round heat, and the primeval sea, a deepconviction that his destiny somehow lay west and was involved with Earth’shugest ocean: from which perhaps the moon was torn.My father’s deep-seated longing for this outwardly wholesome and bright,inwardly sinister and eaten-away landscape, where Nature herself presents thenaïve face of youth masking the corruptions of age, has given me much food forthought, though it is in no way a remarkable longing. Many people migrate here,healthy as well as sick, drawn by the sun, the promise of perpetual summer, thebroad if arid fields. The only unusual circumstance worthy of note is that thereis a larger sprinkling than might be expected of persons of professed mysticaland utopian bent. The Brothers of the Rose, the Theosophists, the FoursquareGospelers, the Christian Scientists, Unity, the Brotherhood of the Grail, thespiritualists, the astrologers—all are here and many more besides. Believers inthe need of return to primitive states and primitive wisdoms, practitioners ofpseudo-disciplines dictated by pseudo-sciences—yes, even a few overly sociablehermits—one finds them everywhere; the majority awaken only my pity anddistaste, so lacking in logic and avid for publicity are they. At no time—andlet me emphasize this—have I been at all interested in their doings and in theirignorantly parroted principles, except possibly from the viewpoint ofcomparative psychology.And they were brought here by that excessive love of sunlight whichcharacterizes most faddists of any sort and that urge to find an unsettled,unorganized land in which utopias might take root and burgeon, untroubled byurbane ridicule and tradition-bred opposition—the same urge that led the Mormonsto desert-guarded Salt Lake City, their paradise of Deseret. This seems anadequate explanation, even without bringing in the fact that Los Angeles, a cityof retired farmers and small merchants, a city made hectic by the presence ofthe uncouth motion-picture industry, would naturally attract charlatans of allvarieties. Yes, that explanation is still sufficient to me, and I am ratherpleased, for even now I should hate to think that those hideously alluringvoices a-mutter with secrets from beyond the rim of the cosmos necessarily havesome dim, continent-wide range.(“The carven rim,” they are saying now here in my study. “The proto-shoggoths,the diagramed corridor, the elder Pharos, the dreams of Cutlu …”)Settling my mother and myself at a comfortable Hollywood boarding-house, wherethe activities of the infant film industry provided us with colorfuldistraction, my father tramped the hills in search of a suitable property,bringing to bear his formidable talent for locating underground water anddesirable rock formations. During this period, it occurs to me now, he almostcertainly pioneered those trails which it is my own invariable and ever morecompulsive wont to walk. Within three months he had found and purchased theproperty he sought near a predominantly Alsatian and French settlement (ascatter of bungalows, no more) bearing the perhaps exaggeratedly picturesquename Vultures Roost, redolent of the Old West.Clearing and excavation of the property revealed an upthrust stratum offine-grained solid metamorphic rock, while a little boring provided an excellentwell, to the incredulous astonishment of his initially hostile neighbors. Myfather kept his counsel and began, mostly with his own hands alone, to erect abrick structure of moderate size that by its layout and plans promised adwelling of surpassing beauty. This occasioned more head-shaking and lectures onthe unwisdom of building brick structures in a region where earthquakes were notunknown. They called it Fischer’s Folly, I learned later. Little did theyrealize my father’s skill and the tenacity of his masonry!He bought a small truck and scoured the area as far south as Laguna Beach and asfar north as Malibu, searching for the kilns that would provide him with bricksand tiles of requisite quality. In the end he sheathed the roof partly withcopper, which has turned a beautiful green with the years. During these searcheshe became closely acquainted with the visionary and remarkably progressiveAbbott Kinney, who was building the resort of Venice on the coast ten milesaway, and with the swarthy, bright-eyed, unknown master builder Simon Rodia,self-educated like himself. All three men shared a rich vein of the poetry ofstone, ceramics, and metals.There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man (for myfather was that now, his hair whitely grizzled) to enable him to accomplish somuch hard labor, for within two years my mother and I were able to move into ournew home at Vultures Roost and take up our lives there.I was delighted with my new surroundings and to be rejoined with my father, andonly resentful of the time I must spend at school, to which my father drove meand from which he fetched me each day. I especially enjoyed rambling,occasionally with my father but chiefly by myself, through the wild, dry,rock-crowned hills, spry despite my twisted foot. My mother was fearful for me,especially because of the hairy brown and black tarantulas one sometimesencountered and the snakes, including venomous rattlers, but I was not to berestrained.My father was happy, but also like a man in a dream as he worked unceasingly atthe innumerable tasks, chiefly artistic, involved in finishing our home. It wasa structure of rich beauty, though our neighbors continued to shake their headsand cluck dubiously at its hexagonal shape, partly rounded roof, thick walls oftightly mortared (though unreinforced) brick, and the area of brightly coloredtile and floridly engraved stone. “Fischer’s Folly,” they’d whisper, andchuckle. But swarthy Simon Rodia nodded approvingly when he visited and onceAbbott Kinney came to admire, driven in an expensive car by a black chauffeurwith whom he seemed on terms of easy friendship.My father’s stone engravings were indeed quite fanciful and even a littledisconcerting in their subject matter and location. One was in the basement’sfloor of natural rock, which he had smoothed. From time to time I’d watch himwork on it. Desert plants and serpents seemed to be its subject matter, but asone studied it one became aware that there was much marine stuff too: serratedlooping seaweeds, coiling eels, fishes that trailed tentacles, suckered octopusarms, and two giant squid eyes peering from a coral-crusted castle. And in itsmidst he boldly hewed in a flowery stone script, “The Gate of Dreams.” Mychildish imagination was fired, but I was a little frightened too.It was about this time—1921 or thereabouts—that my sleepwalking began, or at anyrate showed signs of becoming disturbingly persistent. Several times my fatherfound me at varying distances from the house along one of the paths I favored inmy limping rambles and carried me tenderly back, chilled and shivering, forunlike Kentucky in summer, Southern California nights are surprisingly cold. Andmore than once I was found huddled and still asleep in our cellar alongside thegrotesquely floor-set “Gate of Dreams” bas-relief—to which, incidentally, mymother had taken a dislike which she tried to conceal from my father.At that time too my sleeping habits began to show other abnormalities, some ofthem contradictory. Although an active and apparently healthy boy of ten, I wasstill sleeping infancy’s twelve hours or more a night. Yet despite this unusuallength of slumber coupled with the restlessness my sleepwalking would seem tohave indicated, I never dreamed or at any rate remembered dreams upon awakening.And with one notable exception this has been true for my entire life.The exception occurred a little later on, when I was eleven or twelve—in 1923 orthereabouts. I remember those few dreams (there were no more than eight or nineof them) with matchless vividness. How else?—since they were my life’s only onesand since … but I must not anticipate. At the time I was secretive about them,telling neither my father nor my mother, as if for fear my parents might worryor (children are odd!) disapprove, until one final night.In my dream I would find myself making my way through low passages and tunnels,all crudely cut or perhaps gnawed from solid rock. Often I felt I was at a greatdistance under the earth, though why I thought this in my dream I cannot say,except that there was often a sensation of heat and an indescribable feeling ofpressure from above. This last sensation was diminished almost to nothing attimes, though. And sometimes I felt there were vast amounts of water far aboveme, though why I suspected this I cannot say, for the strange tunnels werealways very dry. Yet in my dreams I came to assume that the burrows extendedlimitlessly under the Pacific.There was no obvious source of illumination in the passages. My dreamexplanation of how I then managed to see them was fantastic, though ratheringenious. The floor of the tunnels was colored a strange purplish-green. This Iexplained in my dream as being the reflection of cosmic rays (which were much inthe newspapers then, firing my boyish imagination) that came down through thethick rock above from distantmost outer space. The rounded ceiling of thetunnels, on the other hand, had a weird orange-blue glow. This, I seemed toknow, was caused by the reflection of certain rays unknown to science that cameup through the solid rock from the Earth’s incandescent, constricted core.The eerie mixed light revealed to me the strange engravings or ridgy pictureseverywhere covering the tunnels’ walls. They had a strong suggestion of themarine to them and also of the monstrous, yet they were strangely generalized,as if they were the mathematical diagrams of oceans and their denizens and ofwhole universes of alien life. If the dreams of a monster of supernaturalmentality could be given visual shape, then they would be like those endlessforms I saw on the tunnels’ walls. Or if the dreams of such a monster were halfmaterialized and able to move through such tunnels, they would shape the wallsin such fashion.At first in my dreams I was not conscious of having a body. I seemed to be aviewpoint floating along the tunnels at a definitely rhythmic rate, now faster,now slower.And at first I never saw anything in those tormenting tunnels, though I wascontinually conscious of a fear that I might—a fear mixed with a desire. Thiswas a most disturbing and exhausting feeling, which I could hardly haveconcealed upon awakening save that (with one exception) I never woke until mydream had played itself out, as it were, and my feelings were temporarilyexhausted.And then in my next dream I did begin to see things—creatures—in the tunnels,floating through them in the same general rhythmic fashion as I (or myviewpoint) progressed. They were worms about as long as a man and as thick as aman’s thigh, cylindrical and untapering. From end to end, as many as acentipede’s legs, were pairs of tiny wings, translucent like a fly’s, whichvibrated unceasingly, producing an unforgettably sinister low-pitched hum. Theyhad no eyes—their heads were one circular mouth lined with rows of triangularteeth like a shark’s. Although blind, they seemed able to sense each other atshort distances and their sudden lurching swerves then to avoid colliding witheach other held a particular horror for me. (It was a little like my lurchinglimp.)In my very next dream I became aware of my own dream body. In brief, I wasmyself one of those same winged worms. The horror I felt was extreme, yet oncemore the dream lasted until its intensity was damped out and I could awaken withonly the memory of terror, still able (I thought) to keep my dreams a secret.The next time I had my dream it was to see three of the winged worms writhing ina wider section of tunnel where the sensation of pressure from above wasminimal. I was still observer rather than participant, floating in my worm bodyin a narrower side passageway. How I was able to see while in one of the blindworm bodies, my dream logic did not explain.They were worrying a rather small human victim. Their three snouts convergedupon and covered his face. Their sinister buzzing had a hungry note and therewere sucking sounds.Blond hair, white pajamas, and (projecting from the right leg of those) a footslightly shrunken and twisted sharply inward told me the victim was myself.At that instant I was shaken violently, the scene swam, and through it mymother’s huge terrorized face peered down at me with my father’s anxious visageclose behind.I went into convulsions of terror, flailing my limbs, and I screamed andscreamed. It was hours literally before I could be quieted down, and days beforemy father let me tell them my nightmare.Thereafter he made a strict rule: that no one ever try to shake me awake, nomatter how bad a nightmare I seemed to be having. Later I learned he’d watch meat such times with knitted brow, suppressing the impulse to rouse me and seeingto it that no one else tried to do so.For several nights thereafter I fought sleep, but when my nightmare was neverrepeated and once more I could never remember having dreamed at all when Iwakened, I quieted down and my life, both sleeping and waking, became verytranquil again. In fact, even my sleepwalking became less frequent, although Icontinued to sleep for abnormally long hours, a practice now encouraged by myfather’s injunction that I never be wakened unnaturally.But I have since come to wonder whether this apparent diminishment of myunconscious night-wandering were not because I, or some fraction of me, hadbecome more cunningly deceitful. Habits have in any case a way of slippingslowly from the serious notice of those around.At times, though, I would catch my father looking at me speculatively, as thoughhe would have dearly liked to talk with me of various deep matters, but in theend he would always restrain this impulse (if I had divined it rightly) andcontent himself with encouraging me in my school studies and rambling exercisedespite the latter’s dangers: there were more rattlesnakes about my favoritepaths, perhaps because opossums and raccoons were being exterminated; he made mewear high-laced shoes of stout leather.And once or twice I got the impression that he and Simon Rodia were talkingsecretly about me when the latter visited.On the whole my life was a lonely one and has remained so to this day. We had noneighbors who were friends, no friends who were neighbors. At first this wasbecause of the relative isolation of our residence and the suspicion thatGermanic names uniformly called forth in the years following the World War. Butit continued even after we began to have more neighbors, tolerant newcomers.Perhaps things would have been different if my father had lived longer. (Hishealth was good save for a touch of eyestrain—dancing colors he’d see briefly.)But that was not to be. On that fatal Sunday in 1925 he had joined me on one ofmy customary walks and we had just reached one of my favorite spots when theground gave way under his feet and he vanished from beside me, his startledexclamation dropping in pitch as he fell rapidly. For once his instinct forunderground conditions had deserted him. There was a little scraping rumble as afew rocks and some gravel landslided, then silence. I approached theweed-fringed black hole on my belly and peered down fearfully.From very far below (it sounded) I heard my father call faintly, “Georg! Gethelp!” His voice now had a strained, higher-pitched sound, as if his chest werebeing constricted.“Father! I’m coming down,” I cried, cupping my hands about my mouth, and I hadthrust my twisted foot into the hole searching for support, when his frantic yetclearly enunciated words came up, his voice still higher-pitched and even morestrained, as if he had to make a great effort to get sufficient breath for them:“Do not come down, Georg—you’ll start an avalanche. Get help … a rope!”After a moment’s hesitation I withdrew my leg and set off for home at a hobblinggallop. My horror was heightened (or perhaps a little relieved) by a sense ofthe dramatic—early that year we had listened for weeks on the little crystal setI’d built to the radioed reports of the long protracted, exciting efforts(ultimately unsuccessful) to rescue Floyd Collins from where he’d got himselftrapped in Sand Cave near Cave City, Kentucky. I suppose I anticipated some suchdrama for my father.Most fortunately a young doctor was making a call in our neighborhood and he wasforemost in the party of men I soon guided back to where my father haddisappeared. No sounds at all came from the black hole, although we called andcalled, and I remember that a couple of men had begun to look at me dubiously,as if I’d invented the whole thing, when the courageous young doctor insistedagainst the advice of most on being lowered into the hole—they’d brought astrong rope and an electric flashlight.He was a long time going down, descending about fifty feet in all while callswent back and forth, and almost as long being drawn up. When he emerged allsmeared with sandy dirt—great orange smudges—it was to tell us (he made a pointof laying his hand on my shoulder; I could see my mother hurrying up between twoother women) that my father was inextricably wedged in down there with littlemore than his head exposed and that he was, to an absolute certainty, dead.At that moment there was another grating rumble, and the black hole collapsedupon itself. One of the men standing on its edge was barely jerked to safety. Mymother shrieked, threw herself down on the shaking brown weeds, and was drawnback too.In the subsequent weeks it was decided that my father’s body could not berecovered. Some bags of concrete and sand were dumped into what was left of thehole to seal it. My mother was forbidden to erect a monument at the spot, but insome sort of compensation—I didn’t understand the logic of it—Los Angeles Countypresented her with a cemetery plot elsewhere. (It now holds her own body.) Anunofficial funeral service conducted by a Latin-American priest was eventuallyheld at the spot, and Simon Rodia, defying the injunction, put up a small,nonsectarian ovoid monument of his own matchlessly tough white concrete bearingmy father’s name and beautifully inset with a vaguely aquatic or naval design infragmented blue and green glass. It is still there.After my father’s death I became more withdrawn and brooding than ever, and mymother, a shy consumptive woman full of hysterical fears, hardly encouraged meto become sociable. In fact, almost as long as I can remember and certainly eversince Anton Fischer’s tragic and abrupt demise, nothing has ever bulked largewith me save my own brooding and this brick house set in the hills with itsstrange, queerly set stone carvings and the hills themselves, those sandy,spongy, salt-soaked, sun-baked hills. There has been altogether too much of themin my background: I have limped too long along their crumbling rims, under theircracked and treacherous overhanging sandstones, and through the months-drystreams that thread their separating canyons. I have thought a great deal aboutthe old days when, some Indians are said to have believed, the Strangers camedown from the stars with the great meteor shower and the lizard men perished inthe course of their frantic digging for water and the scaly sea men cametunneling in from their encampments beneath the vast Pacific which constituted awhole world to the west, extensive as that of the stars. I early developed toogreat a love for such savage fancies. Too much of my physical landscape hasbecome the core of my mental landscape. And during the nights of my long, longsleepings, I hobbled through them both, I am somehow sure. While by day I hadhorrible fugitive visions of my father, underground, dead-alive, companied bythe winged worms of my nightmare. Moreover, I developed the notion or fantasythat there was a network of tunnels underlying the paths I limped along andcorresponding to them exactly, but at varying depths and coming closest to thesurface at my “favorite spots.”(“The legend of Yig,” the voices are droning. “The violet wisps, the globularnebulas, Canis Tindalos and their foul essence, the nature of the Doels, thetinted chaos, great Cutlu’s minions …” I have made breakfast but I cannot eat. Ithirstily gulp hot coffee.)I would hardly keep harping on my sleepwalking and on the unnaturally long hoursI spent so deeply asleep that my mother would vow that my mind was elsewhere,were it not associated with a lapse in the intellectual promise I was said tohave shown in earlier years. True, I got along well enough in the semi-ruralgrade school I trudged to and later in the suburban high school to which a bustook me; true too that I early showed interest in many subjects and flashes ofexcellent logic and imaginative reasoning. The trouble was that I did not seemever able to pursue any of those flashes and make a steady and persistenteffort. There would be times when my teachers would worry my mother with reportsof my unpreparedness and my disregard of assignments, though when examinationtime came I almost invariably managed to make a creditable showing. My interestsin more personal directions, too, seemed to peter out very quickly. I wascertainly peculiarly deficient in the power of attention. I remember oftensitting down with a favorite book or text and then finding myself, minutes orhours later, turning over pages far ahead of anything I could remember reading.Sometimes only the memory of my father’s injunctions to study, to study deeply,would keep me prodding on.You may not think this matter worth mentioning. There is nothing strange in alonely sheltered child failing to show great willpower and mental energy. Thereis nothing strange in such a child becoming slothful, weak, and indecisive.Nothing strange—only much to pity and reproach. The powers that be know Ireproached myself often enough, for as my father had encouraged me to, I felt apower and a capability somewhere in myself, but somehow inhibited. But there areonly too many people with power they cannot loose. It is only later events thathave made me see something significant in my lapsings.My mother followed to the letter my father’s directions for my higher education,which I only learned of now. Upon my graduation from high school I was sent to avenerable Eastern institution of learning not as well known as those of the IvyLeague, but of equally high standing—Miskatonic University, which lies on theserpentine river of that name within the antique town of Arkham with its gambrelroofs and elm-shaded avenues quiet as the footsteps of a witch’s familiar. Myfather had first heard of the school from an Eastern employer of his talents, aHarley Warren for whom he had done some unusual dowsing in a cemetery within aswamp of cypresses, and that man’s high praise of Miskatonic had imprinteditself indelibly upon his memory. My previous school record did not permit ofthis (I lacked certain prerequisites) but I just barely managed—much to thesurprise of all my previous teachers—to pass a stiff entrance examination whichrequired, like that of Dartmouth, some knowledge of Greek as well as Latin. OnlyI knew how much furious, imagination-invoking guessing that took. I could notbear to fall utterly short of my father’s hopes for me.Unfortunately, my efforts were in vain. Before the first term ended I was backin Southern California, physically and mentally depleted by a series of attacksof nervousness, homesickness, actual ailment (anemia), an increase in the hoursI devoted to sleep, and an almost incredible recurrence of my sleepwalking,which more than once carried me deep into the wild hills west of Arkham. I triedfor what seemed to me a long time to stick it out, but was advised by thecollege doctors to give it up after some particularly bad attacks. I believethat they thought I was not cut out to be even a moderately strong individualand that they pitied me more than they sympathized with me. It is not a goodthing to see a youth racked by sentiments and longings proper to a fearfulchild.And they appeared to be right in this (although I know now that they werewrong), for my malady turned out (apparently) to be simple homesickness andnothing more. It was with a feeling of immense relief that I returned to mymother and our brick home in the hills, and with each room I reentered I gainedmore assurance—even, or perhaps especially, the cellar with its well-swept floorof solid rock, my father’s tools and chemicals (acids, etc.), and the marinelydecorated, floor-set rock inscription “The Gate of Dreams.” It was as though allthe time I had been at Miskatonic there had been an invisible leash dragging meback, and only now had its pressure slackened completely.(Those voices are continent-wide, of course: “The essential salts, the fane ofDagon, the gray twisted brittle monstrosity, the flute-tormented pandemonium,the coral-encrusted towers of Rulay …”)And the hills helped me as much as my home. For a month I roamed them daily andwalked the old familiar paths between the parched and browning undergrowth, mymind full of old tales and scraps of childhood brooding. I think it was onlythen, only with my returning, that I first came fully to realize how much (and alittle of what) those hills meant to me. From Mount Waterman and steep MountWilson with its great observatory and hundred-inch reflector down throughcavernous Tujunga Canyon with its many sinuous offshoots to the flat lands andthen across the squat Verdugo Hills and the closer ones with GriffithObservatory and its lesser ’scopes, to sinister, almost inaccessible Potrero andgreat twisting Topanga Canyons that open with the abruptness of catastrophe uponthe monstrous, primeval Pacific—all of them (the hills) with few exceptionssandy, cracked, and treacherous, the earth like rock and the rock like driedearth, rotten, crumbling, and porous: all this had such a hold on me (thelimper, the fearful listener) as to be obsessive. And indeed there were more andmore symptoms of obsession now: I favored certain paths over others forill-defined reasons and there were places I could not pass without stopping fora little. My fantasy or notion became stronger than ever that there were tunnelsunder the paths, traveled by beings which attracted the venomous snakes of theouter world because they were akin to them. Could some eerie reality haveunderlaid my childhood nightmare?—I shied away from that thought.All this, as I say, I realized during the month after my defeated return fromthe East. And at the end of that month I resolved to conquer my obsession and myrevolting homesickness and all the subtle weaknesses and inner hindrances thatkept me from being the man my father had dreamed of. I had found that a completebreak such as my father had planned for me (Miskatonic) would not work; so Idetermined to work out my troubles without running away: I would take courses atnearby UCLA (the University of California at Los Angeles). I would study andexercise, build up both body and mind. I remember that my determination wasintense. There is something very ironic about that, for my plan, logical as itseemed, was the one sure course to further psychological entrapment.For quite some time, however, I seemed to be getting on successfully. Withsystematic exercise and better-controlled diet and rest (still my twelve hours anight), I became healthier than I ever had been before. All the troubles thathad beset me in the East vanished completely away. No longer did I wakeshuddering from my dreamless sleepwalking; in fact, as far as I could determineat the time, that habit had gone for good. And at college, from which I returnedhome nightly, I made steady progress. It was then that I first began to writethose imaginative and pessimistic poems tinged with metaphysical speculationthat have won me some little attention from a small circle of readers. Oddly,they were sparked by the one significant item I had brought back with me fromshadow-beset Arkham, a little book of verse I’d bought at a dusty secondhandstore there, Azathoth and Other Horrors by Edward Pickman Derby, a local poet.Now I know that my spurt of new effort during my college years was largelydeceptive. Because I had decided upon a new course of life that brought me intoa few new situations (though keeping me at home), I thought I was progressingvastly. I managed to keep on believing that for all my college years. That Icould never study any subject profoundly, that I could never create anythingthat took a protracted effort, I explained by telling myself that what I wasdoing was “preparation” and “intellectual orientation” for some great futureeffort. For several years I managed to conceal from myself the fact that I couldonly call a tithe of my energy my own, while the residuum was being shunted downonly the powers that be know what inner channels.I thought I knew what books I was studying, but the voices now are telling me,“The runes of Nug-Soth, the clavicle of Nyarlathotep, the litanies of Lomar, thesecular meditations of Pierre-Louis Montagny, the Necronomicon, the chants ofCromYa, the overviews of Yiang-Li …”(It is midday or later outside, but the house is cool. I have managed to eat alittle and made more coffee. I have been down to the basement, checking myfather’s tools and things, his sledge, carboys of acid, et cetera, and lookingat “The Gate of Dreams” and treading softly. The voices are strongest there.)Suffice it that during my six college and “poetic” years (I couldn’t carry afull load of courses) I lived not as a man, but as a fraction of a man. I hadgradually given up all grand ambitions and become content to lead a life inminiature. I spent my time going to easy classes, writing fragments of prose andan occasional poem, caring for my mother (who except for her worries about mewas undemanding) and for my father’s house (so well built it needed hardly anycare), rambling almost absentmindedly in the hills, and sleeping prodigiously. Ihad no friends. In fact, we had no friends. Abbott Kinney had died and LosAngeles had stolen his Venice. Simon Rodia gave up his visits, for he was nowtotally preoccupied with his great single-handed building project. Once on mymother’s urging I went to Watts, a settlement of flower-decked humble bungalowsdwarfed by his fabulous backyard towers that were rising like a blue-greenPersian dream. He had trouble recalling who I was and then he watched mestrangely as he worked. The money my father had left (in silver dollars) wasample for my mother and myself. In short, I had become, not unpleasantly,resigned.This was all the easier for me because of my growing absorption in the doctrinesof such men as Oswald Spengler who believe that culture and civilization go bycycles and that our own Faustian Western world, with all its grandiose dream ofscientific progress, is headed toward a barbarism that will engulf it as surelyas the Goths, Vandals, Scythians, and Huns engulfed mighty Rome and herlonger-lived sister, dwindling Byzantium. As I looked from my hilltops down onbustling Los Angeles always a-building, I placidly thought of the future dayswhen little bands of blustering, ill-kempt barbarians will walk the streets ofhumped and pitted asphalt and look on each of its ruined, many-purposedbuildings as just another “hut”; when high-set Griffith Park Planetarium,romantically rock-built, high-walled, and firmly bastioned, will be thestronghold of some petty dictator; when industry and science will be gone andall their machines and instruments rusted and broken and their useforgotten … and all our works forgotten as completely as those of the sunkencivilization of Mu in the Pacific, of the fragments of whose cities only remainNan Matol and Rapa Nui, or Easter Island.But whence did these thoughts really come? Not entirely or even principally fromSpengler, I’ll be bound. No, they had a deeper source, I greatly fear.Yet thus I thought, thus I believed, and thus I was wooed away from the pursuitsand tempting goals of our commercial world. I saw everything in terms oftransciency, decadence, and decline—as if the times were as rotten and crumblingas the hills which obsessed me.It was that I was convinced, not that I was morbid. No, my health was betterthan ever and I was neither bored nor dissatisfied. Oh, I occasionally beratedmyself for failure to manifest the promise my father had seen in me, but on thewhole I was strangely content. I had a weird sense of power andself-satisfaction, as if I were a man in the midst of some engrossing pursuit.You know the pleasant relief and bone-deep satisfaction that comes after a dayof successful hard work? Well, that was the way I felt almost all the time, dayin and day out. And I took my happiness as a gift of the gods. It did not occurto me to ask, “Which gods? Are they from heaven … or from the underworld?”Even my mother was happier, her disease arrested, her son devoted to her andleading a busy life (on a very small scale) and doing nothing to worry herbeyond his occasional rambles in the snake-infested hills.Fortune smiled on us. Our brick dwelling rode out the severe Long Beachearthquake of March 10, 1933, without sustaining the least damage. Those whostill called it Fischer’s Folly were nonplussed.Last year (1936) I duly received from UCLA my bachelor’s diploma in Englishliterature, with a minor in history, my mother proudly attending the ceremony.And a month or so later she seemed as childishly delighted as I at the arrivalof the first bound copies of my little book of verse, The Tunneler Below,printed at my own expense, and in my hubristic mood of auctorial conceit I notonly sent out several copies for review but also donated two to the UCLA libraryand two more to that at Miskatonic. In my covering letter to the erudite Dr.Henry Armitage, librarian at the latter institution, I mentioned not only mybrief attendance there, but also my inspiration by an Arkham poet. I also toldhim a little about the circumstances of my composition of the poems.I joked deprecatingly to my mother about this last expansive gesture of mine,but she knew how deeply I had been hurt by my failure at Miskatonic and howstrongly I desired to repair my reputation there, so when only a few weeks latera letter came addressed to me and bearing the Arkham postmark, she hurried outinto the hills quite against her usual wont, to bring it to me, I having justgone out on one of my rambles.From where I was, I barely heard, yet also recognized her mortal screams. Irushed back at my most desperate limping speed. At the very spot where my fatherhad perished, I found her writhing on the hard, dry ground and screamingstill—and near to her and whipping about, the large young rattlesnake that hadbitten her on the calf, which was already swelling.I killed the horrid thing with the stick I carry, then slashed the bite with mysharp pocketknife and sucked it out and injected antivenin from the kit I havealways with me on my walks.All to no avail. She died two days later in the hospital. Once more there wasnot only shock and depression, but also the dismal business of a funeral to getthrough (at least we already owned a grave lot), this time a more conventionalceremony, but this time I was wholly alone.It was a week before I could bring myself to look at the letter she’d beenbringing me. After all, it had been the cause of her death. I almost tore it upunread. But after I had got into it, I became more and more interested and thenincredulously amazed … and frightened. Here it is, in its entirety:118 Saltonstall St.,Arkham, Mass.,Aug. 12, 1936.Georg Reuter Fischer, Esq.,Vultures Roost,Hollywood, Calif.My dear Sir:—Dr. Henry Armitage took the liberty of letting me peruse your The Tunneler Belowbefore it was placed on general circulation in the university library. May onewho serves only in the outer court of the muses’ temple, and particularlyoutside Polyhymnia’s and Erato’s shrines, be permitted to express his deepappreciation of your creative achievement? And to tender respectfully the likeadmirations of Professor Wingate Peaslee of our psychology department and of Dr.Francis Morgan of medicine and comparative anatomy, who share my specialinterests, and of Dr. Armitage himself? “The Green Deeps” is in particular aremarkably well-sustained and deeply moving lyric poem.I am an assistant professor of literature at Miskatonic and an enthusiasticamateur student of New England and other folklore. If memory serves, you were inmy freshman English section six years ago. I was sorry then that the state ofyour health forced you to curtail your studies, and I am happy now to havebefore me conclusive evidence that you have completely surmounted all suchdifficulties. Congratulations!And now will you allow me to pass on to another and very different matter, whichis nonetheless peripherally related to your poetic work? Miskatonic is currentlyengaged in a broad interdepartmental research in the general area of folklore,language, and dreams, an investigation of the vocabulary of the collectiveunconscious, particularly as it expresses itself in poetry. The three scholars Ihave alluded to are among those active in this work, along with persons in BrownUniversity, Providence, Rhode Island, who are carrying on the pioneering work ofthe late Professor George Gammell Angell, and from time to time I am honored torender them assistance. They have empowered me to ask you for your own help inthis matter, which could be of signal importance. It is a matter of answering afew questions only, relating to the accidents of your writing and in no wayimpinging on its essence, and should not cut seriously into your time. Naturallyany information you choose to supply will be treated as strictly confidential.I call your attention to the following two lines in “The Green Deeps”:Intelligence doth grow itself withinThe coral-palled, squat towers of Rulay.Did you in composing this poem ever consider a more eccentric spelling of thelast (and presumably invented?) word? “R’lyeh,” say. And going back three lines,did you consider spelling “Nath” (invented?) with an initial “p”—i.e., “Pnath”?Also in the same poem:The rampant dragon dreams in far CathayWhile snake-limbed Cutlu sleeps in deep Rulay.The name “Cutlu” (once more, invented?) is of considerable interest to us. Didyou have phonetic difficulty in choosing the letters to represent the sound youhad in mind? Did you perhaps simplify in the interests of poetic clarity? At anytime did “Cthulhu” ever occur to you?(As you can see, we are discovering that the language of the collectiveunconscious is almost unpleasantly guttural and sibilant! All hawking andspitting, like German.)Also, there is this quatrain in your impressive lyric, “Sea Tombs”:Their spires underlie our deepest graves;Lit are they by a light that man has seen.Only the wingless worm can go betweenOur daylight and their vault beneath the waves.Were there some proofreading errors here?—or the equivalent. Specifically, inthe second line should “that” be “no”? (And was the light you had in mind whatyou might call orange-blue or purple-green, or both?) And, in the next line, howdoes “winged” rather than “wingless” strike you?Finally, in regard to “Sea Tombs” and also the title poem of your book,Professor Peaslee has a question which he calls a “long shot” about thesubterranean and submarine tunnels which you evoke. Did you ever have fantasiesof such tunnels really existing in the area where you composed the poem?—theHollywood Hills and Santa Monica Mountains, presumably, the Pacific Ocean beingnearby. Did you perhaps try actually to trace the paths overlying these fanciedtunnels? And did you happen to notice (excuse the strangeness of this question)an unusual number of venomous serpents along such routes?—rattlers, I wouldpresume (in our area it would be copperheads, and in the South water moccasinsand coral snakes). If so, do take care!If such tunnels should by some strange coincidence actually exist, it would bescientifically possible to confirm the fact without any digging or drilling (orby discovering an existent opening), it may interest you to know. Evenvacuity—i.e., nothing—leaves its traces, it appears! Two Miskatonic scienceprofessors, who are part of the interdepartmental program I mentioned, havedevised a highly portable apparatus for the purpose, which they call amagneto-optic geo-scanner. (That last hybrid word must sound a most clumsy andbarbarous coinage to a poet, I’m sure, but you know scientists!) It is strange,is it not, to think of an investigation of dreams having geologicalrepercussions? The clever though infelicitously named instrument is a simplifiedadaptation of one which has already discovered two new elements.I shall be making a trip west early next year, to confer with a man in San Diegowho happens to be the son of the scholarly recluse whose researches led to ourinterdepartmental program—Henry Wentworth Akeley. (The local poet—alas,deceased—to whom you pay such generous tribute, was another such pioneer, ithappens oddly.) I shall be driving my own British sports car, a diminutiveAustin. I am something of an automobile maniac, I must confess, even a speeddemon!—however inappropriate that may be for an assistant English professor. Iwould be very pleased to make your further acquaintance at that time, ifentirely agreeable to you. I might even bring along a geo-scanner and we couldcheck out those hypothetical tunnels!But I perhaps anticipate and presume too far. Pardon me. I will be very gratefulfor any attention you are able to give this letter and its necessarilyimpertinent questions.Once more, congratulations on The Tunneler!Yrs. very truly,Albert N. Wilmarth.It is quite impossible to describe all at once my state of mind when I finishedreading this letter. I can only do so by stages. To begin with, I was flatteredand gratified, even acutely embarrassed, by his apparently sincere praise of myverses—as what young poet wouldn’t be? And that a psychologist and an oldlibrarian (even an anatomist!) should admire them too—it was almost too much.As soon as the man mentioned freshman English I realized that I had a vividmemory of him. Although I’d forgotten his name in the course of years, it cameback to me like a shot when I glanced ahead at the end of the letter and saw it.He had been only an instructor then, a tall young man, cadaverously thin, alwaysmoving about with nervous rapidity, his shoulders hunched. He’d had a long jawand a pale complexion, with dark-circled eyes which gave him a haunted look, asif he were constantly under some great strain to which he never alluded. He hadthe habit of jerking out a little notebook and making jottings without ceasingfor a moment to discourse fluently, even brilliantly. He’d seemed incrediblywell read and had had a lot to do with stimulating and deepening my interest inpoetry. I even remembered his car—the other students used to joke about it withan undercurrent of envy. It had been a Model T Ford then, which he’d alwaysdriven at a brisk clip around the fringes of the Miskatonic campus, taking turnsvery sharply.The program of interdepartmental research he described sounded very impressive,even exciting, but eminently plausible—I was just discovering Jung then and alsosemantics. And to be invited so graciously to take part in it—once again I wasflattered. If I hadn’t been alone while I read it, I might have blushed.One notion I got then did stop me briefly and for a moment almost turned meangrily against the whole thing—the sudden suspicion that the purpose of theprogram might not be the avowed one, that (the presence in it of a psychologistand a medical doctor influenced me in this) it was some sort of investigation ofthe delusions of crankish, imaginative people—not so much the incidentalinsights as the psychopathology of poets.But he was so very gracious and reasonable—no, I was being paranoid, I toldmyself. Besides, as soon as I got a ways into his detailed questions it was analtogether different reaction that filled me—one of utter amazement … and fear.For starters, he was so incredibly accurate in his guesses (for what else couldthey possibly be? I asked myself uneasily) about those invented names, that hehad me gasping. I had first thought of spelling them “R’lyeh” and“Pnath”—exactly those letters, though of course memory can be tricky about suchthings.And then that Cthulhu—seeing it spelled that way actually made me shiver, it soprecisely conveyed the deep-pitched, harsh, inhuman cry or chant I’d imaginedcoming up from profound black abysses, and only finally rendered as “Cutlu”rather dubiously, but fearing anything more complex would seem affectation.(And, really, you can’t fit the inner rhythms of a sound like “Cthulhu” intoEnglish poetry.)And then to find that he’d spotted those two proofreader’s errors, for they’dbeen just that. The first I’d missed. The second (“wingless” for “winged”) I’dcaught, but then rather spinelessly let stand, feeling all of a sudden that I’dperpetuated something overly fantastic when I’d put a figure from my life’s onenightmare (a worm with wings) into a poem.And topping even that, how in the name of all that’s wonderful could he havedescribed unearthly colors I’d only dreamed of and never put into my poems atall? Using exactly the same color-words I’d used! I began to think thatMiskatonic’s interdepartmental research project must have made some epochaldiscoveries about dreams and dreaming and the human imagination in general,enough to turn their scholars into wizards and dumbfound Adler, Freud, and evenJung.At that point in my reading of the letter I thought he’d hit me with everythinghe possibly could, but the next section managed to mine a still deeper source ofhorror and one most disturbingly close to everyday reality. That he should know,somehow deduce, all about my paths in the hills and my odd daydreams about themand about tunnels I’d fancied underlying them—that was truly staggering. Andthat he should ask and even warn me about venomous snakes, so that the veryletter my mother was carrying unopened when she got her death sting contained avital reference to it—really, for a moment and more then, I did wonder if I weregoing insane.And finally when despite all his jaunty “fancied’s” and “long shot’s” and“hypothetical’s” and English-professor witticisms, he began to talk as if heassumed my imaginary tunnels were real and to refer lightly to a scientificinstrument that would prove it … well, by the time I’d finished his letter, Ifully expected him to turn up the next minute—turn in sharply at our drive witha flourish of wheels and brakes in his Model T (no, Austin) and draw up in acloud of dust at our door, the geo-scanner sitting on the front seat beside himlike a fat black telescope directed downward!And yet he’d been so damnably breezy about it all! I simply didn’t know what tothink.(I’ve been down in the basement again, checking things out. This writing stirsme up and makes me frightfully restless. I went out front, and there was arattlesnake crossing the path in the hot slanting sunlight from the west. Moreevidence, if any were needed, that what I fear is true. Or do I hope for it? Atall events, I killed the brute. The voices vibrate with, “The half-born worlds,the alien orbs, the stirrings in blackness, the hooded forms, the nighteddepths, the shimmering vortices, the purple haze …”)When I’d calmed down somewhat next day, I wrote Wilmarth a long letter,confirming all his hints, confessing my utter astonishment at them, and begginghim to explain how he’d made them. I volunteered to assist the interdepartmentalproject in any way I could and invited him to be my guest when he came west. Igave him a brief history of my life and my sleep anomalies, mentioning mymother’s death. I had a strange feeling of unreality as I posted the letter andwaited with mixed feelings of impatience and lingering (and also regathering)incredulity for his reply.When it came, quite a fat one, it rekindled all my first excitement, thoughwithout satisfying all my curiosity by any means. Wilmarth was still inclined towrite off his and his colleagues’ deductions about my word choices, dreams, andfantasies as lucky guesses, though he told me enough about the project to keepmy curiosity in a fever—especially about its discoveries of obscure linkagesbetween the life of the imagination and archaeological discoveries in far-offplaces. He seemed particularly interested in the fact that I generally neverdreamed and that I slept for very long hours. He overflowed with thanks for mycooperation and my invitation, promising to include me on his itinerary when hedrove west. And he had a lot more questions for me.The next months were strange ones. I lived my normal life, if it can be calledthat, keeping up my reading and studies and library visits, even writing alittle new poetry from time to time. I continued my hill-ramblings, though witha new wariness. Sometimes during them I’d stop and stare at the dry earthbeneath my feet, as if expecting to trace the outlines of a trapdoor in it. Andsometimes I’d be consumed by sudden, wildly passionate feelings of grief andguilt at the thought of my father locked down there and at my mother’s horribledeath too; I’d feel I must somehow go to them at all costs.And yet at the same time I was living only for Wilmarth’s letters and the moodsof wonder, fantastic speculation, and panic—yet almost delicious terror—theyevoked in me. He’d write about all sorts of things besides the project—my poetryand new readings and my ideas (he’d play the professorial mentor here from timeto time), world events, the weather, astronomy, submarines, his pet cats,faculty politics at Miskatonic, town meetings at Arkham, his lectures, and thelocal trips he’d make. He made it all extremely interesting. Clearly he was aninveterate letter-writer and under his influence I became one too.But most of all, of course, I was fascinated by what he’d write from time totime about the project. He told me some very interesting things about theMiskatonic Antarctic expedition of 1930–31, with its five great Dornierairplanes, and last year’s somewhat abortive Australian one in which thepsychologist Peaslee and his father, a onetime economist, had been involved. Iremembered having read about them both in the newspapers, though the reportsthere had been curiously fragmentary and unsatisfying, almost as if the presswere prejudiced against Miskatonic.I got the strong impression that Wilmarth would have liked very much to haveaccompanied both expeditions and was very much put out at not having been able(or allowed) to, though most of the time bravely concealing his disappointment.More than once he referred to his “unfortunate nervousness,” sensitivity tocold, fierce migraine attacks, and “bouts of ill health” which would put him tobed for a few days. And sometimes he’d speak with wistful admiration of theprodigious energy and stalwart constitutions of several of his colleagues, suchas Professors Atwood and Pabodie, the geo-scanner’s inventors, Dr. Morgan, whowas a big-game hunter, and even the octogenarian Armitage.There were occasional delays in his replies, which always filled me with anxietyand restlessness, sometimes because of these attacks of his and sometimesbecause he’d been away longer than he’d expected on some visit. One of thelatter was to Providence to confer with colleagues and help investigate thedeath under mysterious circumstances involving a lightning bolt of Robert Blake,a poet like myself, short-story writer, and painter whose work had provided muchmaterial for the project.It was just after his visit to Providence that with a curious sort ofguardedness and reluctance he mentioned visiting another colleague of sortsthere (who was in poor health), a Howard Phillips Lovecraft, who hadfictionalized (but quite sensationally, Wilmarth warned me) some Arkham scandalsand some of Miskatonic’s researches and project activities. These stories hadbeen published (when at all) in cheap pulp magazines, especially in a luridjournal called Weird Tales (you’ll want to tear the cover off, if ever youshould dare to buy a copy, he assured me). I recalled having seen the magazineon downtown newsstands in Hollywood and Westwood. I hadn’t found the coversoffensive. Most of their nude female figures, by some sentimental woman artist,were decorously sleek pastels and their activities only playfully perverse.Others, by one Senf, were a rather florid folk art quite reminiscent of myfather’s floral chiselings.But after that, of course, I haunted secondhand bookstores, hunting down copiesof Weird Tales (mostly) with Lovecraft stories in them, until I’d found a fewand read them—one, “The Call of Cthulhu,” no less. It cost me the strangestshudders, let me tell you, to see that name again, spelled out in cheapestprint, under such very outlandish circumstances. Truly, my sense of reality wasset all askew and if the tale that Lovecraft told with a strange dignity andpower was anything like the truth, then Cthulhu was real, an other-dimensionalextraterrestrial monster dreaming in an insane, Pacific-sunken metropolis whichsent out mental messages (and—who knows?—tunnels) to the world at large. Inanother tale, “The Whisperer in Darkness,” Albert N. Wilmarth was a leadingcharacter, and that Akeley too he’d mentioned.It was all fearfully unsettling and confounding. If I hadn’t attended Miskatonicmyself and lived in Arkham, I’d have thought surely they were a writer’sprojections.As you can imagine, I continued to haunt the dusty bookstores and I bombardedWilmarth with frantic questions. His replies were of a most pacifying andtemporizing sort. Yes, he’d been afraid of my getting too excited, but hadn’tbeen able to resist telling me about the stories. Lovecraft often laid on thingsvery thickly indeed. I’d understand everything much better when we could reallytalk together and he could explain in person. Really, Lovecraft had an extremelypowerful imagination and sometimes it got out of hand. No, Miskatonic had nevertried to suppress the stories or take legal action, for fear of even lessdesirable publicity—and because the project members thought the stories might bea good preparation for the world if some of their more frightening hypotheseswere verified. Really, Lovecraft was a very charming and well-intentionedperson, but sometimes he went too far. And so on and so on.Really, I don’t think I could have contained myself except that, it now being1937, Wilmarth sent me word that he was at last driving west. The Austin hadbeen given a thorough overhaul and was “packed to the gills” with thegeo-scanner, endless books and papers, and other instruments and materials,including a drug Morgan had just refined, “which induces dreaming and may,conceivably, he says, facilitate clairvoyance and clairaudience. It might makeeven you dream—should you consent to ingest an experimental dose.”While he was gone from 118 Saltonstall his rooms would be occupied and his cats,including his beloved Blackfellow, cared for by a close friend named Danforth,who’d spent the last five years in a mental hospital recovering from his ghastlyAntarctic experience at the Mountains of Madness.Wilmarth hated to leave at this time, he wrote, in particular he was worriedabout Lovecraft’s failing health, but nevertheless he was on his way!The next weeks (which dragged out to two months) were a time of particulartension, anxiety, and anticipatory excitement for me. Wilmarth had many morepeople and places to visit and investigations to make (including readings withthe geo-scanner) than I’d ever imagined. Now he sent mostly postcards, some ofthem scenic, but they came thick and fast (except for a couple of worrisomehiatuses) and with his minuscule handwriting he got so much on them (even thescenic ones) that at times I almost felt I was with him on his trip, worryingabout the innards of his Austin, which he called the Tin Hind after Sir FrancisDrake’s golden one. I on my part had only a few addresses he’d listed for mewhere I could write him in advance—Baltimore; Winchester, Virginia; BowlingGreen, Kentucky; Memphis; Carlsbad, New Mexico; Tucson; and San Diego.First he had to stop in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, with its quaintly backwardfarm communities, to investigate some possibly pre-Colonial ruins and hunt for arumored cave, using the geo-scanner. Next, after Baltimore, there were extensivelimestone caverns to check out in both Virginias. He crossed the AppalachiansWinchester to Clarsksburg, a stretch with enough sharp turns to satisfy evenhim. Approaching Louisville, the Tin Hind was almost swallowed up in the GreatOhio Flood (which preoccupied the radio news for days; I hung over mysuperheterodyne set) and he was unable to visit a new correspondent ofLovecraft’s there. Then there was more work for the geo-scanner near MammothCave. In fact, caves seemed to dominate his journey, for after a side trip toNew Orleans to confer with some occult scholar of French extraction, there werethe Carlsbad Caverns and nearby but less well-known subterranean vacuities. Iwondered more and more about my tunnels.The Tin Hind held up very well, except she blew out a piston head crossing Texas(“I held her at high speed a little too long”) and he lost three days gettingher mended.Meanwhile, I was finding and reading new Lovecraft stories. One, which turned upin a secondhand but quite recent science-fiction pulp, fictionalized theAustralian expedition most impressively—especially the dreams old Peaslee hadthat led to it. In them, he’d exchanged personalities with a cone-shaped monsterand was forever wandering through long stone passageways haunted by invisiblewhistlers. It reminded me so much of my nightmares in which I’d done the samething with a winged worm that buzzed, that I airmailed a rather desperate letterto Tucson, telling Wilmarth all about it. I got a reply from San Diego, full ofreassurances and more temporizings, and referring to old Akeley’s son and somesea caverns they were looking into, and (at last!) setting a date (it would besoon!) for his arrival.The day before that last, I made a rare find in my favorite Hollywoodhunting-ground. It was a little, strikingly illustrated book by Lovecraft calledThe Shadow Over Innsmouth and issued by Visionary Press, whoever they were. Iwas up half the night reading it. The narrator found some sinister, scaly humanbeings living in a deep submarine city off New England, realized he was himselfturning into one of them, and at the end had decided (for better or worse) todive down and join them. It made me think of crazy fantasies I’d had of somehowgoing down into the earth beneath the Hollywood Hills and rescuing or joining mydead father.Meanwhile mail addressed to Wilmarth care of me had begun to arrive. He’d askedmy permission to include my address on the itinerary he’d sent othercorrespondents. There were letters and cards from (by their postmarks) Arkhamand places along his route, some from abroad (mostly England and Europe, but onefrom Argentina), and a small package from New Orleans. The return address onmost of them was his own—118 Saltonstall, so he’d eventually get them even if hemissed them along his route. (He’d asked me to do the same with my own notes.)The effect was odd, as though Wilmarth were the author of everything—it almostre-aroused my first suspicions of him and the project. (One letter, though amongthe last to come, a thick one bearing extravagantly a six-cent airmail stamp anda ten-cent special delivery, had been addressed to George Goodenough Akeley, 176Pleasant St., San Diego, Cal., and then forwarded care of my own address in theupper-left-hand corner.)Late the next afternoon (Sunday, April 14—the eve of my twenty-fifth birthday,as it happened) Wilmarth arrived very much as I’d imagined it occurring when I’dfinished reading his first letter, except the Tin Hind was even smaller than I’dpictured—and enameled a bright blue, though now most dusty. There was an oddblack case on the seat beside him, though there were a lot of other things on ittoo—maps, mostly.He greeted me very warmly and began to talk a blue streak almost at once, withmany a jest and frequent little laughs.The thing that really shocked me was that although I knew he was only in histhirties, his hair was white and the haunted (or hunted) look I’d remembered wasmonstrously intensified. And he was extremely nervous—at first he couldn’t staystill a moment. It wasn’t long before I became certain of something I’d neveronce suspected before—that his breeziness and jauntiness, his jokes and laughs,were a mask for fear, no, for sheer terror, that otherwise might have masteredhim entirely.His actual first words were, “Mr. Fischer, I presume? So glad to meet you in theflesh!—and share your most salubrious sunlight. I look as if I need it, do Inot?—a horrid sight! This landscape hath a distinctly cavish, tunnellyaspect—I’m getting to be an old hand at making such geological judgements.Danforth writes that Blackfellow has quite recovered from his indisposition. ButLovecraft is in the hospital—I do not like it. Did you observe last night’sbrilliant conjunction?—I like your clear, clear skies. No, I will carry thegeo-scanner (yes, it is that); it’s somewhat crankish. But you might take thesmall valise. Really, so very glad!”He did not comment on or even seem to notice my twisted right foot (something Ihadn’t mentioned in my letters, though he may have recalled it from six yearsback) or imply its or my limp’s existence in any way, as by insisting oncarrying the valise also. That warmed me toward him.And before going into the house with me, he paused to praise its unusualarchitecture (another thing I hadn’t told him about) and seemed genuinelyimpressed when I admitted that my father had built it by himself. (I’d fearedhe’d find it overly eccentric and also question whether someone could work withhis hands and be a gentleman.) He also commented favorably on my father’s stonecarvings wherever they turned up and insisted on pausing to study them, whippingout his notebook to make some quick jottings. Nothing would do, but I must takehim on a full tour of the house before he’d consent to rest or takerefreshments. I left his valise in the bedroom I’d assigned him (my parents’, ofcourse), but he kept lugging the black geo-scanner around with him. It was anodd case, taller than it was wide or long, and it had three adjustable stubbylegs, so that it could be set up vertically anywhere.Emboldened by his approval of my father’s carvings, I told him about Simon Rodiaand the strangely beautiful towers he was building in Watts, whereupon thenotebook came out again and there were more jottings. He seemed particularlyimpressed by the marine quality I found in Rodia’s work.Down in the basement (he had to go there too) he was very much struck by myfather’s floor-set “Gate of Dreams” stone carving and studied it longer than anyof the others. (I’d been feeling embarrassed about its bold motto and oddplacement.) Finally he indicated the octopus eyes staring over the castle andobserved, “Cutlu, perchance?”It was the first reference of any sort to the research project that either of ushad made since our meeting and it shook me strangely, but he appeared not tonotice and continued with, “You know, Mr. Fischer, I’m tempted to get a readingwith Atwood and Pabodie’s infernal black box right here. Would you object?”I told him certainly not and to go right ahead, but warned him there was onlysolid rock under the house (I had told him about my father’s dowsing and evenhad mentioned Harley Warren, whom it turned out Wilmarth had heard of through aRandolph Carter).He nodded, but said, “I’ll take a shot at it nonetheless. We must startsomewhere, you know,” and he proceeded to set up the geo-scanner carefully so itwas standing vertically on its three stubby legs right in the middle of thecarving. He took off his shoes first so as not to risk damaging the rather finestonework.Then he opened the top of the geo-scanner. I glimpsed two dials and a largeeyepiece. He knelt and applied his eye to it, drawing out a black hood anddraping it over his head, very much like an old-fashioned photographer focusingfor a picture. “Pardon me, but the indications I must look for are difficult tosee,” he said muffledly. “Hello, what’s this?”There was a longish pause during which nothing happened except his shouldersshifted a bit and there were a few faint clicks. Then he emerged from under thehood, tucked it back in the black box, closed the latter, and began to put onand relace his shoes.“The scanner’s gone crankish,” he explained in answer to my inquiry, “and isseeing ghost vacuities. But not to worry—it only needs new warm-up cells, Ifancy, which I have with me, and will be right as rain for tomorrow’sexpedition! That is, if—?” He rolled his eyes up at me in smiling inquiry.“Of course I’ll be able to show you my pet trails in the hills,” I assured him.“In fact, I’m bursting to.”“Capital!” he said heartily.But as we left the basement, its rock floor rang out a bit hollowly, it soundedto me, under his high-laced leather-soled and -heeled shoes (I was wearingsneakers).It was getting dark, so I started dinner after giving him some iced tea, whichhe took with lots of lemon and sugar. I cooked eggs and small beefsteaks,figuring from his haggard looks he needed the most restorative sort of food. Ialso built a fire in the big fireplace against the almost invariable chill ofevening.As we ate by its dancing, crackling flames, he regaled me with brief impressionsof his trip west—the cold, primeval pine woods of southern New Jersey with theirsomberly clad inhabitants speaking an almost Elizabethan English; the verynarrow dark roads of West Virginia; the freezing waters of the Ohio floodingunruffled, silent, battleship gray, and ineffably menacing under lowering skies;the profound silence of Mammoth Cave; the southern Midwest with itsDepression-spawned, but already legendary, bank robbers; the nervous Creolecharms of New Orleans’s restored French Quarter; the lonely, incredibly longstretches of road in Texas and Arizona that made one believe one was seeinginfinity; the great, long, blue, mystery-freighted Pacific rollers (“sodifferent from the Atlantic’s choppier, shorter-spaced waves”) which he’dwatched with George Goodenough Akeley, who’d turned out to be a very solid chapand knowing more about his father’s frightening Vermont researches than Wilmarthhad expected.When I mentioned finding The Shadow Over Innsmouth he nodded and murmured, “Theoriginal of its youthful hero has disappeared and his cousin from the Cantonasylum. Down to Y’ha-nthlei? Who knows?” But when I remembered his accumulatedmail he merely nodded his thanks, wincing a little, as though reluctant to faceit. He really did look shockingly tired.When we’d finished dinner, however, and he’d taken his black coffee (also withlots of sugar) and the fire was dancing flickeringly, both yellow and blue now,he turned to me with a little, venturesomely friendly smile and a big,wonderingly wide lifting of his eyebrows, and said quietly, “And now you’llquite rightly be expecting me to tell you, my dear Fischer, all the things aboutthe project that I’ve been hesitant to write, the answers I’ve been reluctant togive to your cogent questions, the revelations I’ve been putting off makinguntil we should meet in person. Really, you have been very patient, and I thankyou.”Then he shook his head thoughtfully, his eyes growing distant, as he slowly andrather sinuously and somehow unwillingly shrugged his shoulders, whichparadoxically were both frail and wide, and grimaced slightly, as if tastingsomething strangely bitter, and said even more quietly, “if only I had more totell you that’s been definitely proved. Somehow we always stop just short ofthat. Oh, the artifacts are real enough and certain—the Innsmouth jewelry, theAntarctic soapstones, Blake’s Shining Trapezohedron, though that’s lost inNarragansett Bay, the spiky baluster knob Walter Gilman brought back from hiswitchy dreamland (or the nontemporal fourth dimension, if you prefer), even theunknown elements, meteoric and otherwise, which defy all analysis, even the newmagneto-optic probe which has given us virginium and alabamine. And it’s almostequally certain that all, or almost all, those weird extraterrestrial andextra-cosmic creatures have existed—that’s why I wanted you to read theLovecraft stories, despite their lurid extravagances, so you’d have some pictureof the entities that I’d be talking to you about. Except that they and theevidence for them do have a maddening way of vanishing upon extinction and fromall records—Wilbur Whateley’s mangled remains, his brother’s vast invisiblecadaver, the Plutonian old Akeley killed and couldn’t photograph, the June 1882meteor itself which struck Nahum Gardner’s farm and which set old Armitage(young then) studying the Necronomicon (the start of everything at Miskatonic)and which Atwood’s father saw with his own eyes and tried to analyze, or whatDanforth saw down in Antarctica when he looked back at the horrible highermountains beyond the Mountains of Madness—he’s got amnesia for that now that hehas regained his sanity … all, all gone!“But whether any of those creatures exist today—there, there’s the rub! Theoverwhelming question we can’t answer, though always on the edge of doing so.The thing is,” he went on with gathering urgency, “that if they do exist, theyare so unimaginably powerful and resourceful, they might be”—and he lookedaround sharply—”anywhere at the moment!“Take Cthulhu,” he began.I couldn’t help starting as I heard that word pronounced for the first time inmy life; the harsh, dark, abysmal monosyllabic growl it came to was so very likethe sound that had originally come to me from my imagination, or mysubconscious, or my otherwise unremembered dreams, or.…He continued, “If Cthulhu exists, then he (or she, or it) can go anywhere hewants through space, or air, or sea, or earth itself. We know from Johansen’saccount (it turned his hair white) that Cthulhu can exist as a gas, be torn toatoms, and then recombine. He wouldn’t need tunnels to go through solid rock, hecould seep through it—‘not in the spaces we know, but between them.’ And yet inhis inscrutability he might choose tunnels—there’s that to be reckoned with.Or—still another possibility—perhaps he neither exists nor does not exist but isin some half state—‘waits dreaming,’ as Angell’s old chant has it. Perhaps hisdreams, incarnated as your winged worms, Fischer, dig tunnels.“It is those monstrous underground cavern-and-tunnel worlds, not all fromCthulhu by any means, that I have been assigned to investigate with thegeo-scanner, partly because I was the first to hear of them from old Akeley andalso—Merciful Creator!—from the Plutonian who masked as him—‘great worlds ofunknown life down there; blue-litten K’n-yan, red-litten Yoth, and black,lightless N’kai,’ which was Tsathoggua’s home, and even stranger inner spaceslitten by colors from space and from Earth’s nighted core. That’s how I guessedthe colors in your childhood dreams or nightmares (or personality exchanges), mydear Fischer. I’ve glimpsed them also in the geo-scanner, where they are,however, most fugitive and difficult to discern.…”His voice trailed off tiredly, just as my own concern became most feverishlyintense with his mention of “personality exchanges.”He really did look shockingly fatigued. Nevertheless I felt impelled to nervemyself to say, “Perhaps those dreams can be repeated, if I take Dr. Morgan’sdrug. Why not tonight?”“Out of the question,” he replied, shaking his head slowly. “In the first place,I wrote too hopefully there. At the last minute Morgan was unable to supply mewith the drug. He promised to send it along by mail, but hasn’t yet. In thesecond place, I’m inclined to think now that it would be much too dangerous anexperiment.”“But at least you’ll be able to check those dream colors and the tunnels withyour geo-scanner?” I pressed on, somewhat crestfallen.“If I can repair it …” he said, his head nodding and slumping to one side. Thedying flames were all blue now as he whispered mumblingly, “… if I am permittedto repair it.…”I had to help him to bed and then retire to my own, shaken and unsatisfied, mymind a-whirl. Wilmarth’s alternating moods of breezy optimism and a seeminglyfrightened dejection were hard to adjust to. But now I realized that I was verytired myself—after all, I’d been up most of the previous night readingInnsmouth—and soon I slumbered.(The voices stridently groan, “The pit of primal life, the Yellow Sign,Azathoth, the Magnum Innominandum, the shimmering violet and emerald wings, thecerulean and vermilion claws, Great Cthulhu’s wasps …” Night has fallen. I havelimpingly paced the house from the low attic with its circular portholes to thebasement, where I touched my father’s sledge and eyed “The Gate of Dreams.” Themoment draws nigh. I must write rapidly.)I awoke to bright sunlight, feeling totally refreshed by my customary twelvehours of sleep. I found Wilmarth busily writing at the table that faced thenorth window of his bedroom. His smiling face looked positively youthful in thecool light, despite its neatly brushed thatch of white hair—I hardly recognizedhim. All his accumulated mail except for one item lay open and face downward onthe far-left-hand corner of the table, while on the far-right-hand corner was animpressive pile of newly written and addressed postcards, each with its neatlyaffixed, fresh, one-cent stamp.“Good morrow, Georg,” he greeted me (properly pronouncing it GAY-org), “if I mayso address you. And good news!—the scanner is recharged and behaving perfectly,ready for the day’s downward surveying, while that letter George Goodenoughforwarded is from Francis Morgan and contains a supply of the drug againsttonight’s inward researches! Two dosages exactly—Georg, I’ll dream with you!” Hewaved a small paper packet.“That’s wonderful, Albert,” I told him, meaning it utterly. “By the way, it’s mybirthday,” I added.“Congratulations!” he said joyfully. “We’ll celebrate it tonight with our draftsof Morgan’s drug.”And our expedition did turn out to be a glorious one, at least until almost itsvery end. The Hollywood Hills put on their most youthfully winning face; eventhe underlying crumbling, worm-eaten corruptions seemed fresh. The sun was hot,the sky bright blue, but there was a steady cool breeze from the west andoccasional great high white clouds casting enormous shadows. Amazingly, Albertseemed to know the territory almost as well as I did—he’d studied his mapsprodigiously and brought them along, including the penciled ones I’d sent him.And he instantly named correctly the manzanita, sumac, scrub oak, and otherencroaching vegetation through which we wended our way.Every so often and especially at my favorite pausing places, he would takereadings with the geo-scanner, which he carried handily, while I had twocanteens and a small backpack. While his head was under the black hood, I wouldstand guard, my stick ready. Once I surprised a dark and pinkly pale, fat, largeserpent, which went slithering into the underbrush. Before I could tell him, hesaid correctly, “A king snake, foe of the crotaloids—a good omen.”And … on every reading, Albert’s black box showed vacuities of some sort—tunnelsor caves—immediately below us, at depths varying from a few to a few scoremeters. Somehow this did not trouble us by bright outdoor day. I think it waswhat we’d both been expecting. Coming out from under the hood, he’d merely nodand say, “Fifteen meters” (or the like) and note it down in his little book, andwe’d tramp on. Once he let me try my luck under the hood, but all I could seethrough the eyepiece was what seemed like an intensification of the dancingpoints of colored light one sees in the dark with the eyes closed. He told me ittook considerable training to learn to recognize the significant indications.High in the Santa Monicas we lunched on beef sandwiches and the tea-flavoredlemonade with which I’d filled both canteens. Sun and breeze bathed us. Hillswere all around and beyond them to the west the blue Pacific. We talked of SirFrancis Drake and Magellan and of Captain Cook and his great circumpolarvoyagings, and of the fabulous lands they’d all heard legends of—and of how thetunnels we were tracing were really no more strange. We spoke of Lovecraft’sstories almost as if they were no more than that. Daytime viewpoints can bestrangely unworrying and unconcerned.Halfway back or so, Albert began looking very haggard once more—frighteninglyso. I got him to let me carry the black box. To do that I had to abandon my flatbackpack and empty canteens—he didn’t seem to notice.Almost home, we paused at my father’s memorial. The sun had westered most ofthis way, and there were dark shadows and also shafts of ruddy light almostparallel to the ground. Albert, very weary now, was fumbling for phrases topraise Rodia’s work, when there swiftly glided out of the undergrowth behind himwhat I first took to be a large rattlesnake. But as I lunged lurchingly towardit, lashing at it with my stick, and as it slid back into thick cover withpreternatural rapidity, and as Albert whirled around, the sinuous, vanishingthing looked for an instant to me as if it were all shimmering violet-greenabove with beating wings and bluish-scarlet below with claws while its minatoryrattle was more a skirling hum.We raced home, not speaking of it at all, each of us concerned only that hiscomrade not fall behind. Somewhere mine found the strength.His postcards had been collected from the box by the road and there were a halfdozen new letters for him—and a notification of a registered package for me.Nothing must do then but Albert must drive me down to Hollywood to pick up thepackage before the post office closed. His face was fearfully haggard, but heseemed suddenly flooded with a fantastic nervous energy and (when I protestedthat it could hardly be anything of great importance) a tremendous willpowerthat would brook no opposition.He drove like a veritable demon and as though the fate of worlds depended on hisspeed—Hollywood must have thought it was Wallace Reid come back from the deadfor another of his transcontinental racing pictures. The Tin Hind fled like afrightened one indeed, as he worked the gear lever smartly, shifting up anddown. The wonders were that we weren’t arrested and didn’t crash. But I got tothe proper window just before it closed and I signed for the package—a stoutlywrapped, tightly sealed, and heavily corded parcel from (it really startled me)Simon Rodia.Then back again, just as fast despite my protests, the Tin Hind screeching onthe corners and curves, my companion’s face an implacable, watchfuldeath’s-mask, up into the crumbling and desiccated hills as the last streaks ofthe day faded to violet in the west and the first stars came out.I forced Albert to rest then and drink hot black coffee freighted with sugarwhile I got dinner—when he’d stepped out of the car into the chilly night he’dalmost fainted. I grilled steaks again—if he’d needed restorative food lastnight, he needed it doubly now after our exhausting hike and our Dance of Deathalong the dry, twisting roads, I told him roughly. (“Or Grim Reaper’sTarantella, eh, Georg?” he responded with a feeble but unvanquishable littlegrin.)Soon he was prowling around again—he wouldn’t stay still—and peering out thewindows and then lugging the geo-scanner down into the basement, “to round outour readings,” he informed me. I had just finished building and lighting a bigfire in the fireplace when he came hurrying back up. Its first white flare offlame as the kindling caught showed me his ashen face and white-circled blueeyes. He was shaking all over, literally.“I’m sorry, Georg, to be such a troublesome and seemingly ungrateful guest,” hesaid, forcing himself with a great effort to speak coherently and calmly (thoughmost imperatively), “but really you and I must get out of here at once. There’sno place safe for us this side of Arkham—which is not safe either, but there atleast we’ll have the counsel and support of salted veterans of the Miskatonicproject whose nerves are steadier than mine. Last night I got (and concealedfrom you—I was sure it had to be wrong) a reading of fifteen down there underthe carving—centimeters, Georg, not meters. Tonight I have confirmed thatreading beyond any question of a doubt, only it’s shrunk to five under thecarving. The floor there is the merest shell—it rings as hollow as a crypt inNew Orleans’s St. Louis One or Two—they have been eating at it from below andare feasting still. No, no arguments! You have time to pack one small bag—limityourself to necessities, but bring that registered parcel from Rodia, I’mcurious about it.”And with that he strode to his bedroom, whence he emerged in a short while withhis packed valise and carried it and the black box out to the car.Meanwhile I’d nerved myself to go down in the basement. The floor did ring muchmore hollowly than it had last night—it made me hesitate to tread upon it—butotherwise nothing appeared changed. Nevertheless it gave me a curious feeling ofunreality, as if there were no real objects left in the world, only flimsyscenery, a few stage properties including a balsa sledgehammer, a registeredparcel with nothing in it, and a cyclorama of nighted hills, and two actors.I hurried back upstairs, took the steaks off the grill and set them on the tablein front of the softly roaring fire (for they were done), and headed afterAlbert.But he anticipated me, stepping back inside the door, looking at me sharply—hiseyes were still wide and staring—and demanding, “Why aren’t you packed?”I said to him steadily, “Now look here, Albert, I thought last night the cellarfloor sounded hollow, so that is not entirely a surprise. And any way you lookat it, we can’t drive to Arkham on nervous energy. In fact, we can’t get evendecently started driving east without some food inside us. You say yourself it’sdangerous everywhere, even at Miskatonic, and from what we (or at least I) sawat my father’s grave there may be at least one of the things loose already. Solet’s eat dinner—I have a hunch terror hasn’t taken away your appetiteentirely—and have a look inside Rodia’s package, and then leave if we must.”There was a rather long pause. Then his expression relaxed into a somewhat wansmile and he said, “Very well, Georg, that does make sense. I’m frightened allright, make no mistake of that, in fact I’ve walked in terror for the past tenyears. But in this case, to speak as honestly as I’m able, I have been even moreconcerned for you—it suddenly seemed such a pity, such a disservice, that Ishould have dragged you into this dreadful business. But as you say, one mustbow to necessity, bodily and otherwise … and try to show a little style aboutit,” he added with a rather doleful chuckle.So we sat down before the dancing, golden fire and ate our steaks and fixings (Ihad some burgundy, he stayed with his sweet black coffee) and talked of this andthat—chiefly of Hollywood, as it turned out. He’d glimpsed a bookstore on ourheadlong drive, and now he asked about it and that led to other things.Our dinner done, I refilled his cup and my glass, then cleared a space andopened Rodia’s parcel, using the carving knife to cut its cords and slit itsseals. It contained, carefully packed in excelsior, the casket of embossedcopper and German silver which sits before me now. I recognized my father’shandiwork at once, which reproduced quite closely in beaten metal his stonecarving in the basement, though without the “Gate of Dreams” inscription.Albert’s finger indicated the Cutlu eyes, though he did not speak the name. Iopened the casket. It contained several sheets of heavy bond paper. This time itwas my father’s handwriting I recognized. Standing side by side, Albert and Iread the document, which I append here:15 Mar 1925My dear Son:Today you are 13 but I write to you and wish you well when you are 25. Why I doso you will learn as you read this. The box is yours—Leb’ wohl! I leave it witha friend to send to you if I should go in the 12 years between—Nature has givenme signs that that may be: jagged flashes of rare earth colors in my eyes fromtime to time. Now read with care, for I am telling secrets.When I was a boy in Louisville I had dreams by day and could not remember them.They were black times in my mind that were minutes long, the longest half anhour. Sometimes I came to in another place and doing something different, butnever harmful. I thought my black daydreams were a weakness or a judgement, butNature was wise. I was not strong and did not know enough to bear them yet.Under my father’s rule I learned my craft and made my body strong and alwaysstudied when and as I could.When I was 25 I was deep in love—this was before your mother—with a beautifulgirl who died of consumption. Pining upon her grave I had a daydream, but thistime by the strength of my desire I kept my mind white. I swam down through theloam and I was joined with her in full bodily union. She said this coupling mustbe our last, but that I now would have the power to move at will under andthrough the earth from time to time. We kissed farewell forever, Lorchen and I,and I swam down and on, her knight of dreams, exulting in my strength like someold kobold breasting the rock. It is not black down there, my son, as one wouldthink. There are glorious colors. Water is blue, metals bright red and yellow,rocks green and brown, undsoweiter. After a time I swam back and up into mybody, standing on the new-made grave. I was no longer pining, but profoundlygrateful.So I learned how to divine, my son, to be a fish of earth when there is need andNature wills, to dive into the Hell of the Mountain King dancing with light.Always the finest colors and the strangest hues lay west. Rare earths they arenamed by scientists, who are wise, though blind. That’s why I brought us here.Under the greatest of oceans, earth is a rainbow web and Nature is a spiderspinning and walking it.And now you have shown you have my power, mein Sohn, but in a greater form. Youhave black nightdreams, I know, for I have sat by you as you slept and heard youtalk and seen your terror, which would soon destroy you if you could recall it,as one night showed. But Nature in her wisdom blindfolds you until you have theneeded strength and learning. As you know by now, I have provided for youreducation at a good Eastern school praised by Harley Warren, the finest employerthat I ever had, who knew a lot about the nether realms.And now you’re strong enough, mein Sohn, to act—and wise, I hope, as Nature’sacolyte. You’ve studied deep and made your body strong. You have the power andthe hour has come. The triton blows his horn. Rise up, mein lieber Georg, andfollow me. Now is the time. Build upon what I’ve built, but build more greatly.Yours is the wider and the greater realm. Make your mind white. With or withoutsome lovely woman’s help, now burst the gate of dreams!Your loving FatherAt any other time that document would have moved and shaken me profoundly. Truthto tell, it did so move and shake me, but I had been already so moved and shakenby today’s climactic events that my first thought was of how the letter appliedto them.I echoed from the letter, “Now burst the gate of dreams,” and then added,suppressing another interpretation, “That means I should take Morgan’s drugtonight. Let’s do it, Albert, as you proposed this morning.”“Your father’s last command,” he said heavily, clearly much impressed by thataspect of the letter. Then, “Georg, this is a most fantastic, shatteringmissive! That sign he got—sounds like migraine. And his references to therare-earth elements—that could be crucial. And colors in the earth perceivedperhaps by extrasensory perception! The Miskatonic project should have startedinvestigating dowsing years ago. We’ve been blind—” He broke off. “You’re right,Georg, and I am strongly tempted. But the danger! How to choose? On the one handa supreme parental injunction and our raging curiosities—for mine’s a-boil. Onthe other hand Great Cthulhu and his minions. Oh, for an indication of how todecide!”There was a sharp knocking at the door. We both started. After a moment’s pauseI moved rapidly, Albert following. With my hand on the latch I paused again. Ihad not heard a car stop outside. Through the stout oak came the cry,“Telegram!” I opened it.There was revealed a skinny, somewhat jaunty-looking youth of pale complexionscattered with big freckles and with carrot red hair under his visored cap. Histrousers were wrapped tightly around his legs by bicycle clips.“Either of you Albert N. Wilmarth?” he inquired coolly.“I am he,” Albert said, stepping forward.“Then sign for this, please.”Albert did so and tipped him, substituting a dime for a nickel at the lastinstant.The youth grinned widely, said, “G’night,” and sauntered off. I closed the doorand turned quickly back.Albert had torn open the flimsy envelope and drawn out and spread the missive.He was pale already, but as his eyes flashed across it, he grew paler still. Itwas as if he were two-thirds of a ghost already and its message had made him afull one. He held the yellow sheet out to me wordlessly:LOVECRAFT IS DEAD STOP THE WHIPPOORWILLS DID NOT SING STOP TAKE COURAGE STOPDANFORTHI looked up. Albert’s face was still as ghostly white, but its expression hadchanged from uncertainty and dread to decision and challenge.“That tips the balance,” he said. “What have I more to lose? By George, Georg,we’ll have a look down into the abyss on whose edge we totter. Are you game?”“I proposed it,” I said. “Shall I fetch your valise from the car?”“No need,” he said, whipping from his inside breast pocket the small paperpacket from Dr. Morgan he’d shown me that morning. “I had the hunch that we weregoing to use it, until that apparition at your father’s tomb shattered mynerves.”I fetched small glasses. He split evenly between them the small supply of whitepowder, which dissolved readily in the water I added under his direction. Thenhe looked at me quizzically, holding his glass as if for a toast.“No question of to whom we drink this,” I said, indicating the telegram he wasstill holding in his other hand.He winced slightly. “No, don’t speak his name. Let’s rather drink to all ourbrave comrades who have perished or suffered greatly in the Miskatonic project.”That “our” really warmed me. We touched glasses and drained them. The draft wasfaintly bitter.“Morgan writes that the effects are quite rapid,” he said. “First drowsiness,then sleep, and then hopefully dreams. He’s tried it twice himself with Rice anddoughty old Armitage, who laid the Dunwich Horror with him. The first time theyvisited in dream Gilman’s Walpurgis hyperspace; the second, the inner city atthe two magnetic poles—an area topologically unique.”Meanwhile I’d hurriedly poured a little more wine and lukewarm coffee and we’dsettled ourselves comfortably in our easy chairs before the fire, the dancingflames of which became both a little blurred and a little dazzling as the drugbegan to take effect.“Really, that was a most amazing missive from your father,” he chatted onrapidly. “Spinning a rainbow web under the Pacific, the lines those weirdlylitten tunnels—truly most vivid. Would Cthulhu be the spider? No, by Gad, I’dliefer your father’s goddess Nature any day. She’s kindlier at least.”“Albert,” I said somewhat drowsily, thinking of personality exchanges, “couldthose creatures possibly be benign, or at least less malevolent than weinfer?—as my father’s subterranean visionings might indicate. My winged worms,even?”“Most of our comrades did not find them so,” he replied judiciously, “though ofcourse there’s our Innsmouth hero. What has he really found in Y’ha-nthlei?Wonder and glory? Who knows? Who can say he knows? Or old Akeley out in thestars—is his brain suffering the tortures of the damned in its shining metalcylinder? Or is it perpetually exalted by ever-changing true visions ofinfinity? And what did poor shoggoth-stampeded Danforth really think he sawbeyond the two horrific mountain chains down there before he got amnesia? And isthat last a blessing or a curse? Gad, he and I are suited to each other … themind-smitten helping the nerve-shattered … fit nurses for felines.…”“That was surely heavy news he sent you,” I observed with a little yawn,indicating the telegram about Lovecraft, which he still held tightly betweenfinger and thumb. “You know, before that wire came, I had the craziest idea—thatsomehow you and he were the same person. I don’t mean Danforth but—”“Don’t say it!” he said sharply. Then his voice went immediately drowsy as hecontinued, “But the roster of the perished is longer far … poor Lake and poor,poor Gedney and all those others under their Southern Cross and Magellanicshroud … the mathematical genius Walter Gilman who lost heart mostterribly … the nonagenarian street-slain Angell and lightning-frozen Blake inProvidence … Edward Pickman Derby, Arkham’s plump Shelley deliquescing in hiswitch-wife’s corpse.… Gad, this is hardly the cheerfulest topic.… You know,Georg, down in San Diego young Akeley (G.G.) showed me a hidden sea-cave bluerthan Capri and on its black beach of magnetite the webbed footprint of amerman … one of the Gnorri?… and then … oh yes, of course … there’s WilburWhateley, who was almost nine feet tall … though he hardly counts as aMiskatonic researcher … but the whippoorwills didn’t get him either … or his bigbrother.…”I was still looking at the fire, and the dancing points of light in and aroundit had become the stars, thick as the Pleiades and Hyades, through which oldAkeley journeyed eternally, when unconsciousness closed on me too, black as thewind-stirred, infinite gulf of darkness which Robert Blake saw in the ShiningTrapezohedron, black as N’kai.I awoke stiff and chilled. The fire at which I’d been staring was white ashesonly. I felt a sharp pang of disappointment that I had not dreamed at all. ThenI became aware of the low, irregular, inflected humming or buzzing that filledmy ears.I stood up with difficulty. My companion slumbered still, but his shut-eyed,death-pale face had a hideously tormented look and he writhed slowly andagonizedly from time to time as if in the grip of foulest nightmare. The yellowtelegram had fallen from his fingers and lay on the floor. As I approached him Irealized that the sound filling my ears was coming from between his lips, whichwere unceasingly a-twitch, and as I leaned my head close to them, the horridlyarticulate droning became recognizable words and phrases:“The pulpy, tentacled head,” I heard in horror, “Cthulhu fhtagn, the wronggeometry, the polarizing miasma, the prismatic distortion, Cthulhu R’lyeh, thepositive blackness, the living nothingness …”I could not bear to watch his dreadful agony or listen to those poisonous,twangy words an instant longer, so I seized him by the shoulders and shook himviolently, though even as I did so there sprang into my mind my father’s sterninjunction never to do so.His eyes came open wide in his white face and his mouth clamped shut as he cameup with a powerful shove of his bent arms against the chair’s arms which hishands had been clutching. It was as if it were happening in slow motion, thoughparadoxically it also seemed to be happening quite swiftly. He gave me a lastmute look of utter horror and then he turned and ran, taking fantastically longstrides, out through the door, which his outstretched hand threw wide ahead ofhim, and disappeared into the night.I hobbled after him as swiftly as I could. I heard the motor catch at thestarter’s second prod. I screamed, “Wait, Albert, wait!” As I neared the TinHind, its lights flashed on and its motor roared and I was engulfed in acridexhaust fumes as it screeched out the drive with a spattering of gravel and downthe first curve.I waited there then in the cold until all sight and sound of it had vanished inthe night, which was already paling a little with the dawn.And then I realized that I was still hearing those malignant, gloating, evillyresonant voices.“Cthulhu fhtagn,” they were saying (and have been saying and are saying now andwill forever), “the spider tunnels, the black infinities, the colors inpitch-darkness, the tiered towers of Yuggoth, the glittering centipedes, thewinged worms.…”Somewhere not far off I heard a low, half-articulate whirring sound.I went back into the house and wrote this manuscript.And now I shall place the last with its interleafed communications and also thetwo books of poetry that led to all this in the copper and German silver casket,and I shall carry that with me down into the basement, where I shall take up myfather’s sledge (wondering in which body I shall survive, if at all) andliterally carry out his last letter’s last injunction.* * *Very early on the morning of Tuesday, March 16, 1937, the householders ofParadise Crest (then Vultures Roost) were disturbed by a clashing rumble andsharp earth-shock which they attributed to an earthquake, and indeed very smalltremors were registered at Griffith Observatory, UCLA, and USC, though on noother seismographs. Daylight revealed that the brick house locally known asFischer’s Folly had fallen in so completely that not one brick remained joinedto another. Moreover, there appeared to be fewer bricks in view than the housewould have accounted for, as if half of them had been trucked away during thenight, or else fallen into some great space beneath the basement. In fact, theappearance of the ruin was of a gigantic ant lion’s-pit lined by bricks insteadof sand grains. The place was deemed, and actually was, dangerous, and wasshortly filled in and in part cemented over, and apparently not long afterwardrebuilt upon.The body of the owner, a quietly spoken, crippled young man named Georg ReuterFischer, was discovered flat on its face in the edge of the rubble with handsthrown out (the metal casket by one of them) as though he had been trying toflee outdoors when caught by the collapse. His death, however, was attributed toa slightly earlier accident or insane act of self-destruction involving acid, ofwhich his eccentric father was once known to have kept a supply. It was wellthat easy identification was made possible by his conspicuously twisted rightfoot, for when the body was turned over it was discovered that something hadeaten away the entire front of his face and also those portions of his skull andjaw and the entire forebrain.* Originally published in The Disciples of Cthulhu, 1976."},{"pageContent":"RISING WITH SURTSEY*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]BRIAN LUMLEY[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]It appears that with the discovery of a live coelacanth—a fish thought to havebeen extinct for over seventy millions of years—we may have to revise ourestablished ideas of the geological life spans of certain aquatic animals.…—LINKAGE’S WONDERS OF THE DEEPSurname —Haughtree Christian Names —Phillip Date of Birth —2 Dec 1927 Age(years) —35 Place of Birth —Old Beldry, Yorks. Address —Not applicableOccupation —AuthorWHO STATES: (Let here follow the body of the statement)I have asked to be cautioned in the usual manner but have been told that in viewof my alleged condition it is not necessary.… The implication is obvious, andbecause of it I find myself obliged to begin my story in the following way:I must clearly impart to the reader—before advising any unacquainted perusal ofthis statement—that I was never a fanatical believer in the supernatural. Norwas I ever given to hallucinations or visions, and I have never suffered from mynerves or been persecuted by any of the mental illnesses. There is no record tosupport any evidence of madness in any of my ancestors—and Dr. Stewart was quitewrong to declare me insane.It is necessary that I make these points before permitting the reading of this,for a merely casual perusal would soon bring any conventionally minded reader tothe incorrect conclusion that I am either an abominable liar or completely outof my mind, and I have little wish to reinforce Dr. Stewart’s opinions.…Yet I admit that shortly after midnight on the 15th November 1963 the body of mybrother did die by my hand; but at the same time I must clearly state that I amnot a murderer. It is my intention in the body of this statement—which will ofnecessity be long, for I insist I must tell the whole story—to proveconclusively my innocence. For, indeed, I am guilty of no heinous crime, andthat act of mine which terminated life in the body of my brother was nothing butthe reflex action of a man who had recognized a hideous threat to the sanity ofthe whole world. Wherefore, and in the light of the allegation of madnessleveled against me, I must now attempt to tell this tale in the most detailedfashion; I must avoid any sort of garbled sequence and form my sentences andparagraphs with meticulous care, refraining from even thinking on the end of ituntil that horror is reached.…Where best to start?If I may quote Sir Amery Wendy-Smith:There are fabulous legends of Star-Born creatures who inhabited this Earth manymillions of years before Man appeared and who were still here, in certain blackplaces, when he eventually evolved. They are, I am sure, to an extent here evennow.It may be remembered that those words were spoken by the eminent antiquary andarchaeologist before he set out upon his last, ill-fated trip into the interiorof Africa. Sir Amery was hinting, I know, at the same breed of hell-spawnedhorror which first began to make itself apparent to me at that ghastly timeeighteen months ago; and I take this into account when I remember the way inwhich he returned, alone and raving, from that dark continent to civilization.At that time my brother Julian was just the opposite of myself, insofar as hewas a firm believer in dark mysteries. He read omnivorously of fearsome booksuncaring whether they were factual—as Frazer’s Golden Bough and Miss Murray’sWitch-Cult—or fanciful—like his collection of old, nigh-priceless volumes ofWeird Tales and similar popular magazines. Many friends, I imagine, willconclude that his original derangement was due to this unhealthy appetite forthe monstrous and the abnormal. I am not of such an opinion, of course, though Iadmit that at one time I was.Of Julian: he had always been a strong person physically, but had never shownmuch strength of character. As a boy he had had the size to easily take on anybully—but never the determination. This was also where he failed as a writer,for while his plots were good he was unable to make his characters live. Beingwithout personality himself, it was as though he was only able to reflect hisown weaknesses into his work. I worked in partnership with him, filling in plotsand building life around his more or less clay figures. Up until the time ofwhich I write, we had made a good living and had saved a reasonable sum. Thiswas just as well, for during the period of Julian’s illness, when I hardly wrotea word, I might well have found myself hard put to support both my brother andmyself. Fortunately, though sadly, he was later taken completely off my hands;but that was after the onset of his trouble.…It was in May 1962 that Julian suffered his actual breakdown, but the start ofit all can be traced back to the 2nd of February of that year—Candlemas—a datewhich I know will have special meaning to anyone with even the slightestschooling in the occult. It was on that night that he dreamed his dream oftitanic basalt towers—dripping with slime and ocean ooze and fringed with greatsea-mats—their weirdly proportioned bases buried in grey-green muck and theirnon–Euclidean-angled parapets fading into the watery distances of that unquietsubmarine realm.At the time we were engaged upon a novel of eighteenth-century romance, and Iremember we had retired late. Still later I was awakened by Julian’s screams,and he roused me fully to listen to an hysterical tale of nightmare. He babbledof what he had seen lurking behind those monolithic, slimy ramparts, and Iremember remarking—after he had calmed himself somewhat—what a strange fellow hewas, to be a writer of romances and at the same time a reader and dreamer ofhorrors. But Julian was not so easily chided, and such was his fear and loathingof the dream that he refused to lie down again that night but spent theremaining hours of darkness sitting at his typewriter in the study with everylight in the house ablaze.One would think that a nightmare of such horrible intensity might have persuadedJulian to stop gorging himself with his nightly feasts of at least two hours ofgruesome reading. Yet, if anything, it had the opposite effect—but now hisstudies were all channeled in one certain direction. He began to take a morbidinterest in anything to do with oceanic horror, collecting and avidly readingsuch works as the German Unter-Zee Kulten, Gaston le Fe’s Dwellers in theDepths, Gantley’s Hydrophinnae, and the evil Cthaat Aquadingen by an unknownauthor. But it was his collection of fictional books which in the main claimedhis interest. From these he culled most of his knowledge of the CthulhuMythos—which he fervently declared was not myth at all—and often expressed adesire to see an original copy of the Necronomicon of the mad Arab AbdulAlhazred, as his own copy of Feery’s Notes was practically useless, merelyhinting at what Julian alleged Alhazred had explained in detail.In the following three months our work went badly. We failed to make a deadlineon a certain story and, but for the fact that our publisher was a personalfriend, might have suffered a considerable loss financially. It was all due tothe fact that Julian no longer had the urge to write. He was too taken up withhis reading to work and could no longer even be approached to talk over storyplots. Not only this, but that fiendish dream of his kept returning with everincreasing frequency and vividness. Every night he suffered those samesilt-submerged visions of obscene terrors the like of which could only beglimpsed in such dark tomes as were his chosen reading. But did he reallysuffer? I found myself unable to make up my mind. For as the weeks passed, mybrother seemed to become all the more uneasy and restless by day, whilst eagerlyembracing the darkening skies of evening and the bed in which he sweated out thehorrors of hideous dream and nightmare.…We were leasing, for a reasonable monthly sum, a moderate house in Glasgow wherewe had separate bedrooms and a single study which we shared. Although he nowlooked forward to them, Julian’s dreams had grown even worse and they had beenparticularly bad for two or three nights when, in the middle of May, ithappened. He had been showing an increasing interest in certain passages in theCthaat Aquadingen and had heavily underscored a section in that book which ranthus:Rise!O Nameless Ones:That in Thy SeasonThine Own of Thy choosing.Through Thy Spells and Thy Magic,Through Dreams and Enchantry,May know of Thy Coming;And rush to Thy Pleasure,For the Love of Our Master,Knight of Cthulhu,Deep Slumberer in Green,Othuum …This and other bits and pieces culled from various sources, particularly certainpartly suppressed writings by a handful of authors, all allegedly “missingpersons” or persons who had died in strange circumstances—namely: Andrew Phelan,Abel Keane, Claiborne Boyd, Nayland Colum, and Horvath Blayne—had had a mostunsettling effect upon my brother, so that he was close to exhaustion when heeventually retired late on the night that the horror really started. Hiscondition was due to the fact that he had been studying his morbid books almostcontinually for a period of three days, and during that time had taken onlybrief snatches of sleep—and then only during the daylight hours, never at night.He would answer, if ever I attempted to remonstrate with him, that he did notwant to sleep at night “when the time is so near” and that “there was so muchthat would be strange to him in Deeps.” Whatever that was supposed to mean.…After he had retired that night I worked on for an hour or so before going tobed myself. But before leaving our study I glanced at that with which Julian hadlast been so taken up, and I saw—as well as the above nonsense, as I thenconsidered it—some jottings copied from the Life of St. Brendan by thesixth-century Abbot of Clonfert in Galway:All that day the brethren, even when they were no longer in view of the island,heard a loud wailing from the inhabitants thereof, and a noisome stench wasperceptible at a great distance. Then St. Brendan sought to animate the courageof the brethren, saying: “Soldiers of Christ, be strong in faith unfeigned andin the armour of the spirit, for we are now on the confines of hell!”I have since studied the Life of St. Brendan, and have found that which made meshudder in awful recognition—though at the reading I could not correlate thewritten word and my hideous disquiet; there was just something in the book whichwas horribly disturbing—and, moreover, I have found other references to historicoceanic eruptions; namely, those which sank Atlantis and Mu, those recorded inthe Liber Miraculorem of the monk and chaplain Herbert of Clairvaux in France inthe years 1178–80, and that which was closer to the present and which is knownonly through the medium of the suppressed Johansen Narrative. But at the time ofwhich I write, such things only puzzled me and I could never, not even in mywildest dreams, have guessed what was to come.I am not sure how long I slept that night before I was eventually roused byJulian and half awoke to find him crouching by my bed, whispering in thedarkness. I could feel his hand gripping my shoulder, and though I was onlyhalf-awake I recall the pressure of that strong hand and something of what hesaid. His voice had the trance-like quality of someone under deep hypnosis, andhis hand jerked each time he put emphasis on a word.“They are preparing.… They will rise.… They have not mustered The Greater Power,nor have they the blessing of Cthulhu, and the rising will not be permanent norgo recorded.… But the effort will suffice for the Mind-Transfer.… For the Gloryof Othuum …“Using those Others in Africa, those who took Sir Amery Wendy-Smith,Shudde-M’ell and his hordes, to relay their messages and dream-pictures, theyhave finally defeated the magic spell of deep water and can now control dreamsas of old—despite the oceans which cover them! Once more they have mastery ofdreams, but to perform the Transfer they need not even break the surface of thewater—a lessening of the pressure will suffice.“Ce’haie, ce’haie!!!“They rise even now; and He knows me, searching me out.… And my mind, which theyhave prepared in dreams, will be here to meet Him, for I am ready and they needwait no longer. My ignorance is nothing—I do not need to know or understand!They will show me; as, in dreams, they have showed me the Deep Places. But theyare unable to draw from my weak mind, or from any mortal brain, knowledge of thesurface.… The mental images of men are not strongly enough transmitted.… And thedeep water—even though, through the work of Shudde-M’ell, they have mostlyconquered its ill effects—still interferes with those blurred images which theyhave managed to obtain.…“I am the chosen one.… Through His eyes in my body will they again acquaintthemselves entirely with the surface; that in time, when the stars are right,they may perform the Great Rising.… Ah! The Great Rising! The damnation ofHastur! The dream of Cthulhu for countless ages … When all the deep dwellers,the dark denizens, the sleepers in silted cities, will again confound the worldwith their powers.…“For that is not dead which can lie forever, and when mysterious times havepassed, it shall be again as it once was.… Soon, when the Transfer is done, Heshall walk the Earth in my guise, and I the great deeps in His! So that wherethey ruled before they may one day rule again—aye—even the brethren ofYibb-Tstll and the sons of dreaming Cthulhu and their servants—for the Glory ofR’lyeh.…”That is as much of it as I can remember, and even then not at all clearly, andas I have said, it was nothing to me at that time but gibberish. It is onlysince then that I have acquainted myself with certain old legends and writings;and in particular, in connection with the latter part of my brother’s feveredmouthings, the inexplicable couplet of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred:“That is not dead which can eternal lie,And with strange aeons even death may die.”But I digress.It took me some time, after the drone of Julian’s outre monologue had died away,to realize that he was no longer in the room with me and that there was a chillmorning breeze blowing through the house. In his own room his clothes still hungneatly where he had left them the night before—but Julian had gone, leaving thedoor to the house swinging open.I dressed quickly and went out to search the immediate neighbourhood—withnegative results. Then, as dawn was breaking, I went into a police-station todiscover—to my horror—that my brother was in “protective custody.” He had beenfound wandering aimlessly through the northern streets of the city mumblingabout “giant Gods” waiting for something in the ocean deeps. He did not seem torealize that his sole attire was his dressing-gown, nor did he appear torecognize me when I was called to identify him. Indeed, he seemed to besuffering from the after-effects of some terrible shock which had left him in atrauma-like state, totally incapable of rational thought. He would only mumbleunguessable things and stare blankly towards the northern wall of his cell; anawful, mad light glowing in the back of his eyes.…My tasks were sufficient that morning to keep me amply occupied, and horriblyso; for Julian’s condition was such that on the orders of a police psychiatristhe was transferred from his police-station cell to Oakdeene Sanatorium for“observation.” Nor was it easy to get him attended to at the sanatorium.Apparently the supervisors of that institute had had their own share of troublethe previous night. When I did eventually get home, around noon, my firstthought was to check the daily newspapers for any reference to my brother’sbehaviour. I was glad, or as glad as I could be in the circumstances, to findthat Julian’s activities had been swamped from a more prominent place of curiousinterest—which they might well have otherwise claimed—by a host of far moreserious events.Strangely, those other events were similar to my brother’s trouble in that theyall seemed concerned with mental aberrations in previously normal people or, asat Oakdeene, increases in the activities of the more dangerous inmates oflunatic asylums all over the country. In London a businessman of some standinghad hurled himself bodily from a high roof declaring that he must “fly toYuggoth on the rim.” Chandler Davies, who later died raving mad at Woodholme,painted “in a trance of sheer inspiration” an evil black and grey G’harneLandscape which his outraged and frightened mistress set on fire upon itscompletion. Stranger still, a Cotswold rector had knifed to death two members ofhis congregation who, he later protested to the police, “had no right to exist,”and from the coast, near Harden in Durham, strange midnight swimmers had beenseen to make off with a fisherman who screamed of “giant frogs” beforedisappearing beneath the still sea.… It was as if, on that queer night, somemadness had descended—or, as I now believe, had risen—to blanket the moresusceptible minds of certain people with utter horror.But all these things, awful as they were, were not that which I found mostdisturbing. Looking back on what Julian had murmured in my bedroom while I layin half-slumber, I felt a weird and inexplicable chill sweep over me as I read,in those same newspapers, of an amateur seismologist who believed he had traceda submarine disturbance in the ocean between Greenland and the northern tip ofScotland.…What was it Julian had whispered about a rising which would not go recorded?Certainly something had been recorded happening in the depths of the sea!… But,of course, that was ridiculous, and I shook off the feeling of dread which hadgripped me on reading the item. Whatever that deep oceanic disturbance had been,its cause could only be coincidental to my brother’s behaviour.So it was that rather than ponder the reason for so many outre happenings thatill-omened night I thanked our lucky stars that Julian had got away with solight a mention in the press; for what had occurred could have been damaging toboth of us had it been given greater publicity.Not that any of this bothered Julian! Nothing bothered him, for he stayed inthat semi-conscious state in which the police had found him for well over ayear. During that year his weird delusions were of such a fantastic nature thathe became, as it were, the psychological pet and project of a well-known HarleyStreet alienist. Indeed, after the first month or so, so strong did the gooddoctor’s interest in my brother’s case become, he would accept no fee forJulian’s keep or treatment; and, though I visited Julian frequently, whenever Iwas in London, Dr. Stewart would never listen to my protests or hear of mepaying for his services. Such was his patient’s weird case that the doctordeclared himself extremely fortunate to be in a position where he had theopportunity to study such a fantastic mind. It amazes me now that the same manwho proved so understanding in his dealings with my brother should be so totallydevoid of understanding with me; yet that is the pass to which the turn ofevents has brought me. Still, it was plain my brother was in good hands, and inany case I could hardly afford to press the matter of payment; Dr. Stewart’sfees were usually astronomical.It was shortly after Dr. Stewart “took Julian in” that I began to study mybrother’s star-charts, both astronomical and astrological, and delved deep intohis books on the supernatural arts and sciences. I read many peculiar volumesduring that period and became reasonably familiar with the works of Fermold,Lévi, Prinn, and Gezrael, and—in certain darker reaches of the British Museum—Ishuddered to the literary lunacy of Magnus, Glynnd, and Alhazred. I read theR’lyeh Text and the Johansen Narrative and studied the fables of lost Atlantisand Mu. I crouched over flaking tomes in private collections and tracked downall sources of oceanic legend and myth with which I came into contact. I readthe manuscript of Andrew Phelan, the deposition of Abel Keane, the testament ofClaiborne Boyd, the statement of Nayland Colum, and the narrative of HorvathBlayne. The papers of Jefferson Bates fell to my unbelieving scrutiny, and I layawake at nights thinking of the hinted fate of Enoch Conger.And I need never have bothered.All the above delvings took the better part of a year to complete, by which timeI was no nearer a solution to my brother’s madness than when I began. No,perhaps that is not quite true. On reflection I think it quite possible that aman might go mad after exploring such dark avenues as these I have mentioned—andespecially a man such as Julian, who was more than normally sensitive to beginwith. But I was by no means satisfied that this was the whole answer. After all,his interest in such things had been lifelong; I could still see no reason whysuch an interest should suddenly accumulate so terribly. No, I was sure that thestart of it all had been that Candlemas dream.But at any rate, the year had not been totally lost. I still did not believe insuch things—dark survivals of elder times; great ancient gods waiting in theocean depths; impending doom for the human race in the form of nightmareocean-dwellers from the beginning of time—how could I and retain my own sanity?But I had become fairly erudite regards these darker mysteries of elder Earth.And certain facets of my strange research had been of particular interest to me.I refer to what I had read of the oddly similar cases of Joe Slater, theCatskill Mountains vagabond in 1900–01, Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee of MiskatonicUniversity in 1908–13, and Randolph Carter of Boston, whose disappearance in1928 was so closely linked with the inexplicable case of the Swami Chandraputrain 1930. True, I had looked into other cases of alleged demonic possession—allequally well authenticated—but those I have mentioned seemed to have a specialsignificance, as they paralleled more than roughly that case which I wasresearching and which involved so terribly my brother.But time had passed quickly and it was a totally unexpected shock to me, thoughone of immeasurable relief and pleasure, to find in my letter-box one Julymorning in 1963 a letter from Dr. Stewart which told of Julian’s rapidimprovement. My joy and amazement can well be imagined when, on journeying downto London the very next day, to the practice of Dr. Stewart, I found my brotherreturned—so far as could be ascertained in such a short time—to literallycomplete mental recovery. Indeed, it was the doctor himself who, on my arrival,informed me that Julian’s recovery was now complete, that my brother had fullyrecovered almost overnight: but I was not so sure—there appeared to be one ortwo anomalies.These apart, though, the degree of recovery which had been accomplished wastremendous. When I had last seen my brother, only a month earlier, I had feltphysically sickened by the unplumbed depths of his delusions. I had, on thatoccasion, gone to stand beside him at the barred window from which I was told healways stared blindly northwards, and in answer to my careful greeting he hadsaid: “Cthulhu, Othuum, Dagon; the Deep Ones in Darkness; all deeply dreaming,awaiting awakening …” Nor had I been able to extract anything from him at allexcept such senseless mythological jargon.What a transformation! Now he greeted me warmly—though I imagined hisrecognition of me to be a trifle slow—and after I had delightedly talked withhim for a while I came to the conclusion that so far as I could discern, andapart from one new idiosyncrasy, he seemed to be the same man I had known beforethe onset of the trouble. This oddity I have mentioned was simply that he seemedto have developed a weird photophobia and now wore large, shielded, dark-lensedspectacles which denied one the slightest glimpse of his eyes even from thesides. But, as I later found out, there was an explanation even for theseenigmatic-looking spectacles.While Julian prepared himself for the journey back to Glasgow, Dr. Stewart tookme to his study where I could sign the necessary release documents and where hecould tell me of my brother’s fantastic recovery. It appeared that one morningonly a week earlier, on going to his exceptional patient’s room, the doctor hadfound Julian huddled beneath his blankets. Nor would my brother come out orallow himself to be brought out until the doctor had agreed to bring him thatpair of very dark-lensed spectacles. Peculiar though this muffled request hadbeen, it had delighted the astonished alienist, constituting as it did the firstconscious recognition of existence that Julian had shown since the commencementof his treatment.And the spectacles had proved to be worth their weight in gold, for since theiradvent Julian had rapidly progressed to his present state of normalcy. The onlypoint over which the doctor seemed unhappy was that to date my brother hadpoint-blank refused to relinquish the things; he declared simply that the lighthurt his eyes! To some degree, however, the good doctor informed me, this wasonly to be expected. During his long illness Julian had departed so far from thenormal world, as it were, that his senses, unused, had partlyatrophied—literally ceasing to function. His recovery had left him in theposition of a man who, trapped in a dark cave for a long period of time, issuddenly released to face the bright outside world: which also explained in partthe clumsiness which had attended Julian’s every physical action during thefirst days of his recovery. One of the doctor’s assistants had found occasion toremark upon the most odd way in which my brother had tended to wrap his armsaround things which he wanted to lift or examine—even small things—as though hehad forgotten what his fingers were for! Also, at first, the patient had tendedto waddle rather than walk, almost in the manner of a penguin, and his recentlyreacquired powers of intelligent expression had lapsed at times in the queerestmanner—when his speech had degenerated to nothing more than a guttural, hissingparody of the English language. But all these abnormalities had vanished in thefirst few days, leaving Julian’s recovery as totally unexplained as had been hisdecline.In the first-class compartment on the London-Glasgow train, on our way north,having exhausted the more obvious questions I had wanted to put to my restoredbrother—questions to which, incidentally, his answers had seemed guardedlynoncommittal—I had taken out a pocketbook and started to read. After a fewminutes, startled by a passing train, I had happened to glance up … and wasimmediately glad that Julian and I were alone in the compartment. For my brotherhad obviously found something of interest in an old newspaper, and I do not knowwhat others might have thought of the look upon his face.… As he read his facebore an unpleasant and, yes, almost evil expression. It was made to look worseby those strange spectacles; a mixture of cruel sarcasm, black triumph, andtremendous contempt. I was taken aback, but said nothing, and later—when Julianwent into the corridor for a breath of fresh air—I picked up the newspaper andturned to the section he had been reading, which perhaps had caused the weirddistortion of his features. I saw at once what had affected him, and a shadow ofthe old fear flickered briefly across my mind as I read the article. It was notstrange that what I read was new to me—I had hardly seen a newspaper since thehorror began a year previously—but it was as though this was the same report Ihad read at that time. It was all there, almost a duplicate of the occurrencesof that night of evil omen: the increased activities of lunatics all over thecountry, the sudden mad and monstrous actions of previously normal people, thecult activity and devil-worship in The Midlands, the sea-things sighted offHarden on the coast, and more inexplicable occurrences in the Cotswolds.A chill as of strange ocean-floors touched my heart, and I quickly thumbedthrough the remaining pages of the paper—and almost dropped the thing when Icame across that which I had more than half expected. For submarine disturbanceshad been recorded in the ocean between Greenland and the northern tip ofScotland. And more—I instinctively glanced at the date at the top-center of thepage, and saw that the newspaper was exactly one week old.… It had firstappeared on the stands on the very morning when Dr. Stewart had found my brotherhuddled beneath the blankets in the room with the barred windows.Yet apparently my fears were groundless. On our return to the house in Glasgowthe first thing my brother did, to my great delight and satisfaction, wasdestroy all his old books of ancient lore and sorcery; but he made no attempt toreturn to his writing. Rather he mooned about the house like some lost soul, inwhat I imagined to be a mood of frustration over those mazed months of which hesaid he could remember nothing. And not once, until the night of his death, didI see him without those spectacles. I believe he even wore the things to bed—butthe significance of this, and something he had mumbled that night in my room,did not dawn on me until much later.But of those spectacles: I had been assured that this photophobia would wearoff, yet as the days went by it became increasingly apparent that Dr. Stewart’sassurances had gone for nothing. And what was I to make of that other change Ihad noticed? Whereas before Julian had been almost shy and retiring, with a weakchin and a personality to match, he now seemed to be totally out of character,in that he asserted himself over the most trivial things whenever theopportunity arose, and his face—his lips and chin in particular—had taken on afirmness completely alien to his previous physiognomy.It was all most puzzling, and as the weeks passed I became ever more aware thatfar from all being well with that altered brother of mine something wasseriously wrong. Apart from his brooding, a darker horror festered within him.Why would he not admit the monstrous dreams which constantly invaded his sleep?Heaven knows he slept little enough as it was; and when he did he often rousedme from my own slumbers by mumbling in the night of those same horrors which hadfeatured so strongly in his long illness.But then, in the middle of October, Julian underwent what I took to be a realchange for the better. He became a little more cheerful and even dabbled withsome old manuscripts long since left abandoned—though I do not think he did anyactual work on them—and towards the end of the month he sprang a surprise. Forquite some time, he told me, he had had a wonderful story in mind, but for thelife of him he could not settle to it. It was a tale he would have to work onhimself; and it would be necessary for him to do much research, as his materialwould have to be very carefully prepared. He asked that I bear with him duringthe period of his task and allow him as much privacy as our modest house couldafford. I agreed to everything he suggested, though I could not see why he foundit so necessary to have a lock put on his door; or, for that matter, why hecleared out the spacious cellar beneath the house “for future use.” Not that Iquestioned his actions. He had asked for privacy, and as far as I could assisthim he would have it. But I admit to having been more than somewhat curious.From then on I saw my brother only when we ate—which for him was not any toooften—and when he left his room to go to the library for books, a thing he didwith clockwork regularity every day. With the first few of these excursions Imade a point of being near the door of the house when he returned, for I waspuzzled as to what form his work was going to take and I thought I might perhapsgain some insight if I could see his books of reference.If anything, the materials Julian borrowed from the library only served to addto my puzzlement. What on Earth could he want with Lauder’s Nuclear Weapons andEngines, Schall’s X-Rays, Couderc’s The Wider Universe, Ubbelohde’s Man andEnergy, Keane’s Modern Marvels of Science, Stafford Clarke’s Psychiatry Today,Schubert’s Einstein, Geber’s The Electrical World, and all the many volumes ofThe New Scientist and The Progress of Science with which he returned each dayheavily burdened? Still, nothing he was doing gave me any cause to worry as Ihad in the old days, when his reading had been anything but scientific and hadinvolved those dreadful works which he had now destroyed. But my partial peaceof mind was not destined to last for very long.One day in mid-November—elated by a special success which I had achieved in thewriting of a difficult chapter in my own slowly shaping book—I went to Julian’sroom to inform him of my triumph. I had not seen him at all that morning, butthe fact that he was out did not become apparent until, after knocking andreceiving no reply, I entered his room. It had been Julian’s habit of late tolock his door when he went out, and I was surprised that on this occasion he hadnot done so. I saw then that he had left the door open purposely so that I mightsee the note he had left for me on his bedside table. It was scribbled on alarge sheet of white typing paper in awkward, tottering letters, and the messagewas blunt and to the point:Phillip,Gone to London for four or five days. Research. Brit. Museum …Julian.Somewhat disgruntled, I turned to leave the room and as I did so noticed mybrother’s diary lying open at the foot of his bed where he had thrown it. Thebook itself did not surprise me—before his trouble he had always kept suchnotes—and not being a snoop I would have left the room there and then had I notglimpsed a word—or name—which I recognized on the open, hand-written pages:“Cthulhu.”Simply that … yet it set my mind awhirl with renewed doubts. Was Julian’strouble reasserting itself? Did he yet require psychiatric treatment and werehis original delusions returning? Remembering that Dr. Stewart had warned me ofthe possibility of a relapse, I considered it my duty to read all that mybrother had written—which was where I met with a seemingly insurmountableproblem. The difficulty was simply this: I was unable to read the diary, for itwas written in a completely alien, cryptically cuneiform script the like ofwhich I had ever seen only in those books which Julian had burned. There was adistinct resemblance in those weird characters to the miniscules and dot-groupsof the G’harne Fragments—I remembered being struck by an article on them in oneof Julian’s books, an archaeological magazine—but only a resemblance; the diarycontained nothing I could understand except that one word, Cthulhu, and eventhat had been scored through by Julian, as if on reflection, and a weirdsquiggle of ink had been crammed in above it as a replacement.I was not slow to come to a decision as to what my proper course of actionshould be. That same day, taking the diary with me, I went down to Wharby on thenoon train. That article on the G’harne Fragments which I had remembered readinghad been the work of the curator of the Wharby Museum, Professor Gordon Walmsleyof Goole; who, incidentally, had claimed the first translation of the fragmentsover the claim of the eccentric and long-vanished antiquarian and archaeologistSir Amery Wendy-Smith. The professor was an authority on the Phitmar Stone—thatcontemporary of the famous Rosetta Stone with its key inscriptions in two formsof Egyptian hieroglyphs—and the Geph Columns Characters, and had several othertranslations or feats of antiquarian deciphering to his credit. Indeed, I wasextremely fortunate to find him in at the museum, for he planned to fly withinthe week to Peru where yet another task awaited his abecedarian talents.Nonetheless, busy with arrangements as he was, he was profoundly interested inthe diary; enquiring where the hieroglyphics within had been copied, and by whomand to what purpose? I lied, telling him my brother had copied the inscriptionsfrom a black stone monolith somewhere in the mountains of Hungary; for I knewthat just such a stone exists, having once seen mention of it in one of mybrother’s books. The professor squinted his eyes suspiciously at my lie but wasso interested in the diary’s strange characters that he quickly forgot whateverit was that had prompted his suspicion. From then until I was about to leave hisstudy, located in one of the museum’s rooms, we did not speak. So absorbed didhe become with the diary’s contents that I think he completely forgot mypresence in the room. Before I left, however, I managed to extract a promisefrom him that the diary would be returned to my Glasgow address within threedays and that a copy of his translation, if any, would accompany it. I was gladthat he did not ask me why I required such a translation.My faith in the professor’s abilities was eventually borne out—but not until fartoo late. For Julian returned to Glasgow on the morning of the third day—earlierby twenty-four hours than I had been led to believe, and his diary still had notbeen returned—nor was he slow to discover its loss.I was working half-heartedly at my book when my brother made his appearance. Hemust have been to his own room first. Suddenly I felt a presence in my room withme. I was so lost in my half-formed imaginings and ideas that I had not heard mydoor open; nonetheless I knew something was in there with me. I say something;and that is the way it was! I was being observed—but not, I felt, by a humanbeing! Carefully, with the short hair of my neck prickling with an uncanny lifeof its own, I turned about. Standing in the open doorway with a look on his facewhich I can only describe as being utterly hateful was Julian. But even as I sawhim, his horribly writhing features composed themselves behind those enigmaticdark glasses and he forced an unnatural smile.“I seem to have mislaid my diary, Phillip,” he said slowly. “I’m just in fromLondon and I can’t seem to find the thing anywhere. I don’t suppose you’ve seenit, have you?” There was the suggestion of a sneer in his voice, an unspokenaccusation. “I don’t need the diary really, but there are one or two things init which I wrote in code—ideas I want to use in my story. I’ll let you in on asecret! It’s a fantasy I’m writing! I mean—horror, science fiction, andfantasy—they’re all the rage these days; it’s about time we broke into thefield. You shall see the rough work as soon as it’s ready. But now, seeing ashow you obviously haven’t seen my diary, if you’ll excuse me, I want to get someof my notes together.”He left the room quickly, before I could answer, and I would be lying if I saidI was not glad to see him go. And I could not help but notice that with hisdeparture the feeling of an alien presence also departed. My legs felt suddenlyweak beneath me as a dreadful aura of foreboding settled like a dark cloud overmy room. Nor did that feeling disperse—rather it tightened as night drew on.Lying in my bed that night I found myself going again and again over Julian’sstrangeness, trying to make some sense of it all. A fantasy? Could it be? It wasso unlike Julian; and why, if it was only a story, had his look been so terriblewhen he was unable to find his diary? And why write a story in a diary at all?Oh! He had liked reading weird stuff—altogether too much, as I haveexplained—but he had never before shown any urge to write it! And what of thebooks he had borrowed from the library? They had not seemed to be works he couldpossibly use in connection with the construction of a fantasy! And there wassomething else, something which kept making brief appearances in my mind’s eyebut which I could not quite bring into focus. Then I had it—the thing which hadbeen bothering me ever since I first saw that diary: where in the name of allthat’s holy had Julian learned to write in hieroglyphics?That cinched it!No, I did not believe that Julian was writing a story at all. That was only anexcuse he had created to put me off the track. But what track? What did he thinkhe was doing? Oh! It was obvious; he was on the verge of another breakdown, andthe sooner I got in touch with Dr. Stewart the better. All these tumultuousthoughts kept me awake until a late hour, and if my brother was noisy again thatnight I did not hear him. I was so mentally fatigued that when I eventuallynodded off I slept the sleep of the dead.Is it not strange how the light of day has the power to drive away the worstterrors of night? With the morning my fears were much abated and I decided towait a few more days before contacting Dr. Stewart. Julian spent all morning andafternoon locked in the cellar, and finally—again becoming alarmed as night drewnear—I determined to reason with him, if possible, over supper. During the mealI spoke to him, pointing out how strangely he seemed to be acting and lightlymentioning my fears of a relapse. I was somewhat taken aback by his answers. Heargued it was my own fault he had had to resort to the cellar in which to work,stating that the cellar appeared to be the only place where he could be sure ofany privacy. He laughed at my mention of a relapse, saying he had never feltbetter in his life! When he again mentioned “privacy” I knew he must bereferring to the unfortunate incident of the missing diary and was shamed intosilence. I mentally cursed Professor Walmsley and his whole museum.Yet, in direct opposition to all my brother’s glib explanations, that night wasthe worst; for Julian gibbered and moaned in his sleep, making it impossible forme to get any rest at all; so that when I arose, haggard and withdrawn, late onthe morning of the 13th, I knew I would soon have to take some definite action.I saw Julian only fleetingly that morning, on his way from his room to thecellar, and his face seemed pale and cadaverous. I guessed that his dreams werehaving as bad an effect upon him as they were on me; yet rather than appearingtired or hag-ridden he seemed to be in the grip of some feverish excitement.Now I became more worried than ever and even scribbled two letters to Dr.Stewart, only later to ball them up and throw them away. If Julian was genuinein whatever he was doing, I did not want to spoil his faith in me—what little ofit was left—and if he was not genuine? I was becoming morbidly curious to learnthe outcome of his weird activities. Nonetheless, twice that day, at noon andlater in the evening, when as usual my fears got the better of me, I hammered atthe cellar door demanding to know what was going on in there. My brothercompletely ignored these efforts of mine at communication, but I was determinedto speak to him. When he finally came out of the cellar, much later that night,I was waiting for him at the door. He turned the key in the lock behind him,carefully shielding the cellar’s contents from my view, and regarded mecuriously from behind those horrid dark glasses before offering me the merestparody of a smile.“Phillip, you’ve been very patient with me,” he said, taking my elbow andleading me up the cellar steps, “and I know I must have seemed to be actingquite strangely and inexplicably. It’s all very simple really, but for themoment I can’t explain just what I’m about. You’ll just have to keep faith withme and wait. If you’re worried that I’m heading for another bout of, well,trouble—you can forget it. I’m perfectly all right. I just need a little moretime to finish off what I’m doing—and then, the day after tomorrow, I’ll takeyou in there”—he nodded over his shoulder—“into the cellar, and show you whatI’ve got. All I ask is that you’re patient for just one more day. Believe me,Phillip, you’ve got a revelation coming which will shake you to your very roots;and afterwards—you’ll understand everything. Don’t ask me to explain it allnow—you wouldn’t believe it! But seeing is believing, and when I take you inthere you’ll be able to see for yourself.”He seemed so reasonable, so sensible—if a trifle feverish—and so excited, almostlike a child about to show off some new toy. Wanting to believe him, I allowedmyself to be easily talked around and we went off together to eat a late meal.Julian spent the morning of the 14th transferring all his notes—great sheaves ofthem which I had never suspected existed—together with odds and ends in smallcardboard boxes, from his room to the cellar. After a meager lunch he was off tothe library to “do some final checking” and to return a number of books latelyborrowed. While he was out I went down to the cellar—only to discover that hehad locked the door and taken the key with him. He returned and spent the entireafternoon locked in down there, to emerge later at night looking strangelyelated. Still later, after I had retired to my room, he came and knocked on mydoor.“The night is exceptionally clear, Phillip, and I thought I’d have a look at thesky … the stars have always fascinated me, you know? But the window in my roomdoesn’t really show them off too well; I’d appreciate it if you’d allow me tosit in here and look out for a while?”“By all means do, old fellow, come on in,” I answered, agreeably surprised. Ileft my easy chair and went to stand beside him after he crossed the room tolean on the window-sill. He peered through those strange, dark lenses up and outinto the night. He was, I could see, intently studying the constellations, andas I glanced from the sky to his face I mused aloud: “Looking up there, one isalmost given to believe that the stars have some purpose other than merelymaking the night look pretty.”Abruptly my brother’s manner changed. “What d’you mean by that?” He snapped,staring at me in an obviously suspicious fashion. I was taken aback. My remarkhad been completely innocuous.“I mean that perhaps those old astrologers had something after all,” I answered.“Astrology is an ancient and exact science, Phillip—you shouldn’t talk of it solightly.” He spoke slowly, as though restraining himself from some outburst.Something warned me to keep quiet, so I said no more. Five minutes later heleft. Pondering my brother’s odd manner, I sat there a while longer; and, as Ilooked up at the stars winking through the window across the room, I could nothelp but recall a few of those words he had mumbled in the darkness of mybedroom so long ago at the onset of his breakdown. He had said:“That in time, when the stars are right, they may perform the Great Rising.…”There was no sleep at all for me that night; the noises and mutterings, themouthings and gibberings which came, loud and clear, from Julian’s room wouldnot permit it. In his sleep he talked of such eldritch and inexplicable thingsas the Deep Green Waste, the Scarlet Feaster, the Chained Shoggoth, the Lurkerat the Threshold, Yibb-Tstll, Tsathoggua, the Cosmic Screams, the Lips ofBugg-Shash, and the Inhabitants of the Frozen Chasm. Towards morning, out ofsheer exhaustion, I eventually nodded off into evil dreams which claimed mytroubled subconscious until I awoke shortly before noon on the 15th.Julian was already in the cellar, and as soon as I had washed and dressed,remembering his promise to “show me” what he had got, I started off down there.But at the top of the cellar steps my feet were suddenly arrested by themetallic clack of the letter-box flap in the front door of the house.The diary!Unreasonably fearing that Julian might also have heard the noise, I raced backalong the passage to the door, snatched up the small stamped and addressedbrown-paper parcel which lay on the inside door-mat, and fled with the thing tomy room. I locked myself in and ripped open the parcel. I had tried Julian’sdoor earlier and knew it to be unlocked. Now I planned to go in and drop thediary down behind the headboard of his bed while he was still in the cellar. Inthis way he might be led to believe he had merely misplaced the book. But, afterlaying aside the diary to pick up and read the stapled sheets which had fallenloose and fluttered to the floor, I forgot all about my planned deception in thedawning knowledge of my brother’s obvious impending insanity. Walmsley had doneas he had promised. I cast his brief, eagerly enquiring letter aside andquickly, in growing horror, read his translation of Julian’s cryptical notes. Itwas all there, all the proof I needed, in neat partially annotated paragraphs;but I did not need to read it all. Certain words and phrases, lines andsentences, seemed to leap upon the paper, attracting my frantically searchingeyes:“This shape/form? sickens me. Thanks be there is not long to wait. There isdifficulty in the fact that this form/body/shape? would not obey me at first,and I fear it may have alerted—(?—?) to some degree. Also, I have tohide/protect/conceal? that of me which also came through with thetransfer/journey/passage?“I know the mind of (?—?) fares badly in the Deeps … and of course his eyes wereruined/destroyed? completely.…“Curse the water that quiets/subdues?

I donot like the way this brother—(the word brother implying falseness?) has lookedat me … but he suspects nothing.…”There was more, much more, but I skipped over the vast majority of thetranslation’s remaining contents and finished by reading the last paragraphwhich, presumably, had been written in the diary shortly before Julian tookhimself off to London:“(Date?) … six more (short periods of time?) to wait … Then the stars should beright/in order/positioned? and if all goes well the transfer can beperformed/accomplished?”That was all; but it was more than enough! That reference about my not“suspecting” anything, in connection with those same horrors which had beenresponsible for his first breakdown, was sufficient finally to convince me thatmy brother was seriously ill!Taking the diary with me, I ran out of my room with one thought in my mind.Whatever Julian thought he was doing I had to stop him. Already his delvingsconstituted a terrible threat to his health, and who could say but that the nexttime a cure might not be possible? If he suffered a second attack, there was themonstrous possibility that he would remain permanently insane.Immediately I started my frantic hammering, he opened the cellar door and Iliterally fell inside. I say I fell; indeed, I did—I fell from a sane world intoa lunatic, alien, nightmare dimension totally outside any previous experience.As long as I live I shall never forget what I saw. The floor in the center ofthe cellar had been cleared, and upon it, chalked in bold red strokes, was ahuge and unmistakable evil symbol. I had seen it before in those books whichwere now destroyed … and now I recoiled at what I had later read of it! Beyondthe sign, in one corner, a pile of ashes was all that remained of Julian’s manynotes. An old iron grating had been fixed horizontally over bricks, and themakings of a fire were already upon it. A cryptographic script, which Irecognized as being the blasphemous Nyhargo Code, was scrawled in green and bluechalk across the walls, and the smell of incense hung heavily in the air. Thewhole scene was ghastly, unreal, a living picture from Eliphas Lévi—nothing lessthan the lair of a sorcerer! Horrified, I turned to Julian—in time to see himlift a heavy iron poker and start the stunning swing downwards towards my head.Nor did I lift a finger to stop him. I could not—for he had taken off thosespectacles, and the sight of his terrible face had frozen me rigid as polarice.…Regaining consciousness was like swimming up out of a dead, dark sea. I surfacedthrough shoals of night-black swimmers to an outer world where the ripples ofthe ocean were dimly lit by the glow from a dying orange sun. As the throbbingin my head subsided, those ripples resolved themselves into the pattern of mypin-stripe jacket—but the orange glow remained! My immediate hopes that it hadall been a nightmare were shattered at once; for as I carefully raised my headfrom its position on my chest the whole room slowly came under my unbelievingscrutiny. Thank God Julian had his back to me and I could not see his face. HadI but glimpsed again, in those first moments of recovery, those hellish eyes Iam certain the sight would have returned me to instant oblivion.I could see now that the orange glow was reflected from the now blazing fire onthe horizontal grill, and I saw that the poker which had been used to strike medown was buried in the heart of the flames with red-heat creeping visibly up themetal towards the wooden handle. Glancing at my watch, I saw that I had beenunconscious for many hours—it was fast approaching the midnight hour. That oneglance was also sufficient to tell me that I was tied to the old wicker-chair inwhich I had been seated, for I saw the ropes. I flexed my muscles against mybonds and noticed, not without a measure of satisfaction, that there was acertain degree of slackness in them. I had managed to keep my mind from dwellingon Julian’s facial differences, but, as he turned towards me, I steeled myselfto the coming shock.His face was an impassive white mask in which shone, cold and malevolent andindescribably alien, those eyes! As I live and breathe, I swear they were twicethe size they ought to have been—and they bulged, uniformly scarlet, outwardsfrom their sockets in chill, yet aloof hostility.“Ah! You’ve returned to us, dear brother. But why d’you stare so? Is it that youfind this face so awful? Let me assure you, you don’t find it half so hideous asI!”Monstrous truth, or what I thought was the truth, began to dawn in my mazed andbewildered brain. “The dark spectacles!” I gasped. “No wonder you had to wearthem, even at night. You couldn’t bear the thought of people seeing thosediseased eyes!”“Diseased? No, your reasoning is only partly correct. I had to wear the glasses,yes; it was that or give myself away—which wouldn’t have pleased those who sentme in the slightest, believe me. For Cthulhu, beneath the waves on the far sideof the world, has already made it known to Othuum, my master, of hisdispleasure. They have spoken in dreams and Cthulhu is angry!” He shrugged.“Also, I needed the spectacles; these eyes of mine are accustomed to piercingthe deepest depths of the ocean! Your surface world was an agony to me atfirst—but now I am used to it. In any case, I don’t plan to stay here long, andwhen I go I will take this body with me,” he plucked at himself in contempt,“for my pleasure.”I knew that what he was saying was not, could not, be possible, and I cried outto him, begging him to recognize his own madness. I babbled that modern medicalscience could probably correct whatever was wrong with his eyes. My words weredrowned out by his cold laughter. “Julian!” I cried.“Julian?” he answered. “Julian Haughtree?” He lowered his awful face until itwas only inches from mine. “Are you blind, man? I am Pesh-Tlen, Wizard of deepGell-Ho to the North!” He turned away from me, leaving my tottering mind tototal up a nerve-blasting sum of horrific integers. The Cthulhu Mythos—thosepassages from the Cthaat Aquadingen and the Life of St. Brendan—Julian’s dreams;“They can now control dreams as of old.” The Mind Transfer—“They willrise”—“through his eyes in my body”—giant Gods waiting in the ocean deeps—“Heshall walk the Earth in my guise”—a submarine disturbance off the coast ofGreenland! Deep Gell-Ho to the North …God in heaven! Could such things be? Was this all, in the end, not just somefantastic delusion of Julian’s but an incredible fact? This thing before me! Didhe—it—really see through the eyes of a monster from the bottom of the sea? Andif so—was it governed by that monster’s mind?After that, it was not madness which gripped me—not then—rather was it therefusal of my whole being to accept that which was unacceptable. I do not knowhow long I remained in that state, but the spell was abruptly broken by thefirst, distant chime of the midnight hour.At that distant clamour my mind became crystal clear and the eyes of the beingcalled Pesh-Tlen blazed even more unnaturally as he smiled—if that worddescribes what he did with his face—in final triumph. Seeing that smile, I knewthat something hideous was soon to come and I struggled against my bonds. I wasgratified to feel them slacken a little more about my body. The—creature—hadmeanwhile turned away from me and had taken the poker from the fire. As thechimes of the hour continued to ring out faintly from afar it raised its arms,weaving strange designs in the air with the tip of the redly glowing poker, andcommenced a chant or invocation of such a loathsome association of discordanttones and pipings that my soul seemed to shrink inside me at the hearing. It wasfantastic that what was grunted, snarled, whistled, and hissed with suchincredible fluency could ever have issued from the throat of something I hadcalled brother, regardless what force motivated his vocal cords; but fantasticor not, I heard it. Heard it? Indeed, as that mad cacophony died away, taperingoff to a high-pitched, screeching end—I saw its result!Writhing tendrils of green smoke began to whirl together in one corner of thecellar. I did not see the smoke arrive, nor could I say whence it came—it wasjust suddenly there! The tendrils quickly became a column, rapidly thickening,spinning faster and faster, forming—a shape!Outside in the night freak lightning flashed and thunder rumbled over the cityin what I have since been told was the worst storm in years—but I barely heardthe thunder or the heavy downpour of rain. All my senses were concentrated onthe silently spinning, rapidly coalescing thing in the corner. The cellar had ahigh ceiling, almost eleven feet, but what was forming seemed to fill that spaceeasily.I screamed then, and mercifully fainted. For once again my mind had been busytotaling the facts as I knew them, and I had mentally questioned Pesh-Tlen’sreason for calling up this horror from the depths—or from wherever else it came.Upstairs in my room, unless Julian had been up there and removed it, the answerlay where I had thrown it—Walmsley’s translation! Had not Julian, or Pesh-Tlen,or whatever the thing was, written in that diary: “It will now be necessary tocontact my natural form in order to re-enter it”?My black-out could only have been momentary, for as I regained consciousness forthe second time I saw that the thing in the corner had still not completelyformed. It had stopped spinning and was now centrally opaque, but its outlinewas infirm and wavering, like a scene viewed through smoke. The creature thathad been Julian was standing to one side of the cellar, arms raised towards thesemi-coherent object in the corner, features strained and twitching with hideousexpectancy.“Look,” it spoke coldly, half turning towards me. “See what I and the Deep Oneshave done! Behold, mortal, your brother—Julian Haughtree!”For the rest of my days, which I believe will not number many, I will never beable to rid my memory of that sight! While others lie drowning in sleep I willclaw desperately at the barrier of consciousness, not daring to close my eyesfor fear of that which lingers yet behind my eyelids. As Pesh-Tlen spoke thosewords—the thing in the corner finally materialized!Imagine a black, glistening, ten-foot heap of twisting, ropey tentacles andgaping mouths.… Imagine the outlines of a slimy, alien face in which, sunk deepin gaping sockets, are the remains of ruptured, human eyes.… Imagine shriekingin absolute clutching, leaping fear and horror—and imagine the thing which Ihave here described answering your screams in a madly familiar voice; a voicewhich you instantly recognize!“Phillip! Phillip, where are you? What’s happened? I can’t see.… We came up outof the sea, and then I was whirled away somewhere and I heard your voice.” Thehorror rocked back and forth. “Don’t let them take me back, Phillip!”The voice was that of my brother, all right—but not the old, sane Julian I hadknown! That was when I, too, went mad; but it was a madness with a purpose, ifnothing else. When I had previously fainted, the sudden loosening of my bodymust have completed the work which I had started on the ropes. As I lurched tomy feet they fell from me to the floor. The huge, blind monstrosity in thecorner had started to lumber in my direction, vaguely twisting its tentaclesbefore it as it came. At the same time the red-eyed demon in Julian’s form wasedging carefully towards it, arms eagerly outstretched.“Julian,” I screamed, “look out—only by contact can he re-enter—and then heintends to kill you, to take you back with him to the deeps.”“Back to the deeps? No! No, he can’t! I won’t go!” The lumbering horror with mybrother’s mad voice spun blindly around, its flailing tentacles knocking thehybrid sorcerer flying across the floor. I snatched the poker from the firewhere it had been replaced and turned threateningly upon the sprawlinghalf-human.“Stand still, Julian!” I gibbered over my shoulder at the horror from the sea asthe wizard before me leapt to his feet. The lumberer behind me halted. “You,Pesh-Tlen, get back.” There was no plan in my bubbling mind; I only knew I hadto keep the two—things—apart. I danced like a boxer, using the glowing poker toward off the suddenly frantic Pesh-Tlen.“But it’s time—it’s time! The contact must be now!” The red-eyed thingscreeched. “Get out of my way.…” Its tones were barely human now. “You can’tstop me.… I must … must … must make strong … strong contact! I must … bhfg—ngyyfhtlhlh hegm—yeh’hhg narcchhh’yy! You won’t cheat me!”A pool of slime, like the trail of a great snail, had quickly spread from thegiant shape behind me; and, even as he screamed, Pesh-Tlen suddenly leaptforward straight onto it, his feet skidding on the evil-smelling mess. Hecompletely lost his balance. Arms flailing he fell, face down, sickeningly, ontothe rigid red-hot poker in my hand. Four inches of the glowing metal slid, likea warm knife through butter, into one of those awful eyes. There was a hissingsound, almost drowned out by the creature’s single shrill scream of agony, and asmall cloud of steam rose mephitically from the thing’s face as it pitched tothe floor.Instantly the glistening black giant behind me let out a shriek of terror. Ispun round, letting the steaming poker fall, to witness that monstrosity fromthe ocean floor rocking to and fro, tentacles wrapped protectively round itshead. After a few seconds it became still, and the rubbery arms fell listlesslyaway to reveal the multimouthed face with its ruined, rotting eyes.“You’ve killed him, I know it,” Julian’s voice said, calmer now. “He is finishedand I am finished—already I can feel them recalling me.” Then, voice risinghysterically: “They won’t take me alive!”The monstrous form trembled and its outline began to blur. My legs crumpledbeneath me in sudden reaction, and I pitched to the floor. Perhaps I passed outagain—I don’t know for sure—but when I next looked in its direction the horrorhad gone. All that remained was the slime and the grotesque corpse.I do not know where my muscles found the strength to carry my tottering andmazed body out of that house. Sanity did not drive me, I admit that, for I wasquite insane. I wanted to stand beneath the stabbing lightning and scream atthose awful, rain-blurred stars. I wanted to bound, to float in my madnessthrough eldritch depths of unhallowed black blood. I wanted to cling to thewrithing breasts of Yibb-Tstll. Insane—insane, I tell you, I gibbered andmoaned, staggering through the thunder-crazed streets until, with a roar and acrash, sanity-invoking lightning smashed me down.…You know the rest. I awoke to this world of white sheets; to you, the policepsychiatrist, with your soft voice.… Why must you insist that I keep telling mystory? Do you honestly think to make me change it? It’s true, I tell you! Iadmit to killing my brother’s body—but it wasn’t his mind that I burned out! Youstand there babbling of awful eye diseases. Julian had no eye disease! D’youreally imagine that the other eye, the unburnt one which you found in thatbody—in my brother’s face—was his? And what of the pool of slime in the cellarand the stink? Are you stupid or something? You’ve asked for a statement, andhere it is! Watch, damn you, watch while I scribble it down … you damn greatcrimson eye … always watching me … who would have thought that the lips ofBugg-Shash could suck like that? Watch, you redness you … and look out for theScarlet Feaster! No, don’t take the paper away.…NOTE:Sir,Dr. Stewart was contacted as you suggested, and after seeing Haughtree he gavehis expert opinion that the man was madder than his brother had ever been. Healso pointed out the possibility that the disease of Julian Haughtree’s eyes hadstarted soon after his partial mental recovery—probably brought on by constantlywearing dark spectacles. After Dr. Stewart left the police ward, Haughtreebecame very indignant and wrote the above statement.Davies, our specialist, examined the body in the cellar himself and is convincedthat the younger brother must, indeed, have been suffering from a particularlyhorrible and unknown ocular disease.It is appreciated that there are one or two remarkable coincidences in the wildfancies of both brothers in relation to certain recent factual events—but theseare, surely, only coincidences. One such event is the rise of the volcanicisland of Surtsey. Haughtree must somehow have heard of Surtsey after beingtaken under observation. He asked to be allowed to read the following newspaperaccount, afterwards yelling very loudly and repeatedly: “By God! They’ve namedit after the wrong mythos!” Thereafter he was put into a straitjacket of thearm-restricting type:——BIRTH OF AN ISLAND——Yesterday morning, the 16th November, the sun rose on a long, narrow island oftephra, lying in the sea to the north of Scotland at latitude 63°18′ North andlongitude 20°36½′ West. Surtsey, which was born on the 15th November, was then130 feet high and growing all the time. The fantastic “birth” of the island waswitnessed by the crew of the fishing vessel Isleifer II, which was lying west ofGeirfuglasker, southernmost of the Vestmann Islands. Considerable disturbance ofthe sea—which hindered clear observation—was noticed, and the phenomena, theresult of submarine volcanic activity, involved such awe-inspiring sights ascolumns of smoke reaching to two and a half miles high, fantastic lightningstorms, and the hurling of lava-bombs over a wide area of the ocean. Surtsey hasbeen named after the giant Surter, who—in Norse Mythology—“Came from the Southwith Fire to fight the God Freyr at Ragnarok,” which battle preceded the end ofthe world and the Twilight of the Gods. More details and pictures inside.Still in the “jacket,” Haughtree finally calmed himself and begged that furtherinteresting items in the paper be read to him. Dr. Davies did the reading, andwhen he reached the following report Haughtree grew very excited:——BEACHES FOULED——Garvin Bay, on the extreme North coast, was found this morning to be horriblyfouled. For a quarter of a mile deposits of some slimy, black grease were leftby the tide along the sands. The stench was so great from these unrecognizabledeposits that fishermen were unable to put to sea. Scientific analysis hasalready shown the stuff to be of an organic base, and it is thought to be sometype of oil. Local shipping experts are bewildered, as no known tankers havebeen in the area for over three months. The tremendous variety of dead androtting fish also washed up has caused the people of nearby Belloch to takestrong sanitary precautions. It is hoped that tonight’s tide will clear theaffected area.…At the end of the reading Haughtree said: “Julian said they wouldn’t take himalive.” Then, still encased in the jacket, he somehow got off the bed and flunghimself through the third-story window of his room in the police ward. His rushat the window was of such tremendous ferocity and strength that he took the barsand frame with him. It all happened so quickly there was nothing anyone could doto stop him.Submitted as an appendix to my original report.Sgt. J. T.

Then he coaxed his bookout of the polythene bag on the seat beside him, withdrew the bus-ticket frombetween the pages, held it against the cover to protect the latter from hisfingers, and began to read. As often happened the conductor assumed that theticket authorized Strutt’s present journey; Strutt did not enlighten him.Outside, the snow whirled down the side streets and slipped beneath the wheelsof cautious cars.The slush splashed into his boots as he stepped down outside Brichester Centraland, snuggling the bag beneath his coat for extra safety, pushed his way towardthe bookstall, treading on the settling snowflakes. The glass panels of thestall were not quite closed; snow had filtered through and dulled the glossypaperbacks. “Look at that!” Strutt complained to a young man who stood next tohim and anxiously surveyed the crowd, drawing his neck down inside his collarlike a tortoise. “Isn’t that disgusting? These people just don’t care!” Theyoung man, still searching the wet faces, agreed abstractedly. Strutt strode tothe other counter of the stall, where the assistant was handing out newspapers.“I say!” called Strutt. The assistant, sorting change for a customer, gesturedhim to wait. Over the paperbacks, through the steaming glass, Strutt watched theyoung man rush forward and embrace a girl, then gently dry her face with ahandkerchief. Strutt glanced at the newspaper held by the man awaiting change.BRUTAL MURDER IN RUINED CHURCH, he read; the previous night a body had beenfound inside the roofless walls of a church in Lower Brichester, when the snowhad been cleared from this marble image, frightful mutilations had been revealedcovering the corpse, oval mutilations which resembled— The man took the paperand his change away into the station. The assistant turned to Strutt with asmile: “Sorry to keep you waiting.” “Yes,” said Strutt. “Do you realize thosebooks are getting snowed on? People may want to buy them, you know.” “Do you?”the assistant replied. Strutt tightened his lips and turned back into thesnow-filled gusts. Behind him he heard the ring of glass pane meeting pane.GOOD BOOKS ON THE HIGHWAY provided shelter; he closed out the lashing sleet andstood taking stock. On the shelves the current titles showed their faces whilethe others turned their backs. Girls were giggling over comic Christmas cards;an unshaven man was swept in on a flake-edged blast and halted, staring arounduneasily. Strutt clucked his tongue; tramps shouldn’t be allowed in bookshops tosoil the books. Glancing sideways to observe whether the man would bend back thecovers or break the spines, Strutt moved among the shelves, but could not findwhat he sought. Chatting with the cashier, however, was an assistant who hadpraised Last Exit to Brooklyn to him when he had bought it last week, and hadlistened patiently to a list of Strutt’s recent reading, though he had notseemed to recognize the titles. Strutt approached him and enquired: “Hello—anymore exciting books this week?”The man faced him, puzzled. “Any more—?”“You know, books like this?” Strutt held up his polythene bag to show the greyUltimate Press cover of The Caning-Master by Hector Q.“Ah, no. I don’t think we have.” He tapped his lip. “Except—Jean Genet?”“Who? Oh, you mean Jennet. No, thanks, he’s dull as ditchwater.”“Well, I’m sorry, sir, I’m afraid I can’t help you.”“Oh.” Strutt felt rebuffed. The man seemed not to recognize him, or perhaps hewas pretending. Strutt had met his kind before and had them mutely patronize hisreading. He scanned the shelves again, but no cover caught his eye. At the doorhe furtively unbuttoned his shirt to protect his book still further, and a handfell on his arm. Lined with grime, the hand slid down to his and touched hisbag. Strutt shook it off angrily and confronted the tramp.“Wait a minute!” the man hissed. “Are you after more books like that? I knowwhere we can get some.”This approach offended Strutt’s self-righteous sense of reading books which hadno right to be suppressed. He snatched the bag out of the fingers closing on it.“So you like them too, do you?”“Oh, yes, I’ve got lots.”Strutt sprang his trap. “Such as?”“Oh, Adam and Evan, Take Me How You Like, all the Harrison adventures, you know,there’s lots.”Strutt grudgingly admitted that the man’s offer seemed genuine. The assistant atthe cash-desk was eyeing them; Strutt stared back. “All right,” he said.“Where’s this place you’re talking about?”The other took his arm and pulled him eagerly into the slanting snow. Clutchingshut their collars, pedestrians were slipping between the cars as they waitedfor a skidded bus ahead to be removed; flakes were crushed into the corners ofthe windscreens by the wipers. The man dragged Strutt amid the horns whichbrayed and honked, then between two store windows from which girls watchedsmugly as they dressed headless figures, and down an alley. Strutt recognizedthe area as one which he vainly combed for back-street bookshops; disappointingalcoves of men’s magazines, occasional hot pungent breaths from kitchens, carsfitted with caps of snow, loud pubs warm against the weather. Strutt’s guidedodged into the doorway of a public bar to shake his coat; the white glazecracked and fell from him. Strutt joined the man and adjusted the book in itsbag, snuggled beneath his shirt. He stamped the crust loose from his boots,stopping when the other followed suit; he did not wish to be connected with theman even by such a trivial action. He looked with distaste at his companion, athis swollen nose through which he was now snorting back snot, at the stubbleshifting on the cheeks as they inflated and the man blew on his trembling hands.Strutt had a horror of touching anyone who was not fastidious. Beyond thedoorway flakes were already obscuring their footprints, and the man said: “I getterrible thirsty walking fast like this.”“So that’s the game, is it?” But the bookshop lay ahead. Strutt led the way intothe bar and bought two pints from a colossal barmaid, her bosom bristling withruffles, who billowed back and forth with glasses and worked the pumps withgusto. Old men sucked at pipes in vague alcoves, a radio blared marches, menclutching tankards aimed with jovial inaccuracy at dart-board or spittoon.Strutt flapped his overcoat and hung it next to him; the other retained his andstared into his beer. Determined not to talk, Strutt surveyed the murky mirrorswhich reflected gesticulating parties around littered tables not directlyvisible. But he was gradually surprised by the taciturnity of his table-mate;surely these people (he thought) were remarkably loquacious, in fact virtuallyimpossible to silence? This was intolerable; sitting idly in an airlessback-street bar when he could be on the move or reading—something must be done.He gulped down his beer and thumped the glass upon its mat. The other started.Then, visibly abashed, he began to sip, seeming oddly nervous. At last it wasobvious that he was dawdling over the froth, and he set down his glass andstared at it. “It looks as if it’s time to go,” said Strutt.The man looked up; fear widened his eyes. “Christ, I’m wet,” he muttered. “I’lltake you again when the snow goes off.”“That’s the game, is it?” Strutt shouted. In the mirrors, eyes sought him. “Youdon’t get that drink out of me for nothing! I haven’t come this far—!”The man swung round and back, trapped. “All right, all right, only maybe I won’tfind it in this weather.”Strutt found this remark too inane to comment. He rose, and buttoning his coatstrode into the arcs of snow, glaring behind to ensure he was followed.The last few shop-fronts, behind them pyramids of tins marked with misspeltplacards, were cast out by lines of furtively curtained windows set inunrelieved vistas of red brick; behind the panes Christmas decorations hung likewreaths. Across the road, framed in a bedroom window, a middle-aged woman drewthe curtains and hid the teenage boy at her shoulder. “Hel-lo, there they go,”Strutt did not say; he felt he could control the figure ahead without speakingto him, and indeed had no desire to speak to the man as he halted trembling, nodoubt from the cold, and hurried onward as Strutt, an inch taller than his fiveand a half feet and better built, loomed behind him. For an instant, as a bodyof snow drove toward him down the street, flakes over-exposing the landscape andcutting his cheeks like transitory razors of ice, Strutt yearned to speak, totell of nights when he lay awake in his room, hearing the landlady’s daughterbeing beaten by her father in the attic bedroom above, straining to catchmuffled sounds through the creak of bedsprings, perhaps from the couple below.But the moment passed, swept away by the snow; the end of the street had opened,split by a traffic-island into two roads thickly draped with snow, one curlingaway to hide between the houses, the other short, attached to a roundabout. NowStrutt knew where he was. From a bus earlier in the week he had noticed the KEEPLEFT sign lying helpless on its back on the traffic-island, its face kicked in.They crossed the roundabout, negotiated the crumbling lips of ruts full ofdeceptively glazed pools collecting behind the bulldozer treads of aredevelopment scheme, and onward through the whirling white to a patch of wasteground where a lone fireplace drank the snow. Strutt’s guide scuttled into analley and Strutt followed, intent on keeping close to the other as he knockedpowdered snow from dustbin lids and flinched from back-yard doors at which dogsclawed and snarled. The man dodged left, then right, between the closelabyrinthine walls, among houses whose cruel edges of jagged window-panes andthrusting askew doors even the snow, kinder to buildings than to theiroccupants, could not soften. A last turning, and the man slithered onto apavement beside the remnants of a store, its front gaping emptily to framewine-bottles abandoned beneath a HEIN 57 VARIET poster. A dollop of snow fellfrom the awning’s skeleton to be swallowed by the drift below. The man shook,but as Strutt confronted him, pointed fearfully to the opposite pavement:“That’s it, I’ve brought you here.”The tracks of slush splashed up Strutt’s trouser legs as he ran across, checkingmentally that while the man had tried to disorient him he had deduced which mainroad lay some five hundred yards away, then read the inscription over the shop:AMERICAN BOOKS BOUGHT AND SOLD. He touched a railing which protected an opaquewindow below street level, wet rust gritting beneath his nails, and surveyed thedisplay in the window facing him: History of the Rod—a book he had foundmonotonous—thrusting out it shoulders among science-fiction novels by Aldiss,Tubb, and Harrison, which hid shamefacedly behind lurid covers; Le Sadisme auCinéma; Robbe-Grillet’s Voyeur looking lost; The Naked Lunch— nothing worth hisjourney there, Strutt thought. “All right, it’s about time we went in,” he urgedthe man inside, and with a glance up the eroded red brick at the first-floorwindow, the back of a dressing-table mirror shoved against it to replace onepane, entered also. The other had halted again, and for an unpleasant secondStrutt’s fingers brushed the man’s musty overcoat. “Come on, where’s the books?”he demanded, shoving past into the shop.The yellow daylight was made murkier by the window display and the pin-upmagazines hanging on the inside of the glass-panelled door; dust hung lazily inthe stray beams. Strutt stopped to read the covers of paperbacks stuffed intocardboard boxes on one table, but the boxes contained only Westerns, fantasies,and American erotica, selling at half price. Grimacing at the books whichstretched wide their corners like flowering petals, Strutt bypassed thehardcovers and squinted behind the counter, slightly preoccupied; as he hadclosed the door beneath its tongueless bell, he had imagined he had heard a crysomewhere near, quickly cut off. No doubt round here you hear that sort of thingall the time, he thought, and turned on the other: “Well, I don’t see what Icame for. Doesn’t anybody work in this place?”Wide-eyed, the man gazed past Strutt’s shoulder; Strutt looked back and saw thefrosted-glass panel of a door, one corner of the glass repaired with cardboard,black against a dim yellow light which filtered through the panel. Thebookseller’s office, presumably—had he heard Strutt’s remark? Strutt confrontedthe door, ready to face impertinence. Then the man pushed by him, searchingdistractedly behind the counter, fumbling open a glass-fronted bookcase full ofvolumes in brown paper jackets and finally extracting a parcel in grey paperfrom its hiding-place in one corner of a shelf. He thrust it at Strutt,muttering, “This is one, this is one,” and watched, the skin beneath his eyestwitching, as Strutt tore off the paper.The Secret Life of Wackford Squeers— “Ah, that’s fine,” Strutt approved,forgetting himself momentarily, and reached for his wallet; but greasy fingersclawed at his wrist. “Pay next time,” the man pleaded. Strutt hesitated; couldhe get away with the book without paying? At that moment, a shadow rippledacross the frosted glass: a headless man dragging something heavy. Decapitatedby the frosted glass and by his hunched position, Strutt decided, then realizedthat the shopkeeper must be in contact with Ultimate Press; he must notprejudice this contact by stealing a book. He knocked away the frantic fingersand counted out two pounds; but the other backed away, stretching out hisfingers in stark fear, and crouched against the office door from whose pane thesilhouette had disappeared, before flinching almost into Strutt’s arms. Struttpushed him back and laid the notes in the space left on the shelf by WackfordSqueers, then turned on him: “Don’t you intend to wrap it up? No, on secondthoughts I’ll do it myself.”The roller on the counter rumbled forth a streamer of brown paper; Strutt soughtan undiscolored stretch. As he parcelled the book, disentangling his feet fromthe rejected coil, something crashed to the floor. The other had retreatedtoward the street door until one dangling cuff-button had hooked the corner of acarton full of paperbacks; he froze above the scattered books, mouth and handsgaping wide, one foot atop an open novel like a broken moth, and around himmotes floated into beams of light mottled by the sifting snow. Somewhere a lockclicked. Strutt breathed hard, taped the package, and circling the man indistaste, opened the door. The cold attacked his legs. He began to mount thesteps and the other flurried in pursuit. The man’s foot was on the doorstep whena heavy tread approached across the boards. The man spun about, and below Struttthe door slammed. Strutt waited; then it occurred to him that he could hurry andshake off his guide. He reached the street and a powdered breeze pecked at hischeeks, cleaning away the stale dust of the shop. He turned away his face and,kicking the rind of snow from the headline of a sodden newspaper, made for themain road which he knew to pass close by.Strutt woke shivering. The neon sign outside the window of his flat, a clichebut relentless as a toothache, was garishly defined against the night every fiveseconds, and by this and the shafts of cold Strutt knew that it was earlymorning. He closed his eyes again, but though his lids were hot and heavy hismind would not be lulled. Beyond the limits of his memory lurked the dream whichhad awoken him; he moved uneasily. For some reason he thought of a passage fromthe previous evening’s reading: “As Adam reached the door he felt Evan’s handgrip his, twisting his arm behind his back, forcing him to the floor—” His eyesopened and sought the bookcase as if for reassurance; yes, there was the book,secure within its covers, carefully aligned with its fellows. He recalledreturning home one evening to find Miss Whippe, Old-Style Governess, thrustinside Prefects and Fags, straddled by Prefects and Fags; the landlady hadexplained that she must have replaced them wrongly after dusting, but Struttknew that she had damaged them vindictively. He had bought a case that locked,and when she asked him for the key had replied: “Thanks, I think I can do themjustice.” You couldn’t make friends nowadays. He closed his eyes again; the roomand bookcase, created in five seconds by the neon and destroyed with equalregularity, filled him with their emptiness, reminding him that weeks lay aheadbefore the beginning of next term, when he would confront the first class of themorning and add “You know me by now” to his usual introduction “You play fairwith me and I’ll play fair with you,” a warning which some boy would be sure totest, and Strutt would have him; he saw the expanse of white gymshort seatstretched tight down on which he would bring a gym-shoe with satisfyingforce—Strutt relaxed; soothed by an overwhelming echo of the pounding feet onthe wooden gymnasium floor, the fevered shaking of the wall-bars as the boysswarmed ceilingward and he stared up from below, he slept.Panting, he drove himself through his morning exercises, then tossed off thefruit juice which was always his first call on the tray brought up by thelandlady’s daughter. Viciously he banged the glass back on the tray; the glasssplintered (he’d say it was an accident; he paid enough rent to cover, he mightas well get a little satisfaction for his money). “Bet you have a fabChristmas,” the girl had said, surveying the room. He’d made to grab her roundthe waist and curb her pert femininity—but she’d already gone, her skirt’spleats whirling, leaving his stomach hotly knotted in anticipation.Later he trudged to the supermarket. From several front gardens came theteeth-grinding scrape of spades clearing snow; these faded and were answered bythe crushed squeak of snow engulfing boots. When he emerged from the supermarketclutching an armful of cans, a snowball whipped by his face to thud against thewindow, a translucent beard spreading down the pane like the fluid from thenoses of those boys who felt Strutt’s wrath most often, for he was determined tobeat this ugliness, this revoltingness, out of them. Strutt glared about him forthe marksman—a seven-year-old, boarding his tricycle for a quick retreat; Struttmoved involuntarily as if to pull the boy across his knee. But the street wasnot deserted; even now the child’s mother, in slacks and curlers peeking frombeneath a headscarf, was slapping her son’s hand: “I’ve told you, don’t do that.—Sorry,” she called to Strutt. “Yes, I’m sure,” he snarled, and tramped back tohis flat. His heart pumped uncontrollably. He wished fervently that he couldtalk to someone as he had talked to the bookseller on the edge of Goatswood whohad shared his urges; when the man had died earlier that year Strutt had feltabandoned in a tacitly conspiring, hostile world. Perhaps the new shop’s ownermight prove similarly sympathetic? Strutt hoped that the man who had conductedhim there yesterday would not be in attendance, but if he was, surely he couldbe got rid of—a bookseller dealing with Ultimate Press must be a man afterStrutt’s own heart, who would be as opposed as he to that other’s presence whilethey were talking frankly. As well as this discussion, Strutt needed books toread over Christmas, and Squeers would not last him long; the shop wouldscarcely be closed on Christmas Eve. Thus reassured, he unloaded the cans on thekitchen table and ran downstairs.Strutt stepped from the bus in silence; the engine’s throb was quickly muffledamong the laden houses. The piled snow waited for some sound. He splashedthrough the tracks of cars to the pavement, its dull coat depressed by countlessoverlapping footprints. The road twisted slyly; as soon as the main road was outof sight the side street revealed its real character. The snow laid over thehouse-fronts became threadbare; rusty protrusions poked through. One or twowindows showed Christmas trees, their ageing needles falling out, their branchestipped with luridly sputtering lights. Strutt, however, had no eye for this butkept his gaze on the pavement, seeking to avoid stains circled by dogs’pawmarks. Once he met the gaze of an old woman staring down at a point below herwindow which was perhaps the extent of her outside world. Momentarily chilled,he hurried on, pursued by a woman who, on the evidence within her pram, hadgiven birth to a litter of newspapers, and halted before the shop.Though the orange sky could scarcely have illuminated the interior, no electricgleam was visible through the magazines, and the torn notice hanging behind thegrime might read CLOSED. Slowly Strutt descended the steps. The pram squealedby, the latest flakes spreading across the newspapers. Strutt stared at itsinquisitive proprietor, turned and almost fell into sudden darkness. The doorhad opened and a figure blocked the doorway.“You’re not shut, surely?” Strutt’s tongue tangled.“Perhaps not. Can I help you?”“I was here yesterday. Ultimate Press book,” Strutt replied to the face levelwith his own and uncomfortably close.“Of course you were, yes, I recall.” The other swayed incessantly like anathlete limbering up, and his voice wavered constantly from bass to falsetto,dismaying Strutt. “Well, come in before the snow gets to you,” the other saidand slammed the door behind them, evoking a note from the ghost of the bell’stongue.The bookseller—this was he, Strutt presumed—loomed behind him, a head taller;down in the half-light, among the vague vindictive corners of the tables, Struttfelt an obscure compulsion to assert himself somehow, and remarked: “I hope youfound the money for the book. Your man didn’t seem to want me to pay. Somepeople would have taken him at his word.”“He’s not with us today.” The bookseller switched on the light inside hisoffice. As his lined pouched face was lit up it seemed to grow; the eyes weresunk in sagging stars of wrinkles; the cheeks and forehead bulged from furrows;the head floated like a half-inflated balloon above the stuffed tweed suit.Beneath the unshaded bulb the walls pressed close, surrounding a battered deskfrom which overflowed fingerprinted copies of The Bookseller thrust aside by ablack typewriter clogged with dirt, beside which lay a stub of sealing-wax andan open box of matches. Two chairs faced each other across the desk, and behindit was a closed door. Strutt seated himself before the desk, brushing dust tothe floor. The bookseller paced round him and suddenly, as if struck by thequestion, demanded: “Tell me, why d’you read these books?”This was a question often aimed at Strutt by the English master in the staffroomuntil he had ceased to read his novels in the breaks. Its sudden reappearancecaught him off guard, and he could only call on his old riposte: “How d’youmean, why? Why not?”“I wasn’t being critical,” the other hurried on, moving restlessly around thedesk. “I’m genuinely interested. I was going to make the point that don’t youwant what you read about to happen, in a sense?”“Well, maybe.” Strutt was suspicious of the trend of this discussion, and wishedthat he could dominate; his words seemed to plunge into the snow-cloaked silenceinside the dusty walls to vanish immediately, leaving no impression.“I mean this: when you read a book don’t you make it happen before you, in yourmind? Particularly if you consciously attempt to visualize, but that’s notessential. You might cast the book away from you, of course. I knew a booksellerwho worked on this theory; you don’t get much time to be yourself in this sortof area, but when he could he worked on it, though he never quite formulated—Wait a minute, I’ll show you something.”He leapt away from the desk and into the shop. Strutt wondered what was beyondthe door behind the desk. He half-rose but, peering back, saw the bookselleralready returning through the drifting shadows with a volume extracted fromamong the Lovecrafts and Derleths.“This ties in with your Ultimate Press books, really,” the other said, bangingthe office door to as he entered. “They’re publishing a book by JohannesHenricus Pott next year, so we hear, and that’s concerned with forbidden lore aswell, like this one; you’ll no doubt be amazed to hear that they think they mayhave to leave some of Pott in the original Latin. This here should interest you,though; the only copy. You probably won’t know the Revelations of Glaaki; it’s asort of Bible written under supernatural guidance. There were only elevenvolumes—but this is the twelfth, written by a man at the top of Mercy Hillguided through his dreams.” His voice grew unsteadier as he continued. “I don’tknow how it got out; I suppose the man’s family may have found it in some atticafter his death and thought it worth a few coppers, who knows? Mybookseller—well, he knew of the Revelations, and he realized this was priceless;but he didn’t want the seller to realize he had a find and perhaps take it tothe library or the University, so he took it off his hands as part of a job lotand said he might use it for scribbling. When he read it— Well, there was onepassage that for testing his theory looked like a godsend. Look.”The bookseller circled Strutt again and placed the book in his lap, his armsresting on Strutt’s shoulders. Strutt compressed his lips and glanced up at theother’s face; but some strength weakened, refusing to support his disapproval,and he opened the book. It was an old ledger, its hinges cracking, its yellowedpages covered by irregular lines of scrawny handwriting. Throughout theintroductory monologue Strutt had been baffled; now the book was before him, itvaguely recalled those bundles of duplicated typewritten sheets which had beenpassed around the toilets in his adolescence. “Revelations” suggested theforbidden. Thus intrigued, he read at random. Up here in Lower Brichester thebare bulb defined each scrap of flaking paint on the door opposite, and handsmoved on his shoulders, but somewhere down below he would be pursued throughdarkness by vast soft footsteps; when he turned to look, a swollen glowingfigure was upon him— What was all this about? A hand gripped his left shoulderand the right hand turned pages; finally one finger underlined a phrase:Beyond a gulf in the subterranean night a passage leads to a wall of massivebricks, and beyond the wall rises Y’golonac to be served by the tattered eyelessfigures of the dark. Long has he slept beyond the wall, and those which crawlover the bricks scuttle across his body never knowing it to be Y’golonac; butwhen his name is spoken or read he comes forth to be worshipped or to feed andtake on the shape and soul of those he feeds upon. For those who read of eviland search for its form within their minds call forth evil, and so may Y’golonacreturn to walk among men and await that time when the earth is cleared off andCthulhu rises from his tomb among the weeds, Glaaki thrusts open the crystaltrapdoor, the brood of Eihort are born into daylight, Shub-Niggurath stridesforth to smash the moon-lens, Byatis bursts forth from his prison, Daoloth tearsaway illusion to expose the reality concealed behind.The hands on his shoulders shifted constantly, slackening and tightening. Thevoice fluctuated: “What did you think of that?”Strutt thought it was rubbish, but somewhere his courage had slipped; he repliedunevenly: “Well, it’s—not the sort of thing you see on sale.”“You found it interesting?” The voice was deepening; now it was an overwhelmingbass. The other swung round behind the desk; he seemed taller—his head struckthe bulb, setting shadows peering from the corners and withdrawing, and peeringagain. “You’re interested?” His expression was intense, as far as it could bemade out; for the light moved darkness in the hollows of his face, as if thebone structure were melting visibly.In the murk in Strutt’s mind appeared a suspicion; had he not heard from hisdear dead friend the Goatswood bookseller that a black magic cult existed inBrichester, a circle of young men dominated by somebody Franklin or Franklyn?Was he being interviewed for this? “I wouldn’t say that,” he countered.“Listen. There was a bookseller who read this, and I told him you may be thehigh priest of Y’golonac. You will call down the shapes of night to worship himat the times of year; you will prostrate yourself before him and in return youwill survive when the earth is cleared off for the Great Old Ones; you will gobeyond the rim to what stirs out of the light …”Before he could consider Strutt blurted: “Are you talking about me?” He hadrealized he was alone in a room with a madman.“No, no, I meant the bookseller. But the offer now is for you.”“Well, I’m sorry, I’ve got other things to do.” Strutt prepared to stand up.“He refused also.” The timbre of the voice grated in Strutt’s ears. “I had tokill him.”Strutt froze. How did one treat the insane? Pacify them. “Now, now, hold on aminute.…”“How can it benefit you to doubt? I have more proof at my disposal than youcould bear. You will be my high priest, or you will never leave this room.”For the first time in his life, as the shadows between the harsh oppressivewalls moved slower as if anticipating, Strutt battled to control an emotion; hesubdued his mingled fear and ire with calm. “If you don’t mind, I’ve got to meetsomebody.”“Not when your fulfillment lies here between these walls.” The voice wasthickening. “You know I killed the bookseller—it was in your papers. He fledinto the ruined church, but I caught him with my hands.… Then I left the book inthe shop to be read, but the only one who picked it up by mistake was the manwho brought you here.… Fool! He went mad and cowered in the corner when he sawthe mouths! I kept him because I thought he might bring some of his friends whowallow in physical taboos and lose the true experiences, those places forbiddento the spirit. But he only contacted you and brought you here while I wasfeeding. There is food occasionally; young boys who come here for books insecret; they make sure nobody knows what they read!—and can be persuaded to lookat the Revelations. Imbecile! He can no longer betray me with his fumbling—but Iknew you would return. Now you will be mine.”Strutt’s teeth ground together silently until he thought his jaws would break;he stood up, nodding, and handed the volume of the Revelations toward thefigure; he was poised, and when the hand closed on the ledger he would dart forthe office door.“You can’t get out, you know; it’s locked.” The bookseller rocked on his feet,but did not start toward him; the shadows now were mercilessly clear and dusthung in the silence. “You’re not afraid—you look too calculating. Is it possiblethat you still do not believe? All right—” he laid his hands on the doorknobbehind the desk: “—do you want to see what is left of my food?”A door opened in Strutt’s mind, and he recoiled from what might lie beyond. “No!No!” he shrieked. Fury followed his involuntary display of fear; he wished hehad a cane to subjugate the figure taunting him. Judging by the face, hethought, the bulges filling the tweed suit must be of fat; if they shouldstruggle, Strutt would win. “Let’s get this clear,” he shouted, “we’ve playedgames long enough! You’ll let me out of here or I—” but he found himself glaringabout for a weapon. Suddenly he thought of the book still in his hand. Hesnatched the matchbox from the desk, behind which the figure watched, ominouslyimpassive. Strutt struck a match, then pinched the boards between finger andthumb and shook out the pages. “I’ll burn this book!” he threatened.The figure tensed, and Strutt went cold with fear of his next move. He touchedthe flame to paper, and the pages curled and were consumed so swiftly thatStrutt had only the impression of bright fire and shadows growing unsteadilymassive on the walls before he was shaking ashes to the floor. For a moment theyfaced each other, immobile. After the flames a darkness had rushed into Strutt’seyes. Through it he saw the tweed tear loudly as the figure expanded.Strutt threw himself against the office door, which resisted. He drew back hisfist, and watched with an odd timeless detachment as it shattered the frostedglass; the act seemed to isolate him, as if suspending all action outsidehimself. Through the knives of glass, on which gleamed drops of blood, he sawthe snowflakes settle through the amber light, infinitely far; too far to callfor help. A horror filled him of being overpowered from behind. From the back ofthe office came a sound; Strutt spun and as he did so closed his eyes, terrifiedto face the source of such a sound—but when he opened them he saw why the shadowon the frosted pane yesterday had been headless, and he screamed. As the deskwas thrust aside by the towering naked figure, on whose surface still hung ragsof the tweed suit, Strutt’s last thought was an unbelieving conviction that thiswas happening because he had read the Revelations; somewhere, someone had wantedthis to happen to him. It wasn’t playing fair, he hadn’t done anything todeserve this—but before he could scream out his protest his breath was cut off,as the hands descended on his face and the wet red mouths opened in their palms.* Originally published in Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos, 1969."},{"pageContent":"THE RETURN OF THE LLOIGOR*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]COLIN WILSON[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]My name is Paul Dunbar Lang, and in three weeks’ time I shall be seventy-twoyears old. My health is excellent, but since one can never know how many moreyears lie ahead, I shall set down this story on paper, and perhaps even publishit, if the fit takes me. In my youth, I was a confirmed believer in the Baconianauthorship of Shakespeare’s plays, but I took care never to mention my views inprint, out of fear of my academic colleagues. But age has one advantage; itteaches one that the opinions of other people are not really very important;death is so much more real. So if I publish this, it will not be out of desireto convince anyone of its truth; but only because I don’t care whether it isbelieved or not.Although I was born in England—in Bristol—I have lived in America since I wastwelve years old. And for nearly forty years, I have taught English literatureat the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. My Life of Chatterton is stillthe standard work on its subject, and for the past fifteen years I have been theeditor of Poe Studies.Two years ago in Moscow, I had the pleasure of meeting the Russian writer IrakliAndronikov, who is known mainly for his “literary research stories,” a genre hemay be said to have created. It was Andronikov who asked me if I had ever met W.Romaine Newbold, whose name is involved with the Voynich manuscript. Not onlyhad I never met Professor Newbold, who died in 1926, but I had never heard ofthe manuscript. Andronikov outlined the story. I was fascinated. When I returnedto the States, I hastened to read Newbold’s The Cipher of Roger Bacon(Philadelphia, 1928), and Professor Manly’s two articles on the subject.The story of the Voynich manuscript is briefly this. It was found in an oldchest in an Italian castle by a rare book dealer, Wilfred M. Voynich, andbrought to the United States in 1912. With the manuscript, Voynich also found aletter that asserted that it had been the property of two famous scholars of theseventeenth century, and that it had been written by Roger Bacon, the Franciscanmonk who died about 1294. The manuscript was 116 pages long, and was apparentlywritten in cipher. It was clearly some kind of scientific or magical document,since it contained drawings of roots or plants. On the other hand, it alsocontained sketches that looked amazingly like illustrations from some modernbiological textbook of minute cells and organisms—for example, of spermatozoons.There were also astronomical diagrams.For nine years, professors, historians, and cryptographers tried to break thecode. Then, in 1921, Newbold announced to the American Philosophical Society inPhiladelphia that he had been able to decipher certain passages. The excitementwas immense; it was regarded as a supreme feat of American scholarship. But theexcitement increased when Newbold disclosed the contents of the manuscript. Forit seemed that Bacon must have been many centuries ahead of his time. He hadapparently invented the microscope some four hundred years before Leeuwenhoek,and had shown a scientific acumen that surpassed even that of his namesakeFrancis Bacon in the sixteenth century.Newbold died before completing his work, but his “discoveries” were published byhis friend Roland Kent. It was at this point that Professor Manly took up thestudy of the manuscript, and decided that Newbold’s enthusiasm had led him todeceive himself. Examined under a microscope, it was seen that the strangenature of the characters was not entirely due to a cipher. The ink had peeledoff the vellum as it dried, so that the “shorthand” was actually due to ordinarywear and tear over many centuries. With Manly’s announcement of his discovery in1931, interest in the “most mysterious manuscript in the world” (Manly’s phrase)vanished, Bacon’s reputation sank, and the whole thing was quickly forgotten.Upon my return from Russia, I visited the University of Pennsylvania, andexamined the manuscript. It was an odd sensation. I was not disposed to view itromantically. In my younger days, I had often felt my hair stirring as I handleda letter in Poe’s handwriting, and I had spent many hours sitting in his room atthe University of Virginia, trying to commune with his spirit. As I got older, Ibecame more matter-of-fact—a recognition that geniuses are basically like othermen—and I stopped imagining that inanimate objects are somehow trying to “tell astory.”Yet as soon as I handled the Voynich manuscript, I had a nasty sensation. Icannot describe it more precisely than that. It was not a sense of evil orhorror or dread—just nastiness; like the sensation I used to have as a childpassing the house of a woman who was reputed to have eaten her sister. It mademe think of murder. This sensation stayed with me during the two hours while Iexamined the manuscript, like an unpleasant smell. The librarian obviously didnot share my feeling. When I handed the manuscript back to her, I said jokingly:“I don’t like that thing.” She merely looked puzzled; I could tell she had noidea of what I meant.Two weeks later, the two photostat copies I had ordered arrived inCharlottesville. I sent one to Andronikov, as I had promised, and had the otherone bound for the university library. I spent some time poring over it with amagnifying glass, reading Newbold’s book and Manly’s articles. The sensation of“nastiness” did not return. But when, some months later, I took my nephew tolook at the manuscript, I again experienced the same feeling. My nephew feltnothing.While we were in the library, an acquaintance of mine introduced me to AverelMerriman, the young photographer whose work is used extensively in expensive artbooks of the kind published by Thames and Hudson. Merriman told me that he hadrecently photographed a page of the Voynich manuscript in colour. I asked if Imight see it. Later that afternoon, I called on him in his hotel room and sawthe photograph. What was my motive? I believe it was a sort of morbid desire tofind out if the “nastiness” would come over in a colour photo. It didn’t. Butsomething more interesting did. It so happened that I was thoroughly familiarwith the page Merriman had photographed. And so now, looking at it carefully, Ifelt sure that it was, in some subtle way, different from the original. I staredat it for a long time before I realised why. The colouring of thephotograph—developed by a process invented by Merriman—was slightly “richer”than that of the original manuscript. And when I looked at certain symbolsindirectly—concentrating on the line just above them—they appeared to be somehow“completed,” as if the discoloration left by the flakes of ink had becomevisible.I tried not to show my excitement. For some reason, I felt intensely secretive,as if Merrimen had just handed me the clue to hidden treasure. A kind of “Mr.Hyde” sensation came over me—a feeling of cunning, and a kind of lust. I askedhim casually how much it would cost to photograph the whole manuscript in thisway. He told me several hundred dollars. Then my idea came to me. I asked if,for a much larger sum—say a thousand dollars—he would be willing to make melarge “blow-ups” of the pages—perhaps four to a page. He said he would, and Iwrote him a cheque on the spot. I was tempted to ask him to send me thephotographs one by one, as he did them, then felt that this might arouse hiscuriosity. To my nephew Julian, I explained as we left that the library of theUniversity of Virginia had asked me to have the photographs made—a pointless liethat puzzled me. Why should I lie? Had the manuscript some dubious influence ofwhich I had become a victim?A month later, the registered parcel arrived. I locked the door of my study, andsat in the armchair by the window as I tore off the wrappings. I took a randomphotograph from the middle of the pile, and held it out to the light. I wantedto shout with pleasure at what I saw. Many of the symbols seemed to be“completed,” as if their broken halves were joined by a slightly darkened areaof the vellum. I looked at sheet after sheet. It was impossible to doubt. Thecolour photography somehow showed up markings that were invisible even to amicroscope.What followed now was routine work, although it took many months. Thephotographs were taped, one after the other, to a large drawing board, and thentraced. The tracings were transferred, with the utmost care, to heavy drawingpaper. Then, working with deliberate slowness, I sketched in the “invisible”part of the symbols, completing them. When the whole thing was finished, I boundit into a large folio, and then settled down to study it. I had completed morethan half the symbols—which were, of course, four times their natural size. Now,with the aid of a kind of painstaking detective work, I was able to completenearly all the others.Only then, after ten months’ work, did I allow myself to consider the main partof my task—the question of deciphering.To begin with, I was totally in the dark. The symbols were complete—but whatwere they? I showed some of them to a colleague who had written a book on thedeciphering of ancient languages. He said they bore some resemblance to laterEgyptian hieroglyphics—of the period when all resemblance to “pictures” hadvanished. I wasted a month pursuing this false trail. But fate was on my side.My nephew was about to return to England, and he asked me to let him have aphotograph of a few pages of the Voynich manuscript. I experienced a deepreluctance, but could hardly refuse. I was still being thoroughly secretiveabout my work, rationalising this by telling myself that I merely wanted toinsure that no one stole my ideas. Finally, I decided that perhaps the best wayof preventing Julian from feeling curiosity about my labours was to make aslittle fuss as possible. So two days before he was due to sail, I presented himwith a photograph of a page of the manuscript, and with my reconstructed versionof yet another page. I did this casually, as if it were a matter that hardlyinterested me.Ten days later, I received a letter from Julian that made me congratulate myselfon my decision. On the boat, he had made friends with a young member of the ArabCultural Association, who was travelling to London to take up a post. Oneevening, by chance, he showed him the photographs. The actual page of theVoynich manuscript meant nothing to the Arab; but when he saw my“reconstruction,” he said immediately: “Ah, this is some form of Arabic.” Notmodern Arabic; and he was unable to read it. But he had no doubt that themanuscript had originated in the Middle East.I rushed to the university library and found an Arabic text. A glance at itshowed me the Arab had been right. The mystery of the Voynich script was solved:it seemed to be mediaeval Arabic.It took me two weeks to learn to read Arabic—although, of course, I could notunderstand it. I prepared to settle down to a study of the language. If I workedat it for six hours a day, I calculated that I should be able to speak itfluently in about four months. However, this labour proved to be unnecessary.For once I had mastered the script well enough to translate a few sentences intoEnglish letters, I realised that it was not written in Arabic, but in a mixtureof Latin and Greek.My first thought was that someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to hidehis thoughts from prying eyes. Then I realised that this was an unnecessaryassumption. The Arabs were, of course, among the most skilled doctors in Europein the Middle Ages. If an Arab physician were to write a manuscript, what wouldbe more likely than that he should do so in Latin and Greek, using Arab script?I was now so excited that I could barely eat or sleep. My housekeeper told mecontinually that I needed a holiday. I decided to take her advice, and take asea voyage. I would go back to Bristol to see my family, and take the manuscriptwith me on the boat, where I could work undisturbed all day long.Two days before the ship sailed, I discovered the title of the manuscript. Itstitle page was missing, but there was a reference on the fourteenth page thatwas clearly to the work itself. It was called Necronomicon.The following day, I was seated in the lounge of the Algonquin Hotel in NewYork, sipping a martini before dinner, when I heard a familiar voice. It was myold friend Foster Damon, of Brown University, in Providence. We had met yearsbefore when he was collecting folk songs in Virginia, and my admiration for hispoetry, as well as for his works on Blake, had kept us in fairly close contactever since. I was delighted to meet him in New York. He was also staying at theAlgonquin. Naturally, we had dinner together. Halfway through the meal, he askedme what I was working on.“Have you ever heard of the Necronomicon?” I asked him, smiling.“Of course.”I goggled at him. “You have? Where?”“In Lovecraft. Isn’t that what you meant?”“Who on earth is Lovecraft?”“Don’t you know? One of our local writers in Providence. He died about thirtyyears ago. Haven’t you come across his name?”Now a memory stirred somewhere in my head. When I had been investigating Mrs.Whitman’s house in Providence—for my book The Shadow of Poe—Foster had mentionedLovecraft, with some such comment as: “You ought to read Lovecraft. He’s thebest American writer of horror stories since Poe.” I can remember saying that Ithought Bierce deserved that title, and then forgetting about it.“Do you mean that this word Necronomicon actually occurs in Lovecraft?”“I’m pretty sure of it.”“And where do you suppose Lovecraft got it?”“I always assumed he invented it.”My interest in food vanished. This was the kind of development that no one couldhave foreseen. For, as far as I knew, I was the first person to read the Voynichmanuscript. Or was I? How about the two scholars of the seventeenth century? Hadone of them deciphered it and mentioned its name in his writings?Obviously, the first thing to do was to check Lovecraft, and find out whetherFoster’s memory had served him correctly. I found myself praying that he wasmistaken. After the meal, we took a taxi to a bookshop in Greenwich Village, andthere I was able to locate a paperback of Lovecraft stories. Before we left theshop Foster riffed through its pages, then placed his finger on one of them:“There it is. ‘Necronomicon, by the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred.’ ”There it was, impossible to doubt. In the taxi, on the way home, I tried not toshow how shattered I felt. But soon after we got back, I excused myself and wentto my room. I tried to read Lovecraft, but could not concentrate.The next day, before sailing, I searched Brentano’s for Lovecraft books, andmanaged to find two in hard covers, as well as several paperbacks. The hardcoverbooks were The Shuttered Room and Supernatural Horror in Literature. In thefirst of these, I found a lengthy account of the Necronomicon, together withseveral quotations. But the account states, “While the book itself and most ofits translators, and its author, are all imaginary, Lovecraft hereemployed … his technique of inserting actual historical fact in the middle oflarge areas of purely imaginary lore.”Purely imaginary … Could it perhaps be a mere matter of coincidence of names?Necronomicon—the book of dead names. Not a difficult title to invent. The more Ithought of it, the more likely it seemed that this was the correct explanation.And so before I went on board that afternoon, I was already feeling a great dealeasier in my mind. I ate a good dinner, and read myself to sleep afterwards withLovecraft.I am not sure how many days went by before I began to experience a graduallyincreasing fascination with this new literary discovery. I know that my firstimpression was simply that Lovecraft was a skilful constructor of weird stories.Perhaps it was my work on the translation of the Voynich manuscript that alteredmy approach to him. Or possibly it was simply the realisation that Lovecraft hadbeen uniquely obsessed by this strange world of his own creation—uniquely evenwhen compared with such writers as Gogol and Poe. He made me think of certainwriters on anthropology, however lacking in literary skill, yet made impressiveby the sheer authenticity of their material.With several hours a day in which to work, I quickly completed my translation ofthe Voynich manuscript. Long before the end, I had become aware that it was afragment, and that there were mysteries involved that went beyond the cipher—acode within a code, as it were. But what struck me most powerfully—so that Isometimes had the utmost difficulty in restraining myself from rushing into thecorridor and talking to the first person I met—was the incredible scientificknowledge revealed by the manuscript. Newbold had not been entirely wrong aboutthis. The author simply knew far more than any thirteenth-century monk—orMohammedan scholar, for that matter—could possibly know. A long and obscurepassage about a “god” or demon who is somehow a vortex filled with stars isfollowed by a passage in which the primal constituent of matter is described asenergy (using the Greek dynamis and energeia, as well as the Latin vis) inlimited units. This sounds like a clear anticipation of the quantum theory.Again, the seed of man is described as being made up of units of power, each ofwhich endows man with a lifelong characteristic. This certainly soundsremarkably like a reference to the genes. The drawing of a human spermatozoonoccurs in the midst of a text that refers to the Sefer Yezirah, the Book ofCreation in the Kabbala. Several slighting references to the Ars Magna ofRaymond Lull support the notion that the author of the work was Roger Bacon—acontemporary of the mathematical mystic, although in one place in the text herefers to himself under the name of Martinus Hortulanus, which might betranslated Martin Gardener.What, in the last analysis, is the Voynich manuscript? It is a fragment of awork that professes to be a complete scientific account of the universe: itsorigin, history, geography (if I may use the term), mathematical structure, andhidden depths. The pages I possessed contained a preliminary digest of thismaterial. In parts, it was terrifyingly knowledgeable; in other places, itseemed to be a typical mediaeval melange of magic, theology, and pre-Copernicanspeculation. I got the impression that the work may have had several authors, orthat the part I possessed was a digest of some other book that was imperfectlyunderstood by Martin the Gardener. There are the usual references to HermesTrismegistus and the Emerald Tablet, to Cleopatra’s book on gold making, theChrysopeia, to the gnostic serpent Ouroboros, and to a mysterious planet or starcalled Tormantius, which was spoken of as the home of awe-inspiring deities.There were also many references to a “Khian language” which, from their context,obviously have no connection with the Aegean island of Chios, Homer’sbirthplace.It was this that set me upon the next stage of my discovery. In Lovecraft’sSupernatural Horror in Literature, in the short section on Arthur Machen, I cameacross a reference to the “Chian language,” connected in some way with awitchcraft cult. It also mentioned “Dôls,” “voolas,” and certain “Aklo letters.”The latter caught my attention; there had been a reference in the Voynichmanuscript to the “Aklo inscriptions.” I had at first supposed Aklo to be somekind of corruption of the Kabbalastic “Agla,” a word used in exorcism; now Irevised my opinion. To appeal to coincidence beyond a certain point is a sign offeeble-mindedness. The hypothesis that now presented itself to my mind was this:that the Voynich manuscript was a fragment or a summary of a much longer workcalled the Necronomicon, perhaps of Kabbalistic origin. Complete copies of thebook exist, or have existed, and word-of-mouth tradition may have been keptalive by secret societies such as Naundorff’s infamous Church of Carmel, or theBrotherhood of Tlön described by Borges. Machen, who spent some time in Paris inthe 1880s, almost certainly came into contact with Naundorff’s disciple, theAbbé Boullan, who is known to have practised black magic. (He appears inHuysman’s Là-Bas.) This could explain the traces of the Necronomicon to be foundin his work. As to Lovecraft—he may have come across it or the verbal traditionsconcerning it, on his own, or perhaps even through Machen.In that case, there might be copies of the work hidden away in some garret, orperhaps in another chest in an Italian castle. What a triumph if I could locateit, and publish it together with my translation of the Voynich manuscript! Oreven if I could definitely prove that it had existed.This was the daydream that preoccupied me during my five days on the Atlantic.And I read and reread my translation of the manuscript, hoping to discover someclue that might lead me to the complete work. But the more I read, the lessclear it became. On a first reading, I had sensed an over-all pattern, some darkmythology, never stated openly, but deducible from hints. As I reread the work,I began to wonder whether all this had not been my imagination. The book seemedto dissolve into unrelated fragments.In London, I spent a futile week in the British Museum, searching for referencesto the Necronomicon in various magical works, from Basil Valentine’s Azoth toAleister Crowley. The only promising reference was a footnote in E. A.Hitchcock’s Remarks upon Alchemy (1865) to “the now unattainable secrets of theAklo tablets.” But the book contained no other reference to these tablets. Didthe word “unattainable” mean that the tablets were known to be destroyed? If so,how did Hitchcock come to know about it?The gloom of a London October, and the exhaustion that came from a persistentsore throat, had almost persuaded me to take a plane back to New York, when myluck changed. In a bookshop in Maidstone I met Fr. Anthony Carter, a Carmelitemonk and editor of a small literary magazine. He had met Machen in 1944—threeyears before the writer’s death, and had later devoted an issue of his magazineto Machen’s life and work. I accompanied Fr. Carter back to the Priory nearSevenoaks, and as he drove the baby Austin at a sedate thirty miles an hour, hetalked to me at length about Machen. Finally, I asked him whether, to hisknowledge, Machen had ever had contact with secret societies or black magic.“Oh, I doubt it,” he said, and my heart sank. Another false trail …“I suspect hepicked up various odd traditions near his birthplace, Melincourt. It used to bethe Roman Isca Silurum.”“Traditions?” I tried to keep my voice casual. “What sort of traditions?”“Oh, you know. The sort of thing he describes in The Hill of Dreams. Pagan cultsand that sort of thing.”“I thought that was pure imagination.”“Oh, no. He once hinted to me that he’d seen a book that revealed all kinds ofhorrible things about the area of Wales.”“Where? What kind of a book?”“I’ve no idea. I didn’t pay too much attention. I believe he saw it in Paris—orit might have been Lyons. But I remember the name of the man who showed it tohim. Staislav de Guaita.”“Guaita!” I couldn’t keep my voice down, and he almost steered us off the road.He looked at me with mild reproach.“That’s right. He was involved in some absurd black-magic society. Machenpretended to take it all seriously, but I’m sure he was pulling my leg.…”Guaita was involved in the black-magic circle of Boullan and Naundorff. It wasone more brick in the edifice.“Where is Melincourt?”“In Monmouthshire, I believe. Somewhere near Southport. Are you thinking ofgoing?”My train of thought must have been obvious. I saw no point in denying it.The priest said nothing until the car stopped in the tree-shaded yard behind thePriory. Then he glanced at me and said mildly: “I wouldn’t get too involved if Iwere you.”I made a noncommittal noise in my throat, and we dropped the subject. But a fewhours later, back in my hotel room, I remembered his comment and was struck byit. If he believed that Machen had been pulling his leg about his “pagan cults,”why warn me not to get too involved? Did he really believe in them, but preferto keep this to himself? As a Catholic, of course, he was bound to believe inthe existence of supernatural evil.…I had checked in the hotel’s Bradshaw before going to bed. There was a train toNewport from Paddington at 9:55, with a change for Caerleon at 2:30. At fiveminutes past ten, I was seated in the dining car, drinking coffee, watching thedull, soot-coloured houses of Ealing give way to the green fields of Middlesex,and feeling a depth and purity of excitement that was quite new to me. I cannotexplain this. I can only say that, at this point in my search, I had a clearintuition that the important things were beginning. Until now, I had beenslightly depressed, in spite of the challenges of the Voynich manuscript.Perhaps this was due to a faint distaste for the subject matter of themanuscript. I am as romantic as the next man—and I think most people arehealthily romantic at bottom—but I suppose all this talk of black magic struckme ultimately as degrading nonsense—degrading to the human intellect and itscapacity for evolution. But on this grey October morning, I felt somethingelse—the stirring of the hair that Watson used to experience when Holmes shookhim awake with “The game’s afoot, Watson.” I still had not the remotest ideawhat the game might consist of. But I was beginning to experience an oddintuition of its seriousness.When I grew tired of looking at the scenery, I opened the book bag and took outa Guide to Wales, and two volumes of Arthur Machen; some selected stories, andthe autobiographical Far Off Things. This latter led me to expect to find a landof enchantment in Machen’s part of Wales. He writes: “I shall always esteem itas the greatest piece of fortune that has fallen to me, that I was born in theheart of Gwent.” His descriptions of the “mystic tumulus,” the “giant roundedbillow” of the Mountain of Stone, the deep woods and the winding river, made itsound like the landscape of a dream. And in fact, Melincourt is the legendaryseat of King Arthur, and Tennyson sets his Idylls of the King there.The Guide to Wales, which I had picked up at a secondhand bookshop in theCharing Cross Road, described Southport as a little country market town “amid apleasant, undulating, and luxuriant landscape of wood and meadow.” I had half anhour to spare between trains, and decided to look at the town. Ten minutes wasenough. Whatever may have been its charms in 1900 (the date of the Guide), it isnow a typical industrial town with cranes on the skyline and the hooting oftrains and boats. I drank a double whisky in the hotel next to the station, tofortify myself in the event of a similar disappointment in Caerleon. And eventhis did little to relieve the impact of the dreary, modernised little town inwhich I found myself an hour later, after a short journey through the suburbs ofSouthport. The town is dominated by an immense red brick monstrosity, which Iguessed correctly to be a mental institution. And Chesterton’s “Usk of mightymurmurings” struck me as a muddy stream whose appearance was not improved by therain that now fell from the slate grey sky.I checked into my hotel—an unpretentious place, without central heating—at halfpast three, looked at the flowered wallpaper in my bedroom—at least one survivalfrom 1900—and decided to walk out in the rain.A hundred yards along the main street, I passed a garage with a hand-printednotice CARS FOR HIRE. A short, bespectacled man was leaning over the engine of acar. I asked him whether there was a driver available.“Oh yes, sir.”“This afternoon?”“If you like, sir. Where did you want to go?”“Just to look at the countryside.”He looked incredulous. “You are a tourist, are you, sir?”“I suppose so, in a way.”“I’ll be right with you.”His air as he wiped his hands suggested that he thought this was too good tomiss. Five minutes later, he was waiting in front of the building, wearing aleather motoring jacket of a 1920ish vintage, and driving a car of the sameperiod. The headlights actually vibrated up and down to the chatter of itsengine.“Where to?”“Anywhere. Somewhere towards the north—towards Monmouth.”I sat huddled in the back, watching the rain, and feeling distinct signs of acold coming on. But after ten minutes, the car warmed up, and the sceneryimproved. In spite of modernisation and the October drizzle, the Usk valleyremained extremely beautiful. The green of the fields was striking, evencompared to Virginia. The woods were, as Machen said, mysterious and shadowy,and the scenery looked almost too picturesque to be genuine, like one of thosegrandiose romantic landscapes by Asher Durand. And to the north and northeastlay the mountains, hardly visible through the smokey clouds; the desolatelandscape of “The White People” and “The Novel of the Black Seal”—both veryfresh in my mind. Mr. Evans, my driver, had the tact not to speak, but to allowme to soak up the feeling of the landscape.I asked my driver whether he had ever seen Machen, but I had to spell the namebefore Mr. Evans ever recognised it. As far as I could tell, Machen seemedcompletely forgotten in his native town.“You studyin’ him, are you, sir?”He used the word “studying” as if it were some remote and ritualistic activity.I acknowledged that I was; in fact, I exaggerated slightly and said that Ithought of writing a book on Machen. This aroused his interest; whatever mighthave been his attitude to dead writers, he had nothing but respect for livingones. I told him that several of Machen’s stories were set in these desolatehills that lay ahead of us, and I added casually:“What I really want to find out is where he picked up the legends he used in hisstories. I’m fairly sure he didn’t invent them. Do you know of anyone aroundhere who might know about them—the vicar, for example?”“Oh, no. The vicar wouldn’t know anythin’ about legends.” He made it sound as iflegends were a thoroughly pagan activity.“Can you think of anyone who might?”“Let’s see. There’s the Colonel, if you could get on the right side of him. He’sa funny chap, is the Colonel. If he don’t like you, you’d be wastin’ yourbreath.”I tried to find out more about this Colonel—whether he was an antiquary,perhaps; but Evans’s statements remained Celtically vague. I changed the subjectto the scenery, and got a steady stream of information that lasted all the wayback to Melincourt. At Mr. Evans’s suggestion, we drove as far north as Raglan,then turned west and drove back with the Black Mountains on our right, lookingbleaker and more menacing at close quarters than from the green lowlands aroundMelincourt. In Pontypool, I stopped and bought a book about the Roman remains atMelincourt, and a secondhand copy of Giraldus Cambrensis, the Welsh historianand geographer, a contemporary of Roger Bacon.Mr. Evans’s taxi rates proved to be surprisingly reasonable, and I agreed tohire him for a whole day as soon as the weather improved. Then, back in thehotel, with a potation called grog, consisting of brown rum, hot water, lemonjuice, and sugar, I read the London newspapers, and made cautious enquiriesabout the Colonel. This line of approach proving barren—the Welsh are notforthcoming with strangers—I looked him up in the phone book. Colonel LionelUrquart, The Leasowes, Melincourt. Then, fortified by my grog, I went into theicy phone kiosk and dialled his number. A woman’s voice with an almostincomprehensible Welsh accent said the Colonel was not at home, then said hemight be, and she would go and look.After a long wait, a harsh British upper-class voice barked into the phone:“Hello, who is it?” I identified myself, but before I could finish, he snapped:“I’m sorry, I never give interviews.” I explained quickly that I was a professorof literature, not a journalist.“Ah, literature. What kind of literature?”“At the moment, I’m interested in the local legends. Someone mentioned that youknew a great deal about them.”“Ah, they did, eh? Well, I suppose I do. What did you say your name was?”I repeated it, and mentioned the University of Virginia, and my majorpublications. There were odd mumbling noises at the other end of the line, as ifhe were eating his moustache and finding it hard to swallow. Finally, he said:“Look here … supposing you come over here a bit later this evening, around nine?We can have a drink and talk.”I thanked him, and went back to the lounge, where there was a good fire, andordered another rum. I felt I deserved congratulations, after Mr. Evans’swarnings about the Colonel. Only one thing worried me. I still had no idea ofwho he was, or what kind of legends interested him. I could only guess that hewas the local antiquaryAt half past eight, after an ample but unimaginative supper of lamb chops,boiled potatoes, and some unidentifiable green vegetable, I set out for theColonel’s house, having enquired the way from the desk clerk, who was obviouslyintrigued. It was still raining and windy, but my cold was held at bay by thegrog.The Colonel’s house was outside the town, halfway up a steep hill. There was arusty iron gate, and a driveway full of pools of muddy water. When I rang thedoorbell, ten dogs began to bark at once, and one approached the door on theother side and snarled discouragingly. A plump Welsh woman opened the door,slapped the Doberman pinscher that growled and slavered, and led me past a packof yelping dogs—several, I noticed, with scars and torn ears—into a dimly litlibrary smelling of coal smoke. I’m not sure what sort of a man I expected tomeet—probably tall and British, with a sunburned face and bristly moustache—buthe proved rather a surprise. Short and twisted—a riding accident had broken hisright hip—his dark complexion suggested mixed blood, while the receding chingave him a slightly reptilian look. On first acquaintance, a definitelyrepellant character. His eyes were bright and intelligent, but mistrustful. Hestruck me as a man who could generate considerable resentment. He shook my handand asked me to sit down. I sat near the fire. A cloud of smoke immediatelybillowed out, making me choke and gasp.“Needs sweeping,” said my host. “Try that chair.” A few moments later, somethingfell down the chimney along with a quantity of soot, and before the flames madeit unrecognisable, I thought I recognised the skeleton of a bat. Isurmised—correctly, as it turned out—that Colonel Urquart had few visitors, andtherefore few occasions to use the library.“Which of my books have you come across?” he asked me.“I … er … to be quite honest, I only know them by hearsay.”I was relieved when he said dryly: “Like most people. Still, it’s encouraging toknow you’re interested.”At this point, looking past his head, I noticed his name on the spine of a book.It seemed a rather luridly designed dust jacket, and the title, The Mysteries ofMu, was quite clearly visible in scarlet letters. So I added quickly:“Of course, I don’t know a great deal about Mu. I remember reading a book bySpence.…”“Total charlatan!” Urquart snapped, and I thought his eyes took on a reddishtinge in the firelight.“And then,” I added, “Robert Graves has some curious theories about Wales andthe Welsh.…”“Lost tribes of Israel, indeed! I’ve never heard such an infantile andfar-fetched idea! Anyone could tell you it’s nonsense. And besides, I’ve provedconclusively that the Welsh are survivors from the lost continent of Mu. I haveevidence to prove it. No doubt you’ve come across some of it.”“Not as much as I could have wished,” I said, wondering what I’d let myself infor.At this point he interrupted himself to offer me a whisky, and I had to make aquick decision—whether to plead another appointment and escape, or to stick itout. The sound of rain on the windows decided me. I would stick it out.As he poured the whisky, he said, “I think I can guess what you are thinking.Why Mu rather than Atlantis?”“Why, indeed,” I said, in a bemused way. I wasn’t even aware, at that stage,that Mu was supposed to have been situated in the Pacific.“Quite. I asked myself exactly that question twenty years ago, when I first mademy discoveries. Why Mu, when the major relics lie in South Wales andProvidence?”“Providence? Which Providence?”“Rhode Island. I have proof that it was the centre of the religion of thesurvivors from Mu.“Relics. This, for example.” He handed me a chunk of green stone, almost tooheavy to hold in one hand. I had never seen such stone before, although I know alittle about geology. Neither had I seen anything like the drawing andinscription cut into it, except once in a temple in the jungles of Brazil. Theinscription was in curved characters, not unlike Pitman’s shorthand; the face inthe midst of them could have been a devil mask, or a snake god, or a seamonster. As I stared at it, I felt the same distaste—the sense of nastiness—thatI had experienced on first seeing the Voynich manuscript. I took a large swallowof my whisky. Urquart indicated the “sea monster.”“The symbol of the people of Mu. The Yambi. This stone is their colour. It’s oneof the ways to learn where they’ve been—water of that colour.”I looked at him blankly. “In what way?”“When they destroy a place, they like to leave behind pools of water—smalllakes, if possible. You can always tell them because they look slightlydifferent from an ordinary pool of water. You get this combination of the greenof stagnation, and that bluey-grey you can see here.”He turned to the bookshelf and took down an expensive art book with a title likeThe Pleasures of Ruins. He opened it and pointed at a photograph. It was incolour.“Look at this—Sidon in Lebanon. The same green water. And look at this:Anuradhapura in Ceylon—the same green and blue. Colours of decay and death. Bothplaces they destroyed at some point. There are six more that I know of.”I was fascinated and impressed in spite of myself; perhaps it was the stone thatdid it.“But how did they do that?”“You make the usual mistake—of thinking of them as being like ourselves. Theyweren’t. In human terms, they were formless and invisible.”“Invisible?”“Like wind or electricity. You have to understand they were forces rather thanbeings. They weren’t even clear separate identities, as we are. That’s stated inChurchward’s Naacal tablets.”He proceeded to talk, and I shall not attempt to set down all he said. A lot ofit struck me as sheer nonsense. But there was a crazy logic in much of it. Hewould snatch up books off his shelves and read me passages—most of these, as faras I could see, by all kinds of cranks. But he would then take up a textbook ofanthropology or paleontology, and read some extract that seemed to confirm whathe had just said.What he told me, in brief, was this. The continent of Mu existed in the SouthPacific between twenty thousand and twelve thousand years ago. It consisted oftwo races, one of which resembled present-day man. The other consisted ofUrquart’s “invisible ones from the stars.” These latter, he said, weredefinitely aliens on our earth, and the chief among them was called Ghatanothoa,the dark one. They sometimes took forms, such as the monster on the tablet—whowas a representation of Ghatanothoa—but existed as “vortices” of power in theirnatural state. They were not benevolent, in our sense, for their instincts anddesires were completely unlike ours. A tradition of the Naacal tablets has itthat these beings created man, but this, Urquart said, must be incorrect, sincearchaeological evidence proved that man had evolved over millions of years.However, the men on Mu were certainly their slaves, and were apparently treatedwith what we would consider unbelievable barbarity. The Lloigor, or star-beings,could amputate limbs without causing death, and did this at the least sign ofrebelliousness. They could also cause cancer-like tentacles to grow on theirhuman slaves, and also used this as a form of punishment. One picture in theNaacal tablets shows a man with tentacles growing from both eye sockets.But Urquart’s theory about Mu had an extremely original touch. He told me thatthere was one major difference between the Lloigor and human beings. The Lloigorwere deeply and wholly pessimistic. Urquart pointed out that we could hardlyimagine what this meant. Human beings live on hopes of various kinds. We know wehave to die. We have no idea where we came from, or where we are going to. Weknow that we are subject to accident and illness. We know that we seldom achievewhat we want; and if we achieve it, we have ceased to appreciate it. All this weknow, and yet we remain incurably optimistic, even deceiving ourselves withabsurd, patently nonsensical, beliefs about life after death.“Why am I talking to you,” said Urquart, “although I know perfectly well that noprofessor has an open mind, and every one I’ve had any dealings with hasbetrayed me? Because I think that you might be the exception—you might grasp thetruth of what I’m saying. But why should I want it known, when I have to dielike everyone else? Absurd, isn’t it? Yet we’re not reasonable creatures. Welive and act on an unreasonable reflex of optimism—a mere reflex, like your kneekicking when someone taps it. It’s obviously completely stupid. Yet we live byit.”I found myself impressed by him, in spite of my conviction that he was slightlymad. He was certainly intelligent.He went on to explain that the Lloigor, although infinitely more powerful thanmen, were also aware that optimism would be absurd in this universe. Their mindswere a unity, not compartmentalised, like ours. There was no distinction in thembetween conscious, subconscious, and superconscious mind. So they saw thingsclearly all the time, without the possibility of averting the mind from thetruth, or forgetting. Mentally speaking, the closest equivalent to them would beone of those suicidal romantics of the nineteenth century, steeped in gloom,convinced that life is a pit of misery, and accepting this as a basis foreveryday life. Urquart denied that the Buddhists resemble the Lloigor in theirultimate pessimism—not merely because of the concept of Nirvana, which offers akind of absolute, equivalent to the Christian God, but because no Buddhistreally lives in the constant contemplation of his pessimism. He accepts itintellectually, but does not feel it with his nerves and bones. The Lloigorlived their pessimism.Unfortunately—and here I found it hard to follow Urquart—the earth is notsuitable for such pessimism, on a subatomic level. It is a young planet. All itsenergy processes are still in the uphill stage, so to speak; they areevolutionary, making for complexification, and therefore, the destruction ofnegative forces. A simple example of this is the way that so many of theromantics died young; the earth simply will not tolerate subversive forces.Hence the legend that the Lloigor created men as their slaves. For why shouldall-powerful beings require slaves? Only because of the active hostility, so tospeak, of the earth itself. To counteract this hostility, to carry out theirsimplest purposes, they needed creatures who worked on an optimistic basis. Andso men were created, deliberately short-sighted creatures, incapable of steadilycontemplating the obvious truth about the universe.What had then happened had been absurd. The Lloigor had been increasinglyweakened by their life on earth. Urquart said that the documents offer noreasons for the Lloigor’s leaving their home, probably situated in the Andromedanebula. They had gradually become less and less an active force. And theirslaves had taken over, becoming the men of today. The Naacal tablets and otherworks that have come down from Mu are the creation of these men, not of theoriginal “gods.” The earth has favoured the evolution of its ungainly,optimistic children, and weakened the Lloigor. Nevertheless, these ancientpowers remain. They have retreated under the earth and sea, in order toconcentrate their power in stones and rocks, whose normal metabolism they canreverse. This has enabled them to cling to the earth for many thousands ofyears. Occasionally, they accumulate enough energy to erupt once again intohuman life, and the results are whole cities destroyed. At one time, it was thewhole continent—Mu itself—and later still, Atlantis. They had always beenparticularly virulent when they had been able to find traces of their previousslaves. They are responsible for many archaeological mysteries—great ruinedcities of South America, Cambodia, Burma, Ceylon, North Africa, even Italy. Andthen, according to Urquart, the two great ruined cities of North America, GrudènItzà, now sunk beneath the swampland around New Orleans, and Nam-Ergest, aflourishing city that once stood on the land where the Grand Canyon now yawns.The Grand Canyon, Urquart said, was not created by earth erosion, but by atremendous underground explosion followed by a “hail of fire.” He suspects that,like the great Siberian explosion, it was produced by some kind of atomic bomb.To my question of why there were not signs of an explosion around the GrandCanyon, Urquart had two replies: that it had taken place so long ago that mostsigns of it had been destroyed by natural forces, and second, that to anyunprejudiced observer, it is plain enough that the Grand Canyon is an immenseand irregular crater.After two hours of this, and several helpings of his excellent whisky, I felt soconfused that I had completely lost track of the questions I wanted to ask. Isaid I had to go to bed and think about it all, and the Colonel offered to runme home in his car. One of my questions came back to me as I climbed into thepassenger seat of the ancient Rolls-Royce.“What did you mean about the Welsh being survivors of Mu?”“What I said. I am certain—I have evidence to prove—that they are descendents ofthe slaves of the Lloigor.”“What kind of evidence?”“All kinds. It would take another hour to explain.”“Couldn’t you give me some hint?”“All right. Look in the paper in the morning. Tell me what strikes you.”“But what am I to look for?”He was amused by my refusal to “wait and see.” He should have known that old menare less patient than children.“The crime figures.”“Can’t you tell me more?”“All right.” We were parked outside the hotel by now, and it was still rainingheavily. At this hour of the night, there was no sound but the fall of rain andthe gurgling of water in the gutters. “You’ll find that the crime rate in thisarea is three times that of the rest of England. The figures are so high thatthey’re seldom published. Murder, cruelty, rape, every possible kind of sexualperversion—this area has the highest figures in the British Isles.”“But why?”“I’ve told you. The Lloigor achieve the strength to reappear every now andthen.” And to make it clear that he wanted to go home, he leaned over and openedmy door for me. Before I had reached the door of the hotel, he had driven off.I asked the caretaker on duty if I could borrow a local newspaper; he producedme one from his cubbyhole, which he said I could keep. I went up to my coldroom, undressed and climbed into bed—there was a hot-water bottle in it. Then Iglanced through the newspaper. At first sight, I could see no evidence forUrquart’s assertion. The headline was about a strike in the local dockyard, andthe lead stories were about a local cattle show in which the judges had beenaccused of accepting bribes, and about a Southport girl swimmer who had almostbroken the record for the cross-Channel swim. On the middle page, the editorialwas on some question of Sunday observance. It looked innocent enough.Then I began to notice the small paragraphs, tucked away next to theadvertisements or among the sports news. The headless body that had been foundfloating in the Bryn Mawr reservoir has been tentatively identified as a teenagefarm girl from Llandalffen. A fourteen-year-old boy sentenced to a correctiveinstitution for inflicting injuries on a sheep with a hatchet. A farmerpetitioning for divorce on the grounds that his wife seemed to be infatuatedwith her imbecile stepson. A vicar sentenced to a year in prison for offencesagainst choirboys. A father who had murdered his daughter and her boyfriend outof sexual jealousy. A man in the old-folks’ home who had incinerated two of hiscompanions by pouring paraffin on their beds and setting them alight. Atwelve-year-old boy who had offered his twin sisters, age seven, ice cream withrat poison sprinkled on it, and then laughed uncontrollably in the juvenilecourt. (The children luckily survived with bad stomach-aches.) A short paragraphsaying that the police had now charged a man with the three Lovers’ Lanemurders.I jotted these down in the order I read them. It was quite a chronicle for apeaceful rural area, even allowing that Southport and Cardiff, with their highercrime rates, were fairly close. Admittedly, it was not too bad a record comparedto most places in America. Even Charlottesville can produce a crime record thatwould be regarded as a major crime wave in England. Before falling asleep, Ipulled on my dressing gown, and found my way down to the lounge, where I hadseen a copy of Whitaker’s Almanac, and looked up the English crime rate. A mere166 murders in 1967—three murders to every million people of the population;America’s murder rate is about twenty times as high. Yet here, in a single issueof a small local newspaper, I had found mention of nine murders—althoughadmittedly, some of them dated back a long way. (The Lovers’ Lane murders werespread over eighteen months.)I slept very badly that night, my mind running constantly on invisible monsters,awful cataclysms, sadistic murderers, demoniac teenagers. It was a relief towake up to bright sunlight and a cup of morning tea. Even so, I found myselfstealing a look at the maid—a pale-faced little thing with dull eyes and stringyhair—and wondering what irregular union had produced her. I had breakfast andthe morning paper sent up to my room, and read it with morbid interest.Again, the more lurid news was carefully tucked away in small paragraphs. Twoeleven-year-old schoolboys were accused of being implicated in the murder of theheadless girl, but claimed that a tramp “with smouldering eyes” had actuallydecapitated her. A Southport druggist forced to resign from the town councilwhen accused of having “carnal knowledge” of his fourteen-year-old assistant.Evidence suggesting that a deceased midwife had been a successful baby farmer inthe manner of the infamous Mrs. Dyer of Reading. An old lady of Llangwmseriously injured by a man who accused her of witchcraft—of causing babies to beborn with deformities. An attempt on the life of the mayor of Chepstow by a manwith some obscure grudge.… I omit more than half of the list, for the crimes areas dull as they are sordid.There was no doubt that all this brooding on crime and corruption was having itseffect on my outlook. I had always liked the Welsh, with their small stature anddark hair and pale skins. Now I found myself looking at them as if they weretroglodytes, trying to find evidence of secret vices in their eyes. And the moreI looked, the more I saw it. I observed the number of words beginning with twoL’s, from Lloyd’s Bank to Llandudno, and thought of the Lloigor with a shudder.(Incidentally, I thought the word familiar, and found it on page 258 of theLovecraft Shuttered Room volume, listed as the god “who walks the winds amongthe star-spaces.” I also found Ghatanothoa, the Dark God, mentioned there,although not as the chief of the “star dwellers.”)It was almost intolerable, walking along that sunlit street, looking at therural population going about their everyday business of shopping and admiringone another’s babies, to feel this awful secret inside me, struggling to getout. I wanted to dismiss the whole thing as a nightmare, the invention of onehalf-crazed mind; then I had to acknowledge that it all followed logically fromthe Voynich manuscript and the Lovecraft gods. Yes, there could hardly be anydoubt: Lovecraft and Machen had simply obtained some knowledge of an ancienttradition that may have existed before any known civilisation on earth.The only other alternative was some elaborate literary hoax, organised betweenMachen, Lovecraft, and Voynich, who must be regarded as a forger, and that wasimpossible. But what an alternative! How could I believe in it and still feelsane, here in this sunlit high street, with the lilting sound of Welsh in myears? Some evil, dark world, so alien from ours that human beings cannot evenbegin to understand it; strange powers whose actions seem incredibly cruel andvengeful, yet who are simply driven by abstract laws of their being that wouldbe incomprehensible to us. Urquart, with his reptilian face and his moroseintelligence. And above all, unseen forces bending the minds of these apparentlyinnocent people around me, making them corrupt and depraved.I had already decided what I would do that day. I would get Mr. Evans to driveme out to the “Grey Hills” mentioned by Machen, and take some photographs, andmake some discreet enquiries. I even had a compass with me—one I usually kept inmy car in America—in case I managed to lose my way.There was a small crowd gathered outside Mr. Evans’s garage and an ambulancestood by the pavement. As I approached, two attendants came out, carrying astretcher. I saw Mr. Evans standing gloomily inside the small shop attached tothe garage, watching the crowd. I asked him:“What happened?”“Chap upstairs committed suicide in the night. Gassed himself.”As the ambulance pulled away, I asked, “Don’t you think there’s rather a lot ofthat around here?”“Of what?”“Suicides, murders, and so on. Your local paper’s full of it.”“I suppose so. It’s the teenagers nowadays. They do what they like.”I saw there was no point in pursuing the subject. I asked him whether he wasfree to drive me to the Grey Hills. He shook his head.“I promised I’d wait around to make a statement to the police. You’re welcome touse the car if you want it.”And so I bought a map of the area, and drove myself. I stopped for ten minutesto admire the mediaeval bridge, mentioned by Machen, then drove slowly north.The morning was windy, but not cold, and the sunlight made the scene looktotally different from the previous afternoon. Although I looked out carefullyfor signs of Machen’s Grey Hills, I saw nothing in the pleasant, rollinglandscape that seemed to answer that description. Soon I found myself passing asignpost that announced Abergavenny ten miles away. I decided to take a look atthe place. By the time I arrived there, the sunlight had so far dispelled thenight vapours from my head that I drove round the town—unremarkable enougharchitecturally—and then walked up to look at the ruined castle above it. Ispoke to a couple of natives, who struck me as more English than Welsh in type.Indeed, the town is not many miles away from the Severn Valley and A. E.Housman’s Shropshire.But I was reminded of the myth of the Lloigor by a few sentences in the localguidebook about William de Braose, Lord of Brecheiniog (Brecon), “whose shadowbroods darkly over the past of Abergavenny,” whose “foul deeds” had apparentlyshocked even the lawless English of the twelfth century. I made a mental note toask Urquart how long the Lloigor had been present in South Wales, and how fartheir influence extended. I drove on northwest, through the most attractive partof the valley of the Usk. At Crickhowell, I stopped in a pleasantlyold-fashioned pub and drank a cool pint of mild ale, and fell into conversationwith a local who proved to have read Machen. I asked him where he supposed the“Grey Hills” to be situated, and he told me confidently that it was directly tothe north, in the Black Mountains, the high, wild moorland between the valleysof Usk and the Wye. So I drove on for another half hour, to the top of the passcalled the Bwlch, where the scenery is among the finest in Wales, with theBrecon Beacons to the west, and woodland and hills to the south, with glimpsesof the Usk reflecting the sunlight. But the Black Mountains to the east lookedanything but menacing, and their description did not correspond to the page inMachen that I was using as a guide. So I turned south once again, throughAbergavenny (where I ate a light lunch), and then through minor roads toLlandalffen, the road climbing steeply again.It was here that I began to suspect that I was approaching my objective. Therewas a barrenness about the hills that suggested the atmosphere of “The Novel ofthe Black Seal.” But I kept an open mind, for the afternoon had become cloudy,and I suspected it might be pure imagination. I stopped the car by the roadside,close to a stone bridge, and got out to lean on the parapet. It was afast-flowing stream, and the glassy power of the current fascinated me until Ifelt almost hypnotised by it. I walked down by the side of the bridge, diggingin my heels to keep my balance on the steep slope, and went down to a flat rockbeside the stream. This was almost an act of bravado, for I felt a distinctdiscomfort, which I knew to be partly self-induced. A man of my age tends tofeel tired and depressed after lunch, particularly when he has been drinking.I had my Polaroid camera round my neck. The green of the grass and the grey ofthe sky made such a contrast that I decided to take a picture. I adjusted thelight meter on the front of the camera, and pointed the camera upstream; then Ipulled out the photograph, and slipped it under my coat to develop. A minutelater, I stripped off the negative paper. The photograph was black. Obviously,it had somehow been exposed to light. I raised the camera and took a secondshot, tossing the first one into the stream. As I pulled the second photographfrom the camera, I had a sudden intuitive certainty that it would also be black.I looked nervously around, and almost tripped into the stream as I saw a facelooking down at me from the bridge above. It was a boy, or a youth, leaning onthe parapet, watching me. My timing device stopped buzzing. Ignoring the boy, Istripped the paper off the photograph. It was black. I swore under my breath,and tossed it into the stream. Then I looked up the slope to calculate theeasiest way back, and saw the youth standing at the top. He was dressed inshabby brown clothes, completely nondescript. His face was thin and brown,reminding me of gypsies I had seen on the station in Newport. The brown eyeswere expressionless. I stared back at him without smiling, at first only curiousas to what he wanted.But he made no apologetic movement, and I felt suddenly afraid that he wanted torob me—perhaps of the camera, or the traveller’s cheques in my wallet. Anotherlook at him convinced me that he would not know what to do with either. Thevacant eyes and the protruding ears indicated that I was dealing with animbecile. And then, with sudden total certainty, I knew what he had in mind asclearly as if he had told me. He meant to rush at me down the slope, and knockme backwards into the water. But why? I glanced at the water. It was very fast,and perhaps waist-deep—perhaps a little more—but not deep enough to drown agrown man. There were rocks and stones in it, but none large enough to hurt meif I was dashed against it.Nothing like this had ever happened to me before—at least, for the past fiftyyears. Weakness and fear flowed over me, so that I wanted to sit down. Only mydetermination not to betray fear prevented me. I made an effort, and scowled athim in an irritable manner, as I have occasionally scowled at my students. To mysurprise, he smiled at me—although I think it was a smile of malice rather thanof amusement—and turned away. I lost no time in scrambling up the bank to a lessvulnerable position.When I reached the road a few seconds later he was gone. The only cover withinfifty yards was the other side of the bridge, or behind my car. I bent to peerunder the car, to see if his feet were visible; they weren’t. I overcame mypanic, and went to look over the other parapet of the bridge. He wasn’t thereeither. The only other possibility was that he had slipped under the bridge,although the water seemed to be flowing too fast. In any case, I was not goingto look down there. I went back to the car, forcing myself not to hurry, andonly felt safe when I was in motion.At the top of the hill, it struck me that I had forgotten which way I wastravelling. My alarm had completely erased all memory of which way I hadapproached the bridge, and I had parked in a gateway, at right angles to theroad. I stopped on a lonely stretch of road to look at my compass. But its blackpole swung gently in circles, apparently indifferent to direction. Tapping madeno difference. It was not broken; the needle was still mounted on its pivot. Itwas simply demagnetised. I drove on until I found a signpost, discovered I wasgoing in the right direction, and made my way to Pontypool. The problem of thecompass disturbed me vaguely, but not unduly. It was only later, when I thoughtabout it, that I realised that it should be impossible to demagnetise a compasswithout removing the needle and heating it, or banging it about prettyvigorously. It had been working at lunchtime, when I had glanced at it. It cameto me then that the affair of the compass, like the boy, had been intended as awarning. A vague, indifferent warning, like a sleeping man brushing at a fly.All this sounds absurd and fanciful; and I freely admit that I was half inclinedto dismiss it myself. But I am inclined to trust my intuitions.I was feeling shaken, enough to take a long swallow from my brandy flask when Iarrived back at the hotel. Then I called the desk and complained about thecoldness of my room, and within ten minutes, a chambermaid was making a coalfire in a grate I had not even noticed. Seated in front of it, smoking a pipeand sipping brandy, I began to feel better. After all, there was no evidencethat these “powers” were actively hostile—even admitting for a moment that theyexisted. As a young man I was scornful about the supernatural, but as I have gotolder, the sharp line that divided the credible from the incredible has tendedto blur; I am aware that the whole world is slightly incredible.At six o’clock, I suddenly decided to go and see Urquart. I didn’t bother toring, for I had come to think of him as an ally, not as a stranger. So I walkedin the thin drizzle to his house, and rang the front doorbell. Almostimmediately, it opened, and a man came out. The Welshwoman said, “Goodbye,Doctor,” and I stood and stared at her, feeling sudden fear.“Is the Colonel all right?”The doctor answered me. “Well enough, if he takes care. If you’re a friend ofhis, don’t stay with him too long. He needs sleep.”The Welshwoman let me in without question.“What happened?”“Little accident. He fell down the cellar steps, and we didn’t find him for acouple of hours.”As I went upstairs, I noticed some of the dogs in the kitchen. The door wasopen, yet they had not barked at the sound of my voice. The upstairs corridorwas damp and badly carpeted. The Doberman lay outside a door. It looked at me ina weary, subdued way, and did not stir as I went in past it.Urquart said: “Ah, it’s you, old boy. Nice of you to come. Who told you?”“Nobody. I came to see you for a talk. What happened?”He waited until his housekeeper closed the door.“I got pushed down the cellar steps.”“By whom?”“You shouldn’t have to ask that.”“But what happened?”“I went down to the cellar to get some garden twine. Halfway down the steps—anasty, stifling feeling—I think they can produce some sort of gas. Then adefinite push sideways. There’s quite a drop down to the coal. Twisted my ankle,and thought I’d broken a rib. Then the door closed and latched. I shouted like amadman for two hours before the gardener heard me.”I didn’t doubt his word now, or think him a crank. “But you’re in obvious dangerhere. You ought to move to some other part of the country.”“No. They’re a lot stronger than I thought. But after all, I was below ground,in the cellar. That may be the explanation. They can reach above ground, but itcosts them more energy than it’s worth. Anyway, there’s no harm done. Theankle’s only sprained and the rib isn’t broken after all. It was just a gentlewarning—for talking to you last night. What’s been happening to you?”“So that’s it!” My own experiences now connected up. I told him what hadhappened to me.He interrupted me to say, “You went down a steep bank—you see, just like me intothe cellar. A thing to avoid.” And when I mentioned the compass, he laughedwithout much humour. “That’s easy for them. I told you, they can permeate matteras easily as a sponge soaks up water. Have a drink?”I accepted, and poured him one too. As he sipped, he said, “That boy youmentioned—I think I know who it is. The grandson of Ben Chickno. I’ve seen himaround.”“Who is Chickno?”“Gypsy. Half his family are idiots. They all interbreed. One of his sons gotfive years for involvement in a murder—one of the nastiest that ever happenedaround here. They tortured an old couple to find out where they kept theirmoney, then killed them. They found some of the stolen goods in the son’scaravan, but he claimed they had been left there by a man on the run. He waslucky to escape a murder charge. And incidentally, the judge died a week aftersentencing the son. Heart attack.”I knew my Machen better than Urquart did, and the suspicion that now came to mewas natural. For Machen speaks of intercourse between certain half-imbeciliccountry people and his strange powers of evil. I asked Urquart, “Could this oldman—Chickno—be connected with the Lloigor?”“It depends what you mean by connected. I don’t think he’s important enough toknow much about them. But he’s the kind of person they like to encourage—adegenerate old swine. You want to ask Inspector Davison about him; he’s the headof the local force. Chickno’s got a string of convictions as long as yourarm—arson, rape, robbery with violence, bestiality, incest. Just a thoroughdegenerate.”Mrs. Dolgelly brought in his supper at this point, and intimated that it wastime for me to go. At the door, I asked, “Is this man’s caravan anywherenearby?”“About a mile away from the bridge you mentioned. You’re not thinking of goingthere, I hope?”Nothing was further from my thoughts, and I said so.That evening, I wrote a long letter to George Lauerdale at Brown University.Lauerdale writes detective stories under a pseudonym, and has been responsiblefor two anthologies of modern poetry. I knew him to be writing a book aboutLovecraft, and I needed his advice. By now, I had a feeling of being totallyinvolved in this business. I no longer had any doubts. So was there any evidenceof the Lloigor in the Providence area? I wanted to know if anyone had theoriesabout where Lovecraft obtained his basic information. Where had he seen or heardof the Necronomicon? I took care to hide my real preoccupations in my letter toLauerdale, I explained simply that I had succeeded in translating a large partof the Voynich manuscript, and that I had reason to believe that it was theNecronomicon referred to by Lovecraft, how could Lauerdale account for this? Iwent on to say that there was evidence that Machen had used real legends ofMonmouthshire in his stories, and that I suspected similar legends underlyingLovecraft’s work. Had he any knowledge of any such local legends? For example,were there any unpleasant stories connected with Lovecraft’s “shunned house” onBenefit Street in Providence …?The day after Urquart’s accident, a curious thing happened, which I shallmention only briefly, since it had no sequel. I have already mentioned thechambermaid, a pale-faced girl with stringy hair and thin legs. After breakfast,I went up to my room and found her apparently unconscious on the hearth-rug. Itried to call the desk, but got no reply. She seemed small and light, so Idecided to move her onto the bed, or onto the armchair. This was not difficult;but as I lifted her, it was impossible not to become aware that she seemed to bewearing little or nothing under the brown overall-smock. This made me wonder;the weather was cold. Then, as I laid her down, she opened her eyes, and staredup at me with a cunning delight that convinced me that she had been shamming,and one of her hands caught the wrist that was trying to disengage itself fromher, with the unmistakable intention of prolonging our contact.But it was all done a little too crudely, and I started up. As I did so, I hearda step outside the door and quickly opened it. A rough-looking man with agypsyish face was standing there, and he looked startled to see me. He startedto say: “I was looking for …,” then he saw the girl in the room.I said quickly, “I found her unconscious on the floor. I’ll get a doctor.” Myonly intention was to escape downstairs, but the girl overheard me and said, “Noneed for that,” jumping up off the bed. The man turned and walked off, and shefollowed him a few seconds later without attempting an excuse. It took noparticular subtlety to see what had been planned; he was supposed to open thedoor and find me in the act of making love to her. I cannot guess what wassupposed to happen then; perhaps he would demand money. But I think it morelikely that he would have attacked me. There was a definite family resemblanceto the youth who had stared at me from the bridge. I never saw him again, andthe girl seemed disposed to avoid me thereafter.The episode made me more certain than ever that the gypsy family was moreintimately involved with the Lloigor than Urquart realised. I rang his home, butwas told that he was sleeping. I spent the rest of the day writing letters home,and examining the Roman remains in the town.That evening, I saw Chickno for the first time. On the way to Urquart’s, I hadto pass a small public house, with a notice in the window: NO GYPSIES. Yet inthe doorway of the pub stood an old man dressed in baggy clothes—aharmless-looking old man—who watched me pass with his hands in his pockets. Hewas smoking a cigarette which dangled loosely from his lips. He was unmistakablya gypsy.I told Urquart about the episode of the chambermaid, but he seemed inclined todismiss it; at worst, he thought they might have intended to blackmail me. Butwhen I mentioned the old man, he became more interested, and made me describehim in detail. “That was Chickno, all right. I wonder what the devil he wants.”“He looked harmless,” I said.“About as harmless as a poison spider.”The encounter with Chickno disturbed me. I hope I am no more of a physicalcoward than the next man; but the youth by the bridge, and the chambermaidbusiness, made me realise that we are all pretty vulnerable physically. If thechambermaid’s boyfriend—or brother, or whoever it was—had chosen to hit me hardin the stomach, he could have beaten me into unconsciousness, or broken all myribs without my making a sound. And no court would have convicted a man tryingto defend a girl’s “honour,” especially when she alleged that she woke up from afaint to find herself being ravished.… The thought gave me a most unpleasantsensation in the stomach, and a real fear that I was playing with fire.This fear explains the next event that I must describe. But I should mentionthat Urquart was out of bed on the third day, and that we drove out togetherthrough the Grey Hills, trying to find out whether there was any substance inMachen’s mention of underground caves that were supposed to house his malicioustroglodytes. We questioned the vicar in Llandalffen, and in two nearby villages,and talked to several farm-workers we met, explaining that we were interested inpot-holing. No one questioned our unlikely excuse, but no one had anyinformation, although the minister in Llandalffen said he had heard stories ofrumours of openings in hillsides, concealed by boulders.Urquart was exhausted after his day of limping around with me, and went home atsix o’clock, intending to get an early night. On my way home, I thought—orperhaps imagined—that a gypsyish-looking man followed me for several hundredyards. Someone resembling the youth was hanging around the entrance to thehotel, and walked away as I appeared. I began to feel a marked man. But aftersupper, feeling more comfortable, I decided to walk to the pub where I had seenold Chickno, and enquire discreetly whether he was known there.When I was still a quarter of a mile from the place, I saw him standing in thedoorway of a dairy, watching me, with no attempt to disguise the fact. I knewthat if I ignored him, my feeling of insecurity would increase, and that itmight cost me a sleepless night. So I did what I sometimes do to the monsters innightmares—walked up to him and accosted him. I had the satisfaction of seeing,for a moment, that I had taken him by surprise. The watery eyes glanced awayquickly—the action of a man who usually had something on his conscience.Then, as I came up to him, I realised that the direct approach would bepointless—“Why are you following me?” He would react with the instinctivecunning of a man who is usually on the wrong side of the law, and flatly denyit. So instead, I smiled and said, “Pleasant evening.” He grinned at me andsaid, “Oh ay.” Then I stood beside him and pretended to be watching the world gopast. I had another of my intuitive insights. He was slightly uncomfortable tobe in the position of the hunter, so to speak; he was more used to being thequarry.After a few moments, he said, “You’re a stranger ’round here.” The accent wasnot Welsh; it was harsher, more northern.“Yes, I’m an American,” I said. After a pause, I added, “You’re a stranger too,from the sound of your accent.”“Ay. From Lancashire.”“Which part?”“Downham.”“Ah, the village of the witches.” I had given a course on the Victoriannovelists, and recalled The Lancashire Witches by Ainsworth.He grinned at me, and I saw that he hadn’t a whole tooth in his head; the stumpswere brown and broken. At close quarters, I could also see that I had beencompletely mistaken to think he looked harmless. Urquart’s description of apoison spider was not all that far out. To begin with, he was much older than helooked at a distance—over eighty, I would have guessed. (Rumour had it laterthat he was over a hundred. Certainly his eldest daughter was sixty-five.) Butage had not softened him or made him seem benevolent. There was a loose,degenerate look about him, and a kind of unpleasant vitality, as if he couldstill enjoy inflicting pain or causing fear. Even to talk with him was aslightly worrying sensation, like patting a dog you suspect has rabies. Urquarthad told me some pretty disgusting rumours about him, but I could now believethem all. I recalled a story about the small daughter of a farm labourer who hadaccepted his hospitality one rainy night, and found it hard to keep my disgustfrom showing.We stood there for several minutes more, looking at the lighted street and thefew teenagers carrying portable radios who sauntered past, ignoring us.“ ’Old out your ’and,” he said.I did so. He stared at it with interest. Then he traced with his thumb the linesacross the base of my right thumb.“Long lifeline.”“I’m glad to hear that. Can you see anything else?”He looked at me and grinned maliciously. “Nuthin’ that’d interest you.”There was something unreal about this interview. I glanced at my watch. “Timefor a drink.” I started to walk away, then said, as if the idea had justoccurred to me, “Care to join me?”“I don’t mind if I do.” But the smile was so frankly insulting that anyonewithout ulterior motive would have taken offence. I knew what he wasthinking—that I was afraid of him and wanted to try to win him over. There wassome truth in the first part; none in the second. I felt that his failure tounderstand me gave me a slight advantage.We walked to the pub I had intended to visit. Then I saw the notice in thewindow, and hesitated.“Don’t worry. That doesn’t apply to me,” he said.A moment later, I saw why. The bar was half full. Several labourers were playingdarts. Chickno made straight for the seat under the dartboard and sat down. Afew of the men looked angry, but none said anything. They put the darts on thewindowsill, and went back to the bar. Chickno grinned. I could see he enjoyedshowing his power.He said he would have a rum. I went to the bar, and the landlord served mewithout looking me full in the face. People moved unobtrusively to the otherside of the bar, or at least as far from us as they conveniently could withoutbeing obvious. Clearly, Chickno was feared. Perhaps the death of the judge whosentenced his son had something to do with it; later, Urquart told me of otherthings.One thing made me feel less worried. He could not hold his drink. I had boughthim a single rum, in case he thought I was trying to get him drunk, but helooked at it and said, “Bit small, that,” so I ordered a second. He had drunkthe first before I brought the second over. And ten minutes later, his eyes hadlost some of their cunning and sharpness.I decided I had nothing to lose by frankness. “I’ve heard about you, Mr.Chickno. I’m most interested to meet you.”He said, “Ay. ’Appen you are.” He sipped thoughtfully at the second rum, andsucked at a hollow tooth. Then he said: “You look a sensible fellow. Why do youstay where you’re not wanted?”I didn’t pretend to misunderstand.“I’m leaving soon—probably at the end of the week. But I came here to try andfind something. Have you heard of the Voynich manuscript?” He obviously hadn’t.So in spite of a feeling that I was wasting my breath—he was looking past meblankly—I told him briefly about the history of the manuscript, and how I haddeciphered it. I ended by saying that Machen had also seemed to know the work,and that I suspected that its other half, or perhaps another copy, might be inthis part of the world. When he answered, I saw that I had been mistaken tothink him stupid or inattentive.“So you want me to believe you’re in this part lookin’ for a manuscript? Is thatall?” he said.The tone had a Lancashire bluntness, but was not hostile. I said, “That’s thereason I came here.”He leaned across the table, and breathed rum on me. “Look ’ere, mister, I know alot more than you think. I know everything about you. So let’s not ’ave any ofthis. You may be a college professor, but you don’t impress me.” I had a strongimpression that I was looking at a rat or a weasel—a feeling that he wasdangerous, and ought to be destroyed, like a dangerous snake—but I made aneffort to keep this out of my eyes. I suddenly knew something else about him; hewas impressed by the fact that I was a professor, and was enjoying his positionof virtually giving me orders to go away and mind my own business.So I drew a deep breath and said politely, “Believe me, Mr. Chickno, my maininterest is in that manuscript. If I could find that, I’d be perfectly happy.”He drained his rum, and for a moment I thought he was going to walk out. But heonly wanted another. I went to the bar and got him a double, and another Haigfor myself.When I sat down again, he took a good swallow of the rum. “I know why you’re’ere, mister. I know about your book as well. I’m not a vindictive sort ofbloke. All I’m saying is that nobody’s interested in you. So why don’t you goback to America? You won’t find the rest of your book round ’ere, I can tell youthat.”Neither of us said anything for a few minutes. Then I decided to try completefrankness. “Why do they want me to go?”For a moment, he didn’t take in what I had said. Then his face became sober andserious—but only briefly. “Better not to talk of it.” But after a moment, heseemed to think better of his suggestion. His eyes were malicious again. Heleaned forward to me. “They’re not interested in you, mister. They couldn’t careless about you. It’s ’im they don’t like.” His head jerked vaguely—I gather hemeant Urquart. “He’s a fool. He’s had plenty of warning, and you can tell himfrom me, they won’t bother to warn him next time.”“He doesn’t think they have any power. Not enough to harm him,” I said.He seemed unable to make up his mind whether to smile or sneer. His facecontorted, and for a moment, I had the illusion that his eyes had turned red,like a spider’s. Then he spat out: “Then he’s nothing but a bleeding——fool, andhe deserves what he gets.”While I felt a twinge of fear, I also felt a touch of triumph. He had started totalk. My frankness had paid off. And unless he suddenly became cautious again, Iwas close to finding out some of the things I wanted to know.He controlled himself, then said, less violently, “First of all, he’s a foolbecause he doesn’t really know anything. Not a bloody thing.” He tapped my wristwith a bent forefinger.“I suspected that,” I said.“You did, did you? Well, you were right. All this stuff about Atlantis.” Therewas no doubt that scorn was real. But what he said next shocked me more thananything so far. He leaned forward, and said with an odd sincerity: “Thesethings aren’t out of a fairy story, you know. They’re not playing games.”And I understood something that had not been clear to me so far. He knew “them,”knew them with the indifferent realism of a scientist referring to the atomicbomb. I think that, up to this point, I had not really believed in “them”; I hadbeen hoping that it was all some odd delusion; or that, like ghosts, they couldnot impinge on human affairs to any practical extent. His words made meunderstand my mistake. “These things.” My hair stirred, and I felt the coldflowing down my legs to my feet.“What are they doing, then?”He emptied the glass, and said casually, “That’s nuthin’ to do wi’ you, mate.You can’t do anything about it. Nobody can.” He set down the glass. “You see,this is their world anyway. We’re a mistake. They want it back again.” He caughtthe eye of the barman, and pointed to his glass.I went over and collected another rum for him. Now I wanted to leave as soon aspossible, to speak to Urquart. But it would be difficult, without running therisk of offending him.Chickno solved my problem. After his third double rum, he abruptly ceased to beintelligible. He muttered things in a language which I took to be Romany. Hementioned a “Liz Southern” several times, pronouncing it “Sowthern,” and it wasonly later that I recalled that this was the name of one of the Lancashirewitches, executed in 1612. I never found out what he was saying, or whether hewas, in fact, referring to the witch. His eyes became glassy, although heobviously thought he was still communicating something to me. Finally, I had theeerie impression that it was no longer old Chickno who was talking to me, butthat he was possessed by some other creature. Half an hour later, he was dozingwith his head on the table. I crossed to the barman.“I’m sorry about this.” I pointed to old Chickno.“That’s all right,” he said. I think he had gathered by then that I was not afriend of the gypsy’s. “I’ll phone his grandson. He’ll take him home.”I rang Urquart’s house from the nearest phone box. His housekeeper said he wasasleep. I was tempted to go over and wake him, then decided against it, and wentback to the hotel wishing I had someone to talk to.I tried to sort out my thoughts, to see some meaning in what Chickno had said.If he didn’t deny the reality of the Lloigor, then why was Urquart so wrong? ButI had drunk too much, and I felt exhausted. I fell asleep at midnight, but sleptbadly, haunted by nightmares. At two in the morning, I woke up with a horriblesense of the evil reality of the Lloigor, although it was mixed up in my mindwith my nightmares about the Marquis de Sade and Jack the Ripper. My sense ofdanger was so strong that I switched on the light. This improved things. Then Idecided that I had better write down my conversation with Chickno and give it toUrquart to read, in case he could add some of the missing parts to the jigsaw. Iwrote it down in detail.My fingers numb with the cold, I slept again, but was awakened by a fainttrembling of the room, which reminded me of an earthquake tremor I experiencedonce in Mexico. Then I slept again until morning.Before going in to breakfast, I enquired at the desk for mail. There was a replyto my letter from Lauerdale at Brown, and I read it as I ate my kippers.Much of the letter was literary—a discussion of Lovecraft and his psychology.But there were pages that held far more interest for me. Lauerdale wrote: “Imyself am inclined to believe, on the evidence of letters, that one of the mostimportant experiences in Lovecraft’s early life was a visit to Cohasset, arun-down fishing village between Quonochontaug and Weekapaug in Southern RhodeIsland. Like Lovecraft’s ‘Innsmouth,’ this village was later to vanish from themaps. I have been there, and its description corresponds in many ways toLovecraft’s description of Innsmouth—which Lovecraft placed in Massachusetts:‘more empty houses than people,’ the air of decay, the stale fish smell. Therewas actually a character known as Captain Marsh living in Cohasset in 1915, whenLovecraft was there, who had spent some time in the South Seas. It may have beenhe who told the young Lovecraft the stories of evil Polynesian temples andundersea people. The chief of these legends—as mentioned also by Jung andSpence—is of gods from the stars (or demons) who were once lords of this earth,who lost their power through the practise of evil magic, but who will one dayreturn and take over the earth again. In the version quoted by Jung, these godsare said to have created human beings from subhuman monsters.“In my own opinion, Lovecraft derived the rest of the ‘mythos’ from Machen,perhaps from Poe, who occasionally hints at such things. ‘MS. Found in aBottle,’ for example. I found no evidence that there were ever sinister rumoursconnected with the ‘shunned house’ in Benefit Street, or any other house inProvidence. I shall be extremely interested to read what you have to say aboutMachen’s sources. While I think it is just possible that Machen heard some storyabout some ‘arcane’ volume of the sort you mention, I can find no evidence thatLovecraft had firsthand acquaintance with such a book. I am sure that anyconnection between his Necronomicon and the Voynich MS. is, as you suggest,coincidence.”My hair stirred as I read the sentence about gods “who will one day return andtake over the earth again,” as also about the reference to Polynesian legends.For, as Churchward has written: “Easter Island, Tahiti, Samoas,… Hawaii, and theMarquesas are the pathetic fingers of that great land, standing today assentinels of a silent grave.” Polynesia is the remains of Mu.All this told me little more than I knew already, or had guessed. But myencounter with Chickno raised a practical problem: how far was Urquart actuallyin danger? He might be right that the Lloigor had no power in themselves, orvery little; but Chickno and his family were a different matter. Even taking themost sceptical view of all, that this whole thing was pure imagination andsuperstition, Chickno represented a very real danger. For some reason, theyhated Urquart.The desk clerk touched my sleeve: “Telephone, sir.”It was Urquart. I said, “Thank heavens you rang. I’ve got to talk to you.”“You’ve heard, then?”“Heard what?”“About the explosion? Chickno’s dead.”“What! Are you sure?”“Pretty sure. Although they can’t find much of him.”“I’ll be over right away.”That was the first I heard of the great Llandalffen explosion. I have on my deska volume called Stranger than Logic by the late Frank Edwards, one of thoseslightly unreliable compilations of mysteries and wonders. It has a sectionheaded “The Great Llandalffen Explosion,” and what he says, substantially, isthat the explosion was atomic, and was probably due to a fault in the engines ofan “unidentified flying object”; he quotes the rocket scientist Willey Ley tothe effect that the Siberian crater of 1908 may have been an explosion ofantimatter, and draws parallels between the Llandalffen explosion and thePodkamennaya Tunguska fall. This I flatly hold to be absurd. I saw the area ofthe explosion, and there was not nearly enough damage for an atomic explosion,even a small one.However, I am running ahead of my story. Urquart met me halfway to his house,and we drove out to Llandalffen. What had happened was simply that there hadbeen a tremendous explosion at about four o’clock that morning; it may have beenthis that shook me awake in the early hours. The area is deserted, luckily, buta farm-labourer in a cottage three miles away was thrown out of bed by theexplosion. The strangest feature of the whole affair is that it made so littleactual noise; the farm-labourer thought it was an earth tremor, and went back tosleep. Two men in the village, returning home from a party, said they heard theexplosion as a dull sound like distant thunder or blasting, and wondered whethera plane might have crashed with a load of bombs. The farm-labourer pedalled outto investigate at seven in the morning, but found nothing. However, he mentionedit to the farmer who employed him, and the two drove over in the farmer’s car alittle after nine. This time, the farmer turned off down the side road, anddrove towards the gypsy caravans, which were about two miles farther on. Theirfirst find was not, as Mr. Edwards states, a part of a human body, but part ofthe foreleg of a donkey, which lay in the middle of the road. Beyond this, theydiscovered that stone walls and trees had been flattened. Bits of the caravanand other relics were scattered for hundreds of yards around the focus of theexplosion, the two-acre field in which the caravans had stood.I saw the field myself—we were allowed to approach by the inspector of policefrom Llandalffen, who knew Urquart. My first impression was that it had been anearthquake rather than an ordinary explosion. An explosion produces a crater, orclears a more-or-less flattened area, but the ground here was torn and splitopen as if by a convulsion from underneath. A stream flowed through the field,and it had now turned the area into a lake. On the other hand, there werecertain signs that are characteristic of an explosion. Some trees wereflattened, or reduced to broken stumps, but others were untouched. The wallbetween the field and the main road was almost intact, although it ran along thetop of a raised mound or dyke, yet a wall much farther away in the next fieldhad been scattered over a wide area.There were also, of course, the disfigured human and animal relics that we hadexpected to find; shreds of skin, fragments of bone. Few of them wereidentifiable; the explosion seemed to have fragmented every living creature inthe field. The donkey’s leg found by the farmer was the largest segmentrecovered.I was soon feeling severely sick, and had to go and sit in the car, but Urquartlimped around for over an hour, picking up various fragments. I heard a policesergeant ask him what he was looking for, and Urquart said he didn’t know. But Iknew; he was hoping for some definite evidence to connect the gypsies with Mu.And somehow, I was certain that he wouldn’t find it.By now there must have been a thousand sightseers around the area, trying toapproach closely enough to find out what happened. Our car was stopped a dozenor more times as we tried to drive away. Urquart told everyone who asked himthat he thought a flying saucer had exploded.In fact, we were both fairly certain what had happened. I believe that oldChickno had gone too far—that he told me too much. Urquart thinks that his chiefmistake was to think of the Lloigor as somehow human, and of himself as theirservant, entitled to take certain liberties. He failed to realise that he wascompletely dispensable, and that his naive tendency to boast and present himselfas an ambassador of the Lloigor made him dangerous to them.We reached this conclusion after I had described my talk with Chickno toUrquart. When I had finished reading him my notes, Urquart said, “No wonder theykilled him.”“But he didn’t say much, after all.”“He said enough. And perhaps they thought we could guess more than he said.”We had lunch in the hotel, and regretted it. Everyone seemed to know where wehad been, and they stared at us and tried to overhear our conversation. Thewaiter spent so much time hanging about in the area of our table that themanager finally had to reprimand him. We ate as quickly as we could and wentback to Urquart’s house. There was a fire in the library again, and Mrs.Dolgelly brought in coffee.I can still remember every moment of that afternoon. There was a sense oftension and foreboding, of physical danger. What had impressed Urquart most wasold Chickno’s scorn when I told him that Urquart thought “they” had no realpower. I still remember that stream of contemptuous bad language that had madeseveral people in the pub turn their heads. And Chickno had been proved right.“They” had plenty of power—several kinds of power. For we reached the conclusionthat the devastation of the gypsy encampment was neither earthquake norexplosion, but some kind of mixture of both. An explosion violent enough to ripapart the caravans would have been heard clearly in Southport and Melincourt,and most certainly in Llandalffen, barely five miles away. The clefts and cracksin the earth suggested a convulsion of the ground. But a convulsion of theground would not have torn apart the caravans. Urquart believed—and I finallyagreed with him—that the caravans and their inhabitants had been literally tornapart. But in that case, what was the purpose of the convulsion of the earth?There were two possible explanations. This had happened as the “creatures”forced their way from underground. Or the “earthquake” was a deliberate falsetrail, a red herring. And the consequences that followed from such a suppositionwere so frightening that we poured ourselves whiskies, although it was onlymidafternoon. It meant that “they” were anxious to provide an apparently naturalexplanation for what had happened. And that meant they had a reason for secrecy.And, as far as we could see, there could only be one reason: they had “plans,”plans for the future. I recalled Chickno’s words: “This is their world anyway.…They want it back again.”The frustrating thing was that, in all his books on occultism and the history ofMu, Urquart had nothing that suggested an answer. It was hard to fight off aparalysed feeling of hopelessness, of not knowing where to begin. The eveningpaper increased the depression, for it stated confidently that the explosion hadbeen caused by nitroglycerine! The “experts” had come up with a theory thatseemed to explain the facts. Chickno’s son and son-in-law had worked in stonequarries in the north, and were used to handling explosives. Nitroglycerine wasoccasionally used in these quarries because of its cheapness and because it iseasy to manufacture. According to the newspaper report, Chickno’s sons weresuspected of stealing quantities of glycerine, and of nitric and sulphuric acid.Their intention, said the report, was to use them for blowing safes. They musthave manufactured fairly large quantities of the nitroglycerine, and some kindof earth tremor set it off.It was an absurd explanation; it would have taken a ton of nitroglycerine to doso much damage. In any case, a nitroglycerine explosion leaves behindcharacteristic signs; there were no such signs in the devastated field. Anitroglycerine explosion can be heard; no one heard it.And yet the explanation was never seriously questioned, although there was lateran official investigation into the disaster. Presumably because human beings areafraid of mysteries for which there is absolutely no explanation, the mind needssome solution, no matter how absurd, to reassure it.There was another item in the evening paper that at first seemed irrelevant. Theheadline ran: “Did explosion release mystery gas?” It was only a shortparagraph, which stated that many people in the area had awakened that morningwith bad headaches and a feeling of lassitude, apparently signs of an impendingattack of influenza. These had cleared up later in the day. Had the explosionreleased some gas, asked the reporter, that produced these symptoms? Thenewspaper’s “scientific correspondent” added a note saying that sulphur dioxidecould produce exactly these symptoms, and that several people had noticed such asmell in the night. Nitroglycerine, of course, contains a small quantity ofsulphuric acid, which would account for the smell.…Urquart said, “Soon find out about that, anyway,” and rang the Southport weatherbureau. They rang us back ten minutes later with the answer; the wind had beenblowing from the northeast in the night. And Llandalffen lies to the north ofthe site of the explosion.And still neither of us saw the significance of the item. We wasted hourssearching through my translation of the Voynich manuscript for clues, thenthrough thirty or so books on Mu and related subjects.And then, about to reach down another volume on Lemuria and Atlantis, my eyefell on Sacheverell Sitwell’s book Poltergeists. I stopped and stared. My mindgroped for some fact I had half-forgotten. Then it came.“My god, Urquart,” I said, “I’ve just thought of something. Where do thesecreatures get their energy?” He looked at me blankly. “Is it their own naturalenergy? You need a physical body to generate physical energy. But how aboutpoltergeists …” And then he understood, too. “Poltergeists” take energy fromhuman beings, usually from adolescent girls. One school of thought believes thatpoltergeists have no independent existence; they are some kind of psychicmanifestation from the unconscious mind of the adolescent, an explosion offrustration or craving for attention. The other school believes that they are“spirits” who need to borrow energy from an emotionally disturbed person;Sitwell cites cases of poltergeist disturbances in houses that have remainedempty for long periods.Could this be why so many people in the area felt tired and “fluey” when theywoke up—because the energy for the explosion came from them?If this was so, then the danger was not as serious as we had believed. It meantthat the Lloigor had no energy of their own; they had to draw it frompeople—presumably sleeping people. Their powers were therefore limited.The same thought struck us both at the same time. Except, of course, that theworld is full of people.…Nevertheless, we both felt suddenly more cheerful. And in this new frame ofmind, we faced our fundamental task; to make the human race aware of theLloigor. They were not indestructible, or they would not have bothered todestroy Chickno for talking about them. It might be possible to destroy themwith an underground nuclear explosion. The fact that they had remained dormantfor so many centuries meant that their power was limited. If we could producedefinite proof of their existence, then the possibility of countering the menacewas high.The obvious starting point was the Llandalffen explosion: to make the publicaware that it pointed unmistakably to the reality of these hidden forces. In away, Chickno’s death was the best thing that could have happened; they had showntheir hand. We decided to visit the explosion site again in the morning, and tocompile a dossier on it. We would interview the citizens of Llandalffen and findout whether any of them really had smelled sulphur dioxide in the night, andwhether they would persist in the story when we pointed out that the wind wasblowing in the opposite direction. Urquart knew a few Fleet Street journalistswho had taken a vague interest in the occult and supernatural; he would contactthem and hint at a big story.When I returned to my hotel late that night, I felt happier than for many days.And I slept deeply and heavily. When I woke up, it was already long pastbreakfast time, and I felt exhausted. I attributed this to my long sleep, untilI tried to walk to the bathroom and found that my head throbbed as if I hadpicked up a flu germ. I took two aspirins, had a shave, then went downstairs. Tomy relief, no one else showed signs of a similar exhaustion. Coffee and butteredtoast in the lounge refreshed me slightly; I decided that I was suffering fromordinary strain. Then I rang Urquart.Mrs Dolgelly said, “I’m afraid he’s not up yet, sir. He’s not feeling too wellthis morning.”“What’s the matter with him?”“Nothing much. He just seems very tired.”“I’ll be right over,” I said. I told the desk to ring me a taxi; I was far tootired to walk.Twenty minutes later, I was sitting at Urquart’s bedside. He looked and felteven worse than I did.“I hate to suggest this,” I said, “feeling as we both do, but I think we’dbetter get out of this place as soon as possible.”“Couldn’t we wait until tomorrow?” he asked.“It will be worse tomorrow. They’ll exhaust us until we die of the first minorillness we pick up.”“I suppose you’re right.”Although it all seemed too troublesome for words, I managed to get back to thehotel, pack my bags, and order a taxi to the station in Cardiff, where we couldcatch a London train at three o’clock. Urquart encountered more difficulty thanI did; Mrs. Dolgelly showed unexpected strength of mind and refused to pack acase for him. He rang me, and I dragged myself back there again, wanting nothingso much as to climb back into bed. But the effort revived me; before midday, theheadache had vanished, and I was feeling less exhausted, although oddlylight-headed. Mrs. Dolgelly believed my explanation of an urgent telegram thatmade our journey a matter of life and death, although she was convinced thatUrquart would collapse on the way to London.That night, we slept in the Regent Palace Hotel. And in the morning, we bothwoke up feeling perfectly normal. It was Urquart who said, as we waited for ouregg and bacon at breakfast, “I think we’re winning, old boy.”But neither of us really believed it.And from this point on, my story ceases to be a continuous narrative, andbecomes a series of fragments, and a record of frustration. We spent weeks inthe British Museum searching for clues, and later in the Bibliothèque Nationale.Books on cults in the South Seas indicate that many traditions of the Lloigorsurvive there, and it is well known that they will one day return and reclaimtheir world. One text quoted by Leduc and Poitier says that they will cause a“tearing madness” to break out among those they wish to destroy, and theirfootnote says that “tearing,” as used in this context, means to tear with theteeth, like a man eating a chicken leg. Von Storch has records of a Haitiantribe in which the menfolk became possessed of a demon that led many of them tokill wives and children by tearing at their throats with their teeth.Lovecraft also provided us with an important hint. In “The Call of Cthulhu” hementions a collection of press cuttings, all of which reveal that the “entombedOld Ones” are becoming more active in the world. Later the same day, I happenedto meet a girl who worked for a press-cutting agency, who told me that her jobwas simply to read through dozens of newspapers every day, looking out formention of the names of clients. I asked her if she could look for items of“unusual” interest—anything hinting at the mysterious or supernatural—and shesaid she saw no reason why not. I gave her a copy of Charles Fort’s Lo! to giveher an idea of the kind of items I wanted.Two weeks later, a thin buff envelope arrived, with a dozen or so pressclippings in it. Most of them were unimportant—babies with two heads and similarmedical curiosities, a man killed in Scotland by an enormous hailstone, reportsof an abominable snowman seen on the slopes of Everest—but two or three weremore relevant to our search. We immediately contacted several more press-cuttingagencies in England, America, and Australia.The result was an enormous amount of material, which finally occupied twoenormous volumes. It was arranged under various headings: explosions, murders,witchcraft (and the supernatural in general), insanity, scientific observations,miscellaneous. The details of the explosion near Al-Kazimiyah in Iraq are sosimilar to those of the Llandalffen disaster—even to the exhaustion of theinhabitants of Al-Kazimiyah—that I have no doubt that this area is anotherstronghold of the Lloigor. The explosion that changed the course of the Tula Golnear Ulan Bator in Mongolia actually led the Chinese to accuse Russia ofdropping an atomic bomb. The strange insanity that destroyed ninety percent ofthe inhabitants of the southern island of Zaforas in the Sea of Crete is still amystery upon which the Greek military government refuses to comment. Themassacre at Panagyurishte in Bulgaria on the night of March 29th, 1968, wasblamed, in the first official reports, upon a “vampire cult” who “regarded thenebula in Andromeda as their true home.” These are some of the major events thatconvinced us that the Lloigor are planning a major attack on the inhabitants ofthe earth.But there were literally dozens—eventually hundreds—of less important items thatfitted the pattern. The marine creature that dragged away a trout fisherman inLoch Eilt led to several newspaper articles about “prehistoric survivals”; butthe Glasgow edition of the Daily Express (May 18, 1968) printed a story of awitch cult and their worship of a sea-devil with an overpowering smell of decaythat recalled Lovecraft’s Innsmouth. An item about the Melksham strangler led meto spend some days there, and I have a signed statement by Detective SergeantBradley agreeing that the words the killer used repeatedly before he died were“Ghatanothoa,” “Nug” (another elemental described in Lovecraft), and “Rantegoz.”(Rhan-Tegoth, the beast god, also mentioned in Lovecraft?) Robbins (thestrangler) claimed that he was possessed by a “power from underground” when hekilled the three women and amputated their feet.It would be pointless to continue this list. We hope to have a number ofselected items from it—some five hundred in all—published in a volume that willbe sent to every member of Congress and every member of the British House ofCommons.There are certain items that will not be published in this volume, and which areperhaps the most disturbing of all. At 7:45 on December 7th, 1967, a smallprivate aircraft piloted by R. D. Jones of Kingston, Jamaica, left FortLauderdale, Florida, for Kingston. There were three passengers aboard. Thejourney of about five hundred kilometres should have taken two hours. By teno’clock, Jones’s wife, waiting at the airfield, became alarmed and suggested asearch. All attempts at radio contact failed. The search began during themorning. At 1:15, Jones radioed the field for permission to land, apparentlyunaware of the anxiety he was causing. When asked where he had been, he lookedpuzzled, and said, “Flying, of course.” When told the time, he was amazed. Hisown watch showed 10:15. He said he had been flying in low cloud most of the way,but that he had no cause for alarm. Weather reports showed that it was anexceptionally clear day for December, and that he should have encountered nocloud. (Gleaner, Dec. 8th, 1967.)The other four cases of which we possess details are similar to this first one,except that one case, the Jeannie, concerned a coast guard vessel off the westcoast of Scotland, not an aeroplane. In this instance, the three men on boardhad encountered heavy “fog,” discovered their radio was not working, and that,for some reason, their watches had stopped. They assumed that it was some oddmagnetic disturbance. However, the vessel’s other instruments worked wellenough, and in due course, the boat reached Stornoway on Lewis—having beenmissing for twenty-two hours instead of the three or four assumed by the crew.The naval training plane Blackjack, off the Baja peninsula, Southern California,holds the record; it was missing for three days and five hours. The crew thoughtit had been away from base for seven hours or so.We have been unable to discover what explanation was advanced by the navy forthis curious episode, or by the coast guard of Great Britain for the Jeannieinterlude. It was probably assumed that the crew got drunk at sea and fellasleep. But there is one thing we soon learned beyond all doubt: human beings donot wish to know about things that threaten their feeling of security and“normality.” This was also a discovery made by the late Charles Fort; he devotedhis life to analysing it. And I suppose the books of Fort present classicinstances of what William James called “a certain blindness in human beings.”For he invariably gives newspaper references for the incredible events he cites.Why had no one ever taken the trouble to check his references—or some ofthem—and then write a statement admitting his honesty or denouncing him as afraud? Mr. Tiffany Thayer once told me that critical readers take the view thatthere was some “special circumstance” in each case Fort quotes which invalidatesit—an unreliable witness here, an inventive reporter there, and so on. And itnever strikes anyone that to use this explanation to cover a thousand pages fullof carefully assembled facts amounts to pure self-delusion.Like most people, I have always made the assumption that my fellow human beingsare relatively honest, relatively open-minded, relatively curious. If anythingwere needed to reassure me about the curiosity about the apparentlyinexplicable, I would only have to glance at any airport bookstall, with itsdozen or so paperbacks by Frank Edwards, et al., all bearing titles like Worldof the Weird, A Hundred Events Stranger than Fiction, and so on. It comes as ashock to discover that all this is not proof of a genuine open-mindedness aboutthe “supernatural” but only of a desire to be titillated and shocked. Thesebooks are a kind of occult pornography, part of a game of “let’s make believethe world is far less dull than it actually is.”On August 19th, 1968, Urquart and myself invited twelve “friends” to the roomswe had taken at 83 Gower Street—the house in which Darwin lived immediatelyafter his marriage. We felt the Darwin association was appropriate, for we hadno doubt that the date would long be remembered by everyone present. I shall notgo into detail except to say that there were four professors—three from London,one from Cambridge—two journalists, both from respectable newspapers, andseveral members of the professions, including a doctor.Urquart introduced me, and I read from a prepared statement, elaborating where Ifelt it to be necessary. After ten minutes, the Cambridge professor cleared histhroat, said “Excuse me,” and hurried out of the room. I discovered later thathe thought he had been the victim of a practical joke. The others listened tothe end, and for a great deal of the time, I was aware that they were alsowondering whether this was all a joke. When they realised that it was not, theybecame definitely hostile. One of the journalists, a young man just down fromthe university, kept interrupting with: “Are we to understand.…” One of theladies got up and left, although I heard later that this was less from disbeliefthan because she suddenly noticed that there were now thirteen people in theroom and thought it unlucky. The young journalist was carrying two of Urquart’sbooks on Mu, and he quoted from these with deadly effect. Urquart is certainlyno master of the English language, and there was a time when I would have seenin them mainly an excuse for witty sarcasm.But what was amazing to me was that no one present seemed to accept our“lecture” as a warning. They argued about it as though it were an interestingtheory, or perhaps an unusual short story. Finally, after an hour of quibblingabout various newspaper cuttings, a solicitor stood up and made a speech thatobviously conveyed the general feeling, beginning: “I think Mr. Hough (thejournalist) has expressed the misgivings we all feel.…” His main point, which hekept repeating, was that there was no definite evidence. The Llandalffenexplosion could have been due to nitroglycerine or even the impact of a showerof meteors. Poor Urquart’s books were treated in a manner that would have mademe wince even in my most sceptical days.There was no point in going on. We tape-recorded the whole meeting, and had ittyped and duplicated, hoping that one day it will be regarded as almostunbelievable evidence of human blindness and stupidity. And then nothing morehappened. The two newspapers decided not to print even a critical account of ourarguments. A number of people got wind of the meeting and came to see us—bosomyladies with ouija boards, a thin man who thought the Loch Ness monster was aRussian submarine, and a number of assorted cranks. This was the point where wedecided to move to America. We still entertained some absurd hope that Americanswould prove more open-minded than the English.It did not take long to disillusion us—although it is true that we found one ortwo people who were at least willing to suspend judgment on our sanity. But onthe whole, the results were negative. We spent an interesting day at the almostdefunct fishing village of Cohasset—Lovecraft’s Innsmouth; long enough todiscover that it is as active a centre of Lloigor activity as Llandalffen,perhaps more so, and that we would be in extreme danger if we remained there.But we managed to locate Joseph Cullen Marsh, grandson of Lovecraft’s CaptainMarsh, who now lived in Popasquash. He told us that his grandfather had diedinsane, and believed that he had possessed certain “occult” books andmanuscripts, which had been destroyed by his widow. This may have been whereLovecraft actually saw the Necronomicon. He also mentioned that Captain Marshreferred to the ancient Old Ones as “the Masters of Time”—an interesting commentin view of the case of the Jeannie, the Blackjack, and the rest.Urquart is convinced that the manuscripts were not destroyed—on the curiousgrounds that such ancient works have a character of their own, and tend to avoiddestruction. He is conducting an enormous correspondence with Captain Marsh’sheirs, and his family solicitors, in an attempt to pick up the trail of theNecronomicon.In the present stage …Editor’s Note. The above words were written by my uncle a few minutes before hereceived the telegram from Senator James R. Pinckney of Virginia, an oldschool-friend, and probably one of those my uncle mentions as being “willing tosuspend judgment on his sanity.” The telegram read: COME TO WASHINGTON AS SOONAS POSSIBLE, BRING CUTTINGS, CONTACT ME AT MY HOME, PINCKNEY. Senator Pinckneyhas confirmed to me that the Secretary for Defense had agreed to spend some timewith my uncle, and that, if impressed, he might conceivably have arranged aninterview with the President himself.My uncle and Colonel Urquart were unable to get on the three-fifteen flight fromCharlottesville to Washington; they went to the airport on a “stand-by” basis,hoping for cancellations. There was only one cancellation, and after someargument, Colonel Urquart agreed with my uncle that they should stick togetherrather than go to Washington by different routes. At this point, Captain HarveyNichols agreed to fly them to Washington in a Cessna 311 of which he wasone-quarter owner.The plane took off from a side runway at 3:43 on February 19, 1969; the sky wasperfectly clear, and weather reports were excellent. Ten minutes later, theairfield received the mystifying signal “running into low cloud.” He should havebeen by then somewhere in the area of Gordonsville, and the weather over thisarea was exceptionally clear. Subsequent attempts to contact the plane by radiofailed. At five o’clock, I was informed that radio contact had been lost. Butduring the next few hours, hope revived as widespread enquiries failed todiscover any reports of a crash. By midnight, we all assumed that it would onlybe a matter of time before the wreck was reported.It has never been reported. In the two months that have elapsed since then,nothing further has been heard of my uncle or of the plane. It is my ownopinion—supported by many people of wide experience in flying—that the plane hadan instrument failure, and somehow flew out over the Atlantic, where it crashed.My uncle had already arranged for the publication of this book of selectionsfrom his press-cutting albums with the Black Cockerell Press of Charlottesville,and it seems appropriate that these notes of his should be used as anintroduction.In the newspaper stories that have appeared about my uncle in the past twomonths, it has often been assumed that he was insane, or at least, sufferingfrom delusions. This is not my own view. I met Colonel Urquart on a great manyoccasions, and it is my own opinion that he was thoroughly untrustworthy. Mymother described him to me as “an extremely shifty character.” Even my uncle’saccount of him—at their first meeting—bears this out. It would be charitable toassume that Urquart believed everything he wrote in his books, but I find thishard to accept. They are cheap and sensational, and in parts obviously pureinvention. (For example, he never mentions the name of the Hindu monastery—oreven its location—where he made his amazing “finds” about Mu; neither does hemention the name of the priest who is supposed to have taught him to read thelanguage of the inscriptions.)My uncle was a simple and easy-going man, almost a caricature of theabsent-minded professor. This is revealed in his naive account of the meeting at83 Gower Street, and the reaction of his audience. He had no notion of thepossibilities of human duplicity that are, in my opinion, revealed in thewritings of Colonel Urquart. And typically, my uncle does not mention that itwas he who paid for the Colonel’s passage across the Atlantic, and for the roomsat 83 Gower Street. The Colonel’s income was extremely small, while my unclewas, I suppose, comparatively well-off.And yet there is, I think, another possibility that must be taken intoaccount—suggested by my uncle’s friend Foster Damon. My uncle was loved by hisstudents and colleagues for his sense of dry humour, and has been many timescompared to Mark Twain. And the resemblance did not end there; he also sharedTwain’s deep vein of pessimism about the human race.I knew my uncle well in the last years of his life, and saw much of him even inthe last months. He knew I did not believe his stories about the “Lloigor,” andthat I thought Urquart a charlatan. A fanatic would have tried to convince me,and perhaps refused to speak to me when I declined to be convinced. My unclecontinued to treat me with the same good humour as ever, and my mother and Iboth noticed that his eyes often twinkled as he looked at me. Was hecongratulating himself on having a nephew who was too pragmatic to be taken inby his elaborate joke?I like to think so. For he was a good and sincere man, and is mourned byinnumerable friends.—Julian F.

Enjoy the cream cheese and bagel. I guarantee this one will make afirst-class TV movie; I’m working on it already. Small cast, cheapproduction—it’s a natural. See, we start with this crazy chick, maybe aboutseventeen, but she’s a waif, she’s withdrawn from the world, see? She’s had somekind of terrible shock. And she’s fixed up this old apartment in a slum, reallyweird, like a fantasy world—long blonde hair, maybe goes around barefoot intie-dyed dresses she makes out of old sheets, and there’s this account executivewho meets her in Central Park and falls in love with her on account of she’slike a dryad or a nature spirit—All right. So it stinks. I’ll pay for my lunch. We’ll pretend you’re not myagent, okay? And you don’t have to tell me it’s been done; I know it’s beendone. The truth is—Milty, I have to talk to someone. No, it’s a lousy idea, I know, and I’m notworking on it and I haven’t been working on it, but what are you going to doMemorial Day weekend if you’re alone and everybody’s out of town?I have to talk to someone.Yes, I’ll get off the Yiddische shtick. Hell, I don’t think about it; I justfall into it sometimes when I get upset, you know how it is. You do it yourself.But I want to tell you a story and it’s not a story for a script. It’s somethingthat happened to me in high school in 1952, and I just want to tell someone. Idon’t care if no station from here to Indonesia can use it; you just tell mewhether I’m nuts or not, that’s all.Okay.It was 1952, like I said. I was a senior in a high school out on the Island, apublic high school but very fancy, a big drama program. They were just beginningto integrate, you know, the early fifties, very liberal neighborhood;everybody’s patting everybody else on the back because they let five black kidsinto our school. Five out of eight hundred! You’d think they expected God tocome down from Flatbush and give everybody a big fat golden halo.Anyway, our drama class got integrated, too—one little black girl aged fifteennamed Cissie Jackson, some kind of genius. All I remember the first day of thespring term, she was the only black I’d ever seen with a natural, only we didn’tknow what the hell it was, then; it made her look as weird as if she’d just comeout of a hospital or something.Which, by the way, she just had. You know Malcolm X saw his father killed bywhite men when he was four and that made him a militant for life? Well, Cissie’sfather had been shot down in front of her eyes when she was a little kid—welearned that later on—only it didn’t make her militant; it just made her soscared of everybody and everything that she’d withdraw into herself and wouldn’tspeak to anybody for weeks on end. Sometimes she’d withdraw right out of thisworld and then they’d send her to the loony bin; believe me, it was all overschool in two days. And she looked it; she’d sit up there in the schooltheater—oh, Milty, the Island high schools had money, you better believe it!—andtry to disappear into the last seat like some little scared rabbit. She was onlyfour-eleven anyhow, and maybe eighty-five pounds sopping wet. So maybe that’swhy she didn’t become a militant. Hell, that had nothing to do with it. She wasscared of everybody. It wasn’t just the white-black thing, either; I once sawher in a corner with one of the other black students: real uptight, respectableboy, you know, suit and white shirt and tie and carrying a new briefcase, too,and he was talking to her about something as if his life depended on it. He wasactually crying and pleading with her. And all she did was shrink back into thecorner as if she’d like to disappear and shake her head No No No. She alwaystalked in a whisper unless she was onstage and sometimes then, too. The firstweek she forgot her cues four times—just stood there, glazed over, ready to fallthrough the floor—and a couple of times she just wandered off the set as if theplay was over, right in the middle of a scene.So Al Coppolino and I went to the principal. I’d always thought Alan was prettymuch a fruitcake himself—remember, Milty, this is 1952—because he used to readall that crazy stuff, The Cult of Cthulhu, Dagon Calls, The Horror Men of Leng—yeah, I remember that H. P. Lovecraft flick you got ten percent on for Hollywoodand TV and reruns—but what did we know? Those days you went to parties, you gotexcited from dancing cheek to cheek, girls wore ankle socks and petticoats tostick their skirts out, and if you wore a sport shirt to school that was okaybecause Central High was liberal, but it better not have a pattern on it. Evenso, I knew Al was a bright kid and I let him do most of the talking; I justnodded a lot. I was a big nothing in those days.Al said, “Sir, Jim and I are all for integration and we think it’s great thatthis is a really liberal place, but—uh—”The principal got that look. Uh-oh.“But?” he said, cold as ice.“Well, sir,” said Al, “it’s Cissie Jackson. We think she’s—um—sick. I meanwouldn’t it be better if … I mean everybody says she’s just come out of thehospital and it’s a strain for all of us and it must be a lot worse strain forher and maybe it’s just a little soon for her to—”“Sir,” I said, “what Coppolino means is, we don’t mind integrating blacks withwhites, but this isn’t racial integration, sir; this is integrating normalpeople with a filbert. I mean—”He said, “Gentlemen, it might interest you to know that Miss Cecilia Jackson hashigher scores on her IQ tests than the two of you put together. And I am told bythe drama department that she has also more talent than the two of you puttogether. And considering the grades both of you have managed to achieve in thefall term, I’m not at all surprised.”Al said under his breath, “Yeah, and fifty times as many problems.”Well, the principal went on and told us about how we should welcome this chanceto work with her because she was so brilliant she was positively a genius, andthat as soon as we stopped spreading idiotic rumors, the better chance MissJackson would have to adjust to Central, and if he heard anything about ourbothering her again or spreading stories about her, both of us were going to getit but good, and maybe we would even be expelled.And then his voice lost the ice, and he told us about some white cop shootingher pa for no reason at all when she was five, right in front of her, and her pableeding into the gutter and dying in little Cissie’s lap, and how poor hermother was, and a couple of other awful things that had happened to her, and ifthat wasn’t enough to drive anybody crazy—though he said, “cause problems,” youknow—anyhow, by the time he’d finished, I felt like a rat and Coppolino wentoutside the principal’s office, put his face down against the tiles—they alwayshad tiles up as high as you could reach, so they could wash off the graffiti,though we didn’t use the word “graffiti” in those days—and he blubbered like ababy.So we started a Help Cecilia Jackson campaign.And by God, Milty, could that girl act! She wasn’t reliable, that was thetrouble; one week she’d be in there, working like a dog, voice exercises, gym,fencing, reading Stanislavsky in the cafeteria, gorgeous performances, the nextweek: nothing. Oh, she was there in the flesh, all right, all eighty-five poundsof her, but she would walk through everything as if her mind was someplace else:technically perfect, emotionally nowhere. I heard later those were also thetimes when she’d refuse to answer questions in history or geography classes,just fade out and not talk. But when she was concentrating, she could walk ontothat stage and take it over as if she owned it. I never saw such a natural. Atfifteen! And tiny. I mean not a particularly good voice—though I guess justgetting older would’ve helped that—and a figure that, frankly, Milt, it was theold W. C. Fields joke, two aspirins on an ironing board. And tiny, no real goodlooks, but my God, you know and I know that doesn’t matter if you’ve got thepresence. And she had it to burn. She played the Queen of Sheba once, in aone-act play we put on before a live audience—all right, our parents and theother kids, who else?—and she was the role. And another time I saw her do thingsfrom Shakespeare. And once, of all things, a lioness in a mime class. She had itall. Real, absolute, pure concentration. And she was smart, too; by then she andAl had become pretty good friends; I once heard her explain to him (that was inthe green room the afternoon of the Queen of Sheba thing when she was taking offher makeup with cold cream) just how she’d figured out each bit of business forthe character. Then she stuck her whole arm out at me, pointing straight at meas if her arm was a machine gun, and said:“For you, Mister Jim, let me tell you: the main thing is belief!”It was a funny thing, Milt. She got better and better friends with Al, and whenthey let me tag along, I felt privileged. He loaned her some of those crazybooks of his and I overheard things about her life, bits and pieces. That girlhad a mother who was so uptight and so God-fearing and so respectable it was awonder Cissie could even breathe without asking permission. Her mother wouldn’teven let her straighten her hair—not ideological reasons, you understand, notthen, but because—get this—Cissie was too young. I think her mamma must’ve beencrazier than she was. Course I was a damn stupid kid (who wasn’t?) and I reallythought all blacks were real loose; they went around snapping their fingers andhanging from chandeliers, you know, all that stuff, dancing and singing. Buthere was this genius from a family where they wouldn’t let her out at night; shewasn’t allowed to go to parties or dance or play cards; she couldn’t wear makeupor even jewelry. Believe me, I think if anything drove her batty it was beingsocked over the head so often with a Bible. I guess her imagination just had tofind some way out. Her mother, by the way, would’ve dragged her out of CentralHigh by the hair if she’d found out about the drama classes; we all had to swearto keep that strictly on the q.t. The theater was more sinful and wicked thandancing, I guess.You know, I think it shocked me. It really did. Al’s family wassort-of-nothing-really Catholic and mine was sort-of-nothing Jewish. I’d nevermet anybody with a mamma like that. I mean she would’ve beaten Cissie up ifCissie had ever come home with a gold circle pin on that white blouse she woreday in and day out; you remember the kind all the girls wore. And of coursethere were no horsehair petticoats for Miss Jackson; Miss Jackson wore pleatedskirts that were much too short, even for her, and straight skirts that lookedfaded and all bunched up. For a while I had some vague idea that the shortskirts meant she was daring, you know, sexy, but it wasn’t that; they were froma much younger cousin, let down. She just couldn’t afford her own clothes. Ithink it was the mamma and the Bible business that finally made me stop seeingCissie as the Integration Prize Nut we had to be nice to because of theprincipal or the scared little rabbit who still, by the way, whisperedeveryplace but in drama class. I just saw Cecilia Jackson plain, I guess, notthat it lasted for more than a few minutes, but I knew she was somethingspecial. So one day in the hall, going from one class to another, I met her andAl and I said, “Cissie, your name is going to be up there in lights someday. Ithink you’re the best actress I ever met and I just want to say it’s a privilegeknowing you.” And then I swept her a big corny bow, like Errol Flynn.She looked at Al and Al looked at her, sort of sly. Then she let down her headover her books and giggled. She was so tiny you sometimes wondered how she coulddrag those books around all day; they hunched her over so.Al said, “Aw, come on. Let’s tell him.”So they told me their big secret. Cissie had a girl cousin named Gloriette, andGloriette and Cissie together owned an honest-to-God slip for a boat in themarina out in Silverhampton. Each of them paid half the slip fee—which was abouttwo bucks a month then, Milt—you have to remember that a marina then just meanta long wooden dock you could tie your rowboat up to.“Gloriette’s away,” said Cissie, in that whisper. “She had to go visit auntie,in Carolina. And mamma’s goin’ to follow her next week on Sunday.”“So we’re going to go out in the boat!” Al finished it for her. “You wannacome?”“Sunday?”“Sure, mamma will go to the bus station after church,” said Cissie. “That’sabout one o’clock. Aunt Evelyn comes to take care of me at nine. So we haveeight hours.”“And it takes two hours to get there,” said Al. “First you take the subway; thenyou take a bus—”“Unless we use your car, Jim!” said Cissie, laughing so hard she dropped herbooks.“Well, thanks very much!” I said. She scooped them up again and smiled at me.“No, Jim,” she said. “We want you to come, anyway. Al never saw the boat yet.Gloriette and me, we call it My Boat.” Fifteen years old and she knew how tosmile at you so’s to twist your heart like a pretzel. Or maybe I just thought:what a wicked secret to have! A big sin, I guess, according to her family.I said, “Sure, I’ll drive you. May I ask what kind of boat it is, Miss Jackson?”“Don’t be so damn’ silly,” she said daringly. “I’m Cissie or Cecilia. Silly Jim.“And as for My Boat,” she added, “it’s a big yacht. Enormous.”I was going to laugh at that, but then I saw she meant it. No, she was justplaying. She was smiling wickedly at me again. She said we should meet at thebus stop near her house, and then she went down the tiled hall next to skinnylittle Al Coppolino, in her old baggy green skirt and her always-the-same whiteblouse. No beautiful, big white sloppy bobby socks for Miss Jackson; she justwore old loafers coming apart at the seams. She looked different, though: herhead was up, her step springy, and she hadn’t been whispering.And then it occurred to me it was the first time I had ever seen her smile orlaugh—offstage. Mind you, she cried easily enough, like the time in class sherealized from something the teacher had said that Anton Chekhov—you know, thegreat Russian playwright—was dead. I heard her telling Alan later that shedidn’t believe it. There were lots of little crazy things like that.Well, I picked her up Sunday in what was probably the oldest car in the world,even then—not a museum piece, Milty, it’d still be a mess—frankly I was lucky toget it started at all—and when I got to the bus station near Cissie’s house inBrooklyn, there she was in her faded, hand-me-down, pleated skirt and that sameblouse. I guess little elves named Cecilia Jackson came out of the woodworkevery night and washed and ironed it. Funny, she and Al really did make apair—you know, he was like the Woody Allen of Central High and I think he wentin for his crazy books—sure, Milt, very crazy in 1952—because otherwise whatcould a little Italian punk do who was five foot three and so brilliant no otherkid could understand half the time what he was talking about? I don’t know why Iwas friends with him; I think it made me feel big, you know, generous and good,like being friends with Cissie. They were almost the same size, waiting there bythe bus stop, and I think their heads were in the same place. I know it now. Iguess he was just a couple of decades ahead of himself, like his books. Andmaybe if the civil rights movement had started a few years earlier—Anyway, we drove out to Silverhampton and it was a nice drive, lots of country,though all flat—in those days there were still truck farms on the Island—andfound the marina, which was nothing more than a big old quay, but sound enough;and I parked the car and Al took out a shopping bag Cissie’d been carrying.“Lunch,” he said.My Boat was there, all right, halfway down the dock. Somehow I hadn’t expectedit would exist, even. It was an old leaky wooden row-boat with only one oar, andthere were three inches of bilge in the bottom. On the bow somebody had paintedthe name “My Boat” shakily in orange paint. My Boat was tied to the mooring by arope about as sturdy as a piece of string. Still, it didn’t look like it wouldsink right away; after all, it’d been sitting there for months, getting rainedon, maybe even snowed on, and it was still floating. So I stepped down into it,wishing I’d had the sense to take off my shoes, and started bailing with a tincan I’d brought from the car. Alan and Cissie were taking things out of the bagin the middle of the boat. I guess they were setting out lunch. It was prettyclear that My Boat spent most of its time sitting at the dock while Cissie andGloriette ate lunch and maybe pretended they were on the Queen Mary, becauseneither Alan nor Cissie seemed to notice the missing oar. It was a nice day butin-and-outish, you know, clouds one minute, sun the next, but little fluffyclouds, no sign of rain. I bailed a lot of the gunk out and then moved up intothe bow, and as the sun came out I saw that I’d been wrong about the orangepaint. It was yellow.Then I looked closer: it wasn’t paint but something set into the side of My Boatlike the names on people’s office doors; I guess I must’ve not looked tooclosely the first time. It was a nice, flowing script, a real professional job.Brass, I guess. Not a plate, Milt, kind of—what do they call it, parquet?Intaglio? Each letter was put in separately. Must’ve been Alan; he had a talentfor stuff like that, used to make weird illustrations for his crazy books. Iturned around to find Al and Cissie taking a big piece of cheesecloth out of theshopping bag and draping it over high poles that were built into the sides ofthe boat. They were making a kind of awning. I said:“Hey, I bet you took that from the theater shop!”She just smiled.Al said, “Would you get us some fresh water, Jim?”“Sure,” I said. “Where, up the dock?”“No, from the bucket. Back in the stern. Cissie says it’s marked.”Oh, sure, I thought, sure. Out in the middle of the Pacific we set out ourbucket and pray for rain. There was a pail there all right, and somebody hadlaboriously stenciled “Fresh Water” on it in green paint, sort of smudgy, butthat pail was never going to hold anything ever again. It was bone-dry, empty,and so badly rusted that when you held it up to the light, you could see throughthe bottom in a couple of places. I said, “Cissie, it’s empty.”She said, “Look again, Jim.”I said, “But look, Cissie—” and turned the bucket upside-down.Cold water drenched me from my knees to the soles of my shoes.“See?” she said. “Never empty.” I thought: Hell, I didn’t look, that’s all.Maybe it rained yesterday. Still, a full pail of water is heavy and I had liftedthat thing with one finger. I set it down—if it had been full before, itcertainly wasn’t now—and looked again.It was full, right to the brim. I dipped my hand into the stuff and drank alittle of it: cold and clear as spring water and it smelled—I don’t know—offerns warmed by the sun, of raspberries, of field flowers, of grass. I thought:my God, I’m becoming a filbert myself! And then I turned around and saw thatAlan and Cissie had replaced the cheesecloth on the poles with a stripedblue-and-white awning, the kind you see in movies about Cleopatra, you know? Thestuff they put over her barge to keep the sun off. And Cissie had taken out ofher shopping bag something patterned orange-and-green-and-blue and had wrappedit around her old clothes. She had on gold-colored earrings, big hoop things,and a black turban over that funny hair. And she must’ve put her loaferssomewhere because she was barefoot. Then I saw that she had one shoulder bare,too, and I sat down on one of the marble benches of My Boat under the awningbecause I was probably having hallucinations. I mean she hadn’t had time—andwhere were her old clothes? I thought to myself that they must’ve lifted a wholebagful of stuff from the theater shop, like that big old wicked-looking knifeshe had stuck into her amber-studded leather belt, the hilt all covered withgold and stones: red ones, green ones, and blue ones with little crosses oflight winking in them that you couldn’t really follow with your eyes. I didn’tknow what the blue ones were then, but I know now. You don’t make star sapphiresin a theater shop. Or a ten-inch crescent-shaped steel blade so sharp the sundazzles you coming off its edge.I said, “Cissie, you look like the Queen of Sheba.”She smiled. She said to me, “Jim, iss not Shee-bah as in thee Bible, but Saba.Sah-bah. You mus’ remember when we meet her.”I thought to myself: Yeah, this is where little old girl genius Cissie Jacksoncomes to freak out every Sunday. Lost weekend. I figured this was the perfecttime to get away, make some excuse, you know, and call her mamma or her auntie,or maybe just the nearest hospital. I mean just for her own sake; Cissiewouldn’t hurt anybody because she wasn’t mean, not ever. And anyhow she was toolittle to hurt anyone. I stood up.Her eyes were level with mine. And she was standing below me.Al said, “Be careful, Jim. Look again. Always look again.” I went back to thestern. There was the bucket that said “Fresh Water,” but as I looked the suncame out and I saw I’d been mistaken; it wasn’t old rusty galvanized iron withsplotchy, green-painted letters.It was silver, pure silver. It was sitting in a sort of marble well built intothe stern, and the letters were jade inlay. It was still full. It would alwaysbe full. I looked back at Cissie standing under the blue-and-white-striped silkawning with her star sapphires and emeralds and rubies in her dagger and herfunny talk—I know it now, Milt, it was West Indian, but I didn’t then—and I knewas sure as if I’d seen it that if I looked at the letters “My Boat” in the sun,they wouldn’t be brass but pure gold. And the wood would be ebony. I wasn’t evensurprised. Although everything had changed, you understand, I’d never seen itchange; it was either that I hadn’t looked carefully the first time, or I’d madea mistake, or I hadn’t noticed something, or I’d just forgotten. Like what Ithought had been an old crate in the middle of My Boat, which was really theroof of a cabin with little portholes in it, and looking in I saw three bunkbeds below, a closet, and a beautiful little galley with a refrigerator and astove, and off to one side in the sink, where I couldn’t really see it clearly,a bottle with a napkin around its neck, sticking up from an ice bucket full ofcrushed ice, just like an old Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers movie. And the wholeinside of the cabin was paneled in teakwood.Cissie said, “No, Jim. Is not teak. Is cedar, from Lebanon. You see now why Icannot take seriously in this school this nonsense about places and where theyare and what happen in them. Crude oil in Lebanon! It is cedar they have. Andivory. I have been there many, many time. I have talk’ with the wise Solomon. Ihave been at court of Queen of Saba and have made eternal treaty with theKnossos women, the people of the double ax which is waxing and waning moontogether. I have visit Akhnaton and Nofretari, and have seen great kings atBenin and at Dar. I even go to Atlantis, where the Royal Couple teach me manythings. The priest and priestess, they show me how to make My Boat go anywhere Ilike, even under the sea. Oh, we have many improvin’ chats upon roof of Pahlahssat dusk!”It was real. It was all real. She was not fifteen, Milt. She sat in the bow atthe controls of My Boat, and there were as many dials and toggles and buttonsand switches and gauges on that thing as on a B-57. And she was at least tenyears older. Al Coppolino, too, he looked like a picture I’d seen in a historybook of Sir Francis Drake, and he had long hair and a little pointy beard. Hewas dressed like Drake, except for the ruff, with rubies in his ears and ringsall over his fingers, and he, too, was no seventeen-year-old. He had a faintscar running from his left temple at the hairline down past his eye to hischeekbone. I could also see that under her turban Cissie’s hair was braided insome very fancy way. I’ve seen it since. Oh, long before everybody was doing“corn rows.” I saw it at the Metropolitan Museum, in silver face-mask sculpturesfrom the city of Benin, in Africa. Old, Milt, centuries old.Al said, “I know of other places, Princess. I can show them to you. Oh, let usgo to Ooth-Nargai and Celephaïs the Fair, and Kadath in the Cold Waste—it’s afearful place, Jim, but we need not be afraid—and then we will go to the city ofUlthar, where is the very fortunate and lovely law that no man or woman may killor annoy a cat.”“The Atlanteans,” said Cissie in a deep, sweet voice, “they promise’ that nexttime they show me not jus’ how to go undersea. They say if you think hard, ifyou fix much, if you believe, then can make My Boat go straight up. Into thestars, Jim!”Al Coppolino was chanting names under his breath: Cathuria, Sona-Nyl, Thalarion,Zar, Baharna, Nir, Oriab. All out of those books of his.Cissie said, “Before you come with us, you must do one last thing, Jim. Untiethe rope.”So I climbed down My Boat’s ladder onto the quay and undid the braided gold ropethat was fastened to the slip. Gold and silk intertwined, Milt; it rippledthrough my hand as if it were alive; I know the hard, slippery feel of silk. Iwas thinking of Atlantis and Celephaïs and going up into the stars, and all ofit was mixed up in my head with the senior prom and college, because I had beenlucky enough to be accepted by The-College-Of-My-Choice, and what a future I’dhave as a lawyer, a corporation lawyer, after being a big gridiron star, ofcourse. Those were my plans in the old days. Dead certainties every one, right?Versus a thirty-five-foot yacht that would’ve made John D. Rockefeller turngreen with envy and places in the world where nobody’d ever been and nobody’dever go again. Cissie and Al stood on deck above me, the both of them lookinglike something out of a movie—beautiful and dangerous and very strange—andsuddenly I knew I didn’t want to go. Part of it was the absolute certainty thatif I ever offended Cissie in any way—I don’t mean just a quarrel or disagreementor something you’d get the sulks about, but a real bone-deep kind of offense—I’dsuddenly find myself in a leaky rowboat with only one oar in the middle of thePacific Ocean. Or maybe just tied up at the dock at Silverhampton; Cissie wasn’tmean. At least I hoped so. I just—I guess I didn’t feel good enough to go. Andthere was something about their faces, too, as if over both of them, butespecially over Cissie’s, like clouds, like veils, there swam other faces, otherexpressions, other souls, other pasts and futures, and other kinds of knowledge,all of them shifting like a heat mirage over an asphalt road on a hot day.I didn’t want that knowledge, Milt. I didn’t want to go that deep. It was thekind of thing most seventeen-year-olds don’t learn for years: Beauty. Despair.Mortality. Compassion. Pain.And I was still looking up at them, watching the breeze fill out Al Coppolino’splum-colored velvet cloak and shine on his silver-and-black doublet, when a big,heavy, hard, fat hand clamped down on my shoulder and a big, fat, nasty, heavySouthern voice said:“Hey, boy, you got no permit for this slip! What’s that rowboat doin’ out there?And what’s yo’ name?”So I turned and found myself looking into the face of the great-granddaddy ofall Southern red-neck sheriffs: face like a bulldog with jowls to match, andsunburnt red, and fat as a pig, and mountain-mean. I said, “Sir?”—everyhigh-school kid could say that in his sleep in those days—and then we turnedtowards the bay, me saying, “What boat, sir?” and the cop saying just, “Whatthe—”Because there was nothing there. My Boat was gone. There was only a blueshimmering stretch of bay. They weren’t out farther and they weren’t around theother side of the dock—the cop and I both ran around—and by the time I hadpresence of mind enough to look up at the sky—Nothing. A seagull. A cloud. A plane out of Idlewild. Besides, hadn’t Cissiesaid she didn’t yet know how to go straight up into the stars?No, nobody ever saw My Boat again. Or Miss Cecilia Jackson, complete nut andgirl genius, either. Her mamma came to school and I was called into theprincipal’s office. I told them a cooked-up story, the one I’d been going totell the cop: that they’d said they were just going to row around the dock andcome back, and I’d left to see if the car was okay in the parking lot, and whenI came back, they were gone. For some crazy reason I still thought Cissie’smamma would look like Aunt Jemima, but she was a thin little woman, very likeher daughter, and as nervous and uptight as I ever saw: a tiny lady in amuch-pressed, but very clean, gray business suit, like a teacher’s, you know,worn-out shoes, a blouse with a white frill at the neck, a straw hat with awhite band, and proper white gloves. I think Cissie knew what I expected hermamma to be and what a damned fool I was, even considering your run-of-the-mill,seventeen-year-old white liberal racist, and that’s why she didn’t take mealong.The cop? He followed me to my car, and by the time I got there—I was sweatingand crazy scared—He was gone, too. Vanished.I think Cissie created him. Just for a joke.So Cissie never came back. And I couldn’t convince Mrs. Jackson that AlanCoppolino, boy rapist, hadn’t carried her daughter off to some lonely place andmurdered her. I tried and tried, but Mrs. Jackson would never believe me.It turned out there was no Cousin Gloriette.Alan? Oh, he came back. But it took him a while. A long, long while. I saw himyesterday, Milt, on the Brooklyn subway. A skinny, short guy with ears thatstuck out, still wearing the sport shirt and pants he’d started out in, thatSunday more than twenty years ago, and with the real 1950s haircut nobody wouldwear today. Quite a few people were staring at him, in fact.The thing is, Milt, he was still seventeen.No, I know it wasn’t some other kid. Because he was waving at me and smiling fitto beat the band. And when I got out with him at his old stop, he started askingafter everybody in Central High just as if it had been a week later, or maybeonly a day. Though when I asked him where the hell he’d been for twenty years,he wouldn’t tell me. He only said he’d forgotten something. So we went up fiveflights to his old apartment, the way we used to after school for a couple ofhours before his mom and dad came home from work. He had the old key in hispocket. And it was just the same, Milt: the gas refrigerator, the exposed pipesunder the sink, the summer slipcovers nobody uses anymore, the winter drapes putaway, the valance over the window muffled in a sheet, the bare parquet floors,and the old linoleum in the kitchen. Every time I’d ask him a question, he’donly smile. He knew me, though, because he called me by name a couple of times.I said, “How’d you recognize me?” and he said, “Recognize? You haven’t changed.”Haven’t changed, my God. Then I said, “Look, Alan, what did you come back for?”and with a grin just like Cissie’s, he said, “The Necronomicon by the mad Arab,Abdul Alhazred, what else?” but I saw the book he took with him and it was adifferent one. He was careful to get just the right one, looked through everyshelf in the bookcase in his bedroom. There were still college banners all overthe walls of his room. I know the book now, by the way; it was the one youwanted to make into a quick script last year for the guy who does the Poemovies, only I told you it was all special effects and animation: exoticislands, strange worlds, and the monsters’ costumes alone—sure, H. P. Lovecraft.The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. He didn’t say a word after that. Just walkeddown the five flights with me behind him and then along the old block to thenearest subway station, but of course by the time I reached the bottom of thesubway steps, he wasn’t there.His apartment? You’ll never find it. When I raced back up, even the house wasgone. More than that, Milt, the street is gone; the address doesn’t existanymore; it’s all part of the new expressway now.Which is why I called you. My God, I had to tell somebody! By now those twopsychiatric cases are voyaging around between the stars to Ulthar andOoth-Nargai and Dylath-Leen—But they’re not psychiatric cases. It really happened.So if they’re not psychiatric cases, what does that make you and me? Blind men?I’ll tell you something else, Milt: meeting Al reminded me of what Cissie oncesaid before the whole thing with My Boat but after we’d become friends enoughfor me to ask her what had brought her out of the hospital. I didn’t ask it likethat and she didn’t answer it like that, but what it boiled down to was thatsooner or later, at every place she visited, she’d meet a bleeding man withwounds in his hands and feet who would tell her, “Cissie, go back, you’reneeded; Cissie, go back, you’re needed.” I was fool enough to ask her if he wasa white man or a black man. She just glared at me and walked away. Now wounds inthe hands and feet, you don’t have to look far to tell what that means to aChristian Bible-raised girl. What I wonder is: will she meet Him again, outthere among the stars? If things get bad enough for black power or women’sliberation, or even for people who write crazy books, I don’t know what, will MyBoat materialize over Times Square or Harlem or East New York with an Ethiopianwarrior-queen in it and Sir Francis Drake Coppolino, and God-only-knows-whatkind of weapons from the lost science of Atlantis? I tell you, I wouldn’t besurprised. I really wouldn’t. I only hope He—or Cissie’s idea of Him—decidesthat things are still okay, and they can go on visiting all those places in AlCoppolino’s book. I tell you, I hope that book is a long book.Still, if I could do it again.…Milt, it is not a story. It happened. For instance, tell me one thing, how didshe know the name Nofretari? That’s the Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, that’s how weall learned it, but how could she know the real name decades, literally decades,before anybody else? And Saba? That’s real, too. And Benin? We didn’t have anycourses in African History in Central High, not in 1952! And what about thedouble-headed ax of the Cretans at Knossos? Sure, we read about Crete in highschool, but nothing in our history books ever told us about the matriarchy orthe labrys, that’s the name of the ax. Milt, I tell you, there is even a women’slib bookstore in Manhattan called—Have it your own way.Oh, sure. She wasn’t black; she was green. It’d make a great TV show. Green,blue, and rainbow-colored. I’m sorry, Milty, I know you’re my agent and you’vedone a lot of work for me and I haven’t sold much lately. I’ve been reading. No,nothing you’d like: existentialism, history, Marxism, some Eastern stuff—Sorry, Milt, but we writers do read every once in a while. It’s this little vicewe have. I’ve been trying to dig deep, like Al Coppolino, though maybe in adifferent way.Okay, so you want to have this Martian, who wants to invade Earth, so he turnshimself into a beautiful tanned girl with long, straight blonde hair, right? Andbecomes a high-school student in a rich school in Westchester. And thisbeautiful blonde girl Martian has to get into all the local organizations likethe women’s consciousness-raising groups and the encounter therapy stuff and thecheerleaders and the kids who push dope, so he—she, rather—can learn about theEarth mentality. Yeah. And of course she has to seduce the principal and thecoach and all the big men on campus, so we can make it into a series, even asitcom maybe; each week this Martian falls in love with an Earthman or she triesto do something to destroy Earth or blow up something, using Central High for abase. Can I use it? Sure I can! It’s beautiful. It’s right in my line. I canwork in everything I just told you. Cissie was right not to take me along; I’vegot spaghetti where my backbone should be.Nothing. I didn’t say anything. Sure. It’s a great idea. Even if we only get apilot out of it.No, Milt, honestly, I really think it has this fantastic spark. A real touch ofgenius. It’ll sell like crazy. Yeah, I can manage an idea sheet by Monday. Sure.“The Beautiful Menace from Mars”? Uh-huh. Absolutely. It’s got sex, it’s gotdanger, comedy, everything; we could branch out into the lives of the teachers,the principal, the other kids’ parents. Bring in contemporary problems like drugabuse. Sure. Another Peyton Place. I’ll even move to the West Coast again. Youare a genius.Oh, my God.Nothing. Keep on talking. It’s just—see that little skinny kid in the next boothdown? The one with the stuck-out ears and the old-fashioned haircut? You don’t?Well, I think you’re just not looking properly, Milt. Actually I don’t think Iwas, either; he must be one of the Met extras, you know, they come out sometimesduring the intermission: all that Elizabethan stuff, the plum-colored cloak, thecalf-high boots, the silver-and-black. As a matter of fact, I justremembered—the Met moved uptown a couple of years ago, so he couldn’t be dressedlike that, could he?You still can’t see him? I’m not surprised. The light’s very bad in here.Listen, he’s an old friend—I mean he’s the son of an old friend—I better go overand say hello, I won’t be a minute.Milt, this young man is important! I mean he’s connected with somebody veryimportant. Who? One of the biggest and best producers in the world, that’s who!He—uh—they—wanted me to—you might call it do a script for them, yeah. I didn’twant to at the time, but—No, no, you stay right here. I’ll just sort of lean over and say hello. You keepon talking about the Beautiful Menace from Mars; I can listen from there; I’lljust tell him they can have me if they want me.Your ten percent? Of course you’ll get your ten percent. You’re my agent, aren’tyou? Why, if it wasn’t for you, I just possibly might not have— Sure, you’ll getyour ten percent. Spend it on anything you like: ivory, apes, peacocks, spices,and Lebanese cedarwood!All you have to do is collect it.But keep on talking, Milty, won’t you? Somehow I want to go over to the nextbooth with the sound of your voice in my ears. Those beautiful ideas. Sooriginal. So creative. So true. Just what the public wants. Of course there’s adifference in the way people perceive things, and you and I, I think we perceivethem differently, you know? Which is why you are a respected, successful agentand I—well, let’s skip it. It wouldn’t be complimentary to either of us.Huh? Oh, nothing. I didn’t say anything. I’m listening. Over my shoulder. Justkeep on talking while I say hello and my deepest and most abject apologies, SirAlan Coppolino. Heard the name before, Milt? No? I’m not surprised.You just keep on talking.…* Originally published in Fantasy and Science Fiction, January 1976."},{"pageContent":"STICKS*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]KARL EDWARD WAGNER[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]IThe lashed-together framework of sticks jutted from a small cairn alongside thestream. Colin Leverett studied it in perplexment—half a dozen odd lengths ofbranch, wired together at cross angles for no fathomable purpose. It remindedhim unpleasantly of some bizarre crucifix, and he wondered what might liebeneath the cairn.It was the spring of 1942—the kind of day to make the War seem distant andunreal, although the draft notice waited on his desk. In a few days Leverettwould lock his rural studio, wonder if he would see it again—be able to use itspens and brushes and carving tools when he did return. It was goodby to thewoods and streams of upstate New York, too. No fly rods, no tramps through thecountryside in Hitler’s Europe. No point in putting off fishing that troutstream he had driven past once, exploring back roads of the Otselic Valley.Mann Brook—so it was marked on the old Geological Survey map—ran southeast ofDeRuyter. The unfrequented country road crossed over a stone bridge old beforethe first horseless carriage, but Leverett’s Ford eased across and onto theshoulder. Taking fly rod and tackle, he included pocket flask and tied an ironskillet to his belt. He’d work his way downstream a few miles. By afternoon he’dlunch on fresh trout, maybe some bullfrog legs.It was a fine clear stream, though difficult to fish as dense bushes hung outfrom the bank, broken with stretches of open water hard to work without beingseen. But the trout rose boldly to his fly, and Leverett was in fine spirits.From the bridge the valley along Mann Brook began as fairly open pasture, buthalf a mile downstream the land had fallen into disuse and was thick withsecond-growth evergreens and scrub-apple trees. Another mile, and the scrubmerged with dense forest, which continued unbroken. The land here, he hadlearned, had been taken over by the state many years back.As Leverett followed the stream he noted the remains of an old railroadembankment. No vestige of tracks or ties—only the embankment itself, overgrownwith large trees. The artist rejoiced in the beautiful dry-wall culvertsspanning the stream as it wound through the valley. To his mind it seemed eerie,this forgotten railroad running straight and true through virtual wilderness.He could imagine an old wood-burner with its conical stack, steaming alongthrough the valley dragging two or three wooden coaches. It must be a branch ofthe old Oswego Midland Rail Road, he decided, abandoned rather suddenly in the1870s. Leverett, who had a memory for detail, knew of it from a story hisgrandfather told of riding the line in 1871 from Otselic to DeRuyter on hishoneymoon. The engine had so labored up the steep grade over Crumb Hill that hegot off to walk alongside. Probably that sharp grade was the reason for theline’s abandonment.When he came across a scrap of board nailed to several sticks set into a stonewall, his darkest thought was that it might read “No Trespassing.” Curiously,though the board was weathered featureless, the nails seemed quite new. Leverettscarcely gave it much thought, until a short distance beyond he came uponanother such contrivance. And another.Now he scratched at the day’s stubble on his long jaw. This didn’t make sense. Aprank? But on whom? A child’s game? No, the arrangement was far toosophisticated. As an artist, Leverett appreciated the craftsmanship of thework—the calculated angles and lengths, the designed intricacy of themaddeningly inexplicable devices. There was something distinctly uncomfortableabout their effect.Leverett reminded himself that he had come here to fish and continueddownstream. But as he worked around a thicket he again stopped in puzzlement.Here was a small open space with more of the stick lattices and an arrangementof flat stones laid out on the ground. The stones—likely taken from one of themany dry-wall culverts—made a pattern maybe twenty by fifteen feet, that atfirst glance resembled a ground plan for a house. Intrigued, Leverett quicklysaw that this was not so. If the ground plan for anything, it would have to befor a small maze.The bizarre lattice structures were all around. Sticks from trees and bits ofboard nailed together in fantastic array. They defied description; no two seemedalike. Some were only one or two sticks lashed together in parallel or atangles. Others were worked into complicated lattices of dozens of sticks andboards. One could have been a child’s tree house—it was built in three planes,but was so abstract and useless that it could be nothing more than an insaneconglomeration of sticks and wire. Sometimes the contrivances were stuck in apile of stones or a wall, maybe thrust into the railroad embankment or nailed toa tree.It should have been ridiculous. It wasn’t. Instead it seemed somehowsinister—these utterly inexplicable, meticulously constructed lattices spreadthrough a wilderness where only a tree-grown embankment or a forgotten stonewall gave evidence that man had ever passed through. Leverett forgot about troutand frog legs, instead dug into his pockets for a notebook and stub of pencil.Busily he began to sketch the more intricate structures. Perhaps someone couldexplain them; perhaps there was something to their insane complexity thatwarranted closer study for his own work.Leverett was roughly two miles from the bridge when he came upon the ruins of ahouse. It was an unlovely colonial farmhouse, box-shaped and gambrel-roofed,fast falling into the ground. Windows were dark and empty; the chimneys oneither end looked ready to topple. Rafters showed through open spaces in theroof, and the weathered boards of the walls had in places rotted away to revealhewn timber beams. The foundation was stone and disproportionately massive. Fromthe size of the unmortared stone blocks, its builder had intended the foundationto stand forever.The house was nearly swallowed up by undergrowth and rampant lilac bushes, butLeverett could distinguish what had been a lawn with imposing shade trees.Farther back were gnarled and sickly apple trees and an overgrown garden where afew lost flowers still bloomed—wan and serpentine from years in the wild. Thestick lattices were everywhere—the lawn, the trees, even the house, were coveredwith the uncanny structures. They reminded Leverett of a hundred misshapenspiderwebs—grouped so closely together as to almost ensnare the entire house andclearing. Wondering, he sketched page on page of them, as he cautiouslyapproached the abandoned house.He wasn’t certain just what he expected to find inside. The aspect of thefarmhouse was frankly menacing, standing as it did in gloomy desolation wherethe forest had devoured the works of man—where the only sign that man had beenhere in this century were these insanely wrought latticeworks of sticks andboard. Some might have turned back at this point. Leverett, whose fascinationfor the macabre was evident in his art, instead was intrigued. He drew a roughsketch of the farmhouse and the grounds, overrun with the enigmatic devices,with thickets of hedges and distorted flowers. He regretted that it might beyears before he could capture the eeriness of this place on scratchboard orcanvas.The door was off its hinges, and Leverett gingerly stepped within, hoping thatthe flooring remained sound enough to bear even his sparse frame. The afternoonsun pierced the empty windows, mottling the decaying floorboards with greatblotches of light. Dust drifted in the sunlight. The house was empty—stripped offurnishings other than indistinct tangles of rubble mounded over with decay andthe drifted leaves of many seasons.Someone had been here, and recently. Someone who had literally covered themildewed walls with diagrams of the mysterious lattice structures. The drawingswere applied directly to the walls, crisscrossing the rotting wallpaper andcrumbling plaster in bold black lines. Some of vertiginous complexity covered anentire wall like a mad mural. Others were small, only a few crossed lines, andreminded Leverett of cuneiform glyphics.His pencil hurried over the pages of his notebook. Leverett noted withfascination that a number of the drawings were recognizable as schematics oflattices he had earlier sketched. Was this then the planning room for the madmanor educated idiot who had built these structures? The gouges etched by thecharcoal into the soft plaster appeared fresh—done days or months ago, perhaps.A darkened doorway opened into the cellar. Were there drawings there as well?And what else? Leverett wondered if he should dare it. Except for streamers oflight that crept through cracks in the flooring, the cellar was in darkness.“Hello?” he called. “Anyone here?” It didn’t seem silly just then. These sticklattices hardly seemed the work of a rational mind. Leverett wasn’t enthusiasticwith the prospect of encountering such a person in this dark cellar. It occurredto him that virtually anything might transpire here, and no one in the world of1942 would ever know.And that in itself was too great a fascination for one of Leverett’stemperament. Carefully he started down the cellar stairs. They were stone andthus solid, but treacherous with moss and debris.The cellar was enormous—even more so in the darkness. Leverett reached the footof the steps and paused for his eyes to adjust to the damp gloom. An earlierimpression recurred to him. The cellar was too big for the house. Had anotherdwelling stood here originally—perhaps destroyed and rebuilt by one of lesserfortune? He examined the stonework. Here were great blocks of gneiss that mightsupport a castle. On closer look they reminded him of a fortress—for thedry-wall technique was startlingly Mycenaean.Like the house above, the cellar appeared to be empty, although without lightLeverett could not be certain what the shadows hid. There seemed to be darkerareas of shadow along sections of the foundation wall, suggesting openings tochambers beyond. Leverett began to feel uneasy in spite of himself.There was something here—a large table-like bulk in the center of the cellar.Where a few ghosts of sunlight drifted down to touch its edges, it seemed to beof stone. Cautiously he crossed the stone paving to where it loomed—waist-high,maybe eight feet long and less wide. A roughly shaped slab of gneiss, he judged,and supported by pillars of unmortared stone. In the darkness he could only geta vague conception of the object. He ran his hand along the slab. It seemed tohave a groove along its edge.His groping fingers encountered fabric, something cold and leathery andyielding. Mildewed harness, he guessed in distaste.Something closed on his wrist, set icy nails into his flesh.Leverett screamed and lunged away with frantic strength. He was held fast, butthe object on the stone slab pulled upward.A sickly beam of sunlight came down to touch one end of the slab. It was enough.As Leverett struggled backward and the thing that held him heaved up from thestone table, its face passed through the beam of light.It was a lich’s face—desiccated flesh tight over its skull. Filthy strands ofhair were matted over its scalp, tattered lips were drawn away from brokenyellowed teeth, and, sunken in their sockets, eyes that should be dead werebright with hideous life.Leverett screamed again, desperate with fear. His free hand clawed the ironskillet tied to his belt. Ripping it loose, he smashed at the nightmarish facewith all his strength.For one frozen instant of horror the sunlight let him see the skillet crushthrough the mould-eaten forehead like an axe—cleaving the dry flesh and brittlebone. The grip on his wrist failed. The cadaverous face fell away, and the sightof its caved-in forehead and unblinking eyes from between which thick blood hadbegun to ooze would awaken Leverett from nightmare on countless nights.But now Leverett tore free and fled. And when his aching legs faltered as heplunged headlong through the scrub-growth, he was spurred to desperate energy bythe memory of the footsteps that had stumbled up the cellar stairs behind him.IIWhen Colin Leverett returned from the War, his friends marked him a changed man.He had aged. There were streaks of gray in his hair; his springy step hadslowed. The athletic leanness of his body had withered to an unhealthygauntness. There were indelible lines to his face, and his eyes were haunted.More disturbing was an alteration of temperament. A mordant cynicism had erodedhis earlier air of whimsical asceticism. His fascination with the macabre hadassumed a darker mood, a morbid obsession that his old acquaintances founddisquieting. But it had been that kind of a war, especially for those who hadfought through the Apennines.Leverett might have told them otherwise, had he cared to discuss his nightmarishexperience on Mann Brook. But Leverett kept his own counsel, and when he grimlyrecalled that creature he had struggled with in the abandoned cellar, he usuallyconvinced himself it had only been a derelict—a crazy hermit whose appearancehad been distorted by the poor light and his own imagination. Nor had his blowmore than glanced off the man’s forehead, he reasoned, since the other hadrecovered quickly enough to give chase. It was best not to dwell upon suchmatters, and this rational explanation helped restore sanity when he awoke fromnightmares of that face.Thus Colin Leverett returned to his studio, and once more plied his pens andbrushes and carving knives. The pulp magazines, where fans had acclaimed hiswork before the War, welcomed him back with long lists of assignments. Therewere commissions from galleries and collectors, unfinished sculptures and woodenmodels. Leverett busied himself.There were problems now. Short Stories returned a cover painting as “toogrotesque.” The publishers of a new anthology of horror stories sent back a pairof his interior drawings—“too gruesome, especially the rotted, bloated faces ofthose hanged men.” A customer returned a silver figurine, complaining that themartyred saint was too thoroughly martyred. Even Weird Tales, after heraldinghis return to its ghoul-haunted pages, began returning illustrations theyconsidered “too strong, even for our readers.”Leverett tried halfheartedly to tone things down, found the results vapid anduninspired. Eventually the assignments stopped trickling in. Leverett, becomingmore the recluse as years went by, dismissed the pulp days from his mind.Working quietly in his isolated studio, he found a living doing occasionalcommissioned pieces and gallery work, from time to time selling a painting orsculpture to major museums. Critics had much praise for his bizarre abstractsculptures.IIIThe War was twenty-five years history when Colin Leverett received a letter froma good friend of the pulp days—Prescott Brandon, now editor-publisher of GothicHouse, a small press that specialized in books of the weird-fantasy genre.Despite a lapse in correspondence of many years, Brandon’s letter began in histypically direct style:The Eyrie/Salem, Mass./Aug. 2To the Macabre Hermit of the Midlands:Colin, I’m putting together a deluxe 3-volume collection of H. Kenneth Allard’shorror stories. I well recall that Kent’s stories were personal favorites ofyours. How about shambling forth from retirement and illustrating these for me?Will need 2-color jackets and a dozen line interiors each. Would hope that youcan startle fandom with some especially ghastly drawings for these—somethingdifferent from the hackneyed skulls and bats and werewolves carting offhalf-dressed ladies.Interested? I’ll send you the materials and details, and you can have a freehand. Let us hear—Scotty.Leverett was delighted. He felt some nostalgia for the pulp days, and he hadalways admired Allard’s genius in transforming visions of cosmic horror intoconvincing prose. He wrote Brandon an enthusiastic reply.He spent hours rereading the stories for inclusion, making notes and preliminarysketches. No squeamish sub-editors to offend here; Scotty meant what he said.Leverett bent to his task with maniacal relish.Something different, Scotty had asked. A free hand. Leverett studied his pencilsketches critically. The figures seemed headed in the right direction, but thedrawings needed something more—something that would inject the mood of sinisterevil that pervaded Allard’s work. Grinning skulls and leathery bats? Trite.Allard demanded more.The idea had inexorably taken hold of him. Perhaps because Allard’s tales evokedthat same sense of horror; perhaps because Allard’s visions of crumbling Yankeefarmhouses and their depraved secrets so reminded him of that spring afternoonat Mann Brook.…Although he had refused to look at it since the day he had staggered in,half-dead from terror and exhaustion, Leverett perfectly recalled where he hadflung his notebook. He retrieved it from the back of a seldom-used file, thumbedthrough the wrinkled pages thoughtfully. These hasty sketches reawakened thesense of foreboding evil, the charnel horror of that day. Studying the bizarrelattice patterns, it seemed impossible to Leverett that others would not sharehis feeling of horror that the stick structures evoked in him.He began to sketch bits of stick latticework into his pencil roughs. Thesneering faces of Allard’s degenerate creatures took on an added shadow ofmenace. Leverett nodded, pleased with the effect.IVSome months afterward a letter from Brandon informed Leverett he had receivedthe last of the Allard drawings and was enormously pleased with the work.Brandon added a postscript:For God’s sake, Colin—What is it with these insane sticks you’ve got poking upeverywhere in the illos! The damn things get really creepy after a while. How onearth did you get onto this?Leverett supposed he owed Brandon some explanation. Dutifully he wrote a lengthyletter, setting down the circumstances of his experience at Mann Brook—omittingonly the horror that had seized his wrist in the cellar. Let Brandon think himeccentric, but not madman and murderer.Brandon’s reply was immediate:Colin—Your account of the Mann Brook episode is fascinating—and incredible! Itreads like the start of one of Allard’s stories! I have taken the liberty offorwarding your letter to Alexander Stefroi in Pelham. Dr. Stefroi is an earnestscholar of this region’s history—as you may already know. I’m certain youraccount will interest him, and he may have some light to shed on the uncannyaffair.Expect 1st volume, Voices from the Shadow, to be ready from the binder nextmonth. The proofs looked great. Best—Scotty.The following week brought a letter postmarked Pelham, Massachusetts:A mutual friend, Prescott Brandon, forwarded your fascinating account ofdiscovering curious sticks and stone artifacts on an abandoned farm in upstateNew York. I found this most intriguing, and wonder if you recall furtherdetails? Can you relocate the exact site after 30 years? If possible, I’d liketo examine the foundations this spring, as they call to mind similar megalithicsites of this region. Several of us are interested in locating what we believeare remains of megalithic construction dating back to the Bronze Age, and todetermine their possible use in rituals of black magic in colonial days.Present archaeological evidence indicates that ca. 1700–2000 BC there was aninflux of Bronze Age peoples into the Northeast from Europe. We know that theBronze Age saw the rise of an extremely advanced culture, and that as seafarersthey were to have no peers until the Vikings. Remains of a megalithic cultureoriginating in the Mediterranean can be seen in the Lion Gate in Mycenae, in theStonehenge, and in dolmens, passage graves, and barrow mounds throughout Europe.Moreover, this seems to have represented far more than a style of architecturepeculiar to the era. Rather, it appears to have been a religious cult whoseadherents worshipped a sort of earth-mother, served her with fertility ritualsand sacrifices, and believed that immortality of the soul could be securedthrough interment in megalithic tombs.That this culture came to America cannot be doubted from the hundreds ofmegalithic remnants found—and now recognized—in our region. The most importantsite to date is Mystery Hill in N.H., comprising a great many walls and dolmensof megalithic construction—most notably the Y Cavern barrow mound and theSacrificial Table (see postcard). Less spectacular megalithic sites include thegroup of cairns and carved stones at Mineral Mt., subterranean chambers withstone passageways such as at Petersham and Shutesbury, and uncounted shapedmegaliths and buried “monk’s cells” throughout this region.Of further interest, these sites seem to have retained their mystic aura for theearly colonials, and numerous megalithic sites show evidence of having been usedfor sinister purposes by colonial sorcerers and alchemists. This becameparticularly true after the witchcraft persecutions drove many practitionersinto the western wilderness—explaining why upstate New York and western Mass.have seen the emergence of so many cultist groups in later years.Of particular interest here is Shadrach Ireland’s “Brethren of the New Light,”who believed that the world was soon to be destroyed by sinister “Powers fromOutside” and that they, the elect, would then attain physical immortality. Theelect who died beforehand were to have their bodies preserved on tables of stoneuntil the “Old Ones” came forth to return them to life. We have definitelylinked the megalithic sites at Shutesbury to later unwholesome practices of theNew Light cult. They were absorbed in 1781 by Mother Ann Lee’s Shakers, andIreland’s putrescent corpse was hauled from the stone table in his cellar andburied.Thus I think it probable that your farmhouse may have figured in similar hiddenpractices. At Mystery Hill a farmhouse was built in 1826 that incorporated onedolmen in its foundations. The house burned down ca. 1848–55, and there weresome unsavory local stories as to what took place there. My guess is that yourfarmhouse had been built over or incorporated a similar megalithic site—and thatyour “sticks” indicate some unknown cult still survived there. I can recallcertain vague references to lattice devices figuring in secret ceremonies, butcan pinpoint nothing definite. Possibly they represent a development of occultsymbols to be used in certain conjurations, but this is just a guess. I suggestyou consult Waite’s Ceremonial Magic or such to see if you can recognize similarmagical symbols.Hope this is of some use to you. Please let me hear back.Sincerely, Alexander Stefroi.There was a postcard enclosed—a photograph of a 4½-ton granite slab, ringed by adeep groove with a spout, identified as the Sacrificial Table at Mystery Hill.On the back Stefroi had written:You must have found something similar to this. They are not rare—we have one inPelham removed from a site now beneath Quabbin Reservoir. They were used forsacrifice—animal and human—and the groove is to channel blood into a bowl,presumably.Leverett dropped the card and shuddered. Stefroi’s letter reawakened the oldhorror, and he wished now he had let the matter lie forgotten in his files. Ofcourse, it couldn’t be forgotten—even after thirty years.He wrote Stefroi a careful letter, thanking him for his information and adding afew minor details to his account. This spring, he promised, wondering if hewould keep that promise, he would try to relocate the farmhouse on Mann Brook.VSpring was late that year, and it was not until early June that Colin Leverettfound time to return to Mann Brook. On the surface, very little had changed inthree decades. The ancient stone bridge yet stood, nor had the country lane beenpaved. Leverett wondered whether anyone had driven past since his terror-spedflight.He found the old railroad grade easily as he started downstream. Thirty years,he told himself—but the chill inside him only tightened. The going was far moredifficult than before. The day was unbearably hot and humid. Wading through therank underbrush raised clouds of black flies that savagely bit him.Evidently the stream had seen severe flooding in the past years, judging frompiled logs and debris that blocked his path. Stretches were scooped out tobarren rocks and gravel. Elsewhere gigantic barriers of uprooted trees anddebris looked like ancient and mouldering fortifications. As he worked his waydown the valley, he realized that his search would yield nothing. So intense hadbeen the force of the long-ago flood that even the course of the stream hadchanged. Many of the dry-wall culverts no longer spanned the brook, but sat lostand alone far back from its present banks. Others had been knocked flat andswept away, or were buried beneath tons of rotting logs.At one point Leverett found remnants of an apple orchard groping through weedsand bushes. He thought that the house must be close by, but here the floodinghad been particularly severe, and evidently even those ponderous stonefoundations had been toppled over and buried beneath debris.Leverett finally turned back to his car. His step was lighter.A few weeks later he received a response from Stefroi to his reported failure:Forgive my tardy reply to your letter of 13 June. I have recently been pursuinginquiries which may, I hope, lead to the discovery of a previously unreportedmegalithic site of major significance. Naturally I am disappointed that notraces remained of the Mann Brook site. While I tried not to get my hopes up, itdid seem likely that the foundations would have survived. In searching throughregional data, I note that there were particularly severe flash floods in theOtselic area in July 1942 and again in May 1946. Very probably your oldfarmhouse with its enigmatic devices was utterly destroyed not very long afteryour discovery of the site. This is weird and wild country, and doubtless thereis much we shall never know.I write this with a profound sense of personal loss over the death two nightsago of Prescott Brandon. This was a severe blow to me—as I am sure it was to youand to all who knew him. I only hope the police will catch the vicious killerswho did this senseless act—evidently thieves were surprised while ransacking hisoffice. Police believe the killers were high on drugs from the mindlessbrutality of their crime.I had just received a copy of the third Allard volume, Unhallowed Places. Asuperbly designed book, and this tragedy becomes all the more insuperable withthe realization that Scotty will give the world no more such treasures. Insorrow, Alexander Stefroi.Leverett stared at the letter in shock. He had not received news of Brandon’sdeath—had only a few days before opened a parcel from the publisher containing afirst copy of Unhallowed Places. A line in Brandon’s last letter recurred tohim—a line that seemed amusing to him at the time:Your sticks have bewildered a good many fans, Colin, and I’ve worn out a ribbonanswering inquiries. One fellow in particular—a Major George Leonard—has pressedme for details, and I’m afraid that I told him too much. He has written severaltimes for your address, but knowing how you value your privacy I told him simplyto permit me to forward any correspondence. He wants to see your originalsketches, I gather, but these overbearing occult-types give me a pain. Frankly,I wouldn’t care to meet the man myself.VI“Mr. Colin Leverett?”Leverett studied the tall lean man who stood smiling at the doorway of hisstudio. The sports car he had driven up in was black and looked expensive. Thesame held for the turtleneck and leather slacks he wore, and the sleek briefcasehe carried. The blackness made his thin face deathly pale. Leverett guessed hisage to be late forty by the thinning of his hair. Dark glasses hid his eyes,black driving gloves his hands.“Scotty Brandon told me where to find you,” the stranger said.“Scotty?” Leverett’s voice was wary.“Yes, we lost a mutual friend, I regret to say. I’d been talking with him justbefore.… But I see by your expression that Scotty never had time to write.”He fumbled awkwardly. “I’m Dana Allard.”“Allard?”His visitor seemed embarrassed. “Yes—H. Kenneth Allard was my uncle.”“I hadn’t realized Allard left a family,” mused Leverett, shaking the extendedhand. He had never met the writer personally, but there was a strong resemblanceto the few photographs he had seen. And Scotty had been paying royalty checks toan estate of some sort, he recalled.“My father was Kent’s half-brother. He later took his father’s name, but therewas no marriage, if you follow.”“Of course.” Leverett was abashed. “Please find a place to sit down. And whatbrings you here?”Dana Allard tapped his briefcase. “Something I’d been discussing with Scotty.Just recently I turned up a stack of my uncle’s unpublished manuscripts.” Heunlatched the briefcase and handed Leverett a sheaf of yellowed paper. “Fathercollected Kent’s personal effects from the state hospital as next-of-kin. Henever thought much of my uncle, or his writing. He stuffed this away in ourattic and forgot about it. Scotty was quite excited when I told him of mydiscovery.”Leverett was glancing through the manuscript—page on page of crampedhandwriting, with revisions pieced throughout like an indecipherable puzzle. Hehad seen photographs of Allard manuscripts. There was no mistaking this.Or the prose. Leverett read a few passages with rapt absorption. It wasauthentic—and brilliant.“Uncle’s mind seems to have taken an especially morbid turn as his illness drewon,” Dana hazarded. “I admire his work very greatly, but I find these last fewpieces … well, a bit too horrible. Especially his translation of his mythicalBook of Elders.”It appealed to Leverett perfectly. He barely noticed his guest as he pored overthe brittle pages. Allard was describing a megalithic structure his doomednarrator had encountered in the crypts beneath an ancient churchyard. There werereferences to “elder glyphics” that resembled his lattice devices.“Look here,” pointed Dana. “These incantations he records here fromAlorri-Zrokros’s forbidden tome: ‘Yogth-Yugth-Sut-Hyrath-Yogng’— Hell, I can’tpronounce them. And he has pages of them.”“This is incredible!” Leverett protested. He tried to mouth the alien syllables.It could be done. He even detected a rhythm.“Well, I’m relieved that you approve. I’d feared these last few stories andfragments might prove too much for Kent’s fans.”“Then you’re going to have them published?”Dana nodded. “Scotty was going to. I just hope those thieves weren’t searchingfor this—a collector would pay a fortune. But Scotty said he was going to keepthis secret until he was ready for announcement.” His thin face was sad.“So now I’m going to publish it myself—in a deluxe edition. And I want you toillustrate it.”“I’d feel honored!” vowed Leverett, unable to believe it.“I really liked those drawings you did for the trilogy. I’d like to see morelike those—as many as you feel like doing. I mean to spare no expense inpublishing this. And those stick things …”“Yes?”“Scotty told me the story on those. Fascinating! And you have a whole notebookof them? May I see it?”Leverett hurriedly dug the notebook from his file, returned to the manuscript.Dana paged through the book in awe. “These things are totally bizarre—and thereare references to such things in the manuscript, to make it even more fantastic.Can you reproduce them all for the book?”“All I can remember,” Leverett assured him. “And I have a good memory. But won’tthat be overdoing it?”“Not at all! They fit into the book. And they’re utterly unique. No, puteverything you’ve got into this book. I’m going to entitle it Dwellers in theEarth, after the longest piece. I’ve already arranged for its printing, so webegin as soon as you can have the art ready. And I know you’ll give it yourall.”VIIHe was floating in space. Objects drifted past him. Stars, he first thought. Theobjects drifted closer.Sticks. Stick lattices of all configurations. And then he was drifting amongthem, and he saw that they were not sticks—not of wood. The lattice designs wereof dead-pale substance, like streaks of frozen starlight. They reminded him ofglyphics of some unearthly alphabet—complex, enigmatic symbols arranged tospell … what?And there was an arrangement—a three-dimensional pattern. A maze of utterlybaffling intricacy …Then somehow he was in a tunnel. A cramped, stone-lined tunnel through which hemust crawl on his belly. The dank, moss-slimed stones pressed close about hiswriggling form, evoking shrill whispers of claustrophobic dread.And after an indefinite space of crawling through this and other stone-linedburrows, and sometimes through passages whose angles hurt his eyes, he wouldcreep forth into a subterranean chamber. Great slabs of granite a dozen feetacross formed the walls and ceiling of this buried chamber, and between theslabs other burrows pierced the earth. Altar-like, a gigantic slab of gneisswaited in the center of the chamber. A spring welled darkly between the stonepillars that supported the table. Its outer edge was encircled by a groove,sickeningly stained by the substance that clotted in the stone bowl beneath itscollecting spout.Others were emerging from the darkened burrows that ringed the chamber—slouchedfigures only dimly glimpsed and vaguely human. And a figure in a tattered cloakcame toward him from the shadow—stretched out a claw-like hand to seize hiswrist and draw him toward the sacrificial table. He followed unresistingly,knowing that something was expected of him.They reached the altar, and in the glow from the cuneiform lattices chiseledinto the gneiss slab he could see the guide’s face. A mouldering corpse-face,the rotted bone of its forehead smashed inward upon the foulness that oozedforth.…And Leverett would awaken to the echo of his screams.…He’d been working too hard, he told himself, stumbling about in the darkness,getting dressed because he was too shaken to return to sleep. The nightmares hadbeen coming every night. No wonder he was exhausted.But in his studio his work awaited him. Almost fifty drawings finished now, andhe planned another score. No wonder the nightmares.It was a grueling pace, but Dana Allard was ecstatic with the work he had done.And Dwellers in the Earth was waiting. Despite problems with typesetting, withgetting the special paper Dana wanted—the book only waited on him.Though his bones ached with fatigue, Leverett determinedly trudged through thegraying night. Certain features of the nightmare would be interesting toportray.VIIIThe last of the drawings had gone off to Dana Allard in Petersham, and Leverett,fifteen pounds lighter and gut-weary, converted part of the bonus check into acase of good whiskey. Dana had the offset presses rolling as soon as the plateswere shot from the drawings. Despite his precise planning, presses had brokendown, one printer quit for reasons not stated, there had been a bad accident atthe new printer—seemingly innumerable problems, and Dana had been furious ateach delay. But the production pushed along quickly for all that. Leverett wrotethat the book was cursed, but Dana responded that a week would see it ready.Leverett amused himself in his studio constructing stick lattices and trying tocatch up on his sleep. He was expecting a copy of the book when he received aletter from Stefroi:Have tried to reach you by phone last few days, but no answer at your house. I’mpushed for time just now, so must be brief. I have indeed uncovered anunsuspected megalithic site of enormous importance. It’s located on the estateof a long-prominent Mass family—and as I cannot receive authorization to visitit, I will not say where. Have investigated secretly (and quite illegally) for ashort time one night and was nearly caught. Came across reference to the placein collection of 17th-century letters and papers in a divinity school library.Writer denouncing the family as a brood of sorcerers and witches, references toalchemical activities and other less savory rumors—and describes undergroundstone chambers, megalithic artifacts etc. which are put to “foul usage anddiabolic praktise.” Just got a quick glimpse but his description was notexaggerated. And Colin—in creeping through the woods to get to the site, I cameacross dozens of your mysterious “sticks”! Brought a small one back and have ithere to show you. Recently constructed and exactly like your drawings. Withluck, I’ll gain admittance and find out their significance—undoubtedly they havesignificance—though these cultists can be stubborn about sharing their secrets.Will explain my interest is scientific, no exposure to ridicule—and see whatthey say. Will get a closer look one way or another. And so—I’m off! Sincerely,Alexander Stefroi.Leverett’s bushy brows rose. Allard had intimated certain dark rituals in whichthe stick lattices figured. But Allard had written over thirty years ago, andLeverett assumed the writer had stumbled onto something similar to the MannBrook site. Stefroi was writing about something current.He rather hoped Stefroi would discover nothing more than an inane hoax.The nightmares haunted him still—familiar now, for all that its scenes andphantasms were visited by him only in dream. Familiar. The terror that theyevoked was undiminished.Now he was walking through forest—a section of hills that seemed to be close by.A huge slab of granite had been dragged aside, and a pit yawned where it hadlain. He entered the pit without hesitation, and the rounded steps that leddownward were known to his tread. A buried stone chamber, and leading from itstone-lined burrows. He knew which one to crawl into.And again the underground room with its sacrificial altar and its dark springbeneath, and the gathering circle of poorly glimpsed figures. A knot of themclustered about the stone table, and as he stepped toward them he saw theypinned a frantically writhing man.It was a stoutly built man, white hair disheveled, flesh gouged and filthy.Recognition seemed to burst over the contorted features, and he wondered if heshould know the man. But now the lich with the caved-in skull was whispering inhis ear, and he tried not to think of the unclean things that peered from thatcloven brow, and instead took the bronze knife from the skeletal hand, andraised the knife high, and because he could not scream and awaken, did with theknife as the tattered priest had whispered.…And when after an interval of unholy madness, he at last did awaken, thestickiness that covered him was not cold sweat, nor was it nightmare thehalf-devoured heart he clutched in one fist.IXLeverett somehow found sanity enough to dispose of the shredded lump of flesh.He stood under the shower all morning, scrubbing his skin raw. He wished hecould vomit.There was a news item on the radio. The crushed body of noted archaeologist, Dr.Alexander Stefroi, had been discovered beneath a fallen granite slab nearWhately. Police speculated the gigantic slab had shifted with the scientist’sexcavations at its base. Identification was made through personal effects.When his hands stopped shaking enough to drive, Leverett fled toPetersham—reaching Dana Allard’s old stone house about dark. Allard was slow toanswer his frantic knock.“Why, good evening, Colin! What a coincidence your coming here just now! Thebooks are ready. The bindery just delivered them.”Leverett brushed past him. “We’ve got to destroy them!” he blurted. He’d thoughta lot since morning.“Destroy them?”“There’s something none of us figured on. Those stick lattices—there’s a cult,some damnable cult. The lattices have some significance in their rituals.Stefroi hinted once they might be glyphics of some sort, I don’t know. But thecult is still alive. They killed Scotty … they killed Stefroi. They’re onto me—Idon’t know what they intend. They’ll kill you to stop you from releasing thisbook!”Dana’s frown was worried, but Leverett knew he hadn’t impressed him the rightway. “Colin, this sounds insane. You really have been overextending yourself,you know. Look, I’ll show you the books. They’re in the cellar.”Leverett let his host lead him downstairs. The cellar was quite large,flagstoned, and dry. A mountain of brown-wrapped bundles awaited them.“Put them down here where they wouldn’t knock the floor out,” Dana explained.“They start going out to distributors tomorrow. Here, I’ll sign your copy.”Distractedly Leverett opened a copy of Dwellers in the Earth. He gazed at hislovingly rendered drawings of rotting creatures and buried stone chambers andstained altars—and everywhere the enigmatic latticework structures. Heshuddered.“Here.” Dana Allard handed Leverett the book he had signed. “And to answer yourquestion, they are elder glyphics.”But Leverett was staring at the inscription in its unmistakable handwriting:“For Colin Leverett, Without whom this work could not have seen completion—H.Kenneth Allard.”Allard was speaking. Leverett saw places where the hastily applied flesh-tonedmakeup didn’t quite conceal what lay beneath. “Glyphics symbolic of aliendimensions—inexplicable to the human mind, but essential fragments of anevocation so unthinkably vast that the ‘pentagram’ (if you will) is milesacross. Once before we tried—but your iron weapon destroyed part of Althol’sbrain. He erred at the last instant—almost annihilating us all. Althol had beenformulating the evocation since he fled the advance of iron four millennia past.“Then you reappeared, Colin Leverett—you with your artist’s knowledge anddiagrams of Althol’s symbols. And now a thousand new minds will read theevocation you have returned to us, unite with our minds as we stand in theHidden Places. And the Great Old Ones will come forth from the earth, and we,the dead who have steadfastly served them, shall be masters of the living.”Leverett turned to run, but now they were creeping forth from the shadows of thecellar, as massive flagstones slid back to reveal the tunnels beyond. He beganto scream as Althol came to lead him away, but he could not awaken, could onlyfollow.* Originally published in Whispers, March 1974."},{"pageContent":"THE FRESHMAN*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]PHILIP JOSÉ FARMER[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]The long-haired youth in front of Desmond wore sandals, ragged blue jeans, and agrimy T-shirt. A paperback, The Collected Works of Robert Blake, was half stuckinto his rear pocket. When he turned around, he displayed in large letters onthe T-shirt, M.U. His scrawny Fu Manchu mustache held some bread crumbs.His yellow eyes—surely he suffered from jaundice—widened when he saw Desmond. Hesaid, “This ain’t the place to apply for the nursing home, Pops.” He grinned,showing unusually long canines, and then turned to face the admissions desk.Desmond felt his face turning red. Ever since he’d gotten into the line before atable marked Toaahd Freshmen A-D, he’d been aware of the sidelong glances, thesnickers, the low-voiced comments. He stood out among these youths like abillboard in a flower garden, a corpse on a banquet table.The line moved ahead by one person. The would-be students were talking, buttheir voices were subdued. For such young people, they were very restrained,excepting the smart aleck just ahead of him.Perhaps it was the surroundings that repressed them. This gymnasium, built inthe late nineteenth century, had not been repainted for years. The once-greenpaint was peeling. There were broken windows high on the walls; a shatteredskylight had been covered with boards. The wooden floor bent and creaked, andthe basketball goal rings (?) were rusty. Yet M.U. had been league champions inall fields of sports for many years. Though its enrollment was much less thanthat of its competitors, its teams somehow managed to win, often by largescores.Desmond buttoned his jacket. Though it was a warm fall day, the air in thebuilding was cold. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought that thewall of an iceberg was just behind him. Above him the great lights struggled toovercome the darkness that lowered like the underside of a dead whale sinkinginto sea depths.He turned around. The girl just back of him smiled. She wore a flowing dashikicovered with astrological symbols. Her black hair was cut short; her featureswere petite and well-arranged but too pointed to be pretty.Among all these youths there should have been a number of pretty girls andhandsome men. He’d walked enough campuses to get an idea of the index of beautyof college students. But here … There was a girl, in the line to the right,whose face should have made her eligible to be a fashion model. Yet, there wassomething missing.No, there was something added. A quality undefinable but … Repugnant? No, now itwas gone. No, it was back again. It flitted on and off, like a bat swooping fromdarkness into a grayness and then up and out.The kid in front of him had turned again. He was grinning like a fox who’d justseen a chicken.“Some dish, heh, Pops? She likes older men. Maybe you two could get your shittogether and make beautiful music.”The odor of unwashed body and clothes swirled around him like flies around adead rat.“I’m not interested in girls with Oedipus complexes,” Desmond said coldly.“At your age you can’t be particular,” the youth said, and turned away.Desmond flushed, and he briefly fantasized knocking the kid down. It didn’t helpmuch.The line moved ahead again. He looked at his wristwatch. In half an hour he wasscheduled to phone his mother. He should have come here sooner. However, he hadoverslept while the alarm clock had run down, resuming its ticking as if itdidn’t care. Which it didn’t, of course, though he felt that his possessionsshould, somehow, take an interest in him. This was irrational, but if he was abeliever in the superiority of the rational, would he be here? Would any ofthese students?The line moved jerkily ahead like a centipede halting now and then to make sureno one had stolen any of its legs. When he was ten minutes late for the phonecall, he was at the head of the line. Behind the admissions table was a man farolder than he. His face was a mass of wrinkles, gray dough that had been incisedwith fingernails and then pressed into somewhat human shape. The nose was acuttlefish’s beak stuck into the dough. But the eyes beneath the white chaoticeyebrows were as alive as blood flowing from holes in the flesh.The hand which took Desmond’s papers and punched cards was not that of an oldman’s. It was big and swollen, white, smooth-skinned. The fingernails weredirty.“The Roderick Desmond, I assume.”The voice was rasping, not at all an old man’s cracked quavering.“Ah, you know me?”“Of you, yes. I’ve read some of your novels of the occult. And ten years ago Irejected your request for Xeroxes of certain parts of the book.”The name tag on the worn tweed jacket said: R. Layamon, COTOAAHD. So this wasthe chairman of the Committee of the Occult Arts and History Department.“Your paper on the non-Arabic origin of Alhazred’s name was a brilliant piece oflinguistic research. I knew that it wasn’t Arabic or even Semitic, but I confessthat I didn’t know the century in which the word was dropped from the Arabiclanguage. Your exposition of how it was retained only in connection with theYemenite and that its original meaning was not mad butone-who-sees-what-shouldn’t-be-seen was quite correct.”He paused, then said smiling, “Did your mother complain when she was forced toaccompany you to Yemen?”Desmond said, “No-n-n-o-body forced her.”He took a deep breath and said, “But how did you know she …?”“I’ve read some biographical accounts of you.”Layamon chuckled. It sounded like nails being shifted in a barrel. “Your paperon Alhazred and the knowledge you display in your novels are the main reasonswhy you’re being admitted to this department despite your sixty years.”He signed the forms and handed the card back to Desmond. “Take this to thecashier’s office. Oh, yes, your family is a remarkably long-lived one, isn’t it?Your father died accidentally, but his father lived to be one hundred and two.Your mother is eighty, but she should live to be over a hundred. And you, youcould have forty more years of life as you’ve known it.”Desmond was enraged, but not so much that he dared let himself show it. The grayair became black, and the old man’s face shone in it. It floated toward him,expanded, and suddenly Desmond was inside the gray wrinkles. It was not apleasant place.The tiny figures on a dimly haloed horizon danced, then faded, and he fellthrough a bellowing blackness. The air was gray again, and he was leaningforward, clenching the edge of the table.“Mr. Desmond, do you have these attacks often?”Desmond released his grip and straightened. “Too much excitement, I suppose. No,I’ve never had an attack, not now or ever.”The old man chuckled. “Yes, it must be emotional stress. Perhaps you’ll find themeans for relieving that stress here.”Desmond turned and walked away. Until he left the building, he saw only blurredfigures and signs. That ancient wizard … how had he known his thoughts so well?Was it simply because he had read the biographical accounts, made a fewinquiries, and then surmised a complete picture? Or was there more to it thanthat?The sun had gone behind thick sluggish clouds. Past the campus, past many treeshiding the houses of the city, were the Tamsiqueg Hills. According to thelong-extinct Indians after whom they were named, they had once been evil giantswho’d waged war with the hero Mikatoonis and his magic-making friend, Chegaspat.Chegaspat had been killed, but Mikatoonis had turned the giants into stone witha magical club.But Cotoaahd, the chief giant, was able to free himself from the spell every fewcenturies. Sometimes, a sorcerer could loose him. Then Cotoaahd walked abroadfor a while before returning to his rocky slumber. In 1724 a house and manytrees on the edge of the town had been flattened one stormy night as if colossalfeet had stepped upon them. And the broken trees formed a trail which led to thecuriously shaped hill known as Cotoaahd.There was nothing about these stories that couldn’t be explained by the tendencyof the Indians, and the superstitious eighteenth-century whites, to legendizenatural phenomena. But was it entirely coincidence that the anagram of thecommittee headed by Layamon duplicated the giant’s name?Suddenly, he became aware that he was heading for a telephone booth. He lookedat his watch and felt panicky. The phone in his dormitory room would be ringing.It would be better to call her from the booth and save the three minutes itwould take to walk to the dormitory.He stopped. No, if he called from the booth, he would only get a busy signal.“Forty more years of life as you’ve known it,” the chairman had said.Desmond turned. His path was blocked by an enormous youth. He was a head tallerthan Desmond’s six feet and so fat he looked like a smaller version of the SantaClaus balloon in Macy’s Christmas-day parade. He wore a dingy sweatshirt on thefront of which was the ubiquitous M.U., unpressed pants, and torn tennis shoes.In banana-sized fingers he held a salami sandwich which Gargantua would not havefound too small.Looking at him, Desmond suddenly realized that most of the students here weretoo thin or too fat.“Mr. Desmond?”“Right.”He shook hands. The fellow’s skin was wet and cold, but the hand exerted apowerful pressure.“I’m Wendell Trepan. With your knowledge, you’ve heard about my ancestors. Themost famous, or infamous, of whom was the Cornish witch, Rachel Trepan.”“Yes. Rachel of the hamlet of Tredannick Wollas, near Poldhu Bay.”“I knew you’d know. I’m following the trade of my ancestors, though morecautiously, of course. Anyway, I’m a senior and the chairperson of the rushingcommittee for the Lam Kha Alif fraternity.”He paused to bite into the sandwich. Mayonnaise and salami and cheese oozingfrom his mouth, he said, “You’re invited to the party we’re holding at the housethis afternoon.”The other hand reached into a pocket and brought out a card. Desmond looked atit briefly. “You want me to be a candidate for membership in your frat? I’mpretty old for that sort of thing. I’d feel out of place.…”“Nonsense, Mr. Desmond. We’re a pretty serious bunch. In fact, none of the fratshere are like any on other campuses. You should know that. We feel you’d providestability and, I’ll admit, prestige. You’re pretty well known, you know.Layamon, by the way, is a Lam Kha Alif. He tends to favor students who belong tohis frat. He’d deny it, of course, and I’ll deny it if you repeat this. But it’strue.”“Well, I don’t know. Suppose I did pledge—if I’m invited to, that is—would Ihave to live in the frat house?”“Yes. We make no exceptions. Of course, that’s only when you’re a pledge. Youcan live wherever you want to when you’re an active.”Trepan smiled, showing the unswallowed bite. “You’re not married, so there’s noproblem there.”“What do you mean by that?”“Nothing, Mr. Desmond. It’s just that we don’t pledge married men unless theydon’t live with their wives. Married men lose some of their power, you know. Ofcourse, no way do we insist on celibacy. We have some pretty good parties, too.Once a month we hold a big bust in a grove at the foot of Cotoaahd. Most of thewomen guests there belong to the Ba Ghay Sin sorority. Some of them really gofor the older type, if you know what I mean.”Trepan stepped forward to place his face directly above Desmond’s. “We don’tjust have beer, pot, hashish, and sisters. There’re other attractions. Brothers,if you’re so inclined. Some stuff that’s made from a recipe by the MarquisManuel de Dembron himself. But most of that is kid stuff. There’ll be a goatthere, too!”“A goat? A black goat?”Trepan nodded, and his triple-fold jowls swung. “Yeah. Old Layamon’ll be thereto supervise, though he’ll be masked, of course. With him as coach nothing cango wrong. Last Halloween, though …”He paused, then said, “Well, it was something to see.”Desmond licked dry lips. His heart was thudding like the tomtoms that beat atthe ritual of which he had only read but had envisioned many times.Desmond put the card in his pocket. “At one o’clock?”“You’re coming? Very good! See you, Mr. Desmond. You won’t regret it.”Desmond walked past the buildings of the university quadrangle, the mostimposing of which was the museum. This was the oldest structure on the campus,the original college. Time had beaten and chipped away at the brick and stone ofthe others, but the museum seemed to have absorbed time and to be slowlyradiating it back just as cement and stone and brick absorbed heat in thesunlight and then gave it back in the darkness. Also, whereas the otherstructures were covered with vines, perhaps too covered, the museum was naked ofplant life. Vines which tried to crawl up its gray bone-colored stones witheredand fell back.Layamon’s red-stone house was narrow, three stories high, and had adouble-peaked roof. Its cover of vines was so thick that it seemed a wonder thatthe weight didn’t bring it to the ground. The colors of the vines were subtlydifferent from those on the other buildings. Seen at one angle, they lookedcyanotic. From another, they were the exact green of the eyes of a Sumatransnake Desmond had seen in a colored plate in a book on herpetology.It was this venomous reptile which was used by the sorcerers of the Yan tribesto transmit messages and sometimes to kill. The writer had not explained what hemeant by “messages.” Desmond had discovered the meaning in another book, whichhad required him to learn Malay, written in the Arabic script, before he couldread it.He hurried on past the house, which was not something a sightseer would care tolook at long, and came to the dormitory. It had been built in 1888 on the siteof another building and remodeled in 1938. Its gray paint was peeling. Therewere several broken windows, over the panes of which cardboard had been nailed.The porch floorboards bent and creaked as he passed over them. The main door wasof oak, its paint long gone. The bronze head of a cat, a heavy bronze ringdangling from its mouth, served as a door knocker.Desmond entered, passed through the main room over the worn carpet, and walkedup two flights of bare-board steps. On the gray-white of a wall by the firstlanding someone had long ago written YOGSOTHOTH SUCKS. Many attempts had beenmade to wash it off, but it was evident that only paint could hide thisinsulting and dangerous sentiment. Yesterday a junior had told him that no oneknew who had written it, but the night after it had appeared, a freshman hadbeen found dead, hanging from a hook in a closet.“The kid had mutilated himself terribly before he committed suicide,” the juniorhad said. “I wasn’t here then, but I understand that he was a mess. He’d done itwith a razor and a hot iron. There was blood all over the place, his pecker andballs were on the table, arranged to form a T-cross, you know whose symbol thatis, and he’d clawed out plaster on the wall, leaving a big bloody print. Itdidn’t even look like a human hand had done it.”“I’m surprised he lived long enough to hang himself,” Desmond had said. “Allthat loss of blood, you know.”The junior had guffawed. “You’re kidding, of course!”It was several seconds before Desmond understood what he meant. Then he’d paled.But later he wondered if the junior wasn’t playing a traditional joke on a greenfreshman. He didn’t think he’d ask anybody else about it, however. If he hadbeen made a fool of, he wasn’t going to let it happen more than once.He heard the phone ringing at the end of the long hall. He sighed, and strodedown it, passing closed doors. From behind one came a faint tittering. Heunlocked his door and closed it behind him. For a long time he stood watchingthe phone, which went on and on, reminding him, he didn’t know why, of the poemabout the Australian swagman who went for a dip in a waterhole. The bunyip, thatmysterious and sinister creature of down-under folklore, the dweller in thewater, silently and smoothly took care of the swagman. And the tea kettle he’dput on the fire whistled and whistled with no one to hear.And the phone rang on and on.The bunyip was on the other end.Guilt spread through him as quick as a blush.He walked across the room glimpsing something out of the corner of his eye,something small, dark, and swift that dived under the sagging mildew-odorousbed-couch. He stopped at the small table, reached out to the receiver, touchedit, felt its cold throbbing. He snatched his hand back. It was foolish, but ithad seemed to him that she would detect his touch and know that he was there.Snarling, he wheeled and started across the room. He noticed that the hole inthe baseboard was open again. The Coke bottle whose butt end he’d jammed intothe hole had been pushed out. He stopped and reinserted it and straightened up.When he was at the foot of the staircase, he could still hear the ringing. Buthe wasn’t sure that it wasn’t just in his head.After he’d paid his tuition and eaten at the cafeteria—the food was better thanhe’d thought it would be—he walked to the ROTC building. It was in better shapethan the other structures, probably because the Army was in charge of it. Still,it wasn’t in the condition an inspector would require. And those cannons oncaissons in the rear. Were the students really supposed to train withSpanish-American War weapons? And since when was steel subject to verdigris?The officer in charge was surprised when Desmond asked to be issued his uniformand manuals.“I don’t know. You realize ROTC is no longer required of freshmen andsophomores?”Desmond insisted that he wanted to enroll. The officer rubbed his unshaven jawand blew smoke from a Tijuana Gold panatela. “Hmm. Let me see.”He consulted a book whose edges seemed to have been nibbled by rats. “Well, whatdo you know? There’s nothing in the regulations about age. Course, there’s somepages missing. Must be an oversight. Nobody near your age has ever beenconsidered. But … well, if the regulations say nothing about it, then … what thehell! Won’t hurt you, our boys don’t have to go through obstacle courses oranything like that.“But jeeze, you’re sixty! Why do you want to sign up?”Desmond did not tell him that he had been deferred from service in World War IIbecause he was the sole support of his sick mother. Ever since then, he’d feltguilty, but at least here he could do his bit—however minute—for his country.The officer stood up, though not in a coordinated manner. “Okay. I’ll see youget your issue. It’s only fair to warn you, though, that these fuckups play somemighty strange tricks. You should see what they blow out of their cannons.”Fifteen minutes later, Desmond left, a pile of uniforms and manuals under onearm. Since he didn’t want to return home with them, he checked them in at theuniversity bookstore. The girl put them on a shelf alongside other belongings,some of them unidentifiable to the noncognoscenti. One of them was a small cagecovered with a black cloth.Desmond walked to Fraternity Row. All of the houses had Arabic names, except theHouse of Hastur. These were afflicted with the same general decrepitude and lackof care as the university structures. Desmond turned in at a cement walk, fromthe cracks of which spread dying dandelions and other weeds. On his left leaneda massive wooden pole fifteen feet high. The heads and symbols carved into ithad caused the townspeople to refer to it as the totem pole. It wasn’t, ofcourse, since the tribe to which it had belonged was not Northwest Coast orAlaskan Indians. It and a fellow in the university museum were the lastsurvivors of hundreds which had once stood in this area.Desmond, passing it, put the end of his left thumb under his nose and the tip ofhis index finger in the center of his forehead, and he muttered the ancientphrase of obeisance, “Shesh-cotoaahd-ting-ononwa-senk.” According to varioustexts he’d read, this was required of every Tamsiqueg who walked by it duringthis phase of the moon. The phrase was unintelligible even to them, since itcame from another tribe or perhaps from an antique stage of the language. But itindicated respect, and lack of its observance was likely to result inmisfortune.He felt a little silly doing it, but it couldn’t hurt.The unpainted wooden steps creaked as he stepped upon them. The porch was huge;the wires of the screen were rusty and useless in keeping insects out because ofthe many holes. The front door was open; from it came a blast of rock music, theloud chatter of many people, and the acrid odor of pot.Desmond almost turned back. He suffered when he was in a crowd, and hisconsciousness of his age made him feel embarrassingly conspicuous. But the hugefigure of Wendell Trepan was in the doorway, and he was seized by an enormoushand.“Come on in!” Trepan bellowed. “I’ll introduce you to the brothers!”Desmond was pulled into a large room jammed with youths of both sexes. Trepanbulled through, halting now and then to slap somebody on the back and shout agreeting and once to pat a well-built young woman on the fanny. Then they werein a corner where Professor Layamon sat surrounded by people who looked olderthan most of the attendees. Desmond supposed that they were graduate students.He shook the fat swollen hand and said, “Pleased to meet you again,” but hedoubted that his words were heard.Layamon pulled him down so he could be heard, and he said, “Have you made upyour mind yet?”The old man’s breath was not unpleasant, but he had certainly been drinkingsomething which Desmond had never smelled before. The red eyes seemed to hold alight, almost as if tiny candles were burning inside the eyeballs.“About what?” Desmond shouted back.The old man smiled and said, “You know.”He released his grip. Desmond straightened up. Suddenly, though the room was hotenough to make him sweat, he felt chilly. What was Layamon hinting at? Itcouldn’t be that he really knew. Or could it be?Trepan introduced him to the men and women around the chair and then took himinto the crowd. Other introductions followed, most of those he met seeming to bemembers of Lam Kha Alif or of the sorority across the street. The only one hecould identify for sure as a candidacy for pledging was a black, a Gabonese.After they left him, Trepan said, “Bukawai comes from a long line of witchdoctors. He’s going to be a real treasure if he accepts our invitation, thoughthe House of Hastur and Kaf Dhal Waw are hot to get him. The department is alittle weak on Central African science. It used to have a great teacher, JaniceMomaya, but she disappeared ten years ago while on a sabbatical in Sierra Leone.I wouldn’t be surprised if Bukawai was offered an assistant professorship evenif he is nominally a freshman. Man, the other night, he taught me part of aritual you wouldn’t believe. I … well, I won’t go into it now. Some other time.Anyway, he has the greatest respect for Layamon, and since the old fart is headof the department, Bukawai is almost a cinch to join us.”Suddenly, his lips pulled back, his teeth clenched, his skin paled beneath thedirt, and he bent over and grabbed his huge paunch. Desmond said, “What’s thematter?”Trepan shook his head, gave a deep sigh, and straightened up.“Man, that hurt!”“What?” Desmond said.“I shouldn’t have called him an old fart. I didn’t think he could hear me, buthe isn’t using sound to receive. Hell, there’s nobody in the world has morerespect for him than me. But sometimes my mouth runs off … well, never again.”“You mean?” Desmond said.“Yeah. Who’d you think? Never mind. Come with me where we can hear ourselvesthink.”He pulled Desmond through a smaller room, one with many shelves of books,novels, school texts, and here and there some old leather-bound volumes.“We got a hell of a good library here, the best any house can boast of. It’s oneof our stellar attractions. But it’s the open one.”They entered a narrow door, passed into a short hall, and stopped while Trepantook a key from his pocket and unlocked another door. Beyond it was a narrowcorkscrew staircase, the steps of which were dusty. A window high above gave aweak light through dirty panes. Trepan turned on a wall light, and they went upthe stairs. At the top, which was on the third floor, Trepan unlocked anotherdoor with a different key. They stepped into a small room whose walls werecovered by bookshelves from floor to ceiling. Trepan turned on a light. In acorner was a small table and a folding chair. The table had a lamp and a stonebust of the Marquis de Dembron on it.Trepan, breathing heavily after the climb, said, “Usually, only seniors andgraduates are allowed here. But I’m making an exception in your case. I justwanted to show you one of the advantages of belonging to Lam Kha Alif. None ofthe other houses have a library like this.”Trepan was looking narrow-eyed at him. “Eyeball the books. But don’t touch them.They, uh, absorb, if you know what I mean.”Desmond moved around, looking at the titles. When he was finished, he said, “I’mimpressed. I thought some of these books were to be found only in the universitylibrary. In locked rooms.”“That’s what the public thinks. Listen, if you pledge us, you’ll have access tothese books. Only don’t tell the other undergrads. They’d get jealous.”Trepan, still narrow-eyed, as if he were considering something that perhaps heshouldn’t, said, “Would you mind turning your back and sticking your fingers inyour ears?”Desmond said, “What?”Trepan smiled. “Oh, if you sign up with us, you’ll be given the little recipenecessary to work in here. But until then I’d just as soon you don’t see it.”Desmond, smiling with embarrassment, the cause of which he couldn’t account,for, and also feeling excited, turned his back, facing away from Trepan, andjammed his fingertips into his ears. While he stood there in the very quietroom—was it soundproofed with insulation or with something perhaps notmaterial?—he counted the seconds. One thousand and one, one thousand and two …A little more than a minute had passed when he felt Trepan’s hand on hisshoulder. He turned and removed his fingers. The fat youth was holding out tohim a tall but very slim volume bound in a skin with many small darkprotuberances. Desmond was surprised, since he was sure he had not seen it onthe shelves.“I deactivated this,” Trepan said. “Here. Take it.” He looked at his wristwatch.“It’ll be okay for ten minutes.”There was no title or by-line on the cover. And, now that he looked at itclosely and felt it, he did not think the skin was from an animal.Trepan said, “It’s the hide of an old Atechironnon himself.”Desmond said, “Ah!” and he trembled. But he rallied.“He must have been covered with warts.”“Yeah. Go ahead, look at it. It’s a shame you can’t read it, though.”The first page was slightly yellowed, which wasn’t surprising for paper fourhundred years old. There was no printing but large handwritten letters.“Ye lesser Rituall of Ye Tahmmsiquegg Warlock Atechironunn,” Desmond read.“Reprodust from ye Picture-riting on ye Skin lefft unbirnt by ye Godly.“By his own Hand, Simon Conant. 1641.“Let him who speaks these Words of Pictures, first lissen.”Trepan chuckled and said, “Spelling wasn’t his forte, was it?”“Simon, the half brother of Roger Conant,” Desmond said. “He was the first whiteman to visit the Tamsiqueg and not leave with his severed thumb stuck up hisass. He was also with the settlers who raided the Tamsiqueg, but they didn’tknow who his sympathies were with. He fled with the badly wounded Atechironnoninto the wilderness. Twenty years later, he appeared in Virginia with thisbook.”He slowly turned the five pages, fixing each pictograph in his photographicmemory. There was one figure he didn’t like to look at.“Layamon’s the only one who can read it,” Trepan said.Desmond did not tell him that he was conversant with the grammar and smalldictionary of the Tamsiqueg language, written by William Cor Dunnes in 1624 andpublished in 1654. It contained an appendix translating the pictographs. It hadcost him twenty years of search and a thousand dollars just for a Xerox copy.His mother has raised hell about the expenditure, but for once he had stood upto her. Not even the university had a copy.Trepan looked at his watch. “One minute to go. Hey!”He grabbed the book from Desmond’s hands and said, harshly, “Turn your back andplug your ears!”Trepan looked as if he were in a panic. He turned, and a minute later Trepanpulled one of Desmond’s fingers away.“Sorry to be so sudden, but the hold was beginning to break down. I can’t figureit out. It’s always been good for at least ten minutes.”Desmond had not felt anything, but that might be because Trepan, having beenexposed to the influence, was more sensitive to it.Trepan, obviously nervous, said, “Let’s get out of here. It’s got to cool off.”On the way down, he said, “You sure you can’t read it?”“Where would I have learned how?” Desmond said.They plunged into a sea of noise and odors in the big room. They did not staylong, since Trepan wanted to show him the rest of the house, except thebasement.“You can see it sometime this week. Just now it’s not advisable to go downthere.”Desmond didn’t ask why.When they entered a very small room on the second floor, Trepan said,“Ordinarily we don’t let freshmen have a room to themselves. But for you … well,it’s yours if you want it.”That pleased Desmond. He wouldn’t have to put up with someone whose habits wouldirk him and whose chatter would anger him.They descended to the first floor. The big room was not so crowded now. OldLayamon, just getting up from the chair, beckoned to him. Desmond approached himslowly. For some reason, he knew he was not going to like what Layamon would sayto him. Or perhaps he wasn’t sure whether he would like it or not.“Trepan showed you the frat’s more precious books,” the chairman said. It wasn’ta question but a statement. “Especially Conant’s book.”Trepan said, “How did you …?” He grinned. “You felt it.”“Of course,” the rusty voice said. “Well, Desmond, don’t you think it’s time toanswer that phone?”Trepan looked puzzled. Desmond felt sick and cold.Layamon was now almost nose to nose with Desmond. The many wrinkles of thedoughy skin looked like hieroglyphs.“You’ve made up your mind, but you aren’t letting yourself know it,” he said.“Listen. That was Conant’s advice, wasn’t it? Listen. From the moment you gotonto the plane to Boston, you were committed. You could have backed out in theairport, but you didn’t, even though, I imagine, your mother made a scene there.But you didn’t. So there’s no use putting it off.”He chuckled. “That I am bothering to give you advice is a token of my esteem foryou. I think you’ll go far and fast. If you are able to eliminate certaindefects of character. It takes strength and intelligence and greatself-discipline and a vast dedication to get even a B.A. here, Desmond.“There are too many who enroll here because they think they’ll be taking snapcourses. Getting great power, hobnobbing with things that are really notsocially minded, to say the least, seems to them to be as easy as rolling off alog. But they soon find out that the department’s standards are higher than,say, those of MIT in engineering. And a hell of a lot more dangerous.“And then there’s the moral issue. That’s declared just by enrolling here. Buthow many have the will to push on? How many decide that they are on the wrongside? They quit, not knowing that it’s too late for any but a tiny fraction ofthem to return to the other side. They’ve declared themselves, have stood up andbeen counted forever, as it were.”He paused to light up a brown panatela. The smoke curled around Desmond, who didnot smell what he expected. The odor was not quite like that of a dead bat hehad once used in an experiment.“Every man or woman determines his or her own destiny. But I would make mydecision swiftly, if I were you. I’ve got my eye on you, and your advancementhere does depend upon my estimate of your character and potentiality.“Good day, Desmond.”The old man walked out. Trepan said, “What was that all about?”Desmond did not answer. He stood for a minute or so while Trepan fidgeted. Thenhe said good-by to the fat man and walked out slowly. Instead of going home, hewandered around the campus. Attracted by flashing red lights, he went over tosee what was going on. A car with the markings of the campus police and anambulance from the university hospital were in front of a two-story building.Its lower floor had once been a grocery store according to the letters on thedirty plate-glass window. The paint inside and out was peeling, and plaster hadfallen off the walls within, revealing the laths beneath. On the bare woodenfloor were three bodies. One was the youth who had stood just in front of him inthe line in the gymnasium. He lay on his back, his mouth open below the scragglymustache.Desmond asked one of the people pressed against the window what had happened.The gray-bearded man, probably a professor, said, “This happens every year atthis time. Some kids get carried away and try something no one but an M.A. wouldeven think of trying. It’s strictly forbidden, but that doesn’t stop those youngfools.”The corpse with the mustache seemed to have a large round black object orperhaps a burn on its forehead. Desmond wanted to get a closer look, but theambulance men put a blanket over the face before carrying the body out.The gray-bearded man said, “The university police and the hospital will handlethem.” He laughed shortly. “The city police don’t even want to come on thecampus. The relatives will be notified they’ve OD’d from heroin.”“There’s no trouble about that?”“Sometimes. Private detectives have come here, but they don’t stay long.”Desmond walked away swiftly. His mind was made up. The sight of those bodies hadshaken him. He’d go home, make peace with his mother, sell all the books he’dspent so much time and money accumulating and studying, take up writing mysterynovels. He’d seen the face of death, and if he did what he had thought about,only idly of course, fantasizing for psychic therapy, he would see her face.Dead. He couldn’t do it.When he entered his room in the boardinghouse, the phone was still ringing. Hewalked to it, reached out his hand, held it for an undeterminable time, thendropped it. As he walked toward the couch, he noticed that the Coca-Cola bottlehad been shoved or pulled out of the hole in the baseboard. He knelt down andjammed it back into the hole. From behind the wall came a faint twittering.He sat down on the sagging couch, took his notebook from his jacket pocket, andbegan to pencil in the pictographs he remembered so well on the sheets. It tookhim half an hour, since exactness of reproduction was vital. The phone did notstop ringing.Someone knocked on the door and yelled, “I saw you go in! Answer the phone ortake it off the hook! Or I’ll put something on you!”He did not reply or rise from the couch.He had left out one of the drawings in the sequence. Now he poised the pencil aninch above the black space. Sitting at the other end of the line would be a veryfat, very old woman. She was old and ugly now, but she had borne him and formany years thereafter she had been beautiful. When his father had died, she hadgone to work to keep their house and to support her son in the manner to whichboth were accustomed. She had worked hard to pay his tuition and other expenseswhile he went to college. She had continued to work until he had sold twonovels. Then she had gotten sickly, though not until he began bringing womenhome to introduce as potential wives.She loved him, but she wouldn’t let loose of him, and that wasn’t genuine love.He hadn’t been able to tear loose, which meant that though he was resentful hehad something in him which liked being caged. Then, one day, he had decided totake the big step toward freedom. It had been done secretly and swiftly. He haddespised himself for his fear of her, but that was the way he was. If he stayedhere, she would be coming here. He couldn’t endure that. So, he would have to gohome.He looked at the phone, started to rise, sank back.What to do? He could commit suicide. He’d be free, and she would know how angryhe’d been with her. He gave a start as the phone stopped ringing. So, she hadgiven up for a while. But she would return to it.He looked at the baseboard. The bottle was moving out from the hole a little ata time. Something behind the wall was working away determinedly. How many timeshad it started to leave the hole and found that its passage was blocked? Far toomany, the thing must think, if it had a mind. But it refused to give up, andsomeday it might occur to it to solve its problem by killing the one who wascausing the problem.If, however, it was daunted by the far greater size of the problem maker, if itlacked courage, then it would have to keep on pushing the bottle from the hole.And …He looked at the notebook, and he shook. The blank space had been filled in.There was the drawing of Cotoaahd, the thing which, now he looked at it, somehowresembled his mother.Had he unconsciously penciled it in while he was thinking?Or had the figure formed itself?It didn’t matter. In either case, he knew what he had to do.While the eyes passed over each drawing, and he intoned the words of thatlong-dead language, he felt something move out from within his chest, crawl intohis belly, his legs, his throat, his brain. The symbol of Cotoaahd seemed toburn on the sheet when he pronounced its name, his eyes on the drawing.The room grew dark as the final words were said. He rose and turned on a tablelamp and went into the tiny dirty bathroom. The face in the mirror did not looklike a murderer’s; it was just that of a sixty-year-old man who had been throughan ordeal and was not quite sure that it was over.On the way out of the room, he saw the Coke bottle slide free of the baseboardhole. But whatever had pushed it was not yet ready to come out.Hours later he returned reeling from the campus tavern. The phone was ringingagain. But the call, as he had expected, was not from his mother, though it wasfrom his native city in Illinois.“Mr. Desmond, this is Sergeant Rourke of the Busiris Police Department. I’mafraid I have some bad news for you. Uh, ah, your mother died some hours ago ofa heart attack.”Desmond did not have to act stunned. He was numb throughout. Even the handholding the receiver felt as if it had turned to granite. Vaguely, he was awarethat Rourke’s voice seemed strange.“Heart attack? Heart …? Are you sure?”He groaned. His mother had died naturally. He would not have had to recite theancient words. And now he had committed himself for nothing and was forevertrapped. Once the words were used while the eyes read, there was no turningback.But … if the words had been only words, dying as sound usually does, no physicalreaction resulting from words transmitted through that subcontinuum, then was hebound?Wouldn’t he be free, clear of debt? Able to walk out of this place without fearof retaliation?“It was a terrible thing, Mr. Desmond. A freak accident. Your mother died whileshe was talking to a visiting neighbor, Mrs. Sammins. Sammins called the policeand an ambulance. Some other neighbors went into the house, and then … then.…”Rourke’s throat seemed to be clogging.“I’d just got there and was on the front porch when it … it.…”Rourke coughed, and he said, “My brother was in the house, too.”Three neighbors, two ambulance attendants, and two policemen had been crushed todeath when the house had unaccountably collapsed.“It was like a giant foot stepped on it. If it’d fallen in six seconds later,I’d have been caught, too.”Desmond thanked him and said he’d take the next plane out to Busiris.He staggered to the window, and he raised it to breathe in the open air. Below,in the light of a streetlamp, hobbling along on his cane, was Layamon. The grayface lifted. Teeth flashed whitely.Desmond wept, but the tears were only for himself.* Originally published in Fantasy and Science Fiction, May 1979."},{"pageContent":"JERUSALEM’S LOT*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]STEPHEN KING[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]Oct. 2, 1850.DEAR BONES,How good it was to step into the cold, draughty hall here at Chapelwaite, everybone in an ache from that abominable coach, in need of instant relief from mydistended bladder—and to see a letter addressed in your own inimitable scrawlpropped on the obscene little cherrywood table beside the door! Be assured thatI set to deciphering it as soon as the needs of the body were attended to (in acoldly ornate downstairs bathroom where I could see my breath rising before myeyes).I’m glad to hear that you are recovered from the miasma that has so long set inyour lungs, although I assure you that I do sympathize with the moral dilemmathe cure has affected you with. An ailing abolitionist healed by the sunnyclimes of slave-struck Florida! Still and all, Bones, I ask you as a friend whohas also walked in the valley of the shadow, to take all care of yourself andventure not back to Massachusetts until your body gives you leave. Your finemind and incisive pen cannot serve us if you are clay, and if the Southern zoneis a healing one, is there not poetic justice in that?Yes, the house is quite as fine as I had been led to believe by my cousin’sexecutors, but rather more sinister. It sits atop a huge and jutting point ofland perhaps three miles north of Falmouth and nine miles north of Portland.Behind it are some four acres of grounds, gone back to the wild in the mostformidable manner imaginable—junipers, scrub vines, bushes, and various forms ofcreeper climb wildly over the picturesque stone walls that separate the estatefrom the town domain. Awful imitations of Greek statuary peer blindly throughthe wrack from atop various hillocks—they seem, in most cases, about to lunge atthe passer-by. My cousin Stephen’s tastes seem to have run the gamut from theunacceptable to the downright horrific. There is an odd little summer housewhich has been nearly buried in scarlet sumac and a grotesque sundial in themidst of what must once have been a garden. It adds the final lunatic touch.But the view from the parlour more than excuses this; I command a dizzying viewof the rocks at the foot of Chapelwaite Head and the Atlantic itself. A huge,bellied bay window looks out on this, and a huge, toadlike secretary standsbeside it. It will do nicely for the start of that novel which I have talked ofso long [and no doubt tiresomely].To-day has been gray with occasional splatters of rain. As I look out all seemsto be a study in slate—the rocks, old and worn as Time itself, the sky, and ofcourse the sea, which crashes against the granite fangs below with a sound whichis not precisely sound but vibration—I can feel the waves with my feet even as Iwrite. The sensation is not a wholly unpleasant one.I know you disapprove my solitary habits, dear Bones, but I assure you that I amfine and happy. Calvin is with me, as practical, silent, and as dependable asever, and by midweek I am sure that between the two of us we shall havestraightened our affairs and made arrangements for necessary deliveries fromtown—and a company of cleaning women to begin blowing the dust from this place!I will close—there are so many things as yet to be seen, rooms to explore, anddoubtless a thousand pieces of execrable furniture to be viewed by these tendereyes. Once again, my thanks for the touch of familiar brought by your letter,and for your continuing regard.Give my love to your wife, as you both have mine.CHARLES.Oct. 6, 1850.DEAR BONES,Such a place this is!It continues to amaze me—as do the reactions of the townfolk in the closestvillage to my occupancy. That is a queer little place with the picturesque nameof Preacher’s Corners. It was there that Calvin contracted for the weeklyprovisions. The other errand, that of securing a sufficient supply of cordwoodfor the winter, was likewise taken care of. But Cal returned with gloomycountenance, and when I asked him what the trouble was, he replied grimlyenough:“They think you mad, Mr. Boone!”I laughed and said that perhaps they had heard of the brain fever I sufferedafter my Sarah died—certainly I spoke madly enough at that time, as you couldattest.But Cal protested that no-one knew anything of me except through my cousinStephen, who contracted for the same services as I have now made provision for.“What was said, sir, was that anyone who would live in Chapelwaite must beeither a lunatic or run the risk of becoming one.”This left me utterly perplexed, as you may imagine, and I asked who had givenhim this amazing communication. He told me that he had been referred to a sullenand rather besotted pulp-logger named Thompson, who owns four hundred acres ofpine, birch, and spruce, and who logs it with the help of his five sons, forsale to the mills in Portland and to householders in the immediate area.When Cal, all unknowing of his queer prejudice, gave him the location to whichthe wood was to be brought, this Thompson stared at him with his mouth ajaw andsaid that he would send his sons with the wood, in the good light of the day,and by the sea road.Calvin, apparently misreading my bemusement for distress, hastened to say thatthe man reeked of cheap whiskey and that he had then lapsed into some kind ofnonsense about a deserted village and Cousin Stephen’s relations—and worms!Calvin finished his business with one of Thompson’s boys, who, I take it, wasrather surly and none too sober or freshly scented himself. I take it there hasbeen some of this reaction in Preacher’s Corners itself, at the general storewhere Cal spoke with the shop-keeper, although this was more of the gossipy,behind-the-hand type.None of this has bothered me much; we know how rustics dearly love to enrichtheir lives with the smell of scandal and myth, and I suppose poor Stephen andhis side of the family are fair game. As I told Cal, a man who has fallen to hisdeath almost from his own front porch is more than likely to stir talk.The house itself is a constant amazement. Twenty-three rooms, Bones! Thewainscotting which panels the upper floors and the portrait gallery is mildewedbut still stout. While I stood in my late cousin’s upstairs bedroom I could hearthe rats scuttering behind it, and big ones they must be, from the sound theymake—almost like people walking there. I should hate to encounter one in thedark; or even in the light, for that matter. Still, I have noted neither holesnor droppings. Odd.The upper gallery is lined with bad portraits in frames which must be worth afortune. Some bear a resemblance to Stephen as I remember him. I believe I havecorrectly identified my Uncle Henry Boone and his wife Judith; the others areunfamiliar. I suppose one of them may be my own notorious grandfather, Robert.But Stephen’s side of the family is all but unknown to me, for which I amheartily sorry. The same good humour that shone in Stephen’s letters to Sarahand me, the same light of high intellect, shines in these portraits, bad as theyare. For what foolish reasons families fall out! A rifled escritoire, hard wordsbetween brothers now dead three generations, and blameless descendants areneedlessly estranged. I cannot help reflecting upon how fortunate it was thatyou and John Petty succeeded in contacting Stephen when it seemed I might followmy Sarah through the Gates—and upon how unfortunate it was that chance shouldhave robbed us of a face-to-face meeting. How I would have loved to hear himdefend the ancestral statuary and furnishings!But do not let me denigrate the place to an extreme. Stephen’s taste was not myown, true, but beneath the veneer of his additions there are pieces [a number ofthem shrouded by dust-covers in the upper chambers] which are true masterworks.There are beds, tables, and heavy, dark scrollings done in teak and mahogany,and many of the bedrooms and receiving chambers, the upper study and smallparlour, hold a somber charm. The floors are rich pine that glow with an innerand secret light. There is dignity here; dignity and the weight of years. Icannot yet say I like it, but I do respect it. I am eager to watch it change aswe revolve through the changes of this northern clime.Lord, I run on! Write soon, Bones. Tell me what progress you make, and what newsyou hear from Petty and the rest. And please do not make the mistake of tryingto persuade any new Southern acquaintances as to your views too forcibly—Iunderstand that not all are content to answer merely with their mouths, as isour long-winded friend, Mr. Calhoun.Yr. affectionate friend,CHARLES.Oct. 16, 1850.DEAR RICHARD,Hello, and how are you? I have thought about you often since I have taken upresidence here at Chapelwaite, and had half-expected to hear from you—and now Ireceive a letter from Bones telling me that I’d forgotten to leave my address atthe club! Rest assured that I would have written eventually anyway, as itsometimes seems that my true and loyal friends are all I have left in the worldthat is sure and completely normal. And, Lord, how spread we’ve become! You inBoston, writing faithfully for The Liberator [to which I have also sent myaddress, incidentally], Hanson in England on another of his confounded jaunts,and poor old Bones in the very lions’ lair, recovering his lungs.It goes as well as can be expected here, Dick, and be assured I will render youa full account when I am not quite as pressed by certain events which are extanthere—I think your legal mind may be quite intrigued by certain happenings atChapelwaite and in the area about it.But in the meantime I have a favour to ask, if you will entertain it. Do youremember the historian you introduced me to at Mr. Clary’s fund-raising dinnerfor the cause? I believe his name was Bigelow. At any rate, he mentioned that hemade a hobby of collecting odd bits of historical lore which pertained to thevery area in which I am now living. My favour, then, is this: Would you contacthim and ask him what facts, bits of folklore, or general rumour—if any—he may beconversant with about a small, deserted village called JERUSALEM’S LOT, near atownship called Preacher’s Corners, on the Royal River? The stream itself is atributary of the Androscoggin, and flows into that river approximately elevenmiles above the river’s emptying place near Chapelwaite. It would gratify meintensely, and, more important, may be a matter of some moment.In looking over this letter I feel I have been a bit short with you, Dick, forwhich I am heartily sorry. But be assured I will explain myself shortly, anduntil that time I send my warmest regards to your wife, two fine sons, and, ofcourse, to yourself.Yr. affectionate friend,CHARLES.Oct. 16. 1850DEAR BONES,I have a tale to tell you which seems a little strange [and even disquieting] toboth Cal and me—see what you think. If nothing else, it may serve to amuse youwhile you battle the mosquitoes!Two days after I mailed my last to you, a group of four young ladies arrivedfrom the Corners under the supervision of an elderly lady of intimidatinglycompetent visage named Mrs. Cloris, to set the place in order and to remove someof the dust that had been causing me to sneeze seemingly at every other step.They all seemed a little nervous as they went about their chores; indeed, oneflighty miss uttered a small screech when I entered the upstairs parlour as shedusted.I asked Mrs. Cloris about this [she was dusting the downstairs hall with grimdetermination that would have quite amazed you, her hair done up in an old fadedbandanna], and she turned to me and said with an air of determination: “Theydon’t like the house, and I don’t like the house, sir, because it has alwaysbeen a bad house.”My jaw dropped at this unexpected bit, and she went on in a kindlier tone: “I donot mean to say that Stephen Boone was not a fine man, for he was; I cleaned forhim every second Thursday all the time he was here, as I cleaned for his father,Mr. Randolph Boone, until he and his wife disappeared in eighteen and sixteen.Mr. Stephen was a good and kindly man, and so you seem, sir (if you will pardonmy bluntness; I know no other way to speak), but the house is bad and it alwayshas been, and no Boone has ever been happy here since your grandfather Robertand his brother Philip fell out over stolen [and here she paused, almostguiltily] items in seventeen and eighty-nine.”Such memories these folks have, Bones!Mrs. Cloris continued: “The house was built in unhappiness, has been lived inwith unhappiness, there has been blood spilt on its floors [as you may or maynot know, Bones, my Uncle Randolph was involved in an accident on the cellarstairs which took the life of his daughter Marcella; he then took his own lifein a fit of remorse. The incident is related in one of Stephen’s letters to me,on the sad occasion of his dead sister’s birthday], there has been disappearanceand accident.“I have worked here, Mr. Boone, and I am neither blind nor deaf. I’ve heardawful sounds in the walls, sir, awful sounds—thumpings and crashings and once astrange wailing that was half-laughter. It fair made my blood curdle. It’s adark place, sir.” And there she halted, perhaps afraid she had spoken too much.As for myself, I hardly knew whether to be offended or amused, curious or merelymatter-of-fact. I’m afraid that amusement won the day. “And what do you suspect,Mrs. Cloris? Ghosts rattling chains?”But she only looked at me oddly. “Ghosts there may be. But it’s not ghosts inthe walls. It’s not ghosts that wail and blubber like the damned and crash andblunder away in the darkness. It’s—”“Come, Mrs. Cloris,” I prompted her. “You’ve come this far. Now can you finishwhat you’ve begun?”The strangest expression of terror, pique, and—I would swear to it—religious awepassed over her face. “Some die not,” she whispered. “Some live in the twilightshadows Between to serve—Him!”And that was the end. For some minutes I continued to tax her, but she grew onlymore obstinate and would say no more. At last I desisted, fearing she mightgather herself up and quit the premises.This is the end of one episode, but a second occurred the following evening.Calvin had laid a fire downstairs and I was sitting in the living-room, drowsingover a copy of The Intelligencer and listening to the sound of wind-driven rainon the large bay window. I felt comfortable as only one can on such a night,when all is miserable outside and all is warmth and comfort inside; but a momentlater Calvin appeared at the door, looking excited and a bit nervous.“Are you awake, sir?” he asked.“Barely,” I said. “What is it?”“I’ve found something upstairs I think you should see,” he responded, with thesame air of suppressed excitement.I got up and followed him. As we climbed the wide stairs, Calvin said: “I wasreading a book in the upstairs study—a rather strange one—when I heard a noisein the wall.”“Rats,” I said. “Is that all?”He paused on the landing, looking at me solemnly. The lamp he held cast weird,lurking shadows on the dark draperies and on the half-seen portraits that seemednow to leer rather than smile. Outside the wind rose to a brief scream and thensubsided grudgingly.“Not rats,” Cal said. “There was a kind of blundering, thudding sound frombehind the book-cases, and then a horrible gurgling—horrible, sir. Andscratching, as if something were struggling to get out … to get at me!”You can imagine my amazement, Bones. Calvin is not the type to give way tohysterical flights of imagination. It began to seem that there was a mysteryhere after all—and perhaps an ugly one indeed.“What then?” I asked him. We had resumed down the hall, and I could see thelight from the study spilling forth onto the floor of the gallery. I viewed itwith some trepidation; the night seemed no longer comfortable.“The scratching noise stopped. After a moment the thudding, shuffling soundsbegan again, this time moving away from me. It paused once, and I swear I hearda strange, almost inaudible laugh! I went to the book-case and began to push andpull, thinking there might be a partition, or a secret door.”“You found one?”Cal paused at the door to the study. “No—but I found this!”We stepped in and I saw a square black hole in the left case. The books at thatpoint were nothing but dummies, and what Cal had found was a small hiding place.I flashed my lamp within it and saw nothing but a thick fall of dust, dust whichmust have been decades old.“There was only this,” Cal said quietly, and handed me a yellowed foolscap. Thething was a map, drawn in spider-thin strokes of black ink—the map of a town orvillage. There were perhaps seven buildings, and one, clearly marked with asteeple, bore this legend beneath it: The Worm That Doth Corrupt.In the upper left corner, to what would have been the northwest of this littlevillage, an arrow pointed. Inscribed beneath it: Chapelwaite.Calvin said: “In town, sir, someone rather superstitiously mentioned a desertedvillage called Jerusalem’s Lot. It’s a place they steer clear of.”“But this?” I asked, fingering the odd legend below the steeple.“I don’t know.”A memory of Mrs. Cloris, adamant yet fearful, passed through my mind. “TheWorm …” I muttered.“Do you know something, Mr. Boone?”“Perhaps … it might be amusing to have a look for this town tomorrow, do youthink, Cal?”He nodded, eyes lighting. We spent almost an hour after this looking for somebreach in the wall behind the cubby-hole Cal had found, but with no success. Norwas there a recurrence of the noises Cal had described.We retired with no further adventure that night.On the following morning Calvin and I set out on our ramble through the woods.The rain of the night before had ceased, but the sky was somber and lowering. Icould see Cal looking at me with some doubtfulness and I hastened to reassurehim that should I tire, or the journey prove too far, I would not hesitate tocall a halt to the affair. We had equipped ourselves with a picnic lunch, a fineBuckwhite compass, and, of course, the odd and ancient map of Jerusalem’s Lot.It was a strange and brooding day; not a bird seemed to sing nor an animal tomove as we made our way through the great and gloomy stands of pine to the southand east. The only sounds were those of our own feet and the steady pound of theAtlantic against the headlands. The smell of the sea, almost preternaturallyheavy, was our constant companion.We had gone no more than two miles when we struck an overgrown road of what Ibelieve were once called the “corduroy” variety; this tended in our generaldirection and we struck off along it, making brisk time. We spoke little. Theday, with its still and ominous quality, weighed heavily on our spirits.At about eleven o’clock we heard the sound of rushing water. The remnant of roadtook a hard turn to the left, and on the other side of a boiling, slaty littlestream, like an apparition, was Jerusalem’s Lot!The stream was perhaps eight feet across, spanned by a moss-grown footbridge. Onthe far side, Bones, stood the most perfect little village you might imagine,understandably weathered, but amazingly preserved. Several houses, done in thataustere yet commanding form for which the Puritans were justly famous, stoodclustered near the steeply sheared bank. Further beyond, along a weed-grownthoroughfare, stood three or four of what might have been primitive businessestablishments, and beyond that, the spire of the church marked on the map,rising up to the gray sky and looking grim beyond description with its peeledpaint and tarnished, leaning cross.“The town is well named,” Cal said softly beside me.We crossed to the town and began to poke through it—and this is where my storygrows slightly amazing, Bones, so prepare yourself!The air seemed leaden as we walked among the buildings; weighted, if you will.The edifices were in a state of decay—shutters torn off, roofs crumbled underthe weight of heavy snows gone by, windows dusty and leering. Shadows from oddcorners and warped angles seemed to sit in sinister pools.We entered an old rotting tavern first—somehow it did not seem right that weshould invade any of those houses to which people had retired when they wishedprivacy. An old weather-scrubbed sign above the splintered door announced thatthis had been the BOAR’S HEAD INN AND TAVERN. The door creaked hellishly on itsone remaining hinge, and we stepped into the shadowed interior. The smell of rotand mould was vaporous and nearly overpowering. And beneath it seemed to lie aneven deeper smell, a slimy and pestiferous smell, a smell of ages and the decayof ages. Such a stench as might issue from corrupt coffins or violated tombs. Iheld my handkerchief to my nose and Cal did likewise. We surveyed the place.“My God, sir—” Cal said faintly.“It’s never been touched,” I finished for him.As indeed it had not. Tables and chairs stood about like ghostly guardians ofthe watch, dusty, warped by the extreme changes in temperature which the NewEngland climate is known for, but otherwise perfect—as if they had waitedthrough the silent, echoing decades for those long gone to enter once more, tocall for a pint or a dram, to deal cards and light clay pipes. A small squaremirror hung beside the rules of the tavern, unbroken. Do you see thesignificance, Bones? Small boys are noted for exploration and vandalism; thereis not a “haunted” house which stands with windows intact, no matter howfearsome the eldritch inhabitants are rumoured to be; not a shadowy graveyardwithout at least one tombstone upended by young pranksters. Certainly there mustbe a score of young pranksters in Preacher’s Corners, not two miles fromJerusalem’s Lot. Yet the inn-keeper’s glass [which must have cost him a nicesum] was intact—as were the other fragile items we found in our pokings. Theonly damage in Jerusalem’s Lot has been done by impersonal Nature. Theimplication is obvious: Jerusalem’s Lot is a shunned town. But why? I have anotion, but before I even dare hint at it, I must proceed to the unsettlingconclusion of our visit.We went up to the sleeping quarters and found beds made up, pewterwater-pitchers neatly placed beside them. The kitchen was likewise untouched byanything save the dust of the years and that horrible, sunken stench of decay.The tavern alone would be an antiquarian’s paradise; the wondrously queerkitchen stove alone would fetch a pretty price at Boston auction.“What do you think, Cal?” I asked when we had emerged again into the uncertaindaylight.“I think it’s bad business, Mr. Boone,” he replied in his doleful way, “and thatwe must see more to know more.”We gave the other shops scant notice—there was a hostelry with moulderingleather goods still hung on rusted flatnails, a chandler’s, a warehouse with oakand pine still stacked within, a smithy.We entered two houses as we made our way toward the church at the center of thevillage. Both were perfectly in the Puritan mode, full of items a collectorwould give his arm for, both deserted and full of the same rotten scent.Nothing seemed to live or move in all of this but ourselves. We saw no insects,no birds, not even a cobweb fashioned in a window corner. Only dust.At last we reached the church. It reared above us, grim, uninviting, cold. Itswindows were black with the shadows inside, and any Godliness or sanctity haddeparted from it long ago. Of that I am certain. We mounted the steps, and Iplaced my hand on the large iron door-pull. A set, dark look passed from myselfto Calvin and back again. I opened the portal. How long since the door had beentouched? I would say with confidence that mine was the first in fifty years;perhaps longer. Rust-clogged hinges screamed as I opened it. The smell of rotand decay which smote us was nearly palpable. Cal made a gagging sound in histhroat and twisted his head involuntarily for clearer air.“Sir,” he asked, “are you sure that you are—?”“I’m fine,” I said calmly. But I did not feel calm, Bones, no more than I donow. I believe, with Moses, with Jereboam, with Increase Mather, and with ourown Hanson [when he is in a philosophical temperament], that there arespiritually noxious places, buildings where the milk of the cosmos has becomesour and rancid. This church is such a place; I would swear to it.We stepped into a long vestibule equipped with a dusty coat rack and shelvedhymnals. It was windowless. Oil-lamps stood in niches here and there. Anunremarkable room, I thought, until I heard Calvin’s sharp gasp and saw what hehad already noticed.It was an obscenity.I daren’t describe that elaborately framed picture further than this: that itwas done after the fleshy style of Rubens; that it contained a grotesquetravesty of a madonna and child; that strange, half-shadowed creatures sportedand crawled in the background.“Lord,” I whispered.“There’s no Lord here,” Calvin said, and his words seemed to hang in the air. Iopened the door leading into the church itself, and the odour became a miasma,nearly overpowering.In the glimmering half-light of afternoon the pews stretched ghostlike to thealtar. Above them was a high, oaken pulpit and a shadow-struck narthex fromwhich gold glimmered.With a half-sob Calvin, that devout Protestant, made the Holy Sign, and Ifollowed suit. For the gold was a large, beautifully wrought cross—but it washung upside-down, symbol of Satan’s Mass.“We must be calm,” I heard myself saying. “We must be calm, Calvin. We must becalm.”But a shadow had touched my heart, and I was afraid as I had never been. I havewalked beneath death’s umbrella and thought there was none darker. But there is.There is.We walked down the aisle, our footfalls echoing above and around us. We lefttracks in the dust. And at the altar there were other tenebrous objets d’art. Iwill not, cannot, let my mind dwell upon them.I began to mount to the pulpit itself.“Don’t, Mr. Boone!” Cal cried suddenly. “I’m afraid—”But I had gained it. A huge book lay open upon the stand, writ both in Latin andcrabbed runes which looked, to my unpractised eye, either Druidic or pre-Celtic.I enclose a card with several of the symbols, redrawn from memory.I closed the book and looked at the words stamped into the leather: De VermisMysteriis. My Latin is rusty, but serviceable enough to translate: The Mysteriesof the Worm.As I touched it, that accursed church and Calvin’s white, upturned face seemedto swim before me. It seemed that I heard low, chanting voices, full of hideousyet eager fear—and below that sound, another, filling the bowels of the earth.An hallucination, I doubt it not—but at the same moment, the church was filledwith a very real sound, which I can only describe as a huge and macabre turningbeneath my feet. The pulpit trembled beneath my fingers; the desecrated crosstrembled on the wall.We exited together, Cal and I, leaving the place to its own darkness, andneither of us dared look back until we had crossed the rude planks spanning thestream. I will not say we defiled the nineteen hundred years man has spentclimbing upward from a hunkering and superstitious savage by actually running;but I would be a liar to say that we strolled.That is my tale. You mustn’t shadow your recovery by fearing that the fever hastouched me again; Cal can attest to all in these pages, up to and including thehideous noise.So I close, saying only that I wish I might see you [knowing that much of mybewilderment would drop away immediately], and that I remain your friend andadmirer,CHARLES.Oct. 17, 1850.DEAR GENTLEMEN:In the most recent edition of your catalogue of household items (i.e., Summer,1850), I noticed a preparation which is titled Rat’s Bane. I should like topurchase one (1) 5-pound tin of this preparation at your stated price of thirtycents ($.30). I enclose return postage. Please mail to: Calvin McCann,Chapelwaite, Preacher’s Corners, Cumberland County, Maine.Thank you for your attention in this matter.I remain, dear Gentlemen,CALVIN McCANN.Oct. 19, 1850.DEAR BONES,Developments of a disquieting nature.The noises in the house have intensified, and I am growing more to theconclusion that rats are not all that move within our walls. Calvin and I wenton another fruitless search for hidden crannies or passages, but found nothing.How poorly we would fit into one of Mrs. Radcliffe’s romances! Cal claims,however, that much of the sound emanates from the cellar, and it is there weintend to explore tomorrow. It makes me no easier to know that Cousin Stephen’ssister met her unfortunate end there.Her portrait, by the by, hangs in the upstairs gallery. Marcella Boone was asadly pretty thing, if the artist got her right, and I do know she nevermarried. At times I think that Mrs. Cloris was right, that it is a bad house. Ithas certainly held nothing but gloom for its past inhabitants.But I have more to say of the redoubtable Mrs. Cloris, for I have had this day asecond interview with her. As the most level-headed person from the Corners thatI have met thus far, I sought her out this afternoon, after an unpleasantinterview which I will relate.The wood was to have been delivered this morning, and when noon came and passedand no wood with it, I decided to take my daily walk into the town itself. Myobject was to visit Thompson, the man with whom Cal did business.It has been a lovely day, full of the crisp snap of bright autumn, and by thetime I reached the Thompsons’ homestead [Cal, who remained home to poke furtherthrough Uncle Stephen’s library, gave me adequate directions] I felt in the bestmood that these last few days have seen, and quite prepared to forgiveThompson’s tardiness with the wood.The place was a massive tangle of weeds and fallen-down buildings in need ofpaint; to the left of the barn a huge sow, ready for November butchering,grunted and wallowed in a muddy sty, and in the littered yard between the houseand out-buildings a woman in a tattered gingham dress was feeding chickens fromher apron. When I hailed her, she turned a pale and vapid face toward me.The sudden change in expression from utter, doltish emptiness to one of frenziedterror was quite wonderful to behold. I can only think she took me for Stephenhimself, for she raised her hand in the prong-fingered sign of the evil eye andscreamed. The chickenfeed scattered on the ground and the fowls fluttered away,squawking.Before I could utter a sound, a huge, hulking figure of a man clad only inlong-handled underwear lumbered out of the house with a squirrel-rifle in onehand and a jug in the other. From the red light in his eye and unsteady mannerof walking, I judged that this was Thompson the Woodcutter himself.“A Boone!” he roared. “G— d—n your eyes!” He dropped the jug a-rolling and alsomade the Sign.“I’ve come,” I said with as much equanimity as I could muster under thecircumstances, “because the wood has not. According to the agreement you struckwith my man—”“G— d—n your man too, say I!” And for the first time I noticed that beneath hisbluff and bluster he was deadly afraid. I began seriously to wonder if hemightn’t actually use his rifle against me in his excitement.I began carefully: “As a gesture of courtesy, you might—”“G— d—n your courtesy!”“Very well, then,” I said with as much dignity as I could muster. “I bid yougood day until you are more in control of yourself.” And with this I turned awayand began down the road to the village.“Don’tchee come back!” he screamed after me. “Stick wi’ your evil up there!Cursed! Cursed! Cursed!” He pelted a stone at me, which struck my shoulder. Iwould not give him the satisfaction of dodging.So I sought out Mrs. Cloris, determined to solve the mystery of Thompson’senmity, at least. She is a widow [and none of your confounded matchmaking,Bones; she is easily fifteen years my senior, and I’ll not see forty again] andlives by herself in a charming little cottage at the ocean’s very doorstep. Ifound the lady hanging out her wash, and she seemed genuinely pleased to see me.I found this a great relief; it is vexing almost beyond words to be brandedpariah for no understandable reason.“Mr. Boone,” said she, offering a half-curtsey. “If you’ve come about washing, Itake none in past September. My rheumatiz pains me so that it’s trouble enoughto do my own.”“I wish laundry was the subject of my visit. I’ve come for help, Mrs. Cloris. Imust know all you can tell me about Chapelwaite and Jerusalem’s Lot and why thetownsfolk regard me with such fear and suspicion!”“Jerusalem’s Lot! You know about that, then.”“Yes,” I replied, “and visited it with my companion a week ago.”“God!” She went pale as milk, and tottered. I put out a hand to steady her. Hereyes rolled horribly, and for a moment I was sure she would swoon.“Mrs. Cloris, I am sorry if I have said anything to—”“Come inside,” she said. “You must know. Sweet Jesu, the evil days have comeagain!”She would not speak more until she had brewed strong tea in her sunshinykitchen. When it was before us, she looked pensively out at the ocean for atime. Inevitably, her eyes and mine were drawn to the jutting brow ofChapelwaite Head, where the house looked out over the water. The large baywindow glittered in the rays of the westering sun like a diamond. The view wasbeautiful but strangely disturbing. She suddenly turned to me and declaredvehemently:“Mr. Boone, you must leave Chapelwaite immediately!”I was flabbergasted.“There has been an evil breath in the air since you took up residence. In thelast week—since you set foot in the accursed place—there have been omens andportents. A caul over the face of the moon; flocks of whippoorwills which roostin the cemeteries; an unnatural birth. You must leave!”When I found my tongue, I spoke as gently as I could. “Mrs. Cloris, these thingsare dreams. You must know that.”“Is it a dream that Barbara Brown gave birth to a child with no eyes? Or thatClifton Brockett found a flat, pressed trail five feet wide in the woods beyondChapelwaite where all had withered and gone white? And can you, who have visitedJerusalem’s Lot, say with truth that nothing still lives there?”I could not answer; the scene in that hideous church sprang before my eyes.She clamped her gnarled hands together in an effort to calm herself. “I know ofthese things only from my mother and her mother before her. Do you know thehistory of your family as it applies to Chapelwaite?”“Vaguely,” I said. “The house has been the home of Philip Boone’s line since the1780s; his brother Robert, my grandfather, located in Massachusetts after anargument over stolen papers. Of Philip’s side I know little, except that anunhappy shadow fell over it, extending from father to son tograndchildren—Marcella died in a tragic accident and Stephen fell to his death.It was his wish that Chapelwaite become the home of me and mine, and that thefamily rift thus be mended.”“Never to be mended,” she whispered. “You know nothing of the original quarrel?”“Robert Boone was discovered rifling his brother’s desk.”“Philip Boone was mad,” she said. “A man who trafficked with the unholy. Thething which Robert Boone attempted to remove was a profane Bible writ in the oldtongues—Latin, Druidic, others. A hell-book.”“De Vermis Mysteriis.”She recoiled as if struck. “You know of it?”“I have seen it … touched it.” It seemed again she might swoon. A hand went toher mouth as if to stifle an outcry. “Yes; in Jerusalem’s Lot. On the pulpit ofa corrupt and desecrated church.”“Still there; still there, then.” She rocked in her chair. “I had hoped God inHis wisdom had cast it into the pit of hell.”“What relation had Philip Boone to Jerusalem’s Lot?”“Blood relation,” she said darkly. “The Mark of the Beast was on him, althoughhe walked in the clothes of the Lamb. And on the night of October 31, 1789,Philip Boone disappeared … and the entire populace of that damned village withhim.”She would say little more; in fact, seemed to know little more. She would onlyreiterate her plea that I leave, giving as reason something about “blood callingto blood” and muttering about “those who watch and those who guard.” As twilightdrew on she seemed to grow more agitated rather than less, and to placate her Ipromised that her wishes would be taken under strong consideration.I walked home through lengthening, gloomy shadows, my good mood quite dissipatedand my head spinning with questions which still plague me. Cal greeted me withthe news that our noises in the walls have grown worse still—as I can attest atthis moment. I try to tell myself that I hear only rats, but then I see theterrified, earnest face of Mrs. Cloris.The moon has risen over the sea, bloated, full, the colour of blood, stainingthe ocean with a noxious shade. My mind turns to that church again and(here a line is struck out)But you shall not see that, Bones. It is too mad. It is time I slept, I think.My thoughts go out to you.Regards,CHARLES.(The following is from the pocket journal of Calvin McCann.)Oct. 20, ’50Took the liberty this morning of forcing the lock which binds the book closed;did it before Mr. Boone arose. No help; it is all in cypher. A simple one, Ibelieve. Perhaps I may break it as easily as the lock. A diary, I am certain,the hand oddly like Mr. Boone’s own. Whose book, shelved in the most obscurecorner of this library and locked across the pages? It seems old, but how totell? The corrupting air has largely been kept from its pages. More later, iftime; Mr. Boone set upon looking about the cellar. Am afraid these dreadfulgoings-on will be too much for his chancy health yet. I must try to persuadehim—But he comes.Oct. 20, 1850.BONES,I can’t write I cant [sic] write of this yet I I I(From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann)Oct. 20, ’50As I had feared, his health has broken—Dear God, our Father Who art in Heaven!Cannot bear to think of it; yet it is planted, burned on my brain like atin-type; that horror in the cellar—!Alone now; half-past eight o’clock; house silent but—Found him swooned over his writing table; he still sleeps; yet for those fewmoments how nobly he acquitted himself while I stood paralyzed and shattered!His skin is waxy, cool. Not the fever again, God be thanks. I daren’t move himor leave him to go to the village. And if I did go, who would return with me toaid him? Who would come to this cursed house?O, the cellar! The things in the cellar that have haunted our walls!Oct. 22, 1850.DEAR BONES,I am myself again, although weak, after thirty-six hours of unconsciousness.Myself again … what a grim and bitter joke! I shall never be myself again,never. I have come face to face with an insanity and a horror beyond the limitsof human expression. And the end is not yet.If it were not for Cal, I believe I should end my life this minute. He is oneisland of sanity in all this madness.You shall know it all.We had equipped ourselves with candles for our cellar exploration, and theythrew a strong glow that was quite adequate—hellishly adequate! Calvin tried todissuade me, citing my recent illness, saying that the most we should probablyfind would be some healthy rats to mark for poisoning.I remained determined, however; Calvin fetched a sign and answered: “Have it asyou must, then, Mr. Boone.”The entrance to the cellar is by means of a trap in the kitchen floor [which Calassures me he has since stoutly boarded over], and we raised it only with agreat deal of straining and lifting.A foetid, overpowering smell came up out of the darkness, not unlike that whichpervaded the deserted town across the Royal River. The candle I held shed itsglow on a steeply slanting flight of stairs leading down into darkness. Theywere in a terrible state of repair—in one place an entire riser was missing,leaving only a black hole—and it was easy enough to see how the unfortunateMarcella might have come to her end there.“Be careful, Mr. Boone!” Cal said; I told him I had no intention of beinganything but, and we made the descent.The floor was earthen, the walls of stout granite, and hardly wet. The place didnot look like a rat haven at all, for there were none of the things rats like tomake their nests in, such as old boxes, discarded furniture, piles of paper, andthe like. We lifted our candles, gaining a small circle of light, but still ableto see little. The floor had a gradual slope which seemed to run beneath themain living-room and the dining-room—i.e., to the west. It was in this directionwe walked. All was in utter silence. The stench in the air grew steadilystronger, and the dark about us seemed to press like wool, as if jealous of thelight which had temporarily deposed it after so many years of undisputeddominion.At the far end, the granite walls gave way to a polished wood which seemedtotally black and without reflective properties. Here the cellar ended, leavingwhat seemed to be an alcove off the main chamber. It was positioned at an anglewhich made inspection impossible without stepping around the corner.Calvin and I did so.It was as if a rotten spectre of this dwelling’s sinister past had risen beforeus. A single chair stood in this alcove, and above it, fastened from a hook inone of the stout overhead beams, was a decayed noose of hemp.“Then it was here that he hung himself,” Calvin muttered. “God!”“Yes … with the corpse of his daughter lying at the foot of the stairs behindhim.”Cal began to speak; then I saw his eyes jerked to a spot behind me; then hiswords became a scream.How, Bones, can I describe the sight which fell upon our eyes? How can I tellyou of the hideous tenants within our walls?The far wall swung back, and from that darkness a face leered—a face with eyesas ebon as the Styx itself. Its mouth yawned in a toothless, agonized grin; oneyellow, rotted hand stretched itself out to us. It made a hideous, mewling soundand took a shambling step forward. The light from my candle fell upon it—And I saw the livid rope-burn about its neck!From beyond it something else moved, something I shall dream of until the daywhen all dreams cease: a girl with a pallid, mouldering face and a corpse-grin;a girl whose head lolled at a lunatic angle.They wanted us; I know it. And I know they would have drawn us into thatdarkness and made us their own, had I not thrown my candle directly at the thingin the partition, and followed it with the chair beneath that noose.After that, all is confused darkness. My mind has drawn the curtain. I awoke, asI have said, in my room with Cal at my side.If I could leave, I should fly from this house of horror with my nightdressflapping at my heels. But I cannot. I have become a pawn in a deeper, darkerdrama. Do not ask how I know; I only do. Mrs. Cloris was right when she spoke ofblood calling to blood; and how horribly right when she spoke of those who watchand those who guard. I fear that I have wakened a Force which has slept in thetenebrous village of ’Salem’s Lot for half a century, a Force which has slain myancestors and taken them in unholy bondage as nosferatu—the Undead. And I havegreater fears than these, Bones, but I still see only in part. If I knew … if Ionly knew all!CHARLES.Postscriptum—And of course I write this only for myself; we are isolated fromPreacher’s Corners. I daren’t carry my taint there to post this, and Calvin willnot leave me. Perhaps, if God is good, this will reach you in some manner. C.(From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann)Oct. 23, ’50He is stronger to-day; we talked briefly of the apparitions in the cellar;agreed they were neither hallucinations or of an ectoplasmic origin, but real.Does Mr. Boone suspect, as I do, that they have gone? Perhaps; the noises arestill; yet all is ominous yet, o’ercast with a dark pall. It seems we wait inthe deceptive Eye of the Storm.…Have found a packet of papers in an upstairs bedroom, lying in the bottom drawerof an old roll-top desk. Some correspondence & receipted bills lead me tobelieve the room was Robert Boone’s. Yet the most interesting document is a fewjottings on the back of an advertisement for gentlemen’s beaver hats. At the topis writ:Blessed are the meek.Below, the following apparent nonsense is writ:b k e d s h d e r m t h e s e a ke l m s o e r a r e s h a m d e dI believe ’tis the key of the locked and coded book in the library. The cypherabove is certainly a rustic one used in the War for Independence known as theFence-Rail. When one removes the “nulls” from the second bit of scribble, thefollowing is obtained:b e s d r t e e kl s e a e h m eRead up and down rather than across, the result is the original quotation fromthe Beatitudes.Before I dare show this to Mr. Boone, I must be sure of the book’s contents.…Oct. 24, 1850.DEAR BONES,An amazing occurrence—Cal, always close-mouthed until absolutely sure of himself[a rare and admirable human trait], has found the diary of my grandfatherRobert. The document was in a code which Cal himself has broken. He modestlydeclares that the discovery was an accident, but I suspect that perseverance andhard work had rather more to do with it.At any rate, what a somber light it sheds on our mysteries here!The first entry is dated June 1, 1789, the last October 27, 1789—four daysbefore the cataclysmic disappearance of which Mrs. Cloris spoke. It tells a taleof deepening obsession—nay, of madness—and makes hideously clear therelationship between Great-Uncle Philip, the town of Jerusalem’s Lot, and thebook which rests in that desecrated church.The town itself, according to Robert Boone, pre-dates Chapelwaite (built in1782) and Preacher’s Corners (known in those days as Preacher’s Rest and foundedin 1741); it was founded by a splinter group of the Puritan faith in 1710, asect headed by a dour religious fanatic named James Boon. What a start that namegave me! That this Boon bore relation to my family can hardly be doubted, Ibelieve. Mrs. Cloris could not have been more right in her superstitious beliefthat familial blood-line is of crucial importance in this matter; and I recallwith terror her answer to my question about Philip and his relationship to’Salem’s Lot. “Blood relation,” said she, and I fear that it is so.The town became a settled community built around the church where Boonpreached—or held court. My grandfather intimates that he also held commerce withany number of ladies from the town, assuring them that this was God’s way andwill. As a result, the town became an anomaly which could only have existed inthose isolated and queer days when belief in witches and the Virgin Birthexisted hand in hand: an interbred, rather degenerate religious villagecontrolled by a half-mad preacher whose twin gospels were the Bible and deGoudge’s sinister Demon Dwellings; a community in which rites of exorcism wereheld regularly; a community of incest and the insanity and physical defectswhich so often accompany that sin. I suspect [and believe Robert Boone must havealso] that one of Boon’s bastard offspring must have left [or have been spiritedaway from] Jerusalem’s Lot to seek his fortune to the south—and thus founded ourpresent lineage. I do know, by my own family reckoning, that our clan supposedlyoriginated in that part of Massachusetts which has so lately become thisSovereign State of Maine. My great-grandfather, Kenneth Boone, became a rich manas a result of the then-flourishing fur trade. It was his money, increased bytime and wise investment, which built this ancestral home long after his deathin 1763. His sons, Philip and Robert, built Chapelwaite. Blood calls to blood,Mrs. Cloris said. Could it be that Kenneth was born of James Boon, fled themadness of his father and his father’s town, only to have his sons,all-unknowing, build the Boone home not two miles from the Boon beginnings? If’tis true, does it not seem that some huge and invisible Hand has guided us?According to Robert’s diary, James Boon was ancient in 1789—and he must havebeen. Granting him an age of twenty-five in the year of the town’s founding, hewould have been one hundred and four, a prodigious age. The following is quoteddirect from Robert Boone’s diary:August 4, 1789.To-day for the first time I met this Man with whom my Brother has been sounhealthily taken; I must admit this Boon controls a strange Magnetism whichupset me Greatly. He is a veritable Ancient, white-bearded, and dresses in ablack Cassock which struck me as somehow obscene. More disturbing yet was theFact that he was surrounded by Women, as a Sultan would be surrounded by hisHarem; and P. assures me he is active yet, although at least an Octogenarian.…The Village itself I had visited only once before, and will not visit again; itsStreets are silent and filled with the Fear the old Man inspires from hisPulpit: I fear also that Like has mated with Like, as so many of the Faces aresimilar. It seemed that each way I turned I beheld the old Man’s Visage … allare so wan; they seem Lack-Luster, as if sucked dry of all Vitality, I beheldEyeless and Noseless Children, Women who wept and gibbered and pointed at theSky for no Reason, and garbled talk from the Scriptures with talk of Demons;…P. wished me to stay for Services, but the thought of that sinister Ancient inthe Pulpit before an Audience of this Town’s interbred Populace repulsed me andI made an Excuse.…The entries preceding and following this tell of Philip’s growing fascinationwith James Boon. On September 1, 1789, Philip was baptized into Boon’s church.His brother says: “I am aghast with Amaze and Horror—my Brother has changedbefore my very Eyes—he even seems to grow to resemble the wretched Man.”First mention of the book occurs on July 23. Robert’s diary records it onlybriefly: “P. returned from the smaller Village tonight with, I thought, a ratherwild Visage. Would not speak until Bed-time, when he said that Boon had enquiredafter a Book titled Mysteries of the Worm. To please P. I promised to writeJohns & Goodfellow a letter of enquiry; P. almost fawningly Grateful.”On August 12, this notation: “Rec’d two Letters in the Post today … one fromJohns & Goodfellow in Boston. They have Note of the Tome in which P. hasexpressed an Interest. Only five Copies extant in this Country. The Letter israther cool; odd indeed. Have known Henry Goodfellow for Years.”August 13:P. insanely excited by Goodfellow’s letter; refuses to say why. He would onlysay that Boon is exceedingly anxious to obtain a Copy. Cannot think why, sinceby the Title it seems only a harmless gardening Treatise.…Am worried for Philip; he grows stranger to me Daily. I wish now we had notreturned to Chapelwaite. The Summer is hot, oppressive, and filled with Omens.…There are only two further mentions of the infamous book in Robert’s diary [heseems not to have realized the true importance of it, even at the end]. From theentry of September 4:I have petitioned Goodfellow to act as P.’s Agent in the matter of the Purchase,although my better Judgement cries against It. What use to demur? Has he not hisown Money, should I refuse? And in return I have extracted a Promise from Philipto recant this noisome Baptism … yet he is so Hectic; nearly Feverish; I do nottrust him. I am hopelessly at Sea in this Matter.…Finally, September 16:The Book arrived to-day, with a note from Goodfellow saying he wishes no more ofmy Trade.… P. was excited to an unnatural Degree; all but snatched the Book frommy Hands. It is writ in bastard Latin and a Runic Script of which I can readNothing. The Thing seemed almost warm to the Touch, and to vibrate in my Hands,as if it contained a huge Power.… I reminded P. of his Promise to Recant and heonly laughed in an ugly, crazed Fashion and waved that Book in my Face, cryingover and over again: “We have it! We have it! The Worm! The Secret of the Worm!”He is now fled, I suppose to his mad Benefactor, and I have not seen him morethis Day.…Of the book there is no more, but I have made certain deductions which seem atleast probable. First, that this book was, as Mrs. Cloris has said, the subjectof the falling-out between Robert and Philip; second, that it is a repository ofunholy incantation, possibly of Druidic origin [many of the Druidicblood-rituals were preserved in print by the Roman conquerors of Britain in thename of scholarship, and many of these infernal cook-books are among the world’sforbidden literature]; third, that Boon and Philip intended to use the book fortheir own ends. Perhaps, in some twisted way, they intended good, but I do notbelieve it. I believe they had long before bound themselves over to whateverfaceless powers exist beyond the rim of the Universe; powers which may existbeyond the very fabric of Time. The last entries of Robert Boone’s diary lend adim glow of approbation to these speculations, and I allow them to speak forthemselves:October 26, 1789A terrific Babble in Preacher’s Corners to-day; Frawley, the Blacksmith, seizedmy Arm and demanded to know “What your Brother and that mad Antichrist are intoup there.” Goody Randall claims there have been Signs in the Sky of greatimpending Disaster. A Cow has been born with two Heads.As for Myself, I know not what impends; perhaps ’tis my Brother’s Insanity. HisHair has gone Gray almost Overnight, his Eyes are great bloodshot Circles fromwhich the pleasing light of Sanity seems to have departed. He grins andwhispers, and, for some Reason of his Own, has begun to haunt our Cellar whennot in Jerusalem’s Lot. The Whippoorwills congregate about the House and uponthe Grass; their combined Calling from the Mist blends with the Sea into anunearthly Shriek that precludes all thought of Sleep.October 27, 1789Followed P. this Evening when he departed for Jerusalem’s Lot, keeping a safeDistance to avoid Discovery. The cursed Whippoorwills flock through the Woods,filling all with a deathly, psychopompotic Chant. I dared not cross the Bridge;the Town all dark except for the Church, which was litten with a ghastly redGlare that seemed to transform the high, peak’d Windows into the Eyes of theInferno. Voices rose and fell in a Devil’s Litany, sometimes laughing, sometimessobbing. The very Ground seem’d to swell and groan beneath me, as if it bore anawful Weight, and I fled, amazd and full of Terror, the hellish, screaming Criesof the Whippoorwills dinning in my ears as I ran through those shadow-rivenWoods.All tends to the Climax, yet unforeseen. I dare not sleep for the Dreams thatcome, yet not remain awake for what lunatic Terrors may come. The night is fullof awful Sounds and I fear— And yet I feel the urge to go again, to watch, tosee. It seems that Philip himself calls me, and the old Man.The Birdscursed cursed cursedHere the diary of Robert Boone ends.Yet you must notice, Bones, near the conclusion, that he claims Philip himselfseemed to call him. My final conclusion is formed by these lines, by the talk ofMrs. Cloris and the others, but most of all by those terrifying figures in thecellar, dead yet alive. Our line is yet an unfortunate one, Bones. There is acurse over us which refuses to be buried; it lives a hideous shadow-life in thishouse and that town. And the culmination of the cycle is drawing close again. Iam the last of the Boone blood. I fear that something knows this, and that I amat the nexus of an evil endeavour beyond all sane understanding. The anniversaryis All Saints’ Eve, one week from today.How shall I proceed? If only you were here to counsel me, to help me! If onlyyou were here!I must know all; I must return to the shunned town. May God support me!CHARLES.(From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann)Oct. 25, ’50Mr. Boone has slept nearly all this day. His face is pallid and much thinner. Ifear recurrence of his fever is inevitable.While refreshing his water carafe I caught sight of two unmailed letters to Mr.Granson in Florida. He plans to return to Jerusalem’s Lot; ’twill be the killingof him if I allow it. Dare I steal away to Preacher’s Corners and hire a buggy?I must, and yet what if he wakes? If I should return and find him gone?The noises have begun in our walls again. Thank God he still sleeps! My mindshudders from the import of this.LaterI brought him his dinner on a tray. He plans on rising later, and despite hisevasions, I know what he plans; yet I go to Preacher’s Corners. Several of thesleeping-powders prescribed to him during his late illness remained with mythings; he drank one with his tea, all-unknowing. He sleeps again.To leave him with the Things that shamble behind our walls terrifies me; to lethim continue even one more day within these walls terrifies me even moregreatly. I have locked him in.Got grant he should still be there, safe and sleeping, when I return with thebuggy!Still laterStoned me! Stoned me like a wild and rabid dog! Monsters and fiends! These, thatcall themselves men! We are prisoners here—The birds, the whippoorwills, havebegun to gather.October 26, 1850.DEAR BONES,It is nearly dusk, and I have just wakened, having slept nearly the lasttwenty-four hours away. Although Cal has said nothing, I suspect he put asleeping-powder in my tea, having gleaned my intentions. He is a good andfaithful friend, intending only the best, and I shall say nothing.Yet my mind is set. Tomorrow is the day. I am calm, resolved, but also seem tofeel the subtle onset of the fever again. If it is so, it must be tomorrow.Perhaps tonight would be better still; yet not even the fires of Hell itselfcould induce me to set foot in that village by shadowlight.Should I write no more, may God bless and keep you, Bones.CHARLES.Postscriptum—The birds have set up their cry, and the horrible shuffling soundshave begun again. Cal does not think I hear, but I do.C.(From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann)Oct. 27, ’505 AMHe is impersuadable. Very well. I go with him.November 4, 1850.DEAR BONES,Weak, yet lucid. I am not sure of the date, yet my almanac assures me by tideand sunset that it must be correct. I sit at my desk, where I sat when I firstwrote you from Chapelwaite, and look out over the dark sea from which the lastof the light is rapidly fading. I shall never see more. This night is my night;I leave it for whatever shadows be.How it heaves itself at the rocks, this sea! It throws clouds of sea-foam at thedarkling sky in banners, making the floor beneath me tremble. In thewindow-glass I see my reflection, pallid as any vampire’s. I have been withoutnourishment since the twenty-seventh of October, and should have been withoutwater, had not Calvin left the carafe beside my bed on that day.O, Cal! He is no more, Bones. He is gone in my place, in the place of thiswretch with his pipestem arms and skull face who I see reflected back in thedarkened glass. And yet he may be the more fortunate; for no dreams haunt him asthey have haunted me these last days—twisted shapes that lurk in the nightmarecorridors of delirium. Even now my hands tremble; I have splotched the page withink.Calvin confronted me on that morning just as I was about to slip away—and Ithinking I had been so crafty. I had told him that I had decided we must leave,and asked him if he would go to Tandrell, some ten miles distant, and hire atrap where we were less notorious. He agreed to make the hike and I watched himleave by the sea-road. When he was out of sight I quickly made myself ready,donning both coat and muffler [for the weather had turned frosty; the firsttouch of coming winter was on that morning’s cutting breeze]. I wished brieflyfor a gun, then laughed at myself for the wish. What avails guns in such amatter?I let myself out by the pantry-way, pausing for a last look at sea and sky; forthe smell of the fresh air against the putrescence I knew I should smell soonenough; for the sight of a foraging gull wheeling below the clouds.I turned—and there stood Calvin McCann.“You shall not go alone,” he said; and his face was as grim as ever I have seenit.“But, Calvin—” I began.“No, not a word! We go together and do what we must, or I return you bodily tothe house. You are not well. You shall not go alone.”It is impossible to describe the conflicting emotions that swept over me:confusion, pique, gratefulness—yet the greatest of them was love.We made our way silently past the summer house and the sundial, down theweed-covered verge and into the woods. All was dead still—not a bird sang nor awood-cricket chirruped. The world seemed cupped in a silent pall. There was onlythe ever-present smell of salt, and from far away, the faint tang of woodsmoke.The woods were a blazoned riot of colour, but, to my eye, scarlet seemed topredominate all.Soon the scent of salt passed, and another, more sinister odour took its place;that rottenness which I have mentioned. When we came to the leaning bridge whichspanned the Royal, I expected Cal to ask me again to defer, but he did not. Hepaused, looked at that grim spire which seemed to mock the blue sky above it,and then looked at me. We went on.We proceeded with quick yet dread footsteps to James Boon’s church. The doorstill hung ajar from our latter exit, and the darkness within seemed to leer atus. As we mounted the steps, brass seemed to fill my heart; my hand trembled asit touched the door-handle and pulled it. The smell within was greater, morenoxious than ever.We stepped into the shadowy anteroom and, with no pause, into the main chamber.It was a shambles.Something vast had been at work in there, and a mighty destruction had takenplace. Pews were overturned and heaped like jackstraws. The wicked cross layagainst the east wall, and a jagged hole in the plaster above it testified tothe force with which it had been hurled. The oil-lamps had been ripped fromtheir high fixtures, and the reek of whale-oil mingled with the terrible stinkwhich pervaded the town. And down the center aisle, like a ghastly bridal path,was a trail of black ichor, mingled with sinister tendrils of blood. Our eyesfollowed it to the pulpit—the only untouched thing in view. Atop it, staring atus from across the blasphemous Book with glazed eyes, was the butchered body ofa lamb.“God,” Calvin whispered.We approached, keeping clear of the slime on the floor. The room echoed back ourfootsteps and seemed to transmute them into the sound of gigantic laughter.We mounted the narthex together. The lamb had not been torn or eaten; itappeared, rather, to have been squeezed until its blood vessels had forciblyruptured. Blood lay in thick and noisome puddles on the lectern itself, andabout the base of it … yet on the book it was transparent, and the crabbed runescould be read through it, as through coloured glass!“Must we touch it?” Cal asked, unfaltering.“Yes. I must have it.”“What will you do?”“What should have been done sixty years ago. I am going to destroy it.”We rolled the lamb’s corpse away from the book; it struck the floor with ahideous, lolling thud. The blood-stained pages now seemed alive with a scarletglow of their own.My ears began to ring and hum; a low chant seemed to emanate from the wallsthemselves. From the twisted look on Cal’s face I knew he heard the same. Thefloor beneath us trembled, as if the familiar which haunted this church came nowunto us, to protect its own. The fabric of sane space and time seemed to twistand crack; the church seemed filled with spectres and litten with the hell-glowof eternal cold fire. It seemed that I saw James Boon, hideous and misshapen,cavorting around the supine body of a woman, and my Grand-Uncle Philip behindhim, an acolyte in a black, hooded cassock, who held a knife and a bowl.“Deum vobiscum magna vermis—”The words shuddered and writhed on the page before me, soaked in the blood ofsacrifice, prize of a creature that shambles beyond the stars—A blind, interbred congregation swaying in mindless, daemoniac praise; deformedfaces filled with hungering, nameless anticipation—And the Latin was replaced by an older tongue, ancient when Egypt was young andthe Pyramids unbuilt, ancient when this Earth still hung in an unformed, boilingfirmament of empty gas:“Gyyagiti vardar Yogsoggoth! Verminis! Gyyagin! Gyyagin! Gyyagin!”The pulpit began to rend and split, pushing upward—Calvin screamed and lifted an arm to shield his face. The narthex trembled witha huge, tenebrous motion like a ship wracked in a gale. I snatched up the bookand held it away from me; it seemed filled with the heat of the sun and I feltthat I should be cindered, blinded.“Run!” Calvin screamed. “Run!”But I stood frozen and the alien presence filled me like an ancient vessel thathad waited for years—for generations!“Gyyagin vardar!” I screamed. “Servant of Yogsoggoth, the Nameless One! The Wormfrom beyond Space! Star-Eater! Blinder of Time! Verminis! Now comes the Hour ofFilling, the Time of Rending! Verminis! Alyah! Alyah! Gyyagin!”Calvin pushed me and I tottered, the church whirling before me, and fell to thefloor. My head crashed against the edge of an upturned pew, and red fire filledmy head—yet seemed to clear it.I groped for the sulphur matches I had brought.Subterranean thunder filled the place. Plaster fell. The rusted bell in thesteeple pealed a choked devil’s carillon in sympathetic vibration.My match flared. I touched it to the book just as the pulpit exploded upward ina rending explosion of wood. A huge black maw was discovered beneath; Caltottered on the edge, his hands held out, his face distended in a wordlessscream that I shall hear forever.And then there was a huge surge of gray, vibrating flesh. The smell became anightmare tide. It was a huge outpouring of a viscid, pustulant jelly, a hugeand awful form that seemed to skyrocket from the very bowels of the ground. Andyet, with a sudden horrible comprehension which no man can have known, Iperceived that it was but one ring, one segment, of a monster worm that hadexisted eyeless for years in the chambered darkness beneath that abominatedchurch!The book flared alight in my hands, and the Thing seemed to scream soundlesslyabove me. Calvin was struck glancingly and flung the length of the church like adoll with a broken neck.It subsided—the thing subsided, leaving only a huge and shattered holesurrounded with black slime, and a great screaming, mewling sound that seemed tofade through colossal distances and was gone.I looked down. The book was ashes.I began to laugh, then to howl like a struck beast.All sanity left me, and I sat on the floor with blood streaming from my temple,screaming and gibbering into those unhallowed shadows while Calvin sprawled inthe far corner, staring at me with glazing, horror-struck eyes.I have no idea how long I existed in that state. It is beyond all telling. Butwhen I came again to my faculties, shadows had drawn long paths around me and Isat in twilight. Movement had caught my eye, movement from the shattered hole inthe narthex floor.A hand groped its way over the riven floorboards.My mad laughter choked in my throat. All hysteria melted into numbbloodlessness.With terrible, vengeful slowness, a wracked figure pulled itself up fromdarkness, and a half-skull peered at me. Beetles crawled over the fleshlessforehead. A rotted cassock clung to the askew hollows of mouldered collarbones.Only the eyes lived—red, insane pits that glared at me with more than lunacy;they glared with the empty life of the pathless wastes beyond the edges of theUniverse.It came to take me down to darkness.That was when I fled, screeching, leaving the body of my lifelong friendunheeded in that place of dread. I ran until the air seemed to burst like magmain my lungs and brain. I ran until I had gained this possessed and tainted houseagain, and my room, where I collapsed and have lain like a dead man untilto-day. I ran because even in my crazed state, and even in the shattered ruin ofthat dead-yet-animated shape, I had seen the family resemblance. Yet not ofPhilip or of Robert, whose likenesses hang in the upstairs gallery. That rottedvisage belonged to James Boon, Keeper of the Worm!He still lives somewhere in the twisted, lightless wanderings beneathJerusalem’s Lot and Chapelwaite—and It still lives. The burning of the bookthwarted It, but there are other copies.Yet I am the gateway, and I am the last of the Boone blood. For the good of allhumanity I must die … and break the chain forever.I go to the sea now, Bones. My journey, like my story, is at an end. May Godrest you and grant you all peace.CHARLES.* * *The odd series of papers above was eventually received by Mr. Everett Granson,to whom they had been addressed. It is assumed that a recurrence of theunfortunate brain fever which struck him originally following the death of hiswife in 1848 caused Charles Boone to lose his sanity and murder his companionand longtime friend, Mr. Calvin McCann.The entries in Mr. McCann’s pocket journal are a fascinating exercise inforgery, undoubtedly perpetrated by Charles Boone in an effort to reinforce hisown paranoid delusions.In at least two particulars, however, Charles Boone is proved wrong. First, whenthe town of Jerusalem’s Lot was “rediscovered” (I use the term historically, ofcourse), the floor of the narthex, although rotted, showed no sign of explosionor huge damage. Although the ancient pews were overturned and several windowsshattered, this can be assumed to be the work of vandals from neighboring townsover the years. Among the older residents of Preacher’s Corners and Tandrellthere is still some idle rumor about Jerusalem’s Lot (perhaps, in his day, itwas this kind of harmless folk legend which started Charles Boone’s mind on itsfatal course), but this seems hardly relevant.Second, Charles Boone was not the last of his line. His grandfather, RobertBoone, sired at least two bastards. One died in infancy. The second took theBoone name and located in the town of Central Falls, Rhode Island. I am thefinal descendant of this offshoot of the Boone line; Charles Boone’s secondcousin, removed by three generations. These papers have been in my committal forten years. I offer them for publication on the occasion of my residence in theBoone ancestral home, Chapelwaite, in the hope that the reader will findsympathy in his heart for Charles Boone’s poor, misguided soul. So far as I cantell, he was correct about only one thing: this place badly needs the servicesof an exterminator.There are some huge rats in the walls, by the sound.Signed,James Robert BooneOctober 2, 1971.* Originally published by Night Shift, 1978."},{"pageContent":"DISCOVERY OF THE GHOORIC ZONE*[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L02_r1.jpg]RIUHARD A. LUPOFF[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L03_r1.jpg]They were having sex when the warning gong sounded, Gomati and Njord and Shoten.The shimmering, fading sound indicated first long-range contact with the remoteobject, the long-suspected but never-before-visited tenth planet that circledfar beyond the eccentric orbit of Pluto, rolling about its distant primary withirrational speed, its huge mass bathed in eternal darkness and incredible coldsome sixteen billion kilometers from the remote, almost invisible, sun.Gomati was the female member of the ship’s crew. She was tall, nearly two metersfrom the top of her satiny smooth scalp to the tips of her glittering tin-alloytoenails. When the gong sounded she burst into a cascade of rippling laughter,high-pitched and mirthful, at the incongruity of the cosmic event’s impingementupon the fleshly.The ship had launched from Pluto, even though at this point in Pluto’s orbit itwas less distant from the sun than was Neptune. Fabricated in the nearlynull-gravity conditions of Neptune’s tiny moon Nereid, the ship had been ferriedback, segment by segment, for assembly, for the cyborging of its scores of tinybiotic brains, onloading of its three-member crew, and its launch from thecratered rock surface of Pluto.Njord, the male crew member, cursed, distracted by the radar gong, angered byGomati’s inattention, humiliated by her amusement and by her drawing away fromhimself and Shoten. Njord felt his organ grow flaccid at the distraction, andfor the moment he regretted the decision he had made, prior to the cyborgingoperations of his adolescence, to retain his organic phallus and gonads. Acyborged capability might have proven more potently enduring in thecircumstances, but Njord’s pubescent pride had denied the possibility of hisever facing inconvenient detumescence.Flung from rocky Pluto as the planet swung toward the ecliptic on its nearlyeighteen-degree zoom, the ship was virtually catapulted away from the sun; itswung around Neptune, paid passing salute to the satellite of its birth withcourse-correcting emissions, then fled, a dart from the gravitic sling, into theblack unknown.And Shoten, most extensively cyborged of the crew members, flicked a mentalcommand. Hooking into the ship’s sensors, Shoten homed the consciousness of thenavigational biotic brains onto the remote readouts that spelled the location ofthe distant object. The readouts confirmed suspected information about theobject: its great mass, its incredible distance beyond even the aphelion of theorbit of Pluto some eight billion kilometers from the sun—the distant objectcircled its primary at a distance twice as great as Pluto’s farthest departurefrom the solar epicenter.The ship—named Khons in honor of an ancient celestial deity—held life-supportsupplies for the three crew members and fuel and power reserves for the completeoutward journey, the planned landing on the distant object, the return takeoffand journey and final landing, not on Pluto—which by the time of Khons’s returnwould be far above the solar ecliptic and beyond the orbit of Neptune—but onNeptune’s larger moon Triton, where a reception base had been readied beforeKhons ever had launched on its journey of exploration.As for Njord, he grumbled under his breath, wishing almost irrelevantly that heknew the original gender of Shoten Binayakya before the latter’s cyborging.Njord Freyr, born in the Laddino Imperium of earth, had retained his masculinityeven as he had undergone the customary implantations, excisions, andmodifications of pubescent cyborging.Sri Gomati, of Khmeric Gondwanaland, had similarly retained her female primarycharacteristics in function and conformation even though she had opted for thesubstitution of metallic labia and clitoris, which replacement Njord Freyr foundat times irritating.But Shoten, Shoten Binayakya, fitted with multiple configurable genitalia,remained enigmatic, ambiguous as to his or her own origin: earthborn, orclaiming so, yet giving allegiance neither to the Laddino Imperium governed byYamm Kerit ben Chibcha, as did Njord Freyr, nor to Khmeric Gondwanaland, ruledby Nrisimha, the Little Lion, where lay the loyalty of Sri Gomati.“So,” Njord grated. “So, the great planet thus announces its presence.” Hegrimaced as automatic materials-reclamation servos skittered futilely, seekingrecoverable proteoids from the aborted congress.Sri Gomati, enigmatic silvered cyberoptics glittering, turned to face thedisgruntled Njord, the ambiguous Shoten. “Can you see it yet?” she asked. “Canyou get a visual fix?”Shoten Binayakya reached a cyberclaw, tapped a visual extensor control. Bioticbrains keyed to obey any crew member activated the extensor, guided it towardone glittering optic. The shimmering field crept aside; input receptaclesopened, ready for the insertion of fiber-optic conductors.A click, silence.[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]D68/Y37/C22/FLASHYamm Kerit ben Chibcha’s coronation was splendid. Never before had the SouthPolar Jerusalem seen such pomp, such display of pageantry and power. Thousandsof slaves, naked and gilded and draped in jewelry and feathers, paraded up thewide boulevard before the Imperial Palace. They drew, by ropes of woven gold andweizmannium, glittering juggernauts. Fountains sprayed scented wine.Chamberlains threw fistfuls of xanthic shekels to cheering crowds.The climax of the spectacle was the march of the anthrocyberphants, resplendentmutated elephants whose cerebellums had been surgically removed at birth andreplaced with spheres of human brain material cultured from clone-cells donated(involuntarily in some cases) by the greatest scientists, scholars, andintellectuals in Yamm Kerit ben Chibcha’s realm. When the anthrocyberphants werewell grown and into their adolescence, their gonads were surgically removed andreplaced with a variety of electronic implants, including inertial guidancecomputers, magnetic compass-gyroscopes, neural transceivers.The anthrocyberphants pranced and tumbled down the grand boulevard before theImperial Palace, trumpeting melodies from Wagner, Mendelssohn, Bach, Mozart,vain self-portraiture by Richard Strauss, erotic fantasies by Scriabin, extendedlines from Britten, discordant percussives by Edgard varèse, all in perfectorchestral harmony, all punctuated by the sounds of tympani, timbales,kettledrums, and cymbals held in writhing flexible tentacles that grew fromnodes at the marchers’ shoulders.Upon the silken-draped and jewel-encrusted balcony of the Imperial Palace, theUltimate Monarch of Laddino Imperium smiled and waved, bowed, applauded, turnedto turbaned chamberlains, and grasped fistfuls of commemorative favors to tossgraciously upon the marchers and the cheering crowds come to celebrate the grandceremonial.The Laddino Imperium included all of the grand Antarctic domain of the formerIsrael-in-Exile and the expanded territory of Greater Hai Brasil that hadextended to claim hegemony over all of the Americas, from Hudson’s Bay toPatagonia, before falling under sway of the South Polar nation. The UltimateMonarch, Yamm Kerit ben Chibcha, bowed, waved, tossed favors to the crowd. Deepin the bowels of the earth beneath once-frozen plains and mountains, hugegyroscopes throbbed into life.The axis of the earth began to shift through a lengthy and carefully computedcycle. None but the servants and advisors of the Ultimate Monarch had beenconsulted, and none but the will of Yamm Kerit ben Chibcha, the UltimateMonarch, was considered. The ambition of Yamm Kerit ben Chibcha was to giveevery citizen of the planet earth, every square meter of territory, a fair andequitable access to the wealth, the beauty, the joy, the light, the warmth ofthe sun.As the huge gyroscopes whirled their massive flywheels, the earth shifted itsancient tilt.The fanatic hordes of Nrisimha, the Little Lion, poured from the city of Medinain the ancient Arabian desert, conquering all before them in the holy name ofthe Little Lion of God. The forces of Novum Romanum, the empire built by FortunaPales, and of the New Khmer Domain, created a century before by Vidya Devi,slaughtered the followers of the Little Lion Nrisimha by the hundreds ofthousands, then by the millions.How could Nrisimha continue to replace the decimated armies? How many soldierscould the single city of Medina produce? What was the secret of the fanaticalhordes?No one knew.But they poured forth, fearless, unstoppable, unslowable, unturnable. All thatthe forces of resistance could do was slaughter them by the million, and theyfell, they fell, but their fellows only marched across their very bodies, theirstrange bodies that did not putrefy like the corpses of normal soldiers butseemed instead to turn to an amorphous gel and then to sink into the earthitself, leaving behind no sign of their presence, not even uniforms or weaponsor equipment, but only, in the wake of their passage, fields of strange flowersand fruits that bloomed gorgeously into towering pillars and petals and berriesthe size of melons, that produced sweet narcotic fumes and brought to those whoharvested and ate them dreams of haunting beauty and incomparable weirdness.Strange messengers sped across the sands of the deserts of Africa and Asiabearing the word that the Little Lion Nrisimha had come to bring peace and gloryand splendor to a new Empire, to Khmeric Gondwanaland, an absolute dictatorshipof unparalleled benevolence that would stretch from Siberia to Ireland and fromthe Arctic Circle to the Cape of Good Hope.It took remarkably few years for the followers of the Little Lion Nrisimha tocomplete their conquest, and few more for the establishment of an efficientinfrastructure and the appointment of regional satrapies under the absolutecommand of Nrisimha.Khmeric Gondwanaland was a roaring success.It was less than a century from the complete triumph of Yamm Kerit ben Chibchathroughout the Laddino Imperium and that of Nrisimha the Little Lion in KhmericGondwanaland, when the two great empires were driven into union by the eruptionof attacking batrachian forces from beneath the seas of the planet. How longthese strange froglike intelligences had lived in their deep and gloomymetropoli hundreds of meters beneath the surface of the earth’s oceans willremain forever imponderable.What stimulated them to rise and attack the land-dwelling nations of the earthis also unknown, although in all likelihood the steady shifting of the earth’saxis brought about by the gargantuan subterranean gyroscopes of Yamm Kerit benChibcha was in fact the cause of the attacks.The Deep Ones emerged and waded ashore in all regions at once. They wore onlystrangely crafted bangles and ornaments of uncorroded metal. They carriedweapons resembling the barbed tridents of marine legendry. They dragged behindthem terrible stone statues of indescribable extramundane monstrosities beforewhich they conducted rites of blasphemous abandon and unmentionable perversion.The Laddino Imperium and Khmeric Gondwanaland combined their respective might todeal with the menace, to drive the strange Deep Ones back into the murky realmsfrom which they had emerged. By the year 2337 a unified earth lay once moretranquil and prosperous beneath a glowing and benevolent sun.The menace of the Deep Ones, at least for the time, was over.And billions of kilometers from earth, humanity renewed its heroic thrust towardthe outermost regions of the solar system.[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]MARCH 15, 2337“Not yet,” Shoten Binayakya’s voice clattered.“Soon,” Gomati countered. She hooked into Khons’s radar sensor, letting cyborgedbiots convert incoming pulses into pseudovisuals. “Look!” she exclaimed. “It’s awhole system!”Njord Freyr stirred, determined to pull his attention away from frustration,direct it toward a topic that would involve. “There, there,” he heard Gomati’svoice, not sure whether it was organic or synthesized, “shift your input toultra-v!”Njord, hooking into Khons’s external sensors, complied.“Astounding!”“Yet so.”“Not unprecedented. On the contrary,” Shoten Binayakya interjected. “All thegiants have complex systems of moons. Jupiter. Saturn. Uranus. Search yourmemory banks if you don’t recall.”Surlily, Njord sped unnecessary inquiry to an implanted cyberbiot. “Mmh,” hegrunted. “So. Almost thirty significant satellites among them. Plus the trash.So.” He nodded.“And this new giant—?”“Not new,” Njord corrected. “It’s been there all along, as long as any of theothers. You know the old Laplace notion of elder planets and younger planets wasabandoned about the same time as the solid atom and the flat earth.”“Good work, Freyr,” Shoten shot sarcastically.“Well then?”Sri Gomati said, “Clearly, Njord, Shoten meant newly discovered.” She paused fora fraction of a second. “And about to be newly visited.”Njord breathed a sigh of annoyance. “Well. And that old European,what’s-his-name, Galapagos saw the major moons of Jupiter seven hundred yearsago. All the others followed as soon as the optical telescope was developed.They didn’t even need radiation sensors, no less probes to find them. Sevenhundred years.”“Seven hundred twenty-seven, Njord.” Sri Gomati petted him gently on hisgenitals.“You and your obsession with ancient history! I don’t see how you qualified forthis mission, Gomati, always chasing after obscure theorizers and writers!”“It’s hardly an obsession. Galileo was one of the key figures in the history ofscience. And he found the four big Jovian moons in 1610. It’s simple arithmeticto subtract that from 2337 and get seven-two-seven. I didn’t even have to callon a cyberbiot to compute that, Njord dear.”“Argh!” The flesh remnants in Njord’s face grew hot.Shoten Binayakya interrupted the argument. “There it comes into visual range!”he exclaimed. “After these centuries, the perturbations of Uranus and Neptunesolved at last. Planet X!”Njord sneered. “You have a great predilection for the melodramatic, Shoten!Planet X, indeed!”“Why,” Shoten laughed, the sound fully synthesized, “it’s a happy coincidence,Njord dear. Lowell applied the term to his mystery planet, meaning X theunknown. Until Tombaugh found it and named it Pluto. But now it is not only Xthe unknown but also X the tenth planet as well. Very neat!”Njord began a reply but paused as the distant planet became visible throughKhons’s sensors. It was indeed a system like those of the inner giant planets,and radar sensings pouring through Khons’s external devices, filtered andprocessed by cyberbiotic brains, overwhelmed his own consciousness.A great dark body swam through the blackness, reflecting almost no light fromthe distant sun but glowing darkly, menacingly, pulsating in slow heartbeatlikewaves, with a low crimson radiance that pained Njord subliminally even throughthe ship’s mechanisms and the processing of the cyberbiots. Fascinated yetrepelled, Njord stared at the glowing, pulsing globe.About its obscene oblateness whirled a family of smaller bodies, themselvesapparently dim and lifeless, yet illuminated by the raking sinister tone oftheir parent.“Yuggoth,” Sri Gomati’s low whisper jolted Njord from his reverie. “Yuggoth,”and again, “Yuggoth!”Njord snapped, “What’s that?”“Yuggoth,” repeated Sri Gomati.The male hissed in annoyance, watched the great pulsating bulk loom larger inKhons’s external sensors, watched its family of moons, themselves behaving liketoy planets in orbit around the glowing body’s miniature sun.“The great world must be Yuggoth,” Sri Gomati crooned. “And the lesser onesNithon, Zaman; the whirling pair—see them, see!—Thog and its twin Thok with thefoul lake where puffed shoggoths splash.”“Do you know what she is raving about?” Njord demanded of Shoten Binayakya, butShoten only shook that ambivalent satiny head, two silvery eyes shimmering,stainless steel upper and lower monodont revealed by drawn-back organic lips.Khons’s remote sensors had accumulated enough data now, the ship’s cyberbiotscomputed and reduced the inputs, to provide a set of readouts on the newplanetary grouping’s characteristics. Shoten raised a telescoping cyberimplantand pointed toward a glowing screen where data crept slowly from top to bottom.“See,” the ambiguous, synthesized voice purled, “the planet’s mass is gigantic.Double that of Jupiter. As great as six hundred earths! More oblate even thanJupiter also—what is its spin?” Shoten paused while more lines of informationcrept onto the screen. “Its rotation is even shorter than Jupiter’s. Its surfacespeed must be—” He paused and sent a command through the ship’s neurocybernetwork, grinned at the response that appeared on the screen.“Think of resting on the surface of that planet and whirling about at eightythousand kilometers an hour!”Njord Freyr rose from his rest-couch. In fact the least extensively cyborged ofthe three, he retained three of his original organic limbs. He pulled himselfaround, using Khons’s interior freefall handholds to steady himself, hooked hisstrongly servomeched arm through two handholds, and gestured angrily from Shotento Sri Gomati.“We can all read the screens. I asked what this Eurasian bitch was babblingabout!”“Now, dear,” Shoten Binayakya purred ambiguously.Sri Gomati’s shimmering silvery eyes seemed for once not totally masked, butfixed on some distant vision. Her hands—one fitted with an array of scientificand mechanical implements, the other implanted with a multitude of flexiblecartilaginous organs equally suited for technical manipulation and eroticexcesses—wove and fluttered before her face. She spoke as much to herself or tosome absent, invisible entity as to Njord Freyr or Shoten Binayakya. It was asif she instructed the batches of cyberbiotic brains that populated theelectronic network of the ship.“March 15, 2337, earth standard time,” she crooned. “It would please him. Itwould please him to know that he is remembered. That he was right in his ownday. But how, I wonder, could he have known? Did he merely guess? Was he incontact with entities from beyond? Beings from this strange, gray world past thestarry void, this pale, shadowy land?“Dead four hundred years this day, Howard, does your dust lie in ancient groundstill? Could some later Curwen not have raised your essential salts?”“Madness!” Njord Freyr broke in. With his organic hand he struck Gomati’s face,his palm rebounding from the hard bone and the harder metal implanted beneathher flesh.Her glittering eyes aflash, she jerked her head away, at the same time twistingto fix him with her angry glare. A circuit of tension sprang into being betweenthem, lips of both writhing, faces animated in mute quarrel. Beyond this,neither moved.Only the interruption of Shoten Binayakya’s commanding speech broke the tenseimmobility. “While you carried out your spat, dears, I had the cyberbiots plotour orbit through the new system.”“The system of Yuggoth,” Gomati reiterated.“As you wish.”The data screen went to abstract blobs for fractions of a second, then it wasfilled with a glowing diagram of the new system: the oblate pulsating planet,its scabrous surface features whirling in the center of the screen; the smallerrocky moons revolving rapidly about their master.“We can land only once,” Shoten purred. “We must carefully select our touchdownpoint. Then later expeditions may explore further. But if we choose poorly, theworlds may abandon this Yuggoth”—Gomati’s name for the great planet was spokensardonically—“forever.” Shoten’s cyborged head nodded in self-affirmation, thenthe synthesized words were repeated, “Yes, forever.”[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]15032137—READOUTThe Asia-Pacific Co-prosperity Sphere continued to evolve. It was, beyondquestion, the center of world power, economic development, political leadership.It was also a gigantic realm sprawling across continents and oceans, includingscores of great cities and billions of citizens.Its first city was Beijing. Secondary centers of authority were established inLhasa, Bombay, Mandalay, Quezon City, Adelaide, Christ-church, Santa Ana.The first great leader of the Sphere, Vo Tran Quoc, had become a figure oflegendary proportions within a century of his death. Schools contended as to histrue identity. Despite his name, he was not Vietnamese. That much was known. Onegroup of scholars held that he was a Maori. Another, that he was an Ainu. Athird, that he was a Bengali woman, the product of rape during the war ofindependence of Bangladesh from Pakistan, posing as a man (or possibly havingundergone a sex-change operation involving the grafting of a donated penis andtestes).At any rate, Vo Tran Quoc died.In the wake of his death a struggle broke out. Some who contended for the powerof the dead leader did so on the basis of purely personal ambition. Others, fromideological conviction. The great ideological dispute of the year 2137 dealtwith the proper interpretation of an ancient political dictum.The ancient political dictum was: Just as there is not a single thing in theworld without a dual nature, so imperialism and all reactionaries have a dualnature—they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time.While political theorists in Beijing quarreled over the meaning of thispolitical dictum, a new force arose with its center in the eldritch city ofAngkor Wat deep in the jungles of old Cambodia. The new political force broughtabout a world feminist order. Its leader, following the example of Vo Tran Quoc,took the name of a mythic personage from another culture than her own.She proclaimed a New Khmer Empire stretching from the Urals to the Rockies.She took the name Vidya Devi. This means goddess of wisdom.The former Slavic domain and the Maghreb suffered rivalry that led, after acentury, to convergence and ultimate amalgamation. The old Roman Empire wasreborn. It included all of Europe, the Near East, Africa, and North America fromthe Atlantic to the Pacific. (Niagara Falls now poured its waters directly intothe ocean; the former west bank of the Hudson River was choice seashoreproperty. The Rockies overlooked pounding waves that stretched to the Asianshore.)The empire was ruled by an absolute monarch under the tutelage of the worldfeminist order. She was known as the Empress Fortuna Pales I.Latin America, from Tierra del Fuego to the southern bank of the Rio Grande (butexcluding Baja), was the greater Hai Brasil. The empress claimed pure Bourbonancestry. Her name was Astrud do Muiscos.In the Antarctic a great land-reclamation project had been undertaken.Geothermal power was used to melt the ice in a circle centered on the southpole. The cleared area measured 1.5 million square kilometers. The soil wasfound to be incredibly rich in minerals. It was hugely fertile. The scenicbeauty of the region was incomparable. There were mountains, lakes, glaciers, toshame those of New Zealand or Switzerland or Tibet. Forests were planted andgrew rapidly and luxuriantly. Imported wildlife throve. The few nativespecies—penguins, amphibian mammals, a strange variety of bird newly discoveredand named the tekeli-li—were protected.The new country was called Yisroel Diaspora.Its leader under the feminist world order was Tanit Shadrapha. This name meansthe healer Ishtar.The feminist world order promoted scientific research, largely from bases inYisroel Diaspora. Space exploration, long abandoned except for the developmentof orbiting weapons-systems, was resumed. Bases were established on the planetMars and among the asteroids. A crewed ship orbited Venus, making closeobservations and sending robot monitors and samplers to the surface of theplanet. Venus was found to be a worthless and inhospitable piece of real estate.A landing was attempted on the surface of Mercury. The expedition was anambitious undertaking. The lander was to touch down just on the dark side of theplanetary terminator, thence to be carried into the night. During the Mercuriannight it would burrow beneath the surface. By the time the terminator wasreached and the ship entered the day side, it would be safely entombed andwould, in effect, estivate through the searing Mercurian day.Something went wrong. The ship landed. Excavation work began. Then, almost as ifthe planet were eating the ship and its crew, all disappeared beneath thesurface. They were never contacted again.* * *On earth the dominant art form was something called cheomnaury. This involved ablending and transformation of sensory inputs. The most favored sensorycombinations were sound, odor, and flavor. The greatest cheomnaurist in theworld was an Ecuadorian dwarf who found her way to the capital of Hai Brasil andobtained personal audience with Astrud do Muiscos herself.The dwarf began her performance with a presentation involving the sound of surfpounding upon the rocks of the Pacific coast where Andean granite plungeshundreds of feet into icy foam. This was blended with the warm, rich odor ofchestnuts roasting over a charcoal brazier. To this the dwarf added the subtleflavor of ground coriander.Astrud do Muiscos was pleased.The dwarf proceeded to offer a blend of a synthesized voice such as might comefrom a living volcano, to which she added a scent of natron and olive unknownoutside the secret embalming chamber of Egyptian temples six thousand years old,to which was added the flavor of the spithrus locusta. The spithrus locusta is amarine arachnid, the flavor of whose meat is to that of ordinary broiled lobsteras is that of the lobster to a common crab louse.Astrud do Muiscos was very pleased.The triumph of the dwarf was a combination of white noise in the ordinary rangeof audibility with subtle sub- and supersonics, mixed with the odor of aquintessential coca extract and the flavor of concentrated formic acid drawnfrom Amazonian driver ants.Astrud do Muiscos named the dwarf her successor to the throne of Hai Brasil.The religion of the day, as appropriate to the climate of political realities,was a mutated form of the ancient Ishtar cult, with local variations asAshtoroth, Astarte, and Aphrodite. There was even a sort of universal Mamacy,with its seat in ancient but restored Babylon.[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]MARCH 15, 2337“I don’t see why it’s taken so long to get here, anyway,” Njord Freyr snapped.“You mean from Pluto?” Shoten responded. “But we are on course. We are infree-fall. Look.” The cyberbiots superimposed a small box of course data besidethe whirling diagram of the Yuggoth system.“Not from Pluto!” Njord spat. “From earth! Why has it taken until 2337 toreach—Yuggoth? When space flight began almost as long ago as the era Sri Gomatibabbles about. The first extraterrestrial landings took place in 1969. Marsthirty years later. Remember the stirring political slogan that we all learnedas children, as children studying the history of our era? Persons will set footon another planet before the century ends! That was the twentieth century,remember?”“Every schoolchild knows,” Shoten affirmed wearily.Gomati, recovered from the shock of Njord’s blow, spoke. “We could have beenhere two hundred years ago, Njord Freyr. But fools on earth lost heart. Theybegan, and lost heart. They began again—and lost heart again. And again. Fourtimes they set out, exploring the planets. Each time they lost heart, lostcourage, lost interest. Were distracted by wars. Turned resources to noblerpurposes.“Humankind reached Mars as promised. And lost heart. Started once more underShahar Shalim of the old New Maghreb. Reached Venus and Mercury. And lost heart.Reached the Asteroid Belt and the gas giants under Tanit Shadrapha of Ugarit.And lost heart.“And now. At last. We are here.” She gestured with her flowing, waving tentaclestoward the diagram that glowed against the ship’s dull fittings.“What course, Shoten Binayakya?” she asked brusquely.The whirling bodies on the screen were marked in red, the pulsing red ofYuggoth’s inner flames, the beating, reflected red of the madly dashing moons. Acontrasting object appeared on the screen, the flattened cone-shape of the shipKhons, trailing in its wake as it wove among the bodies a line to show thecourse of its passage. Shortly the line had woven past, circled about, curvedbeyond each body in the diagram, leaving the stylized representation of Khons inperturbated circular orbit about the entire system.“So,” purred Shoten Binayakya. And Sri Gomati and Njord Freyr in turn. “So.”“So.”Shoten Binayakya flicked a pressure plate with some limb, some tool. Khonsbucked, slithered, through a complex course correction. Shoten slapped anotherplate and the full exterior optics of Khons were activated; to the three membersof the crew, hooked into the cyberbiotic system of the ship, it was as if theyfell freely through the distantly star-sprayed night. Fell, fell toward red,glowing, pulsating Yuggoth and its family of gray dancing servants.Khons, inserted into its new flight path, sped first past the outermost ofYuggoth’s moons: a world of significant size. The ship’s sensors and cyberbiotsreported on the body: in mass and diameter not far from the dimensions of thefamiliar rock-and-water satellites of the outer planets. Close to five thousandkilometers through its center and marked with the nearly universal cratering ofevery solid world from Mercury to Pluto.The twins, dubbed Thog and Thok by Gomati, whirled at the opposite extremes oftheir interwoven orbits, so Khons flitted past the innermost of the four moons,another apparent replica of the familiar Ganymede-Callisto-Titan-Triton model,then dropped into equatorial orbit about the dully glowing, oblate Yuggoth.Njord, Gomati, Shoten Binayakya fell silent. The sounds of Khons’s automaticsystems, the low hiss of recirculating air, the occasional hum or click of aservo, the slow breathing of Njord Freyr, of Sri Gomati, were the only sounds.(Shoten Binayakya’s lungs had been cybermeched, whirred softly, steadily withinthe metal torso.)Once more a limb flicked at a pressure plate, moved this time by feel alone. Theship, fully visible to any hypothetical viewer outside its hull, was forpractical purposes totally transparent to its crew. A circuit warmed instantlyto life. Radiation sensors picked up the electrical field of the planet,converted it to audio range, broadcast it within Khons: a howl, a moan. Witheach pulsation of the planet’s ruddy illumination, the sound modulated throughan obscene parody of some despairing sigh.“If only Holst had known!” the synthesized voice of Shoten whispered. “If onlyhe had known.”Yuggoth’s surface sped beneath the ship, its terrible velocity of rotationmaking features slip away as others rushed toward the viewers, flashed beneathand dropped away, disappearing across the sprawling horizon into interstellarblackness. Great viscous plates of darkly glowing semisolid rock hundreds ofkilometers across rolled and crashed majestically. Between them red-hot magmaglowed bale-fully, great tongues of liquid rock licking upward between thepounding solid plates, the heat and brightness of the magma growing andlessening in a slow, steady rhythm that Khons’s cyberbiots and audio-scannersconverted into a contrabass throb-throb-throb-throb.“There can be no life there,” Njord Freyr announced. “Nothing could live in thatenvironment. Nothing could ever have lived there.”After a silence Sri Gomati challenged him. “The planet itself, Njord Freyr.Could it be a single organism? The sounds, the movement, the energy.” She raisedher organic hand to her brow, ran scores of writhing digits from the browlineabove her glittering silver eyes, across her satiny naked skull to the base ofher neck.“It could be a nascent sun,” Shoten Binayakya whispered. “Were Jupiter larger,more energetic—you know it has been suggested that Jupiter is a failed attemptat the creation of a partner for Sol, that our own solar system is anunsuccessful venture at the formation of a double star.”“And Yuggoth?” Gomati dropped her tentacular hand to her lap.Njord Freyr’s voice contained only a tincture of sarcasm. “Sent by some remotegodling to undo Jupiter’s failure, hey? How do we know that it’s always beenhere? Before now we knew it existed at all only through courtesy of Neptune’sand Pluto’s perturbations. How do we know this Yuggoth isn’t a new arrival inthe system? Nobody knew that Neptune or Pluto existed until a few centuriesago!”“Or perhaps,” purred Shoten, “perhaps our system is a failed triple star. Ah,think of the show if we had three suns to light our worlds instead of one!”Again Shoten Binayakya flicked at a pressure plate. Once more Khons shifted,jounced. There was a steady acceleration and the ship slid from its orbit aroundthe ruddy pulsating planet, fell away from Yuggoth and toward the spinningworldlets that occupied the central orbit around the planet.“They must be,” Gomati crooned softly, “they must be. Thog and Thok, Thog andThok. How could he know, centuries past? Let some Curwen find the salts and lethim tell!”“You’re babbling again!” Njord almost shouted. “I thought we were selected forstability for this mission. How did you ever get past the screening?”Distracted, Sri Gomati slowly dragged her fascinated gaze from the spinningmoons, turned silver eyes toward Njord Freyr. “Somehow he knew,” she mumbled.Her lips drew back in a slow smile showing her bright steel monodonts. “Andsomehow we will find the Ghooric zone where the fungi blossom!”As if in a trance she turned slowly away, leaned forward, eyes glitteringmetallically, leaned and reached her hands, the cyborged and the geneticallycustom-formed, as if to touch the two red-gray worldlets.“He wrote horror stories,” Gomati said, her voice dead-level as iftrance-ridden. “He wrote of an unknown outer planet that he called Yuggoth, andof others—Nithon, Zaman, Thog, and Thok—and of horrid, puffy beasts calledshoggoths that splashed obscenely in the pools of the Ghooric zone.“He died four hundred years ago today, Howard did. But first he wrote of oneCurwen who could restore the dead if only he could obtain their essential salts.What he called their essential salts.” She paused and giggled. “Maybe he had aprevision of cloning!”MAR 15, 2037—A VIDEOTAPEOpen with a logo recognizable as representing world politics.The old century ended with a definite shift of world power. The westwardmovement of two millennia continued. Mesopotamia, Hellas, Italia,Franco-Germania, England, America. Now the power in America shifted from anAtlantic to a Pacific orientation.The new powers to contend with were Japan, China, Soviet Asia.Western Europe and the eastern United States lapsed into terminal decadence asloci of civilization. Europe from the Danube to the Urals passed from Habsburgand Romanoff glitter to a brief democratic flicker to a drab gray dusk as SovietEurope and then into Slavic night. Like its predecessor of fifteen centuries,the Soviet Empire split in half; like the Western half of the predecessor, theWestern Soviet Empire was overrun by barbarians. But it did not fall to thebarbarians. Not really. It fell to its own internal rot. And like the easternhalf of the predecessor, the Eastern Soviet Empire throve.By the hundredth anniversary of that death in the Jane Brown Memorial Hospital,the landmass of the earth eastward from the Urals to the Rockies came underunified government. It included dozens of half-forgotten countries. Tibet.Afghanistan. India. Laos. Australia. Tonga. The Philippines. Manchuria.Mongolia. California. Baja.It was called the Asia-Pacific Co-prosperity Sphere.Europe from the Urals to the English Channel became a peninsula of forests andfarms. What small vigor remained was concentrated in the region from the Danubeto the Urals. Slavic influence, walled off in the East by the great andburgeoning Asian renaissance, spread northward and westward. After a pause atthe limits of a region running from the Scandinavian Peninsula to the Iberian,the Slavic Empire launched its rude invasion fleet. It crossed the EnglishChannel. There was little resistance. The few defenders of British sovereignty,under the leadership of a fellow called Harald, were defeated at a place calledRunnymede.The next westward hop was to America. It took the Slavs a while to preparethemselves for that. But when they made their move they were greeted withflowers and flags. They did not have to conquer. They only had to occupy andadminister.The third power of the world in this time took form to the south of the Slavicdomain. Arab leaders, glutted with petrobux, bought arms and hired mercenaries.Governments could not achieve unity, but a shadowy group known by the crypticname of opec did. The governments as such withered. The shadowy opec exercisedmore and more power. It did so more and more openly.Slowly the influence of opec spread westward and southward until all of the oldNear East and Africa were under its sway.Then was proclaimed the New Maghreb.Cut to logo representing heroic leadership.The most powerful person in the world was the Chairperson of the Asia-PacificCo-prosperity Sphere, Vo Tran Quoc.The leader of the second power, the Slavic Empire, was called Svarozits Perun.This name means thunderbolt of God.The head of opec and de facto ruler of the New Maghreb was called Shahar Shalim.This name means dawn of peace.Cut to logo representing sex.The major sexual attitude of the time was androgyny, rivaled but not equaled bythe cult of pansexuality. Androgyny implies a recognition of the full sexualpotential of each individual. Former distinctions were abandoned. It was nolonger regarded as improper to pursue a relationship of male to male or femaleto female; nor was it required to have two partners in a relationship. Practicesranging from onanism to mass interplay were accepted.The pansexualists held that androgyny was needlessly limiting in scope. If onecould relate to any man or woman—why not to a giraffe? A condor? A cabbage? Abowl of sand? A machine?The ocean?The sky?To the cosmos?To God?Cut to logo representing music.The most popular musical composition as of Mar 15, 2037, was ironically ahundred-year-old tune, complete with lyrics. Searches of nearly forgottenrecords revealed the names of the composer and lyricist. An old 78-rpmshellac-disk rendition of the tune was discovered in a watertight vault beneatha flooded city. The sound was transcribed and released once again to the world.The original lyrics had been written by one Jacob Jacobs. A second version, inEnglish, was used on the shellac disk. These words were by Sammy Cahn and SaulChaplin. The music was by Sholom Secunda. The singers were Patti, Maxene, andLaVerne Andrews. The song was “Bei Mit Bist du Schön.”Cut to logo representing geodynamics.The latter years of the twentieth century and the early decades of thetwenty-first were marked by changes in weather patterns and geodynamics.Accustomed to the reliable round of winter and summer, rainy season and dryseason, the flow of rivers and the currents and tides of the oceans, man hadcome to look upon the earth as a stable and dependable home.He was mistaken.A trivial shift in air patterns, a minor trembling of the planetary mantle, aminute increase or diminution of the sun’s warmth received by the planet, andthe mighty works of man crumbled like sand castles in the surf.An example. Earthquakes were more or less expected in certain regions: thePacific coast of North America, Japan, and eastern China, a Eurasian beltrunning from Yugoslavia through Greece and Turkey to Iran. Tragedies were maskedwith heroism, fear hidden behind the false face of humor. “When California fallsinto the ocean this piece of Arizona desert will be choice waterfront property.”Nobody expected New England and maritime Canada to crumble, but when the bigquake hit, they did. From the St. Lawrence to the Hudson. It started with atremor and rumble, grew to a scream and smash, ended with a gurgle and then thesoft, even lapping of the Atlantic waters.Among the bits of real estate that wound up on the ocean floor—a very minorbit—was a chunk of old Providence-Plantations known as Swan Point Cemetery. Nowthe Deep Ones indeed swam over the single stone marker of the Lovecraft familyplot. Winfield, Sarah, Howard, the marker was inscribed. Currents could flow allthe way from Devil’s Reef and Innsmouth Harbor to far Ponape in the Pacific, andthe Deep Ones visited Swan Point.In the field of religion, there was a revival of the ancient cults of thesea-gods, especially that of Dagon.[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]MARCH 15, 2337Khons slithered through another correction, took up a complex orbit that circledone moon, crossed to the other, circled, returned, describing over and over theconventional sign for the infinite.Shoten tapped a plate, and the large viewing screen inside Khons glowed oncemore, seeming to stand unsupported against the background of the two moons andthe distant star-sprayed blackness. Every now and again the progress of the twowhirling moons and Khons’s orbit around and between them would bring Yuggothitself swinging across the view of the three crew members so that one or both ofthe worldlets and the ship’s data screen swept opaquely across the dark,pulsating oblateness.Shoten commanded, and cyberbiots magnified the surface features of the moons onthe data screen. The omnipresent craters sprang up, but then, as themagnification increased, it became obvious that they were not the sharp-edgedfeatures of the typical airless satellite but the shortened, rounded curvestypical of weathering. Shoten gestured, and the focus slid across the surface ofthe nearer body. Above the horizon distant stars faded and twinkled.“Air!” Shoten declared. And Njord and Gomati, agreeing, “Air.” “Air.”Shoten Binayakya dropped Khons into a lower orbit, circling only one of the twinmoons, that which Gomati had arbitrarily named as Thog. Again the magnificationof the screen increased. In the center of a crater outlines appeared, forms ofstructures reared ages before by purposeful intelligence.Amazed, Njord Freyr asked, “Could there be life?”Shoten turned a metallic face toward him, shook slowly that ambiguous head. “Notnow. No movement, no radiation, no energy output. But once …” There was asilence. Breathing, whirring, the soft clicks and hums of Khons. “But once …”Shoten Binayakya said again in that cold, synthesized voice.Sri Gomati gestured. “This is where we must land. After all the explorations ofthe planets and their moons, even the futile picking among the rubbish of theAsteroid Belt by the great Astrud do Muiscos—to find signs of life at last! Thisis where we must land!”Shoten Binayakya nodded agreement without waiting even for the assent of NjordFreyr. A limb flicked out, tapped. Khons bucked and started circling downwardtoward the reticulated patterns on the surface of Thog.With a jolt and a shudder Khons settled onto the surface of the moon, wellwithin the weathered walls of the crater and within a kilometer or less of thestructured protuberances. Shoten quiesced the cyberbiots to mere maintenancelevel of Khons, leaving only the receptors and telemeters warm, then asked theothers to prepare to exit.Njord Freyr and Sri Gomati slipped breathers over their heads and shoulders.Shoten ordered a variety of internal filtration modifications within therecirculation system that provided life support. They took readings from Khons’sexternal sensors, slid back hatches, made their way from Khons, stood facingwhat, it was now obvious, were relics of incredible antiquity.Abreast, the three moved toward the ruins: Njord on motorized, gyrostabilizedcyborged wheel assemblies; Shoten Binayakya rumbling on tread-laying gear,stable, efficient; Sri Gomati striding left foot, right foot, organic legsencased in puff-jointed pressure suit like some anachronistic caricature of aBipolar Technocompetitive Era spaceman.They halted a few meters from the first row of structures. Like the crater rims,the walls, columns, arches, were weather-rounded, tumbled, softened. A metallictelescoping tentacle whiplashed out from the hub of one of Njord’scyborg-wheels. A crumbled cube of some now-soft stonelike material fell away toashes, to dust.Njord turned bleak silver eyes to the others. “Once, perhaps …”“Come along,” Gomati urged, “let’s get to exploring these ruins!” Excitementcolored her voice. “There’s no telling what evidence they may contain of theirbuilders. We may learn whether these worlds and their inhabitants originated inour own system or whether they came from—elsewhere.”At Gomati’s final word she turned her face skyward, and the others followedsuit. It was the worldlet Thog’s high noon or the equivalent of noon. The sunwas so remote—sixteen billion kilometers, twice as far as it was from Pluto atthe latter’s aphelion and 120 times as distant as it was from earth—that to thethree standing on the surface of Thog, it was utterly lost in the star-dottedblackness.But Yuggoth itself hung directly overhead, obscenely bloated and oblate, itssurface filling the heavens, looking as if it were about to crash shockinglyupon Khons and the three explorers, and all the time pulsing, pulsing, pulsinglike an atrocious heart, throbbing, throbbing. And now Thog’s twin worldlet,dubbed Thok by the female crew member, swept in Stygian silhouette across thetumultuous face of Yuggoth, Thok’s black roundness varied by the serrations ofcraterrims casting their deep shadows on the pale, pink-pulsating gray rocks ofThog.The blackness enveloped first Khons, then sped across the face of Thog, sweptover the three explorers, blotting out the pulsing ruddiness of Yuggoth andplunging them into utter blackness.Gomati’s fascination was broken by the purring synthetic voice of ShotenBinayakya. “An interesting occultation,” Shoten said, “but come, we have ourmission to perform. Khons is taking automatic measurements and telemeteringinformation back to Neptune. And here,” the silvery eyes seemed to flicker indistant starlight as a cybernetic extensor adjusted devices on the mechanicalcarapace, “my own recording and telemetering devices will send data back to theship.”[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]MARCH 15, 1937—A SNAPSHOTDr. Dustin stood by the bed. The patient was semiconscious. His lips moved, butno one could hear what he said. Two old women sat by the bed. One was his auntAnnie. The other was Annie’s dear friend Edna, present as much to comfort thegrieving aunt as to visit the dying nephew.Dr. Dustin leaned over the bed. He checked the patient’s condition. He stood fora while trying to understand the patient’s words, but he could not. From time totime the patient moved his hand feebly. It looked as if he was trying to slapsomething.The old woman named Annie had tears on her face. She reached into a worn blackpurse for her handkerchief and wiped the tears away as best she could. Shegrasped Dr. Dustin’s hand and held it between her own. She asked him, “Is thereany hope? Any?”The doctor shook his head. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Gamwell.” And to the other woman,almost bowing, “Miss Lewis.“I’m sorry,” the doctor said again.The old woman named Annie released the doctor’s hand. The other old woman, Edna,reached toward Annie. They sat facing each other. They embraced clumsily, aspeople must when sitting face to face. Each old woman tried to comfort theother.The doctor sighed and walked to the window. He looked outside. It was earlymorning. The sun had risen, but it was visible only as a pale watery glow in theeast. The sky was gray with clouds. The ground was covered with patches of snow,ice, slush. More snow was falling.The doctor wondered why it seemed that he lost patients only in winter, orduring rainstorms, or at night. Never on a bright spring or summer day. He knewthat that was not really true. Patients died when they died. When their fatalcondition, whatever it was, happened to complete the running of its course.Still, it seemed always to happen in the dark of the night or in the dark of theyear.He heard someone whistling.He turned and saw two young residents passing the doorway. One of them waswhistling. He was whistling a popular tune that the doctor had heard on theradio. He couldn’t remember what program he had heard it on. Possibly theprogram was “The Kate Smith Show” or “Your Hit Parade.” The tune was verycatchy, even though the words were in some language that eluded Dr. Dustin’sear. The song was called “Bei Mir Bist du Schön.”Three thousand miles away, the Spanish were engaged in a confusing civil war.The old king had abdicated years before, and a republic had been proclaimed. Butafter the direction of the new government became clear, a colonel serving in theSpanish colonial forces in Africa returned with his troops—largely Berbers andRifs—to change things.He would overthrow the republic. He would end the nonsense of democracy,atheism, lewdness, that the republic tolerated. He would restore discipline,piety, modesty. He would reinstitute the monarchy.At the moment it appeared that the republican forces were winning. They had justrecaptured the cities of Trijuque and Guadalajara. They had taken rebelprisoners. These included Spanish monarchists. They included African troops aswell. Strangely, some of the prisoners spoke only Italian. They said they werevolunteers. They said they had been ordered to volunteer. And they always obeyedtheir orders.In China, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army were having easy going. Theiropposition was weak. The Chinese were divided. They had been engaged in a civilwar. It was not much like the one in Spain. It had been going on much longer. Ithad begun with the death of President Sun Yat-sen in 1924. The Japanese were notthe only foreign power to intervene in China.Germany had owned trading concessions in China until the Treaty of Versaillesended them. Germany was burgeoning now and had ambitions to regain her lostprivileges.Other countries had felt their interests threatened by the Chinese civil war.England had sent troops. France had used her influence. France was worried thatshe might lose her valuable colonies in Indochina. Russia had tried to influenceChina’s internal politics. There had been grave danger of war between Russia andChina. Especially when the Chinese sacked the Russian Embassy in Beijing andbeheaded six of its staff.The United States had intervened. American gunboats plied Chinese waterways. Thegunboat Panay was sunk by aerial gunfire and bombing. The Panay was on theYangtze river when this happened. The Yangtze is a Chinese river. But the Panaywas sunk by Japanese forces. This pleased China. Japan apologized and paidcompensation.Joe Louis and Joe DiMaggio, two young athletes, were in training. Both of themhad very good years in 1937.A wealthy daredevil pilot named Howard Hughes flew across the United States inseven hours and twenty-eight minutes. This set off a new wave of excitement and“air-mindedness.” In Santa Monica, California, the Douglas Aircraft Company wascompleting its new airliner. This would carry forty passengers. It had fourengines. It would be capable of speeds up to 237 miles per hour.More conservative people felt that the zeppelin would never yield to theairplane. The great airship Hindenburg was on the Atlantic run. It was huge. Itwas beautiful. There was a piano in its cocktail lounge. The European terminusof its flights was Tempelhof Airdrome in Germany. The American terminus of itsflights was Lakehurst, New Jersey.On the morning of March 15, Rabbi Louis I. Newman found eleven large orangeswastikas painted on the walls of Temple Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83rd Street, NewYork. This was the third such incident at Temple Rodeph Sholom. Rabbi Newmansuspected that the swastikas were painted in retaliation for Secretary of StateHull’s protests against abusive statements in the German press.At Turn Hall, Lexington Avenue and 85th Street, the head of the Silver Shirts ofNew York replied. His name was George L. Rafort. He said the swastikas werepainted by Jewish troublemakers. He knew this because the arms of the elevenswastikas pointed backward. He said, “This is a mistake no Nazi would make.”In Providence, Rhode Island, the snow continued to fall. The city’s hills wereslippery. There were accident cases in the hospitals.In the Jane Brown Memorial Hospital on College Hill, Howard Lovecraft opened hiseyes. No one knew what he saw. Certainly Dr. Cecil Calvert Dustin did not.Howard slapped the coverlet of his bed. He moved his lips. A sound emerged. Hemight have said, “Feather.” Perhaps he had been slapping at an errant feather.Or perhaps the word was “Father.” He might have said, “Father, you look justlike a young man.”[images/Love_9780307547903_epub_L04_r1.jpg]MARCH 15, 2337They rolled, clanked, strode forward a few meters more, halted once again at thevery edge of the ancient ruins. Shoten Binayakya sent two core samplers downwardfrom mechanized instrumentation compartments, one to sample soil, the other toclip some material from the ruins themselves. Carbon dating would proceedautomatically within Shoten’s cyborged componentry.Sri Gomati gazed at the ruins. They had the appearance, in the faint distantstarlight, of stairs and terraces walled with marble balustrades. Gomati ran heroptical sensors to maximum image amplification to obtain meaningful sight in thedarkness of the occultation of Yuggoth.And then—it is highly doubtful that the discovery would have been made by thesingle brief expedition, working in the ruddy, pulsating light of Yuggoth, itwas surely that planet’s occultation by Thok that must receive credit for thefind—Comati turned at the gasp of Njord Freyr. Her eyes followed the path of hispointing, armor-gauntleted hand.From some opening deep under the rubble before them a dim but baleful lightemerged, pulsating obscenely. But unlike the crimson pulsations of Yuggoth abovethe explorers, this light beneath their feet was of some shocking, awful green.Without speaking the three surged forward, picking their way through the ruinedand crumbled remnants of whatever ancient city had once flung vaulted towers andfluted columns into the black sky above the tiny world. They reached the sourceof the radiance barely in time, for as the disk sped across the face of Yuggoth,the black shadow that blanketed the landing site of the ship Khons and the ruinswhere the crew poked and studied, fled across the pale gray face of Thog leavingthem standing once more in the red pulsating glare of the giant planet.In the obscene half-daylight, the hideous metallic glare of bronze-green wasoverwhelmed and disappeared into the general throbbing ruddiness. But by nowShoten Binayakya had shot a telescoping core-probe into the opening from whichthe light emerged, and with mechanical levers pried back the marblelike slabwhose cracked and chipped corner had permitted the emergence of the glow.Servos revved, the stone slab crashed aside. Steps led away, into the bowels ofthe worldlet Thog. In the dark, shadowy recess the red pulsating light of giantYuggoth and the baleful metallic green fought and shifted distressingly.“The Chooric zone,” Sri Comati whispered to herself, “the Chooric zone.”They advanced down the stairs, leaving behind the baleful pulsations of Yuggoth,lowering themselves meter by meter into the bronze-green lighted depths of Thog.The track-laying cybermech of Shoten Binayakya took the strangely proportionedstairway with a sort of clumsy grace. Njord Freyr, his wheeled undercarriagesuperbly mobile on the level surface of Thog, now clutched desperately to thefluted carapace of Shoten.Sri Comati walked with ease, gazing out over the subsurface world of Thog.Seemingly kilometers below their entry a maze of dome on dome and tower on towerlay beside—she shook her head, adjusted metallic optics. There seemed to be asubterranean sea here within the depths of tiny Thog, a sea whose dark and oilywaters lapped and gurgled obscenely at a black and gritty beach.At the edge of that sea, that body which must be little more than a lake byearthly standards, on that black and grainy beach, great terrible creaturesrolled and gamboled shockingly.“Shoggoths!” Sri Gomati ran ahead of the others, almost tumbling from theunbalustraded stairway. “Shoggoths! Exactly as he said, splashing beside a foullake! Shoggoths!” Exalted, she reached the end of the stairway, ran throughtowering columns past walls of sprawling bas-relief that showed hideous deitiesdestroying intruders upon their shrines while awful acolytes crept away towardenigmatic vehicles in search of morsels to appease their obscene gods.Gomati heard the grinding, clanking sounds of Shoten Binayakya following her,the steady whir of Njord Freyr’s undercarriage. She turned and faced them. “Thisis the year 2337,” she shouted, “the four hundredth anniversary of his death!How could he know? How could he ever have known?”And she ran down hallways beneath vaulted gambrel roofs, ran past more carvingsand paintings showing strange, rugose cone-shaped beings and terrible,tentacle-faced obscenities that loomed frighteningly above cowering prey. ThenGomati came to another hallway, one lit with black tapers that flared andguttered terribly.The air in the room was utterly still, the shadows of fluted columns solemnagainst walls carved and lettered in a script whose awesome significance hadbeen forgotten before earth’s own races were young. And in the center of theroom, meter-tall tapers of Stygian gloom marking its four extremities, stood acatafalque, and on the catafalque, skin as white as a grave-worm, eyes shut,angular features in somber repose, lay the black-draped figure of a man.Sri Gomati raced to the foot of the catafalque, stood gazing into the flickeringdarkness of the hall, then advanced to stand beside the head of the body. Hersilvery eyes shimmered and she began to laugh, to giggle and titter obscenely,and yet to weep at the same time, for some cybersurgeon long before had seen fitto leave those glands and ducts intact.And Sri Gomati stood tittering and snuffling until Njord Freyr rolled beside heron his cyborged power-wheels and the ambiguous Shoten Binayakya ground andclanked beside her on tread-laying undercarriage, and they took her to return tothe spaceship Khons.But strangest of all is this. The stairway by which they attempted to return tothe surface of the worldlet Thog and the safety of their spaceship Khons hadcrumbled away under the weight of untold eons and that of the cybermechanisms ofthe exploration party, and when they tried to climb those crumbling stairs theyfound themselves trapped in the Ghooric zone kilometers beneath the surface ofthe worldlet Thog.And there, beside the oily, lapping sea, the foul lake where puffed shoggothssplash, they remained, the three, forever.* Originally published in Chrysalis, 1977."},{"pageContent":"The H.
