Most of them were written in the 1993-1995 period (which along with the Green Book volumes 2 & 3 in the Summer of 93, and ARDA) mark this as a period of high literary output. This period is reasonably separate from the 1963-1979 period of earlier-day Druidism, so I have chosen to call it latter-day Druidism. The title is also a slight humorous poke at Mormon- ism. There are three main categories that group the contents of part nine; 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.

Songs and Poetry Songs and Poetry Songs and Poetry Songs and Poetry Songs and Poetry The Book of Songs and Poetry, Volume 1 (Published July 93) The Book of Songs and Poetry, Volume 2 (Published Dec. 93) My literary explosion began after reading the long-neglected materials of the Druid Archives and seeing the sheer possibilities of Reformed Dru- idism. All this was taking place during the May 93 to May 94 period when I was Arch-Druid. I figured that I am better at writing than at leading rituals (although I did hold an unusually large number of rituals), so I spent much of my energies went into producing literature that might out- live my physical presence at Carleton. I also had a great number of things to say, and this was a good time to write them down. Each book has been individually published before, but this is the first time they have all been published together. Please enjoy them, do not consider them dogma and share with your friends.

I resolved to leave behind some type of document to cover the more recent history. It turned out that my comprehensive project would be on Reformed Druid- ism, so the relevance of this document is no longer as a quick sum- mary, but as an insight into Druidism at Carleton in the early 90s during my active Arch-Druidcy of May 93 to May 94. The Dead Lake Scrolls received little if any attention from most of my fellow Grove members, but the Hazelnut Grove loved them and wrote The Dead Bay Scrolls in response. I therefore publish them both, hoping that some wisdom will be found in them by the reader. As with all Reformed Druidic material, none of this is to be con- sidered to be rigid dogma or unassailable truth. Read it in the light- hearted spirit that it was written in. —Scharding Publishing History Publishing History Publishing History Publishing History Publishing History 1st Printing - Summer 93 2nd Printing - Summer 96 (with ARDA) The Book of Introduction The Book of Introduction The Book of Introduction The Book of Introduction The Book of Introduction Chapter the First 1. I tell you the Carleton Druids are truly a marvelous exercise in religious faith. What other group on campus is as dedicated to loving nature and that encourages diversity of religious beliefs? 2. The knowledge gleaned from the practitioners of the Druidic outlook, is worthy of being written down; both for entertain- ment and the chance it may enlighten someone. 3. I highly encourage others to add to this work with their own writings on miraculous occurrences, insights gained and beau- ties observed while at Carleton or elsewhere. Poetry and songs would be a welcome addition. 4. The title of this work makes an oblique reference to the state of Lyman Lakes. Chapter the Second 1.

How did the Druids at Carleton progress over the last thirty years? Sit down and I will tell you so that you may see the larger picture of the Reformed movement. 2 For it is in knowing the Past, that the present becomes clear. Chapter the Second 1. The Years of Peace The Years of Peace The Years of Peace The Years of Peace The Years of Peace (1963-1968 c.e.) were spent in happy isola- tion at Carleton’s newly founded Grove. None knew of the grow- ing neo-pagan movement then. They only concerned themselves with removing the odious religious requirements and partaking of the waters of life. They researched and solidified a vague philo- sophic system and hierarchy. 2. The Groves of Vermilion and Rapid City, SD were founded by Nelson and disappeared. Likewise with the Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan, Wisc and New York Grove the First by Frangquist and Fisher. 3. The favorite ritual sites of the Druids, until the Years of Explora- tion, was the Hill of Three Oaks, Computer Center and Monu- ment Hill. 4. Read the Druid Chronicles to learn more. Chapter the Third 1. The Years of Growth The Years of Growth The Years of Growth The Years of Growth The Years of Growth (1968-1974 c.e.) started with the found- ing of the Berkeley College Grove, from where Robert Larson and Isaac Bonewits did take their knowledge of neo-paganism. 2. These two did also found the Twin Cities Grove and the Stock- ton Grove. 3. Elsewhere, the RDNA of Carleton College did found the Chi- cago, the Ann Arbor and the Stanford Groves under Glenn McDavid, Conway and Savitzky. 4. Carleton spent many of these years growing larger after an ini- tial plunge in membership. All of the major publications and codification were finished by this point including the Green Book of meditations, the Apocrypha and Liturgy. Chapter the Fourth 1. The Years of Pain The Years of Pain The Years of Pain The Years of Pain The Years of Pain (1974-1976 c.e.) were started by Bonewits’ letter to the Council of Dalon Ap Landu (which is all the third order priests) declaring that the RDNA was in fact an “eclectic, Neopagan & Reconstructionist Priestcraft.” 2. Many did rend their hair over his terminology! Many were ex- ceedingly wroth with each other. See the Orange Book of the Apocrypha and and and and and the Book of the Apocrypha found in Bonewits’ version of the Druid Chronicles for their words. 3. Since the current Carleton Archdruid was seemingly out of touch, so they wanted to assume a rotating head for the Council of Dalon Ap Landu. 4. A vote was taken: most of the Carleton graduates voted against it, most Californians voted for it. 5. A split developed and the New RDNA was formed. 6. The Yellow Book of The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) was pub- lished and the Orange Book of the Carleton Apocrypha was completed but unpublished. Chapter the Fifth 1. The Years of the Decline The Years of the Decline The Years of the Decline The Years of the Decline The Years of the Decline (1976-1980 c.e.) were the result of problems with the transition of the ArchDruidcy, although Donald Morrison is not to blame, a general decrease in mysticism was. 2. The fermentative years of the Vietnam war were over and were in the oil crisis. It was not years to be rebellious any more, for Lo!, women and men could drink and sleep in the same dorms now. We were sorely preoccupied with these new pleasures. 3. Likewise, college students could vote now instead of protest. 4. The group withered away and lost touch with the others. Chapter the Sixth 1. The Years of the Occlusion The Years of the Occlusion The Years of the Occlusion The Years of the Occlusion The Years of the Occlusion (1980-1982 c.e.) were years in which few druids over the second order existed. Occasional calls to past Druids gained no real support. 2. For Yea!, these were the start of the Reagan years, and what enthusiasm could any Druid have? Chapter the Seventh 1. The Years of the Revival The Years of the Revival The Years of the Revival The Years of the Revival The Years of the Revival (1982-1985 c.e.) were thus called since David Frangquist returned to Carleton College to ordain Tom & Meg. 2. A weak resumption of the old ways were resumed while the Earth-mother nurtured the returning Druidism. Chapter the Eighth 1. The Years of the Exploration The Years of the Exploration The Years of the Exploration The Years of the Exploration The Years of the Exploration (1985-1990 c.e.) were a result of a break with the third order and the firm introduction of neo- pagan students (& their wisdom) into Carleton. 2. The students did pursue new areas of study, especially in the study of the wisdom of the Lakota. 3. Sweatlodges and nudity were introduced. 4. Waters-of-Life were laid to the side, mostly because they were dangerous with the aforesaid practices. 5. Great Fires blazed at these rituals. One such fire-leader was Joe, whose famous quote rings out through the ages: “Lo! But it is not a real fire until I burn my beard!” 6. Farmhouse was the center of this revival. Many of their names may be found on the “family tree” in Farmhouse on the second floor to this day. The site of choice was the Oak Opening in the lower Arb. 7. The Grove of St. Olaf was started and remained small under Sam’s loving care. Chapter the Ninth 1. The Years of Chaos The Years of Chaos The Years of Chaos The Years of Chaos The Years of Chaos (1990-1993 c.e.) were not a fault of the ArchDruid, Andrea the Fair, but rather because the mainstays of the group had all graduated, or dropped out of school. 2. There were many insider quarrels that did rend apart the group, and although none wished to be the leader, they quarreled any- way. 3. Pagan Studies did stop meeting and Catalyst under Salem and Celia did help to hold the group together. Especially in bringing in the members of the class of ’95. Chapter the Tenth 1. The Year of Order The Year of Order The Year of Order The Year of Order The Year of Order (1993-1994 c.e.) was then established when Mike the Fool did decide to bring back a modicum of dogma to the group. 2. The Third order did return to Carleton as may be found in the Book of Vigils and many did return to the pleasures of vigiling. (See Book of Vigils) 3. Documents of the past and certain rituals returned from the Archives. 4. The Basic plan was to give a group structure, teach the history and customs, make documents accessible, to encourage all Druid to try and lead a ritual or group exercise, and provide help in finding spiritual groups outside the Carleton after graduation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"398 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB 5. Then was the Naples Grove of Florida was founded by Kyle Jemair Clark under Mike & Sam’s tutelage. Chapter the Eleventh 1. The Years of Legitimacy The Years of Legitimacy The Years of Legitimacy The Years of Legitimacy The Years of Legitimacy (1994-?) did begin and great was ap- prehension. 2. For how can a group based on being the rebellious outsider survive, when it is now accepted by the Institution? 3. This process did perplex the Druids of Carleton for many de- cades and they wisely chose not to register with the authorities that be. 4. But, in the mid 80s, the quest for cash led them into closer cahoots with the authorities that be and “Pagan Studies” was founded to garner money. 5. Many discussion groups and lecture luncheons with Druids and others were funded by Pagan Studies. 6. But Pagan Studies faded, as must all institutions. 7. Up arose another young organizer, Michael being his name, and another front organization was founded to garner money, and Friends of the Earth Mother at Carleton College was its name. 8. FOEMACC did bring in the loot and much wax, whiskey and magazines were purchased, and this brought joy to the hearts of the Druids. 9. Yet there was still apprehension in the hearts of the older Dru- ids. 10 And the day did come in the 33rd year of the Reform (May 1995), in which Becky the Grinner did say unto the other chil- dren of the Earth Mother; “Why do we not dispose of FOEMACC and seek to garner money directly, yea, even under the very same name as ‘Druids’?” 11. And for the first time in 33 years, our petition for legitimacy was accepted and the Druids were no longer the rebels on the out- side of the Institution. 12 Or are they? The Book on John Burridge by Mike the Fool Chapter the First 1. It was a dark and stormy night when I first saw John. I was casually strolling by the music building on campus. 2. Suddenly, I saw two green lights flying towards me. They did neither bob nor sway, but straight at me they did come. 3. Just when I thought they would impale me, a figure in a purple and black cloak roller-bladed shuttled by me, yelling “Aiiyyyeeee!.....Zoom!” 4. That was John and it was sign. Chapter the Second 1. John was a spiritual guru for me and taught me to play the harp. Sine Ceolbhinn, my harp, is an identical twin of his harp. John loved Hostess Ho-Hos, M&Ms, and Caffeine. 2. He lived in a spiritually powerful house with peeling orange paint called “Orange Awareness House.” It was the second old- est house in all of Northfield. Many Druids had lived there in- cluding Jon, Dave, Andrea and John. 3. All the Druids did work in the computer center and were VAX geeks. John was the geekiest of them all. 4. His long sable hair had streaks of silver in them, and his tall, nervous, slender figure enjoyed dancing and chasing squirrels. Truly his real name was “Moonhawk Studmuffin.” Chapter the Third 1. Truly did all the Druids love John and his cat, Machka. 2. One day, John became the victim of an evil squirrel. 3. Photon, for that was his nickname, was rollerblading along near Sayles, when he spotted a squirrel who had strayed too far from a tree. 4. He switched into turbo-mode and did strive to grab the squirrel. Verily, he could just about reach its fuzzy tail as its feet madly pounded the earth. 5. Earth became gravel... 6. The gravel caught the roller-blade wheels... 7. His feet stopped, but his body didn’t. 8. He hurdled through a bush and broke his wrist. 9. The safe squirrel laughed from the tree top, he having planned it all. 10. A song was composed by Ann to the tune of “Dona Dona” as found in the Rise Up Singing Book used at Picking N Grinning: 11. “On a stretcher bound from Northfield Lies a man with a mournful eye. High above him, in a tree top, Laughs a squirrel from on high... chorus: How the squirrels are laughing! They laugh with all their might Laugh and laugh the whole night through... and (clap!) Half that April night. Dona Dona Dona etc. Squirrels are easily bound and slaughtered Never knowing the reason why But if you chase squirrels o’er gravel You will fall and you might die!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"399 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB Chapter the Fourth 1. Aye! Did not every tear fill with sorrow when John had to leave from Carleton College. In their eyes the very color had left the world 2. He was a victim of the most evil lord of the computer center, Carl, who did purge the office of ‘unneeded’ ones. 3. A great party surrounded the parting of John, over two score were present at Orange House. Many strange things did occur at that party, including a strange GREEN drink. 4. He then did leave, and then Druidism slumped at this college, having lost its most promising new leader, one who was not a student in fact. Chapter the Fifth 1. Not long after, Orange Awareness House itself was razed by yellow beasts that belched smoke. 2. John now resides in south Arizona at a Commune known as Arcosanti, a place where a mediocre Sci-Fi movie, NIGHTFALL, was filmed. 3. Machka Burridge, John’s owner, is with him there too, and she is doing well. 4. Here ends the Book on John Burridge. The Book of Opposition by Mike the Fool Chapter the First 1. As the Reagan/Bush years progressed, the intolerance of reli- gions, especially mystical ones has increased at Carleton. 2. Yea, there were far more fundies than you can shake a stick at, Danu bless their small minds. 3. And here are some of their notorious deeds, names have not been hid to hide the guilty. Chapter the Second 1. It was a bright, sunny day of April 10th, 1993 c.e. when Andrea the Fair and Mike the Busy did go up to the Hill of two Oaks to thank the Earth for its blessings in an Erisian fashion. 2. There were two people there, and since Mike had well adver- tised the time and place throughout the college, he assumed they were there for the ritual. 3. All removed broken glass from the Hill’s green bosom. 4. The two people, Paul R. and Jason B., did leave with friendly remarks, indeed nothing seemed amiss. 5. Yea, but a Griffin did also mount the hill with the splendor of his red locks of hair. He said ‘hi’ and left. Mike took it as a sign. 6. Mike and Andrea did don the most sacred Cone-Hats of bright colors and the mystical handpuppets of John Burridge. They did dance around intoning ‘Beep-Beep’ mantras. Chapter the Third 1. The ritual was mostly done (see order or worship) and Mike was reading a meditation, when Paul R, strode up and declared: 2. “I have come to tell you that you dance before false gods, who will crumble into dust before the superior might of my God on the Final Day of Judgment, and I will see you burn in the Flames of Hell as a result of your worship!!!” He then returned to Monu- ment Hill where a prayer service was being held. 3. Andrea turned to Mike and said “What the Hell was that?” but Mike did not know at first. 4. Mike finished the service and pondered on Andrea’s words as she returned to Goodhue. “At first I thought he was just being an asshole, but then later I realized it was harassment.” Mike later was prone to say. Chapter the Fourth 1. Mike did decide to reason with this Anti-Druid, but this is diffi- cult, for Anti-Druids deny the validity of any view but their own. 2. Mike did reason with all his might against the great Anti-Druid encampment. He received an “apology” from Paul, “I didn’t want to do it, but God told me to do it.” Humph! 3. Mike was unable to coax an assurance that Paul would not inter- fere with the 30th anniversary ritual on the next week. 4. Mike did beseech upon the authorities for protection, but a le- galistic loophole in the Carleton list of student rights did not feel that students had a right not to be harassed for racial, ethnic or religious background. 5. Mike did spit forth angry recriminations. Had these baboons missed the 60’s all together? Were they maliciously stupid?! 6. Mike indeed did lose his contenance, which is oft ill befitting a Druid. Chapter the Fifth 1. Posters had been put up on walls by fundies all this year and last, proclaiming the glory and superiority of the Christian faith. A fish (with John Burridge), c. 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"400 2. Many of the said posters were removed by enlightened people, yeah! 3. Mike and others did fill the spring Carletonian paper with ar- ticles about freedom of religion and tolerance for race. 4. But was this the only time the Anti-Druids have acted? Nay! Listen and I will tell you of what I have learned. Chapter the Sixth 1. Dave and others have told me of many persistent conversion attempts. 2. While preparing wood for a Beltane fire in the Oak Grove in 1990, I did stumble upon a group of pale people dressed in white in silent meditation. They replaced our maypole with a 8' cross. 3. A few times we’ve arrived at a ritual site only to find the ground LITTERED with strewn crosses. 4. The cross at Monument Hill, is not the work of Anti-Druids, but merely a religious shrine. It has been there since 1987, you should not remove it. Treat it as a symbol for the four directions. 5. Sam, Heather, Alex and I were having a sweatlodge and vigil in May 1992 on the Hill. As we were relaxing in the nude, in be- tween sweats, a contingent of party-fiends did overrun the Hill. They would not leave nor wait 10 minutes! For they had the Hill of Oaks reserved and we did not and we were forced to pull up our stakes and finish at the Little Grove. 6. Read the Druid Chronicles for Anti-Druid activities. Also see the Book of Vigils. Chapter the Seventh 1. I will now tell you how to deal with Anti-Druids. 2. If you enter arguments with them, you will seem to lose, since their rules to win prevent them from accepting yours. 3. But do not wage war with them, but meet their arguments with compassion, for many a fundie is suffering from insecurity. Rea- soning will not get them to abandon their only anchor, that they have found the ONLY way, and are thus saved, and that you damned. 4. Beware of rousing them. The Public will sympathize as long as you are not shown to be the aggressor. 5. Never announce the site nor time of a ritual via the Carletonian, NNB or in the VAX Notes Conference. All these are publicly accessible and may encourage attacks. 6. Never allow mailing lists to fall into the hands of non-druids. 7. Stuffing the mailboxes is safest. 8. Archdruids, meet with all druid-wannabes to sniff out spies, for we’ve had them before, and we’ll have them again. Meeting with them also encourages the real Druids-wannabes into participa- tion. 9. Always reserve the site at the Campus Activities Office, if you fear interruption. If the register looks funny at you, say you’re reserving the FIRE-RING at the site. Of course, the Anti-Druids could also read that reservation book to find you. 10. Many of the Fundy groups have taken to outdoor services, this is good. That’s OK. Avoid running into them. 11. Having a person be a “guardian” to detour drunks and bad tempered fiends often helps a ritual. The Preceptor should take any divine “messages” and deliver them, after the ritual is fin- ished. 12. Do not fear bringing them up on charges. First you must tell the Dean of Students of the problem. He will write to the offender with an official warning. If the warned person repeats their be- havior then you have a case against them. If you don’t complain the first time, you can not smite the person the second time! 13. Remember, security is on your side if they start a fight. 14. However, the Anti-Druids could say you were nude or giving alcohol to under-21 year olds. So practice these with caution. 15. If this sounds paranoiaic, then ignore it, for you must live in an age at Carleton where students have resumed civiility in their discourse to eachother. You are blessed. 16. So ends this Book."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"401 The Book of Post Scripts: Part One by Mike the Fool Chapter the First 1. It was April 17th, 1993 when the Druids did gather at Monu- ment Hill, where all that started did occur, to celebrate thirty years of Druidism at this college. It was a sunny day and all did agree it was a gift from the Earth-mother. 2. And Lo!, Richard, an Arch Druid of 1971 c.e., was present and did lead us in the order of worship. For at that time there were no third order priests at the college. (Nor had there been since 1984, though many did the work without being able to be or- dained.) 3. And Lo!, Michael, who was but a chick in an egg with his Dru- idism, was the preceptor, for he knew the stuff cold! 4. And Lo!, others did show up. And their numbers were counted as four people. They were the one called Blake (of the Sci-Fi club), the one called Hannah (of the dazzling cuteness), the one called Paul (of the blond hair) and the one called Nikki (known for her wardrobe). Many more had decided to sleep late or to play Frisbee. 5. Squirrels, birds, deer and bugs were also there in attendance, although they were not always visible nor audible. 6. No Anti-Druid dared to disturb this most momentous occasion, for Michael had taken many precautions and had set up power- ful wards. 7. The ritual went well, and wise words and stories were told from the wise ones of the middle-east. The difference between a cam- els and its rider can be confusing! 8. After the ritual, many did go to the Hill of Two (or three oaks) and did partake of food & Tang while watching the fierce Frisbee teams vie for supremacy. Chapter the Second 1. Not long after Beltaine, Sam, an ArchDruid of St.Olaf since 1987, and Michael the Fool, did decide to undertake the duties of the office of ArchDruids for the period of time of Beltaine 1993 to Beltaine 1994. 2. These two druids did dress up and carried their ensouled musi- cal instruments (“Stormus” the Bodhran and “Sine Ceolbhinn” the Harp) and flaming brands to the top of the Hill of Two oaks on a moony night. 3. They were enraged to find a sleeping person already on the Hill. Where else could they hold their ritual? What to do? 4. Michael said to Sam that they should build a circle of stones around this victim, who had apparently offered himself as a sac- rifice. But Sam saith to Mike, “Nay, that would get us in trouble.” 5. Mike also wished to pin a note to the sleeper that said “Sorry, but we didn’t need you for a human sacrifice after all, thanks though!” But Sam, full of wisdom, said unto Mike, “Nay, that would get us in trouble!” 6. Mike and Sam did mosey unto the Hill of Monument, whose blank fourth side reflects upon our dogma, and they did dance around the obelisk until they became ArchDruids of Carleton and St. Olaf respectively (and quite dizzy!) and they did ask for wisdom and a sign of blessing. 7. And Lo!, next morning when Mike mounted the Hill of Two Oaks on the next morning, to give thanks to the sunrise, there were now THREE trees present! 8. Once, this Hill bore three oaks, but many years past, a lightning bolt did blast this third tree reducing it to a stump. Rain and the Grounds Crew further had reduced this stump to a depression on the Hill. Many gentiles thought they saw three trees, but were mistaken, for one tree was split into two trunks and deceived many people. 9. Mike had planted many acorns on the site afore this time, but here was a new oak tree, 3 men tall, sprung forth from the earth over night. It was not far from where the previous tree had stood. 10. He did fall to the ground and gave many thanks for this sign from the Earth-Mother of her love for her Druids. 11. Later, Mike realized that the Earthmother had worked through the Carleton alumni of the Men’s rugby team and their treeplanting memorial fund, but that did not detract from the miracle. 11. Here Paul, of the dazzling blond hair, doth add comments of his own wisdom:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"402 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB The Book of Paul: Part One Chapter the First 1. Shortly following the arrival of the new oak, the foliage of all the arboretum did shower forth their blessings unto the new oak. 2. Mike, the most-knowledgeable, did collect the offerings for the oak and did skillfully weave them into a ring of life and bless- ings. 3. Herewith did the two elder oaks contribute to that ring. With familial support, Mike and Paul braved the dizzying heights of the oaks to collect their leaf offerings. 4. Yea, they were like unto squirrels! 5. With the offering to the fledgling oak complete, Mike and Paul did proceed with a ritual of goodwill and blessing. 6. After completing the noon-ish ritual under the gaze of the be- nevolent sun, and with the support of the Hill of Three Oaks, a libation from the waters of life was imparted unto the oak. 7. The oak did quickly drink from the waters and, with minimal coaxing, persuaded the two nearby ape descendants to bathe it with more powers of life. 8. Immediately after the oak had consumed all Druidic nourish- ment available, a strange wanderer did appear, and he did stare with wonderment and delight upon the healthy new oak. 9. Lo!, the powers of the Earth Mother surged through the oak and it did shine with glory. 10. So sayeth Paul, the mighty.

Verily, the third order has languished over the last 15 years. Problems with over devotion to the Waters-of-Life, led to a lack of devotion to the Druids. Beware, ye!, the curse of over-devo- tion! The next ArchDruid, Katya was unable to fix the damage and went into Occlusion. 2. From 1980 to 1982, the years of occlusion, few above 1st order did roam these sacred groves. Great was their despondency! Lam- entations did pour forth from those who sought guidance. A weak call for help did ensue, and yea!, it was answered by a David’s love! He did travel forth to fix the damage done. 3. David the Chronicler, did return in 1982 to revive a languish- ing group at Carleton. Tom, Bob, and Margaret, newly of the 3rd order, did lead the group until 1984 during these Years of Revival. Yet, sadly, none followed these Druids into the third order. 4. Druidism slept at Carleton until the visit by Selena Fox and her husband Dennis in 1985. Many did attend her lecture and ate at FarmHouse, where a feast was thrown for in her honor. 5. Earlier, Curtis and Paul (who was a Glover) had found Isaac’s Druid Chronicles in the basement. But they knew not what to make of Druidism, but some pyrotechnic rites and stuffed toy dinosaurs were applied to the problem, to the amusement of all. 6. Heiko, the dark haired, did show Selena of this book, and she imparted unto them the basic history of the RDNA. Many de- sired to restart this group, but there was no Druid initiate then known. All despaired. 7. Then, by luck or fate, Alice (the good person) did pass by and stated that she was an initiate of the Druids of the second order, or at least of the first order. All did jump up in amazement and asked her for the story of how this event had come to be. She said unto them: 8. “In my freshmen year, the ArchDruid did reside in Burton, on the highest floor thereof, which I and my friends did also reside upon. Their names were Judith and Maggie. 9. “One night, that Druid asked us, ‘Do you wisheth to be Druids, fair ones?’ We replied back unto him “Verily, we do!” We went to the Hill of Three Oaks and were initiated by that same ArchDruid, who wore a blue bathrobe. He told us ‘I don’t want you to take this too seriously’. That is my story.” 10. All who did listern thereunto did run up to the Hill of Three Oaks. When they had mounted the skybound hilltop, they saw thereon a Stag and a Doe of marvelous beauty. But as they did approach, the two deer had vanished! Each took this in their own way. Many did enter the second order on that night. 11. Unable to bring back another Third Order Druid to ‘properly’ initiate them, any Druid who led a ritual was considered a third order, and should be respected by all as such. If they so desireth now, they may return for a formal ordination. 12. What did the third order mean before the Years of Exploration? It meant that you vigiled overnight and were initiated by a third order priest with the third order ritual, one that has not been changed since 1965. Back then, only third order priests could lead a ritual, vote on the board of Dalon Ap Landu, received a copy of the annual report from succeeding Archdruids, and were the only ones allowed to initiate a 2nd or 3rd order Druid. 13. What does the third order mean in the Year of Order (1993 to 1994)? It means you have spent a night vigiling in the woods in meditation and was initiated by a 3rd order priest with third order ritual, one that has never be changed since 1965. You will then receive a copy of the annual report from succeeding ArchDruids and are allowed to initiate a 3rd Order Druid. You will also vote on the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, if it is ever revived. 14. According to our new tradition, Second order Druids may ini- tiate 2nd and 1st order Druids with either the official formula or with a made-up version. Second orders can lead rituals. 15. According to our new tradition, First order Druids are anyone whose ever shown up at a ritual and may initiate anyone else into the 1st order. First orders can lead rituals. 16. The 4th through 7th orders are essentially closed, and will prob- ably never be accessible again. Oh, well, big deal Chapter the Fourth 1. You may ask, “What happened to our Groves, which were scat- tered across the country?” I will tell you. 2. During the 70’s, the ones led by Isaac Bonewits did break with the RDNA and were known as the New Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA) and as the Schismatic Druids of North America (SDNA), Hassidic Druids of North America (HDNA), the Other Druids of North America (ODNA) and the Zen Dru- ids of North America (ZDNA). In 1979, all these groups changed back their designation back to NRDNA. 3. During the 80’s, a few groves led by Isaac Bonewits did break with the NRDNA and mutated into a grim, scholastic group known as Ar nDraoicht Fein (“Our own Druidism”). They did much research on Paleo-paganism in Indo-European cultures. 4. During the later 80’s, a few groups led by Pat and Tony Taylor did break with the Ar nDraoicht Fein and formed the lighthearted Henge of Keltria, which concentrates almost exclusively upon Celtic Paleo-pagan culture. 5. Today all four groups still survive; the RDNA, NRDNA, ADF and the Henge of Keltria. Rejoice in the Druid Sigil, that all do honor! 6. What does this symbol, found on the altar stone upon the Hill of Three oaks mean? 7. Some say its a floor plan of a temple in Stuart Piggots book. In which case it should have a square around it. 8. Some say the circle represents the year, whose left and right lines part the winter and summer half, being the two days of Samhain and Beltane. 9. Some say that the Druid symbol is a Yunic symbol, in other words, a representation of a vagina. 10. Regardless of what it is, it is a symbol of Reformed Druidism to the world! 11. So ends the Book of Post-(s)Crypts, Part II."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"405 The Book of Vigils by Mike the Fool & Sine Ceolbhinn Chapter the First 1. A vigil is an important marker in one’s spiritual quest for reli- gious truth. Therefore any vigiler’s story may inspire someone to undertake this mystery of vigiling. 2. What is a vigil? It is the spending (at least) seven hours in the outdoors at night, awake and not speaking unto another. A vigil is mandatory for entering the third order. 3. At dawn, the ordination to the third order is delivered unto the vigiler by another Third Order Druid. Chapter the Second 1. Not long after the planting of the new tree, Mike did undertake the vigil for the third order. In preparation, the dilapidated pen- tagonal sweatlodge (near FarmHouse) was razed by Mike and Paul, of the long limbs. 2. Much wood was salvaged. A story of its magical origins is there- fore appropriate: 3. Not long after the Years of the Exploration (1985-90) began, Heiko, Paul (a Glover) and Jan decided to build the sweatlodge by FarmHouse, where they could sweat. 4. On the soft, dewy morning, of which they would begin con- struction, they did leave FarmHouse and looked upon the site. 5. There grazing on the spot was a white Stag. Others say it was a Stag and a Doe. This vision then did vanish. Lo! 6. They took this as a sign, each in their own way. 7. Paul, the blond, and Mike, the fool, did take this wood of Sweatlodge to the Little Grove (also known as the Druid Den) near the Hill of at least Three Oaks. By the Earth-mother!, did not the fires from the old sweatlodge not leap 20 feet in the air, ALL NIGHT! 8. That night (may 21st) a sweatlodge was set up and Richard (ArchDruid of 1971), Paul and Mike did partake thrice of sweat sessions. Then the two did leave Mike to vigil under a starry sky. 9. Mike then did stay up all night. Yea, the weariness of a hard day did sore press him. Verily he spent the whole night on his feet. If he did stop for more than two minutes, he felt sleep creep into his thoughts. He did not know if he would truly make it unto morning, every hour was like a day. Every step he walked was like unto a league. 10. Richard was an hour and a half late the next morning. 11. Mike did enter into the third order, and although he grumbled a great deal, he was greatly satisfied that he had not slept! 12. The next 14 hours, though, he did sleep! Chapter the Third 1. Not long after this, Mike did initiate his trusty loyal harp, Sine Ceolbhinn (“Jean Sweetmusic”) into the third order at the island that is called Mai Fete. 2. Sine had vigiled many times and was deemed worthy of the honor bestowed upon her. Mock not the Harp! Chapter the Fourth 1. Andrea, Arch Druid of Carleton during the Years of Chaos (1990 to 1993), did vigil many times and is revered for her devo- tion... 2. On June 19th, she and Mike, clad only by the thunderous and roiling sky, performed the third order ordination using only sub- optimal reading light. 3. I say unto ye, always use white paper, large print and a flashlight in the dark! 4. Taranis bellowed his approval and all ran back to their respec- tive homes, for the Great Flood of 1993 was being unleashed. Chapter the Fifth 1. Verily it did rain for many days, until new lakes appeared through- out the arboretum. 2. During the same night as Andrea’s initiation, Sam, the Wise Ole, did vigil at the Center of the Universe, which is found just north of Skoglum field at St. Olaf. 3. He wore, as he was wont, naught but a black/blue kilt and a smile. 4. Yea!, did he not spend the night in an open field where light- ning leapt back and forth across the sky every 10 minutes until dawn?! 5. The following morning to the aforementioned night, Mike found this brave lad, still alive, wrapped in a tarp like an Irish Tamale. 6. Sam’s wits were so addled by the experience that he thought he had enjoyed it! Furthermore he had seen things that he not seen, heard things that he did not hear, felt things he had not felt, smelt things he had not smelt and tasted things he had not tasted!! 7. So did Sam enter into the 3rd order! Chapter the Sixth 1. Yea, a call did cry out from Circle Sanctuary in Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin that a great meeting of students of the Earth-Mother should meet at a Cave of Eagles near a city called Madison. 2. And the ones who did call forth was named Selena, patron saint of the RDNA, and her husband Dennis. 3. And this meeting was called “Pagan Spirit Gathering 1993,” and it was the 14th one, 10th at this site. 4. Sam, the wise, and Mike, the not-so-wise, did journey forth with a non-druid friend, Tim-of-the-car. 5. The journey was four hours and they saw many beautiful trees. 6. The site was a steep valley surrounded by trees and, Yea!, did many people who were pitched in tents did roll down the hill side in the night! Yet none were hurt! 7. The number present was over five hundred. Half of them en- joyed the covering of the sky more than that of clothing, Sam and Mike included. 8. Sam and Mike did arrange to have another 30th anniversary ritual and over a score of people did show up! 2 large bottles of the waters-of-life were passed around and drained, which may be a record amongst Reformed Druids! 9. Among the attendants was Alice, from the Years of Exploration. Also there was Tony Taylor and the Henge of Keltria, a member of the Ar nDraoicht Fein, two members of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (O.B.O.D.) and a young man named Kyle. All enjoyed the ritual with the Wisdom of Thomas the Fool being shared. 10. Kyle was so moved by the spirits that he did rush up to Mike and Sam and did ask to enter the third order. The two ArchDruids were puzzled, for Kyle was but a 1st order druid on that very day, but since Kyle was camped next to them, and had given them steak and alcohol all week, they judged him a man of good heart and soul. 11. Kyle was then raised to the second order by Mike and all there present raised the cup and drank yet more of the waters-of-life. 12. Kyle was then raised unto the third order of Dalon Ap Landu by Mike and all present did raise the cup again drink yet more of the waters-of-life, for he promised to vigil on his return home. 13. Kyle was then made ArchDruid of Naples, Florida and all present raised the cup and drank yet more waters-of-life, for Kyle prom- ised to recruit more partakers of the Water-of-Life on his return home, and to write to us often."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"406 14. Mike, Sam, and Kyle, the only three known ArchDruids in the country (although others existed without our knowledge), did pour praise upon the Earth-mother for the creation of a new Grove! Chapter the Seventh 1. Alice, the reviver, did step forward and asked to be brought into the third order of the most fertile Dalon Ap Landu. Alice having vigiled many times in the past, was deemed quite worthy. 2. Mike did read the words, and all present did partake of the Waters-of-Life yet again. 3. Mike the Fool did consider initiating Sam’s drum, Stormus, into the third order, but saw that Kyle was filled with a satiety of holiness. 4. All then did stumble back unto their tents, especially Kyle, to meditate upon the sharing of the Waters-of-Life. Praise Be! Chapter the Eighth 1. And so it came to pass that Paul, the blond, did decide that he also would vigil with the Earth-Mother. 2. And he did choose a night that did prove to have poor weather, as is common for Druids. 3. The site that Paul had choseth was the Island of Mai-Fete in the lower of Lyman’s Lakes, where Mike’s Great Dream had occurred. 4. Taranis, god of thunder, enjoys vigils. 5. Mike did long question this blond Druid and found him most knowledgeable and wise, far more than himself. 6. In the morning drizzle, in apprehension of which Mike had wisely laminated the Ordination sheets (O how wise he was!), Mike did ordain Paul the Mighty into the Third Order. 7. The two cloaked members of Dalon Ap Landu did participate in the time-honored tradition of a ritual breakfast this time at Hardee’s, of which Paul, of course, paid for, as is custom. Chapter the Ninth 1. The next who did wish to enter the Third Order that summer was Nikii Lambert, a redoubtable young wench who had decided to vigil in the most inaccessible site yet known to Druidism. 2. We called the site the Pine Forest of the Deep Lower Arbore- tum. Indeed it took 30 minutes to reach the site on foot! 3. Mike and Nikii did set up camp on the pine needles and col- lected wood for a long fire. 4. They went to the Cannon River to cool down over with a quick swim, for it was a sweltering night, and to purify themselves in the flowing waters of the Cannon. 5. After the fire was going, Nikki was left to fend for herself on that long night in the woods. 6. There were many four legged critters that did noisily poke about her camp during that night, interrupting her concentration. 7. And, lo!, she found that pine wood burns very quickly and spent most of the night trying to constantly replace the diminishing firewood stock. 8. She also lamented her lack of caffeine. 9. In the morning, Paul & Mike, joined her. She was relatively cranky, but none the worse for wear. 10. With the fire rekindled, the ceremony of consecration was per- formed by Mike, and Nikki gloriously entered the Order of Dalon ap Landu. And great was the quantity of Waters that was con- sumed by all parities! 11. Another quick swim in the Cannon was called for, but was kept short due to the persistance of the bugs known as mosquitos. 12. A long becloaked march was made to Hardees for breakfast, parading through the streets in fine cloaks. We were tired, but proud! Chapter the Tenth 1. The last Druid to enter the Third Order during that busy Sum- mer Break was Brandon Schields, one of the Druids from the late 80s. 2. His ordination occurred after he led a sweatlodge on Lughnasadh evening. Sam, Paul & I attended the sweat and found it good.. 3. After the cleansing sweat, we went to the Hill of Three Oaks, and once there, Sam did ordain his dear friend at about 8pm, because Brandon had vigiled on a previous day. It was Sam’s first ordination of another Druid into the Third Order, and he did it well. Chapter the Eleventh 1. That Fall, the Frangquists did visit Carleton and Rebecca Hrobak did vigil on the bosom of the Earth-Mother, not long before the Samhain rite of 1993 was performed. 2. Hers was almost a pleasant vigil in the Little Grove (known also as the Druid Den) not far from the Hill of Three Oaks, except for the strong chill that was in the air. She however burned but one large log during that long night. 3. Indeed she was honored that night by a visit from David & Deborah Frangquist, along with many other Druids seeking to give her company, yet most of her time was spent quietly in meditation of staring into the fire. 3. When a good 5 or 6 Third Order Druids did march up to the Hill of Three Oaks, we saw the Sun break over the horizon and marvelled at how it was framed in the branches of a large oak tree. 4. Mike did bring Rebecca into the Third Order, although there was but little Waters for the service. 5. At that time, Nikki and Mike did enter into the Fourth Order of Grannos with the blessing of Frangquist. 6. Paul did enter the Fifth Order of Braciaca under the blessing of Frangquist. 7. Mike did enter the Sixth Order of Belenos under the blessing of Frangquist. 8. Possibly the largest Druidic bonfire at Carleton was held that Samhain in honor of our guests, the Sheltons and the Frangquists. Mike barely escaped incinerating himself with the unprecedented use of gasoline. It was a grand sight! Chapter the Twelfth 1. During the next spring of 1994, two more Druids did wish to enter the Third Order; Anne and Michelle the Dark, and they wished to vigil on the same night. 2. Anne vigiled on a sandy Island and Michelle the Dark vigiled under the boughs of great spreading willow tree by the river bank. They were also given much firewood to pass the night. 3. Unlike all the previous vigils that years, theirs was very pleasant, because it did not rain and they had many friendly visitors. In fact it went so smoothly that the previous vigilers were jealous and the air was loud with their jealous comments! 4. After a fortuitous sighting of deer, we processed by Torch Light to the Hill of Three Oaks where Sam brought Anne to the Third Order. 5. Nikki brought Michelle the Dark to the Third Order, and the golden rays of the rising sun did illuminate the Druid Sigil that had been drawn on her forehead by the Waters. 6. We all did drink deeply of the Waters, so much so that we had trouble reaching The Happy Chef, so we instead took a cab there! 7. At Happy Chef, reeking of campsmoke & whiskey, we did try the Black Rasperry Liquor with our pancakes, in addition to more Waters. 8. We were also forced to take a cab back, although we were only"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"407 15 blocks from Campus! 9. This did begin the time of the Triple Archdruidcy of Carleton in which the three buxom friends (Becky, Michelle the Dark & Anne) did boldly lead the Druids in seeking the Earth-Mother at Carleton. Chapter the Thirteenth 1. In the May of 1995, a most unusual ordination took place with Heather Gruenberg. 2. After preparing herself and receiving blessed items through the mail, the ceremony was conducted over the phone, from Jane of Olaf’s room with Sam Adams providing Musical accompaniment. 3. And so, with the help of US WEST, Mike did bring Heather into the Third Order. 4. Mike and Sam felt that the ceremony was adequate but deficient in charm compared to a ritual being performed in person. 5. Later that Summer, Mike went to Royal Oak Michigan (a good place for a Druid to live) and aided Heather in vigiling, for she sleeps too easily. Chapter the Fourteenth 1. Almost a year did pass before another opportunity to enjoy the pleasures of vigiling did arrive. And this did prove to be yet another double vigil! 2. The three Archdruids of Carleton College were tired after 2 years of leading the Grove, so they were delighted when two freshlings, Michelle Hajder and Irony Sade, did ask to enter the Third Order in the May of 1996. 3. And all the Druids did rejoice at seeing these new contenders for the Third Order. 4. Irony, for well he is named, chose to vigil in the pine forest, near where Nikki had once vigiled, although he did not know of Nikki, and he chose to perform the vigil without fire and he chose to walk throughout the night, not staying in one place too long. 5. Michelle the Blond, who did enjoy tea, chose to vigil in a far more distant spot on the Cannon, verily!, it was 40 minutes from Goodhue, in a lowland of enormous trees. No Druid had ever dreamed of vigiling so far from the campus! 6. Anne, Michelle the Dark and Mike did escort them out into the Arb and we did help carry tents (for it looked as if to rain) and blankets. 7. Mike remained with Michelle the Blond, who would become his great-grandchild, and imparted the history of the Druids and explained their ways to her, although she already did know most of them instinctively, although it was only her freshman year at Carleton. 8. After bathing in the chilly waters of the Cannon (for Lo! he stinkethed), Mike did leave Michelle the Blond to meditate on her vigilling and he sought to locate the peregrinous Irony, whose own nocturnal wanderings on that vigil would lead him through- out the arb, as had Mike’s Vigil three years hence. 9. Irony did startle Mike by appearing suddenly out of the sable darkness with nary a sound, which is indeed amazing, as Mike was reknowned for travelling without sound in the woods of the Arb. 10. After Mike imparted a few words of advice to him on Druidism, for Irony was already wise in the ways of Druidism in his Fresh- man year, Mike did notice that Irony was glowing. 11. Mike had already known that Irony was “close” to the spiritual world, but Mike did not know that the spiritual world glowed through Irony in the night! 12. Mike did essay to find a hidden source of light on Irony’s per- sonage, but none could be found, and Mike took this as a good omen. 13. That night it did rain only lightly, for the Earth Mother smiled upon this vigil, and Mike did secretly camp in the tall grassy fields near the Hill of Three Oaks, for he feared the wrath of Security guards should he be discovered. 14. Later that night, Irony did startle Michelle the Blond by appear- ing suddenly out of the sable darkness with nary a sound, which was stupid, for he had to dodge a swinging cudgel, swung by a frightened Druid. 15. Irony did apologize to Michelle the Blond, for they are good friends, and they shared smores and tea over a campfire for a short while as it misted softly around them. 16. Anne and Michelle the Dark, and perhaps others, did visit the two vigiling Druids and shared their wisdom and brought more water for tea & cider mix. 17. Morning did come, as it always does (though slower on vigiling nights, so the vigilers claim), and Anne & Michelle the Dark did essay to discover where Mike had camped. They then fatiguedly processed for 40 minutes to get to the site of the two vigilers. 18. We moved stealthily so as to surprise the vigilers, and to verify that they had not fallen asleep during the night. 19. Irony was not to be found at his alloted site and the three Third Orders did lament that he could possibly be anywhere in the Arb and noted that they were too tired to look for him. 20. So they grabbed Irony’s stuff and went to find Michelle the Blond, and soon reached her site. 21. As we approached her site, we noted that Michelle the Blond was in a trance and looked through us and did not see us, al- though we were but 20 yards from her. So she wandered away into the woods while we quietly packed up her gear. 22. Eventually Michelle and Irony both returned to the vigil site and it was revealed that they were both still of the 1st order. We therefore brought them unto the 2nd Order. 23. After this the ordinations to the 3rd Order were performed by Michelle the Dark with both Michelle the Blond and Irony the Glowing being present together. It rained a little and Mike took many photographs, as he was wont. 24. Then we processed back to Goodhue, noting a fortuitous pair of deer along the way, and drove to Hardees where whiskey and syrup did flow, although the two Vigilers did weasel their way out of buying us breakfast. 25. So, in this way Michelle Hajder and Irony Sade did enter into their Archdruidcy at Carleton and begin a rather intense period of activities during the Years of Legitimacy.

At this Pagan Spirit Gathering of 1993, all the different Druids and Neo-Pagans did gather together to discuss how to pass the time, as it was the sixth of the seven day festival. 2. Tony, the Tailor, did suggest that all take their stuffed toy cows, stuffed toy animals and cow-ish shaped decorations, and they did have a cattle raiding game. The rules were such: Chapter the Second 1. Only camps with cow-colored banners are playing. 2. Guile is better than force. 3. All cows must be kept in the open, contentedly grazing before your tents. 4. Do not damage these icons for they support your very lives with their milk. 5. The quality of the raid is better than the quantity of cows. 6. Tony is the final arbiter and A-Druid-icator. 7. Blood-price is assigned by Tony on poor sports, brutes and de- stroyer of property. 8. Any who weareth a cow on their person may be taken with that cow to the camp and done with as the Druid wishes! Chapter the Third 1. That morning Sam and Mike did well by capturing 12 of the 24 icons before any guardians could stir from their tents. 2. Mike, the skillful, did climb a tree to fetch Pig-asus, the Pig, and did capture Bill the Cat, who was a most un-cow-like cow. 3. Unfortunately, Mike did overtly & loudly brag of the number of their cows and Sam, the guardian of the cows, was distracted by the charms of a well-endowed sky-clad Keltrian, whilst the many men of that tribe did swipe much of our great herd! 4. Alas! and Alack! for the guile of the Keltrians! Chapter the Fourth 1. Mike did once again increase their herd with six more cows. Unfortunate for this brave lad, he did stir up the wrath of Cow- Woman. Fear ye her wrath!! 2. Cow-Woman, weighing twenty Stone, did bellow in anger and charged upon Mike and Sam’s encampment. With her iron-strong arms she did wrestle both frightened Druids unto the ground and then branded them as chattel. Oh, the shame on these two Druids! 3. She stuffed all her cows, plus two more for interest, into her ample bosom, where no efforts could dislodge them! Mike and Sam did try to no avail! Eventually, they had to admit defeat. 4. With a loud, contemptuous snort she did stomp out of camp as Mike and Sam wept for their lost cows! But, Sam pointed out that other cows were in need of our loving care! Chapter the Fifth 1. One such raid was the raid on the Keltrian camp where eight cows did graze, guarded only by five Druids. 2. Mike and Sam did skillfully creepeth forth using Winnebagos to obscure their progress towards that mighty rival Druid en- campment. 3. Waving high above it was a great eight-foot cow-flag that all other desired to possess. 4. With silent guile, they swept upon the cows, scattering the herd into a wide stampede 5. One Druid, named Kyleen, did grab Mike and did sorely wrestle him down to the Earth before wresting the cow from Mike’s grasp. 6. Mike and Sam did dodge and swerve until they escaped with two more cows! MOO!!! 7. They sang as they ran back to their camp: How many cows have you now? No Cows! No Cows! How many cows have we now? Six cows! Six Cows! 8. For verily they had six cows, though two of them were rather feline in form and so did not produce very good milk. 9. These two druids did feast richly of milk and cheese, as was their right of proud herd owners! Chapter the Sixth 1. Mike and Sam did make other daring raids, at the cost of many bruises and scratches and showed their bravery and Guile. 2. Mike and Sam did then return to Northfield, with Tim-of-the- Car, with many new connections and friendships with other groups. Ones that they will share with their fellow Druids. 3. So ends the Book of Cattle Raids. Moo."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"409 The Book of the Great Dream by Mike the Fool Introduction 1. I add the account of this dream because it explains a lot of my devotion to the RDNA. 2. Other dreams, by others, are no less valid a source of inspira- tion. Dreams deal with things that our waking minds cannot. Chapter the First 1. I decided that I would lead the Beltane of 1992, since no one else seemed inclined. For truly, many Beltane rituals have bombed in the past. 2. The Beltane of 1990 collapsed because a strange man showed up and threw blood on the altar stone of the Hill of Oaks while Heather was reinscribing the Druid Sigil. 3. This was my first ritual that I had led and it was held on Mai Fete Island, not long after the slime-o-rama in the algae on the previous day. 4. It was done skyclad with Alex the hairy, Heather the Fair, and Sam the wise. We were to make a circuit of the lower Lyman lake. We assumed bird shapes for the first third, wolf-shapes for the second third and horse shapes for the third. Then, lastly, we did assume fish shape and swam to the island in the chilly wa- ters. 5. Then all did bed down by a ROARING hot fire, in a large snuggle of wool blankets under a starry sky. All did dream strange things, and here is mine which I remembered. Chapter the Second 1. It was a dark and stormy night in which there was no color but shades of grey. It was a desolate, mountainous road that I was traveling. 2. This road reminded me of the highlands, nothing scenic, just road. So narrow was this road, that I had to press up against the cliff face to avoid oncoming cars which sought to hit me. 3. I traveled many miles in the hard rain and lightning. My soul felt great pain and pity for itself. I stopped at a bus-shelter. 4. A tourist bus did pull up, and then did pour forth its passen- gers. They were the members of the class of ’94 and ’95, people of the past who I didn’t know and faces of people I had not met yet. 5. When the people got onboard, I asked if I could join them, for my journey was long, and my feet were tired. Miraculously there was only one space open, and they were expecting me. 6. We traveled long and came to another pit-stop. When I got out, they drove off without me. This upset me, but I continued to travel onwards until I reached the top of the hill. Then I slid down the other side for a mile. 7. I finally slid under a parked truck and banged my head merci- lessly on the universal joint. I crawled out and saw a youth hos- tel. A warm YELLOW light did come from the windows. 8. I entered and there were all the people from the bus playing cards and running about doing things. I asked if there was a bed I could sleep on. Miraculously they were expecting me, since a late cancellation had made an opening! 9. Then did a man walk up to me. His body was covered with red, stiff hog bristles (in a black and white background) with a bald head and piercing blue eyes. He reminded me of a Druid, Donny, I had met on the Isle of Arann of Scotland the previous year. 10. This man did shake my hand, in a secret way, much like a mason’s handshake and said to me. “Welcome to the club, Michael. You are one of us, now!” He smiled. Chapter the Third 1. I awoke with a start and then snuggled into the blankets think- ing upon this vision until the sun came up and we all chanted 2. He is the sun god! He is the one god! Ra! Ra! Ra! Ra! Ra! 3. I did take this dream as an initiation into a Druid priesthood. 4. Powerful are the spirits on this campus! There are many fairy mounds, stone circles, groves, rivers, diversity of plants and ani- mals. It is a good place to do vigils or seek the spirits."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"410 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB The Book of Stones Chapter the First 1. Dark and stormy was the night that I pensively strode forth on my last exploration in the arboretum, for I was preparing to go to the land of the rising sun. 2. I did not know the future of Druidism at Carleton, for the pre- sumptive Archdruids did cry of thier unpreparedness, as often they do. 3. I went to the circle of stones near the Hill of Three Oaks, “the Dancing Sisters” as David Frangquist had named them so many years ago, and asked them, “O mighty stones, bones of the earth, heareth now my plea, we who are thy siblings. How farest Druid- ism in the future?” 4. Long were the stones quiet, as is their wont. 5. And I waited. 6. Lo, they did not speak, so I did prepare to leave, when they quickly spoke up, and this did they say, “The sea refuses no river. The stone that lieth not in thy way, need not offend thee. Fire is a good servant, but a bad master.” 7. And with that they did become quiescent. 8. And I understood message of “The Twelve.” Chapter the Second 1. Many are mysteries found in the alignments of the rocks at Carleton. 2. It is said that under the altar stone on the Hill of Three Oaks is an original copy of Frangquist’s Druid Chronicles, but this is false. 3. The Class of 1886 rock outside of the Library is said to have broken in two when the last member of that class died. 4. The obelisk on Monument Hill has a fourth side which is blank and it is said that this side describes the mysteries of Druidism. It is due south of the Hill of Three Oaks. 5. There is a second rock on the Hill of Three Oaks and the altar stone line up with rising and setting sun of Beltane and Samhain. It is said that on both days the sun doth rise behind the crown of an old oak tree in the east and doth plunge at sunset into the brick tower of Carleton’s steam plant. 6. “The Twelve” are in line with the Hill of Three Oaks and the Skinner Memorial chapel. It is uncertain what this means. 7. Bracing the sides at the top of the hill path to the Little Grove are two stones known as “King Arthur’s Seat” and “Fair Eleanor’s Seat” on the north and south respectively. Whosoever sleeps on them all night will be filled with poetry or madness in the morn- ing. 8. Near the lower-arb’s tennis courts, on the banks of the mighty Cannon River, are 4 sets of obelisks that once connected Lost Island to both sides of the Cannon, by a bridge that is now gone. It is said that at midnight on midsummer’s day, a bridge of light stretches between the obelisks, and whosoever crosses this bridge will be transported to a land of faery. 9. It is rumored that sleeping beneath the arch of the Hadzi sculp- ture throughout the night will result in a visit by a powerful guardian spirit. The Book of Fire by Mike the Fool and Andrea the Fair Chapter the First 1. How to build a fire, sounds simple? It is. Certain conventions have arisen over the years pertaining to fire collection. 2. The Earth-Mother did choose well in putting her Druids on this campus, for wood abounds for the use in Fire, but you must choose that wood wisely. 3. Sometimes fires are not very important. Chapter the Second 1. Though shalt use only dead wood. Live plants have psychic abili- ties and scream in fear when you yank or break their limbs. Do you want bad vibes in your ritual fire? 2. Matches and lighters are permissible. 3. Use of Druid juice, although discouraged, is necessary to en- courage wet wood. 4. Always collect a little more kindling that you’ll need. You’ll need it. 5. Four armloads will do a simple ritual fire. Chapter the Third 1. Sweatlodges are a powerful spiritual tool for Druidic rituals. Do not use them merely for pleasure. 2. Many Native Americans and Native European cultures used Sweatlodges to purify the body of poisons and negative energy. The mind often travels well in the Dark when all that heat and magic start flying around. 3. Drugs and Alcohol are big NO-NOs, because they are danger- ous with sweatlodges and should not be used before hand. 4. Drink A LOT of water and salt during the day of the sweat. Chapter the Fourth 1. Sweats are done nude and not for perverted reasons. Many mystics claim that magic energy dissipates from the body through the palms and soles, the forehead, the belly, the armpits, the nipples and the genital organs. For the most powerful sweatlodge, it must be done in the nude, and you should warn all comers, before they come, of this fact. 2. Because of the nudity, choose a secluded spot at night where wanderers are unlikely to pass by. A guardian/fire tender is rec- ommended. Little Grove and Oak Grove are Good. Chapter the Fifth 1. I will tell you how to make a sweatlodge, if no one knows at the time of this reading. 2. Dig a foot deep hole, about one foot wide where the ground is comfortable to sit upon. 3. You build a “igloo” of bent poles, tied down into a dome about three feet high and six feet wide, around that hole in the ground. You cover the dome with plastic tarps to hold in the steam va-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"411 pors. You cover the tarps with blankets to keep in the heat, so that the steam lasts longer. 4. You gather ten or more fist sized rocks. Volcanic rocks are better and they will not ‘Explode’ when water is poured on them. Most of these ‘explosions’ are the formation of cracks, but the Sound of that happening is frightening. 5. You gather at least ten armloads of dry, deadwood, with possi- bly a charcoal base for the fire. You build the fire and insert the rocks into the fire. When they are glowing hot, you transport them into the foot deep hole you dug. Frying pans and thick leather gloves help at this point. Keep the fire going, with possi- bly a second round of rocks heating up while you sweat. 6. Strip down and purify yourselves. Then you prepare for medita- tion and enter the sweatlodge. You can do some mantras, chants and prayers until you, or the rocks, are finished. Then exit and drink some water. Chapter the Sixth 1. Always practice safe fire rules. 2. Use a fire-ring with little surrounding underbrush. 3. Extinguish the fire to the point where you’d be willing to hold all the logs between your legs for a minute. 4. Beware of windy days. Chapter the Seventh 1. Beware of glass at ritual sites, the best thing to do to prevent build up of glass is for someone to pass the ritual sites after ‘party’ times of the year and pick up any WHOLE bottles. 2. If whole bottles stay out more than a day, they will become broken bottles. 3. Magnets will pick up nails really well. 4. Encourage shoes to be worn when a site hasn’t been groomed. Chapter the Eighth 1. I tell you that it is far better that the Druids use wood than for it to be chopped into mulch by grounds crew. 2. If you do spot areas of the Arb, where trees have been cut down and stacked into neat piles of log, I tell you that you should abscond with those logs to a hidden spot and store them for future ritual usage. 3. Any bad karma can be dealt with later. Do not delay, for they will return to collect the wood. Chapter the Ninth 1. You may ask who made the two sweatlodges used from 1992- 1995? 2. The first was made by Michael and Matt (the tall) on Mai Fete in the Summer of 1992. 3. The wood for that came from saplings cut down by grounds crew when they cleared the woods next to Lower Lyman lake. 4. The second, of the lower arboretum, was made by Paul the Blond and Michael in the summer of 1993. 5. The wood for that came from saplings cut down by grounds crew when they cleared the woods next to the Oak Opening of the lower arboretum. 6. It should be noted, that there is a rival tradition at Carleton for demolishing the sweatlodge after every usage rather than re-using it. Chapter the Tenth 1. At campfires, it is always nice to have some type of food that can be cooked after the ritual. 2. Smores, hotdogs, marshmallows and tea pots are the favorite things to heat. 3. Coals cook better than flames. Chapter the Eleventh 1. Another fun fire activity is making Candles and Torches for Druidical purposes. 2. Both generally require paraffin wax which is cheap, although Beeswax is always preferable in quality. 3. To heat wax, use a double boiler system by filling a pot with water and putting the can holding the wax inside the water. This prevents the wax from surpassing a boiling point, which could produce a cloud of combustible wax vapors! 4. Candles can be made by filling Dixie cups or halved coke cans with wax and suspending a thread in the hardening mixture. Candles can also be repeatedly dipped into the wax, but this will a great deal of time. 5. To make fine torches, you need to gather stalk of dried mullein rods from the fields. They look like crusty corndogs on hollow woody stems between three and seven feet high. 6. One can dip torches gradually or you can take semi-congealed wax in your hands and just squish it onto the torch. 7. Be careful not to put too much wax on a torch that it will cause the stem to snap! 8. A torch made in this way will burn for 10 to forty minutes and is difficult to extinguish by wind or nearby movement. Chapter the Twelfth 1. It is considered good luck to leap over the Druid campfire. But do so carefully. 2. So ends the Book of Fire."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"412 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB THE DEAD BAY SCROLLS or The Apocryphal of Miracles by the New Reformed Druids of North America of the Hazelnut Mother Grove South Bay Branch Original Introduction: In all the hoop-lah over the Discovery of the Dead Bay Scrolls, I think it’s time to set forward the truth of the matter. For those who accuse me of unconscionable delay in taking two years to publish them, I can only remind them that it is taking over 45 years for the Dead Sea Scrolls to be published. Despite the well-published claims with amply valid evidence, the Dead Bay Scrolls were not written in ancient Icelandic. The often- cited passages of Das Edda Todvordgeshritten is not from transla- tion, but merely bad English. End of debate. As for the location of the discovery of the documents, I can only state that they were discovered in 1993 at an undisclosed Trailer park in the Bay Region of San Francisco. The Dead Bay Scrolls were then mailed to Carleton College by an undisclosed source. There they were rediscovered in a small mailbox at Carleton by a Nomadic Postal worker who gave them to Michael Scharding. Once there, the original of the DBS were carefully photographed by an Epson Scan- ner and placed on magnetic media. In order to protect the scholars’ rights to publication, Michael Scharding reserved the editor’s right to the limited first publication in 1993. However, due to pressing demand for copies by the public, Michael has relented and given free access to the DBS to the general public. Controversy has raged over the contents. Do they contain infor- mation that would undermine the assumed beliefs of the Reformed Druids? Do they tell of disunity with the group before the great Druid Diaspora and the Destruction of the Berkeley Grove? I’ll not answer these questions yet, as many more years of study are required by scholarly panels. However for the first time, they are now available to the public. Enjoy. —Michael Scharding, Editor Computer Math Center Dec. 9th, 1993 c.e. 40th Day of Geamradh Year XXXI of the Reform New Introduction I wrote the original introduction after intensive study of the Dead Sea Scrolls for a school project, and was sick of all the bickering that I saw there. Basically, when I wrote the Dead Lake Scrolls in August of 1993, I sent copies to the various existing groves at the time. The Hazelnut Grove was so enamored with them, that they set about writing their own materials to honor the thirtieth anniversary of Re- formed Druidism, which had occurred on April 1993. This is the one of the few NRDNA documents that have been produced without Isaac’s influence, and they can therefore give a broader understanding of the NRDNA. Most of the Druids of the Hazelnut Grove were old-time Druids, from the 70s, so here they give voice to their ideas of how Druidism stands in California today.

Between the last ritual of the Hazelnut Mother Grove in the land of the East Bay—the Death March, and the first meeting of the Hazelnut Mother Grove South Bay Branch (Gee, look at all those puns!), which occurred at the first harvest time of Lughnasadh, there passed several years when Republicans held high office, and nothing was occurring with the Druids of Cali- fornia. 2. Unless things were happening in other parts of the state with other Druids of the Reform, who did not communicate with the Mother Grove. 3. These were called by the Arch-Druid the Boring Times, not to be confused with the Burning Times. Chapter the Second 1. In that same place where lurked the Orks and the AK-47’s there also lurked a young man for a few moons who was a student in Wicca of she who was to become the Co-Arch Druid. 2. This young man had just got out of the Army and was a bit naive. 3. He believed, or so did he tell the Co-ArchDruid, that the ArchDruid was not just playing computer games to play com- puter games. He was playing them to do important ritual Magick that would either save the world as we know it or change reality so that we would like it better. 4. And the Co-ArchDruid pondered this and wondered at its mean- ing. Chapter the Third 1. And the ArchDruid dwelt during most of the Boring Times in the land of Orks and AK-47s—and he was sore displeased. 2. For the quake came and trashed his space, and buried him un- der a torrent of his books. 3. He crawled out and rent his hair saying “No more! I have had enough!” 4. He had an asthma attack and moved to the South Bay. 5. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Fourth 1. And he then told the Co-ArchDruid that what he was doing with the games was a form of catharsis called kill therapy in which the monsters became fundies and all the other creatures the ArchDruid Stephen would rid the world of. 2. And she came to participate. 3. And he still does so to this day. Chapter the Fifth 1. And the ArchDruid moved four times during the Boring Times until he came to rest in the Alamo, and then moved one more time to where he dwells today. 2. Always during the Active Times and the Boring Times did he promote musical groups and New Age Fairs by distributing their cards and flyers at many locations in the East and South Bay. 3. While promoting the shows, one of which he himself co-pro- duced, he would collect and tell jokes about he-who-was-then- vice-president, Quayle, who was at that time a figure of fun for many (and horror for more). 4. And he collected until he had 365 of them. Chapter the Sixth 1. After the end of the Boring times, he participated in the Laun- dry Think Tanks, at which the officers of the Grove planned the next meeting of the grove, and in what other activities the Grove would participate. 2. At the most recent non-boring ritual, Lughnasadh, even Mr. Boring showed an unboring part of himself by participating fully, which shocked the Arch Druid into having an asthma attack (two days later). 3.

BORING (AKA EARACHE ALIEN MESS) Chapter the First 1. In the city of San Jose there dwelt a man called Earache Alien Mess. 2. He was co-producer with the ArchDruid Stephen of the New Age Renaissance Fair, which was not boring. 3. But the Mess prided himself in not thinking and in being bor- ing. 4. The Mess played organ and volleyball, did astrology and had a radio show at the local cooperative radio station. 5. It was called the Eric Mystic show, which Stephen did rename the Earache Mistake Show. It consisted of New Age music and topics with people calling in. 6. Once he and Stephen were subbing for a woman who was then ill. Hers was not a call in show, but Earache told people to call in. It was a show on Celtic Magick and Druidism. 7. People were so bored when they heard his voice they stopped calling in. 8. Stephen then took the mike, and in his Edward R. Murrow voice said, “Earache Mess, the voice that silences communica- tion.” 9. People called in after that. Chapter the Second 1. But in time even Mr. Boring became bored with being boring and not thinking. 2. And so he studied how to be less boring. He also engaged in a very dangerous activity—thinking. 3. And so it was that in the fullness of time his face actually cracked into a smile, and he laughed at times, and no damage was done. 4. But he still had a problem. And it was dealing with women. He did not even try, thinking it not worth the trouble. 5. But women, especially Druidesses, and pagan women are pow- erful, and he missed much by being sexist. THE BOOK OF GAMES Chapter the First 1. But still within the Boring times in that same place where lurked the Orks and the AK-47’s there also lurked a young man who was a student in Wicca of she who was to, become the Co- ArchDruid. 2. This young man had just got-out of the army and was a bit naive. 3. He believed, or so did he tell the Co-ArchDruid that the ArchDruid was not just playing computer games to play com- puter games.

And the Co-ArchDruid pondered this and wondered at its mean- ing. Chapter the Second 1. Meanwhile the ArchDruid played the computer games, and added more games whenever the Earth Mother did spread Her largesse in his direction. 2. And so also did he put money by to add to his collection of computers on which to play games and so either save the world or to change reality as we know it. 3. And the ArchDruid moved away from the land of Orcs and AK- 47’s many times until at length he came to dwell in a place called the Alamo which was in San Jose. 4. And he was the only dweller in that place beside the concierge who spoke English. All the others spoke Spanish. 5. And so the Co-ArchDruid spoke to them when she came to visit the Arch-Druid for what she called Kill Therapy. 6. She expiated her anger by killing things on the computer."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"415 THE BOOK OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY Chapter the First 1. And the Druids had now come to their 30th year, and wanted to celebrate and thank the deities for helping them to thrive for 30 years. 2. But there also was a death of an author held high among the People for his wisdom. And many were the books of his writing held and cherished among the people, especially the Co- Archdruids. 3. And the Arch-Druid wanted to honor him now, not wait for Samhain. And so was there a memorial as well as great joy for the 30 years of the Reform. Chapter the Second 1. And the Co-Arch-Druid was in a state of delight for the Arch- Druid Terlach who had ordained her into the 2nd and into the 3rd also was in attendance. 2. And he was Preceptor, and honored an ancient , hoary tradition of the first Preceptor (Cherniack). 3. And when the Co-Arch-Druid asked him if the Earth-Mother had given forth of Her bounty, he answered “Yup!” 4. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Third 1. And the Arch-Druid, whom she had herself laid the apostolic hand of 3rd Ordination upon after he waited over 8 years after his 2nd, was there and took part in the procession and other parts of the ritual, and was congratulated by the older ArchDruids. 2. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Fourth 1. But there was also in that place great puzzlement, for they won- dered that she would ordain when others had refused to, for in many minds and many quarters he was seen as a jerk. 2. And she answered onto them saying, “He did the work. He endured the ordeal. He has studied much in many traditions, but especially the sage Kon Fu Tse, who has wrought many changes within him.” 3. For he is a magician. And it is the task of a magician to produce changes in reality in accordance with his will. And he is also a priest. 4, And so did the Co-Arch-Druid anoint him just before the close of the year. Even just before the holy day of Samhain, for she was a sadist. Chapter the Fifth 1. He had committed to doing a Samhain druid ritual for the OTO’ers, thinking he could get her to perform it. 2. But it was in her mind to ordain him and have that be his first ritual as an Arch-Druid. And he called his Grove Tuatha De Danaan. 3. And many were the members from Hazelnut Mother Grove South Bay Branch (Gee, look at all those puns!) who attended the ritual and saw that it was well done. 4. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Sixth 1. And great was the Co-Arch-Druid’s pride at seeing this, so that several buttons broke, for she saw that she had ordained well. 2. For it is the way of a true priest to rise above their personal imperfections, act their station and to lead the people in the ritual, and the one called Sommer did that well. 3. And it was the first ritual to be done in the East Bay for several years, and since the Hazelnut had moved, and its name had grown by many characters, it was the first grove in the East Bay to be holding regular rituals. 4. And there was great rejoicing"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"416 THE BOOK OF THE LAUNDRY-THINK-TANK Chapter the First 1. And it came to pass that the Co-Arch-Druid preferred to do her laundry the slow cheap way at her own washer and dryer, rather than at any Laundromat. 2. But the washer and dryer were at her former residence, the house of her mother-in law. 3. And this was also the dwelling of, the Arch-Druid of the Hazel- nut Mother Grove South Bay Branch (Gee, look at all those puns!). 4. And so during the time of agitation, the rinse, and the house shaking spin. (5.4 on the Richter scale) The Co-Arch-Druids discussed the matters that mattered to them. So was born the grand tradition of the Laundry Think Tank. 5. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Second 1. They did reason together, and-occasionally rhymed, and even burst into song, which the others in attendance did try to ignore. 2. They planned the next ritual to be held at which the Arch-Druid always had a guided meditation. 3. And the Co-Arch-Druid included it in her script, and there was great rejoicing. 4. But the Arch-Druid, who was fond of shamanism, hated scripts) and made up a poem: 5. If you must have scripts, Study them here ’Cause once at the site, Scripts disappear. 6. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Third 1. And at first only third orders did participate. 2. But behold!, two there were who were only firsts, though one had a high degree in Ar nDriaocht Fein, the Other Druids, and was exceedingly wise in the their ways. 3. So the Co-Arch-Druids said they were invited, because of their wisdom, for they were women. And like the Co-Arch Druid they were Wiccans. 4. And they joined the Think-Tank. 5. For their wisdom was discovered in a Tarot Reading. 6. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Fourth 1. There came one into the Laundry Think Tank also who was large and made good food. 2. Now this one had been named after the Good God, Dagda in a special naming ceremony at Ancient Ways, a gathering of the folk. 3. The ritual came after a 3rd Order Ordination of Don the Blonde also called Butt Boy. 4. And the Arch-Druids did greatly love to give all the people names by which they would be known. The Co-arch-Druid named one woman named Sonya who had blonde hair Paper Moon so that she was Sonya Paper Moon. 5. Now this ritual of ordination and naming was the first Druidic event at Ancient Ways in five years, so it will live in the memory of many. At least eight and thirty. 6. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Sixth 1. For Don the Blond had survived the endless night’s vigil with- out so much as a fire. 2. And he would create the Angus Og Grove of Alameda and Contra Costa counties and thereby create a new kind of Druid, the Ombanda Druids of North America. 3. But it is not known if this had indeed come to pass. And the Arch Druid had doubts. Chapter the Seventh 1. Also was there discussion of matters of great philosophical weight, such as opening the other orders to others who had interest, not by rank, for the Arch-Druid was not one to love hierarchy, but merit. 2. So each order would have its own color ribbon and a tutelary deity appropriate to its nature. 3. Green was known to all as healing and herbs and called Dian Cecht after the God of Healing. 4. Blue also for Bard, Taliesin, Cerrydwen and Brigid. 5. Grannos for brewing. 6. Martial Red for warriors 7. Purple for Magick and Myrrdin. 8. Silver for Women’s Mysteries—Arianrhod. 9. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Seventh 1. But not always was the discussion among the Druids of such great philosophical weight. 2. Many times did they play games on the great electronic philosopher’s machine, and kill things which were imaged elec- tronically, for in the Arch-Druid’s (strange) mind were these ac- tivities linked ritually. 3. Also was there a game of the role-playing, and the Co-Arch- Druid got to play the parts of the non-player characters, and monsters, and growl and wroth greatly with delight. 4.

And as the great wheel of the year turned the Grove came to its favored place to celebrate a ritual for Samhain. 2. And when the Co-ArchDruid offered the sacrifice the winds were silent for it was the coming of the time of Sleep for the Earth Mother. 3. But the Grove had new spears to consecrate and three new Dru- ids were sealed to the First Order. 4. One of the bearers of these spears was a new First Order named Crazy Bear. 5. And he did the greeting of the quarters according to the Native American medicine way. 6. The ArchDruid called up the quarters in the familiar Celtic tra- dition. 7. And there was great rejoicing. Chapter the Second 1. And the officers of the Grove, the ArchDruid, the Co-ArchDruid, the Cocoa-ArchDruid, and the Preceptor told the People of the Grove what Samhain meant to them, and each person in atten- dance put the name of the honored dead into the circle. 2. But there were in that same place boys racing through on bi- cycles, for it was a public park. 3. And so they had a right as well as the Druids to be in that place. But the boys showed themselves to be Anti-Druids, for they heck- led and called out rude comments, which the ArchDruid and Crazy Bear were unable to ignore. 4. And so Crazy bear ran towards them brandishing the spear. 5. And the Anti-Druid boys rode home and told their parents, and the parents called the police, who came and interrupted the ritual. 6. But the Co-ArchDruid was able to give the Grove the blessing, which was traditional. Chapter the Third 1. And the people pondered what they had seen and were of sev- eral minds (at least one more opinion than there were those present, as is traditional). 2. And the ArchDruid was greatly irked and prophesied dire things for the Grove as a part of this. 3. He thought it was the Brit Bitch or the followers of Bush & Wilson, and the religious right on the warpath to wipe out pagankind. But the Co-ArchDruid took it as a sign of the Dru- ids’ innate strength. 4. For it was not until they showed their strength that the Anti- Druids acted against them, for they were not worthy of notice before. But flex a little muscle and the Anti-Druids suddenly sit up and take notice. 5. The Druids and pagankind in general will just have to work a little harder, and fight a little harder from now on. 6.

It’s merely an exercise in comparative religious readings on my part, for Jediism is very much a philosophy, if not a religion. Many of the materials herein are copyrighted, not that that slowed me down in choosing to include them. I hope that anyone obtaining a copy of this publication will show at least some respect to those copyright owners by not charging a profit when distributing these works to another person. By no means are any of the documents here in contained to be considered “secret” or “oathbound” by our members. Nor does this book express the opinion of anyone but its author. Feel free to show them to anyone you will. The RDNA, especially Carleton, has never officially called itself a Neo-pagan religion. However, many of it’s members may feel them- selves to be a neo-pagan. Some prefer to look upon it as merely a philosophical union that deals with religion. Both of these are good. However, we can learn from all the spiritual masters of most (if not all) religions that have appeared on this world. Take the opportunity to peruse and cogitate on what you find inside. Only one of the greatest complements you can give to the RDNA is to publish a little work of your own to help others looking for the ways. Also try to practice what you preach.

This work came about through my readings of “Bantu Philosophy” (LOC # GN.T4513 C3) by Rev. Placide Tempels, a Jesuit Priest of the early 20th century ( translated from the French ). The Bantus called the spiritual and divine entity(s) “The Force.” Correlations began to develop with further readings, but by no means is Lucasian Theol- ogy identical to Bantu Theology. For those unfamiliar with Africa, the Bantus are the people of Zaire ( AKA the Congo ) and Angola. Most are pagan in the sense that they do not call Christ their personal savior. They may have been drastic changes in their beliefs since the early 1950s when this was published. We start with some readings from the book. I apologize for the sexist use of “he” referred to in the book, as it was written in the 50s. —Michael What is “Force”? pg. 52 What is “Force”? pg. 52 What is “Force”? pg. 52 What is “Force”? pg. 52 What is “Force”? pg. 52 I believe that we should most faithfully render the Bantu thought in European language by saying that Bantu speak, act, live as if, for them, beings were forces. Force is not for them an adventitious, accidental reality. Force is even more than a necessary attribute of beings : Force is the nature of being, force is being, being is force When we think in terms of the concept “being,” they use the concept “force.” Where we see concrete beings, they see concrete forces. When we say that “beings” are differentiated by their essence or nature, Bantu say that “forces” differ in their essence or nature. They hold that there is the divine force, celestial or terrestrial forces, human forces, animal forces, vegetable and even material or mineral forces. The reader will be able to form his own opinion at the end of this study as to the validity, the exact worth of this hypothesis : in contra- distinction to our definition of being as “that which is,” or “the thing insofar as it is,” the Bantu definition reads, “that which is force,” or “the thing insofar as it is force,” or “an existent force.” We must insist once again that “force” is not for Bantu a necessary, irreducible attribute of being : no, the notion “force” takes for them the place of the notion “being” in our philosophy. Just as we have, so have they a transcendental, elemental, simple concept with them “force,” with us “being.” It is because all being is force and exists only in that it is force, that the category “force” includes of necessity all “beings.” God, men living and departed, animals, plants, and minerals. Since being is force, all these beings appear to the Bantu as forces. This universal concept is hardly used by the Bantu, but they are susceptible to philo- sophical abstractions though they express them in concrete terms only. They give a name to each thing, but the inner life of these things presents itself to their minds as such specific forces and not at all as static reality’. Energy and Life Force pg. 47 Energy and Life Force pg. 47 Energy and Life Force pg. 47 Energy and Life Force pg. 47 Energy and Life Force pg. 47 The spirits of the first ancestors, highly exalted in the superhu- man world. possess extraordinary force inasmuch as they are the founders of the human race and propagators of the divine inherit- ance of vital human strength. The other dead are esteemed only to the extent to which they increase and perpetuate their vital force in their progeny. In the minds of Bantu, all beings in the universe possess vital force of their own: human, animal, vegetable, or inanimate. Each being has been endowed by God with a certain force, capable of strengthening the vital energy of the strongest being of all creation: man. Supreme happiness, the only kind of blessing, is, to the Bantu, to possess the greatest vital force: the worst misfortune and, in very truth, the only misfortune is, he thinks, the diminution of this power. Every illness, wound or disappointment, all suffering, depression, or fatigue, every injustice and every failure; all these are held to be, and are spoken of by the Bantu as, a diminution of vital force. Illness and death do not have their source in our own vital power, but result from some external agent who weakens us through his greater force. It is only by fortifying our vital energy, through the use of magical recipes, that we acquire resistance to malevolent external forces. We need not be surprised that the Bantu allude to this vital force in their greetings one to another, using such forms of address as: “ You are strong ,” or “ You have life in you ,” “ you have life strongly in you ” {or “ The Force is with you ”—Editor} and that they express sym- pathy in such phrases as “ Your vital force is lowered ,” “ your vital en- ergy has been sapped .” A similar idea is found in the form of sympa- thy, “ wafwa ko ! ” which we translate “ you are dying ;” and by reason of our mistranslation. we are quite unable to understand the Bantu and find them given to ridiculous exaggeration when they continually say"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"419 that they are “dead” of hunger or of fatigue, or that the least obstacle or illness is “killing” them. In their own minds, they are simply indicating a diminution of vital force, in which sense their expression is reasonable and sen- sible enough. In their languages, too, are words like “ kufwa ” and “ fukwididila ,” indicating the progressing stages of loss of force, of vitality, and the superlative of which signifies total paralysis of the power to live. It is quite erroneous for us to translate these words by “to die” and “to die entirely.” The General Laws of Vital Causality. The General Laws of Vital Causality. The General Laws of Vital Causality.

(pg. 67) (pg. 67) (pg. 67) (pg. 67) (pg. 67) After what we have said upon the question of “force-beings” grouped in respect of their natures, of intensity of life class by class, and of the precedence according to primogeniture, it will be now clear that, among clan peoples, the universe of forces that are organi- cally constructed in what we can call an ontological hierarchy. The interaction of forces and the exercise of vital influence occurs, in fact, according to determined laws. The Bantu universe is not a chaotic tangle of unordered forces blindly struggling with one another. Nor must we believe that this theory of forces is the incoherent product of a savage imagination, or that the action of the same force can be now propitious and now pernicious, without a determining power to jus- tify the fact. Doubtless there are force influences acting in this un- foreseeable manner, but this assertion does not allow the conclusion that action occurs in a manner scientifically unpredictable, in a to- tally irrational mode. When a motorcar breaks down, one can say that this event was not determined in advance by what constitutes the essential nature of a motor-car, but we do not on that account believe ourselves obliged to deny the correctness and validity of the laws of mechanics. On the contrary, the breakdown itself can be explained only by adequate application of these very laws. The same is true of the laws of the interaction of forces. There are possible and necessary actions, other influences which are metaphysically impos- sible by reason of the nature of the forces in question. The possible causal factors in life can be formulated in certain metaphysical, uni- versal, immutable and stable laws. These laws can, I think, be set out as follows: RULE I RULE I RULE I RULE I RULE I. Man (living or deceased) can directly reinforce or dimin- ish the being of another man. RULE II RULE II RULE II RULE II RULE II. The vital human force can directly influence inferior force- beings (animal, vegetable, or mineral) in their being itself. RULE III RULE III RULE III RULE III RULE III. A rational being (spirit, manes, or being) can act indi- rectly upon another rational being by communicating his vital influ- ence to an inferior force (animal, vegetable, or mineral) through the intermediary of which it influences the rational being. This influence will also have the character of a necessarily effective action, save only when the object is inherently the stronger force, or is reinforced b the influence of some third party, or preserves himself by recourse to inferior forces exceeding those which his enemy is employing. Note: Note: Note: Note: Note: Certain authors claim that inanimate beings, stones, rocks, or plants and trees are called by the Bantu “bwanga” as exercising their vital influence on all that comes near the. If this were authenti- cated, it would open the question: “do lower forces act by themselves upon higher forces?” Some authors say that they do. For my part, I have never met any African who would accept this hypothesis. A priori, such an occurrence would seem to me to contradict the gen- eral principles of the theory of forces. In Bantu metaphysic the lower force is excluded form exercising by its own initiative any vital action upon a higher force. Besides, in giving their examples, these authors ought to recognize that often a living influence has been at work, for example, that of the manes. Likewise, certain natural phenomena, rocks, waterfalls, big trees, can be considered -and are considered by the Bantu- as manifestations of divine power; they can also be the sign, the manifestation, the habitat of a spirit. It seems to me that such should be the explanation of the apparent influences of lower forces on the higher force of man. Those lower being do not exercise their influence of themselves, but through the vital energy of a higher force acting as cause. Such an explanation accords in all cases with Bantu metaphysic. Such manifestations belong to the third law enun- ciated above. Loneliness, pg. 103 Loneliness, pg. 103 Loneliness, pg. 103 Loneliness, pg. 103 Loneliness, pg. 103 Just as Bantu ontology is opposed to the European concept of individuated things, existing in themselves, isolated from others, So Bantu psychology cannot conceive of man as an individual, as a force existing by itself and apart from its ontological relationships with other living be-ings and from its connection with animals or inanimate forces around it. The Bantu cannot be a lone being. It is not a good enough syn- onym for that to say that he is a social being. No; he feels and knows himself to be a vital force, at this very time to be in intimate-and personal relationship with other forces., acting above him and below him in the hierarchy of forces. He knows himself to be a vital force, even now influencing some forces, and being influenced, by others. Ancestors, pg. 64 Ancestors, pg. 64 Ancestors, pg. 64 Ancestors, pg. 64 Ancestors, pg. 64 The Created Universe is centered on man. The present human generation living on earth is the center of all humanity, including the world of the dead. The Jews had no precise views of the beyond, nothing more than that of compensation in the future life for earthly merit. The idea of bliss became known to them a short time only before the coming of Christ. “ Sheol ” was a desolate region; and sojourn there seemed a gloomy business, offering little enough to attract those who had the good fortune to be still living on earth. In the minds of the Bantu, the dead also live; but theirs is a dimin- ished life, with reduced vital energy. This seems to be the conception of the Bantu when they speak of the dead in general, superficially and in regard to the external things of life. When they consider the inner reality of being, they admit that deceased ancestors have not lost their superior reinforcing influence; and that the dead in general have acquired a greater knowledge of life and of vital or natural force. Such deeper knowledge as they have in fact been able to learn con- cerning vital and natural forces they use only to strengthen the life of man on Earth. The same is true of their superior force by reason of primogeniture, which can be employed only to reinforce their living posterity. The dead forbear who can no longer maintain active rela- tionships with those on earth is “completely dead,” as Africans say. They mean that this individual vital force, already diminished by decease, has reached a zero diminution of energy, which becomes completely static through lack of faculty to employ its vital influence on behalf of the living. This is held to be the worst of disasters for the dead themselves. The spirits of the dead (“manes”) seek to enter into contact with the living and to continue living function upon earth. The unconscious, evil vital influence, pg. 131 The unconscious, evil vital influence, pg. 131 The unconscious, evil vital influence, pg. 131 The unconscious, evil vital influence, pg. 131 The unconscious, evil vital influence, pg. 131 Those who have lived among Bantu have of given striking illus- trations of cases in which one finds himself accused of “excising a pernicious influence and is condemned by reason of the illness or death of another, without his being convicted of fault, or even of any wicked intention. Often the elements of proof are entirely lacking and the miscarriage of justice is palpable to an European witness. And yet it is said that the accused, after making a feeble defense, submits, to the declarations and decisions diviners or ordeals, or to the sentence of elders and wise men; and he accepts the penalties"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"420 which are inflicted. Such facts are incomprehensible to the minds of European jurists. I believe that I have found an adequate explana- tion in Bantu philosophy The vital forces are under the governance of God, without hu- man intervention. The hierarchy of forces is an ontological order, founded in the nature of being, not depending only on external agreements and on external meddling. All forces are in relationships of intimate interdependence; vital influence is possible from being to being without recourse to external intermediaries. The vital forces, moreover, are not quantitative, mathematical values, nor are they static qualitative values definable by philosophy. They are active forces not distinct from the being itself, which function not only in them- selves and on themselves; but forces whose actions can pulsate through the whole universe of forces, to whatever extent they are in vital relationships with them. Such vital influence is possible from man to man: it is indeed necessarily effective as between the progenitor, a superior vital force and his progeny-an inferior force. This interaction does not occur only when the recipient object is endowed, in respect of the endow- ing subject, with a superior force, which he may achieve off himself, or by some vital external influence, or (especially) by the action of God. What evil demands restitution? pg. 144 What evil demands restitution? pg. 144 What evil demands restitution? pg. 144 What evil demands restitution? pg. 144 What evil demands restitution? pg. 144 Since, in the minds of Bantu, the worst evil—and, indeed, the only real injustice—is the harm done to the vital force, it should be at least, surprising that they should measure exactly the amount of restitution by the lex tallonis , an eye for an eye. The exact restitution of an object stolen, or the drawing of a tariff of damages, can in no Wise be founded upon their conception of life as centered in man. How can they hope to measure good and evil done to man by, criteria which are external to him? From their point of view this overlooks the essential point; the re-establishment of the ontological order and of the vital forces that have been disturbed. Even when the restitution takes the form of a transfer of natural goods it is considered as part of the re-establishment of life; or, rather, as being a re-establishment of life. Besides and beyond economic damages, the “ bisan-so ” the sorrow or the wrong done to the Man, constitutes the right to reparation. The man, wounded during his Peaceful enjoyment of life, in the fullness of his vital force, the wholeness of his life, has a right to restoration of being. Material indemnities have no other significance than that of achieving the restoration of the man. Conclusion, pg. 78 Conclusion, pg. 78 Conclusion, pg. 78 Conclusion, pg. 78 Conclusion, pg. 78 If one desired to ridicule this philosophy or to give a childish caricature of it, objecting that its concepts do not rest upon the disci- pline of rigorous scientific experience, it would be as well to take care not to commit oneself to arguments more ridiculous than the pre- tended stupidity of these primitive peoples themselves. Is our philosophy based upon scientific experiment? Does de- pend upon chemical analysis on mechanics or on anatomy? Natural sciences can no more refute a system of philosophy than they can create one. Our elders used to possess a systematized philosophy which the most advanced modern sciences have not broken down. Moreover, our ancestors came by their knowledge of being at a time when their experimental scientific knowledge was very poor and de- fective, if not totally erroneous. The tool of empirical science is sense experience of visible realities, while philosophy goes off into intellec- tual contemplation of general realities concerning the invisible na- ture of beings. But no instrument exists for measuring the soul, though this fact does not exclude the possibility that experiences may occur in order to furnish intelligence with reasonable proof of the exist- ence of the spiritual principle in life. It is the intellect that creates science. Indeed the experiments of the natural sciences, as also the generalizations of the philosopher ought to-be made methodically and with discernment and analyzed in accordance with sound logi- cal reasoning. This presupposes that one does not question the ob- jective worth of intellectual knowledge. Happily, primitive peoples are no more tortured with doubt than our subevolues or human rea- soning. And now we will apply this newly-won knowledge to the: The Book of the Jedi The Book of the Jedi The Book of the Jedi The Book of the Jedi The Book of the Jedi Words by George Lucas and Co.

Every time I now watch the Star Wars series I note deeper and deeper religious symbology impreg- nating it. As you’ve read in the Bantu Philosophy introduction, now apply what you have learned towards this text. LOOK for possible parallels and connections. On later read-throughs, try searching for Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian parallels, they’re really in there. By understanding common themes amongst religious systems, one gains a greater appreciation of their vital differences. I suspect that by un- derstanding the unique points on one’s faith, one is strengthened in resolve to hold to that faith; and one also acknowledges areas that are further elaborated in other religions. I consider this book to be a religious text in and of itself. Enjoy!

The son of Skywalker must not be- come a Jedi. Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: If he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally. Emperor: Emperor: Emperor: Emperor: Emperor: Yes ... yes. He would be! Can it be done? Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: He will join us or die, Master. ( On Dagobah ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Why are you here? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I’m looking for a someone. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Help you I can! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I don’t think so, I’m looking for a great warrior. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Great Warrior? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I’m looking for a Jedi Master. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Jedi Master, you are looking for. Come, I’ll show you. ( In Yoda’s home ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Why do you want Yoda? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I want to be a Jedi, like my father. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Your father, a powerful Jedi, powerful Jedi he was. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: You knew my father? Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience. Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: He will learn patience. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Much anger in him. Like his father. Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Ben’s Voice: Was I any different when you taught me? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Yoda... I ... I am ready! Ben! Ben, I can be a Jedi! Ben, tell him I’m re— ( bumps his head on the ceiling ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi! My own council will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one, a— long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away: to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was, mm? What he was doing. Mm. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! ( pokes Luke ) A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless! Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: So was I, if you remember. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: He is too old. Yes. Too old to begin the training. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: But I’ve learned so much. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Will he finish what he begins? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I won’t fail you. I’m not afraid. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: You will be. You will be. ( Luke’s training I. Luke runs through the swamps with Yoda on his back .) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Run! Yes! Yes! A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force! But beware of the Dark Side. Anger, fear, aggression: the Dark Side are they! Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will! As it did Obi-Wan’s ap- prentice. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: ( Stops, panting. ) Vader. Is the Dark Side stronger? Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: No! No. No. Quicker, easier, more seductive. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Then how am I to know the good side from the bad? Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: You will know! When you are calm. At peace! Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: But tell me why I can’t— Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: No, no, there is no why! Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmmm. Mmm. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: ( Sets Yoda down, puts on jacket. ) There’s something not right here. I feel cold ... death. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: That place ( indicates cave ) is strong with the Dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: What’s in there? Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: only what you, take with you. ( Luke takes his weapons.) Your weapons— you will not need them. ( Luke ignores him. He enters the cave and fights a slow- motion battle with Darth Vader, who he beheads. Vader’s mask explodes, reveal- ing the face beneath: Luke’s own. ) ( Luke’s training II. He is standing on one hand with Yoda perched on his foot. ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Good, yes. Feel the Force flow! Yes! Now: the stone. ( Luke lifts a stone through the Force .) Feel it. ( Artoo notices the sinking X-Wing. His whistling breaks Luke’s concentration .) Concentraaaaate! ( Luke and Yoda fall .) Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: ( Looking at X-Wing ) Oh no. We’ll never get it out now! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: So certain are you? Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is—totally different! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: No! No different! only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: All right, I’ll give it a try. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try. ( Luke raises the X-Wing a bit, then drops it. It sinks completely .) Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I can’t. It’s too big. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? (Luke shakes his head ) Hum. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us, and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. ( Pinches Luke’s shoulder ) You must feel the Force around you: here, between you, me, be- tween the rock, everywhere! Yes! Even between land and ship. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: You work the impossible. ( Luke sulks. Yoda raises the ship and deposits it on the shore. Luke is incredulous. ) Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I don’t—I don’t believe it! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: That is why you fail. ( Vader chokes captain Needa through the Force for loosing the Falcon .) ( Luke’s training III. Luke standing on his hands with two boxes levitated .) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Concentrate! Feel the Force flow! Yes! ( Luke levitates Artoo .) Good, calm. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places, the future, the past, old friends long gone. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Han? Leia! ( He drops the boxes and Artoo and falls. ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: —Hmm. Control, control, you must learn control! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I ... I saw a city in the clouds! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: —Mmm. Friends you have there. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: They were in pain. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: It is the future you see. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: The future? Will they die? Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I’ve got to go to them. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could, but ... you would destroy all for which they have fought and suf- fered. ( On Cloud City, in the dining room, Vader blocks Han’s laser bolts with his hand and pulls Han’s gun across the table through the Force .) ( Luke’s departure from Dagobah ) Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Luke, you must complete the training! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I can’t get this vision out of my head. They’re my friends, I’ve got to help them! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: You must not go! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: But Han and Leia will die if I don’t! Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: You don’t know that. ( Apparition of Ben appears ) Even Yoda cannot see their fate. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: But I can help them! I feel the Force. Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the Dark Side of the Force. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yes, yes, to Obi-Wan you listen! The cave, remember your failure at the cave! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: But I’ve learned so much since then! Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I’ve begun! You have my word! Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. That is why your friends are made to suffer. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: That’s why I have to go.. Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Luke, I don’t want to loose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: You won’t. Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Stopped he must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy paths Vader did, you will become an agent of evil. Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Ben: Patience! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: And sacrifice Han—and Leia?

That leads to the Dark Side! Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Yoda: Strong is Vader! Mind what you have learned, save you it can! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: I will! And I’ll return. I promise.

This one is taken from the novelization, but in the film Lando’s hand does go to his throat. Sort of. ) ( The duel I. Luke holsters his blaster.

Vader leaps, and lands between Luke and his lightsaber. ) Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Your future lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: No. ( He is backing towards the pit. Vader lunges—Luke falls in .) Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: All too easy. ( He turns on the carbonite switch with the Force. Luke leaps from the chamber and climbs the pipes above. Vader doesn’t notice .) Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. ( A clang comes from above. Vader sees Luke ) Impressive. ( He slices a hose. Steam spews out. ) Most impressive. ( Luke drops and aims the broken pipe at Vader .) Oomph! ( Luke picks up his lightsaber with the Force and blocks Vader’s next swing with it .) Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear. ( They exchange blows .) Now, release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me. ( They fight. Luke drives Vader off the side of the chamber. Luke deactivates his lightsaber and follows. He enters a connecting tunnel, then the Control Room. Vader appears. Rather than fight, he sends large machinery hurtling at Luke When Luke blocks the machinery, Vader attacks. Then Vader simply hurtles the machinery at Luke, who can’t block it all. One piece breaks the large window, causing a pressure difference which pulls Luke out. He catches a catwalk and pulls himself up. ) Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Vader: Trust your feelings, I’m your Father! Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: Luke: (Luke wines) No, that can’t be! That’s Impossible!

THE RETURN OF THE JEDI ( Luke in Jabba’s palace. He chokes the guards a la Vader to get past them. He plays with Bib Fortunal’s mind like Ben did to the stormtroopers. He also attempts to use his mind powers on Jabba, but they are ineffective. In the book, he leaps to the grate above the rancor and swings around up there out of reach, but the scene was cut from the movie .)

I was once sitting under a large oak tree on a sunny day when I came to the realization that there are a lot of unanswered questions in the world. Think about it, do you know the names of all the people in Ghana; or why do English speakers often put the adjec- tives before the nouns? We live in world awash with doubt and distressed with uncertainty. Will we ever know the right answers to every question? Probably not. However, we live in a society that de- mands answers. To not provide answers is to show incompetence or lack of education. Would you want to look incompetent or unedu- cated? I wouldn’t, but it would seem fated that we will have to con- tinue to live with that persistent embarrassment. I decided that someone had to take care of all these loose ends, even at the risk of giving the wrong answers. I mean, isn’t it better to have an answer, even if it is not THE answer, especially one that works; rather than to stand there and sheepishly say that you don’t have an answer? Once I accepted this monumental task I was faced with a more daunting undertaking than passing my Senior Compre- hensive exercise at Carleton while retaining a social life; providing viable answers to all the possible questions that can be posed in the English language. It was a toughie, but I managed to complete it in a few hours. Drawing upon my extraordinary ability to pull answers out of a baseball cap, I wrote this book. I have intended it to be a quick handbook to use whenever you are confronted with a perplex- ing problem or question. While divinatory purposes are probably not a very effective use of the book, your use of the book is not my concern.

This book has worked many times for myself and I hope it proves so for you. Enjoy! Rev. Michael Scharding June 20th, 1994 c.e. Third Edition Update: Due to the overwhelming desire for more answers, I’ve massively expanded the chapters of answers to provide more customized an- swers. Recommendations 1. If you are not competent in the English language, have a friend help you use this book. 2. Similarly if you are blind, have them read this book to you or type it in Braille so that you can scan it. 3. If no one answer works, try combinations and permutations. Reminders 1. If you are not using the book properly, then you perhaps don’t deserve an answer. 2. Be persistent, it will work if you don’t give up. 3. There’s an answer in this book that works for your question! Introduction: How to use this book There are three chapters to the Book of Ultimate Answers, one each for affirmative, negative and mixed answers. I have found that the Book of Ultimate Answers works best for me when used as out- lined in the following flow-chart: I. Get comfortable. II. Pray and/or meditate for the recommended time (see below) on how to best formulate the question in the English languages. III. Open to the first chapter. A. If an appropriate answer is there, you’re done. B. No luck? Try chapter two. i. If you find an appropriate answer, cool. ii. If that doesn’t work, try chapter three. a. If it worked, you’re done. b. If it you couldn’t find a usable answer then return to chapter one. How Long to Prepare Beforehand Now depending on how difficult or important the question is, you’ll have to formulate the question and ready you’re mind to spot a useable answer in your search. Imagine you’re going to be asking this to Mahatma Ghandi at a press conference. You want to be very clear. This is because your mind is often running many sub-pro- cesses at the same time and it might be actually more concerned with finding an answer to another problem. The result? You get the right answer to a sub-conscious question instead of the one you asked. Remember, the answer may not be the one you want to find, so don’t force it. To help remedy this frequent problem, I’m providing the handy- dandy scale that I recommend to meditate and/or pray before using this book. It’s roughly: Difficulty to Time List Difficulty to Time List Difficulty to Time List Difficulty to Time List Difficulty to Time List Inconsequential: 5 seconds Simple: 1 minute Pesky: 1 hour Important: 1 day Life-Changing: 1 month to a Year Earth-Shattering: 2 years Universe-Shattering: 15 years Future Career/Marriage: 20 years and a day Clarifying Examples for the Scale Categories: Clarifying Examples for the Scale Categories: Clarifying Examples for the Scale Categories: Clarifying Examples for the Scale Categories: Clarifying Examples for the Scale Categories: Inconsequential: What color is a tomato? Simple: What should I watch on TV tonight? Pesky: Should I change brands of shampoo? Important: Do I wish to learn Gaelic? Life-Changing: Do I get a nose-job? Earth-Shattering: Shall I reveal my divinity to CNN? Universe-Shattering: Shall I bestow warp-engine capability to mere mortal Earthlings? Future Career/Marriage: Do I want to marry Alex? Other important notes: Feel encouraged to modify the words in any answer (i.e. the tense, conjugation, plurality, gender, inflection, punctuation, cultural un- derstanding, order, grammatical purpose, spelling or definition) in order to make it a more suitable answer. Remember, you only need an answer that works, not the best answer! Chapter One: Affirmative Answers Could be a positive answer to your question: ‘Fraid so. Yes. Of course! Probably. Because. Easily.

Chapter Three: Mixed Answers You asking a complicated question or one requiring an overly specific answer. I think the answer would be one of the follow- ing: Maybe. Answer unclear, ask later. Do more meditating or praying. You’re not ready to use this book. I’d recommend that you talk with your friend, relative, superior/inferiors. Tricky. That’s a matter of faith, isn’t. You’re not intelligent enough to understand the fine mechanics of the solution. I bet the word(s) you’re looking for are in a dictionary. Wait.

Conclusion: Why this book was really written. Conclusion: Why this book was really written. Conclusion: Why this book was really written. Conclusion: Why this book was really written. Actually, I did write this book for most of the pre-said reasons, in a way. As a Reformed Druid, and a North American one at that, I have a right to say what I believe and other Reformed Druids won’t claim that I’m a heretical Druid. The RDNA lacks recognizably offi- cial dogma and its customs or traditions are very mutable. The RDNA’s official doctrine is summed up in the two Basic Tenets: 1. The object of the search for religious truth, which is a never-ending and spiritual search, can be found through Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; but this is one way, yea!, one way among many. 2. And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual impor- tance, of Nature, which is the Earth-mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it people do live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face to face with it. This is the only statement that all Reformed Druids agree with (and possibly most Druids...). Anything more or less than this is your own variant, and we all bring our own stuff willingly or unwill- ingly. None of us are “pure” Reformed Druids, we are all possessors of differing beliefs, but share a stated agreement with those two iden- tically worded beliefs; irregardless of our own interpretation. Can one have unity through difference? Richard Shelton said “Reformed Druidism is compatible with all religions, even if they deny it.” The way I’ve looked at it, most religions that I’m familiar with use images from Nature at least once to demonstrate or symbolize a theological point; say—a bird building a nest in the spring time. If this is so, then people of all religions should be able to gather and hear the same story of a bird building a nest, and come away with a personal gain of spiritual understanding. This is what the RDNA is about. One of the unstated purposes of the RDNA is to deepen our critical awareness of the foundations underlying our personal, indi- vidual beliefs and/or to understand the roots of our religion(s) or philosophy. In a way, I’ve pursued this goal by writing & publishing my thoughts as a focusing tool for this exploration, because knowing someone will read your musings makes you work harder. But truth seems to be a thing that changes with new facts reveal an unseen twist in your understandings. God is guiding me on a strange path of mysticism to find Her spiritual truths. Nothing that I’ve published is necessarily what I currently believe, at the time that you are read- ing this. Ha! Another side-effect of Reformed Druidism is a desire to pull people’s legs. David Frangquist once stated “The role of the Third Order is keep people guessing....Druidism has it’s tongue planted firmly in its cheek.” I wished to poke fun at a book called “Dianet*cs” and other self-help books that purported to have answers for your personal problems. I think these books cater to those folk who are unwilling to talk with real live people and those who consider any book to be true as gospel if it is published by someone with loads of letters behind their name (esp. Ph.D.). In the Reformed Druid fashion, I have endeavored to bring you to a deeper realization of the inconsistencies inherent in being an ex- pert on other people’s problems, especially about people you don’t even know. The Book of Ultimate Answers actually works, but it may be the wrong way to come to answers. Sometimes the most flawless systems can also be the most devious if they are inappropri- ate. Just because it works doesn’t mean it should be used. Sarah: “I’ve got a splitting pain in my head.” Jean: “Have you considered amputation?” Imagine how many leaders and experts daily make decisions based on blind reliance upon long-accepted collections of official answers (i.e. files, dossiers, scriptures). It’s not that written sources do not contain truths, they do!, but one cannot always use the same answer to the same question. Abiding by precedents can be a problematic habit, as the expression goes: “give a child a hammer and soon every- thing looks like a nail.” One of my other gripes with the self-help genre is that they often have only a very short section of practical answers and advice. What seems to take a great deal of those books (and, incidentally, this one) is a lot of bibble-babble (or Bible-Babel as a friend of mine calls it). The author usually has their own personal philosophy which they would be delighted if everyone else shared. The people easiest to “convert” are those with weak self-images whose insecurity draws them to powerful, charismatic “know-it-alls.” If you are still reading this and are one of those people, you won’t find the answer through Reformed Druidism either (“Druidism is a faith, if not in answering, then in questioning”). You’ll find your answer, if it’s to be found, by your own efforts (possibly divinely aided). The last rumor I’d like to share is that people do not always lie, sometimes they are just misinformed and don’t realize it or (more likely) won’t admit it. I am, myself, greatly “uneducated” in accred- ited forms of theological training. I am merely winging it, which so many “experts” are also secretly doing. I hope this book has jolted you into a deeper speculation of the purpose, motives and capabili- ties of the “self-help book” genre."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"429 The Book of Songs and Poetry Volume One Compiled by Michael Scharding and Sine Ceolbhinn This book is a collection of songs, chants and poems that I have heard used or composed that may be deemed suitable to Druidic usage (or maybe not..).

Chorus And around, & around, & around turns the good earth. All things must change as the Seasons go by. We are the children of the Lord and the Lady, Whose mysteries we know, but will never know why. In all lands the people were tied with the good earth Sowing and reaping as the seasons declared, Waiting to reap of the rich, golden harvest, Knowing her laugh in the joys that they shared. Through Flanders and Wales and the green lands of Ireland In Kingdoms of England and Scotland and Spain Circles grew up all along the wild coastlines, To work for the weather with the sun and the rain. Circles for healing and working the weather. Circles for thanking the moon and the sun. Circles for thanking the Lord and the Lady. Circles for dancing the dance never done. And we who reach for the stars in the heavens, Turning our eyes from the meadows and groves Still live in the love of the Lord and the Lady: The greater the circle the more the love grows. Verse DDGA/DDGD/DAGD/DAGD Chorus DAGD/DAGD/DAGD/DAGD Oimelc Song For Brigit Sam and I wrote a song this Sunday for the Oimelc ritual. We had to work with some major imagery. We had to incorporate a song with new- born lambs, rising sap in trees and Brigit. Brigit is the Celtic goddess of fire, blacksmithing and poetry. She was christianized as St. Brigit. We’re sure we had her rolling on the ground in mirth at our pathetic attempt at a song. Lyrics: Feb. 1st, 1992 Michael Scharding and Samuel Adams Music: The Ash Grove The Hammers are pounding, The new sound is sounding, the forge is resounding with promise of spring. The Good Earth is forming, the new leaves are forming, the birds are performing, the songs that they bring. The New lambs are grazing, your song we are raising, again we are praising you, now as before. Now Brigit enlighten me, strengthen and righten me, sharpen and brighten me, now evermore. Now there are some poor verses worth reminding ourselves with. Writ- ing is a learning process, and many ideas pop up. The only way to get rid of them is to work out the silly verses: Oimelc Silly Song of Brigit The Hammers are beating, the sheep they are bleating, it’s soon we’ll be eating, I brought my own fork. The Good Earth is warming, the sheep they are swarming, we bards are performing, but not very well. The new leaves are budding, the pagans are rutting, we’ll all go streak Nutting, and wave Hi to Skeech. Sam forded the river, its cold made him shiver, we don’t like the winter, please take it away. Oh gods we admire, we can’t start this fire, it’s raising our ire, Damn!, why won’t it start?

REFRAIN REFRAIN REFRAIN REFRAIN REFRAIN The Old Bard April 9th, 1992 by Michael Scharding How good it would be to be an old bard, back in the times when living was hard. I’d sit near the top of the table that’s long and fill hungry minds with the meats of my song. I’d pass their hours thru the longest winter. I’d take them away when the wind was bitter to the land of fruit and youth and pleasure where none can die, and all have treasure. I’d sing of tragedy, the deaths of lovers, who cried in this world, and laughed in the Other. I’d praise the chieftain, whose valor and might would bring us to vict’ry in all of our fights. I’d tell of the Sidhe (SHEE), whose places shine within the hills since the start of time. I’d tell of the strength and the powers of oak, and the things that lurk under night’s blue cloak. I’d sing of our gods: Dagda and his harp, Ogmos of the tongue, Angus of the heart, Lugh of the crafts, Cuchulain the strong, Nuada silver hand, Briccriu who did wrong. I’d play for the Clann the three Bardic airs: the songs that free those weighed down with cares, the songs of tears that brings them to weep, the lullaby that calms and soothes them to sleep. I’d be the link that binds and gathers the youngest bairns to the oldest fathers. But I well know that this life cannot be while I’m still here on this side of the sea.

The Four by Michael Scharding May 27th, 1992 I listen to the music of my harp as fingers twist to a will of their own. I feel the pulsing of my living heart measure the poems by it’s thunderous drone. In the warm groves, I talk with the Good Folk, my toes rooted firmly in Mother Earth. How subtle the changes Time will invoke, Earth is ever-ready for a new birth. I splash the water, rile it with my toes, but it always falls into shape again. Angry, rough seas pounding upon the coasts their strident message is that of Earth’s pain. The desert air flickers with flames of heat and I look out upon the scorched lands. Could I survive long if I were set free? Or would I die and burn upon the sands?

Wisdom, she pushes us onward when we tire. With the, the mind of the wise bard can sing. Och!, how I seek to obtain their prowess.

Here is a song I sang at a Mistletoe Rite of the Henge of Keltria in Minneapolis. It was more or less commissioned by Mec. The Druids and Mages of earliest times Kept the Wisdom of Ages in memorized rhymes But they lost all their files when the System went down If they’d kept the hard copies, they’d still be around. In the year ’63 there were Druids again And they wasted no time putting paper to pen. They saw the Reform, and they though it was good And they all started writing as fast as they could. Epistles and Libers and Writs and Decrees By thirty years on they’d come up to our knees In the Carleton Archives there’s shelf after shelf With half of them needed for Isaac himself. But many were tattered and battered and lost To find and replace them would be of great cost But then came the grace of a well-lettered friend To make sure we’d not lose our Druids again.

The regrettable lack of women is due to the regrettable sexism of the early RDNA; there were great women leaders throughout, but they did more ritual leading than Scripture writing. Which might just explain a few things about the Christian Bible.) The Search by Mec 11/22/92 Do I aimlessly wander the silent hills? Are my sylvan prayers better spent in church?

When I Grow Up by Fer Horn When I grow up, I want wings like a seagull, That ripple as I fly, Starting at the body And spreading to the tips. To soar low above the waves, To swoop up and then plunge Into the water And then bob up like a cork. To fly far and fast, Never touching the shore. A Hand Print by Fer Horn A hand print is an interesting thing To leave on the wall of a cave. What else so eloquently says, “I was here. I Am.” To put your hand there And leave the mark of your passing. A hand, reaching out from the past To the people of the future, Who will come and think On those who Were before And touch their hand to yours. “Yes, we Are.” Dancing Winds by Fer Horn 10-1-91 Tuesday Queenscliff, Victoria Storm driven winds howl through my mind. So like a stormy night at home. It sounds the same in different trees, Whistles in the alley, screams along the sea. It even has the same feel; Of power beyond control, Bringing creatures not seen Out to dance with the blowing trees. Silverton by Fer Horn 10-29-91 Tuesday Silverton, NSW Silverton is a ghost town located outside of Broken Hill, New South Wales. It used to be a mining town until the 1920s when the mines ran out and all the people moved away. There used to be a train that ran from Broken Hill to Silverton. The townspeople of Broken Hill would ride out to Silverton every Sunday in their Sunday-best for picnics. The only occu- pied buildings there are a tourist bar, a museum and a seasonal movie production facility. A voice calling as the sun rose Pulls me out of sleep To stand dimly in the light of the sun Touching an empty town. Something wants my attention Wants me to do something. I wander the streets to listen As the sky tummy to rose, Searching for that which calls me in dreams. The lived-in homes are silent now As is the levee that runs straight to the sky. Echoes of the train to Broken Hill Clatter briefly as I cross But fade away as I stop to listen. Finally, a small white building, Windows peaked in perpetual worry, Catches my gaze. The battered sign reads “Methodist Church 1880.” Ornate black and red grillwork Bars the door a padlock seals. This place is unhappy. Churches should not be barred No matter how old Or that all their people are gone. Let the animals come to worship here If no one else remains.

The Rock by Fer Horn on 10-3-91 Thursday Port Campbell, Victoria “It is very hard to speak to a rock; they have such an odd sense of time and priorities.” —Vanyel Ashkevron, Magic’s Promise by Mercedes Lackey Twelve Apostles standing in the waves. I count 8, maybe 10. I wonder if they are all named. Did someone say, “This is Peter, ‘The rock on which I shall build my church’, And this is John, the Beloved, And Judas, ‘He who would betray’, Or maybe Paul, called on the road to Damascus.” But Damascus is a long way from here, And John is an odd name for a rock. It seems silly to name a rock For a disciple of a man who lived Long ago and far away. Perhaps I should ask the rocks What they call themselves; Surely they have wondrous names. I expect they will be a long time in answering. Silence by Fer Horn on 10-22-91 Tuesday Silverton, New South Wales I never realize how unusual Silence is until I hear it. Everywhere you go now, There are birds, or planes Or the hum of a distant highway Or the murmur of the people you are with. Today, for just a moment, I heard the silence of the Outback, Where, as hard as you listen, The only thing to hear Is the wind flowing through the bush. And I felt like I was standing On the edge of eternity. Looking out over the plain Imagining what it looked like To the first person to stand here. Probably very much the same. And it will probably be the same For a long time to come. This is a place that is hard to live in. What truly belongs is not much; Just the wind and the bush And the eternal silence. May there always be places like this. The End of Mother Nature by Randel Lee Peck Deep dark sky, which makes me write clouds filled with her cottony breath turning black and green with an evil beyond our control MOTHER IS PISSED! For all we do is waste our water Pour pollutants into the sky And into our rivers and lakes; ruining the Earth; Destroying her soul! She has one way of getting back. I understand you can’t take it anymore You just can’t take the pressure of man too much, too much. You break open your womb at your faults The earth is shaking. I know you’re crying—I almost drowned in your tears. And with one blow you can obliterate everything in your path. Lightning can stop anybody dead in their tracks. Drying up our watercrops, and life itself, You almost baked everything away with your radiant first born son, or you can freeze us all, bone chilling frozen hard as a rock. We’ve got to change and change now! Before it’s too late! We have to protect this world, love it, and beautify it! I hope, have we still time? We have to stop our government From having one chance to destroy it all. The world’s end and neutralization, For I fear it will happen. But hopefully there will be somebody left on this earth And I will be one of them to survive. And to live on and teach our children The way things should be, Not, the way they are.

From Ben Nevis by Lawrence “Smiley” Revard I came from the sea to the sky and burnt the blunt bridge of my nose to an itching red crisp, trekking to the jutted head of Ben Nevis. Later, I hiked the valleys alone to the mountainside above Gray Mare falls and onwards; I saw only one shrew and a few fleeing field mice, and felt thousands of midges. Along the way, I thought Scotland was half-dead with English blood. No bears, few eagles, few deer, no wolves, and a tide of tourists. In the unmountainous and untouristed scraggle of Oklahoma, I remembered crouching for a single half-hour and seeing six turkey-vultures and two marsh hawks ride updrafts past a sandstone crag. And I remembered hearing the dear rustle in the persimmon grove below. Once, in the tower of London (where several well-attended but alternatively maniacal and derisive ravens nip popcorn from Italian or American or French fingers), I heard an American ask a portly Beefeater guard how he liked being on a bottle of gin. Well, he said, when off-duty. Atop Ben Nevis there was a monument to the young dead of World War I. There was also a peculiar and anonymous snow bird peeping low among the stones and the company of clouds was miles and miles. From there I could see the dead land was far below in history, like the ruins at Ludlow where (so I’m told) a lord named Lawrence held his castle carefully at the brambled edge of Wales, where one Bertilak and one Morgan le Fey had their hide-out. But this was mostly imagination: there was little to hear since the last thunder of British cannon volleys mowed down the Scots. There was little to see since the trees had fed the ships that fended off imperial onslaughts of Spain, France, and, at last, Germany. And I knew that even half my ancestry had flew their native tongue and the empty, gray-green hills. It is said that when the ravens in the Tower of London are dead, imperial England will no longer stand. Those six days on the highland trails, I saw not even a rabbit carcass, and never did a carrion-black shadow cross my path. The Hill of Three Oaks: Midwinter 1964 A Haiku by Dick Smiley ’66 When the wind blows cold on the Hill of Three Oaks the hearth fire is warm. Salutations! Feb. 1, 1977 by Dale Fierbe Salutations on this day of Oimelc! The Magnolias stand serenely in this winter wind. The pines shrug their branches Snow drops to the ground Unable to smother the spirit Of Evergreen.

The Polished flesh of some long-dead Oak, smoothly grainless, was Carved to artificial perfection by Some zealous artisan. Not alone I stood in the shop, Clutching my saw and knife in An all too sweaty hand. I look At what lies before me, and tremble At its pathetic presumption of merit. Shaking, I turn to the light That pours in Through the window, broken by The frame and the panes. I turn back To my creation to view it once more. Outside the sunlight, it lies dead and Cold, a lifeless bit of wood shaped Randomly into the face of a thing I do not know."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"439 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB Someone Said My Name by Chris Markwyn a name, subtly carved into the bark of some ancient oak, now warped and bent by the ravaging years a name, engraved on a door deep in the dimly lit dungeon of my heart; a chamber sealed by the weight of years a name, whispered in the dark, written on a crumpled page, spoken softly in the quiet’ hours of life’s night a name unheard for years Historiographies of the Books of the Latter-Day Druids THE DEAD LAKE SCROLLS It is worth noting than in the originals, I put in pictures, fancy fonts, amus- ing titles and other items, which would make distribution difficult. They have therefore been removed. With the exception of the Book of Paul, all are authored by Michael Scharding with advice from his friends. This book is mostly to tell Carleton Druids of their past and to record the events of Scharding’s ArchDruidcy of May 93 to May 94. The Book of Introduction As the contents suggest, this book is setting the purpose and mood for the collection. The Book of Years As some of the gaps prove, this was written early in my research on Reformed Druid history. The titles for their different periods are my own and are of little relevance to other people. The Book on John Burridge During his brief time at Carleton as a staff member, John Burridge made a lasting impression on the Druid community. This book was written to honor his memory. The Orange Horse referred to was one of the focal points of Druid life in the campus. I believe it was torn down in 1992. It was kitty korner from Berg house. The Book of Opposition The atmosphere at Carleton since 1984 was getting more and more conservative. Incidents of proselytizing increasingly became annoy- ing to Carleton Druids. Now looking back on this book, I am slightly embarrassed by my paranoia, but it was the first time that I had ever been religiously assaulted. Many aspects of my life changed as a re- sult, and much of my ArchDruidcy after the event was dedicated towards increasing inter-religious understanding among the Druids. Most of these precautions listed were commonplace before I came to Carleton in Fall 1989. I feel that I’ve mellowed a bit since then, and now count it as a moment of enlightenment. The Book of Post Scripts: Part One This recounts Carleton’s 30th anniversary picnic and ritual held at Monument Hill. It also recounts the stages preceding the re-estab- lishment of the official ArchDruidcy. Sam and I became ArchDruids of Olaf and Carleton, before entering the Third Order (officially) although we did vigil like Third Orders before the initial assumption of the Archdruidcies. My official ArchDruidcy began at Andrea’s Third Ordination in June, when she passed the title on to me. The Book of Paul: Part One Written by Paul Schmidt, it tells of the special ceremony that we two performed to give greater strength to the new Third Oak on the Hill of Three Oaks, to ensure it wouldn’t die. It was one of the more complicated ceremonies I had done up to that point. Paul was a good preceptor and I always enjoyed his support. The Book of Haiku I can’t seem to get enough Haiku, and I consider it one of the most effective ways to teach other Druids. Each is a quick and simple lesson, with little verbiage. Its tri-fold nature is also dear to my Celtic proclivities."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"440 The Book of Post Scripts: Part One This book provided a basic understanding of how the Third Order had disappeared from Carleton, and explained why I wished to revive it. There was some distrust of the Third Order, and being disinclined of hierarchy myself, I chose to be very careful of the uses of the office in my upcoming ArchDruidcy. Most of the Druids did not know of the other Druid groves across the country, or about ADF, so I told them about this. I hoped to convey their participation in a larger community. The 1985-1993 Druids had gone on field trips to Pagan Festivals, but we never got around to organizing such an activity, to our own loss, I believe. The Book of Vigils Despite some early reluctance to reviving the Third Order, once I entered it under Richard Shelton, there was a veritable horde of requests to enter the Third Order. I suspect more people were ordained in those 6 months than in 3 of the most busy years in the Reform. Such frequent vigils, with all the necessary preparations, brought the community together for a good sized camping party. Strangely enough, poor weather was the rule when it came to Vigils, but this appears to be a historical constant. The Book of Cattle Raids Basically a wild tale of Sam and Me at the PSG festival of 1993 in Wiscon- sin. It was the first time that I had run into the Henge of Keltria and during this trip I discovered that several NRDNA groves still existed. The Book of the Great Dream Like the April Fool day proselytizing event, this Dream, in May 92, was one of the great inspiring events before my ArchDruidcy. Having returned from Scotland, I was intrigued by the Dalriada group and the international scene of Druidism. I’ve always had interesting dreams, with some degree of au- tonomy within them, so this type of dream was uncommon but not rare. The Book of Stones A collection of myths and stories about Carleton stones; handed down to us from time immemorial. I find the story about the Hadzi particularly doubtful. The Book of Fire A basic collection of fire-related customs at Carleton during my College days. THE DEAD BAY SCROLLS Using the Dead Lake Scrolls & Druid Chronicles as a model, Stephen Abbot (Archdruid of Hazelnut Grove) wrote a history of the Califor- nia Druids since 1980 up until the Thirtieth Anniversary of Re- formed Druidism. The common parallels of tongue-in-cheek humor and faint whiffs of paranoia are intriguing. Although Stephen wrote all these following words, I put them into biblical notational format, for easy reference. This is one of the few NRDNA documents that was not written by Isaac, and it is therefore a good tool for under- standing the various attitudes within the NewRDNA. Das Edda Todvolkfortgeshritten This poem describes the disastrous ritual leading up to the Grove elections at Samhain 1981 in the Berkeley Grove. Difficulties in find- ing the ritual site, along with Isaac’s strong platform of changes should he be elected Archdruid, and a disagreement about voting proce- dures caused an eruption of discord in the Grove. Not long after this pivotal moment, Isaac left to found ADF, the Live Oak grove schised from Berkeley and everybody stopped talking to each other. The leader of the Death March was Joan Carruth. The Co-ArchDruids mentioned were Stephen and Tezera of the Hazelnut grove. The Book of the Boring Times A clever pun on the Neo-Pagan term “The Burning Times” (the Inquisition). I assume the place of the Orks is a military base in the San Francisco bay. As we can tell from this book, Stephen moves around alot and has worked at many types of jobs. The Book of Mr. Boring In some fashion, this work almost seems to be a conversion story about how Druidism can change even the most boring person into an interesting thinker. The Book of Games More discussion about the passing of spare time during the Boring Times. The Book of the 30th Anniversary The author was Anderson, a prominent Wiccan author. The Terlach referred to here is Robert Larson, the founder of the Berkeley Grove. It also tells of how Jeff Sommers was ordained and founded the Tuatha De Danaan Grove in the Bay Area. This book gives a little insight into the attitudes of the NRDNA to the role of the Third Order. It also has a rare reference to a person being previously denied entrance to the Third Order, but eventually entering in time. It is a difficult area to deny entry, as I discuss in my General History. The Book of the Laundry Think-Tank A good overview of the group activities in the Hazelnut Grove. Addendum to the Ordination of the Second Order This is unusual, to add to an traditional ordination ceremony. The fact that they required extra meditation by the Candidate seems to confirm that the NRDNA were less interested in hierarchy than in personal growth. The Book of Samhain Like my own Book of Oppositions, the Hazelnut Grove was having their own problems. The Books of the Jedi Knight As the book says, it is a comparative exercise in religions. I was also drawn to producing it because I felt that the Druids up to this point had not really emphasized the validities of drawing upon African reli- gions or Science Fiction. By choosing Star Wars, I hoped that people would come to realize how much of our culture can have religious undertones, but never indulge in ritual. As a historian, I like to provide documents to people, and then allow them to analyze them. Chris Johnson, although not a Druid, was friendly to many of the Druids. The Book of Ultimate Answers The annoying thing that I found about Druidism was that it couldn’t pro- vide easy answers to people, but it did push the Druids to formulate impor- tant questions. I kind of threw this book together in a tongue-in-cheek man- ner to poke fun at self-help books. I hoped to inculcate the difficulties of seeking wisdom and guidance from outside of oneself. Book of Songs and Poetry Volume One As with the Dead Lake Scrolls, this volume was originally printed with amusing fonts, pictures and musical notation. This book was an attempt to capture all the poems and chants in use during my college days and to preserve some of my bardic explorations. I don’t think many other people read it. Book of Songs and Poetry Volume Two This is not officially a RDNA publication, but was published under a front name of the Friends of the Earth Mother at Carleton College (FOEMACC). The only official Druids in the whole work were me, Dick Smiley and Matt Cohen. The rest of the people were friends of mine who had an interest in Nature poetry."}]
