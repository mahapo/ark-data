Isaac Bonewits and Robert Larson published “The Druid Chronicles (Evolved)” in 1976 under the Drynemtum Press label, and from whose collection much of ARDA’s material can be traced. Richard Shelton and David & Deborah Frangquist were very help- ful in giving me leads and constant advice. I would like to thank Eric Hilleman for providing space at the Carleton Archives for the Carleton Druid Archival Project, for conducting many oral interviews with past Druids, and offering helpful hints in collecting and organizing a mountain of materials. I thank Professor Phillip Niles and Professor Diethelm Prowe for their academic support and counseling during the 1992-1994 period when I was collecting these materials to com- plete my senior comprehensive exercise in the history department. I would like to thank my parents, my friends, room-mates, fellow Carleton Druid grove members, Ar nDraiocht Fein, The Henge of Keltria, all the other groves of the Reform, and the authors of the First Amendment. In order to be true to all my friends, I should boldly state the following about Druidism: The entire RDNA theology is contained in the Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism (Law 4-6): Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism (Law 4-6): Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism (Law 4-6): Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism (Law 4-6): Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism (Law 4-6): 1. The object of the search for religious truth, which is a universal and a never-ending search, may be found through the Earth- Mother, which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 2. And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual importance, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it men do live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face to face with it. ‘Ten Important Notices’ from the current editors 1. All of this material, except for the third Green Book of Part Six and Appendix D & E of Part Eight, is of the Public Domain and is free for you to use and distribute. Nothing in here is consid- ered “oath-bound” material. Please acknowledge the authors, use it only for non-malicious purposes, and not for personal gain. If you produce a book, article, or report that makes significant use of these materials; please send us a complementary copy in care of the Drynemeton press (see above). 2. Please, do not take this stuff too seriously. We certainly do not! 3. Materials represent only the individual opinions of their authors and no one else. 4. We do not have official group dogma. We merely have our indi- vidual opinions. 5. Just because it was printed, doesn’t mean the authors haven’t changed their minds since they wrote the materials. 6. Most Druids get along just fine without ever reading ANY ANY ANY ANY ANY of these unofficial materials. Many (if not most) Druids thrive bet- ter without this literature!! 7. In general... most of us consider Reformed Druidism to be a perspective, not a religion. Do not be fooled by all the external trappings, whistles, and bells. 8. Membership in Druidism is very compatible with all religions and the term “Druid” is usually considered to be gender neutral. Or, at least, we tend to think so. 9. Technically speaking, those who do not have the Apostolic Suc- cession descending from Fisher are not permitted to use most of the liturgies. 10 Within reason, all documents have been presented here in their original historical forms (i.e. after spell-checking and versical num- bering).

Why was this book published? Why was this book published? The reasons behind printing this Anthology are difficult to con- vey to the Reader. I would hope that I’m not doing this work out of pride, one-up-manship, or to prove a point; but the mind can often rationalize the secrets of the heart. Most readers will assume that this Anthology is being printed as a precise manual to preserve our rituals in their purest official forms; essentially to produce orthodox texts. Nope. Except for the occa- sional historian, like me (Michael Scharding), a Reformed Druid tends to see little value in the age of our religious texts. A religion that mandates only one interpretation of a text, or that even only one text be used, has already taken a wrong turn and has reduced the usefulness of its teachings to the value, of, oh.... dung. (No offense.) A piece of dung more than 40 years old is not much more valuable that a piece of dung from 20 years ago. They both smell about the same and make equally usefull fertilizer, but they are not as tasty as the original apple. This text may last two hundred years, but I doubt that there will be anyone around at that point who still goes by the label of “Reformed Druid.” It is possible that the spirit of Reformed Druidism may still continue on, unlabeled, in the hearts of people who have interacted with Reformed Druids. Long after the trappings have passed away, the message of Reformed Druidism will be alive in our lifestyles. Preserving our oldest texts in an uncorrupted form is certainly not the purpose of this Anthology. Could the purpose of this book be to disseminate our unique wisdom to a larger audience? Am I evangelizing to gain converts? Nope. Our only truth is so simple that most people have probably already guessed it all a long time ago, and then gone on with their lives. Most of the readers, after reading these texts, will probably realize that the RDNA is not trying to make more Reformed Druids (there are already too many to keep track of!), but to make people into better Christians, Neo-Pagans, Taoists, Buddhists, Atheists or Whatevers! Reformed Druidism is not in the business of finding recruits, rather, we are merely helping those who have joined us anyway. When and where they choose to go after a short stay with us is up to them. We are not seeking converts. Am I trying to gain influence within the current Reformed Dru- ids? Realistically, I expect that 95% of past and future Reformed Druids will never read anything beyond the Chronicles , if even that much. Most will never even know the existence of this work, and many of those who do may not care. And they may well be living a far more Druidic life that I will ever attain. Experience is difficult to gain from a book, and once gained, no longer needs the book. As Four Guns, an Oglala Sioux, once said: Many of the white man’s ways are past our understand- ing. They put a great store upon writing; there is always a paper. The white people must think paper has some mys- terious power to help them in the world. The Indian needs no writings; words that are true sink deep into his heart, where they remain. He never forgets them. On the other hand, if the white man loses his papers he is helpless. I suspect more Druids will resent this publication than will ever thank me. To try and put Druidism down on paper is a near impossible task and the reader could easily misconstrue the meaning. A symphony can not be put into words. This Anthology may lead as many people onto the wrong path as it may help some, if any. If I mislead you, I deeply apologize and ask you to forgive my impetuosity. If anything, I would consider myself a taxonomist or a biologist who has discovered a new, exotic species. With so many species becoming extinct every day, I would hate to not write about the lifestyle and customs of such a creature. Do as you will with it. My name is Michael Scharding. I wrote this on May 1st, 1996 c.e. INTRODUCTION (with apologies to David the Chronicler) 1. There shall come unto thee those who do inquire: “What is this thing hight Reformed Druidism?” 2. And thou shalt answer them by quoting the basic tenets, for this is the only answer with which all Reformed Druids do agree. 3. Yea, there may be those druids who do have reservations even about these basic tenets. 4. And some there shall be who do understand, and who do gain in awareness. 5. For there are those who do be Reformed Druids, yet who know it not, never before having heard of us. 6. May the blessings of the Mother be upon them. 7. But others there shall be who understand not, and who shall ask again, “What is this thing hight Reformed Druidism?” 8. And thous shalt answer them by paraphrasing the Gread Bard, saying, “It is a tale of sound and fury, signifying what thou wilt.” 9. For, verily, even as Reformed Druids do disagree, so do they agree to disagree. 10. And even as they do agree to disagree, so do they disagree so that they may agree. 11. And some there shall be who do understand, and who do gain in awareness. 12. May Be’al smile upon them. 13. But many there shall be who do grow yet more confused. Yea, even shall they be confused in their confusion. 14. And they shall ask once again, “What is this thing hight Re- formed Druidism?” 15. Then shalt thou pick up this tome and throw it at them. Yea, shalt thou throw it at them even aiming at their most tender parts. 16. And thou shalt intone even as thou dost throw this tome the First (and only) Commandment of Reformed Druidism. 17. For, yea, though it be nowhere written, it is a commandment most dear to all Reformed Druids. 18. And that commandment is this: 19. “Think for thyself, foolish one.” 20. Then shalt thou grow in awareness, even as he doth grow who doth ask. 21. And then shall ye both receive the blessing of the Mother and of Be’al. We have accumulated a lot of verbiage, haven’t we? And we began with such a simple little idea; indeed, as a jest. But doesn’t every- thing begin simply and grow and elaborate? Is not the most complex mathematical formula grown from simple basic (and unprovable) postulates? Are not all the sciences based upon simple observations, which have been elaborated upon through the centuries by a method of inquiry? So it has been with Reformed Druidism. From the acorn of the basic tenets, druidical inquiry fostered an oak. May the future see the oak become a forest, each oak different but related through the original acorn. So it is good to see this new edition of the Chronicles and other accumulated druidical writings. I feel that Brother Michael has done a service to both present and future druids by his compilation. Of course, many druids will find much, if not all, of this book irrelevant to their personal druidical path. This attitude is both right and wrong. While it is correct to say that only the druidical attitude of tolerant individual inquiry in the search for awareness is truly relevant, nevertheless no path to awareness, or expression of belief, can be considered irrelevant to this search. My belief has been and continues to be that all concepts of deity deserve equal respect, as long as they extend the same respect to others. Every belief system, be it mundane or bizarre, tells us much about the relationship of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 human beings to the ineffable and thus helps us define our own beliefs and relationships to Be’al. So while Sturgeon’s Law (“Ninety percent of everything is crap”) certainly applies to all this verbiage, Larson’s Corollary also applies: “Yes, but the crap fertilizes the crop. No crap, no crop.” Brother Michael’s history of the RDNA will also be useful to dru- ids, I believe. Only by understanding the origins and past can we begin to understand the present or to fathom the future. Though I’m sure that nearly every druid will find point of disagreement with his interpretations (for such is our contentious nature), his attempt to present an even-handed and dispassionate view is largely successful. I would expect no less from a brother druid and Carletonian. For his efforts and his sheer persistance, he deserves both congratulations and praise. On a personal level, it both pleased and amused me to learn that the edition of the Druid Chronicles (Evolved) which Isaac and I put out two decades (gods! has it been that long?) ago, for which we took a deal of flak, was found useful in reconstituating the RDNA at Carleton. I’ve always liked irony. Perhaps a similar fate awaits this edition. The production of the DC(E), like this work, was largely a labor of love. The original purpose was to produce a new printing of the Chronicles so that current and future druids who wanted one could have a decent copy. (My original copy was getting pretty ragged from all the use and copying.) The tradition that any Third Order could add whatever he chose to the apocrypha led to the growth of the project and the inclusion of some things many found objection- able. As the person who had to do the printing I was not altogether pleased with the growth. (Perhaps a better title would have been “The Druid Chronicles (Metastasized)). As for the “objectionable content” which might give an unbalanced view of druidism, my atti- tude was that those objecting should contribute their own writings to be included, not criticize other druids’ expressions of belief. Inclu- sion, not exclusion, has always been the guidon of Reformed Druid- ism, as I perceive it. I hope that Brother Michael has had a smoother journey through the job of redaction than Isaac and I had. To those who are reading this book to learn about Reformed Dru- idism I give a warning and some advice. Firstly, druid communications must be taken with a large dose of salt. As a class, we druids tend to discuss trivial matters seriously and serious things jokingly. Often the difference between a serious belief and a joke is obscure, even to the writer. (I’ve maintained that many serious things are jokes, and jokes can be very serious, indeed.) A good sense of humor is essential to understanding the context of druidism. Secondly, druidism is deceptively simple. Only belief in the basic tenets is, by definition, required of Reformed Druids, and these te- nets are intentionally vague, general and subject to individual inter- pretation. So druidism is easy, isn’t it? We, yes and no. (The druidi- cal “maybe”) Druidism is what you make of it, and you get from it according to what you put into it. If you just want a nice service, and a bit of down time and comraderie under the oaks, that’s fine and a grove can provide these. But if you want to use druidism as a vehicle for your own search for religious/philosophical awareness and to define what you truly believe, it can be difficult indeed, for druidism does not tell you what to believe. Rather, it requires you to ask questions of yourself, to answer them with complete intellectual and emotional honesty, and then to examine your answers. The search is truly unending, and the way may be rocky indeed. Finally, a thought to take you into your readings. The Reformed Druids were founded at Carleton College in 1963, which was argu- ably the perfect (inevitable?) time and place. Within a few years young people throughout Western Civilization were exploring exotic reli- gions and philosophies and Neo-Paganism became a notable move- ment. At the same time, the academic world saw an increased inter- est in Celtic studies and an explosion of research in and books on Celtic matters which continues to this day with a resultant increase in knowledge about a people until then largely shrouded in mystery. Were we ahead of our times? Is all this just coincidence? Serendipity? Jungian synchronicity? Perhaps it’s a sign. Peace Síocháin Heddwch Robert Larson D.A.L., Be.

In a woefully inadequate thumbnail sketch ; the Reformed Druids are a group of people from many religions and philosophies who are attempting to find answers to spiritual and philosophical questions. They officially began at Carleton College in 1963 as an attempt to circumvent a mandatory attendance requirement of religious services. Disliking the attitude behind forced attendance, they light-heartedly made up their own “religion” and attended it regularly to see if that was sufficient. After Carleton rescinded the requirement the Druids found that their activity had brought up many questions that weren’t answered yet. They changed their goal from bucking the Require- ment into a quest for personal growth and spiritual exploration. Over the years, they established “missionary groves” to continue their work. One such missionary branch, in Berkeley California, would eventu- ally take itself a litle more seriously and become the first Neo-Pagan Druidic religion in America. From that grove, Ar nDraiocht Fein, The Henge of Keltria and a few other major Druid movements in America would come to trace their roots. Most Reformed Druids continue to disagree with eachother on all other details. Four Helpful Study Guides Four Helpful Study Guides Four Helpful Study Guides Four Helpful Study Guides Four Helpful Study Guides Books contain knowledge and knowledge is a tool. I have pre- sumptuously devised some instruction manuals for various people who may someday use this anthology. I have advice for four types of people who are using this book. Choose the type that works best for you or come up with your own system. 1. A “novice” seeker of Truth. 2. A religious scholar. 3. An experienced Neo-Pagan, Wiccan, New-Ager or Occultist. 4.

You are looking for answers to difficult questions. So are we. We are not gurus and none of us will know all the answers. Reformed Druidism is an unending search. You might already be Reformed Druid and just may not know it. If so, congratulations! If you don’t think so, that’s fine too. My estimation of personal worth is not affected by how many people share my beliefs... or I like to think so. Let’s face it, this is a big collection and it all looks very compli- cated. Druidism is very simple, perhaps so simple that you will pass by its message and keep looking for a more complex answer. Druid- ism is merely asking questions to yourself and to others and not stopping until you get honest answers. No kidding, it really is that simple! It’s also that difficult. If you cannot accept that, then you should put this book down. Everything else in this collection is just an affirmative elaboration on this point. Remember that all one has to do to be a Reformed Druid (at least in the Spirit of the law) is to agree with the Basic Tenets as listed in verses 4-6 of the Book of Law which can be found in the Druid Chronicles (Reformed), and I quote: 1. The object of the search for religious truth, which is a universal and a never ending search, may be found through the Earth- Mother, which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 2. And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual importance, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it men do live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face to face with it. Any Druid who claims any further requirement to be a Reformed Druid is not following the tradition of the Reform. Most people have already come to those two conclusions by their own brainpower and could well already be considered First Order Druids in the Body of the Reform, even if they haven not drunk the consecrated Waters of Life to thereby also become First Order Druids in Spirit of the Re- form (cf. Chapter One of the Customs of the Druids to be found in the Chronicles ). Therefore, having read only this far, I’m sure you are now fully capable of closing this book and continuing on your study of the Reformed Druidism through the active medium of your own life and the world that surrounds and permeates you, without ever having to read from this collection again! So why did I bother to construct a study program? Partly because it was fun for me. Partly, because a friend asked me to make one and because eventually somebody else would have again pestered me into making one. The better question is why do you need a study pro- gram? Perhaps because, if you read this book straight through, from cover to cover, you will only get confused and may not enjoy it. I know of no one, including myself, who would ever want to follow that method! Would you read a French dictionary from cover to cover just to learn a definition of the word “terre-neuve”? The easiest way to begin to understand a new religion or culture is to listen to its favorite stories. Treat each of the articles in this anthology as a story, not as a textbook or cookbook. We’re not going to quiz you and even I don’t know all this stuff verbatim (nor would I ever care to!). If you don’t like one of the articles, don’t read it!!, and just skip around until something else catches your eye. However, some of you egg- heads may wish to learn more of the past, in an orderly structured fashion. For you, I have devised a study program. Reasons not to Undertake the Twelve Step Study Program Reasons not to Undertake the Twelve Step Study Program Reasons not to Undertake the Twelve Step Study Program Reasons not to Undertake the Twelve Step Study Program Reasons not to Undertake the Twelve Step Study Program You should have no doubts that tere is only one entirely optional entirely optional entirely optional entirely optional entirely optional possible schedule, yea one among many ways, for reading this book I jokingly refer to it as my “Druidic Twelve Step Program” and I made it up by myself in December 1995, so in all likelihood you’d be amongst the first to try it out. Please, don’t expect anyone else to have ever heard of it or to be impressed that you worked on it. Also, I would indeed be saddened if you were studying Reformed Druidic texts in order to “quote scripture” at other Druids to get your own way. Your participation in such a program should only be because you you you you you want to explore the issues of Reformedly Druidical thought for your personal benefit. The Reform has not required any training program of its members. Let me explain: In the past, people would attend a few rituals to get the feeling for the RDNA before entering the First Order. Similarly, because people often entered the Second Order to act as Preceptor in a service, they would generally become familiar with the text of the average liturgy in use. Those intending to enter the Third Order would often study the liturgy a little more, because they might have to perform a service, and usually by that point they would probably have read (at least once) the five books in the Druid Chronicles (Reformed), and they probably meditated before making a life-long commitment to the Reform by entering the Third Order. Some people entered these Orders as a sort of spiritual maturation rite of passage and never"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 intend to perform a liturgy in their entire life! Indeed, some people have spent all of 30 minutes skimming the texts of the Reform be- fore feeling ready for the Third Order. I’ve even ordained someone who hadn’t even read the Chronicles ! So if you are seeking an even- tual path to ordination to the First Order or above, you DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT have to participate in this program, just locate a friendly local Re- formed Druid and save yourself a lot of time and effort. Spending all that time amongst the past writings of Reformed Druidism may in fact hinder your own participation, when you should be more con- cerned with the more important present or future of your own Re- formed Druidism! Therefore proceed only if you desire questions, because that’s all you will get from this study, but hopefully they’ll be good questions that will take you to other fulfilling studies. How to proceed in the Druid Twelve Step Study Program How to proceed in the Druid Twelve Step Study Program How to proceed in the Druid Twelve Step Study Program How to proceed in the Druid Twelve Step Study Program How to proceed in the Druid Twelve Step Study Program The basic maxim of the study program is “slow and steady ploughs the farm”. It may easily take over three months to fully finish this reading regimen that I have listed below. Inspiration often comes unexpectedly with the raw passage of time, so do not despair. Going slowly allows you the time to digest what you read. I have gone through several plateaus (sometimes lasting nine months) during my first five years in trying to understand Druidism, and I have had many excel- lent teachers and fellow Druids to talk with. Each step of a phase should take a few days, or perhaps even a week or two, but you may choose your own pace. I recommend that after finishing each step, meditate a bit, and re-read your favorite parts. Definitely, it may help to let a few days pass before proceeding to the next step. Go as far as you need. After placing the issues in a generic context, discuss them with a friend. Druidism is best absorbed with a cup of tea, a warm cat, and a pile of cookies. I have added a few questions and comments to think about before you begin on each step. If you’d like to (and have nothing better to do, like going outside to a park for a pleasant walk) you can write little mini-essays for yourself on the questions I have included in each step, or make up your own questions, or you can ignore the questions. Do not send the essays to me or expect anyone else to review them, but feel free to donate the better quality essays to the Druid Archival project for storage. I also welcome the submission of alternative study plans that you may come up with based on your first-hand experiences of studying Reformed Druidic scriptures with a clean slate of mind. Who knows, someday your recommendations just might get read by someone.

Begin by reading the five books of The Druid Chronicles (Reformed) in Part One. They will essentially provide you with a colorful history of what happened during the very first year of Reformed Druidism. The Chronicles are also handy collection of early customs, tentative rules and meditations which David Frangquist (the third Archdruid of Carleton) thought would be useful for incoming Druids to know about. • What a group does in its first years can often tell you a lot about them. • The DC(R) were written at the conclusion of the year of found- ing, and may be Frangquist’s attempt to prepare the foundations for his formative Archdruidcy. • With the possible exception of recruitment leaflets, DC(R) en- joys the honor of being the most widely read text within the Reform. • Footnotes help, but if you will read this twice, read it the first time without referring to the footnotes, trying to get a feeling for it as a whole work of literature. • Keep in mind, they often have their tongue firmly planted in their cheek. The language is awkward, because they thought it sounded funny and formal that way. • The message is far more important than the ceremonies, holi- days, or hierarchy. • How many biblical allusions can you spot? • My favorite part of the Chronicles is the book of Meditations. • The book of Meditations, incidentally, has nearly all of the pas- sages from the entire Reformed literature that talks about the vague Be’al and Dalon Ap Landu. I suspect that most later Carleton Druids concentrated more on the perceptions of Dru- idism and did not really concern themselves with building a mythology. Curiously, even the NRDNA of Berkeley, which be- came heavily Neo-Pagan, did not elaborate much upon these name- archetypes. Step 2. Views on the Reform by early Druids besides Frangquist. Step 2.

Views on the Reform by early Druids besides Frangquist. Read just the first seven books of The Books of the Apocrypha from The Book of Faith up to and including Letter to My Brothers in Part Two. The Apocrypha are a collection of letters and sermons by Re- formed Druids that were written after the Druid Chronicles (Reformed) were written by Frangquist. Step 2 stops with the letters written in May 1974. We will pause in our reading of the Apocrypha, as these letters represent the quieter period of early Druidic expansion, be- fore the Isaac Affair stirred things up. We will continue the Apocry- phal readings in Step 6, when you’ll have understood more about the thoughts of Reformed Druidism during the early years. • Consider these letters as by-products of Druidism in action, not as dogma. • Note the individual styles. • These books are light in spirit and provoke friendly introspec- tion. • Don’t move on to the remaining Apocryphal books, yet, as they are fiercer. • After reading a selection, read the matching historiography at the end of Part Two.

Browse through The Three Green Books in Part Six over a few days. An important part of a Druidic service was the reading of a short meditation and then followed by a period of silence. Many Druids considered this part of the service to be very special for their spiritual growth. The Green Books contain samples from the many religions of the world, considered to be Druidic in spirit by their collectors. You can tell a lot about a group by the kinds of stories they would tell. Although most Groves would come up with their own readings (or sit quietly), the Green Book was only really known at Carleton. Please note that volume 1 comes from Carleton’s 1963-1976 period and volumes 2 and 3 are from the 1993-1996 period. • Skip the ones that look boring, perhaps coming back to them later. • Pause for a few minutes after reading each selection, and medi- tate quietly. • You may meditate on how these selections fit into their “home” religions, but also consider whether they illuminate an already existing aspect of your own faith. You’d be amazed at what lee- way exist in the corners of many religions. • It is interesting that many of these selections become more inter- esting with the passage of time between readings. • If you enjoy one particular area of readings, perhaps the Chris- tian or Bahai selections, then go to a library or bookstore and do"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 some further exploration. • Ask friends for their favorite collections of religious stories. If you find a good collection send some of your favorite short sto- ries, quotes or lessons into the Archives or to other Groves. Perhaps you might wish to start your own little Green Book collection and eventually publish it. The trick is that they must understandable to someone with little background knowledge. • Occasionally return to Part Six and see if something then looks interesting. Step 4.

Casually skim through the Traditions, Customs and Other Irrel- evant Trivia in Part Four. This section explains the pesky terms that are peculiar to Reformed Druidism. The value of acquainting your- self with the location of these sections, and their general contents, may help you when you try to understand the debates in Steps 6, 7 and 8. • Acquaint yourself with the location of the selections, but do not memorize them. • Skip areas that don’t look useful now, like calendars. You can always return. • This area is a reference tool, only to be studied when necessary. • This is a heavily fossilized area, so beware of falling dinosaurs. • At this point, you have now read more about Reformed Druid- ism than 95% of all the Druids in the Reform.

I’ve delayed this part of ARDA, because many Reformed Druids have seen ritual as a perennial distraction from Druidism and occasion- ally as a potential cause for fierce debate. This collection represents almost 90% of all the written liturgies that I’ve been able to get my hands upon. I suspect they represent less than 5% of all the actual scripts ever performed by Reformed Druids. Some of the time, Dru- ids used either the original Black book scripts at Carleton upto 1980, or the DC(E) versions amongst the NRDNA, with a great deal of improvising by both groups. The rest of the time they just winged it. • You may wish to review the calendars and holidays of the vari- ous branches of the Reform found in Part Four, so that you can understand why the liturgies have different themes and activities depending on the time of the year. • What types of opinion exist within the Reform about the role of liturgy both within the Reform itself and in the context of man- kind as a whole? • Understand the liturgical and secular roles of the three officers of a Grove. These roles differed occasionaly between groves and after 1976 it gets more complicated amongst the New RDNA of the West Coast and the SDNA. • What is the role and purpose of ritual, routine or liturgy in your life? • Notice certain common contents between liturgies. Why are they popular? • Notice flagrant deviations from the standard model. Are certain parts less useful or possibly distasteful to certain Druids? • How do the Reform’s various liturgies and orders compare to those found in religions that you are familiar with? • If you are interested in the mechanics and theory of writing ceremony, pay attention to Robert Larson’s and Isaac’s materi- als. Isaac’s epistles in the Apocrypha, and his book “Real Magic”, describe his own attitude towards magical liturgies, and his groups in Ar nDraiocht Fein have done further work with his ideas and those of other Neopagan Druids. Do not assume that everyone in Berkeley agreed with Isaac as the Oral History tapes and com- ments from the Dead Sea Scrolls of Part Nine and the publica- tions of Part Twelve will amply demonstrate. • Try composing a Reformed liturgical rite for yourself. What would a Druidic “baptism” or funeral service be like? Which elements would you keep and what innovations do you feel are appropri- ate? Send in a copy for the Archives with an essay about your ideas.

This collection of letters show the initial reactions to a revolutionary letter sent by Isaac to the entire Council of Dalon Ap Landu, the legislative body of the Reform. Step 6 through Step 8 are some of the most confusing sections of the study program because most of the Druids involved in the debate didn’t know much about eachother and the concept of Neo-Paganism had only really been invented in 1973, about a year earlier • Go slow, and use your reference skills from Step 4 to look up more information on the difficult terms and topics being ban- died about. • It is vital to remember that these are personal opinions not doc- trinal statements. • If you feel rising emotions of anger or partisanship, examine them. • Up to now, you haven’t seen Reformed Druids argue. Don’t choose sides, but observe the arguments? What are the most interesting statements, in your opinion? • After each selection, read the corresponding historiography, and then review your opinion. Has your opinion or understanding changed? Why? • You may have to refer to Part Four for clarifications on terminol- ogy. • Notice the attempt to respectfully discuss their deeply personal opinions.

Read from the second part of The Book of Changes upto and the Second Epistle of Isaac as found in The Books of the Apocrypha in Part Two. Isaac’s vote was taken and a sort of stalemate was reached. The Reform developed three branches at this point, essentially an status quo group retaining the name RDNA, a radical experimental ver- sion known as the Schismatics Druids of North America, and a moderate party known as the New RDNA. The turn of debates is turning more towards issues of imporving communication to pre- vent future flare ups . The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) collection is put together during this period. • Follow the same steps as in Step 6. • When is a faction a mob-mentality and not a coalition of indi- viduals? • It is intriguing how even the most individualistic Druids will sometimes rely on local custom rather than personal understand- ing or experimentation. • What’s are the pros and cons of the proposed hierarchy upon Reformed Druidism?

Basically this collection is a winding down of the debate. Isaac stopped writing letters about change, and simply started printing a magazine known as The Druid Chronicler, in which Druids could hold discussion on various topics. Those"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 articles are to be found in Part Twelve of ARDA. • Again, follow the same steps as in Steps 6 and 7. • Notice where opinions have changed or where differences are acknowledged. • Summarize the important debates of the Isaac Affair. • What is your current inclination on these issues? Note them now, and refer back to them in a few years to investigate how much your opinions change over time. • Consider studying these generic issues through other non-Dru- idic books.

Review your previous notes and then read from the front page upto and including Chapter Seven of A General History of Reformed Druidism in America in Part Eight. You have now read enough pri- mary sources (i.e. first hand accounts by eye-witnesses) that you have developed some well-grounded opinions of your own about the Re- form. Now here’s my overview of the history of the Reform, but I don’t expect you to agree with me. Perhaps it’ll fill in some chinks, provide intriguing trivia, put things into perspective and perhaps help you to understand me a little bit. • This is a very large reading. Break it down into separate read- ings, as you see fit. • Remember that this is just a long epistle laden with my own personal opinions. • Notice the resources used; documents, oral interviews, and wild conjecture. • How could Scharding’s Carleton & Zen-Christian inclinations bias my history? • Compare or contrast the underlying messages of A General His- tory with Scharding’s shorter epistle “The Book of Lacunae” found in the Apocrypha. • What would be different if this history were written by Bonewits, Larson or Carruth? You’ll find published books by Bonewits in Appendix C of Part Eight and amongst Ar nDraoicht Fein. All three Berkeleyite authors have letters in the Apocrypha, in the NRDNA publications of Part Twelve, and on the Oral History tapes and miscellaneous letters which are available from the Carleton Archives. • What a historian does not talk about is very revealing.

Do not feel compelled to read any of further selections. There may be more important things to do in your Druidical life. Each of the following selections are oriented towards special interest areas within the Reform. • At this point the remaining parts of ARDA become more spe- cialized and are usually only of specific interest to the Grove that wrote them, if even that. • The Great Druish Books were written by, about, and for the Hasidic Drues of the Arch Grove of St. Louis. Notice the attempt to blend some of the perceptions gained from the Neo-Pagan vari- ety of Reformed Druidism into Jewish tradition. • An intriguing aspect of The Great Druish Books , despite their incredibly dogmatic appearance is their leniency. • The Druid Miscellany is mostly of interest to the Berkeley Grove and those pursuing a Celtic Neo-Pagan variety of Reformed Dru- idism. • The Books of the Latter Day Druids in Part Nine is an eccentric collection of books written by Reformed Druids since 1992 dur- ing the Clinton Renaissance. • The Dead Lake Scrolls within Part Nine are from Carleton, mostly by Michael Scharding with advice by other Druids. They’re rather goofy, but they indicate the earlier phase of his Druidic (mis)understanding. • The Dead Sea Scrolls within Part Nine are from the Hazelnut Grove in California and show how they survived the tumultuous conclusion of the Isaac Affairs, and still kept their sense of hu- mor and tolerance. The Dead Sea Scrolls, along with the oral history tapes and some of the later works of Part Twelve are good balancing opinions of the internal diversity of the Berkeleyites. • The Book of the African Jedi Knight within Part Nine was Scharding’s attempt to provide some African materials and also compared Bantu beliefs with some of the religious element of the Star Wars Saga. Indeed, science fiction often explores religious and cultural possibilities that have not yet been attempted. • The Book of Ultimate Answers within Part Nine is a joke on the self-help genre and pokes funs at the divination practitioners. • The Books of Song and Poetry within Part Nine are various poems in use during the Scharding Archdruidcy at Carleton. • The Oral Histories of Part Ten and The Regular Druid Publica- tions of Part Twelve provide more insight into the history and developments within the various varieties of Reformed Druid- ism at Carleton and elsewhere.

At the end of every project there should be a time to pause and assess the outcome and progress that has been attained. • Ask yourself, “What lessons have I learned?”. Meditate for a while. • Ask yourself, “Which could I apply to my life?”. Meditate again. • Participation in this study program did not require dropping your religion and become a Druid. It hopefully required you to think. • You have studied a great deal of written texts by Reformed Dru- ids. Now realize, as I explained in The Book of Lacunae, that all of these Druids received THEIR inspiration from Nature and not from books. • A Druid is a Druid because they are a Druid. • Most Druids find that the insights of Druidism (whatever they may be) will make their studies and practice of religion more useful and challenging. • Ask yourself, “What more is there to learn?” Go and learn it."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Certificate of Completion for the Novice Study Program Most study programs hand out a certificate of accomplishment, so here’s one if you feel like you need one. The Deanship of Druid Textology, regularly abbreviated as D.D.T., was first administered by Frangquist in April of 1970 to McDavid for his efforts of internal cross-referencing for a new edition of The Druid Chronicles (Re- formed), which wasn’t really redone until the 1978 release by Morrison. By the time you finish your studies, you’ll realize that most Druids do not put much stock in titles and some actually do so only for mischievous purposes. However, some people welcome a chance to display an intellectual achievement has been performed. For those people, I offer them a chance to devise a certificate for their DDT. Feel free to duplicate and adapt its structure to a horizontal 8 1 / 2 x 11 sheet of paper, filling in the appropriate blanks. I recommend for a lower left seal, perhaps using a picture of a Nature scene using a color copier. Most copy shops can provide fancy border strips to line the edging or a word processor can put a blackline box around the whole thing.

You are probably un- familiar with how to categorize Reformed Druidism. The simple an- swer is, “Don’t”. I can’t do it and I’ve tried very hard. If you think you’ve succeeded, then you’re probably ignoring all the exceptions. Druidism is just Druidism.

Although most of the Reformed Druids do not consider them- selves Neo-Pagans, they often resemble the Neo-Pagans in the way they think outside of traditional Western thought. Adler’s book is a very good back to use alongside this Anthology, and they even have a chapter in there about us! It’s available everywhere, find out if there is a newer edition has been made since 1986. Daniel Hansen has written a book called American Druidism: A Guide to American Druid Groups , ISBN 0-89716-600-0. If you have trouble finding it, it should be available from Peanut Butter Publish- ing, 226 2nd Ave W. Seattle Washington 98119 (206)281-5965. It is a good concise overview of the Neo-Druid movement.

The important choice for you to make is whether or not you wish to start by reading my History of Reformed Druidism in America (in part eight). I probably have a Carleton bias in my writings and I have the advantage of hindsight, which the earlier Druids did not have. By following the beginner’s program you will follow the Re- form opinions develop and diversify over time. Also from following the development of primary sources, you can watch trends and events develop unexpectedly. The opinions that you will develop on your own will be markedly different than they would be if you started with my History. Of course, starting with the History may put the whole study in a quick perspective. Most of the questions discussed in the beginner’s regimen are probably appropriate for you also. However, if you don’t find them challenging enough, here are some tougher questions for you to pon- der: 1. What is really important in a religion? 2. How do labels limit understanding? 3. When does an irreverent joke become a respectable tradition? 4. What is gained or lost from such a transition? 5. At what point does a religion exist? 6. The Reform began by poking fun at Christianity, but does its own evolving history end up following the same course of Chris- tianity and other developing religions amongst oppressed mi- norities? 7. Is Druidism really as unique as it claimed, or did they not know better? 8. How does Reformed Druidism resemble Quakerism? 9. How does Reformed Druidism resemble Taoism or Zen? 10. How does Reformed Druidism resemble Universal Unitarian- ism? What to do when you’re done? What to do when you’re done? What to do when you’re done? What to do when you’re done?

I would gladly welcome copies of any papers that you produce using these materials, or if we’re only a small part of a larger book, just send a photocopy of the parts relating to us. I also take com- ments on this collection very graciously. My next ten years are un- stable geographically, but you can always write to the International Druid Archives, Care of Carleton College Archives, 300 North Col- lege Street, Northfield, Minnesota 55057. They can find me and will gladly take possession of any contributions of your materials. After finishing your study here, there are several natural exten- sions of study: 1. Teach it as a class. Copies are available free on disk and they you can print as many copies as you want. 2. Go to the International Druid Archives and study a specific issue or grove in depth. 3. Critique by presentation severely and send me a copy 4. Study the growth and activities of Ar nDraoicht Fein, the Henge of Keltria ect. 5. Study the Neo-Pagan movement in general. 6. Compare American Druidism with European Druidism. 7. Compare Neo-Pagan movements with Christian movements seek- ing a return to the original faith of the Christians. Type Three: Advice for Neo- Pagans, Celts, Wiccans, etc. I assume that you’ve been practicing a “fringe religion” for a few years already, and like the religious scholar, you know your way around the block. Yet you are like the “novice” seeker of truth, because you fully intend to incorporate any discovered wisdom into your life. There’s a good chance that you are raiding ARDA for materials to take “home” with you. You are welcome to do so, but be careful not to call it Reformed Druidism and remember to give us some credit. If you are reading this collection because you think that we know the secrets of the Ancient Celtic Druids, um. . . you’re probably in the wrong place and should be looking elsewhere or try contacting one of the more Celtic oriented NRDNA groups (see below). Don’t despair! I have provided a reasonably good bibliography of books on Celtic Druidism, both modern and ancient varieties, in Appendix C of Part Eight of ARDA. Isaac’s outdated 1976 Druid bibliography in Part Seven of ARDA, may also have some leads in it. There are also addresses for modern Druid groups, at least those existing in 1996, in Part Seven also. If you live near Minnesota, you can visit the Druid Archives and thereby read the literature of several extant and extinct Modern Druid groups. In any case, I’m sorry if we have distracted you, but feel free to visit. You will probably already understand the Neo-Pagan mindset, and so you will be able to appreciate this collection a lot faster than the religious scholar. For you, there are certain practical benefits that you can take home to own coven or group. Here are some things to think about as you read: 1. Should your group produce a collection of its own? 2. This Anthology was only possible because of decent record keep- ing from the beginning. What habits do you suspect were used? 3. Why don’t the Reformed Druids keep their materials secret? 4. Is it better to deeply understand the purpose of religion before choosing one? 5. Why do religions choose definitions that exclude people? 6. What is the role of organization and ritual in religion? 7. Issues of power of leaders over followers and vice-a-versa. 8. The role of open communication in running a religious group. 9. The difficulty of transforming an established group. 10. Why? Where to study after working on the Reformed Druids? Where to study after working on the Reformed Druids?

For relatively fresh Reformed Druids: For relatively fresh Reformed Druids: For relatively fresh Reformed Druids: For relatively fresh Reformed Druids: For relatively fresh Reformed Druids: The most important thing that I can tell you is not to take this material too seriously. Certainly we talk about important issues, but that doesn’t mean that you have to be afraid to think for yourself. If you don’t like something, and you’ve thought about it, then don’t agree with the author! This is a collection of opinions from dozens of Druids, not one of which can definitively speak for the Reform, only for theirselves. A Druid is a Druid because they are a Druid, not because someone else calls them a Druid. I recommend that you follow the advice for the novice seeker of truth.

What can you do with it? (Rude jokes aside, now) 1. Use it as evidence that I’ve gone mad and write long detailed letters proving it. Make sure to send me copies, via the Archives. 2. Make a copy for your local university’s reference section. 3. When someone asks you about Druidism, throw this book at them. Whether they read it or not isn’t the point. 4. Keep it around as a handy portable archives. 5. Door stop or paperweight or boat anchor. Well, if you really liked Isaac’s Druid Chronicles (Evolved), you’ll find most of those materials are still in here. The introductions, commentaries and endnotes have been heavily edited or lengthened to put them in my perspective of the Reform’s long history. Heck, you might even want to try the study course that I suggested. There are significant additions that you may find interesting to inspect: 1. Historiographies on most of the publications. 2. Eleven new books to the Apocrypha that dialogue with the origi- nal contents. 3. Many versions of the Liturgy that you haven’t seen. 4. Carleton’s calendrical system and additional trivia of Part Four. 5. The Green Book, rarely seen outside of the Carleton Grove 6. A General History of Reformed Druidism. 7.
