[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PART FOUR TRADITIONS, CUSTOMS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT TRIVIA Introduction We often notice the big differences between groups, but I believe that it’s the smaller details that bring a group to life. Over the thirty or so years, the Reform has come up with its own peculiar laws, rainments, ritual accessories, favorite books, titles, vocabulary, at least two sets of calenders, holiday customs, symbols and other traits. These are often the most difficult aspects for newcomers to learn and are often the first details that are forever lost when a group goes into abeyance. This is but a limited collection, but some of the more widespread and longevous traits of the Reform. Perhaps this is good, because they are only a sideline to the real search for religious truth. Do not get overly worked up over them, since most of us don’t consider them very vital to the pursuit of Druidism, perhaps more of a decoratory function. If you can come up with a better way of run- ning your Druidism, feel free to forge ahead, rename things and so on. Just remember that you and I can speak for nobody’s opinions and actions but our own.

An astute reader can find all kinds of loopholes, and that is okay, since many of the passages were made with the intention of allowing a liberal interpretation. Most of the decisions don’t directly af- fect the average layperson, but rather mostly shape the duties and privi- leges of the Third Order. Bracketed words for gender inclusivity have been added by myself in 1994 and are warranted by the intentions of the legislation.—Scharding] 7 May 1964. Voted: Patriarch To elevate David H. Fisher to the office and order of the Patriarch of the Order of Grannos (the 4th—healing springs). Liturgy To adopt the Order of Worship of the Carleton Grove (as formu- lated by David H. Fisher) as the basic order of worship of the Re- formed Druids of North America. 26 May, 1964. Interpreted: Higher Orders (a) that the purpose of the higher orders is to stimulate priests of the 3rd Order to continued spiritual inquiry, and are intended to honor achievement rather than tenure. (b) That the higher orders are equal in the sense that no shall be considered a prerequisite for any other (except with regard to the formula for the election of Patriarchs [or Matriarchs]). (c) That direct confirmation of the selection of each priest for a higher order must be made by the Patriarch [or Matriarch ]concerned. (d) That the ceremony of induction may be performed by any mem- ber of the order. 27 January, 1965.

(b) To reserve to all the priests, collectively in the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, the highest authority of the Reformed Druids of North America. Priestesses (a) To delegate to the priest the right to individually consecrate priest- esses to any order which they (the priests) may hold. (b) To allow priestesses to hold the office of Arch-Druid, provided that they have first vigiled and been granted the right to perform the ceremony by the Council of Dalon Ap Landu. Interpreted: Missions (a) That any priest has the right to conduct worship and receive members into the First and Second Orders. (b) That no one has the right to consecrate priests of the Third Or- der except the duly elected Arch-Druid of a legally constituted Grove, i.e., a Grove which has adopted a constitution and filled by election the offices of Arch-Druid, Preceptor, and Server. (c) That the ceremony for the consecration of a Third Order priest as adopted at Carleton may not be altered without the permission of the Council. (d) That the local Groves retain the right to organize themselves in any way which will best serve their needs. Liturgy (a) That the waters-of-sleep shall be used during the winter half (Geimredh & Earrach) and the waters-of-life shall be reserved for the summer half (Samradh and Foghamhar), except when they are needed for healing or for the consecration of a priest. The priest shall wear the red ribbon when consecrating the waters-of-life, and he [or she] shall wear the white ribbon when consecrating the waters-of-sleep, both as the mark of the 3rd Order.

(c) That the first Patriarch [ or Matriarch ] of each higher order shall establish the ceremony and identifying mark of his [or her] order. (d) That the individual Groves retain the right to establish any such identifying marks for its officers as it sees fit, provided that they do not conflict with any other marks already adopted. 29 March, 1966. Voted: (by mail) Priestesses (a) To grant automatically to all priestesses who have conducted a vigil the right to perform the ceremonies of Reformed Druidism. (b) To allow a priestess, while holding the office of Arch-Druid, to consecrate priests of the Third Order and priestesses unto the Order which she herself holds. 20 April, 1966. Voted: (by mail) Council (a) To require the Arch-Druid of Carleton, upon their retirement from office, to prepare a report on the state of Reformed Druidism at Carleton, including such information on Reformed Druid activities elsewhere as they may have received, and including a list of Council members and Council resolutions; this report to be submitted to all members of the Council, the expense of the printing and distribu- tion of said report to be fixed by him and charged to those who receive it. (b) To require each Arch-Druid to promptly forward to the Arch- Druid of Carleton notice of the formation of any Grove and the name and address of any priest consecrated to the Third Order in that Grove. 1 May, 1971 Voted: (by mail) Priestesses (a) To subordinate all previous resolutions of the Council concern- ing priestesses to this one. (b) To allow a priestess who has conducted a vigil and who has been consecrated to the Third Order all prerogatives of the order, conse- crate priests and priestesses to the Third Order. In token of this she is known as a priestess of the Third Order. (c) To allow a priestess of the Third Order who has been consecrated to a high order and whose consecration has been confirmed by the Patriarch of the given order all prerogatives of that order. Again, she is known as a priestess of the given order.

The Carleton Arch-Druid then writes to all the Third-Orders and starts a debate. 6. If a quorom of the Third Orders vote (say at least 1/8), and all agree, it passes. It is unlikely that the Council will ever return, because the prin- ciple of grove independence is too strongly established and at least half of the Third Orders are without current addresses on record. It also seems that it is unlikely that any vote could gain unanimity. Currently the Patriarchy of the Grannos, elected by the Council, is officially vacant; although Joan Carruth is currently overseeing its operation. The Coalition Council of Dalon ap Landu New Introduction By 1981, it appeared that Carleton had gone defunct, which it had from 1980-82 (and it was not doing to well 1983-85). The origi- nal Council of Dalon ap Landu had already proven to be a mori- bund institution for passing new legislation. The job of the Provi- sional Council of ArchDruids was essentially being done by The Druid Chronicler & Pentalpha magazine. Joan Carruth and Stephen Abbot were ArchDruids of the Berkeley grove during Isaac’s sabattical from 1979 to late 1981 (when the Death March on the Beach occured). With the original RDNA seemingly determined not to pass new legislation, a number of NRDNA groves decided to form their own legislative body, called the Coalition Concil of Dalon ap Landu (CoCoDAL). Their legislation would only affect those groves involved (primarily the Mother Grove of Berkeley, Live Oak Grove of Berke- ley, Greenwood Grove of Seattle and the San Diego Grove). By late 1982, during the final phase of the Druid Diaspora marked by Isaac’s short return & leaving to form ADF, it appears that the CoCoDAL was finished with its work and quietly faded away. I suspect that the leaders of CoCoDAL were just plain burnt out. It is uncertain whether the current NRDNA groves still follow these rules. -Scharding The Initial Letter To all ArchDruids & Solitary Thirds FULL POOP ON THE HIGHER ORDERS The Higher Orders were originally started at Carleton. I believe they got as high as Belenos [incorrect, they got up to Sirona ], before the original Carleton impetus petered out. After that, two main prob- lems arose. One was that Patriarchs (there were no Matriarchs) were not permitted to resign, though they dropped out and ceased func- tioning as M/Patriarchs, so no new members could be Ordained. Problem #2 was that ALL Members of the Counicl had to vote on an issue before the council, and at some point, less than half of the Council could be reached, or would respond to a vote. Groups struggled on, castrated, unable to stay in touch, crippled by unchange- able rules, and with no access to Higher Orders. What we have to do is start it again for ourselves. I propose retain- ing almost all of the original flavor: Third Orders only, given for achievement, not tenure; no special staus outside themselves; not prerequisite in nature (you need not be 4th Order to join the 5th); Council of Nth Order elects first M/P of N+1 Order, etc. I propose that we declare this Reform as a coalition of Groves and solitary 3rds, since we cannot speak for all Reformed Druids, within the old framework, and that these rules and suggestions are therefore only applicable to Members of the Coalition. We will institute this Coali- tion on Autumn Equinox, 19 YR 1981 ce, with those Groves and Solitarys who respond to join by that date. Please vote on the follow- ing Reforms, in this format: Reform #1 for: Kerry P (full last name) against: Paul M Also, give your responses to the Suggestions. Please send you re- sponses to Chris Sherbak, 2345 Post St #21, San Francisco CA 94115. We don’t want to set up a series of Bosses, or interfere with your Grove’s autonomy. I’m not trying to ego-trip, or ask a whole lot of time or effort from people. “Drawing Down the Moon” has initiated a flood of interest, and it would be nice to see these organizational blocks cleared up so we could expereience an expansion. I hope as many Groves & Solitaries as possible become part of this."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"164 PLEASE RESPOND Yours in the Mother Joan Carruth, DAL ArchDruid, Berkeley Grove NRDNA Matriarch , Order of Diancecht Issues for Voting by Coalition Council Issues for Voting by Coalition Council Issues for Voting by Coalition Council Issues for Voting by Coalition Council Issues for Voting by Coalition Council 1. PROPOSITIONS BEFORE THE ORDER OF DALON AP LANDU (and the Higher Orders) WILL BE CONSID- ERED TO COME OUT ON A MAJOR HIGH DAY (Sum- mer or Winter) (propositions to be in the mail to all members of the Coalition CoDAL no later than said High Day) AND ARE TO BE PASSED BY 2/3 OF ALL THIRD ORDERS WHOSE REPLIES ARE RECIEVED BY THE NEXT MA- JOR HIGH DAY (approximately 90 days), In essence we are saying that a Member may vote “for, “against”, or “no vote”, and issues will be decided by those who have an active vote. 2. THIS REFORM (which will permit both CoDAL business , and the restarting of the Higher Orders) SHALL BE INSTI- TUTED BY A COALITION OF GROVES AND SOLITARY THIRDS (originally those who choose to join by Autumn Equinox, 19YR). ANY GROVE THAT WISHES TO JOIN THE COALITION MAY DO SO BY 2/3 VOTE OF ITS THIRD ORDER MEMBERS, DURING THE SUMMER. ANY GROVE WISHING TO RESIGN FROM THE COA- LITION MAY DO SO BY THE SAME METHOD. IN THE WINTER. 3. M/PS OF HIGHER (or special) ORDERS MAY RESIGN OR OTHERWISE BE REPLACED WHEN NECESSARY (as by illness or death) BY THIS PROCESS: IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE OLD M/P SUGGESTS A REPLACE- MENT, WHO IS THEN CONFIRMED BY 2/3 OF THE COUNCIL OF THAT ORDER BY 90 DAY ACTIVE VOTE PROCEDURE. IF THIS IS NOT DONE, OR NOT CONFIRMED, M/P OF N-1 ORDER (ie, the Order below the one in Question) SHALL ACCEPT NOMINATIONS (90 days) OF AND BY MEMBERS OF N ORDER (not for oneself) AND COUN- CIL OF N-1 ORDER WILL ELECT NEW M/P FROM AMONG THESE CANDIDATES. 4. WITH THE M/PS APPROVAL, ANY MEMBER OF THE ORDER, OR THE CANDIDATE’S ARCHDRUID (who shall then wear the emblem of that Order, whether a member or not - this follows from the RDNA custom that a Third may consecrate emergency Waters of Life in the Winter, but must then wear the red ribbon) MAY PERFORM THE ORDINA- TION OF A NEW MEMBER. This will permit there to be an active, functioning Order in every Grove. In Groves in which the M/P of the Order does not reside, Order members will elect (during the fall) one of their members to be Head of N Order for that Grove for the next year. This person will be in contact with the M/P, organize meetings of the Order, etc. 5. A PERSON MAY BE A MEMBER OF MORE THAN ONE ORDER. A PERSON MAY BE M/P OF AN ORDER, AND OFFICER OF A GROVE. A PERSON MAY NOT BE M/P OF MORE THAN ONE ORDER. 6. ORDINATIONS FOR ANY ORDER SHALL BE DONE IN THE SUMMER, EXCEPT IN EMERGENCIES. RE- SIGNING M/P SHOULD DO SO IN SUMMER, BUT IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, INVESTITURE OF NEW M/P SHALL BE CONSIDERED EMERGENCY BUSINESS. M/ P REPORTS RESIGNATION TO M/P OF NEXT LOWER ORDER, AND THIS DOCUMENT BECOMES PART OF THE RECORDS OF THAT ORDER, AND SHOULD BE RETAINED. Old M/P should be sure to get Order Records to the new M/P, or to the M/P of N-1 Order, who will pass them along to the new M/P. 7. CHILDREN UNDER PUBERTY MAY NOT HOLD HIGHER THAN FIRST ORDER (and must, to be Members of Angus). NO ONE UNDER 18 SHALL HOLD THE THIRD ORDER, HENCEFORTH. Sorry, I don’t feel there’s any reason to rush such a step. If you’re interested at 16, you’ll be interested at 18, or you shouldn’t have been Or- dained. Also, all the original Carleton members were 18 or older. OTHER ITEMS TO VOTE ON: A: I (solitary) OR WE (Grove) CHOOSE TO JOIN THE PROPOSED COALITION. B: JOAN CARRUTH (currently Matriarch of Dain Cecht, a Special healing Order) IS CONFIRMED AS MATRIARCH OF GRANNOS. Council of Grannos will be formed by Reordination of members of DainCecht, and this Council will elect the M/P of Brachiaca . Third Order Members please vote for, against, no vote on issues and mail by Autumn Equinox. AD of Grove (or Preceptor) should record and send votes for all thirds in grove rather than grove thirds each mailing a resonse to Chris (this enables us to see what the grove activity as a whole is). Set up as shown on first page, on a sheet of paper. Date it, sign it, say what officer of what grove you are, and mail it to Chris.

Children under puberty shall not hold higher than 1st Order; no one under 18 shall be Ordained Third. Other Business Passed: A) Joan Carruth shall be the Matriarch of Grannos. Live Oak Grove volunteered to be Clearinghouse for 20 YR. Any Third Order member of the Coalition may originate a vote by send- ing a copy of the proposal to all member Groves or Solitaries, and to the Preceptor of the Clearinghouse Grove. Responses should be sent to the Clearinghouse, who will count them and report the results in the next Chronicler. The rulings of the CoCoDAL are binding only to members of the Coalition. These rules are meant in no way to inhibit the autonomy of any member Grove or solitary Third, but to facilitate the function- ing of the Reformed Druid Movement, and make the Higher Orders available once more. Each Third Order Coalition member has one vote in the CoCoDAL, whether solitary or a member of a Grove, though Grove Thirds should vote through their Preceptor or AD, so Emmon will not get confused as to who’s voted. If he gets the re- sponses from all the Thirds in a member Grove at once, it’ll simplify his counting. Unofficial Introduction to ADF By-Laws Ar nDraoicht Fein (ADF) is not not not not not officially related in any way to the Reform. However, because it was founded by Isaac Bonewits, not long after his attempts at Reforming the NRDNA, it may provide some idea of the type of national organization that Isaac was dream- ing of during the Isaac debates of the 1970s. By analyzing the ADF, you might better understand the experimentations of the SDNA from 1974-79, which in retrospect looks like the training grounds for what would be ADF in 1983. It should be remembered that ADF was not just Isaac’s project, but the work of many individuals.

They will not receive separate mailings of most A.D.F. publications. 3) “Lifetime” members are those individuals making large donations of money or service to A.D.F., as shall be determined by the Mother Grove. They are entitled to receive all A.D.F. publi- cations meant for the general membership, and shall be con- sidered current with their dues for the rest of their lives. 4) “Prisoner” members are those individuals currently incarcerated in correctional institutions, who may pay a lesser amount than the regular dues. They are entitled to receive all A.D.F. publications meant for the general membership, except that the Membership Directory and other publications which the Mother Grove may decide constitute a violation of privacy or risk for the general membership if examined within the prison system shall be withheld. Prisoners may not run for office, except within a local prison-based grove. 5) “Exchange Editor” members are those individuals, annually pay- ing a lesser amount than regular dues, who publish periodi- cals with which A.D.F. has an exchange subscription ar- rangement. Like family members, they will not receive sepa- rate mailings of most A.D.F. publications. 6) “Complimentary” members are those individuals whom the Mother Grove has decided should receive mailings of the general A.D.F. publications in order to keep them informed of our activities, and who pay no dues at all. They may not be vot- ing members and may not run for office. 7) From time to time the Mother Grove may institute other catego- ries of membership, including combinations of categories, and shall define their characteristics as needed. 8) Children under the age of l8 must have the signed and notarized permission of at least one parent or legal guardian in order to become a member of A.D.F., unless the Mother Grove shall rule otherwise. ADF Article 5: The Voting Members ADF Article 5: The Voting Members ADF Article 5: The Voting Members ADF Article 5: The Voting Members ADF Article 5: The Voting Members 1) “Voting” members, also known as the “members of record,” are those members of A.D.F. who: (a) belong to one of the dues- paying categories listed in the preceding sections of this ar- ticle; (b) are up to date with their A.D.F. membership dues; and (c) have not resigned from A.D.F., nor been expelled. 2) Each voting member shall have one vote, plus one additional vote for each full, continuous year that he or she remains a vot- ing member. 3) A gap of more than three months from the expiration of member- ship to renewal shall constitute a discontinuity of member- ship and cause the loss of all accumulated votes and related privileges. Any discontinued member may petition the Mother Grove for a reinstatement of their initial member- ship date and thus the recovery of accumulated votes and privileges, upon payment of dues in arrears. If the member- ship gap be three years or less in length, the Registrar shall grant such petitions under most circumstances. If the gap be longer than three years, or if the former member claims an inability to pay said arrears, or for any unusual conditions concerning the petitioner, the Registrar shall present the petition at the next Mother Grove meeting. The Mother Grove may then decide whether or not to reinstate the lapsed member’s initial membership date. 4) Except as may be noted elsewhere in these by-laws, all references to voting by the voting members assume these multiple votes. 5) Except as otherwise mentioned in these by-laws, a quorum for voting purposes shall consist of those voting members rep- resenting twenty-five percent of the total number of votes available to be cast. 6) Proxy votes may be assigned to voting members who are to be"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"167 present at an annual or special meeting, through the signing of the proxy statements issued by the Mother Grove, and are valid only for the annual or special meeting marked thereon. 7) If election or referendum choices are combined with a proxy state- ment, the person receiving the proxy must cast those votes given him or her according to any electoral choices marked on the combined ballot/proxy statement. If a given member sending in such a proxy has not made any such electoral choices, the person receiving the proxy may cast those votes according to his or her best judgment. 8) Voting members may attend annual or special meetings via elec- tronic communications devices if such are available.

All such study programs shall be grounded in the attainment and maintenance of demonstrable knowl- edge and skills. 2) Since it is envisioned that clergy and other leaders in A.D.F. will be only a fraction of the total membership, no pressure is to be placed on members to participate in any of the Druidic study programs."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"171 3) Any person claiming a rank related to a Druidic study program may be politely challenged to demonstrate his or her knowl- edge and/or skills, either by one or more examiners from the Council of Lore, or by any member of A.D.F. being asked to extend rights or privileges to said person based on his or her claimed rank.

It is in the format normally used in student organizational char- ters at Carleton. The Jan 27, 1965 vote requires official groves to have a constitution, but doesn’t say what to put in them. —Scharding We, the Reformed Druids of North America at Carleton College, in order to make our existence more fruitful, do hereby enact this, our Constitution. ARTICLE I The name of this organization shall be the Reformed Druids of North America at Carleton College. ARTICLE II Any student at Carleton College may become a member of this orga- nization upon presenting a petition, which may be oral, stat- ing that he believes in the basic tenets of North American Reformed Druidism as set forth in this Constitution. ARTICLE III The basic tenets of North American Reformed Druidism are these: 1) North American Reformed Druids believe that one of the many ways in which the object of man’s search for religious truth can be found is through Nature, the Earth-Mother. 2) North American Reformed Druids believe that Nature, being one of the primary concerns in man’s life and struggle, and being one of the Objects of Creation, is important to man’s spiritual quests. ARTICLE IV There shall be three officers of the Reformed Druids of North America: 1) The Arch-Druid must be at least a third-order North American Reformed priest. He [ or she ] shall preside over all meetings. 2) The Preceptor must be at least a second-order North American Reformed Druid, shall assist in services, and shall be the prin- cipal officer in the secular arm of the Reformed Druids of North America. 3) The Server must be at least a first-order North American Reformed Druid, and shall assist in services. ARTICLE V Elections for the posts of Arch-Druid, Preceptor, and Server shall be held annually, in May. Unless a member objects, the posts will be filled by a voice vote, with nominations being accepted from the floor of the meeting. Only those qualified to hold the posts may be nominated for any post. ARTICLE VI This Constitution may be attended by a majority vote in two con- secutive meetings of the Reformed Druids of North America. A quorum, which shall be one-eighth of those members known to the officers, must be present at both meetings. I certify this to be a true and accurate copy of the Constitution of the Reformed Druids of North America at Carleton College, read and approved at two consecutive meetings by all members present. -David Fisher The SDNA Constitution Here is a generic Grove constitution, as envisaged by Isaac Bonewits for future groves in the SDNA & HDNA (and possibly in some NRDNA groves). It is uncertain whether any grove be- sides the Hasidic Druid of North America and the Twin Cities Grove ever adopted this constitutional format. As you can tell, it is more complex and explicit about it’s terminology than the Generic Carleton constitution. —Scharding CONSTITUTION OF THE __________ GROVE OF THE ______________ DRUIDS OF NORTH AMERICA We, the __________ Druids of North America, living in the vicinity of _____________________________, in order to make our existence more fruitful, do hereby enact this, our Constitution.

Some merely ob- served a ritual in progress and joined in, but other were recruited by reading a flyer about Reformed Druidism. One can tell a great deal about a grove by the information in the flyers that it distributes to the general public. A flyer often tries to express the spirit of a grove’s Druidism in its simplest and most understandable format. I have presented three flyers here for your perusal. The first was made by Fisher and Frangquist for distributing at Carleton’s student activity fair, and it proved to be the foundational template for later flyers at Carleton and beyond. The second flyer was originally used as an introduction to the Druid Chronicles (Evolved) by Isaac Bonewits, and later as a hand-out by several groves on the west coast. The third flyer was made by Michael Scharding to hand out in his missionary grove at St.Cloud. Carleton tended to use a variant of the first flyer up to 1995, although a variant of the second one appeared once or twice. Both the second and third flyers were made for distribution in regions were Reformed Druidism was new and unheard of. Note Note Note Note Note: None of these flyers contain dogmatic organizational prin- ciples, but provide a basic idea of how the groups historically oper- ated. Their ideas are not set in stone. -Scharding What is Reformed Druidism? Reformed Druids of North America Flyer for Fall 1965 at Carleton Origins Origins Origins Origins Origins Reformed Druidism has its beginning at Carleton College in the spring of 1963 as a protest to the college’s requirement that all stu- dents attend a certain number of religious services or meetings. One of the ways of fulfilling the requirement was by attending services of one’s own religion. The Reformed Druids of North America pro- posed to test the degree of freedom permitted under this clause. Druidism was ideal for this attack. It had a perfect combination of exotic ritual plus some relevance to the so-called Judeo-Christian tra- dition. If religious credit were granted, the religious requirement could be exposed as totally ineffective. If, on the other hand, credit were denied, the college could be charged with bigotry. The initial attitude of the college was, “If we ignore them, they’ll go away.”. But the RDNA not only refused to go away, it grew, acquiring an advisor, and becoming a registered college organization. In June, 1964, the religious requirement was repealed. Even though the Druids rejoiced at this triumph, they recognized that their job was not over. For many members the movement had come to repre- sent a valuable part of their spiritual lives. So there was the impor- tance of continuing the RDNA as a protest against all coerced reli- gion. Principles Principles Principles Principles Principles Druidism boasts its lack of institutionalized dogma. Each Druid is required only to adopt these Basic Tenets: (1) One of the many ways in which the object of Man’s search for religious truth can be found is through Nature: the Earth-Mother. (2) Nature, being one of the primary concerns in Man’s life and struggle, and being one of the objects of creation, is important to Man’s spiritual quests. (The phrase “objects of creation” does not necessarily imply a single Creator, but it does imply an important link between the spiritual and the material realms) In Reformed Druidism, the material realm, Nature, is personified as the Earth-Mother. The abstract essence of the universe, in opposi- tion to the material world, is referred to as Be’al, from a word which the ancient Celts applied to an abstract supreme being. The “object of Man’s search” is called “awareness,” and it is defined as “unity with Be’al”. Ritual Ritual Ritual Ritual Ritual In accord with the Basic Tenets, all Reformed Druid worship must be directed toward Nature. For this reason, many customs and ritu- als of the Ancient Druids, who were essentially Nature-worshippers, are retained. Druid worship must, in so far as possible, be held in the out-of- doors; an oak grove, or a hill or other prominence, is ideal. Accord- ing to ancient Druid custom, the officiating Druids, and others who so wish, ought to be clad in long white robes; the robe of the Arch- Druid having a distinctive decoration or color. The waters-of-life are usually passed to all present as a symbol of the link man has with Nature. Incantation and other ancient Celtic ritual is also used; but in “Reformed” Druidism, human sacrifice is out. In order to focus attention on Nature, various aspects of it retain the names of their corresponding Celtic gods and goddesses.

Celebration always begins at sundown the previous evening, and includes bonfires and revelry appropriate to the season. Samhain - Nov. 1: “Halloween” begins the period of Geimredh. Midwinter - the winter solstice; day of the “Yule log” Oimelc - Feb. 1; begins the period of Earrach. Beltane- May 1; “May Day,” begins period of Samradh. Midsummer - the summer solstice Lugnasadh (Brón Troghain) - Aug. 1; day for gatherings and feasts, begins the period of Foghamhar. The phases of the moon also ought to be followed closely. A new venture should be begun only when the moon is waxing, an old one consummated only when it is waning. The night of the full moon is a time of rejoicing; while the night of the new moon is a solemn occasion, calling for vigils and meditation. Organization Organization Organization Organization Organization Each organization (known as a grove) has three officers: an Arch- Druid, who must be a third order priest or higher, to direct worship; a Preceptor, who must be at least a second order Druid, to handle business matters; and a Server, to assist the Arch-Druid. To become a first order Druid, a person must partake of the wa- ters-of-life, and affirm his acceptance of the Basic Tenets (listed un- der Principles above). To become a second order Druid, one must pledge himself to the service of Druidism, as well as have an understanding of basic Dru- idism. To become a third order priest, one must dedicate himself to a life of Druidic inquiry, the beginning of which is an all-night, outdoor vigil. Higher orders of the priesthood (up to the tenth) are reserved for outstanding insight and dedication over a period of time. They are similar to academic degrees in that they represent personal achieve- ment, but carry no special authority. Each order of the priesthood is dedicated to one of the eight aspects of Nature mentioned under Ritual. Purpose Purpose Purpose Purpose Purpose On a superficial level, it might now seem that the purpose of Reformed Druidism is merely to delve into the strange customs and rituals of the ancient Celts, and to have some fun doing it, and also to serve as a new and different type of protest movement. But, on deeper examination of the RDNA, it might be said to have two important purposes: (1) It offers a reasonable alternative for the person who cannot stomach organized religion, or who feels that it is somehow deficient; and it hopes that its exotic forms of worship will appeal to the rebel. (2) In communing with Nature, it seeks to promote a spirit of meditation and introspection, aimed ultimately at awareness of religious truth. What and Why is Reformed Druidism in the 70s? Schismatic Druids of North America Introduction for The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) Fall 1976 Origins Origins Origins Origins Origins Many people coming across the Reformed Druid movements for the first time may very well be confused as to their exact nature, and for good reason - Reformed Druidism is very con- fusing, even (or perhaps especially) to its members. There- fore, this introduction may help to place certain concepts into perspective. Reformed Druidism (or, at least, the first known Branch of the Reform) was started as a lark at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota in the Spring of 1963 c.e. (common era) as a protest to the college’s requirement that all students attend a certain number of religious services or meetings per semester. One of the ways in which this requirement could be fulfilled was by attending the services of one’s own religion. The original Reformed Druids of North America (“RDNA”) was founded in order to test the amount of freedom granted under this clause - by inventing a new and unheard of religion on the spot. As originally founded, Reformed Druidism was ideal for this attack. It had a perfect combination of “exotic ritual” plus “some relevance to the so-called Judeo-Christian Tradition.” If religious attendance credit had been given then the require- ment would have been shown up as totally ineffective. If, in- stead, credit had been denied, then the college could have been charged with creedism. The initial attitude of the college administrators was “If we ignore them, they’ll go away.” But the RDNA not only did not go away, it grew, acquired a faculty advisor and became a registered student organization - one that has existed, off and on, to this very day. [ Never recognized, actually. -Scharding ] In June of 1964 c.e., the religious requirement was repealed. Even though the Druids rejoiced at this triumph, some of them realized that their job was not yet over. For many mem- bers, the movement had come to represent more than a prac- tical joke and an excuse to miss Sunday Chapel - It had come to represent a valuable part of their spiritual lives. And so, to the surprise of the original Founders, the RDNA continued to exist and grow; with graduates of Carleton College spread- ing the movement (and its offshoots) across the country. Basic Basic Basic Basic Basic Beliefs Beliefs Beliefs Beliefs Beliefs The principles of the original RDNA are quite simple and are referred to as the “Basic Tenets.” We quote here from The Book of the Law , Verses 4-6, as they appear in the Lughnasadh 14 y.r. Edition of The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) : “4. Now the Basic Tenets of Reformed Druidism are these: 5. The object of the search for religious truth, which is a uni- versal and a never-ending search, may be found through the Earth-Mother; which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 6. And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual impor-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"177 tance, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it do people live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face-to-face with it.” This has since been abbreviated, in The Outline of the Foun- dation of the Fundamentals , to the following statements: “1. Nature is good! And the second is like unto the first: 2. Nature is good!” It appears that all Reformed Druids, of every Branch of the Reform, believe in the above principles, though all have their own interpretations of the words. In all the Branches of the Reform, the material realm, Nature, is personified as the Earth- Mother (one of the oldest archetypes known to humanity). The abstract essence of the universe(s), in distinction from the material world, is referred to as Be’al, from a word which the Ancient Celts applied to an abstract supreme being (based on the root “Bel”, meaning “good, shining, bright”). The “ob- ject of Humanity’s search” is called “awareness” and it is de- fined as “unity with Be’al”. The Branches of the Reform The Branches of the Reform The Branches of the Reform The Branches of the Reform The Branches of the Reform There are at present ( Lughnasadh 14 y.r.) several overlap- ping Branches of Reformed Druidism: the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA), the New Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA), the Schismatic Druids of North America (SDNA), the Hasidic Druids of North America (HDNA), and rumblings of a few others (including Zen Dru- idism, Chaoist Druidism, Norse Druidism, ect.) The RDNA is, of course, the original group and looks some- what askance at the offshoots. The NRDNA and the SDNA were founded during Foghamhar 12 y.r. (Fall of 1974 c.e.) and the HDNA during Samradh 14 y.r. (Summer of 1976 c.e.). The other offshoots are as yet twinkles in their Founders’ eyes. The RDNA itself neither categorically denies nor accepts the validity of any particular faith, including its own. This is one of the most important principles of the RDNA. It means that anyone may become this kind of Druid without feeling obligated to renounce her or his present religious beliefs and without being committed to anything but the Basic Tenets. Many find this approach to mysticism liberating, although some may also feel that it prevents them from answering the question, “Is my Druidism valid?” The answer to that ques- tion must be found on an individual level and a Druid would say “It will come with awareness.” While the original RDNA includes Jews, Christians, Ag- nostics, Atheists, Marxist and members of other faiths in its ranks, the NRDNA seems to include many Neopagans as well (for a discussion of what Neopaganism is see The First Epistle of Isaac, Part Two ) and one Grove at least is headed further and further in that direction. However, the major dis- tinctions between the NRDNA and the RDNA appears to be in their political structure rather than their philosophy (see below). The SDNA is emphatically Neopagan in its philosophy (al- though in an antidogmatic fashion) and defines itself as fol- lows: “The SDNA is a Branch of Reformed Druidism, em- phasizing its own nature as an Eclectic Reconstructionist Neopagan Priestcraft, based primarily upon Gaulish and Celtic sources, but open to ideas, deities and rituals from many other Neopagan belief systems. We worship the Earth-Mother as the feminine personification of Manifestation, Be’al as the masculine personification of Essence, and numerous Gods and Goddesses as personification of various aspects of our experience. We offer no dogmas or final answers but only continual questions. Our goal is increased awareness and har- mony within ourselves and all of Nature. We are willing to interact philosophically and ritual with members of all other belief systems, including all other Branches of the Reform, that are compatible with our own approach and Nature. We accept our duty to assist Evolution, on all levels, and to work for the survival of our Holy Mother the Earth.” The HDNA is the most recent Branch of the Reform, be- ing an offshoot from the SDNA. It too considers itself to be a form of Neopaganism and has chosen to orient itself around a total Neopagan Lifestyle, based upon “repaganized” patterns taken from Jewish origins. It is currently offering the follow- ing self-definition, until a better one is evolved: “The HDNA is a Branch of Reformed Druidism, emphasizing its own na- ture as an Eclectic Reconstructionist Neopagan Lifestyle, based primarily upon Gaulish, Celtic, Yiddish and Hebrew Paleopagan sources, but open to ideas, deities and rituals from many other Neopagan belief systems...” [the rest of their defi- nition follows that of the SDNA] It should be remembered that most of the members of the RDNA do not consider themselves to be Pagans of any sort, but rather followers of a way of inquiry that is applicable to any faith. Druids believe that among the many obstacles to spiritual growth are Dogmatism and Orthodoxy; the formal- ization of beliefs in a fashion that discourages continual spiri- tual inquiry, or that encourages others to adopt them without their own inquiry. Many also feel that most of the world’s religions are beset by these problems and must constantly combat their ossifying influence. The Neopagans agree that it is necessary to keep a wary eye and a keen sense of humor about the whole problem. Still, many of the older members of the RDNA disapprove of Neopagan Druidism, considering it a dangerous step backwards. The SDNA and the HDNA seem to place more of an em- phasis than the RDNA and the NRDNA (except for the Ber- keley Grove) upon the following areas; Magic, craft, Poetry, Song, Dance, use of Solar and Lunar cycles, Neopagan ecu- menical rites, civil liberties actions and active worship of many Gods not mentioned in the original RDNA literature. All Reformed Druid movements are interested in ecological ac- tivities and in the creation of new liturgies. There are many members of the NRDNA who agree with the philosophy of the SDNA and/or the HDNA, but who prefer to remain with the organizational structure of the RDNA. This is what we mean when we say that the Branches of the Reform “overlap”. Also of interest is the fact that, thanks to the Apostolic Succession from Carleton College (maintained by using the same basic ordination ceremony, with or without additions, for the Priesthood), all Third Order priests and priestesses of any Branch of the Reform are equally “legiti- mate”, though personal beliefs vary widely and some groups may not allow priests of a different Branch to lead some of their specialized rites. In none of the currently existing Branches of the Reform is"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"178 either sex given precedence over the other, nor any race, color, nationality or culture considered superior. The SDNA and the HDNA accept only Pagans for the Priesthood. The Priest- hood of the RDNA and the NRDNA, on the other hand, are open to members of all faiths. Local Organization Local Organization Local Organization Local Organization Local Organization All Branches of the Reform operate locally in “Groves”. Each Grove has at least three officers; an Archdruid/ess, who must be at least a Third Order Druid or Druidess, to direct worship; a Preceptor (or Preceptress) who must be of at least the Second Order, to handle business matters; and a Server, who must be of at least the First Order, to assist the Archdruid/ ess. In the SDNA and the HDNA, other officers are added, including an Assistant Archdruid/ess, to preside over services when the regular Archdruid/ess is absent, and a Bard, to di- rect all the music, poetry, singing and dancing. Some Groves may also appoint an Astrologer to select the proper dates for services, etc. To become a First Order Druid/ess, a person must partake of the waters-of-life and affirm her or his acceptance of the Basic Tenets. To become a Second Order Druid/ess, one must pledge himself or herself to the service of Druidism, as well as have an understanding of basic Reformed Druidism. To become a Third Order Druid/ess (priest or priestess), one must dedicate herself or himself to a life of Druidic in- quiry, the beginning of which is an all night fast and vigil in the outdoors. The SDNA and the HDNA add various other requirements for this Order, including, amongst others, (1) a statement to the members of the Grove that one does indeed think of oneself as a Pagan, (2) progress in the learning of magical , religious and parapsychological knowledge, (3) progress in the learning of various crafts and fine arts, and (4) an agreement between the candidate and the ordaining Archdruid/ess that a genuine vocation is evident. The normal time period in the SDNA and the HDNA from becoming a member of the First Order to being ordained to the Third Order (for those who are not already clergy in other Neopagan religions) is a year and a day. The RDNA and the NRDNA also encourage the ordina- tion only of those with vocations, however, they define this differently and do not necessarily consider holding of Neopagan priesthood as evidence of such. In order to establish a legal Grove, in any Branch, it is necessary to have three people, at least one of whom is of the Third Order and one of the Second, to adopt one of the stan- dard forms of a Constitution and (for the offshoots) to regis- ter the fact of the Grove’s existence with the head of one’s Branch. National Organization National Organization National Organization National Organization National Organization Each Grove, in every Branch of the Reform, is an indepen- dent entity, as is each Branch. In the RDNA, what little gover- nance occurs is handled by the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, which consists of all Third Order priests and priestesses, in- cluding (presumably) those who belong to the other Branches. (It would be difficult legally and ethically oust the “heretics”, in any event, since they do hold legitimate Apostolic Succes- sion and there are not provisions -currently- for loyalty oaths to the original Branch.) The basic principal of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu has been described by some as “that govern- ment is best which governs least.” The CoDAL operates by mail and is officially headed by whoever is Archdruid/ess of Carleton Grove. Since (a) Druids don’t write letters much, (b) the Carleton Grove is most active during the school year, and (c) it has also suffered organizational difficulties over the last few years (though it now seems healthy enough) the CoDAL has actually done very little over the years. The NRDNA formed, in part, over this difficulty and is in the process of reorganizing its political structure. Three of the five RDNA Groves (Berkeley, Chicago and Stanford) decided in August 1974 c.e. to stage a coup d’etat and form a Provi- sional Council of ArchDruids, inviting the leaders of all ac- tive Groves to join. Further details on this action, and the confusion accompanying it, can be found in The Book of Changes . The fifth Grove (the Twin Cities) began to schis from the RDNA at the same time. The reasons for the schism (whether full or partial, temporary or permanent, has never been de- cided) were dissatisfaction with the religious vaguenesses and overly anarchistic disorganization that they believed to exist in the original Druid organization, a desire to make their form of Druidism more available to the public, and a feeling that it was unfair to all parties involved to use the same name. It is currently headquartered in Berkeley California (The Mother Grove, which has an overlapping membership with the Ber- keley Grove, NRDNA). The HDNA was formed as an offshoot of the SDNA, with its full cooperation, and is currently headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri (the Arch Grove) The Archdruids of the NRDNA, SDNA and HDNA Groves belong to the Provisional Council of Archdruids (PCoADS), which is in correspondence with the RDNA Archdruids. However, the political structure of all these Branches will no doubt continue to evolve as time goes on. The SDNA has arranged for legal minister and church sta- tus to be granted to any Druid priest/ess or Grove so desiring (in any Branch) via a federally recognized Nonprofit Religious Association (the Association for the Advancement of Aquarian Age Awareness). Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders Within the RDNA there are “Higher Orders,” from the Fourth to the Tenth, that are “reserved for outstanding in- sight and dedication over a period of time. They are similar to academic degrees in that they represent personal achievement, but carry no special authority.” Each of these Higher Orders is dedicated to one of the aspects of Nature mentioned below (under “Ritual”). There are at present only four of these Or- ders operating (the Fourth through Seventh), since the Patri- arch of the Seventh Order resigned several years ago (as did the Patriarch of the Fourth Order more recently) and the RDNA has never instituted or executed any procedures for selecting replacements for the heads of the Higher Orders. Since the heads (Patriarchs and Matriarchs) of each Higher Orders are elected by the members of each Order directly"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"179 below, this means that the Eight, Ninth and Tenth Orders have no leaders and no members. There are also other Orders associated with the other Branches of the Reform, including the Order of Oberon and the Order of Merddyn in the SDNA (which are Bardic and Ceremonial Magical Orders, respectively), the Order of Diancecht in the NRDNA ( a Healing Order), etc. As a gen- eral rule, these Orders have only whatever “authority” in a local Grove may choose to grant them. For example, in the Twin Cities Grove, the Order of Oberon is headed by the Grove’s Bard and is in charge of all music, poetry, ritual dra- mas, etc. The Matriarch or Patriarch of each special Order is usually self-appointed and exercises whatever internal author- ity they can get away with, which isn’t much. Ritual Ritual Ritual Ritual Ritual In accordance with the Basic Tenets, all Reformed Druid worship is directed towards Nature. For this reason, many customs and rituals (real, reconstructed, or fancied) of the Ancient (Paleopagan) Druids are retained. The Berkeley Grove seems to have done the most research in this area so far, having a gigantic library of Celtic materials and holding many of its services in Gaelic. Druid worship should in so far as is possible, be held in the out-of-doors. An oak grove, beach, hill or other place of natural beauty is ideal. During the winter, especially in the Northern parts of the country, frequent outdoor services are impractical. The Berke- ley Grove solves this by having “Celtic Nights” every other week during the winter, and the Twin Cities Grove has ex- perimented with weekly Taoist meditation services, which seemed to fit quite well with the Reformed druid idea. According to custom, the officiating Third Order Druids, and other who so wish, ought to be clad in long robes (white is traditional, but any color other than black is acceptable), with the robe of the presiding Archdruid/ess having a distinc- tive color or decoration. The official mark of the Priesthood is the red or white ribbon (depending on the season) worn around the neck. This is the actual minimum of vestments and some Groves may choose to wear ordinary clothes or dress in some other manner. Ribbons of other colors are worn as insignia by the various Orders as well. The waters-of-life are usually passed to all present as a sym- bol of the link we have with Nature. Incantation and other Paleopagan ritual devices are also used, but in all Branches of the Reform human and animal sacrifice is forbidden (actually there is very little to support the idea that human sacrifice was ever very common among the Ancient Druids anyway). The sacrifice that is used instead is usually the leaves and branches of a living plant (often, but not always, an oak tree). In order to focus attention on Nature, various aspects of Her retain the names of their corresponding Celtic and Gaulish Gods and Goddesses: Dalon Ap Landu, Lord of the Groves Grannos, God of Healing Springs Braciaca, God of Malt and Brewing Belenos, God of the Sun Sirona, Goddess of Rivers Taranis, God of Thunder and Lightning Llyr, God of the Sea Danu, Goddess of Fertility These deities are referred to by all Branches of the Reform, though their relative importance varies from Grove to Grove. In the HDNA, SDNA, and some parts of the NRDNA, sev- eral other deities are added. For details concerning these and other deities, see Miscellaneous Customs and Liturgical Notes , The Book of Footnotes , A Guide to Gaelic Deities and the appro- priate books in A Bibliography of Druidism . There are two standard services for weekly use, called the “Orders of Common Worship,” one for the Summer half of the year and one for the Winter half. There are also “Special Orders of the Worship” for the High Days (see below), most of them written by the Berkeley Grove, and all of them op- tional. Many other ceremonies, some required and some op- tional, have been created over the years and more are still being invented. For copies of these rituals, see The Liturgy of the Druids . Festivals and Holy Days Festivals and Holy Days Festivals and Holy Days Festivals and Holy Days Festivals and Holy Days The Druid festivals that are held in common by most Branches correspond to the important dates of the old Celtic year. Cel- ebration always begins at sundown of the previous evening and includes bonfires and revelry appropriate to the season. The High Days are divided into Major and Minor ones: Samhain occurs around November 1st, is a Major High Day and begins the period of Geimredh . Midwinter occurs around December 21st, is a Minor High Day and marks the Winter Solstice. Oimelc occurs around February 1st, is a Major High Day and begins the period of Earrach . Spring occurs around March 21st, is a Minor High Day, the Vernal equinox is not celebrated by the RDNA. Beltane occurs around May 1st, is a Major High Day and begins the period of Samradh . Midsummer occurs around June 21st, is a Minor High Day and marks the Summer Solstice. Lughnasadh occurs around August 1st, is a Major High Day and begins the period of Foghamhar . Fall or Autumn occurs around September 21st, is a Minor High Day, the Autumnal Equinox is not celebrated in the RDNA. These dates are all calculated in different ways by different Groves, and are extremely flexible in any event. The phases of the moon are closely watched and attempt is made to begin projects when the moon is waxing and to end them when it is waning. The night of the full moon is a night of rejoicing, while many Druids use the night of the new moon for solemn vigils and fasting. There are numerous other holidays and festivals, especially in the SDNA and the HDNA, kept by individual Druids and Groves. For more information about these matters, see The Tally of the Years and the Druid Calendars . Sacred Scriptures Sacred Scriptures Sacred Scriptures Sacred Scriptures Sacred Scriptures"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"180 There are a number of collected writings held in greater or lesser reverence by various Druids. The Chronicles of the Foun- dation , originally entitled The Druid Chronicles (Reformed ), are the only writings universally held to be of “sacred” status. The Books of the Apocrypha consist of a variety of letters sent out by members of the Priesthood to each other. The Liturgy of the Druids is a collection of rites performed by both large and small numbers of Druids. Further Laws, Customs and Ordi- nances is the title for several pieces of constitutional and legis- lative material, as well as articles on the calendrical systems and miscellaneous customs developed by various individual Druids and Groves. The Great Druish Books are those held to by the Hasidic Druids (and a very few others ). The Druid Mis- cellany is a number of short articles concerning matters his- torical, linguistic, polytheological, Bardic and bibliographical. All of these items will be found in The Druid Chronicles (Evolved ) which is currently selling at a price (cost) of $6.00 per copy. The Green Book is a collection of favorite meditational pas- sages and poems used by the Carleton Grove. It should be available later in 1976 c.e., from the Ann Arbor Grove. The Black Book is the name for the Carleton Archdruids’ copy of the liturgy. Conclusion Conclusion Conclusion Conclusion Conclusion We hope that this brief Introduction has answered some of your more important questions about the different organiza- tions called themselves part of the Reformed Druid move- ments. Obviously , only a thorough and careful reading of all of the literature of the various Branches will acquaint you com- pletely with each one. Naturally each Branch of the Reform likes itself the best and wishes to be distinguished from the others (especially the RDNA, which wishes to be kept com- pletely distinct from its offshoots). It is up to the reader to decide which, if any, of the Reformed Druid movements strikes a responsive chord. Further information about Druidism of your choice can be obtained by writing to the nearest Grove of the Branch that you are interested in.

They also have a reverence for the importance of the Earth in our daily lives. We join together to enrich eachother by sharing insights and point- ing out good resources. This is our first year at SCSU. Common Beliefs: Common Beliefs: Common Beliefs: Common Beliefs: Common Beliefs: There are only two Basic Tenets which we, as a group, agree with: 1) The object of the search for religious truth, which is a universal and a never-ending search, may be found through the Earth-Mother; which is Nature; but this is one way, yea, one way among many. 2) And great is the importance, which is of a spiritual importance, of Nature, which is the Earth-Mother; for it is one of the objects of Creation, and with it do people live, yea, even as they do struggle through life are they come face-to-face with it. Everything beyond that is up to you, as far as we are con- cerned. We don’t like dogma. History History History History History The first grove of the Reformed Druids was founded at Carleton College in Northfield Minnesota in 1963. Some students wanted to protest mandatory chapel attendance, and they learned of a loophole allowing students to alternatively attend services of their own religion. They decided to make up their “own religion” and created the Reformed Druids as a hoax, based on the image of the ancient Druids of France & Britain. When the chapel requirement was dropped by the college, they found that they were enjoy- ing the Druidical activities too much to quit. Many had found that the eternal search for religious truth was too important to abandon and that Druidism was the vehicle for that search. As they graduated from Carleton, many Druids founded new Druid groups, called “groves” and continued to help other students explore their own be- liefs. Structure Structure Structure Structure Structure Being a creation of the 1960s, Reformed Druidism doesn’t really like hierarchy. However, three basic officers of the group are necessary to maintain club status and to make sure activities DO happen. We elect them every year in the first three weeks of Fall term. 1) Arch-Druid. This is the titular head of the grove. She or he is responsible for organizing activities and lead- ing seasonal services. 2) Preceptor. The right-hand Druid of the Arch-Druid. She or he helps the Arch-Druid with organizing events and they play a role in the services. 3) Server. The server merely is a go-for to help with ad- vertising and various tasks. Although all members are equal in the eyes of the group, some members will occasionally pass through different stages of spiritual growth. It is customary to mark these events by holding a ceremony in their honor. We call these ceremonies “orders”, similar to the different levels of Masonic groups.. There are traditional speeches and activities associated with the three different orders. They are serene and dignified events and they are often designed & directed by the initiate. Most people don’t go through the orders, and that’s fine. But there is much more to Druidism that collecting silly titles. The Festivals The Festivals The Festivals The Festivals The Festivals Because we find one type of inspiration through Nature’s cycles, we hold periodic ceremonies to honor the passing of the seasons. The names are taken from public holidays in Ireland that were similarly practiced in most of Europe up until W.W.II. Each of these four holidays is usually ac- companied by a campfire. Samhain Samhain Samhain Samhain Samhain (Pron. “Sa-veen” or “Sawin”) Nov. 1st. Known in Christian calendars today as “All Saints Day” Remembrance of our ancestors and honoring the beginning of the Winter half of the Druidical year. Imbolc Imbolc Imbolc Imbolc Imbolc (Pron. “Eem-bolluck” or “im-wolac”) Feb 1st. Known in Christian calendars as “Candlemass”. At this time of the year, the first signs of spring are revealed through pussywillows, ewes bearing lambs and a slow warming of temperatures. Beltane Beltane Beltane Beltane Beltane (Pron. “Bell-tain” or “Bel-tin-uh”) May 1st. Known to many as “May Day”. It is the celebration of the fertility in the Earth and the beginning of the Summer half of the Druidical year. May-pole dances and flower-gathering are common activities. Lughnasadh Lughnasadh Lughnasadh Lughnasadh Lughnasadh (Pron. “Loo-na-sa”) Aug. 1st. This is a har- vest festival, celebrating the pinnacle of the Earth’s productive bounty and the realization that winter is slowly coming and that we must prepare for upcom- ing hardships. Part Two: Frequently Asked Questions Part Two: Frequently Asked Questions Part Two: Frequently Asked Questions Part Two: Frequently Asked Questions Part Two: Frequently Asked Questions Q: What is Reformed Druidism? A: Reformed Druidism is that feeling when you see a little bird hatching from an egg in the spring. It is a deep personal drive for religious truth, a drive so important that you will follow it no matter where it takes you. It is a journey, perhaps with occasional wayside rests, but still a journey whose only distant destination is truth. Q: Do Reformed Druids have scriptures? A: Not really. We are a living experience that cannot be en- compassed with pen & ink. We do have some reflective writings from past members, but most people ignore them as silly. Instead, most Druids seek inspiration from various philosophical and religious writings that they"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"182 BABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB find attractive. Some Druids find that events in their everyday lives provide plenty of inspiration No two Dru- ids have the same background of ideas, which makes our interactions all the more productive & unpredict- able. Q: What do Reformed Druids think about the Earth? A: Most of us agree that the Earth is good; so much so that we affectionately refer to her as the “Earth-mother”. Every- one today realizes that we have to be environmentally aware of the earth’s cycle and the Druids often go a step further. While many of us find spiritual fulfillment in the lofty aeries of theoretical theology, we also realize that the material world can also teach us spiritual les- sons. We can find truths in the eternal cycles of life and death and in the passing of the seasons. We recognize these lessons by marking the seasons with rituals to ex- press these lessons. Q: Do I have to abandon my previous religion to become a Druid? Do I have to be Pagan? A: We welcome people of all religions and philosophies to the group, provided they can interact respectfully and maturely. Reformed Druidism does not require (nor does it desire) that you change religion. It only asks you to examine your beliefs and expand your understanding of alternate systems. It is far better to be able to expand the understanding of one’s own religion than to wander aim- lessly, although for some members, such wandering may lead them to new religions or philosophies that they may find better suited to their life. Q: What kind of activities do Druids do? A: Most of the time it’s just talking together, sharing ideas and telling each other about good courses to take. Other times we may meet to quietly meditate or go for nature walks. Occasionally we get together for a service to mark the passing of the seasons and pause to reflect how simi- lar cycles of ebb and flow also occur in our daily lives. Some members prefer to do Druidical activities on their own with only the occasional interaction of the group. Many members drift away after they find that they don’t need the group anymore, others stay behind to help fu- ture members in their searches. Q: Are you guys a cult? I mean, do you do animal sacrifice or brainwashing? A: Nope, No and No. We’re a club for people looking for truths and who are willing to share their insights. We do offer up the occasional vegetable or oak-branch at our services, but then again the Christians often offer up bread and wine. Q: So what’s the point? A: “The Search is it’s own reward.” Time Line of Reformed Druidism 1963 1963 1963 1963 1963 First ritual of RDNA April, Basic Tenets April, Carleton Grove founded May, Hierarchy up to Third May First Beltane May Carleton Constitution June, First Samhain November Predictions come true November 1964 1964 1964 1964 1964 First Third Order ceremony, April Fisher resigns Archdruidcy, May CoDAL begins, May Nelson is ArchDruid, May Higher Orders 4th to 6th, May Chapel requirement gone, June First missionary groves, Summer Druid Chronicles (Reformed), Summer Vermilion SD, Summer Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan WI.

In later years, the circle has sometimes been drawn as a wreath with two staves in front of it. It has also been adopted by such second and third generation spin-off Druid organizations from the Reform as Ar nDriaocht Fein (ADF), The Henge of Keltria and the Primitive Celtic Church. This symbol was once thought to be an ancient Celtic symbol for the Earth-Mother. In the Reform at least, the Druid Sigil is used in blessings, and in signing of names by members of the Third Order. It is often mistakingly asserted that the Founders took it from an illustration (plate 2) in The Druids by Stuart Piggott, showing the floor plan of a Roman-Celtic temple of Nodens. However, this book was published after 1966, and the Druids were using the sigil since 1963, so it seems unlikely as a source. Larson still believes that the illustration may have been published somewhere else earlier. As a symbol, no one knows exactly what it means or where it came from (David Fisher has refused interviews since the 70s), but there are MANY interpretations. Druid Symbols used by Other Druid Groups Druid Symbols used by Other Druid Groups Druid Symbols used by Other Druid Groups Druid Symbols used by Other Druid Groups Druid Symbols used by Other Druid Groups Although not used by the RDNA, there are many other symbols used by other Druid organizations. One such symbol is the three rays of Awen: /l\\ . One possible explanation is that it represents the three drops of wisdom that fell from the Cauldron of Knowledge; the ones that landed on Taliesin’s tongue and made him a super- bard. Another explanation is that they represent the angles of the three different rays of light as they come through a hole in a stone at megalithic sites on the winter solstice, equinoxes and summer sol- stice. This symbol can be found used by the Henge of Keltria (within a Druid Sigil), the New Forest Center, Order of Bards Ovates and Druids, L’ecole Druidique des Gaules, L’eglise Druidique des Gaules and the Welsh Bards of the Gorsedd. Other generic symbols used by Druids are the oak leaf, the oak tree (or any tree), the acorn and the golden sickle. ADF uses a trunk of an oak tree that has been chopped down, yet with a sampling growing from the center of the supposedly dead trunk; and also with it’s roots wrapped into a Celtic knot. This badge was designed by Jim Odberts, with inspiration from the Clan MacEwen badge. The interlacing of the roots indicate the Pan-Indo-European “roots” of Druidism. “The French Druids of the Druidic Church of Gaul (L’eglise Druidique des Gaulois) use a circle transcribing a large “X” inside. Pierre de la Crau writes in “Druids Progress #5”; The symbol that we use is the labarum (a Latin word from the Celtic labaron; Welsh llafar, “ringing, eloquent,” Irish labar, “eloquent”). The source of the labarum is the Gaulish sign (X) symbolizing the flashing and domineering power of the Celtic god Taranis. This symbol was taken up by the Roman emperor Constantinus follow- ing a vision in the Grand’s sanctuary (France), when he saw “Apollo” with the goddess “Vicotry”, showing him three groups of three labari surrounded with crown laurels can be seen on a tombstone in the Lyon’s Museum (France). Constantinus used this sign as his stan- dard to lead his Gaulish armies to victory against Maxentius. After this victory, the Celtic Pagan symbol was coopted by the Christians and became the Constantnian “chrisme” or the Chi-Rho monogram for Christ.” Daniel Hansen in his article in Circle Magazine, mentions other Druidic magic symbols, such as the Sun Wheel (Rota Taranous) and the Celtic Cross, which are found throughout the Celtic countries. He also mentions that the circle represents mystery or eternity and the cube signifies truth. The Swastika (fulfot) and the Triskelion (Trifot) are symbols found throughout western Europe and Celtic countries. When spinning counter-clockwise many consider them destructive and war-like, but they are creative when spinning clockwise. He also claims that the Caduceus, used today in the medical profession, was associated with the Druids. The “Ovum Anguinum” or Adder Stone is a well known Druidic amulet, supposedly formed by twisting snakes. It is claimed to float upstream and can be used to win lawsuits. Kinds of Liturgy Kinds of Liturgy Kinds of Liturgy Kinds of Liturgy Kinds of Liturgy There are several types of liturgies performed in the different Re- formed Druid movements. Most common are the Orders of Common Worship for the Winter and Summer halves of the year (one each). These are the two types used for regular weekly services, which were common during the early years of the Reform. Now that these weekly services are rare to non-existent, their use is now often as generic rituals for use on non-festival occasions. Their format is not fixed in finality and adjustments or new creations are highly encouraged and recommended. Then there are the Special Orders of Worship for the High Days , one or more versions for each of the Four Major and Four Minor Days. These are entirely optional and vary from Grove to Grove. For more on the 8 festivals, see the Calendar Section further below. Most are vaguely based upon the Orders of Common Worship , with special ad- ditions to emphasize the unique elements of each festival. There are also Ordination Ceremonies for the First, Second, Third and Higher Orders, sometimes called “Consecrations” and some- times called “Sealings” to those Orders. There have been occasional liturgies written for weddings, funer- als, child namings, puberty rites, and the like, but these are usually written by an individual Grove or Druid for the occasion. Spelling Conventions Spelling Conventions Spelling Conventions Spelling Conventions Spelling Conventions It has become standard to capitalize many of the following words. There is also a great deal of variety in spelling choices. In DC(E) Isaac offered standardizations for spelling, these were: Archdruid, ArchDruidess, Archdruid/ess, Druid, Druidess, Preceptor, Neopagan, Paleopagan, Grove, Hasidic, Schismatic, Earth-Mother, Season of Life, Season of Sleep, Geimredh, Earrach, Samradh, Foghamhar, Samhain, Oimelc, Beltane, Lughnasadh, waters-of-life, waters-of-sleep, the Waters, Weekend, acorncap, tellit, Hairpull, Mishmash, Dru. I however, have not stuck to these, but you are welcome to. There are two major conventions used in the Reform in respect to the word “Druid”. In the Carleton Grove the tradition exists that “Druid” stands for any RDNA member of any of various genders. In some of the New RDNA groves, the tradition exists of indicating a female Druid by writing “Druidess” with an indefinite word of “Druid/ ess” to indicate either a male or female Druid. Since this publication is being written by a Carleton Druid, the former tradition will be used, with no offense intended. Third Order Ordination Customs Third Order Ordination Customs Third Order Ordination Customs Third Order Ordination Customs Third Order Ordination Customs Among various Groves the following customs have developed. Perhaps the oldest custom is that the new Third Order Druid buys the ordaining Arch-Druid a hearty breakfast after the ordination and is encouraged to lead the next service in the Grove. In some Groves, the Arch-Druid may read or recite passages from the Book of Medi- tations (in the Druid Chronicles) during the Vigil, his or her voice coming from the darkness. The Candidate is usually consulted as to whether this will be a help or a distraction. Visiting of the Candidate is allowed, as long as the visits are brief. Some Groves take up a collection to buy regalia for the new Druid, such as a proper red chalice or a bottle of their favorite brand of the Waters. In some Groves, it is the duty of the new Druid to lead the Grove’s next service."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"191 The only restriction on the activities of the Candidate during the vigil is that they must not not not not not sleep at all during that night and the vigil must be at least 7 hours long. While it was usually the custom that only an Arch-Druid could ordain people to the Third Order, it is now generally the custom at Carleton that any qualified Third Order Druid may perform the task upon any Second Order Druid; although it usually polite to ask the Arch-Druid first (if one exists). Any one who ordains new members to the Third Order should try to remember to send a post-card or letter of notice of this Ordina- tion to: Carleton College Archives, RE: Druid Archives, 300 North College St., Northfield, MN 55057. Apostolic Succession Apostolic Succession Apostolic Succession Apostolic Succession Apostolic Succession For those who are concerned, while any group of people can use Druid ceremonies if they really wanted to (who’s going to stop them?), only a Third Order Druid, duly ordained by a previous member of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, may consecrate the waters-of-life and the waters-of-sleep. All Third Orders should be able to trace their ordination back to the Founder of their grove, and back to the Founder at Carleton College, who got it from who knows where. The ritual for the Third Order, by vote of the Council, is not to be added to or deleted from; although gender changes of pronouns is now often done for courtesy. The ritual for the Third Order, by custom, is not generally made available to the public, to retain its full impact when being used. Establishing a Grove Establishing a Grove Establishing a Grove Establishing a Grove Establishing a Grove Traditionally, in order to establish a legal Grove, it is necessary to have at least three people. At least one of these must be a Third Order Druid, at least one of the others a Second Order member, and the last need only be a First Order member. The three or more people adopt a Constitution, usually similar to that used by the Carleton Grove and proceed to elect an Arch-Druid, a Preceptor and a Server. They may add other officers as they see fit such as, for example, a Bard, an Astrologer, a Guard, etc. Traditionally, a Third Order Druid establishing a mission should first organize a legal Grove and be elected Arch-Druid before they should ordain any new Third Order Druid. However this step has sometimes been skipped. Once one has organized a legal Grove, one should try and remem- ber to send a letter mentioning this to: the Carleton Archives, RE: Druid Archives, 300 North College St., Northfield, MN 55057. There, the record keepers will help you establish connections with other groves, should you so desire it. On Forming a Protogrove On Forming a Protogrove On Forming a Protogrove On Forming a Protogrove On Forming a Protogrove Some people reading these materials may wish to start a Grove, but may have no easy access to a Third Order Druid. What they should do is write to: Carleton Archives, RE: Druid Archives, 300 North College St., Northfield, MN 55057 and ask if there is a Third Order living in their region. With luck, there will be one nearby which may be prevailed to jump-start your grove. While waiting, groups may form Protogroves (after all, there’s nobody to stop them). Protogroves could hold regular services, though they could not properly consecrate the Waters. One substitute prayer for the consecration could be something like: “O Dalon Ap Landu, Lord of this and every Grove, bless these Waters that are held in your name.

The Higher Orders The Higher Orders The Higher Orders The Higher Orders The Higher Orders The names of the Higher Order were taken predominantly from Gaulish Paleo-Paganism, plus two Welsh names and one Irish. All are from Celtic cultures, but with vast differences between them! I, myself, think it would have been interesting if they had made an Order of the Buddha. Further details on the deities can be found in most dictionaries of Celtic Folklore and encyclopedias of mythology and god/desses. It is generally up to the individual member to deter- mine whether the names of the Higher Order are full-fledged Gods and Goddesses or whether they are Jungian archetypes. Or they may be something else entirely. The Higher Orders were established in the spring of 1964 as an encourage the Third Order to do further study and/or to encourage spiritual inquiry. They are intended to honor achievement rather than tenure. As such, the Higher Orders are equal in the sense that none shall be considered a prerequisite for the other. Admittance to a Higher Order is the prerogative of the acting Patriarch or Matri- arch of that Order. The Patriarch or Matriarch of each Higher Order designs the sym- bol or vestment of that Order. Thus the Eight, Ninth and Tenth Orders have no special symbols, because they have no Matriarch or Patriarch yet. Some more information on the higher orders can be found in the Interview with David Frangquist or Richard Shelton. Within the ARDA, look at the Ordination rites, their historiogra- phies, the Book of Customs, and the debates in the Apocrypha. The following table gives the names, origins, symbol, patronage and Or- der of each of the eight orders involved (though it is important to note that the order of listing the orders in no way implies any rank- ing between either the deities or of the orders they are patron to)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"192 Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders Special Orders: In addition to the original Higher Orders there are Special Orders or “New Orders” that have been established since 1974. Unlike the Higher Orders, most of these orders are less oriented towards Na- ture and more towards human skills or traits. The Order of Myrddin was established by Isaac Bonewits between 1974-6, the Order of Oberon by Mr. Geller between 1974-6, the Order of Diancecht (and its two subsets of Airmed and Miach) in 1976, the Order of Lugh by Carleton’s very own Katya Luomala, the Order of Angus was created in 1979 for children before puberty (the 1st Order in Berkeley was only enterable after puberty in the NRDNA). The creation of New Orders rebegan in the 1990s with Michael Scharding, who created the Order of Puck in 1994, the Order of Suzuki in 1996, and the Order of Bambi in 1996. Many of these rites are in Section Three of the Liturgies. It is noteworthy that three of them have Patrons of non-Celtic origin (Puck, Suzuki & Bambi).

Also, how- ever, in accordance with Reformed Druid practice, it should be stressed that vestments are only permitted , not required.” (David Frangquist) While the custom of dressing up for rituals has generally fallen out of practice at Carleton, occasionally it is revived. Other Groves in the Reform have generally adopted some individual customs of dressing, as is their right, most still choosing to use the traditional bedsheets. Several systems of vesting have been suggested over the years. With the exception of some of the Higher Orders, these usually break down into matters of robes and ribbons. Usually Second Order Druids, or higher, by dint of their enthusiasm, usually wear white robes (kind of like the ancient Druids). We strictly caution those people who live in the Southern US that they should not wear hoods, as this may be misconstrued by the locals and we recommend a non- white color robe for those regions. Unfortunately, according to Larson, the Klan has also adopted the use of colored robes The Third Order Druids usually wear white robes with their red or white ribbons of office around their neck, depending on if it’s the Summer Half of the Year (wear Red) or the Winter Half of the Year (wear white). If a grove has other officers (such as a bard) they, of course, can be designated to wear distinctive symbols or ribbons. IF you have a really gung-ho and rich grove you can, of course, choose to have seasonal robes for your Arch-Druid and/or grove members. Some of Isaac’s & Frangquist’s suggestions are listed here: Throughout the season of Geimredh, the robe is black with white facing. During Earrach, the robe is black with white and red facings. At the point of the Beltane service at which the sacrifice is accepted, a change to or addition of a red robe is made. Through out Samradh, the color is red or green. At Summer Solstice and Lughnasadh, the robe is green. The Samhain service begins in green, until the sacri- fice is rejected, at which point a black robe is put on and over it a white facing or robe. As for the other High Days, at Winter Solstice he suggests a solid white robe and at Oimelc black with a white facing or overgrown, to which red may be added during the service. No suggestions are made for spring equinox or fall equinox. For those of you who are poor, or who think this whole thing is silly, he suggest a simple black robe with white facings for the Winter Half of the Year and red facings for the Summer Half of the Year The use of plain white robes, with variously colored ribbons, is really much simpler and cheaper. The following traditions seem to have developed: The ribbons are usually at least two yards in length, (purchased, if at all possible, at the Ben Franklin Dime Store in Northfield Minn.) with their raw ends either sewn, painted with clear nail polish, or taped with Scotch (or Irish) tape to prevent rav- eling. See Records of the Council of Dalon ap Landu for rule govern- ing ribbons-of-office. There is a great deal of room here for inven- tion, if you should so choose. Among the Hassidic Druids, now disbanded, two other pieces of vestment were worn. The first was a special skullcap, usually of a knitted or crocheted of variegated green yarn, called an acorncap; while the second was a green and white prayershawl called a tellit , which (unlike the acorncap) is usually worn only at services or daily prayers. If a Druid is interacting with Wiccans, one should be careful that one’s Druidic ribbons or robes of office do not impinge with the system being used by the Wiccans. Black Robes Black Robes Black Robes Black Robes Black Robes Every once in a while, one will hear of a custom that “only Patri- archs may wear a black robe” and that if a Patriarch does so he may not wear at the same time the symbol of any Order other than the one he is the Patriarch of. All this is “in honor of the first Patriarch” and is an insider joke concerned with the fact that David Fisher, Founder of the RDNA and the Patriarch of Grannos, wore a black cassock and eventually became an Anglican Priest. In point of fact, hardly anyone (including the Patriarchs) ever wears a black robe at Druid services. Also note: this fun about black robes has nothing to do with either a postulated historical phenomenon called “Black Druidism” (supposedly a system of “Black Magic” - a racist term that- used by Evil Renegade Druids, way back when) nor a modern cult called “The Druidic Craft of the Wise” (whose leaders wore black robes and practiced some rather unsavory techniques of psychic manipula- tion). The reason there is no connection with either of these two concepts is twofold: none of the Founders ever heard of them, and no reputable scholar ever has either. For more details on these two concepts, see Other Druids. The Waters The Waters The Waters The Waters The Waters The Waters-of-Life are served during the Samradh and Foghamhar (Beltain on May 1st up until, but not including Samhain on Nov. 1st). The Waters-of-Sleep are used during Geimredh and Earrach (Samhain on Nov. 1st upto, but not including Beltane on May 1st). “The Waters-Of-Life are na huisci beatha in Irish Gaelic ( uisge beatha in Scots Gaelic), or what is known in English as “Whiskey”. Waters of Life therefore consist of the whiskey chosen by the Third Order Druid, mixed with water to the strength desired. There is a tradition of 3 parts water to 1 part Scotch during the Summer Half of the Year, with inverted ratios on feasts. They may either be premixed, or mixed during the service. In either case, they should be brought to the service in an appropriate container, not the original bottle. In the beginning, Scotch was used (Black & White being the standard brand at Carleton); others prefer Irish or Manx or Jim Bean. Any alcoholic beverage may be used in a pinch “The Waters-of-Sleep”, on the other hand, are just plain water, preferably not tap. Larson notes that if you don’t rinse out your Waters container, then the Waters at Samhain will still have a slight tinge of whiskey flavor. Several Groves use special Waters for the Major High Days and recommend this practice. For Samhain ordi- nary spring water; for Oimelc, sheep, goat or cow milk fresh and chilled (note- canned goat milk is abominable); for Beltane, the Waters- of-Life are mixed as strongly as is generally tolerated (most Druids drink it unpolluted); and for Lughnasadh, hard cider, applejack or mead. On the Serving of the Waters The Server does not drink from the chalice each time it is received back from one of the partaking members of the circle. To do so would be to court disaster, especially with a large congregation at Beltane. If two chalices are being circulated (one regular, one nonalcoholic), it may sometimes be advisable to have the Preceptor assist the Server by carrying one of the chalices around the circle, perhaps in the opposite direction. Larson suggests against this method, and only recommends deiseal , clockwise passing. On Teetotalers On Teetotalers On Teetotalers On Teetotalers On Teetotalers Your Grove may have one or more members who for reasons of health may not be able to tolerate drinking even the slightest sip of the weakest alcoholic beverages (for example, some diabetics, recov- ered alcoholics, people who have inherited or acquired allergies, etc.); it is unfair to deprive them of full participation because of this. Among the Schismatic Druids, it has become a habit to bring, to every Sum- mer Service where such people are expected, strong herbal teas that are fully as intoxicating as some forms of alcoholic beverages. for example, a mixture of equal parts of peppermint and linden boiled for ten minutes, then strained and chilled makes an excellent and lively drink. Or there are other herbs that can be used in the produc- tion of “magic tea” for services and ordinations (a blessing in the name of Braciaca while preparing is quite appropriate)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"194 At rituals where two chalices are to be used, one alcoholic and one not, the presiding Druid follows the same procedure as in the Ordi- nation of Second Order Druids; consecrating both chalices at the same time. Other Uses of the Waters In addition to being used during the Summer Half of the Year, the waters-of-life are also used for the Consecration of an Altar (if you use one), the Ordination of a Second or Third Order Druid, and at some wedding, healing and funeral services. Whenever pos- sible, these events should be arranged to occur during the Season of Life; however, in an emergency, a Third Order Druid may conse- crate the waters-of-life at any time of year (but should wear a red ribbon of office while doing so). The Chalice The Chalice The Chalice The Chalice The Chalice The traditional chalice in the Early Days for official Druid services was a red glass one. Originally, this was an octagonal, glass, hollow- stemmed, restaurant drinking glass (of the style called “Georgian”), purchased from the Ben Franklin Dime Store in Northfield, Minne- sota. Since the authentic dye for the making of real ruby-glass is now expensive, authentic chalices are hard to find and many Druids use any thick, heavy, inexpensive red glass chalice they can get. Yellow chalices of the style are easy to obtain and are often used as second- ary chalices for consecrating Second Order Druids and/or for pass- ing special nonalcoholic Waters during the Winter Half of the Year. Green chalices are one of the special symbols of the Fourth Order and are used in healing rituals. Various Druids use other colors of chalices for other purposes. Wood or pottery chalices are often car- ried by traveling missionaries, as being less likely to break in transit. The major thing to remember is that chalices should be inexpensive, sturdy, new if at all possible, and of natural materials. The Altar Altars have generally fallen out of custom at Carleton, but many Groves still use them. Anything may be used as an altar, including large rocks, tree stumps, record racks, etc. If an altar is not available, sacrifices may be placed directly on the ground or in a fire. Most Druids agree that the nicest arrangement is to have a stone altar in such a way as to allow the fire to be made inside the altar (see Latter Chronicles, Chapter 7, verse 1). Naturally , the altar should be built, placed, or found in a grove of trees (oaks or sequoias), on a hilltop, on the beach, on an island, or in a similar place of natural beauty. Parking lots are poor choices. The Sacrifice The Sacrifice The Sacrifice The Sacrifice The Sacrifice The various movements of the Reform (and most modern Druid movements) only permit plant sacrifices and strictly forbid blood/ animal/human sacrifices (regardless of a possible historical prece- dent). The plant is personally cut by the Third Order Druid or by the Preceptor. Any non-poisonous plant will do, though twigs from a tree branch or oak leaves are the most traditional. During the win- ter, evergreen and coniferous branches are a nice touch. One should never cut enough to damage the tree (unless one is clearing land and the large sacrifice is part of a funeral for the tree). Don’t forget to ask permission first, thank it afterwards and say a prayer for healing over the cut. Many Groves will get a special sickle for the sole purpose of cutting sacrifices. In the SDNA and the HDNA, only members of the Third Order used to wear a sickle (although a Second Order Druid, who was Preceptor, would carry one while cutting the sacri- fice, if so directed). Fires: Vigils and the ceremonies for the High Days are usually held around bonfires (the bigger, the better!). On special occasions, there are of- ten torchlit processions. Note: Local conditions and fire regulations (especially in California) may rule out fires. Let your love for the Earth-Mother decide. The Carleton Grove, since at least the 80s, has made it a policy only to use local deadfall wood or to swipe it from woodpiles made by the Grounds department. Cutting down live trees for fire wood is frowned upon at Carleton and amongst Druids in general. Times of Services Ordinary weekly services (now defunct) were usually held on Sat- urday or Sunday afternoons. Services for the High Days can be held on the evening and night of the High Day’s “Eve” or during the middle of the day or night of the festival itself. Whatever works. Bonfires & torches look more dramatic at night, but it’s easier to read one’s prayerbook in the daytime. The Summer Blessing The Summer Blessing The Summer Blessing The Summer Blessing The Summer Blessing Soon after the celebration of Beltane, the Arch-Druid makes a circuit of the Grove’s surroundings on foot, awakening, blessing and consecrating them. Any members of the Grove who wish may ac- company the Arch-Druid. Standard Liturgical Blessing Many letters and rituals end with these words: “Peace! Peace! Peace!”. Some shout them towards the three corners of area. Letter Writing Styles Certain correspondance styles have entered usage among Reformed Druids. When writing to the Council one will sometimes top the letter with “REFORMED DRUIDS OF NORTH AMERICA COUNCIL OF DALON AP LANDU” followed by the date, both in Druid Calendar and Julian. A Druid will often address each other as “Dear (First Name),” or “Dear Brother/Sister/Sibling-in-the- Mother”. If they belong to a higher or special order they may begin with “Dear Brother/Sister-in-(Name of Patron/Matron)”. When writing to the whole council, many authors will use very formal, sometimes arcane language and excessive wordiness. This is what I call “Writing like Frangquist”, in honor of the Druid Chronicles format. A common way of closing off is saying “Yours-in- the-Mother,” or “Yours-in- (higher order Patron),” for those so in- clined. No one actually writes in numbered verses, that occurs when editors collect them. Like nobility, many Reformed Druids have come to signing their documents with only their first name, followed by a Druid Sigil. Occasionally they will add whatever titles they feel are appropriate, such as current or past Archdruidcies, ODAL (short for Order of Dalon Ap Landu), Higher Orders or the name of the location they are writing from. Some of the bolder correspondants actually type their full name! (oooh!) Closing of the Grove or Arboretum Closing of the Grove or Arboretum Closing of the Grove or Arboretum Closing of the Grove or Arboretum Closing of the Grove or Arboretum Similarly, after the celebration of Samhain, the Arch-Druid makes a cir- cuit of the Grove on foot, blessing and consecrating the Season of Sleep on it. Any members of the Grove who wish to go along, may accompany the Arch-Druid. Apparently this is only a Carleton tradition. The Most Difficult Liturgical Practice Empty your mind of every custom that you have read about, every term that you have defined, every script that you have memorized, because they belong the past. Don’t plan out ahead what you will say or do. Just BE at the site. Do what seems to come naturally, say what comes to your mind, and adjust to the situation. Be creative, without being complicated. See a little bit of liturgy in every action that you do on every day. Be sure to have your heart and soul in the right place because it will be a wild trip.

They boil down to two systems; one for Carleton & the RDNA and one for Berkeley & the New RDNA, SDNA & HDNA. The difference, is that while both systems acknowledge Samhain (Nov. 1st) to be the normal beginning of the Celtic year, it is the Berkeley calendar which counts the years since the Foundation of the Reform to the Samhain that occurred before May 1st 1963, which is the first day an official RDNA ritual took place, thus beginning their year-count with Nov. 1st, 1962. The Carletonian year-count begins with May 1st, 1963. This ends up with two different year- counts being used to Druidically date documents, books and letters. Another difference is that the original RDNA didn’t recognize the Equinoxes, giving them originally 6 High Days; although the current Carleton Druids do recognized them now. I will respectfully present each system separately, beginning with the Carleton Calendar. The Carleton Dating System and Calendar (and other timely matters) Assembled for the reader’s delectation and edification by Dick Shelton, self- appointed Chronographer to the Reform. Instructions for Use: 1. Draw the Druid Sign on the ground. Enter it. Compose your thoughts. Marshal your cognitive faculties: dealing with the Druid Calendar is no mean undertaking! 2. The four Quarter Days are Samhain, Oimelc, Beltaine, and Lughnasadh. These are the first days of the four Quarters (respectively, Geimredh, Earrach, Samradh, and Foghamhar), and they correspond to November 1, February 1, May 1, and August 1. The Quarter Days, together with the Solstices (Mid-Summer and Mid-Winter), are the high feast days of Reformed Druidism 3. But the Druid Day begins at sundown on the previous day. Thus Samhain - Day 1 Geimredh = sundown Oct. 31 to sundown Nov. 1. (This is absolutely the only aspect of Reformed Dru- idism in which Druids are early.) 4. In the matter of leap years, the Reform follows the Gregorian Reform. (Who can resist a Reform?) Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, except those years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless divisible by 400. (Thus 1976 and 2000 are leap years, while 1977 and 1900 are not.) The Druid leap year day is 90 Earrach (or Day 90 of Earrach) - Primarily because the Gregorian Day (Feb. 29th) falls during Earrach; so to make 1 Samradh fall on May 1 there isn’t much choice! 5. To find a Druid date from a Gregorian one in the accompanying chart, find the Gregorian date on the bottom line of the appropriate box, and read off the Druid date from the top. To go the other way, reverse the process. During Earrach in leap years, use the middle line for Gregorian dates rather than the bottom line [ one can also use the chart in calculating & Deciphering Druid Dating”.] 6. The following mnemonic may prove useful: “89 days hath Earrach; all the rest have 92.” 7. The Druid dates for Mid-Summer and Mid-Winter [ and, of course, the Equinoxes ] vary, of course, depending on when they fall. Consult an almanac to find the time of the solstice [or equi- nox ]- the Gregorian date is not enough, because the Druid date will depend on whether the solstice falls before or after sundown: if before, the Druid date is the one the chart gives for the Gregorian date: if after, the Druid date is the next date on the chart. (Clear?) 8. The Druid Week begins at 1:00 pm Saturday, or as soon thereaf- ter as the Arch-Druid makes it to the service. (This was the traditional time of the regular weekly service at Carleton.) If there is a lot of snow on the ground, there are no Druid weeks. 9. The Druid Year begins at Samhain, much as the Druid Day be- gins at sundown. Samhain was such an important festival that the early Christian Church shrewdly invested Novem- ber 1 with the power of not any one particular patron saint, but of “All Saints.” In ancient time, Samhain did not in fact belong to either the old year or the new year; it was a day “outside of years” when supernatural forces ordinarily kept in check could come out to raise havoc, and could also be questioned for divinatory purposes. This gave rise both to Hallowe’en and to the expression “a year and a day” - the time required for a full year to pass. 10. But the Year of Worship (YOW) or Year of the Reform (YR) used by Reformed Druids for dating purposes begins at Beltaine. This gives us two “New Year Days”, marking op- posite ends of the year. Beltaine and Samhain have always been the two highest days of the year. (Man, through his temporal limitation, can hardly resist the urge to mark fun- damentally continuous things with beginnings and endings. The Druid Sign itself imposes upon the endless cycle of eternity (or upon the orb of the world) two human , finite lines. In a very real sense, the two finite lines encompass the entire human condition.) 11. Reformed Druid Worship began on Beltaine 1963, and the early record in the Carleton Grove Archives clearly indicate that the founders considered “YOW I” to have run from Beltaine 1963 to Beltaine 1964. (There is a minor difficulty that EC 1:7-8 seems to imply that some services were actually held in the month before Beltaine 1963 - but who am I to gainsay the Founders?). Let the Gregorian Year =n.

The Berkeley Dating System The Berkeley Dating System The Berkeley Dating System The Berkeley Dating System The Berkeley Dating System Years among the RDNA at Carleton are dated from the first offi- cial Reformed Druid service at Carleton in May 1963. Arch-Druid Robert Larson, who founded Berkeley in 1968 after leaving Carleton in 1965, chose to follow the Celtic custom and dated the First Year of the Reform to the Samhain (Nov. 1st) of the 1962. Thus among the NRDNA, the year beginning the day after Samhain 1962, is the First Year of the Reform, or “1 y.r.” and the year running from the day after Samhain 1963 to the day before Samhain 1964 is really 2 y.r., etc. The year in which the Druid Chronicles (Evolved ) were pre- pared, November 1975 through October 1976, was the Fourteenth Year of the Reform (14 y.r.). Naturally the years run backwards as well. Fortunately, unlike the civil calendar, the Druid calendar has a Zero date (Samhain 1962) which belongs to neither the Years of the Reform (y.r.) nor the years Before the Reform (b.r.). Let n be the Gregorian year. When the day of the year is on or between Nov 1st Dec 31st use Y.R.=(n-1961). When the day is on or between Jan 1st and Oct. 31st use y.r.=(n- 1962).

It should be noted that neither system is nec- essary. Druid Time Reformed Druids of all Branches have a habit of running on Druid Standard Time (DST), also known as Pacific Sidhe Time, Central Sidhe Time, etc. DST is always from fifteen minutes to six hours later that standard civil time, depending upon the individual Druids involved. In summer, and it would seem, “energy crises,” DST be- comes Druid Daylight Time (DDT), also know as Eastern Druid Time, Mountain Druid time, etc. In DDT the sunset is put off for an hour. If you can’t do this, you’ll have to stick with DST. The Druid Day begins at sundown of the previous standard calen- dar day (the Druid November 1st , for example, begins at sunset of the evening of October 31st). Among some of the more ritualistically oriented Druids, the total number of minutes between sunset and sunrise are divided into twelve equal “hours” and the same thing is done between the sunrise and sunset; making it easy to calculate High Noon and Mid-Night every day. Of course they have to recalcu- late them every day of the year (or get a Druid computer to do it for them), but some of them think it is worth the effort. Others disagree, especially those with electric watches. Among the Hasidic Druids, sunset was defined as that moment at which one could first see three stars in the evening sky over one’s oak grove or through the window of one’s chess club. Refusing to look over the oak grove or blocking the window was considered uncouth. The Druid Week: The Druid week begins at sunset on Friday [ as opposed to Saturday at Carleton -ed .] This makes sure of the joyful reception of the new week by the majority of the populace. Among the Hasidic and Schis- matic Druids, a two day period of rest and relaxation, was called the “Weekend”, also began at this time, with as big a feast as could be managed. Why they started the week with a celebration called Week- end is not clear. The Hasidic Druids also had their own names for the days and evenings of the week (the “eve” being the night before each day, naturally) based upon an association of a tree with each day: Satur- day -Birch, Sunday - Oak, Monday - Aspen, Tuesday - Maple, Wednes- day - Rowan, Thursday - Pine and Friday - Olive. Thus the Weekend runs from the start of Birch-eve to the end of Oak-day. The Druid Months The Druid Months The Druid Months The Druid Months The Druid Months May, August, September, October and November are known by the names here presented in Modern Irish. The other names were invented by Adr. Robert Larson by analogy to the autumn months. Larson nots, in 1996, that his guesses were confirmed by Manx calender. Manx does not use High days to denote months and uses Manx equinvalents of Tús, Meán, and Deiredh (beginning, middle, end) with the appropriate season. Note that these months do not always start on the same day as their equivalent civil months.

All this special dating, as you can guess, is a Druidic form of showing off, but it is also a way to pause and remember how long we -as an organization- have been around. There is a simple method for determining the Year or the Reform (y.r.) or Year of Worship (YOW), which is the same thing. One is to note where the person is writing from; are they of the Carleton Grove or from the NRDNA? This you’ll learn by researching the Third Order list or by asking them. People from the Groves of Carleton, Chicago, Ann Arbor, Purdue, Stanford, New York #1 and New York #2 will probably use the Carleton Convention of Dating the Year, so call up that chart listed earlier. If the authors are definitely Neo-Pa- gans, or if they come from the Bay Area or West Coast, they are likely to be using the Berkeley Convention of Dating the Year. But first you must know the day of the year, before the y.r. can be ascertained in either system. As for deciphering the date that comes before the Year of the Re- form, a few pages earlier have a key to deciphering them. On that page are gathered 6 minor columns, three major columns to a page, each column has two vertical rows of numbers in them. Take for instance the first of the three examples above; Day 64 of Geimredh. Look back a few pages until you find a major column with the word Geimredh on its left side. Go up and down on the left side of that major column until you find the number 64. Then look on the right side of that major column. You’ll find that Day 64 of Geimredh is the same as January 3rd. Since it was written by someone from Carleton, the year will be from the Carleton convention; and Year XXXI (using the formula for Carleton dates before Beltane) is 1994. The final date is January 3, 1994 of the common era. Here are some more conversions to practice deciphering.

As such, this information could be useful for everyone in the Reform and can be useful.-MS The Druid year is divided into four seasons, marked by the four Major High Days of Samhain , Oimelc, Beltane and Lughnasadh (see below). Samhain begins the season of Geimredh (gee-ru), in Modern Irish an Geimhreadh (uN gee-ru); which is Winter, running from roughly the beginning of November till the end of January. Oimelc begins the season of Earrach (u-RoCH), now an tEarrach (uN tu-RoCH); which is Spring, running roughly from the begin- ning of February till the end of April. Together, these two season constitute “the Winter Half of the Year”, otherwise known as “the Season of Sleep”. Beltane begins the season of Samradh (S‚u-Ru), now an Samhradh (un S‚u-Ru); which is Summer, running from roughly the beginning of May till the end of July. Lughnasadh begins the season of Foghamha r (FÙr), now an Fomhar (uN FÙR); which is fall or autumn, running from roughly the begin- ning of August till the end of October. Together, these two seasons constitute “the Summer Half of the Year” or “the Season of Life”. The Major and Minor High Days The Major and Minor High Days The Major and Minor High Days The Major and Minor High Days The Major and Minor High Days There are four Major High Days ( Samhain, Oimelc, Beltane & Lughnasadh ) and four Minor High Days (Winter Solstice or “Mid- winter”, Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice or “Midsummer”, and Fall Equinox) in the Druid year. While the Minor High Days are easy to obtain from any good astrological ephermis or almanac, the methods for calculation of the Major High Days will vary from Grove to Grove and branch to branch of the Reform. The most common practice for the calculation of Samhain, Oimelc, Beltane and Lughnasadh is to use the civil calendar days or eves of November 1st, February 1st, May 1st, and August 1st, respectively. Another way is to use the weekend closest to these dates. Still others use the sixth day after the new or full moon closest to each of these dates. Astrologically oriented Druids use the days upon which the Sun enters 15 degrees of each of the “Fixed Signs” of the Zodiac to wit: Eagle Point- 15 deg Scorpio, Man or Angel Point - 15 deg Aquarius, Ox Point - 15 deg Taurus and Lion Point - 15 deg Leo. The calendar used by the Berkeley Grove of the NRDNA, as well as the SDNA and the HDNA, is that designed by Adr. Robert Larson. In this calendar the Major High Days are calculated as those days upon which the Sun hits 16 deg 18 min. inclination North or South of the Celestial Equator. This make them come exactly half way be- tween the Solstices and Equinoxes. We will now, turn to some details about the Major and Minor High Days celebrated by New Reformed Druids. Samhain (SÙ-un), known in Modern Irish as L· Samhna (Laa SÙu- Nu), in Welsh as Nos Galen-graef (that is the night of the Winter Calends), in Manx as Laa Houney (Hollantide Day), Sauin or Souney ; is, of course, the eve of “All Saint’s Day”, All Hallow’s Evening or Halloween. Among other things, it is the beginning of the Winter Half of the Year (the seasons of Geimredh & Earrach ) and is known as ”the Day Between Years.” The day before Samhain is the last day of the old year and the day after Samhain is the first day of the new year (though for clarity’s sake, most New Reformed Druids assign each Samhain to the year following it. Being a day “between years,” it is considered a very magical night, when the dead walk among the living and the veils between past, present and future may be lifted in prophecy and divination. Samhain basically means “summer’s end” and many important mythological events occurred on that day. It was on a Samhain that One SDNA artist’s conception of Taranis"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"205 the Nemedians captured the terrible Tower of Glass built by the evil Formorians; that the Tuatha De Danann later defeated the Formors once and for all; that Pwyll won his wife Rhiannon from Gwawl; and that many other events of a dramatic or prophetic nature oc- curred (see Later Chronicles , Chapter 5, Verses 11-14). Many of these events had to do with the temporary victory of the forces of the dark- ness over those of light, signaling the beginning of the cold and dark half of the year. The Winter Solstice is a Minor High Day, usually occurring around December 21st or so of the civil calendar. Also known as Yule and Midwinter, this is a day sacred to Sun Gods, Thunder Gods and Fire Gods. Large fires were built up outdoors and a Yule Log lit indoors, in order to rekindle the dying Sun and help it to return brightly to the Northern skies. Burnt logs and ashes from Midwinter fires were kept as a talisman against lightning and house fires. It was also a custom in many parts of Paleopagan Europe to decorate live evergreen trees in honour of the Gods (cutting down a tree to bring indoors is a blasphemous desecration of the original concept). This is considered, along with Midsummer, the best day of the year to cut mistletoe. Among some Paleopagans, a date on or near this (such as Decem- ber 25th) was celebrated as the Birthday of the Sun God, frequently from the womb of a virgin or unmarried girl (who was sometimes also the Mother Goddess). Oimelc (i-melc), is known in Modern Irish as L· na FÈile BrÌde (Laa Nu fÈ-li bree-di), in Manx as Laa’n Arragh (Day of Spring), and as Imbolc, Candlemas and Lady Day in English. L· na FÈile BrÌde means the day of the festival of “Saint Bridget.” Brighid, Bride or Bridget is yet another Pagan deity turned by the Christians into a “saint,” in order to co-opt Her worship. This goddess was a triple- aspected deity of Poetry/Divination (considered the same thing), Healing and Smithcraft, whose followers kept an eternal flame burn- ing in Her honour. By analogy with the Gaelic names of the other High Days, we may assume that the holiday was originally called L· hOimelc (Laa Hi- melc). It is the festival of the lactation of the ewes. In Paleopagan days (and, indeed, until the recent past) the sheep was a very impor- tant animal, providing both food and clothing. The occasion of the birth of lambs (not to mention kids and calves) was a cause for rejoic- ing and a sign of life in the “dead” world of a Northern winter. The name “Candlemas” is a Christian term for a holiday occur- ring February 1st or 2nd. This supposedly is in hour of a “Saint Blaise” and has no official connection with “Saint” Bridget and Her cult of fire, nor with the fact that this day was one of the four major fire festivals of Paleopagan cultures throughout Western and North- ern Europe. Of course they don’t mention a certain Slavic god named Vlaise, Who was the Patron of cattle, wealth and war, and Who was worshipped with fire..... L· hOimelc begins the spring season of Earrach . It is also the day before St. Groundhog’s Day. The Spring Equinox, although sometimes known as the Festival of the Trees, is better known as the feast of (the Fertility Goddess) Eostara , or “Easter”. It is a celebration of the returning of life to the Earth. Rabbits, eggs and children are sacred at this feast and Pagans in need of fertility talismans now colour hollow eggs and pass them through the ceremonial fires (quickly) to take home and hang over their beds and in their barns. A fascinating source of almost forgot- ten Paleopagan symbols can be found by examining carefully the fantastically decorated eggs produced by folk artists from Europe (es- pecially Eastern Europe and Russia), Mexico and South America. A Minor High Day, in usually takes place around March 21st or so. On the night before, some Hasidic Druids stayed up until dawn, reading meditations about trees, eating the fruits of various trees and singing hymns about trees. Among many Paleopagan cultures in Southern Europe, the Spring Equinox was the date of the New Year (instead of Samhain, as it is among the Celts) and indeed, many Druids refer to this holiday as “the New Year for Trees”. Adding a bit to the confusion is the fact that some Neopagan groups call this holiday “Lady Day”. Beltane (bauL-Ti-Ni, or bauL-Hi-Ni), known in Modern Irish as L· Bealtaine (Laa bauL-Hi-ni, or Laa baul-Ti-ni), in Welsh as Galan-Mai (calends of May), in Scottish Gaelic as Baltiunn, and in Manx as Shenn da Boaddyn, La Boaldyn , or Laa’nTourey (Day of Summer); is, of course, the day we know in English as May Day. It is also called by a variety of other names, such as Roodmas, Summer Day, Walpurgistag, St. Pierre’s Day, Red Square Day, etc. It is the begin- ning of the Summer Half of the Year (the seasons of Samradh & Foghamhar ) and is a festival of unalloyed joy. A very large number of important mythological events are con- nected with this day. It was on a Beltane that Partholan and his followers, the first inhabitants and partial creators of Ireland, landed on that isle. Three hundred years later, on the same day, they re- turned to the Other World. It was on a Beltane that the Tuatha De Danann and their people invaded Ireland. It was on a May Eve that Pryderi, the missing son of Rhiannon and Pwyll (Rulers of the Welsh Otherworld) was lost by them and later (on another May Eve) was found by Teirnyon Twryf Vliant (and eventually restored to Them ). On every first day of May “till the day of doom,” Gwyn-son-of-Nudd fights with Gwyrthur-son-of Greidawl, for the hand of Lludd’s (Lugh’s) fair daughter, Creudylad. Most of these events, again, as all over Europe, have to do with stories of the forces of light defeating the forces of darkness. Why did you think the Marxists chose May Day as their international Holiday? And can you guess why Adam Weishaupt chose Walpurgistag as the day to announce the founding of the Bavarian Iluuminati, and why the date at which the forces of evil later tired to Imannetize the Eschaton? The Summer Solstice is a Minor High Day, usually occurring around June 21st or so. Also known as St. John’s Day and Midsum- mer (and, confusingly enough, by at least one Neo-Pagan group, as Beltane !), it shares mythical elements with both Beltane and Lughnasadh . Like both, it is a feast celebrating the glory of summer and the peak of the Sun God’s power. But in many systems of belief, it is the day of the biggest battle of the year between the Dark Sun God and the Lugh Sun God (or between the evil one and the good one), Who are usually brothers or otherwise intimately related. Mid- summer is a peak from which the Sun can only fall, for it is the day on which the hours of light slowly begin to shorten. In those areas where it is safe to do so , Neopagans frequently will light cartwheels of kindling and roll them down from the tops of high hills, in order to symbolize the falling of the Sun God. Lughnasadh (Loo-Nu-Su) is known in Modern Irish as L· L ̇nasa (Laa Loo-Nu-Su), in Welsh as Gwyl Awst (August Feast), as Lla Lluanys or Laa’n Ouyr (Day of the Harvest Season) in Manx and as Lammas, Apple Day and Harvest Home in English. It is the anniversary of the funeral games given by Lugh, the God of All Crafts, in honour of his Father. Essentially a harvest festival, this signals the beginning of the harvest season and the ripening of the apples (as well as other fruits and vegetables). Enormous quantities of applejack, hard cider, mead and other alcoholic beverages are consumed at this time (it’s almost a duty!) by all enthusiastic Neopagans. Hasidic Druids may prefer to drink ten-day-old slivovitz (plum brandy) at this time, but it’s their stomach lining! This holiday is a day of mixed joy and woe (Irish wakes are an old tradition), for it is by now obvious that the days are getting shorter. Stories of the battles between Lugh and Balor (the good Sun-Fire God and the bad one) are retold, as the autumn quarter of Foghamhar begins."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"206 The last big holiday of the year, the Fall Equinox (sometimes called Michaelmas and the Feast of the Hunters) is a Minor High Day occurring somewhere around September 21st or so. This is a Thanks- giving feast and signals the beginning of the Hunting Season (for deer and other large game) in many parts of Europe and North America. Thus, it is dedicated to the Hunting and Fishing Gods and the Gods of Plenty, in thankfulness for benefits received and hoped for. Outdoor picnics in the woods are a popular Druid tradition in those areas where the weather is still good at this time of year. Hunt- ing magic may be minimized by those Groves living in areas where game is a little dear.

Conclusion to Part Four As you can tell, most of the material in this section is considered irrelevant trivia to most of the Reformed Druids. I hope that you have found it amusing, because I laugh out loud everytime I read certain sections. The mere idea that any Reformed Druid (such as myself) could actually be bothered with such a complicated mess of materials, forces me into hysterical laughter. None of the material in this section should be considered unal- terable dogma, it merely a collection of customs and terms that have been used over the last 33 years. There is no reason why most of them cannot be replaced with new ideas. Yours in the Mother, Michael"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"208"}]
