It’s one of the most comprehensive lists ever compiled of the symbols and images found in the tarot, especially the classic Rider-Waite Tarot and most of its derivatives. The Symbolist also includes a wide range of tarot-related terminology, as well as a summary of the basic mythology, astrology, and numerology that many tarot readers use in their work. The Symbolist is easy to use. It’s arranged alphabetically, so you can quickly access the standard Western interpretation of hundreds of individual symbols and illustrations. The definitions are short and sweet, designed for quick reference. This guide assumes that you already are familiar with most of the background information to which the tarot’s symbols refer — and the listings you’ll find in the next few pages will simply jump start your memory. If you’d like a more detailed analysis of the history and symbolism of the tarot in depth, you’ll probably want to refer to the works listed at the end of this guide. They’re all wonderful sources for enriching your work with the cards. Please send me your suggestions I hope you enjoy working with The Symbolist, and that it enhances your tarot studies and readings. I’d love to hear what you think of it — and if you have any additions for future editions, please let me know! You can send them by e-mail to Corrine@TwoOfCups.com, or by regular mail in care of Two of Cups Tarot, PO B o x 11350, St. Paul, MN 55111-0350. Enjoy!

The Fool. Technically, The Fool is the Major Arcana’s only unnumbered card. A wanderer, most Tarot experts agree that The Fool represents each of us — naive travelers through life, off on a grand adventure, out to learn whatever experience and the tarot can teach us. 1. The Magician. The Magician represents an individual in control of life’s tools and techniques, like those on the table in front of him. Typically, they include a cup, a sword, a pentacle, and a wand — the four symbols of the Minor Arcana. 2. The High Priestess. Secretive and guarded, The High Priestess knows the secrets life holds — but shares them only with the wise. 3. The Empress. The archetypical mother, The Empress nurtures and protects all of nature, including humankind. 4. The Emperor. The archetypical father, the authoritative Emperor brings order out of chaos so that civilization can prosper. 5. The Hierophant. A symbol of traditional authority and influence, The High Priest is a spiritual link to humanity’s higher powers. 6. The Lovers. While an appearance by this couple could encourage any hopeless romantic, The Lovers also signify a choice to be made between two equally strong d e s i r e s . 7. The Chariot. The young charioteer is in command of his physical and emotional drives, symbolized by the two opposing forces that pull The Chariot. 8. Strength. A woman gently holds the jaws of a powerful lion, patiently controlling a force that could otherwise eat her alive. 9. The Hermit. Far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, The Hermit reflects on spiritual concerns. He carries his light of wisdom as a beacon for others to follow. 10. The Wheel of Fortune. Because nothing is certain but change itself, The Wheel of Fortune reminds us all that what goes up must also come down. 11. Justice. In many representations of the Justice card, Justice is blind to superficial concerns. And in most, she holds a two-edged sword — a reminder that fairness cuts both ways. 12. The Hanged Man. He sacrifices his comfort and passions for a time, like the Norse god Odin, knowing that better things will occur as a result. 13. Death. Not the frightening specter that most of us expect, the card of Death is one of transition. It foretells the completion of one stage of life and the exciting beginning of a new phase.

With dexterity and grace, Temperance demonstrates how balance can serve as a bridge to wholeness. 15. The Devil. With tongue firmly in cheek, the Devil of the Major Arcana shows us that a selfish devotion to material possessions and ill-conceived passions ties us down and keeps us from true happiness. 16. The Tower. Should we build ourselves up too high, The Tower card warns that a bolt from the blue could shake us to our very foundations. 17. The Star. The card of faith and hope, The Star is a shining light in the darkness. 18. The Moon. Deeply rooted in the unconscious, the dreamlike Moon symbolizes secrets and mysteries that may not be understood — or even recognized. 19. The Sun. Nothing can hide in the bright light of day, and even the most dour individuals come out to celebrate. 20. Judgement. All is revealed, as the Judgement card reminds us to forgive and be forgiven. 21. The World. A card of completion and success, The World is the last stop on The Fool’s journey. 4 • The Symbolist"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Quick Reference Guide: Major Arcana Keywords 0.

They can represent other people or they can reflect aspects of our own personality. Sometimes, they can even illustrate what we think of ourselves, by depicting qualities that we like and dislike in others. Pages are young, with childlike enthusiasm and an unbounded capacity to learn. They also are willing messengers, eager to deliver news and greetings to appreciative adults. Knights are adventurers, eager to go out into the world. They’re on a sacred quest — for success, for honor, and for the ever-elusive gifts of the spirit. Even so, they don’t hesitate to rescue and defend others along the way. Queens are mature women, gracious and wise in the ways of the world. They’re especially good at working with others. Queens nurture and direct unbridled energy into useful channels. Kings are seasoned, experienced men. Most have successfully completed the quests they began as knights, and they’ve moved on to accept the corresponding responsibility of their achievements. Kings are authoritative rulers and strong protectors. Wands Page of Wands: imminent spiritual growth, typically through flashes of inspiration and an abundance of creative energy. Knight of Wands: the beginning of spiritual adventures, or the availability of spiritual aid. Queen of Wands: the power to foster and guide your creative energy. King of Wands: the power to govern and safeguard your creative energy. Cups Page of Cups: imminent emotional growth, typically through flashes of intuition and increased sensitivity to the feelings and needs of others. Knight of Cups: the beginnings of emotional adventures or emotional healing. Queen of Cups: the power to foster and guide your emotional energy.
