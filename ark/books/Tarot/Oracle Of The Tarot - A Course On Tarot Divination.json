The practice of fortune-telling is based on the false notion that human life is governed by luck, chance, or fate—by obscure powers at work outside the personality. True divination rests upon the occult truth that the causes of all events in human life are really internal, proceeding from the Cause of Causes—the Universal Intelligent Energy or Life-power which is the Source, Mover and Knower behind all the phenomena of the universe. Because this Universal Intelligent Energy is omnipresent, it must necessarily be a real presence at any given point in space. Consequently it must be the real Presence at the heart of every human personality. That Presence is the True Self, the real I AM, the Concealed Divinity in the shrine of the temple of personality. This True self is the author of all phenomena, and its perfect knowledge includes all the details of phenomenal manifestation, past, present and future. It knows all events, and the significance of all events. Thus it knows the complete past, present and future of every human being. Ordinarily this perfect knowledge of the True Self is hidden from us; but under certain conditions some part of it may be brought down into the personal level of awareness. The right use of Tarot provides the necessary conditions, because Tarot is a device invented by expert psychologists who understood the laws whereby the superconscious knowledge of the True Self may be brought to bear upon the specific problems which confront us as we function at the self-conscious level of our waking existence. The Tarot Keys are composed of pictorial and geometrical symbols. These symbols are the natural “language” of the subconscious mind, a language older than any human tongue, a language from which all modes of human speech have been derived. Fundamentally we think in pictures, not in words, and this pictorial language, common to the whole human race, is the means whereby the subconscious mind may communicate to us the higher knowledge reflected from the superconscious levels of the True Self. As you begin to study divination, bear in mind that it is not meant to satisfy your own or another’s idle curiosity about the future. Take the work seriously. What you are about to learn is a method whereby you may bring to bear upon your own problems, and upon the problems of those who consult you, the light of the superconscious knowledge of past, present and future which is characteristic of the mental activity of the One Life-power. To deal lightly with this is truly to profane the most sacred of mysteries, and the penalty for such profanation in inevitable. He who debases Tarot to mere fortune-telling will rob himself of whatever insight he may possess. He will deceive himself and others by false visions, and may open the door to dangerous obsession by inimical astral entities."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2 Oracle of Tarot Introduction The practice of divination offers you a real opportunity to serve, and will aid you to unfold intuitive powers of a high order. As you become more and more proficient, you will be called upon by persons beset by all sorts of perplexities, faced by all sorts of seeming obstacles, troubled by all sorts of appearances of inharmony. As you gain their confidence they will tell you their inmost secrets. Never abuse that confidence. Make it a rule not to discuss the affairs of your consultants—not even anonymously. There is altogether too much comparison of horoscopes, altogether too much discussion of the affairs of clients, in certain circles of persons interested in astrology, palmistry, numerology, and other divinatory arts. Furthermore, avoid personal judgement of the lives of your consultants. Even when their views and conduct differ radically from your opinions and standards, remember that every condemnatory judgement is evidence that he who makes it is himself more or less in the dark. To divine well you must be in sympathetic rapport with your consultants, and there can be no sympathy where there is condemnation. After these preliminary observations we may proceed to a brief examination of... The Tarot Pack For divination the best pack of Tarot cards now available is that given with this course of Lessons. It was drawn by J. A. Knapp under the supervision of Manly P. Hall, and is an excellent example of the exoteric Tarot. It has, furthermore, the decided advantage that the cards are of such size that they may be conveniently shuffled and dealt. In calling this an exoteric pack I mean that it is simply a better-drawn and better-colored version of that version of Tarot issued, some centuries ago, by the Western School of occult adepts, who purposely disguised it as a game. The Keys of this exoteric pack, particularly the picture- cards called major trumps or greater arcana, are neither so exact nor so explicit in their symbolism as are the cards of the esoteric Tarot. The later, at this writing, has not been published. The Rider pack, designed under the supervision of A. E. Waite, approximates the esoteric version. So does the set of major trumps drawn by Jessie Burns Parke some years since at my suggestion. Waite’s version and mine approximate the esoteric designs we have both seen. The present pack of Mr. Knapp’s is practically the same as any good example of eighteenth century exoteric packs, except for the small symbols added at Manly Hall’s suggestion, which are mostly good. And the symbolism of these Keys is sufficiently exact for every purpose of divination. Even for the higher uses of Tarot it is not wholly incorrect. In the original exoteric Tarot no Hebrew letters were printed on the major trumps. Since Eliphas Levi wrote The Dogma and Ritual of Transcendental Magic nearly all books on Tarot have reproduced the “blind” attribution of the letters to the major trumps first published in that remarkable volume. C. C. Zain uses yet another attribution, but if it is compared with that given below its inadequacy becomes evident. I have dealt with this whole matter in other of my writings. Here it is enough to say that Levi knew the correct attribution, but was under"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"3 obligation not to reveal it. Hence he chose a blind which would lead the more discerning among his readers to discover the correct arrangement. Unfortunately, those of his admirers and disciples who have written books about the Tarot (including Papus, Stanislas de Guiata, Dr. and Mrs. Curtis, Manly P. Hall, and others of lesser note) have either failed to perceive Levi’s blind, or else have felt themselves bound to perpetuate it. The true arrangement, long held in reserve by the School of Adepts who originally issued the Tarot as we now have it, came by accident into the possession of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. A former member of that society, convinced that its claim to direct connection with the Secret Chiefs of the True Rosicrucian Order was a false claim, broke away from the Hermetic Order, published its rituals, and also made public the attribution given below. Three years prior to this I had myself been led to the discovery of the true arrangement, which follows: Figure 1-1 Hebrew Attributions of the Major Trumps 1 Aleph (A) 0 Le Fou 2 Beth (B) 1 Le Bateleur 3 Gimel (G) 2 La Papesse 4 Daleth (D) 3 L'imperatrice 5 Heh (H) 4 L'empereur 6 Vau (V) 5 Le Pape 7 Zain (Z) 6 L'amoureux 8 Cheth (Ch) 7 Le Chariot 9 Teth (T) 11 La Force 10 Yod (I) 9 L'ermite 20 Kaph (K) 10 La Roue de la Fortune 30 Lamed (L) 8 La Justice 40 Mem (M) 12 Le Pendu 50 Nun (N) 13 La Mort 60 Samekh (S) 14 La Temperance 70 Ayin (O) 15 Le Diable 80 Peh (P) 16 Le Feu Du Ciel 90 Tzaddi (Tz) 17 Les Etoiles 100 Qoph (Q) 18 La Lune 200 Resh (R) 19 Le Soleil 300 Shin (Sh) 20 Le Jugement 400 Tau (Th) 21 Le Monde"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4 Oracle of Tarot Introduction This arrangement enables us to determine the astrological meanings of the major trumps. The key to these meanings is partially given in the various printed versions of the Hebrew Book of Formation , or Sepher Yetzirah . All versions of this book agree that the mother letters, Aleph, Mem and Shin represent the elements Air, Water and Fire. All versions also agree that the simple letters Heh, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi and Qoph represent the signs of the zodiac. But none of the published versions agree as to the attribution of the seven heavenly bodies known in ancient astrology to the seven double letters, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh, Resh and Tau. These were probably kept secret when the Book of Formation was first published, for fear that the correct arrangement might lead to the premature disclosure of certain practical secrets. But as the correct arrangement has now come to light, its accuracy will be obvious to every really competent symbolist. Learn these attributions by heart, so thoroughly that you recall them without the least effort.

In the esoteric Tarot the numbers of the Keys corresponding to Leo and Libra are different from those given above. In the esoteric pack Strength, corresponding to Leo, is numbered 8, and Justice, corresponding to Libra, is numbered 11. So also in Waite’s Tarot and in those which I use for philosophical work. Besides the 22 major trumps there are 56 minor trumps similar to ordinary playing-cards, which are derived from the Tarot. The minor trumps comprise ten spot-cards numbered from Ace to 10, arranged in four suits, which are: Wands (Clubs); Cups (Hearts); Swords (Spades); Pentacles or Coins (Diamonds). In addition to these numbered cards, each suit includes four court-cards. In the Knapp pack these are designated by letters, as follows: King (K); Queen (Q); Knight or Warrior (W); Page or Servant (S). Kings represent Spirit; Queens are symbols of Soul; Knights or Warriors correspond to the astral body; Pages or Servants represent the physical body. These are their more general meanings. Their particular divinatory meanings will be given in the lessons wherein the separate cards of each suit are explained from the divinatory standpoint. The general divinatory meaning of the four suits of minor trumps is as follows, but each card has a separate meaning to be considered later: Figure 1-3: Divinatory Meanings of the Four Suits This suit... ...represents these concepts... ...and element. Wands Work, enterprise, ideas; the energies of the spiritual plane or archetypal world (Plato’s world of ideas) Fire Cups Desires, hopes, wishes; emotional activities; the states and forces of the mental plane, the creative world in which mental patterns are formulated; Water Swords Action, and therefore conflict of forces; the states and activities of the astral plane, the formative world of unseen forces which build the conditions of the physical plane; Air Coins or Pentacles Things, possessions; the concrete objects and bodies of the physical plane; the objectification of the energies and forces of the higher worlds or planes represented by Wands, Cups and Swords; Earth"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 Oracle of Tarot Introduction The Significator This is the card chosen to represent the Querant, or person for whom a divination is made. This may be Le Bateleur (Key 1) for a man, or La Papesse (Key 2) for a woman. In a subsequent lesson you will find a method for selecting the Significator, based on the Querant’s birth-date; but many good diviners invariably use Le Bateleur for a man, and La Papesse for a woman. Formulating The Question This is the first step in a divination. When you divine for yourself, state the question as you begin to shuffle the entire pack. If you are divining for another person, let the Querant formulate his question as you begin to shuffle the cards. If the Querant has formulated his question before sitting down opposite you at the table where the divination is to be made, bid him or her concentrate upon the question, and, if possible, endeavor to restate it while you are shuffling. This formulation of the question by the Querant is wholly mental, and the Querant should be careful to say nothing whatever, at the beginning of the divination, that will indicate the nature of the question. First Operation The diviner shuffles the entire pack until he feels like stopping the shuffle, or until the pack begins to feel heavy in his hands. One comes soon to recognize this feeling. While shuffling the diviner should mentally and most earnestly invoke the aid of the true self to assist in the operation. After the shuffle the diviner hands the entire pack to the Querant, who cuts it once, completing the cut so that the portion of the pack which was at the bottom when the Querant received it from the diviner is now on top. The diviner now takes the cards, and with his left hand cuts the pack into two piles, from right to left, on the table before him, thus: Pile Pile 1 2 He then cuts each of these into tow piles, again to the left, and with his left hand, so that Pile 3 is taken from Pile 1, and Pile 4 from Pile 2, as shown below. Pile Pile Pile Pile 4 2 3 1 These four piles of cards, counting from right to left, represent the four letters of the Hebrew divine name, YOD-HEH-VAU-HEH (IHVH, or Jehovah), thus:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"7 HEH 2 VAU HEH 1 YOD Pile Pile Pile Pile 4 2 3 1 The diviner now examines these piles of cards, to find in which one the Significator, (Bateleur or Papesse) is located. If the Significator appears in the YOD Pile (No. 1) the diviner says to the Querant: “Your question is about the beginning of some enterprise, about the root-ideas behind some matter. It is more concerned with causes than with outward conditions, and may have to do with the spiritual life.” If the Significator appears in the HEH Pile (No. 3), the diviner says: “Your question has to do with your desires and wishes, with the formation of plans, with some state of your emotions or affections, with matters in which your feelings are deeply affected.” If the Significator is in the VAU Pile (No. 2), the diviner says: “You want to know what to do, what action is best to bring about some result, either to avoid some conflict with others, or to overcome some conflict which has already come up. Your question is somehow connected with inharmony, with disappointment, either actual or threatened.” If the Significator be in the 2nd HEH Pile (Pile 4), the diviner says: “Your question has to do with the things of the outer world, or practical life. It is almost wholly concerned with material affairs.” The beginner will do well to commit these paragraphs to memory, until he has progressed far enough to depend more completely on intuition. In any case the substance of what the diviner says to the Querant is always as above. Be careful at this point not to let the Querant state his question to you. You should be able to state it to him, by reason of the position of the Significator. You may have to add some few words of explanation to those suggested above, but unless the Querant acknowledges that you have correctly determined the main substance of his question, abandon the attempt to divine for him, and do not resume it for at least two hours. Better still, wait until the next day. If you are unable to determine the nature of the question by the position of the Significator the divination is “not radical,” as astrologers say of those indications in a horary chart which indicate that no attempt should made to give advice or delineation. Never proceed with a divination unless you have been successful in this first operation."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 Oracle of Tarot Introduction Practice Before continuing with the next lesson, you should practice every day, at first by yourself, and then with a sympathetic friend. Carry the whole first operation through, up to the formulation of the question, in accordance with the position of the Significator. Put a different question, and a different kind of a question, each time. Keep a record of your practice, in which you note: 1. the number of attempts; 2. the number of times the Significator fell in a pile that corresponded to the question; 3. the number of times the Significator did not so fall. Continue this preliminary practice for at least one week before going further."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 Lesson 2: The Suit Of Wands TAKE the 14 cards of the suit of Wands from your pack, and put the Servant or Page face up on the table before you. On this put the Warrior, then the Queen, then the King, then the spot- cards, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace. You will then have all the Wands in a pile, face up, with the Ace on top and the Servant at the bottom. This is the order of the following paragraphs. As you read a paragraph look again and again at the card it describes. When you have finished the first paragraph, turn over the Ace, to the left, as you would the page of a book. Continue until you have read the 14 paragraphs. Do this at least once a day for a week, and you will find that you know the cards. Do not write anything on the cards. The suit of Wands corresponds to the first letter of IHVH, the letter Yod, to the archetypal world of ideas, to spiritual energy, to force and initiative, and to the element Fire . This element is represented by the upright triangle."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 Oracle of Tarot Suit of Wands Ace of Wands The triangle is black, but radiant, symbolizing the Radiant Darkness or Potential Energy in which all beginning, symbolized by the white, dotted circle, concentrates itself.

Note carefully the time-attributions, for upon them and their astrological significance, blended with that of the numbers, the divinatory meanings are based. But at this point in your work you should not attempt to locate events by the time-period of the separate cards. Practice Work 1. Shuffle and cut the cards as in the first operation , in order to determine whether or not the question is radical. 2. Take the pile of cards in which the Significator is placed, shuffle it thoroughly, and cut once with the left hand, restoring the cut, as in the first operation. 3. Deal the cards, face down, in three piles, from right to left, thus: Pile Pile Pile 3 2 1 Future Present Past"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"19 4. Turn Pile 1 face up, and look through it to see if it contains the Significator. If it does, say: “The dominant ideas in relation to your question had their origin in some idea which you held in the past.” If the Significator is not in this pile, look to see if there are any cards of the Wand suit therein. Read each of these as you come to it, counting from the face of the small pack, held in your hand. But read it always in the past tense. If neither the Significator nor any cards of the Wand suit are in this pile of cards, put it aside, and say: “Your question is little concerned with any idea formulated by you in the past,” and go on to the next step of the operation. 5. Turn Pile 2 face up, and look for the Significator. If it is in this pile say: “The dominant ideas in relation to your question have to do with something in the immediate present, or have just been formulated.” If the Significator is not in this pile, read any cards of the Wand suit you may find in it, but always in relation to the present. 6. Turn up Pile 3, and repeat as before, except that all the reading from this group of cards in related to the future, and it is in relation to this pile that most of your advice to the Querant will be given. N.B. No matter what Pile the Significator is in, read whatever cards of the Wand suit you find in either of the three piles. The point about the Significator is simply that it shows the Querant's personal attitude to be more particularly related either to past, present, or future. Shuffle the cards so that some of them will be reversed. For the purpose of this kind of reading, those which are upside-down are regarded as being ill-dignified. This type of divination, which will be elaborated in subsequent lessons so as to include the cards of all four suits, and those of the major trumps, may be used for practice in learning the attributions, and should be the only method employed for any but really serious questions. It is often surprisingly accurate for the solution of all minor problems, and has the advantage of being the only divinatory method which may be safely used for entertainment among persons who are not deeply interested in occultism, or among those likely to be sceptical."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 Oracle of Tarot Suit of Wands"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"21 Lesson 3: The Suit of Cups ARRANGE the 14 cards of this suit as you arranged the Wands in the p recedin g lesson .

Just as the Cups in Tarot are not, on the whole, so fortunate as Hearts are taken to be in ordinary fortune-telling, so the Swords, as symbols of Air or the Life-Breath, are less adverse than Spades are usually supposed to be. Lay out the cards for study as in the preceding two lessons. Ace of Swords The ankh cross, similar to a Venus symbol, represents the union of positive and negative forces, and thus corresponds to VAU, the third letter of the Great Name, IHVH. The Swords are all symbols of AIR, which is alchemically the mixture of the hot and dry nature of FIRE with the cool and moist nature of WATER, but with the heat and dryness predominant over the cold and moisture. Thus AIR is more fiery than watery, and there is a closer affinity between Swords and Wands than between Swords and Cups. The Ace of Swords symbolizes Invoked Force, by way of contrast to the Natural Force typified by the Ace of Wands . Occult title The root of the powers of air. Meanings In the Knapp Tarot it is shown point downward, but this represents its evil and negative significance, for in ceremonial magic the sword in this position is used for the invocation of the evil and demonic forces. On ancient exoteric and esoteric versions of this Key the single sword often is shown with its point upward, and the point is surrounded by a radiant Crown, symbolizing the invocation of spiritual Radiance. Thus, in using this card, it is to be considered Ill-dignified if it appears with the point of the sword down, and Well-dignified if in the reverse position.

Meanings Contradictory characters in the same nature: strength through suffering; pleasure after pain. Delay in the realization of objectives. It intimates a period of uncertainty, in which the Querant, through he has a sense of adequate power, does not know just what to do with it. Justice, unselfishness, and the restoration of peace. Ill-dignified Falsehood, sorrow; injury from another who means the Querant well, or injury by the Querant to another in the same way.

Practice Work For this week add to the consideration of the cards of the Sword suit to the Wands and Cups that appear in the divination. Read them with especial reference to the types of activity bearing on the Querant's problem. From them, also, may be gained some hints as to the subtler forces playing upon the Querant and those other persons who are involved in his problem, for the Sword suit always refers to the influences of the astral plane. You will notice that the 2, 3, and 4 of a suit always refer to the decanates of the cardinal sign of the element to which the suit corresponds. The 5, 6 and 7 always refer to the three decanates of the fixed sign of that element. The 8, 9 and 10 always refer to the three decanates of the mutable and common sign. Kings have their principal influence in the cardinal sign of the element to which the suit corresponds. Queens refer to the fixed sign of that element. Warriors refer to the mutable or common sign. Thus there is an affinity between Kings and the 2, 3 or 4 of a suit; between the Queen and the 5, 6 or 7; and between the Warrior and the 8, 9, and 10. In the more extended system of divination to be taken up in detail in later lessons, all this has a direct bearing upon the judgement of the dignity of the cards."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"41 Aces and Servants or Pages are related to the cardinal sign of the element to which the suit is referred. The Aces represent the causal aspect of the element. The Pages or Servants represent persons and conditions which bring the force of that element into manifestation externally. Their influence extends during the whole quarter of the year which is under their influence. In divining, the less you say about why you make certain statements, as a rule, the better. Always say whatever you are impelled to say, even though in so doing you may be departing a little from the strict significance of the card that is your starting-point for the statement. Remember that you help your Querant to the degree that you get in touch with his subconsciousness, and to the degree that you keep open the channel leading to your own superconsciousness. If a person or a scene comes into your mental field of vision very definitely, do not hesitate to describe that person or scene. But to keep yourself from wandering off into mere personal fantasy, check your vision as you go along. You will find that if you make a statement with just a suggestion of a rising inflection, the Querant will usually respond with some word of assent or denial. Ask as few questions as you can, but watch carefully the expression of the Querant's face, especially his eyes and lips. Divination will lead to the unfoldment of clairvoyance, if you happen to be gifted in that direction. But successful divination demands that you exercise to the full your powers of observation, so as to keep yourself on the right track. But be careful that you do not so completely identify yourself with your Querant that you lose your own detached attitude toward his problem. It is his problem, not yours, and if you are to help him, you must not share his emotional bias, for that is just what usually clouds his judgement, and you cannot help him if your own judgement is overshadowed by the same cloud."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 Oracle of Tarot Suit of Swords"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"43 Lesson 5: The Suit of Coins THE cards of this suit correspond to the final letter of IHVH, to the material world of objective forms, and to the element Earth . As the things of this lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds have money-value, Coins represent that value, as do the Diamonds of ordinary playing-cards. In the esoteric Tarot this suit is named Pentacles, from the circular wax or metal plate, engraved with the sigils and names used in an operation of ceremonial magic. In the Knapp Tarot each card of the Coins suit bears a cube, the Pythagorean symbol of the material world. Ace of Coins On the face of the small cube is a double vesica pisces, which also resembles the mathematical symbol of infinity and rhythmic whirling motion, the horizontal figure 8. This refers to the Qabalistic idea that physical form is the result of a series of whirling motions originating in the Primal Will—an idea practically the same as that to which modern physicists have been led by their investigations into the constitution of matter. The connection of the Ace of Coins with the Hebrew ideas relating to the Divine Number 1 is shown by the crown over the upper point of the pentagram, or five-pointed star. Behind the pentagram is a glory composed of forty rays, suggesting the operation of the ten Divine Numbers in the four Qabalistic worlds; and intimating also that the solidest physical forms are manifestations of the whirling motion of radiant energy. Of this motion the pentagram itself is another symbol, and its employment in various magical operations is based upon mathematical formulas directly connected with the figure itself, which formulas lead to mental control of the currents of the Astral Light.

But now read the cards of all four suits. In order to develop skill in interpretation read the first heap as representing the morning, the middle heap as representing the afternoon, and the third heap as representing the evening. For this practice it is not necessary to formulate a question. Keep a record of each morning’s layout, and check the day’s events to see how close you came to what actually occurs. If more convenient, the layout may be made at night. The main point is to record it and check it."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"53 Lesson 6: The Major Trumps FIGURE 1-1 shows the attributions of the major trumps of Tarot to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and to the elements, planets, and signs of the zodiac which are attributed to those letters in the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation. Readers of these pages who are familiar with astrology will at once see the connection between these astrological attributions and the divinatory meanings of the major trumps. It should, perhaps, be said that although Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were unknown to ancient astronomy within the historical period, there is evidence that these planets were known in prehistoric times. The Tarot Keys which correspond to them are plainly symbolic representations of the particular planets to which they correspond. Furthermore, Uranus is predominantly a planet of the airy quality, and AIR is the element attributed to Aleph, first of the three mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Neptune, which corresponds to the letter Mem, to which the element of Water is assigned in the Book of Formation , is predominantly watery in its astrological significance. Pluto, the most recently discovered planed in our system, is little understood astrologically, but as time goes on, it seems probable that its influence will be found to be closely analogous to that of the fiery element depicted in Tarot by Key 20, The Judgement, the true correspondence to the letter Shin."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps 0, The Fool The design for this Key is perhaps the least happy in its symbolism of all the cards in the Knapp Tarot. In the old eighteenth century exoteric packs the Fool was not blindfolded, nor was he the altogether idiotic figure shown in the Tarot which was drawn by Oswald Wirth in 1880. The oldest name for this Key was Le MAT, and this word MAT is the clue to the whole mystery of the card. For MAT is the transposition of the Hebrew word AMT, or Ameth, signifying truth . The crocodile in this picture was a suggestion of Eliphas Levi, and it does not appear in any exoteric Tarot prior to his time. It is, however, fairly good symbolism, because the crocodile is the Egyptian god regarded as the Vehicle of Horus, and as Horus himself. Thus the Fool, about to fall into the mouth of the crocodile, is a symbol of the power which is to be incarnate as Horus, and that power is the pure spirit of Truth or the sky-power , for which the Greek name is OURANOS, or Heaven. Thus, when the New Testament speaks of the “kingdom of heaven” the same word “Ouranos” is used, and this is the original of our English Uranus. Curiously, in drawing this design, Mr. Knapp has (unintentionally, he tells me) introduced a very obvious Uranian symbol. The notched ornaments of the Fool’s dress are so disposed that they bear a close resemblance to the familiar symbol of the sign Aquarius, ruled by Uranus. This is an example of the way in which the Tarot designs have been, so to say, protected through all their variations. For when an artist sits down with the intention of drawing a Tarot Key forces play upon him of which he may have no conscious knowledge. Meanings Much depends upon the position of this Key in relation to others in the layout. In spiritual matters Originality, audacity, a tendency to iconoclasm, venturesome quest of higher truth. Uranus upsets fixed conceptions. He disturbs habits, breaks up customary modes of expression, forces readjustments. Thus, whenever the Zero card appears in a Tarot layout it signifies sudden readjustment, and often indicates the unexpected onset of chaotic conditions. In spiritual matters this is all to the good. In material matters Folly, eccentricity, sudden action without sufficient consideration or forethought, stupidity, or even insanity."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"55 1, Le Bateleur “Bateleur” means “juggler,” or prestidigitator.” Thus the name given to this trump in the exoteric Tarot refers to the lower aspects of Mercury. Here is a symbol of manual dexterity, like that suggested by the rulership of Mercury in Gemini. The mountebank who surprises yokels by his sleight-of hand, the trickster in the commercial world, the subtle deceiver—these are the lower meanings of the card. That Manly Hall accepts the attribution of this Key to Mercury is sufficiently clear from his having had the caduceus, or wand of Mercury, put in the Juggler’s left hand. The sceptre, cup, sword and coins on the table are the emblems of the Tarot suits, the things which the Juggler plays with. And if we remember that the minor trumps of the Tarot are all related to definite time-periods, we shall understand something of importance here. For Mercury is also the personification of the self-conscious mind. He is the Thoth of the Egyptians, and in Egyptian symbolism he was sometimes represented as a dog. Thus the Juggler is the dog who bites the Fool’s leg in the preceding Key. He feeds on the movement, or motive power of the Spirit, on the motion principle of the sky. The secret of his magic power is that he can make suitable combinations of time elements. Well-dignified Skill, adaptation, constructive power, initiative, subtlety. Ill-dignified Craft, the power of sense-illusion, lying, deception, cunning. 2, La Papesse The keys in the Knapp version repeat Oswald Wirth’s variation from the older symbolism. They do not belong properly to this card. The lunar crescent surmounting her crown identifies La Papesse as the Tarot symbol of the Moon. The symbol of Mercury on her breast suggests that she reflects the power of the preceding Key, just as the subconscious mind, whose principal power is memory, is responsive and reflective in all its activities, which are controlled from the Mercurial, or self-conscious, level. Meanings The divinatory meanings are the same as those of the Moon in astrology: Fluctuation, reaction, change, alternation, increase and decrease, instability, secrets, things hidden, the unrevealed future, Whether these meanings are good or evil depends altogether upon the dignity of the card in the divinatory layout."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"56 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps 3, L’Imperatrice Even Papus, who was led astray by the mistaken attribution of the major trumps to the Hebrew alphabet, perceived that L’Imperatrice is a symbol of Venus. Well-dignified The divinatory meanings of the card all correspond to the astrological significance of that lovely planet. They include: Fruitfulness, Beauty, luxury, pleasure, success and happiness. Ill-dignified But if the card is very badly placed in the layout it is like the afflicted Venus in astrology, and then signifies Dissipation, lust, waste of time and substance in pleasure, laziness and sensuality. 4, L’Empereur This card, corresponding to the letter Heh, first of the 12 simple letters, is related to the Martian sign, Aries. As Mars represents the basic force in Aries, we can see why the card corresponding to this sign bears a title which implies that its central figure is the consort of L’Imperatrice. For in mythology and in astrology, Venus and Mars are closely related, even as imagination (Venus) and action (Mars), act and react upon each other. Furthermore, in the astrological signs, Aries, the home of Mars, directly follows Pisces, the sign in which Venus is exalted. Well-dignified Mental energy; foresight, supervision, oversight, control; reason, persistence, determination; ambition, leadership, enthusiasm. Ill-dignified Strife, anger, tendency to go to extremes; over-active; lack of discretion."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"57 5, Le Pape This card corresponds to the letter Vau, and to the sign Taurus, the attribution being that given in the Book of Formation . In this connection it may {be} of interest to note that the name of the first Pope was Simon, or Simeon, which in Hebrew means “hearing.” Hearing is also attributed to the letter Vau in Qabalah, and Taurus, according to astrology, rules the neck, throat and ears, so that this sign is directly connected with those parts of the human body which establish communication by means of speech. “LE PAPE” means literally “The Father,” and in the technical language of the Qabalah the name “Father” is particularly associated with the idea of Wisdom. Meanings Thus the divinatory meanings of this Key correspond to these fundamental notions: Divine Wisdom; intuition; explanation, teaching. It is also a symbol of occult force voluntarily invoked. Of this the symbol of the pentagram is a reminder. 6, L’Amoureux This card represents the letter Zain, and the Mercurial sign Gemini. In accordance with an old misunderstanding the picture in the Knapp design shows an initiate hesitating at the parting of the ways, with Vice on his left hand and Virtue on his right. None of the ancient Tarot cards, not even the exoteric versions, justify this interpretation, and the consequent change of symbolism. In some old Tarots this card is called Marriage , and such is one of its meanings, although the deeper significance is that of the sign Gemini, namely, polarity . Meanings Attraction, beauty, love, sympathy. Balance of forces, and reciprocal activity. Particularly, agreement in things of the mind, symbolized by the six-pointed star, or hexagram. It is a card of harmony between the inner and outer life. 7, Le Chariot This Key stands for the letter Cheth and the sign Cancer. In astrology, Cancer is connected with the fourth house, and so with home, and with the conclusion of a matter in a horary reading. The picture shows a victorious chieftain, resting. The sphinxes, however, in the divinatory aspect of this card, may be understood to indicate some secret relating to the Querant. In general the divinatory aspect of this card, may be understood to indicate some secret relating to the Querant. Meanings Triumph, victory, the successful outcome of a matter. It is also a card of possessions, particularly of lands and houses, and the financial security resulting from such possessions."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"58 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps 11, La Force ( See Lesson 1 , concerning the number of this Key and its relation to the sign Leo). This card corresponds to the Hebrew letter Teth, and thus to the zodiacal sign Leo. It refers, in the magical side of occultism, to the law which is the basis of all human control of occult forces. Meanings Ill-dignified, it may signify ostentation, obstinacy, and the like. often, in material questions, it relates to risky speculation, dangerous adventures, and sometimes to clandestine love-affairs. Much depends upon the dignity of the card in the layout. 9, L’Ermite Corresponds to Yod and the sign Virgo. In its deeper occult meaning this card is closely connected with alchemical symbolism, through the rulership of Mercury in Virgo. Well-dignified Light and guidance from higher realms. Aid from superiors and inferiors. Good for Health. Ill-dignified The Querant will suffer from misunderstanding and isolation; may expect active opposition from superiors and inferiors; may have to engage in unpleasant or menial occupations; and will be in danger of illness. 10, La Roue de Fortune Corresponds to Kaph and the planet Jupiter, the Greater Fortune. Its influence is expansive, helpful, temperate. Well-dignified Good fortune, a turn for the better, happiness. In questions where the Querant is beset by doubts and uncertainties, the solution of those difficulties. Ill-dignified Pride, arrogance, formalism; success turns the head of the person to whom the card particularly applies in the reading. “Pride goeth before a fall” is the clue to the Ill-dignified 10th Key."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"59 8. La Justice ( See No. 11 , above). Corresponds to the letter Lamed, and to the zodiacal sign Libra. Well-dignified Balance, equilibrium, especially emotional stability; good Karma. Is often an indication of successful dealings with the public, and if Well-dignified is favorable in all questions involving legal matters, partnership, or marriage. Ill-dignified It indicates unfavorable relations with partners (marriage or business), trouble in court, emotional instability; sudden changes of plans; bad Karma. 12. Le Pendu The letter corresponding to this card is Mem, to which are attributed the element of Water and the planet Neptune . Meanings In divination, much depends on the nature of the question whenever this card appears in a layout. If the question is concerned with spiritual matters, the Hanged Man represents wisdom, but a wisdom that is just the reverse of what the world commonly accepts. The card also stands for surrender to the inevitable, but in spiritual things this is surrender to the spiritual perception of universal laws, while in material affairs it is involuntary submission to the force of circumstances. In ordinary material affairs Key 12 is a symbol of reverses and losses, of suffering and sacrifice. But much depends upon its position in a layout, and upon whether or not it is well or ill-dignified. 13, La Mort Corresponds, through the letter Nun, to the zodiacal sign Scorpio. Thus it is more or less related to the matters which astrology connects with the eight house of a horoscope, such as death, legacies, the affairs of the dead, and so on. Sometimes it has definite relation to necromancy and spiritualism. Meanings Time, age. Sudden change, wholly unexpected. (For good or ill, according to the dignity of the card in a layout). In material matters, as a rule, it is a symbol of death, either the death of persons, or the failure of a project."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"60 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps 14, La Temperance Connects, through the letter Samekh, with the zodiacal sign Sagittarius. The symbolism of the card is in close relation to many of the divinatory meanings. Meanings Combinations; success in difficult and protracted enterprises; dealings with persons at some distance, or long journeys which will work out for good and ill, according to the placing of the card. A card of management, adaptation and economy. 15, Le Diable Corresponds, through the letter Ayin, with Capricorn. In all but the highest spiritual questions, where the Querant is definitely and consciously on the occult path, this card is of evil significance. In its most general meanings, it signifies Mammon, and thus big business, the conventions of society, the injustice and cruelty of a social order in which money takes the place of God, in which humanity is bestialized, in which war is engineered by greed masquerading as patriotism, in which fear is dominant. Students of astrology will have no difficulty in seeing how this corresponds to Capricorn, the sign of big business, and the sign of worldly fame. Not that Capricorn is evil, but that its lower and negative expression is what has just been mentioned. Meanings Bondage, materiality, force (especially the force of convention and public opinion), fate, necessity. 16, Le Feu du Ciel Corresponds, through the letter Peh, to Mars. The symbolism, which has, for a long time, been connected with the story of the Tower of Babel, has a direct bearing upon the divinatory meanings. Meanings These meanings correspond also to the influence of Mars in astrology. As a rule an evil card, although in spiritual matters it may be understood as symbolizing the overthrow of mistaken conceptions, or the defeat of activities opposed to the Querant's spiritual development. In material affairs it signifies ambition, unforeseen catastrophes, fighting, grave dangers, the ruin of the Querant's plans, the defeat of his hopes."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"61 17, Les Etoiles Corresponds, through the letter Tzaddi, to the sign Aquarius. It is a card which always intimates that the truth of the matter which interests the Querant is to be made manifest. It usually indicates assistance from friends. Well-dignified It promises unexpected help, and the realization of hopes and wishes. Ill-dignified Unreliable friends, a tendency to impracticality or dreaminess on the part of the Querant, loss through acquaintances. 18, La Lune Although this card is named “The Moon,” it is really related to the zodiacal sign Pisces, through the letter Qoph, which corresponds to that sign. Its meanings are, in divination, clearly traceable to the 12th house influence of the sign Pisces. This card is very sensitive to the influence of other cards around it in a layout. Well-dignified Voluntary change, advance into a wider field of activity, but an advance made primarily because the Querant is unhappy in, or dissatisfied with his present position. There is always an element of uncertainty in matters represented by this card. Ill-dignified It stands for error, lying, deception; for limitations resulting from the Querant's own lack of judgement or his want of self-control; for difficulties brought about by the machinations of hidden enemies. 19, Le Soleil Corresponds to the Sun, through the letter Resh. In its higher meanings it is a card of liberation, signifying release from the bondage of lower planes. Meanings In material questions it is usually good, signifying gain, glory, or riches. In general it corresponds to the solar influence in astrology. But if surrounded by very evil cards it may mean vanity, arrogance, prodigality, ostentatious display, and a tendency to intrigue."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"62 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps 20, Le Jugement Corresponds, through the letter Shin, with the element of Fire. Is probably also related to the planet Pluto, and here it may be noted that in certain relations of Tarot symbolism and combination, this Key is definitely associated with the sign Scorpio, which, some astrologers believe, may be the sign ruled by Pluto. Meanings In divination this card often represents the operation of under-currents of force not easily determinable, or the appearance of unexpected elements bearing upon the Querant's problem. Well-dignified A favorable outcome to the matter concerning which the operation is made. Often the renewal of hopes and wishes, or the betterment of conditions after a period of depression. Ill-dignified Especially in legal matters, the decision goes against the Querant, and the outcome is beyond his power to change. Sometimes a card of inheritance. 21, Le Monde Corresponds, through the letter Tau, to the planet Saturn. Its meaning in a divinatory layout depends much on the position of the cards which surround it and their general meaning. Usually it refers to the matter concerning which the question is made. Meanings Well-dignified it signifies success, a favorable issue to the circumstances. Sometimes change of place. Summary In considering the major trumps, much depends upon their position and dignity. In the method of divination you have been practicing up to this point, the zodiacal keys often indicate the time when some event occurs. Whether in the past or in the future depends, of course, on which of the three heaps of cards the Key is located in. Practice is the only thing that will enable you to judge these cards well, but the better you understand their symbols and particularly the fundamental meaning of the planets and signs of the zodiac, the easier will it be to divine. In the next lesson we shall begin explaining a more definite system of divination, which should always be resorted to for the solution of really important questions. In the meantime, continue your practice with the method already explained. When you apply this to the discovery of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"63 general trend of a day’s events, ignore the time-values of the cards representing the signs and decans of the zodiac, and consider only the general significance of those cards. Remember, too, that the pile of cards containing the significator is the only one to be read. In the “morning, afternoon, evening” method, the location of the significator shows which part of the day will be most important for the Querant, but after this is determined, the cards of the pile containing the Significator are to be shuffled, cut once, and then dealt into three heaps, from right to left, of which the first, or right-hand heap is “evening.” The same principle is to be adhered to when the three original piles are called “past, present and future,” but in this case the time-values of the cards should be considered."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"64 Oracle of Tarot Major Trumps"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"65 Lesson 7: Further Stages of Divination THIS lesson begins the explanation of the method of Tarot divination to be used for the more serious problems. The simpler method already explained is to be employed for practice, and for those occasions in which the use of the cards for their higher purposes seems inadvisable, especially those occasions where there are persons present who are more or less sceptical. Remember that the first and most essential point in a real divination is the Querant's earnest desire for help. The second point is that the Querant should clearly formulate his question to himself. The third is that the diviner should mentally invoke the aid of his Higher Self in beginning to divine. No matter what the attitude of the persons present at a divination may be, the diviner himself should always be in earnest. This does not mean that he should put on a heavy, solemn demeanor. In divination, as in everything else connected with the occult arts, the light touch should always be sought, because the light touch is the sure touch. Yet the intention of the diviner must always to help and enlighten those who come to him. To the degree that he thinks of himself as the instrument of a power higher than his limited personality, to that degree will he be of real service. Second Stage of Tarot Divination When the Significator has been found in one of the four piles of cards, as before explained, if the divination is radical, the diviner proceeds as follows: 1. Arrange the cards of the pile containing the Significator in a circle or wheel on the table. Place the Significator at the top of the wheel, but be careful not to alter the sequence of the cards. 2. Count around the wheel, beginning with the Significator, as explained below. Count always from right to left, or counter-clockwise, unless the picture of the Significator faces to the right, as, for example, the King and Queen of Cups, or the Warrior of Swords. When the picture of the Significator faces to the right, and only then, count from left to right, or clock-wise. The counting should always include the card from which you start. Thus, if the Significator be a Servant (S), you count 7, and if the card the count ends with be the 9 or Wands, the next count will be 9, and will commence with the 9 of Wands. For Kings, Queens and Warriors count 4. for Servants or pages, count 7. For Aces count 11. For small cards of minor trumps count the number printed on the card. The counting for major trumps is as follows: For Keys 0, 12 and 20 count 3; for Keys 1, 2, 3, 10, 16, 19 and 21 count 9; for Keys 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18 count 12."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"66 Oracle of Tarot Further Stages of Divination It is permissible to mark the number to be counted on the cards. On the major trumps this may be conveniently placed just below the number of the card. On the minor trumps it may be placed below the index in the upper left-hand corner. 3. As you count, make a story from the meanings of the cards. At first this may be little more than slight elaboration of the meaning of each card, as you come to it in the counting. If you practice faithfully and regularly, it will not be long before you find yourself, as you come to a card, impelled to say something which is by no means restricted to its bare meaning. The main thing is to watch that you do not say anything which runs counter to the basic meaning of the card under consideration. 4. Sooner or later this counting will bring you to a card you have touched before. This card is invariably the most important card at this stage of the operation. Suppose, for example, that your first layout was as follows: Queen of Swords (Significator) 8 of Swords Warrior of Wands 21. Lee Monde 7 of Coins 8. La Justice Warrior of Coins 11. La Force Begin to count with the Significator, here the Queen of Swords. Count 4 to the left, ending the count at Key 8, La Justice. Continue the count in the same direction, counting 12, and ending at the 7 of Coins. The third count begins with the 7 of Coins and ends with Key 11, La Force. The fourth count begins with Key 11, from which you count 12, and ending with the Warrior of Wands. The fifth count begins with the Warrior of Wands, counting 4, and ends with Key 21, Le Monde. Beginning with Key 21 and counting 9 brings you back to Key 21 and ends the counting. Thus, in this layout, Key 21 is the most important card. N.B. In counting around the wheel, always keep going in the direction you started. Thus, in the example above, you would not reverse the direction of the count on coming to Key 8, although the woman printed on that Key seems, in this position in the layout, to be facing opposite to the direction of the count."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"67 5. Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. This will enable you to continue your story, filling in details omitted as you went round the circle. In the example above the first pair would be the Warrior of Wands and the 8 of Swords; the second pair would be the 7 of Coins and Le Monde; the third pair would be the Warrior of Coins and La Justice. This would leave Key 11, La Force at the bottom of the wheel, to be paired with the Significator at the top. In reading these pairs, no matter which way the Significator faces, nor which way the counting has run, the card on the right of the diviner is invariably related to the past, and that on the left to the future. When the pairs come out even, so that there is no single card at the bottom of the wheel, opposite the Significator, the solution of the Querant's problem depends largely on the interaction of forces surrounding him, and not so much upon his own will, thought or action. But when a single card is left over, as above, this Key represents a force, condition, or person apparently opposed to the Significator, but really standing as the basis of his action, or the raw material for his work. At this stage of the divination the two stories may not be quite accurate. One reason for this is that the Querant does not, as a rule, know everything about the matter. But the main outlines should be such as the Querant can recognize. If not, abandon the divination at this point, and wait for another occasion. If the two stories develop enough of the question to warrant continuing, proceed with Third Stage of Tarot Divination 1. The diviner shuffles, and the Querant cuts the cards once, as before. 2. The diviner deals all the cards, face down, into 12 packs, thus: 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 11 10 9 8 7 These 12 packs correspond to the 12 astrological houses of heaven."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"68 Oracle of Tarot Further Stages of Divination 3. Turn up the packs, one by one, until you find that one which contains the Significator. Judge the general nature of the further development of the question by the nature of the house in which the Significator appears. Thus, if the Significator falls in the First House (pack 1), the further development of the matter will depend largely upon the Querant himself, upon his own initiative, or upon his own action. But if the Significator should fall in the Tenth House, the further development of the Question would be concerned with the Querant's profession, with matters making for or against his promotion, or the attainment of some degree of influence or fame. If other indications pointed that way, and the Significator were in the 10th house, the further development of the question might be concerned with the Querant's father, or with some man of prominence and authority whose influence might work for the Querant, or against him, according to the indications of the layout. The Dignities of the cards are very important in this third stage of the divination. No attention is paid to the “accidental dignity” indicated hitherto by the card’s being rightside-up or upside- down. The dignities are all based upon the astrological significance of the cards. Students familiar with astrology will understand at once why Key 19, corresponding to the Sun, is Well- dignified in the First House and Ill-dignified in the Seventh House. They will see, too, that Key 4, L’Empereur, which represents Aries, is naturally Well-dignified in the First House, but Ill- dignified in the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Houses, which are in adverse aspect to the First House in a “natural chart.” Those who know nothing of astrology will not so easily understand the why of these dignities, but they will, if they practice, soon come to recognize the accuracy of what is given below. Meanings of the Houses The meanings of the 12 houses, and the powers of the cards therein are: First House The Querant himself; his life, personality, disposition, personal outlook; his own initiative and action.

Shuffle the entire pack, as before, and let the Querant cut once. 2. Deal out the entire pack one card at a time for the 12 signs of the zodiac. The cards should be dealt face-down, as in the preceding stage of the divinatory. 3. Turn up the packs, until you find the Significator, beginning with pack 1, or Aries. The time- period represented by that pack, and the general meaning of the sign of the zodiac it represents, will be of greatest importance in relation to the question. Determining the Time Period Suppose, for example, the Significator is found in the third pack. This corresponds to the third sign, Gemini, and thus to the time-period between May 21st and June 20th. Whether it refers to past or future depends wholly upon the time of year in which the divination is made. The rule for this is as follows: At the fourth stage of divination, if the pack containing the significator represents the same time-period as that in which the divination is made, it is regarded as relating to the present. If it represents a time-period not more than three months prior to the time of the divination, it relates to the past. Otherwise it relates to the future. [This paragraph is in all caps in the original.] An Example We will suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the cards in this Gemini pack are Queen of Swords (Significator); 3. L’Imperatrice; 4 of Coins; 15. Le Diable; 5 of Swords; 7 of Cups; 11. La Force. The Significator herself is Well-dignified in Gemini, because she represents a person of the airy triplicity (and has been chosen on that account). Key 3, L’Imperatrice is fortunate, for it represents the influence of Venus, the Lesser Fortune, and Venus in Gemini suggests pleasure and profit from travel, writings, and all other Mercurial pursuits. The 4 of Coins is not Ill- dignified in this layout, for there is no real conflict of forces between its time-period and that of Gemini. But the next card 15. Le Diable, is unfortunate in anything but purely material questions. On the other hand, the better meanings of the 5 of Swords suit are Well-dignified in airy signs. The 7 of Cups has merely its ordinary power in this layout, yet this is strengthened by the card that follows it, for Key 11 is strong in all airy signs but Aquarius."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"74 Oracle of Tarot Fourth Stage of Divination In reading the layout, the same method of counting is used as before. Thus, in the example given, the first count is 4, from the Queen of Swords to the 15th major trump. This indicates restriction, obstacles and difficulties for the Querant, connected either with travel or with Mercurial pursuits. Possibly great difficulty in arriving at a decision between two possible courses of conduct. The next count of 12, beginning with the 15th Key, brings us back to the Significator. Thus the clear indication is that the obstacle is mental , and that it is within the Querant's own mental life that the solution must be sought. Pairing the Cards Now, pairing the cards, as in the preceding stages of the operation, we have Key 11, La Force, indicating that in the time prior to the divinatory the Querant has power sufficient to overcome her difficulties, and imagination and inventiveness sufficient to apply that power so as to procure excellent results. The next pair is of 7 of Cups and 4 of Coins. The former probably means that the Querant, though fairly successful in the past, has lacked definiteness and decision in making her plans; or, that she has not followed up her successes vigorously enough, so that she had less advantage from what she gained in the past than she might have had, but for some indecision of indolence. The 4 of Coins, paired with the 7 of Cups, and in the position referring to the future, indicates the need of wisely managing all material resources. It indicates activity in money matters, and suggests the need of tact. The third, and last pair in this group is the 5 of Swords and Key 15. The 5 of Swords is well- dignified in Gemini , hence, although it means trouble, it is here a symbol of power gained from trouble, and this power will enable the Querant to meet her problem and work it out successfully. An Important Note In this operation, and in the one that precedes it, the first six piles of cards, corresponding to the houses from 1 to 6, or to the signs from Aries to Virgo, will always contain 7 cards, because there are only 78 cards in the Tarot pack. And the last six packs will contain only 6 cards. Hence, if the Significator falls in any of the first six packs, the pairing will be as follows: SIGNIFICATOR Future (Mind) Past Future (Desires) Past Future (Conditions) Past"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"75 But if the Significator is in any of the last six packs the pairing will be as follows: SIGNIFICATOR Future (Mind) Past Future (Desires) Past Synthesis (Conditions) — That is to say, in reading Houses or Signs, when you come to pair the cards, the first pair always relates to the Querant's mental states; the second pair is more concerned with the Querant's desires, feelings, or emotions. The third pair (if there be 7 cards in the layout) relates to the external conditions. If there be only 6 cards in the layout, the single card which pairs with the Significator is the synthesis of past and future conditions, and will usually be found to relate more particularly to the present, so far as time is concerned, although it must be remembered that the present sums up to the past, and affects the conditions of the future, so that a single card in this position looks, so to say, both ways. The Time Element This is the most difficult to judge, and only experienced diviners are likely to be accurate in it. But even experienced diviners were not always experienced, hence the student should always attempt to judge time, and then carefully check the success or failure of his attempts. There are, however, certain principles to be considered and acted upon. 1. In questions of a very ephemeral nature, such as relate to the affairs of what is practically the present or the immediate future, the pack in which the Significator falls may be understood to represent the time-period in which the Moon will be passing through the sign represented by that pack. Thus, in the example given, the pack corresponds to Gemini, and if the divination were made on January 3rd, 1934, the time might be read as having to do with the next passage of the Moon through Gemini. Reference to an ephemeris for 1934 will show that on January 3rd of that year the next passage of the Moon through Gemini will occur on the 25th and 26th days of the same month. 2. In questions where the operation of the forces is likely to be slower, the Sun’s position in the sign is to be taken as indicating the time-period, subject to the rule given in “Determining the Time Period,” above."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76 Oracle of Tarot Fourth Stage of Divination 3. In a divination which concerns only the affairs of a single day, the sign occupied by the Significator in this fourth operation refers to the period of the day during which that sign ascends over the Eastern horizon. Roughly speaking, the sign ascending at sunrise is the same as that in which the Sun is placed, and every two hours thereafter a new sign ascends, in the regular order of the zodiac. Hence, if the divination we are considering had been limited to the affairs of January 3rd, 1934, when the Sun is in Capricorn this fourth stage of the operation, relating to the sign Gemini, would be concerned with the approximate time-period between the tenth & twelfth hour after sunrise on that day. This is only a rough calculation, and students who are desirous of developing accuracy in this respect should learn the comparatively simple astrological method for determining the time of day when a sign is on the ascendant at the place where the divination is performed . 4. The time-value of the card which represents the future condition in the fourth stage of the divinatory operation is also important. In the example we were using, this card is Key 15. Le Diable. And if the divination were performed on January 3rd, 1934, this Key, which represents Capricorn, would relate to present time, so far at the Sun’s position is concerned, or to that part of the immediate future corresponding to the period between the 3rd of January, when the divination is made, and the 21st of January, when the Sun leaves Capricorn and enters Aquarius. When the time-value of this final card of the fourth stage of the divination corresponds to a period of the year which is past at the time the divination is performed, the card usually relates to the next period in which the Moon passes through the sign corresponding to the card. Thus if this same example occurred in a divination made in the latter part of February, 1934, say on the 23rd of that month, Le Diable would probably refer to the time-period corresponding to the 9th, 10th and 11th of March, since the Moon will be passing through Capricorn on those days. 5. When the final card of this fourth operation is a planetary card, and therefore has no definite time-value, its operation is to be judged as follows: 1. In very ephemeral questions it represents the time of day when the first sign ruled by that planet is rising. Thus if the divination were made on the 3rd of January, and Key 3, L’Imperatrice were in this final position in the layout, the condition it represented would refer to the time of day when Taurus, the first Venusian sign after Capricorn, was in the Ascendant for that day. 2. In questions whose solution is expected in the near future, the same Key, on January 3rd, 1934, would refer to the time in which the Moon was passing through Taurus, or, in this instance, to the period between the 22nd and 23rd of January, 1934."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"77 3. In questions whose solution may take longer than those included in the preceding paragraph, the time-period relates to the time when the Sun is in the next sign ruled by the planet in question. Thus, if the divination were made when the Sun was in Capricorn, and L’Imperatrice were the final card, it would refer to the time-period when the Sun entered and passed through Taurus, or the period from April 20th to May 20th of that year. 6. When the final card is an Ace or a Page, the time-period refers in very ephemeral questions to the time of day during which the three signs controlled by that card are ascending; in less ephemeral questions to the period during which the Moon is passing through those three signs; in questions where the solution will take considerable time, to the period when the Sun is passing through those three signs. 7. The same principle applies when the final card is one of the other court-cards (King, Queen or Warrior). In ephemeral questions the time-period is that part of the next day when the signs represented by the card are ascending; in questions having to do with the immediate future the time-period is that of the next passage of the Moon through the signs; in questions concerned with the more remote future, the time-period is to be judged by the next passage of the Sun through the signs. The only book required for determining these time-periods is an ephemeris for the current year. The daily paper usually gives the time of sunrise, and this is accurate enough to judge the time-period of ascending signs for divination."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"78 Oracle of Tarot Fourth Stage of Divination"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"79 Lesson 9: Fifth Stage of Divination 1. Shuffle the entire pack, and let the Querant cut once, as before. 2. Turn the cards face up in your left hand, and run through the pack, without disturbing the order of any of the cards, until you come to the card you have selected as Significator. Put all the cards preceding this one, as you have run through the cards, at the back of the pack, without disturbing their order. That is, cut the pack at the Significator, so that this will be the top card when the pack is turned face up. 3. Place this card on the table. 4. Deal the next thirty-six cards in a ring around him, beginning at the usual position of the sign Aries, or of the First House, in a zodiacal wheel. The first three cards dealt will represent the three decanates of Aries; the next three the three decanates of Taurus, and so on through the twelve signs. 5. Judge each card as it is placed on the table, according to its agreement or disagreement with the position in which it falls. Key 4, L'Empereur, for example, would be Well-dignified anywhere in the first group of three cards. So would any card of the Wands suit, and any card of the Swords suit except those representing the three decanates of Libra; those representing the three decanates of Cancer, and those representing the three decanates of Capricorn (in the Cups and Coins suits respectively) would also be Ill-dignified in Aries. In general the strength or weakness of any card will be practically the same as those given on pages 27, 28 and 29. 6. After the cards have been judged and read as above, count (beginning with the first point in Aries, or the first card following the Significator) and pair as in preceding stages of the divination. Note carefully in which division of the zodiac the final card appears. N.B. The pairing, in this stage, is across the wheel , that is card 1 with card 19, card 2 with card 20, card 3 with card 21, and so on. The final card referred to above is not card 36 (or the one corresponding to the last decanate of the twelfth sign, Pisces). It is the card to which the counting returns, that is, the card which shows up a second time as the result of counting, and so brings the counting to an end."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"80 Oracle of Tarot Fifth Stage of Divination 7. As in the preceding stage of divination, judge the time represented by this final card as relating to the corresponding ascending sign in a question that refers to the day following the divination. If the question is one that has to do with a problem in which a solution is desired within a comparatively short time, look in the current ephemeris for the next passage of the Moon through the decanate of the sign in which the final card falls. Otherwise consider the final card as applying to an event or condition which will become manifest when next the Sun passes through the decanate of the sign in which the final card is placed. Further As To Dignities Of The Cards These remarks apply particularly to this layout of 36 cards, although they have some bearing on all stages of the operation. 1. In considering the strength or weakness of any card, consider what cards are next it on either side. Cards of the same suit strengthen it for good or evil, according to their nature. Similarly, major trumps on either side of a minor trump strengthen or weaken the latter, according to their nature. But minor trumps have less effect on major trumps. Wands are friendly with Swords and Pentacles. Wands are inimical to Cups. Cups are friendly with Swords and Coins. Swords are friendly with Cups and Wands. Swords are inimical to Coins. 2. When a card falls between two others which are of contrary nature, or inimical to each other, it is not much affected by either. For example, if the Ace of Wands should fall between Key 7, the Chariot and Key 8, La Justice, it would not be very much affected. Neither would it be greatly affected if there were a card of the Sword suit on one side, and a card of the Coins suit on the other. 3. A greater number of one suit or the other in this fifth stage of the operation has a particular relevance:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"81 A majority of this suit or card... ...shows this. Wands there will be much mental energy expended in the matter. Many wands also portend some opposition to the Querant, and possible quarrels. Cups intensifies the emotional element present in the solution of the question. In general, many cups in a layout intimate pleasure, social activity, merriment. Swords a portent of sickness, sadness, trouble, or death. Coins the emphasis in the reading will be on business, money or possessions. Major Trumps an intimation that strong forces are at work in the matter under consideration. These are usually beyond the Querant's control, whether for good or evil. Court Cards the influence of persons other than the Querant will be exerted in the shaping and decision of the matter. They also intimate that the Querant will be a good deal in the company of others, or at social gatherings. Aces Strength. 4.

By this time you should be fairly familiar with the meanings of all the cards. In studying them, begin always with the keywords as given in the lesson on the four suits and the twenty-two major trumps. It is absolutely impossible to divine at all satisfactorily until the significance of the entire pack is thoroughly learned. Spend at least half-an-hour every day with the Tarot. Shuffle the cards, cut them at random, and run through the whole pack. Lay out the cards in rows on the table, and practice making sentences from the various sequences. You must first saturate yourself with tarot, so that you do not have to spend any time in trying to recall what a card is supposed to mean. If possible, do this work with a friend. Blending Astrology with the Tarot The better you understand the underlying astrological principles governing Tarot divination, the sooner will you become a proficient diviner. To this end, there is no better low-priced book than The Student’s Chart Reader , published by Llewellyn George at 8921 National Boulevard (Palms), Los Angeles, Cal. The price of this little book in paper is only $1.00, or $1.50 in cloth. It can be had from us, or direct from the publisher. Its use in connection with the stage of the Tarot divination just explained is as follows: Suppose that in the first section of the wheel containing 36 cards there were Key 14, Temperance, the King of Swords, and the Servant of Wands. The position of the first of these would specifically relate it to the first ten degrees of Aries, which have a Martian quality; and the quality of Key 14 itself is that of its ruler, Jupiter. Thus the first card would be the same as the astrological influence of Jupiter in the first decanate of Aries. This is explained on page 43 of the book just mentioned. The second card in the series would represent, in the main, the influence of the sign Libra, and thus the active force of Venus. Venus in Aries is explained on page 23 of the little book. The third card is itself a symbol of the whole sign Aries, and of the two signs following. Its position in the 3rd decanate of Aries would confirm the suggestion represented by the presence of Key 14 in the first decanate. The same book also gives the significance of the various planets in the 12 houses, and as every card of the Tarot represents either a planet itself, a sign of the zodiac ruled by a planet, or a decanate of the zodiac under the sub-ruler-ship of a planet, there is a sense in which every card represents some aspect of planetary force, and may therefore be read as a planetary influence in a given sign or house. So learn the meanings. Then it will be easy to combine them."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"83 Lesson 10: Final Stage of Divination 1. Shuffle, and let the Querant cut once, as before. 2.

The pile in which it falls will determine the general outcome of the question, and will color the meaning of all the cards found in that pile. 4. The better you understand the fundamental meanings of the numbers from 1 to 10, the more satisfactory will be this part of the reading. To master the ultimate significance of the ten numbers is to become an adept in the Qabalah, and this requires years of study and meditation. But for the purposes of divination, a thorough grasp of what follows in this lesson will give you a good practical foundation."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"84 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination The Number 1 The vertical line connects height and depth , and is therefore a symbol of that which links together the extremes of Spirit (Height) and Matter (Depth); of Superconsciousness (Height) and Subconsciousness (Depth). The vertical line is also particularly the symbol of man , standing upright on the earth. Among the meanings of the number are: Beginning, initiative, originality, unity, singleness, isolation, and the like. In Hebrew occultism 1 is called the Crown , to show that it represents the determining, ruling, directive and volitional aspect of consciousness; hence the Crown is termed also the Primal Will . The same philosophy also terms 1 the Hidden Intelligence, to show that the primary mode of consciousness is concealed behind all veils of name and form. In Qabalah, again, 1 is the specific number of Jechidah (IChIDH) the Self or I AM, and of that primary activity in the universe whence all other forms of energy and force are derived, known as The Beginning of the Whirlings . Keywords Beginning, Control, Force, Consciousness, and Selfhood."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"85 The Number 2 Duality, polarity; association, coexistence, partnership; duplication, doubling, repetition, succession, rhythm; likeness, similitude, reflection, reproduction; receptivity, secondariness, dependence, connection; alternation, reciprocation; mutuality, interconnection, interdependence; periodicity, pulsation, vibration; round, revolution, rotation—are some fundamental meanings of the number 2. In the Hebrew Wisdom this number is called, in the cosmic sense, Masloth , “the highway of the stars,” that is, the Sphere of the Zodiac, or Sphere of the Fixed Stars. The idea here is that the number 2 represents the reflection of the invisible Life- Energy of the number 1 in the regular rhythmic movement of the heavenly bodies. Note, too, that the root-meaning of Zodiac is “Living.” The idea here is that the manifest movements we see in the heavens are the duplication or reflection of the invisible activities of the Primal Will. This is important, for it indicates that behind the whirling motion of the heavenly bodies, behind the succession of their positions and aspects, is something higher. The Sphere of the Zodiac is secondary , not primary. With the number 2, again, the Hebrew Wisdom associates the notion of Wisdom, which is regarded as the reflection of the Self. Wisdom is the perfect self- recognition of the I AM, the mirror in which the Self is reflected to itself. Wisdom is revealed to us by the celestial order, and the true astrology which gives us the meaning of that order is the basis of all human wisdom. Hence 2 is known also as the Illuminating (literally Shining ) Intelligence . The Hebrew original also carries the significance of mental enlightenment or instruction, and reminds us that 2 has always been called the number of Science. Furthermore, this original Hebrew word refers to the idea of admonishing or warning. All this ties up with the connection between 2 and the Zodiac. The stars do literally enlighten us, for they are suns, the source of all our light. The rhythmic order of their motion is the manifestation of the Hidden Order and power of the original Whirling Motion signified by 1. From the study of that order we gain wisdom to direct our lives. Finally, the energy which streams from the heavenly bodies (including that heavenly body, the Earth, which is our own abode) is the vital force of our own organisms, hence we find that the Qabalah designates the number 2 as the specific symbol of the Life-Force in man and in all creatures; and this force, of course, is that which is most highly concentrated in the power of continuing the species, characteristic of all living things, so that this idea ties up directly with the abstract meaning of 2 as relating to reproduction. Keywords Wisdom, Universal order, Reflection, Vitality."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"86 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination The Number 3 The number 1 represents, geometrically, the Point which is the beginning of all manifestation. The number 2 represents the line, or extension of the activity of the Point. The number 3 is related to the Surface, or plane in which the motion of the Line generated from the initial activity of the Point becomes manifest. Again, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, and therefore combines their meanings. As 2 is duplication, reproduction and manifestation, while 1 is original force, initiative and will, it becomes evident that 3 must stand for the actual outworking of the principles reflected from 1 by 2. In Hebrew philosophy 3 is Understanding, which is regarded as looking forward into the field of manifestation, in contrast to Wisdom (2), which is regarded as looking back toward the self-knowledge of the original I AM (1). Understanding (3) is the concrete application of abstract Wisdom (2). Note that adjective “concrete.” It represents the definite and specific in contradistinction to the vague, indefinite and general. That is concrete which has specific outlines, qualities, or properties. It is particular. It is itself , and not something else. Behind all these ideas is the thought of specific Limitation, the notion of outline, form, boundary and so on. And this idea of limitation, coherence, aggregation, consolidation, etc. is just exactly what is meant in astrology by the power designated as Saturn, the power of condensation, limitation and restriction. Thus we see why the number 3, in Qabalah, is called the Sphere of Saturn. (But here we need to remember that the “sphere” of any power or force is not that force itself. 3 is not the number of the planet Saturn, but the number of the field in which Saturn operates). In English, by derivation, Understanding and Substance are literal equivalents, and they have the same meaning in Hebrew. Thus 3 is the symbol of the actual Material or Substance out of which all forms are constructed, and is therefore called AIMA the Mother in the Qabalah. In all esoteric systems we find more or less clearly expressed the idea that original Substance is eternally pure, and this thought is connected with the various myths of a heavenly or earthly Virgin. The root-thought is that the fundamental Substance or Seed- Ground of manifestation (which the thought-habits of all mankind force us to think of as feminine) is something consecrated and holy, something pure and inviolable. Thus the idea of Sanctifying Intelligence is connected with the number 3 in the Hebrew Wisdom, to convey the idea that through growth or expression (symbolized by 3) is brought about the perfected manifestation of the potencies latent in the originating power. Perfect expression of the potencies of life brings about perfected organism, and perfected organism makes possible the expression of perfected consciousness. All organic growth and development are therefore connected with the number 3, and in the larger aspects of life-unfoldment, this number stands for the perfect evolution of organisms which shall be adequate vehicles of expression for the divine Life. Furthermore, the occult theory of evolution is that organic change is the consequence of impulses originating within the organism. In a certain sense, the occult teaching holds that what brings about the effort which ultimately results in specific alterations of physical structure, is the living creature’s intuitive knowledge that such a change is possible. The intuition may be very vague and indefinite, hardly more than a blind urge, at the beginning of an evolutionary process; but as the creature who feels this urge responds to it with effort towards realization,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"87 the very changes in the organism which follow that effort make the intuition more and more definite. At last the time comes when, as in men and women of real enlightenment, this urge toward improvement is clearly understood, and definitely referred to the influence of a power higher than the mere personality. Hence we can see why the Qabalists refer the number 3 to Neshamah, the spiritual “breathing” or Higher Soul, which they regard as the source of Intuition.

The Number 4 Geometrically 4 is the square, composed of equal lines forming rectangles. The use of the square in building from ancient times has made this number representative of the employment of right lines in construction, so that 4 and ORDER are fundamental associations of our thinking. Even our figure 4 shows a combination of the T-square and triangle, familiar implements of the architect and builder. As 1 plus 3, 4 conveys the thought of the organic development of forms (3) expressing the original Life-power (1). As the duplication of 2 it conveys the idea of the reproduction and continuance of Wisdom. Both types of association are connected with the esoteric meanings of 4. The literal meaning of the Hebrew word Tzedek, (which is associated with 4 because 4 is said to be the Sphere of Jupiter, and the Hebrew name for Jupiter is Tzedek) is justness, accuracy, correctness. Here it is curious to note that the first letter of Tzedek (which is spelt T z DK in Hebrew) has the value 90, suggesting the number of degrees in a right angle; that the second letter ( D ) has the value of 4. Hence 4 as the Sphere of Jupiter refers to a field of activity which is the scene of adjustment, right proportion, the correct measurement of forces, the true appraisal of materials. Readers of these pages who are familiar with astrology will see how truly all this fits in with the fundamental meanings of Jupiter. Jupiter is said to be the planet of reason. He signifies judges, bankers, theologians; also science, law and reason. Well-dignified, he inclines those whom he influences to be generous, truthful, honest, moral, reasonable, sincere and upright. Jupiter, furthermore is ceremonious and inclines to good manners, to the correct performance of the ritual of human association. His relation to 4 considered as the duplication of 2 is that the development and classification of the materials of science is furthered by the scientists’ inspection and consideration of the meaning of their finding. In a sense Science feeds upon itself (as the symbol of the serpent biting its own tail intimates). Science gathers facts from the observation of nature, but the advance of science is not limited to the consideration of these objective facts. Quite as much progress is made when scientists turn from considering objective things to careful inspection of the classifications and categories of their various special fields. Thus Neptune and Uranus were discovered by this"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"88 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination means, and the new discoveries of chemical elements have been hastened since Mendeleef compiled his tables. All this will prepare you to understand why the Qabalists called 4 the Measuring Intelligence . The original Hebrew adjective conveys the notion of fixation, steadiness, regularity. But it also is related to a root meaning to curve, to bend, to be arched, and thus to contain, hence 4 is also called the Receptacular Intelligence or the Receiving Intelligence . Here again there is a hint of the doubling of the ideas represented by the number 2. Finally, 4 is called Mercy or Beneficence in the Hebrew Wisdom, and this is clearly enough related to the astrological ideas connected with Jupiter, the Greater Fortune. And since 4 represents the duplication of Wisdom, it is associated with memory in Qabalistic psychology. The Life-power remembers perfectly. It knows its own potencies, its own resources, and also knows perfectly the needs of every one of Its centers of expression. It is limitless in power and substance, and cannot be supposed to fail. Hence it must be beneficent. But its “good-givingness” cannot be otherwise than orderly. It is never wasteful prodigality. All the gifts of God are measured out, even when the measure is full, pressed down, and running over. Every center of expression receives, always exactly what is coming to it Keywords Order, Regularity, Righteousness; Truth, Reason; Co-Ordination, Measurement, Arrangement, Assortment, Allotment, Distribution; Organization, Classification, Systematization, Codification. The Number 5 As representing the sum of 1 and 4 it may be taken to represent the consequence of the codification (4) of the powers of the Primal Will (1); as being the consequence of the reasoned measurement (4) of the impulses of the Origination Energy of the universe (1). Such codification of the best of human knowledge as to the sources of our power, as to the laws of life, as to the potencies of our being has, as its consequence, the body of knowledge embracing philosophy, theology and metaphysics. This body of knowledge is the substance of religion. It is the aggregate of the self-revelation of Spirit to human consciousness. And it is in this sense that the number 5 represents religion, both in its exoteric forms and in its esoteric inner substance. As representing the sum of 2 and 3, the number 5 may be taken to represent the consequence of the working of Wisdom (2) upon Understanding (3), whereby the multiplying and manifesting power of Understanding gives definite form to the more abstract principles of Wisdom. Here, too, we have the Life-force (2) working itself out into manifestation through Intuition (3). Hence, in this connection, 5 may be regarded as peculiarly the number which represents the processes whereby wise knowledge of nature’s hidden laws and forces comes to be part of human consciousness. Considered as the middle term between 1 (beginning) and 9 (completion), the number 5 is a symbol of meditation, adaptation, agency, and the like."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"89 In the astrology of the Qabalah, the number 5 is called Madim , the Sphere of Mars, and it has also the names Pachad , Fear; Geburah , Strength or Severity; and Deen , Justice. Again let me remind you that 5 is not Mars itself, but the sphere or field of the Mars activity. Astrologically Mars represents force, strength, courage and activity. Mars rules the muscular system, and as ruler of Scorpio, has much to do with the force of reproduction. Now, just as 3 is in a sense the manifestation of 2, or concrete development of 2, so is 5 the manifestation or concrete development of 4. It is the consequence of the abstract order symbolized by 4. It is, so to say, that Order transferred from the sphere of abstract principle to the field of concrete application. It is the Cosmic Order perceived by Reason as that Order actually operates in the field of human activity and experience. Primitive man, encountering that order at work in the world around him, does not even dream that the events of his daily experience are expressions of order, much less of truth and beneficence. He fears his environment, and transfers that fear to whatever mysterious beings he imagines to be the causes of what happens around him. Thus, for the primitive mind, the religious aspect of the number 5 is truly expressed by the word Pachad , Fear. More highly-evolved mentalities see the regularity and order of the universe, and learn, to some extent, that knowledge of the cosmic order puts power in the hands of him who possesses it. Such men see the world around them as a veritable Sphere of Mars, in which the fittest and strongest survive. Unless there be a touch of spiritual intuition in the consciousness of such men, they will never see the universe as other than a power source, ruled by inexorable laws, which may be utilized by the man who knows them, to dominate the rest of humanity, and control the forces of nature. This level of consciousness in relation to the number 5 is expressed by the word Geburah , Strength or Severity. Higher spiritual intuition, however, enables those who possess it to recognize the truth that the manifested Order of the universe cannot conceivably be other than perfect Justice. To such minds the number 5 becomes the symbol of the high types of adaptation and adjustment by which a man brings himself into perfect harmony with the real tendencies and purposes of universal activity. In this connection, note that 5 for Qabalists is the number of “personal will,” representing that feeling of tension within the personality which accompanies the making of choices or decisions. All choice and decision, it will be observed, has for its object some particular adaptation of the conditions of the chooser’s environment. (Here we include in environment all the conditions of the mental and emotional life, the states of which appear to the person observing them as being just objective, if apparently less substantial, as are the things and conditions outside his body. The particular aspect of intelligence associated with 5 by Qabalists is called the Radical Intelligence . The original Hebrew means “original, rooted.” It calls up the picture of the great tap-root of a tree, and reminds us that the tap-root is the means or agency whereby the tree"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"90 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination adapts the chemical conditions of the soil to its requirements, and the means also, by which it holds itself firm and upright. The root is a source of contact and a source of sustenance, but most important of all, a source of adaptation and specialization, a source of power and strength. In one of the Hebrew books of occultism, it is said that the Radical Intelligence emanates from the depths of the primordial Wisdom. Now, Wisdom is 2, the Sphere of the Zodiac, and the field of the cosmic Life-force. Hence here is a hint that 5 is somehow to be regarded as specially related to the number 2; a suggestion that whatever we find explicitly expressed by 5 we may also find implicitly present in 2. I speak of this in order to remind you that in the Major trumps of Tarot, 2 is the number of La Papesse while 5 is the number of Le Pape. On the practical side, 5 represents Applied Science in all its variations, including magic, the ceremonial part of religion, but most important of all, the ritualization of daily life . And correct ritualization of daily life means, basically, the correct synchronization of personal action with the rhythmic alternation of forces represented by the movement of the planets through the zodiac. The “highways of the stars” telegraph to us the symbolic messages whereby we may know the will of our Father in Heaven. To decipher the message, and live in accordance with it, is true religion, perfect wisdom, and applied science that links human conduct with the very tap-root of cosmic vitality and order. Keywords Adaptation, Adjustment, Equilibration; Agreement, Union, Conformity; Discipline, Teaching, Training; Variation, Differentiation, Versatility; Magic, Applied Science, Ritual. The Number 6 As 1 plus 5, the number 6 shows the result of the correct ritualization and application of the forces having their origin in the Primal Will. As 2 plus 4, the number 6 becomes the representative of those inner states of consciousness having principally to do with the codification and arrangement (4) of the materials of more or less abstract knowledge and science (2). As 3 plus 3, the number 6 refers to the fact that as soon as there is new development and organization (3), the results so achieved themselves become the subjects or material for the evolutionary process. All these ideas, here but dimly suggested, are to be found explicitly connected with the number 6 in the age-odd symbolic meanings of that number. Its most familiar symbol is the hexagram, or six-pointed star, among plane figures; but the cube, or hexahedron, is its representative among solids. A correct ritualization of the forces originating in the Primal Will (1 plus 5) must needs work itself out in conduct which shall be an accurate and adequate reflection of that Will. Thus the number 6 is regarded by Qabalists as representing the reflection of the Universal Self or Cosmic I AM by the personalized Self, the Ego which is the center of reference for every human being’s experience. And the perfected expression of the number 6, at its very highest level, is, on the one hand, perfect obedience to the Law, and on the other, extraordinary control of external conditions. The truly wise man serves God and masters nature."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"91 Thus he becomes an actual mediator between that which is above him and that which is below. This idea is definitely related to 6 in the Qabalah, which calls 6 the intelligence of mediating influence . To mediate is to stand between, and thus to act as a point of division between two opposite fields of activity. A mediator is an arbitrator between two conflicting parties. Right mediation is therefore right assessment of the respective claims of the two parties, and gives to each what belongs to it. It is in this sense that the number 6 has come to be related to the idea of discrimination. The number itself proceeds directly from the number 2, in this wise; We cannot consider 2 without implying the pre-existence of 1. Therefore 2 really includes the ideas of 1 and 2. The sum of these is 3. Thus, in occult arithmetic, we say that 3 is the “theosophic extension” of 2. Similarly, 3 implies the pre-existence of 2 and 1, so that the theosophic extension of 3 is the sum of 1, 2 and 3, or 6. Hence we say that 6 has its roots in 2. This is hinted at also when one considers the hexagram, which is composed of two equilateral triangles, pointing in opposite directions, yet blended with each other. Similarly the cube, by the perfect equality of opposite faces, conveys the fundamental ideas of the number 6. This number is called Tiphareth, ( T h PART h), Beauty, in the Qabalah, and in the Bible, as in the Qabalah, this word is definitely associated with man , which is also one of the traditional names ( ADM , Adam) of the number 6. Thus in the 13th verse of the 44th Chapter of Isaiah we read: “The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man (in the Hebrew Tiphareth Adam); that it may remain in the house.” This passage is part of a denunciation of idolatry, and refers to the making of an image, or idol. Thus it is in direct connection with the attribution of imagination to the number 6 in Qabalistic psychology. But it has a deeper meaning, and that is why I have introduced it here. The number 6 is also called The Sphere of the Sun, and refers to the field of operation of the ray of the cosmic Self reflected into, or terminating as, the personal Ego. There is a certain strictly true sense in which that which appears to us to be the central point of our personal being, or the central “I” which is the hub around which all things in our experience revolve, may be regarded as none other than this end or the territorial terminus of a stream of vibratory energy having its other end in the actual physical Sun which is the central body of our solar system. The Sun is not a mere mass of flaming gas. It is the body of the controlling Intelligence of our world-system, or perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Sun is the physical organ of that controlling Intelligence. The truly discriminating wise man sees himself and his actions as the terrestrial expressions of impulses and energy originating in the Sun. Such a wise man regards himself, and other human personalities, as being none other than so many different examples of solar intelligence and action . And through a vivid realization of this truth, the wise make themselves true mediators, producing harmony and beauty through their own ritual of life, and inspiring others to copy that ritual."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"92 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination Keywords Balance, Symmetry, Harmony; Beauty, Harmony Of Opposites; Reciprocity, Polarity, Love. The Number 7 Seven is the great sacred number, and to exhaust its occult meanings would require volumes. One most important thing about this number is that it is seldom found in nature. Conventionally, the week has seven days, but the number is only an approximation. The selection of seven as a number to represent musical tones and colors is purely arbitrary. So is the sevenfold classification of the principles of man. And since the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, we know that there is no particular connection between the number 7 and the number of the planets. Neither is there any mathematical way to construct an exact regular heptagon or seven-sided figure. Such a figure can be constructed, but it must be done by trial- and-error, and demands considerable skill of the draftsman. In the Qabalah 7 is named Netzach, a word which is ordinarily translated Victory , but which has often the secondary meaning of Eternity . It is often used as an adjective signifying “perpetual,” or “continual.” It is from this Hebrew name for 7 that many of the occult meanings of the number are derived, such as: Success, mastery; upper hand, whip hand; ascendancy, conquest, triumph. These ideas are clearly suggested by the symbolism of Key 7, Le Chariot. The special mode of consciousness associated in Hebrew Wisdom with 7 is the Occult or Secret Intelligence. The Hebrew word here translated “Occult or Secret” is NST h R , Nesther, from ST h R , Sether, signifying “to shut up, to cover, to hide, to veil, to conceal.” There is a close correspondence of meaning between this particular terminology and the Sanskrit Bupta Vidya , or Secret Wisdom. And if you are at all familiar with modern works on Occultism, particularly with those of H. P. Blavatsky, you will understand that the number 7 is, so to say, the seal of the Secret Doctrine. It is so in the Orient, and equally so in the Occident, for the Western School of Adepts, when they summarized their occult knowledge in the Rosicrucian Fama Fraternitatis gave an elaborate description of a seven-sided building as the key to that strange little book. Again, the Tarot itself is built on a system of sevens . For it is composed of one un-numbered, or Zero, card and 77 or 7 x 11 other cards. The major trumps fall naturally into a scheme of 7s, thus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"93 The minor trumps are 56 in number (7 x 8), and each suit is composed of a double septenary, or 14 cards. Thus this sacred and mysterious number is stamped on the Tarot, which is none other than the ROTA mentioned by the Rosicrucians as one of their most cherished possessions. The number 7 is known also as the Sphere of Venus, and the magic square of 7 x 7, containing 49 cells, is given by Cornelius Agrippa and others as the one which particularly belongs to Venus. Remember here, as elsewhere, that the Sphere of Venus is not to be confused with Venus herself. This Sphere of Venus is said in Qabalistic psychology to be the seat of desire, closely akin to what Hindus call Kama. Keywords Mystery, Occultism, Hidden Wisdom, Secrecy; Rest, Stillness, Quiescence (but not absolute cessation. What is represented is rather a period of quiescence between periods of activity, the rest of the Sabbath, and not the stillness of the grave); Victory, Success, Fulfillment. In the Tarot all the Sevens of the minor trumps indicate, more or less, the temporary cessation of activity. So does Key 7 in the Major Trumps. And when, in the final stage of a divination, the Significator falls in the 7th place on the Tree of Life, the meaning us much the same. If the cards in this final layout are Well-dignified, the suggestion is usually that the Querant will enjoy a well- earned rest. If Ill-dignified, the intimation is that he will be delayed and blocked in his actions, that his desires will be active, but not fruitful. The Number 8 By its form, suggesting a twisted belt, in whose loops wheels would revolve in opposite directions, the number 8 symbolizes the truth that opposite modes of expression (all pairs of opposites) are effects of a single cause. 8 is the digit value of the name IHVH, Jehovah, 888 is the numeration of the name Jesus in Greek, 8 is the “Dominical Number,” or “Number of the Lord” in Christian tradition, and it is the particular number of the “god” named Mercury by Romans, Hermes by Greeks, Nebo by Assyrians, and Thoth by Egyptians. Thus 8 is most definitely the number of Magic and Hermetic Art, the number of supreme attainment. Some shadow of this truth, and of the association of 8 with Mercury, god of commerce, is shown in the attribution of the meaning “big business” to 8 in modern numerology. The form of the figure is derived from the twined serpents of the wand of Mercury ( See Key 1, Le Bateleur , where the juggler holds such a wand in his left hand.) The movement of the hand in writing the number 8 is a rhythmic alternation which suggests action and reaction, and therefore compensation, equation, equalization, coordination, and like ideas. Here we have an image of the alternate cycles of involution and evolution. Rhythm is perhaps one of the most important meanings of 8. All the great forces of nature have their characteristic rhythms, and the great magical secret is related to this truth. Much of the practical work in magic consists in processes whereby the operator attunes certain of his own activities to define cosmic rhythms,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"94 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination so that he vibrates in synchrony with them. A hint of this is given in the major trump entitled Strength, or La Force, which is numbered 8 in the occult Tarot. The Hebrew name of 8 is HVD , pronounced “hode”, and usually written Hod. It is usually translated Splendor , but its root-meaning is prominence or eminence. Thus the root-ideas associated with 8 in the Qabalah are: Distinction, Eminence, Importance; Intensity, Fullness, Greatness; Immensity, Infinity (which is represented in mathematics by the horizontal 8). The mode of consciousness represented by 8 in Qabalah is named the Perfect Intelligence, and the adjective translated “Perfect” is S h LM , rendered in English as “Salem.” It signifies: Whole, entire, perfect; healthy, full of strength; peaceable, friendly. It is noteworthy, too, that a slight variation of the same word, spelt with the same letters, but with different vowel-points, means requital, or recompense, and thus ties in with the idea of compensation suggested by the form of the figure 8. This mode of consciousness is directly connected with the functioning of the self-conscious level of the human mind, personified as Hermes or Mercury, for it is through the functions of this part of our make-up that we discover, classify and utilize the cosmic rhythms. By this means we attain to perfect physical and psychical adjustment, and thus to health of mind and body. And because a perfectly healthy person is self-confident without being egotistic or bumptious, such a person is naturally peaceable. Personal and national ill-health is expressed in irritability, strife and warfare. Persons and nations with healthy minds and bodies keep the peace. 8 is the Sphere of Mercury in the Qabalistic system. The Number 9 As the last of the series of numeral symbols, 9 represents completion, attainment, realization, the goal of endeavor, the end of a cycle. But this completion is not absolute cessation. The end of one cycle is the beginning of another. Every End is the seed of a fresh Beginning. In Hebrew Wisdom, therefore, 9 has from time immemorial been associated with the idea of reproduction. Its Hebrew name is Yesod ( ISVD ), signifying Bias or Foundation . This word is often used to signify commencement or beginning, and thus bears out what was said about 9. Other words related to 9 in this connection are: Ground, support, substratum; fundamental, principle. 9 is also termed the Pure or Clear Intelligence . The Hebrew adjective is THVR , Tahoor, signifying clean, shining, not soiled, pure (as Unalloyed gold). In the metaphysical sense it refers to the sublimation and purification of consciousness. But the important point to be noted here is that 9 on the Tree of Life also relates to the automatic consciousness, the subconsciousness of modern psychology. This is the habit-mind, and since habits determine fundamental character and temperament, here is a very strong hint that the supreme attainment, or completion of occult training, is the establishment of right habits, the purification of the automatic consciousness, so that he who has completed the Great Work maintains his right relation to the cosmic rhythms automatically , without the necessity for continual conscious effort which"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"95 besets those of us who are not yet perfect adepts. Key 9 of the major trumps will repay study in this connection. Note that the Hermit has himself reached the heights of attainment, but that he is disseminating light to others who struggle upward on the path. 9 in the Qabalah is called the Sphere of the Moon. The Number 10 The number 10 is a sacred number in occultism. Symbolized as shown in the margin. • • • • • • • • • • it was called the Tetraktys, and on this figure Pythagoras is said to have sworn his pupils to secrecy. 10 is a self-reproductive number, because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10, or the theosophic extension of 10, is 55, and the digits of 55 add to 10. In Hebrew Wisdom 10 is called Malkuth ( MLKVT h) the Kingdom. It is also known as the Sphere of the Elements , the Hebrew for this designation meaning literally, “The Breaker of the Foundations,” or that in which the fundamental basis of manifestation is divided into apparent multiplicity, or broken up into parts. The meaning of “kingdom” is, the realm of a king, the sphere of a king’s operations, also the government, laws and administrative activity whereby the authority of a king is made manifest. Thus in the Bible the idea of “Kingdom” is definitely connected with the Ten Commandments which are the summary and basis of the Mosaic Law. The King dom in other words is the manifest law . Thus the theosophic extension of 10 gives the number 55, or the doubling of 5, the number of Law and Justice. 10 is also called the Resplendent Intelligence , but the Hebrew adjective is probably derived from a word meaning number, measure, arrangement, composition. The root-idea is that of Order, and just as 10 is the theosophic extension of 4, so is the idea of arrangement implied by 4 worked out to its completion in the occult meaning of 10. Key 10 in the major trumps represents this conception of a world-order, or cosmic mechanism. In the human organism, 10 corresponds to the field of sensation, to the point of contact between a human being and the world around him. The connection of all this material with divination may not be apparent at the first or even at the tenth reading. But the student who wishes to be a true diviner will do well to develop as much understanding of these ten fundamental numbers as he can. For the final stage of the divinatory operation, in which the basic meanings of one of these numbers is the key to the interpretation of whatever cards appear in the layout, is the one which most often leads to the discovery of the essential significance of the operation."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"96 Oracle of Tarot Final Stage of Divination The operation itself is concluded by counting the cards, and pairing, as in earlier stages of the divination. Because there are 78 cards in the pack, and they are dealt one at a time into ten heaps, the first 8 piles will contain 10 cards each, and the last two will contain only 9 cards. And since the Significator will be one of these, in piles 1 to 8 inclusive there will be a single card left over at the completion of the pairing, while in piles 9 and 10 the pairs will come out even. The single card in the first 8 piles, and the card to the left of the last pair in the 9th and 10th piles will be the one that gives the final indication as to time. The rule for judging this is the same as that given in the preceding lesson. — • — YOU now have the method. All that you need from now on is practice. Above all, be sure to learn thoroughly the fundamental meanings of the cards. When these are committed to memory, you will find that their correlations are much easier to understand. You will find that if you work with one suit at a time in the minor trumps, mentally calling up the image of each card, wherever you happen to be, you can soon perfect your knowledge in odd moments which might otherwise be wasted."}]
