Suppose we want health. We know that subconsciousness canies on all the body-building work. Our concern is not with the processes, but with their outcome. The second point to bear in mind, therefore, is this: tottr .ot rcious work ends when you have formulated a clear, distinct image of the result you desire and have turned over that image to subconsciousness in such a way that it will be acted upon. Take care always to express perfect confidence in the powers of subconsciousness. To be in doubt, to be anxious about results, to indulge in too many repetitions of your suggestions, is to express a pattern ofyour fears instead ofa pattern ofyour expectations. Then subconsciousness immediately goes to work to materialize the fear pattern it has received, for the emotion is as vital as the image. Thus you need to be thoroughly familiar with Lesson 2 before attempting the practice given in this and subsequent lessons. Lesson 2 provides you with knowledge of lacts which will enable you to banish all moods of doubt or arxiety as to the power of subconsciousness; and, in conjunction with what you will learn from this present lesson, that knowledge will help you to approach the work of directing subconscious forces in the spirit of full conflrdence which is indispensable to success. When you know what slbconsciousness can do, you will make your demands on it in complete assurance that they will be carried out to the last detail. Concerning the meaning of suggestion there is much confusion of tongues. Some say that a suggestion is anything which makes an impression on subconsciousness. This is true, but it is also vague because nothing except a suggestion makes any impression on subconsciousness and what we need to know is just what will make the necessary impression. Others limit the term susgestion to commands impressed on the mind during mesmeric, hypnotic, or hypnoidal states. Actually, such states are themselves results of suggestion, and except in the abnormal conditions they present, subconsciousness is distinctly not amenable to direct commands. If we go back to the dietionary, we find all authorities agreed that there must be some degree of subtlety in suggestion. A suggestion is a hint. As we employ it, the term retains this connotation of subtlety. An effective suggestion is indirect. Subconsciousness more readily responds to what is implied than to what is explicitly affirmed, stated, or commanded. It does this because of a characteristic described in the prece{ing lessons. Subconscious reasoning is deductive. It is natural for this part of your mentality to work out hints and carry them to their logical conclusions. To employ your subconscious powers to the best advantage, you must take this characteristic into account. A suggestion is anythingwhich HINTS at the subconscious response desired. You do not have to coerce subconsciousness. You do have to acquire the art of gently intimating what you want done. Hence an old occult text, which teaches applied psycholory"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"SEVENSTEPS: 3 3 under the gUise of alchemy, says the work of controlling our hidden powefs must be done \"suavely, and with great ingenuity.\" you should understand now what is meant by the statement: Subconsciousness is alwalrs amenable to control by suggestion, All the wonderful powers described in Lesson 2 titity for right direction rests on you' Your subconsciousness is always respon\"i,r\" and iiis easy to govern when you *ork with it in the tilrtt *\"y.

Until you keep order as well as you can, all the success suggestions you can possibly find time to repeat will he over-balanced by the subtle hints of failure conveyed by the disorderly condition of your surroundings. These examples are given to make it clear that subconsciousness is not only amenable to suggestions given at certain times, but rather is always amenable and obeys the predominant suggestion. Nothing in true occultism will give you a magic formula to win success if you are disorderly; to be healthy if you neglect the ordinary rules of hygierte; or to be happy if you persist in making negative interpretations of your experience. Subconsciousness is controlled from the level of self-conscious awareness. What we think, say and do throughout the day furnishes the bulk of impressions received by subconsciousness. We have, first, to give some consideration to our bodies. Then we need to devote attention to what we say. After this we shall be ready to watch our thoughts. The work begins with our bodies because all we accomplish must be done through their instrumentality. This is not a course on diet or hygiene and it will not enter into details concerning those matters. Get the facts about what your body needs in the way of food, water, air and light. The facts, not the fantastic theories of faddists and quacks. Then put this knowledge to practical use. By so doing you will give your subconsciousness the strongest possible hint that you want it to build you a healthy body. In subsequent lessons you will find instructions as to the formulation of the right sort of mental patterns, but remember that you can no more build a healthy body without the needed materials than you can build a house merelSz by looking at the architect's plans. When you have learned what you require to build a healthy body and are supplying what it needs, turn your attention to your environment. Begin with your clothes. See to it that they are clean and well cared for. Next turn your attention to your abode and make sure the place where you sleep is spotless and orderly. Make your working quarters as orderly as you can even thoughyou may notbe so free to carry outyour personal ideas. Those details for which you are personally responsible can always be kept in order. Follow these simple, easy rules, and you will give your subconsciousness the most powerful kind of success suggestions. What to do in the way of controlling words and thoughts will be explained in later lessons, and developed more fully in the Tarot courses. Skill in constructive speech and in the formulation of truly creative thoughts comes from definite practices which require somewhat extended description. Begin at once to put the counsel of this lesson into practice. Thus you will take your first steps in using the law this section of the instruction explains."}]
