Yit all that might be written-would be but a p*ii\"f account of what really occurs, and it has been said that in all probability, continuous research for the next h'c .\"r,to\"i., will not sufftce to exhaust the analysis of this one simple action.

The honest answer to this question is, \"We do not know.\" In this ,orr\"r\", *e ai- to iell you what we do know' From reports sent in by p*ottr who have usei mental methods to change their emotional attitudes, thereby Iiimulating the subconscious healing power, *\" Lrro* that organic heart disease, abnormal growths, pll\"r, eczern , asthma, and-other ailments which often baflle ordinary physicians, have been cured. This, however, is not a lesson on mental healing. Subconsciousness can restore your body to heaith and keep it well, but it has other wonderful powers. Experiments have shoinn that it keeps a jerfect record of all our experiences. Whatever affects any of our senses leaves a subconscious impressionSnd when right conditions are provided, any detail of this complete story of our p\"rt m\"y be recalled. Thus the secret of a good memory is not really . -utt\", of reiaining impressions, but of making clear ones, relating them properly log\"ih\"r, and bringing theL tothe surface of consciousness when needed. When one knows this secret of recollection, he has at his disposal the wealth of experience stored in his mind as a result of his acts of conscious attention. Practice, *o\".orr\"\", will enable him to make use of the greater treasure consisting of an immense number of impressions which have been recorded without his conscious knowledge' Furthermore, subconsciousness arranges and works upon this mass of mental records, and seems to have power to think on its own account. This subconscious reasoning, however, has certain limitations. It is restricted to deduction, that is, to drawing conclusions from premises. Apparently the subconscious thought processes tend to elaborate every logical conclusi-on from a given premise- This deductive prqcess. however' lusi Thr, \".\"hy lh.r\" \"i * *u\"y f\"lse doctrines, so many strange superstitions.

The p*hrase was isolated and its decipherment led to the recovery of the whole system of writing.

All these subconscious operations are manifestations of the force described in the preceding lesson. M;;t; pry.t otogy,-i\"f^\"t science though it be, has discovered enough about how our minds behave to show us that ancient occult methods for directing our hidden powers rest on a firm basis of natural law. Any one who can understand the teaching of certain books written ro\"g;!o soon perceives that the art of directing and using this inner force is no new thing. fn \"-u\"[t age ttrere have been some persons who"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 SEVEN STEPS: 2 understood this art, and they have left records of which you will get the essence in this course of instructions. Some of these records have strange forms, but we have keys to their meaning. Thus it is possible to give you a series of clear, specific instructions which will show you just what to do in order tJ make your mind and body effective instruments for realizing your aim in life. This technique will be explained in language you can understand. It constitutes a practical art of life which has been subjected to rigorous tests. Modern science explains some of it, but not all. A child may learn to swim even though he has no scientif-rc knowledge of the laws of physics which enable him to do so. You can learn how to manage your latent powers even though you may not yet be able to understand \"just why\" your practice produces the results it does. Fix your attention on powers you can use immediately in order to realize your chosen objective. K:eow that when you direct subconsciousness you employ forces which can enable you: 1. To keep your body functioning effrciently; 2. To develop your intuitive knowledge of the laws of nature you must employ to achieve your One Aim; 3. To get in touch with the persons and things you need in order to reach your chosen goal. Now do you begin to see that the statement you wrote out when studying Lesson 1 means a great deal more than you may have realized at first? When you say' \"I will apply all my powers,\" you are including these mighty subconscious forces described in this lesson, as well as any other powers of personality of which you may have been awate when you wrote out your statement of purpose. In choosing your specific object, you have already set in motion the mighty agency which has aided thousands of other persons to gtow in wisdom, power, happiness and true spirituality. You can learn more about this Great Magical Agent, as Eliphas Levi called it. You can direct its currents. You can learn to use it for every conceivable good end. It is yours to command, yours to employ for the production of revolutionary changes in your personality and your circumstances. You are now part of an organized movement which ,rtilir.r these potencies of subconsciousness every day, and every hour of the day. Some of the achievements of persons connected with this movement have been simply astounding. Yet they have been accomplished by persons in no essential respect more gifted than you. Devote a full week to the study of this lesson. Continue making your declaration of purpose every morning and every night. As you say the words, remember that they are pturrtit g potent suggestions in your subconsciousness to which it will certainly and fully respond."}]
