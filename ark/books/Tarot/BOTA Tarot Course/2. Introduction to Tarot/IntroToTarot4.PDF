[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT Lesson Four KEY 6. THE LOVERS Nails fasten things together. Swords cut them apairl. Thus there is a contrast between the letter printed on the Lovers and that which is assigned to the Hierophant. The latter is, basically, a symbol of union. The fundarnental idea expressed by Zain l, \"thg sword\", is division. Tlre scene in Key 6, again, is, in several respects, an antithesis to that of Key 5. As in Key 5, there are three principal figures, but the supedor one-the angel-makes a contrast to the Hierophant; and the two below him, by obvious irnplication Adam and Eve in their garden, are nude, whereas the rninisters kneeling before the Hierophant are clad in ceremonial vestments. Fufihermore, the ministers in Key 5 face inward toward the Hierophant, with theil backs tou'ald the observer of the picture, and away from the background, where the sun is at its midmolning position in the East' The principal lesson of this Key is of importance to all who wish to malce best use of their po*.tr. in simple temrs it is this: Superconsciousness (the angel) sheds its influence impartially upon both self-consciousness (the man) and subconsciousness (the woman)' In spite of the ancient philosophical terrninology which makes subconsciousness seem to be what Orientals call the \"infedol\"' nature, while self-consciousness is termed the \"superior\", these two are coequal. That is, they ar-e fundamentally so; but when these two aspects of the personal nature of man come under the \"curse\" mentioned in the allegory of the Fall, the woman then becomes subject to her husband. Her restoration to her rightftil place of equality is one of the great practical works of Ageless Wisdom. Despite the misedes which st. Paul's theological interpretation of the allegory of the Fall has visited on wornankind tluoughout the Westem world, there is a great truth in the allegory itself. Subconsciousness is always amenable to suggestion, and, unless rightly directed by self- consciouspess, falls easily under the sway of the appearances and illusions having their source in physical sensation. us080l"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"lNTRODUCTION TO 7'AROT: 4 These appearances and illusions are pictuled in Key 6 as the se{pent coiled round the tree behind the woman, and the tree has five fiuits, in reference to the life of the physical senses, which seem so attractive to those who yield to its temptations. It is not that the life of sensation is in itself evil, but, from beginning to end, all that rnan knows by sensation consists of pairs of opposites-good and evil, as the Bible allegory puts it. Such larowledge is of no value whatever as a means for wise self-dilection. It has a specious appearance of being useful, but the enor of those who believe they can make out a successful course in life by maldng themselves familiar with all the pairs of opposites is that nobody can possibly acquire this knowledge. As the allegory of the Fall puts it, Adam and Eve were pelfectly happy so long as they were obedient to the Lord. When they listened to the selpent, they found themselves in trouble right away. The \"Lord\" is the personification of superconsciousness, pictuled in Key 6 as the Angel. So long as the personal life is under the direction of that truly superior aspect of Being, all goes well. Just as soon as the connection with superconsciousness is broken by mistaken endeavors to plan one's life in accordance with the repofts of physical sensation, all goes wrong. Remembel, the \"Lord\" is not an outside ruler who imposes his will on human beings. There is no such ruler. For though the true Self is, in one sense, superiol to any human beirtg, and has an existence which extends far beyond the lirnits of any human personality, that same Self is the innermost reality at the core of every single human life. By depending on that, and on that only, for guidance and sustenance, one's life is regulated and aruanged from a level superior to the best results of self-conscious reasoning, and superior to the best which subconsciousness can imagine. I(ey 6, then, pictures the situation which is the logical consequence of the steps pictured by the Keys preceding it. When the Magician is consciously related to what is above him, every pattern he makes (symbolized by the arangement of his implements on the table before him) is a good one. From this it follows that the lecord on the scroll of the High Priestess is clear and definite; and then the mental imagery produced by subconsciousness is the good wheat in the Empress'galden. Under such conditions, the Ernperor is no petty tyrant, but is really so completely identihed with the One Self that every conscious state of him who maintains this relationship with the superconscious Self is so imbued witli the influence fi'om above that, to all intents and purposes, what theology calls \"God\" acts directly thlough that personality. Thus it is that the Emperor, though he is just the Magician in another guise, is also one with the Fool, and is therefore pictured with a single eye and a white beard, in subtle reference to occult repre- sentations of the Ancient of Days. His clear vision is supplernented, and its true significance is made manifest, by the Voice of the Hielophant. Thus it follows tl'rat the huppy state of balanced and halmonious lelationship pictured by the Lovers is brought about. us0801"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO T'AROT The two human figures in Key 6 are nude, not only because the symbolism is derived fi'om the allegory of Adarn and Eve, but also because they conceal nothing frorn each other. Just as a man ald woman who love have no shame, and no secrets from one anothet, so the two aspects of human personal consciouslless, when they stand in comect relation to superconsciousness, have none-of the concealments whicli are too often chalacteristic of the relation between these same two aspects of personality in the greater numbel of men and women. I1a later l(ey we shall see a picture of the destruction of false knowledge. One of its striking featules is a catastropire affecting two people, both fully clothed. The average pelson is in disguise. His wolds and face say one thing. His inner thoughts qay something very different' He is always \"putting on an act\" but he hirnself is the most deluded victim of his pretenses. This sort of play-acting is precisely what is meant by the word \"hypocrisy\", and the woes Jesus pronoulced on hypocrites must not be misunderstood as being punishments inflicted on thern by Jesus, or anyone else. The miseries which they suffel ale logical consequences of conflicis in their own minds. Being full of guile, they cannot be members of the spiritual Israel. Guile is evidence of the person's own self-deception. Since the literal meaning of ..Israel\" is \"He shall rule as God\", only one in whose life everything is under the divine guidance pictured by the Angel in Key 6 can be fi'ee from guile' Cerlailly no human being may hope to play God successfully, though many attempt this irnpossibility. yet l're who delibelately sunenders his personal life to supercorlscious direction becornes a1immediate agent of the only God there is. hr this connection it may be noted that the name of the disciple who was called \"an Israelite indeed\", because of his freedom frorn guile, is givel in the Gospel as Natiranael, which, in Hebrew, lneans \"gift of God\"' in pictur.e language, then, Key 6 gives to your subconsciousness a definite suggestion which has tremendous and far-reaching consequences' It says: .,The two aspects of human personality ale diffelent, but equal. One is not 'better' than the other. Each has its own special powers and its own special field of operation. It is not the office ofself-consciousness totyrannize over subconsciousness like an old-fashioned husband. Nor is it the part of subconsciousness, as some silly pseudo-psychologists suppose, to take charge. ..These two lxust have no concealments. They must leave one another free to cany out their own parlicular-types of activity. Self-consciousness observes the objective world and gathers accurate data. Subconsciousness acts as the connecting link between self-cotlsciousness and superconsciousness. ..It is through subconsciousness that our contact with the Voice of the Flierophant is established. It is thr.ough subconscious charurels that we arrive at understanding of significance. It is alsolhrough subconsciousness that new ideas and new mental imagery come into manifestation'\" us080 I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT More rnight be said along the same lines, but we bring this irilroduction to Key 6 to a close with a practical suggestion. After looking at this Key, and absorbing as much of its meaning as you can with the aid of what has been said in this lesson, use your ingenuity to frame a special message to your own personal subconsciousness. Let the words be your very own, but let the central idea be this: \"From now ot1, subconsciousness, you are no longer amenable to suggestions fi'amed by me at the level of my personal self-consciousness, unless those suggestions are confinned by superconsciousness. You ale fi'ee from the errors of the misinterpretations I have made in the past.\" The effect of this delibelate, reasoned surrender of all personal domination over your sgbconsciousness is by no fireans the same as tulning over your personal life to the vagaries of subconsciousness. The results may not be apparent immediately, yet, in the long run, you will find that all conflicts between your subconsciousness and your self-consciottsness are cleared up. You will find youlself experiencing, day after day, the wonderful and beneficent results of superconscious guidance. This does not mean you will never make mistakes. Your self-conscious mind has limits. It is fallible. That you may gain skill in using it, you are left free to malce errors of various kinds. Guidance will not turn you into a puppet. What is avoided by this suggestion and its consequences is the echoing, or reverbcratiou, of such mistakes tbuough your subsequent history. When the subconscious mind knows that it is not to accept as premises for elaboration any opinions or commands of self-consciousness turless it has also received confinnation for tliern from superconsciousness, the consequences of our superficial errors are easy to overcome, and easy to correct. USOBOI"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT, KEY 7. THE CHARIOT A sword is prirnaliiy a weapon of offence. Again, as a cutting instrument, it is related to such ideas as division, separation, partition, and the like. In contrast to these ideas connected with the lettel Zain arc those related to the letter Cheth ll, the name of which is the Hebrew noun for \"an enclosute, a fence\". These include such contrasts to offence and separation as defense, protection, inclusion, and the like. The primitive character for this letter, surviving in the English alphabet almost without change as tire capital letter \"H\", was a crude picture of a fence or palisade. Again,to Zain and the Lovers the sign Gemini is attributed, and the astrological syrnbol II suggests separatiotl; but to Cheth the sign Cancer, the Crab, is attributed. All the astrological meanings of Gemini lelate to ideas of separation, distinction, discrirnination and classification, and in the human body this sign is said to govern the hands, arms, shoulders and lungs-all in pairs. In contrast, astrological interpretations of Cancer stress its plotective, sheltering and shielding char.acteristics, and in the human organism, the mammary glands which nourish babies, and the bony wall of the chest, which protects stomach, lungs and heaft, are said to be governed by Cancer. From most ancient tirnes, the number 7 has been ireld in special veneration. It has certain peculiar mathematical properlies which wele noted by Pythagoras and other Greek philosopheLs, who named 7 Phylactics, in reference to its supposed protective powers. The scene in Key 7 presents many contrasts to the Lovers. Key 6 shows everything in a state of nature. The human figures are nude. They stand in open countty, and their surroundings slrow no trace of human invention or human handicraft. Iky 7 multiplies the \"fence\" idea in various ways. In the background is a city, surrounded by a stone wall. At the foot of the wall is a riveL, which is another defense to protect the inliabitants of tire town. In the foreground, the chariot is a poftable fence, and the lider wears armor which protects his body-especially his chest-against injury. Fufthermore, to confirrn the attribution of this Key to the sign Cancer, each shoulder of the rider bears a lunal crescent, and the Moon is the ruler of Cancer. Close examination will show that the face in the crescent at the left of the picture is forbidding and seveLe, while that on the other: side wears a smiling, benign explession. A sirnilar contrast is shown in the faces of the two sphinxes crouching before the car. us0801"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 4 In Key 6, the two human figures stand apart, though they do receive equal influences from the angel overhead. In Key 7, the two lunar masks are joined by the lider's body, and the two sphinxes are ateamunited in drawing the car. What is here intended is emphasis on the idea that Key 7 represents the unification and reconciliation of opposites. In Key 6, the stress is on the antithesis presented by the two figures, male and female. In Key 7 , the idea of synthesis is prominent in every part of the design. Furthermore, this synthesis is one which is achieved by human agency. psychologically, one of the meanings of Key 6 is discrimination; but all the meanings of Key 7 haveto do with the synthesis of the various plinciples we have been consideling up to this point. That synthesis is Will. Ageless Wisdom declares unequivocally that an absolutely fi'ee will is part of the make-up of every human being. Yet it is equally emphatic in its denial that there is any such thing as a separate power of volition peculiar to each human being. Accordilg to this doctrine, the only Will there is in the universe is what exoteric theology calls \"the will of God\". Yet the esoteric doctrine is a sharp variance fiom the exoteric fancy that any man has a will of his own which he can oppose to the will of God. When any man supposes hirnself to be possessed of such personal free will, he is suffering from a fuirdamental delusion. I' Key 7, one symbol of the esoteric doctrine of will is the liver. It flows into the picture from outside, and flows out again. In like maffier, the power we feel inside outselves as that which we exercise in acts of volition, is not something having its source iu our personality, but sornething which flows through the field of personal existence. The word \"vehicls\", a synonym for \"chariot\", is, in fact, the clue to the whole esotetic conception of the function of human personality and to the esoteric doctrine of will. Persons are instrumelts and agencies of the One Life. Persons originate neither themselves nor their actions. That they do not originate themselves is a matter of daily obseruation, yet many do not see how contradictory it is to suppose that a personality, which is obviously the end product of a series of antecedent causes reaching far back into the past, should, in some strange fashion, have absolute free will of its own. Do not mistake our meaning. We repeat that Ageless Wisdom insists on the reality of fiee will as a true component in the make-up of every human being. None of the modern doctrines of determinism, which make man a mere reaction mechanism responding automatically to var.ious extemal stimuli, receive any confirmation from the true esoteric doctrine. Our denial of the personal element in free will is no denial of rnan's essentially free power of volition' What we are sayilg really is that the person is not the man-that the person is, as the very word person ildicates, only a mask, or agency, or vehicle, through whicir the spiritual Man finds expression. us080 l"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTlON TO TAROT: In Tarot, thus fal, the Man has been symbolized by the dominant figure in each Key' The Man is the Fool, the Magician, the High Priestess, the Empress, the Emperor, the Hielophant, the Algel over the Loveis, and the Rider in the chariot. The person is replesented by the Magician's implements, his lobes, and the flowels in his garden. So it is thloughout the series. Those elements in any Tarot picture which relate to personality are always subordinate-as the scroil of the High Priestess, the roses, wheat ant shield of the ErnpLess, the domain of the Emperor, the ministers kneeling before the Hielophant, and the two Lovers' If this be kept in mind, the imrel meaning of Tarot will be more and more clearly revealed to you as you continue using it. For the whole purpose of these Keys rnay be summed up as Self-revelation' as a psychological training which will enable you to live in intimate contact with the Self, and to experience the beneficent consequences ofthis union' Thus receptivity is the personal attitude indicated by tliis Key 7. The main purpose of a chariot is to contain its ricler und thut of a fence is to contain the field it surrounds. The field is not physically sepalate fi'om the land outside. The wall is only a superficial and artificial means for.setting apart a portion of the whole surface of the land for certain specific uses. Similarly, human persolls are like fenced fields.

They who become highly proficient in occult training have to bleak down many of these \"fences\"' When they succeed in doing this, they regail the use of powers which ale man's lightful heritage.
