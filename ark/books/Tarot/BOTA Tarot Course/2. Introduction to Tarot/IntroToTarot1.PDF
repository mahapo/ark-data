Even as we rnight introduce you to a wise and helpful counselor', so these Tarot lessons will give you the same uplifting benefits which we, and countless othels through the ages, have derived fiom this source of wisdom an'd inspiration' It is not our purpose to give you a mass of more or less occult knowledge about Tarot' Mere u'assimilated knowledge not put to practical use is no better than undigested food which, no matter how it rnay please the palate, passes through the system without nourishing. So in this coul.se you will be given instruction in the practical and daily use of Tarot, for only through such usage and appiication can its marvelous and truly magical benefits be obtained. you may have a long history of academic education, or you may not have finished high school. You may have a r\"ui irrt\"r\"rt in symbols, 01'you may think symbols are of no col1cern to you a1d your affairs. You may have a good lnemory, or a bad o1e' (If it is a bad one' it will soon improve, plovided you use Tarot as we shall explain it') You may be a marvel at concentration, or ,.rppor! yourself to be the world's undefeated mind-wandering champion' Begi' to use Tarot just where you are and you will effect decided, even staftling, changes for the bettet'.

Therefore having coloring instructions condensed into one area is an added convenience for such purposes' If anything you r.ead in HiGHLIGHTS gives you the notior-r that Tarot is so abstruse and occult that it is way over your head, dismiss that notion.

It is not at all necessary to learn how Tarot is put together'. Some people, of course, wish to know as much about Tarot as possible, ie., its history and technical construction. Indeed this is necessary for gaining certain kinds of more advanced esoteric knowledge.Later this will be made available for those who qualiff. Now, however, we shall not burden your rnemory with a single fact wliich you cannot put to irnrnediate and practical use. You have hopes and fears, longings and frustrations. You have problems you'd like to solve. You may be seeking a better job. Ol it may be that your physicai organism seems to be in need of some adjustment. Whatever may be the parlicular situation in which you find yourself, whether it be good or bad, you wouldn't be human if you hadn't, down in your heafi of hearts, a desire for a greater lneasure of fieedorn than you now enjoy. Plecisely that greater freedom is what you will experience if you gain skill in using Tarot. To do so it is necessary to practice, and the eariy stages will require some effort and a great deal of persistence. All, excepting those pathologically subnormal, can leam to use Tarot, for it is based on a principle of mental activity colrrnon to all. It is a principle we have all been using since early childhood. Thele is nothing new about it and nothing unfamiliar. The only novelty is in the application. The principle is this: all oul basic thinking is done in pictures. We see befole we say. Pictules form in oul minds before we label thern with wolds. Sometimes our pictures are not as clear as they might be. Usually this is because most of our schooling puts too much faith in the sr-rpposed virtue of mere words. We spend so much time reading and talking, and so much of our education is no more than learning words and fonlulas by rote, that we have let our power of vision fall mole or less into disuse-to our great disadvantage. Whatever initial difficulty you may have in learning to use Tarot rnay be traced to the bad habit of thinking in words without being sure these mental labels are attached to any real pictures. At this point, we say nothing of the disastels which result fi'om getting wholly mistaken labels on our mental pictures. Nor shall we discuss as yet the dangers we invite when we content ourselves with hasty mental snapshots often taken with our mental cameras out of foctts. Our first steps will be very simple. Begin by using the actual Tarot pictures. Sit in a comfortable chair and give five minutes every day to looking attentively at one of the twenty- two Tarot Keys. Do this preferably in the morning as soon as you have finished dressing, and before eating breakfast. If this is impracticable, any other tirne of day may be selected, so long as it is approximately the satne hour every day. us080 l"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: Spend just three days on each of the Tarot Keys. Thus the total time givetl to Tarot practice dur.ing this entire course will be just fifteen minutes per Key, a total of five houls and thirty minutes over a period of eleven weeks. Hence nobody can offer the excuse that he hasn't time for this study. Nobody who reads this lesson can say he hasn't five minutes a day to use as he likes. And precisely that, and no lnore, is all the tirne you have to set aside for the actual practice of looking at the Keys. It is important, in fact, not to spend more than five minutes at this. That anytliing so apparently easy should ploduce remarkable lesults may seem hatd to believe. But the wise men who invented Tarot hit upon a simple way to overcome a difhculty which besets evely person who tries to control his mind. For thousands of years it has been known that extraordinary powers are latent in every human being and that these powers may be directed by anybody who can keep his mind frorn wandering. Thus we have whole libraries of books about concentration, and the more we read the more does it seem that concentration must be a very difficult matter. An old Oliental writer says we are close to adeptship when we can keep a single image before the mind's eye for just a few minutes. To accomplish this without extemal aids is very difficult. Thus Tibetans and Hindus have picfures called mandalas which are used as aids to concentration. Images of the gods serve a similar puipose. Tarot is a device which consists of pictures designed in a.ccordance with the actual opelation of rnan's rnental activities. Look at a Talot Key attentively for five minutes. During this time yow state of consciousness will be similal in fonn and content to that of a gleat Adept as he contemplates some aspect of his own mental activity. Furthermore, through the agency of this I(ey and irnage and your contemplation of it, youl consciousness will automatically begin to tune in to the consciousness of those of high spilitual estate . . . evetl to the Adepts of the Inner School. You may not become aware of this immediately, though some do. However, patience and perseverance will inevitably bring theil reward and probably sooner than you expect. We caution you not to devote more than five minutes at a time to the practice of looking at any one Tarot Key. You are not yet an adept. Thus your brain is not at present adjusted to canying the full load of an adept's consciousness about anything whatever. Holding one of these Talot Keys in youl mental field for five minutes has a definite and beneficent physical lesult. Do not try to increase the benefit by longer sessions with the Key. We have given a reason in the preceding paragraph, and this is only one of several. Among others is what science calls tlie law of diminished returns. Some coal will feed a srnall fire. More will increase the heat. Too much will smother it. USOSAI"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I N7'RO DUCTI ON TO TA ROT' Read this week's lesson at least twice duling the coming week, and as often as you Inay find it necessaly to make sure that you undelstand it thoroughly. Read it whenever you find a good opportulity. Don't make harcl work of it, or of any'thing else counected with your Talot study' Above all don't tty to cotumit anything to memory. When you receive this lesson, look at Key 0 duling the five minutes so as to get a genelal impr.ession of the design. Next day give a little more attention to the details. The third day see if you can find anything not mentioned in the blief paragraphs of description in HIGHLIGHTS and in this lesson. If you do see anything that seems to be important, or that rouses yout' cur.iosity, make a note of it and ask yourself, \"What does this mean?\" Sooner or later you will get the right answer and it will cotne from within- Dur-i1g the first weeks the results may not be particularly impressive. Sometimes it occurs that rernari<able reactions are experienced from the very begiruring. As a fule, the effect of Tarot practice is cumulative rather than immediate. Suppose you have gone tluough life feeling unloved or unlovable. This becomes a deep-seated s.rb\"onscious pattern which manifests in your environment. It expresses itself in yout' relationships with family, friends or business associates. We are in continuous contact with each other on subconscious levels. If we feel unlovable, we call forlh fiotn ourselves nd others the type of conduct which brings rejection. Change the inner pattern and you change your relationships from unhappy to happy ones. Tarot will help you to do this. Its plactice gladually helps you to know who ancl what you are and the results become manifest in your everyday life. As we learn to feel and live the positive states of mind, we transform our personalities. This gives us greater ability to change our environment. Affinnations are helpful, but they do not !o far enough. Tarot practice is designed to bring about the transmutations which are requiled Ior nental and spiritual growth. It will work, if you work it. Often no striking reaction is noticed ultil ole coffres to a Key which has relatiott to some sensitive point in one's own me'tal make-up. This rnay be a strong point ol a weak one; but one feels definitely that he has a special affinity for one or more of tlie Tarot Keys. There is a profound occult reason for this. Yet you should be on your guard against paying more attention to one Key than to anotlrer, especially during this introductory course. Every one of the I{eys is a picture, rem.effrber, of some aspect of yourself. The subject matter of the Tarot series, from beginning to encl, is always yourself. No matter what a picture may look like, it is invariably a picture of you. Thus Tarot has to do with the one thing which really interests you more than anything else in the world. If yol suffer fi'om mock rnodesty, or some other complex such as psychologist mention, you may not be willing to admit that nothing interests you so much as yourself. If you are a healthy-minded, normal person, you know this is true, and will adrnit it readily. If us080l"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODTJCTION TO TAROT you are really what is called an \"advanced soul\", there is nothing else that interests you. All wisdorn is the matured experience of those who obey the injunction, \"Know Thyself.\" All ethics rests on the same foundation, fol uobody who is wanting in self*nowledge can practice the Golden Rule. All science, no matter in what field, has the same basis and the iame objectives. Fol whatevel science the human race possesses is th.e collective result of the research and invention of human selves, and every force lffiown to physicists and chemists is a folce at work inside man as well as outside hirr. The Wheel of Tarot is really the wheel of irumal nature. By keeping this always in mind you will avoid making Tarot a mere set of pictorial syrnbols. KEY O. THE FOOL In your HIGHLIGHTS OF TAROT you have read a brief explalation of this Key, and in the Table of Attribltions of the sarne boolclet you u,ill find that the Fool is the Tarot picture of superconsciousness and of cultuml power' If any of the other details mentioned in the booldet happen to stick in your memoty, well and good; but make no endeavor to cornmit to rnemory any of the matelial in HIGHLIGFITS. You may see the reason for some of the attributions. Others may seem fal-fetched. You will, howeveL, find in the foilowing paragraphs all you need to lanow in order to lay a foundation for thorough understanding of KeY 0' All the Tarot I(eys irave two distinct levels of interpretation. There is the outer-, superficial significance which may be seen at a glance. Then there is the deepet, innet meaning which may be brouglrt to the surface of consciousness without efforl or stlain by the simple act of loolcing attentively at the Key' Super-ficially, the Fool is a picture of a heedless, sky-gazing man, just about to fall from a gr.eat height into a deep abyss. It corlesponds exactly to all proverbial wisdom conceming the folly of having one's head in the clouds. Even if yog get no furlhel than tiris with Key 0, it has a valuable lesson. One does run the risk of grave dangers when he is so engrossed with actual or rnetaphorical sky-gazing that he pays no attention to his present situation. Tirus the first lesson of Tarot is this: us080 I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 1 Don't project yourself so far into the future that you lose sight of where you are' Dreams and visions and icleals have their.proper place; but he who loses hirnself in the contemplation of airy nothings unfits himself for dealing with the plactical affairs of life. At the deepel level of interpretation, the Fool is a picture of what we must use in all our endeavors to attain a gleater measure of fieedom. Valious names have been given to this power. You may call it any of those listed in HIGHLIGHTS. You may term it God. You may call it yonr real Self. Names are only labels, sonte better, some worse, than others. Keep on gsing the one you are accustomed to unless some of those given in our booklet seem to come nearer to beir-rg adequate. The more impoftant thing to have in mind as you look at Key 0 is that it is leally the most perfect and most complete aspect of yourself. It is the part of you which is above and beyond your external personality. Above and beyond your thinking, conscious mind. Part of your vely Self, rernelrber-or even more truly, the Whole of you, of which mind, body, and all else entering into your seemingly separate pelsonality are but parts. This is a picture of the absolutely fiee and petfect Being which is the anirnating principle and core of your outel personality. It bears the number Zercbecause 0 is by no ilIeans a symbol of mere nothingness. In occult adthmetic, 0 stands fol absolute Unity, for that One Reality which is before all beginnings. This is nothing we know directly. We cannot sense it, We caruiot define it. We ca1lot prove that it really exists because it is beyond all our logic and our reasoning just as it is beyond every other conceivable iimitation. Yet the unauimous repolt of the wise is tliat this One Life-power is a real presence which pervades the universe, and Those Who Know bear witness that, beyond knowledge of the ordinary sort, and beyond the limits and definitions of logic, there is possible an experience of this Eternal Youth whose life runs through creation and is the fount of vitaiity for all lesser lives. Closer examination of the pictue will show you that though ihe Fool stands close to the edge of a pr.ecipice, there is room for him to talce another step fotward. The esotelic tradition lvhich has come down to us frorn the original inventors of Tarot says this detail of the symbolisrn signifies an eternal truth. No matter how far the Life-power may advance, it can always take another step. On the personal level of interpretation, as it applies to you, this means that you never come to the very limit of your possibilities. Sometimes you may wander into a blind alley, but even then you can always retrace youl steps a little and come to a place whele further progress is possible. The1e are profound metaphysical and philosophical reasons for the seiection of the title of Key 0. We need not entel into them here. Yet one reason is obvious.

Here it rnight be well to add that it does not follow that every tomfool is really a rnan superior to his fellows. We must not fall into the en'or of tl,ose plirnitive tribes who regard madmen as being divinely inspired. A good tnany supposedly civilized persons seem to embrace this error, even today. Consider the hypnotic effect of a Hitler or a Mussolini upon their deluded followers. Glance at the advefiisements on the religious page of any metropolitan newspaper and you can see fol yourself that psychosis is often rnistaken for prophecy. During the three days you look at the picture of the Fool, make no conscious effort to interplet the symbols. If an idea comes to you, make a note of it. Provide yourself with a loose-leaf notebook. Don't make any special endeavor to fill it. An idea rnay come to you any time and you can jot it down on a piece of paper or the back of an envelope. As you plogress with this wolk you'll find youlself taking a little tirne, one or two evenings a week, to look over your notes and add to them. Interest grows with attention and the longer you work with the Tarot Keys the rnole will they intrigue you. The rnain practical use of I(ey 0 is to put you in touch with your irurer sources of power. After you have looked at the actual picture fol tluee consecutive days, you will find that you can slrmrloll it before youl mind's eye easily. Just think about it and you will see it. Thr-rs you can hoid youl mind to this parlicular folm whenever you desire. And you will find tirat even a momentary glimpse of this gay traveler through the higher spaces will give you a 1ift. Try it whenevel you are beset by a mood of depression. Don't try to suppress the mood. Just look at the Fool. Look at the actual picture and keep it handy. Glance at it mentally if you are away fiom home. Soon actual experience will convince you that somehow there is always a positive reaction. We might take pages to explain the psychological reasons for this, and if you are one of those who want to know why Tarot works its wonders, you will have plenty of opporlunity to learn as you progress in the B.O.T.A. curriculum. Just now, it is more important to icnow that it does work and this sirnple and easy practice wiil soon convince you that thele is an almost magical potency in this picture. It is a sure antidote for depression."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: l KEY 1. THE MAGICIAN With tliis Key, the principle of contrast which runs tlx'oughout the Tarot series conles into operation. Every Key is in some sense the opposite and complement of the one which precedes it. Also, the twenty-two Keys fall into eleven contrasting pairs: 0 and 1,2 and3,4 and 5, and so on. The contlasts aLe, as a rule, quite obvious. Thus a magician, or wise man, is clearly in contrast to a fool. The Flebrew letter !, Beth, printed on Key 1, suggests the sphere of human life, and the family affails which go on indools, because it means \"house\". But the letter N, Aleph, on Key 0 means \"Bull\" or \"Ox\", and has to do with what goes on in a field outside the s1:ecial limitations of human environment. Again, the number 1 is the numbel of Beginling, but 0 is the sign of the absolute Unity which is befole all beginnings. In the Bible, the very first letter of Genesis is 5, and in the Zohar, one of the principal collections of profound Qabalistic inteqpretations of tl're Scriptures, much is made of the distinction betweeir Aleph as the lilst letter of the alphabet, and Bcth, with whicir, says the Zohar, creation began. Comparison of the two pictures sirows many other contlasts. The Fool stands on a barren height; the Magician in a garden. The Fool is evidently preoccupieci with his vision of a distant height, far beyond him, acloss the abyss. The Magician is concerned with what goes on in his immediate vicinity and he looks down towald what is below him. The Fool's possessions are not in use and he canies thern in a wallet slung over his shoulder. Tire four implernents of the Magician are spread before him on his table and thus they are ready at hand to use as occasion arises. Perhaps the most important detail of Key 1 is the position of the Magician's hands, With his right hand he lifts a wand upward towald the sky. FIis left hand makes the universal gesture of attention, pointing lvith extended forefinger toward the fertile eafih at his feet. The Magician, therefoLe, is a syrnbol of what psychology calls self-conscious awareness, ol' objective mind. This is the ordinary waking consciousness of human beings. It is the plamring mind, the mind which comes to grips with our daily ploblents, and its basic function is attention."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCT]ON TO T/ROT: Alert watchfulness is the key idea of this picture. Hele is a replesentation of what wise men see with their rnind's eye when they consider the nrental ftinction of concentratiou. To your inner consciousness this Key says: \"Be aler1. Remember that all the power you can direct cotnes from a higher level. Malce it your first concern to relate yourself to that Source of power'. Your place in the scheme of things is to act as a transformer of energy. Force flows through you to whatever you give yout' full measule of attention, Nothing can withstand the mental force of one who has mastered the aft of concentration. Yet concentration is as easy as pointing your finger. It is only fools and charlatans who are responsible for the effoneous notion that thele is anything particularly difficr\"ilt about concentration. Just watch, and keep at it. Then you will be able to see thu'ough and into the things which constitute youl envirorunent, instead of merely looking at them'\" As HIGHLIGHTS says, the garden represents the subconscious field whence colne the hidden power.s man may direct in his quest fol increased fi'eedorn. These powers are symbolizedby the lilies and roses. The lilies stand for valious aspects of truth and to this their white color also refers. The roses are symbols of human desires. There are foul lilies because all possible hurnan knowledge falls into four main categories. To explain this here would be to go beyond the range of this introductory course, but we mention it to show that every detail of Tarot symbolism has a definite meaning. There are five roses because every object of human desile has reiation to one or more of the five major senses. Modern psychology adds other senses to the fivefold classification which was current when Tarot was invented; but for all practical purposes it is accurate to say that the fulfillment of any hunr.a:r desire includes the bringing about of conditions which may be experienced by our senses. The Magician cultivates these flowers. He imploves them, and by force of his control of their' developmelt takes thern far beyond the conditions spontaneously provided by natule- He is a tlansformer and trapsmuter of expelience. Taking things as he finds them, he watches until he perceives the under.lying principle at work in what he observes. Then he applies that principle in novel ways so as to ploduce a different situation. This is the whole method of science, and the four irnplements on tlie Magician's table refel to the means employed in meeting and dealing with the actual conditions of human environment. The first mealls is symbolized by the wand. Tiris is simply a pointer and is really an extension of the pointing forefinger. Tlie first lequisite for the solution of any problem is to give it one's full attentiol. Every probiern contains its own solution and that solution is perceived by attentive observation. Such is the beginning of all science. Simple watching. USOBO I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO 7'AROT: 1 The cup stands for the second mental tool. This is imagination. Observation collects experience. hnagination shapes it as a cup shapes what is poured into it. Mrat we call \"laws of nature\" are simply man's collected experiences made into a pattern by acts of imagination. The third means is action, typified by the sword. We may know a gleat deal irnd we may have fine perceptions of relationships, but until we do something, nothing is changed. Our action invariably tears down something in order to replace it with something else. No matter how constructive we may be, this is tt-ue of all effective action' Persons who talk about having nothing but constructive thoughts are making meaningless noises. You can't build a house unless you cut down trees, or quarry stones, or take clay and mould it into bricks. You can't paint a picture unless you take the color out cf the tubes. The statne never appears until the sculptor cuts away the stone which hides the figure he has imagined. Controlled and wisely dilected destruction is the principal tool of civilization. Finally, there is the finished product, and this is represented by a coin because everything made by man's ingenuity has value. Nor should we petmit oulselves to indulge in the silly scom for money which finds spurious support in a bad translation of a passage in the Neu' Testament. Poverly is no mark of spirituality. Moley is a wonderful invention, and when rightly used, a blessing. In spite of what the King James Version says, nowhere does the Bible condemn money. What it does condemn is lust for money. Lust and love are poles aparl. To love anything or anyotle is to have respect for that thing or person, and iove insures proper legard for right use. He who lusts for things or persons is a stranger to love, seeking only selfish personal gratification and having no proper understanding of the object of his base desire. Thgs the coin is one of the most irnporlant symbols in this picture. For no small parl of the sorrows of our day may be traced to two great errors, lust for money and contempt for it. Those who have a proper lespect for this device whereby all values rnay be measured, as all values in science are measured by means of rnathematics, understand that money is one of the greatest human devices for the plomotion of the genelal welfare. The time will come when this measure of value will be used aright, because those who love justice and rnanl<ind will revive the ancient science of money. Key 1, then, is the picture you use to develop your power of concentration, to make you more alert, and to evoke from your inner consciousness powers which wiil enable you to deal mole satisfactorily witli plactical problerns. Key 0 puts you in touch mentally with the limitless Source of all power. Key I calls into action the mental activities wheleby you may apply this power to the end of changing the conditions of your life for the better. us080l 10"}]
