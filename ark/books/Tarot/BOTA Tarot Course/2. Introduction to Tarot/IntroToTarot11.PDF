[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"II{TRODUCTION TO TAROT underlying correspondence Lesson Eleven KEY 20. JUDGEMENT Shin (llJ, pronounced sheen) is the third of the three ,.Mother,, letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The first Mother is Aleph coresponding to the Fool. The second is Mem, the letter of Key 12, the I{anged Man. Aleph and the Fool are related to the element of air. Mem and the Hanged Man are connected with the element of water. Shin and Judgement correspond to the element of fire. This is the fire of Spirit. Knowing this, Hebrew wise men called Shin the Holy Letter. For the numeral value of Shin is 300, and 300 is the total of the values of the letters in Ruach Elohim. \"the Life-Breath of the Gods\". Fire and Spirit are also associated in the occult meanings of the letter Aleph. For Aleph is a symbol for Ruach, the Life-Breath, and to it, as the table in HIGHLIGHTS says, the Fiery Intelligence is attributed. Thus there is to be expected an between Key 0 and Key 20. This is shown in many ways, among them being the fact that the number 20 represents the operation of the power of 0 through the agency of 2. Only one other Tarot Key shows 0 as the immediate cause of what is pictured by the Key. This is, of course, Key 10, where the working of 0 through 1 is indicated. In Key 10, self-consciousness grasps the import of the basic wheel-pattern of cosmic manifestation. In Key 20, what is diagrammed as a wheel in Key 10 becomes part of hgman experience. The active power at work is the fire of Spirit. The agency is subconsciousness which takes the idea represented by Key l0 and works out transformations of personalitv resulting in the realization syrnbolized by Key 20. The table in HIGHLIGHTS gives Perpetual Intelligence as the designation for this type of realization. It is conscious awareness that human life is not temporal, but eternal. Participation in this consciousness was the object of the ancient Mysteries. The founders of those Mysteries understood that this type of knowing is the result of specific training whereby the natural man is transformed into a higher species of being. us}80 l"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTI?ODUCTION TO TA IIOT,. I ] In all accounts of the Mysteries there is always leference to fire in connection with the experience of the Eternal Consciousness. Nor is this merely symbolical. An imperfect experience of this kind led Dr. Bucke to write his book, COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS. Describing his owr brief glimpse of this higher knowing, he speaks of a rosy light so definitely perceived that he thought there must be a fire in the vicinity. The visions of Ezekiel and of St. John identifu the Divine Presence with fire. The Chaldean Oracles describe various stages of the Great Work completed by a vision of a cloud of fire, whirling, and folding itself upon itself. When tliis is perceived, say the Oracles, \"I{ear thou the Voice of the fire.\" Shin means'otooth\" or \"fang\". The immediate suggestion of the noun \"fang\" is that it is the tooth of a setpent whereby deadly poison is injected into the veins of the snake's victim. Again and again in occultism, the power by means of which liberation is attained, and the supernal consciousness realized, is compared to a venolnous serpent. Why is this? Simply because the old man must ('die\" before the new man may be \"born',. Nobody can exercise the higher occult powers and lemain an ordinary human being. The First Matter on which we perform the alchemical operation of sublimation is our own consciousness. We mnst iose oul lives in orcier to find them. The other, more general meaning of Shin refers to the tooth of any animal. Thus it is a sign of that which breaks down forms and begins the process of assimilation. Here, too, is a hint of sometliing deeper. He who enters into the Perpetual Intelligence, Eternal Consciousness, or Conscious Imrnortality, finds that he has not so much atfained that consciousness as that his lesser consciousness has been assimilated by the hieher order of knowing. The real Actor in this divine event is not the man. It is the One Spirit which is like a devouring fire consuming the sense of separate identity, and releasing us from the bonds of time and space. The title, Judgement, implies completion, decision, termination. In none of the older Tarot Keys is this symbol named \"The Last Jr-rdgement\". 'We have here no narrow reference to exoteric Christian doctrines. The inventors of Tarot understood what is veiled by these doctrines. They knew that this picture, like that of the Hierophant (called the Pope in older Tarot designs), would divert the attention of ecclesiastical orlhodoxy from the true purport of the Keys. The title of Key 20 really refers to the completion of the Great Work. USOBO ]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT',, 1] This is the final state of personal consciousness. What is represented by the last Key of Tarot, the World, is beyond any personal condition; but in the sitmtion pictured by Key 20, there is still to be seen the consciousness of \"I and others\", which disappears in the perfect unity symbolized by Key 21. In the composition of the figure of the angel is concealed a geometrical statement of the Fourth Dimension' The whole figure is so drawn that the surrounding cloud defines a circle, containing two smaller circles, one over the other, to make a figure 8. Hence this geometrical basis of the design represents Eternity (the circle) and dominion lttre figure g). In -ruspensky,s TERTIUM ORGANUM, this same geometrical design is employed to r-epresent the Fourlh Dimension. Obviously, the angel is Gabriel. He is the angel of the element of water. The angel is the presiding genius of that meta-physical substance which, throughout Tarot, is symbolized by water, and he is also the active principle behind the apparentlypassive figure of the High Priestess. His trumpet represents the specializationof the Life-Breath in sound. Seven great sounds, each one corresponding to one of the interior stars, or alchemical metals, ur\"i.pr.r\"lted by seven rays descending from the trumpet. Readers familiar with Theosophical terminology will recognize here a reference to the seven great rays which are active in the evolutionary pio\"\"r, we have called the Great Work. The mountains in the background are snow-covered like the height toward which the Fool gazes and the peak whereon the Hermit stands. They represent abstlact thought which finds its purest expression in the science of mathematics. The sea is the final reservoir of those many waters which begin, in Tarot, with the robe of the High Priestess. This is also the Great Sea of the Qabalists, which they call ,,Mother,,, ancl which is connected with Understanding. It is when the Life-power's own perfbct understanding of itself finds expression in and through a human personalily that what is pictured by Key 20 comes to pass. Three coffins float on the sea. They are of stone to represent the physical plane. They are rectangular to show tll'ee dimensions. The three human figures stand up-right in the coffins. The line of their bodies is th's at right angles to the bottom of the coffins. The purpose of this detail is to indicate the mathematical definition of the Fourth Dimension-Jhe dimension which is at right angles to the other three. The woman is the active figtue of the three. She it is who receives the ilfluence of the magical vibrations coming from the trumpet. i{er uplifterJ hancls represent the sublimation of subconscious activities. us080l"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 11 The man stands witli hands folded on his breast. He looks up in silent acloration but does nothing because activity has been transferred from self-consciousness to subconsciousness. The child's uplifted arms give the traditional sign of Typhon, or Apophis, the Destroyer. This is because he represents the rebirth which comes as a result of mastering the destructive principle, personified in Egyptian mythology as Typhon. His mother is Isis, ancl his father is Osiris, in that same Egyptian rny'th. Thus the three figures represent an ancient mystery formula which ends with the names of Isis, Apophis and Osiris. The initials of the three names are I A O, or Yaho, one of the most potent \"words of power\". It is still in use and has direct connection with controlled employment of sound vibration in ways which malce immediate use of the fact of the Fourth dirnension; even though many initiates who are trained in the use of this mystical worcl are not themselves directly aware of the Fourth Dimension. Key 20, tlren, sets the pattern for your own personal realization of immortality. It calls forth subconscious activities which result, at last, in this final liberation. It will help you realize that even now you are living in the For-rr1h Dimension, in that Eternity of wirich time, as measured by man, is only a parlial expression. It r.vill aid you to understand also that just as yol live in Eternity, so do you share the quality of omnipresence which is part of your true make-up because the foundation of your personal life is the fiee Spirit bouncl by neither time nor place. KEY 21. THE WORLD The name of the letter Tav J'l means \"signature\" or,,mark',. In ancient Hebrew, it was often written as we write the plus sign in arithmetic. As representing a signature, Tav implies security, pledge, gualantee, and the like. The signature makes a contract valid. The \"Sign of Tav\" is the final seal and witness of the Great Work. The direction attributed by Qabalists to Tav is Center, sometimes called \"the palace of holiness in the midst\". The idea is that the ruling principle dwells at the center. Administrative Intelligence is therefore attributed to Tav because the Lord's consciousness-the mental state of the originating and directive principle of the universe-is what administers every detail of cosmic activity. When a human"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tNT.RODUCTtON TO TAt?OT: tl being completes the Great Work, his contemporaries slrppose he has acquired unusual control over his environment. He himself knows befter. He has identified himself with the central, directive Principle of the universe. Because this has occurred, his every thought, his every word, his every act is an immediate, undistorted expression of the Conscious Energy which administers the laws of nature. He has not gained power. He simply gives free expression to the One Power which is actually the centralleality in every hurnan life. He participates in the cosmic government. He enters the kingdom of heaven as a fuily enfranchised citizen who takes active part in the execution of the laws. Nature obeys him because he expresses That which is both Author and Lord of nature. HIGHLIGHTS attributes the planet Saturn to Tav. Your personal \"Saturn\" is the interior star corresponding to a center at the base of the spine where the serpent-power is coiled. In mythology, Saturn is father of the gods and eats his chilclren. The meaning is that the rnode of consciousness typified by Saturn and by the letter Tav is one which swallows up all other modes of consciousness. To give any adequate verbal explession to this is impossible. We do what we can when we say tiiat in the ali-embracing Divine Consciousness there can be no trace of the feelins of \"otherness\". Every human being who has tried to express his own experience of this consciousness has tolcl us that in it everything disappears but the sense of identity or oneness. Such starements are unintelligible to ordinary men and women, yet the fact that all seers agree in using this ki'd of language indicates clearly that they have had a common experience. Little as we may be able to imagine such an experience, reason tells us that an order of knowing which is all-inclusive must necessarily be free from the qualification, \"l am I, and the universe is another.,, Key 2l is the expression of the power of 1 thror-rgh the agency of 2.21 expresses the manifestation of self-conscioLlsness through the activity of subconsciousness. Yet, in this instance, the self-consciousness is not personal. It is the self-awareness of the One Identity, and the subconsciousness through which it r,vorks is the all-ilclusive subconscious level of the Life-power's being. This is not easy to explain. Perhaps yoll may glasp the idea if we say the final outcome of the Great Work is really a recollection of powers most persons have forgotten they possess. Among these powers is an extension of consciousness beyond the limits of the body into the forms which constitute one's environment. In this consciousness, the whole universe is USOBO ]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: ll perceived as being the One Body of the One Self. To realize this is to be aware that the directive Center of the whole field of cosmic activity dwells in the heart of man. The title, \"The World,\" is a translation from the Hebrew olahm, meaning \"eternity, universe, world\". The oldest significance of this word is, \"that which is hidden or veiled\". The title of Key 21 indicates also what may be tenned \"world-consciousness\". FIe who learns to express the Administrative Intelligence is in tune with the whole universe. The four animals are the same as those of Key 10. Associated with the fixed signs of the zodiac, they represent the fixed conditions in which all manifestation takes place. They are also symbols for the four elements and for four great planes of manifestation. The idea suggested by their positions in the corners of the Key is that every event is included within the All. The wreath is an ellipse eight units high and five units wide. This presents a formula for the approximate squaring of the circle, and the surn of the numbers 5 and 8 gives the 13 which denotes Unity and Love. The wreath is really a zero-sign. It indicates that the World and the No-Tliing are not two things, but One. The World is the way the No-Thing presents itself to our minds. The dancing figure is the Woman who has appeared throughout the Tarot series. She is so drawn that her head and hands are at the angles of a triangle, apex upward, while her legs form a cross. Thus the figure suggests the alchemical symbol for Sulphur, a triangle over a cross. The Woman is the embodiment of the fiery Life-power. Her dance suggests the Law of Rlythrn which is everywhere at work. She dances on air, just as the Yods hang in air in Keys 16, 18 and 19, This is a reference to the occult doctrine that the real basis and support of all manifestation is Spirit. The spirals in her hands turn in opposite directions. They symbolize the dual operation of the One Force. They ernit flashes of light. They are symbols of the universal spiral force which enters into all forms of cosmic activity. The Woman is tnole than she seems. The traditional interpretation of Tarot says the veil hides the fact that this dancer is male as well as female. THAT WHICH IS, according to the way we think about it, appears now as Father and again as Mother. Yet THAT is limited by neither gender. It includes, and transcends, both male and fbmale. The veil or scarf is shaped like the Hebrew letter Kaph. This is the letter to which Key l0 is assigned. The meaning here is that the mechanism of the universe, which seems like a system of wheels within wheels, hides the truth that whatever exists is an expression of Love and us080 I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT..

He who knows what is behind the veil of mechanism knows that tlie One Power is not only the Life-power, as we have called it so many times. He learns that the Life-power is also the Love-power. This is the final revelation, the consciousness reached at the end of the seven stases of unfoldment. This end, moreover, is also the begiming of a new cycle.
