STRENGTH Key 8 takes us back to nature, away from the associations of lruman artifice connected with Key 7.The lettel attributed to this picture is !1, Teth, rneaning \"selpent\"' Thus in Key 8 there is an echo of what we have seen before in Key 6 where a worlr.an and a serpent were parts of the design' in early manuscripts, the letter Teth looks like a snake with its head turned to the left and its tail curled up ovel its back. Some trace of this persists in the modern form of the letter printed above. Tlius this letter and its Tarot Key are evidently related to the exceedingly complex serpent symbolisrn we find in so many forms throughout the literature of Ageless Wisdorn' spiral, or coiling, is typified by th9 selpent. Yet this same force is the instrument of man's liberation whenever he u'delsta*ds it and uses it aright. on tliis account, two principal syrnbols of this force-the snake and the lion-appear in the Bible as emblem, oiift. Adversary, and also as types of the Redeemer' Exoteric theology makes the mistake of supposing the Redee-., und the Adversary are two irreconcilable antagonists. He who can read between the lines by following the rnany hints given in the Bible, will discover.the truth tirat the same force which the wise employ to realize freedorn from every kind of bondage is also the sanre fo]:ce which, ill.directed, causes all human misery. snakes ale almost universally feared and so is the power they symbolize' They are dangerous to man and often cause his death, yet it has bee' discovered recently that the venom of the cobra has good uses which man never suspected so rong.as rre yielded to his natural instinct to kill snakes on sight. Similarly, the folce the selpent 'y*bolittt is extremely dangerous' and' in some instances, a deadly poiso*. Thus it is natural that ail exoteric religio's make the s'ake a symbol for the devil' STNINGTN us080 l"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTRODIJCTION TO TAROT This is one reason the Bible puts ernphasis on the danger of denying the actual existence of the devil. It warns us repeatedly against the falsity of the easy optimism which believes itself to be protected against all adversity by the silly, childish expedient of declaring that the adversary does not exist. All talk of victory is empty unless there be a leal antagonist to overcome. Even a game of br.idge would be rneaningless were there no opposing sides' So, when we come to deal with the iranifold problem, olhrr*un life, nothing can be more ridicuious than to believe we may escape dang\"i-by pretending it does not exist. We never can solve ploblerns by refusing to face them. Neither ffiay we solve them by vain endeavors to destroy their causes' Like poisonous snakes' or poisOnous weeds, the causes of evil ale to be overcome, and to ovelcome an adversary is to malce hirn an ailY. Thus the message of Key 8 is of particular irnportance to all lovers of freedom and justice' It tells us that the enemy, itto,rgtr dangerous as a deaclly serpent ol a roaring liol' may be transformed into a Powerftil allY' In Key 6, the serpent of temptation is coiled round the tree behind Eve' In Key 8, the same force is pictuled as a red lion, but now tamed by the woman who opens his mouth' That is to say, she makes him articulate, gives hirn speech. The idea here is that whenever we understand any seemingly adverse powef, we can tame it and make it an instrument wheleby we shall be able to express and realize our human aspirations' Step by step, the plogress of science brings the dumb, brute forces of nature under the contlol of human thought, eipr\"ssed in words. ior millenniums, lightni*g was only a type of swift death, and thgnde, *u, mistaken for the voice of an angry God' Today the same lightning canies the human voice in a flash to evety part of the worlcl and has endowed human speech with the univelsal reverbelation and ,.r..Ls which Eliphas Levi prophesied when he wrote of what would occur when men began to master the subtle force symbolized by the letter Teth' and by the lion in KeY 8. The law is sirnple. It is the law that subconsciousness is aiways, and completely' amenable to control by suggestions oliginating at the level of self-consciousness' In Key 8 this is intimated by the fact that the woman weals a white robe similal to that worn by the Magician and has over.1r\", head the same horizontal figure 8 which is shown in I(ey 1' All that we mean by substance, as applied to the basic rnateriai frorn which the variety of forms in our environment is built up, has been demonstrated in our physical laboratories to be \"nothing but\" radiant energy, fundamentally electromagnetic' This streams from our sun to provicle physical energy for our entire world-system' USOSO I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT out of this energy are built all the complex things surrounding us' As we now undelstand it, this energy is a mass of tiny parlicles oI waves moving at terrific rates of speed' The ftrndanental particles are all alike.

Those which enter into the conposition of your bocly are no different from those whicl-r make up the materials of the walli of your house or the Stones and cement of the sidewalks. Every form taken by this energy in our ten'estrial envilonrnent is a form of life and is therefole a form of consciousness. Exoteric science is not quite ready to adrnit this, but comes nearer every year. Ageless Wisdorn has declared it from time immemorial. Everything is alive' Inorganic u, *\"tt as organic forms are built fi'om this \"vital electricity\" which certain oliental occultists call Fohat and which Madarne Blavatsky declared to be represented by the letter Teth. Wherever there is iife, there is some degree of consciousness. The consciousness latent in minerals and vegetables appears to us to be unconsciousness, but the best reports of the wise repudiate the term unconsciousness, and for this reason ws use the word subconsciousness to designate levels of awareness below that of human awareness of a self, or Ego' The law we have mentioned on page 2 says that evely level of conscioustless below that of htunan self- consciousness responds invariably and automatically to suggestions originating at the level of self-consciousness. Put very simply, this means that the enelgy wliich takes form as everything in out' environment may be controlled directly by our mental pfocesses. Through his thought and imagination, man may impose his will upon whatever surounds hirn. He may do this indirectly by imagining various combinations of things outside his body' Yet even here it is the human mind which perceives the possibiiities of such combinations after careful observation of what goes on in some field of investigation' Machines are thought-forms rnaterialized by human imagination' Just as a chair is the projection into physical manifestation of man's idea of sitting, so is an airplane a projection of his thought of flying. when man imagines truly, as a result of following out the steps outlined in Tarot by Keys 0 io 7, the whoie of nature responds to his ideas and brings him a greater measure of fi.eedom, a gl.eater command of the titingr and forces surlounding his body. Ther.e are men and women who have progressed beyond this indilect contloi of the astlal light. They use various instruments for their works of power' and some of the instruments hJue no obvious connection with the results attai'ed. Tarot is one such instrument.

Yet one point we do wish i'o emphasize. The lion is led by a chain of roses and the roses mean just what they mean in Key 1 ald 3. They are symbols of clesire and this is cultivated desire. Wliat is meant by the fact that in Key g they are woven into a chain, is that the subconscious levels of the activity of the cosmic radiant energy are to be controlled by trained, systematic, coherent use of related desires, expressed in clear images.

THE HERMIT A snake belongs to the subhuman, anilral kilgdom. But the lettel r, Yod, printed on Key 9, represents the hand of man. Thus the power we see syrnbolized as a lion in Key 8 is shown on a wide plain with a mountain peak in the background; but the Hermit in Key 9 stands at the summit of that same peak. FIe is male in contrast to tl-re woman of Key 8. The scene is aiso a contrast to the sunlit landscape of Key 8, for the Helmit stands holding a lantern to light the way fol travelers toiling up the path towald the height. 9, the number of this Key, has cerlain properlies like thoseof 0. Muttiply any number by 0, and 0 is always the result. Multiply any numbel by 9, and the product will be always a number having digits which add to 9. Even the shape of tire figure is derived from tire zelo sign, and' as otdinarily written, 9 is simply a zero with a tail, usually a straight line, like the figure 1. Thus, though his outward appealance is diffelent, we find the Herrnit on a rnountain, like the Fool. Th#oo1, however, fixes his gaze on a height ahead of hini. The I{ermit looks down, as if surveying a path leading upward from the depths whence he has clirnbed. Solitude, but not ioneliness, is pictured by this Key. Super'1?ti*y, too, because the Herrnit is on u rrigrr peak and his beard, fteitiat of the Emperor, symbolizes experience' So does the number 9, because it is the last of the series of numerals. 9 typifies completion,. and comptetion applied to human life is the attainment of adeptship and mastery' Thus we may understand that I(ey g is the Tarot symbol of tire perfected state of human consciousness' This perfected state is that of union with the one self. It is tire state of identification with the Master power which is meant whenever the Scriptrues speak of the \"Hand of God\"' Adepts and masters are, in very truth, \"God'S Hands\". So are we, but we are far frOm being steadily aware of this truth. we are like the hands of little children, full of potentiality' but wanting in practical skili. we have the powefs, but we are, as yet, deficient in training' Yet, even in our relative inefficiency' we are God's hands' For evely wolk of man' whether it be done in wisdom or in ignorance, is a direct transformation of power descending fi'om the One Self. INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: us080 I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 5 This is what the rays of the Hermit's lantern signify. Every man and woman on this pianet is connected with the One Self by a ray of the cosmic liglrt. Nole of us lives oI moves' but by this power. All persolal action is really a response to impulses coming dowu to us ti'orn this \"Father of Lights\". Thus the supreme conscious attairunent is the realization that the One Self is also the only Self. .,persons\" seem to be separate, and think they have separate \"selves\". Yet he who really knows the Self knows there is no other'. This is why Key 9, representing, among other things, the completion of human attairunent, shows an old man standing alone' The zodiacal sigl attributed to Yod is Virgo, the sixth sign, aud the six-pointed star in the lantern is an allusion to the number of this sign in the zodiacal selies. In ancient pictorial representations, Vilgo was often shown as a woillan holding a distaff and a sheaf of wheat' This was an allusion to the fact that the human bocly is woven, so to spcak, from tlueads spun in the small intestine, which, say the astroiogets, is governed by virgo. It is in this region that oru food (symbolized by the sheaf of wheat) is clianged into the basic substance from which the blood is charged with the rnaterials needed fol the lepair and functioning of our bodies. As we shall explain in greater detail, in lessons which follow this course in the B.O.T.A. cuniculum, the heights of acleptship are reached as a result of minute alterations in the chemistry and structttre of the physicai body of man' Outwardly, an adept looks like any other member of the human race; but his blood is different, his organs functiol better, and wl-rat are rudimentary structures in most human skr-rlls are fully ftinctioning organs in the brain of a fuily libelated master of life' The place where the fu'ciame'tal difference between an adept's body and that of ar-r ordinary man is determined is in the region governed bY Virgo. This sign is nrled by Mercury, and in Tarot, Mercury is the Magician' What this means is that it is poisible, by inielligent contr-ol of the body-building process, to effect great changes in the chemistry of the blood and in the functions of various physical organs. Basically, the making of such. changes dePends: I . on conscious knowiedge of the use of self-consciollsness for the light selection of food; Z. on the use of the law pictured in Key 8 to transfer to subconsciousness the pattern of a higher and finer type of pliysical organism' The most important lesson of Key 9 is summed up in the word response' It is the lesson rve must learn, that no act of human pelsonality is self-oliginated. Perhaps a play on words may help you grasp the idea. No act oipersonality originates in what most persons mean when they say,.seif,. AII acts of personality are truly Self-oliginated, because they have tl\"reil souce in the over-shadowing life of the One Self' us080l"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT Just as the Hermit, looking down, sees those who are climbing toward him, so the One Self enters into the lives of us all. To ourselves we seem to be struggling upward and few of us seem to be aware of any ligirt fi'om above; but the One Self knows all its personal 'ranifestations and *oikr iluough every one to bring about that person's conscious union with the Suprerne. We have said before that no human being is a puppet. Because a1l our personal activity is rooted in the fi.eedorn of the One Life, this freedom entels into all that we are or do. We misinterpret and misunderstand it, but we are correct in our instinctive belief in free will' For this responsive quality in all human action does not mearl response to something outside, or to ,o*\"t6ing other than oulselves. It is a personal reaction to our true, innertnost nature. The Her.'rit on his peak stands at tl-re centeL of a great circle. His horizon is wider than that of a'y of the travelers toiling up towald hirn. The paths on one side of the mountain are diffelent from those on the opposiG side, and seem to be going in opposite directions. Yet they all meet in one place.
