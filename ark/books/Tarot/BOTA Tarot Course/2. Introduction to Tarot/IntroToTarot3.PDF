[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT Lesson Three KEY 4. THE EMPEROR Probably the earliest houses had but one apefiure in the wall, which opening was both door and window. Later came the idea of having a special opening to adniit light and air and to permit observation of persons approaching. Thus the letter Heh i1, whose nalne means \"window\", foliows logically after Daleth, the door. There is also a logical reason for putting the Emperor after the Empress. A man cannot be master of his household until his mate has had children. Actual fatherhood is a conseouence of what the mother brinss into the world. The generation of mental irnages at the level of self- consciousness (Empress), is a necessary forerumer to reason (Emperor). Until we have something to regulate, we cannot set our mental house in order. All meanings of tlie number 4 are lelated to order because 4 con'esponds to the square. Regulation and supervision are implied by everything in Key 4. Supervision is overseeing. Thus the function of sight is attributed to Heh and the Emperor. The rnartial aspect of the Emperor is obvious. Here is a man of war clad in armor. He sits on a cube like the High Priestess, but the stone bears a ram's head, and this, with the same design on his shoulder and the symbol at the top of his helmet, relates to the astrological couespondence to Aries, first sign of the zodiac, which is represented in the Hebrew alphabet by the letter Heh. (Aries rules the head and the function of sight). Among our senses sight is chief. By it we regulate our lives and our world. The quality of our vision determines the course of our progress toward libelation. Unless we imagiue, we do not really see. So true is this that even physical vision requires more than correct optical functioning of the eyes and tlr.eir brain-centers. Occasionally a man born blind receives his siglit, but after this occurs he must spend some months in learning to see. For him there is no diffelence in appearance between a globe and a circle. Persous walking toward him seem to grow as they approach. Until imagination based on other senses"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 3 enables him to supplement what his eyes report, he has no true vision of the world on which his eyes have opened. We have all passed tluough this experience, but because we learned these lessons in infancy we have forgotten that we had to learn to see just as surely as we had to learn to walk. The mind is the true seer. The eyes ale only its tools, and all tools need skillful handling. In Heblew, the letter Heh serves the sarne puryose as the English definite article the. Hence this lefter stands for the mental activity whereby we single out particular things and distinguish them from others more or less like them. Thus classification is one basic meaning of Key 4. The Empelor represents this ordering process of our minds wheleby we control the conditions of our environment. Such control is not the irnposition of our fancies on the world. We never force nature into obeying us. On the contrary, she seles us at a price. We must see things as they are. Definition must square with fact. Reasoning must be a development of acculate observation. Then imagination will be true and vision will be precipitated iirto our envirorunent as actual physical things and conditions. They who gave us Tarot, and they who now compose that Inner School which has kept alive the wisdorn behind Talot, see truly and reason correctly. Their vision of w-hat ihe earth may be when man unfolds a bettel understanding of hirnself and of his environment, is recorded in these Keys. One of the n:rost valuable results of Tarot study is that by it rnan's consciousness is enriched and transformed so that he learns to see the tme world which lies hidden behind the veils of superficial appeal'ances. Liberation, remember, is indefinitely progressive. If we may accept tlie words of those who are believed by ma.ny to be Masters of the Wisdorn, even they have their problems. To us they may seem almost as demigods, but their sirnple language makes it perfectly clear that they have no such illusions about themselves or their attainments. Where they diffel plincipally fi'om many of us is in theil vision of man a.nd their vision of nature. They know what is in man having found it in thernselves. They understand that nature is always for man, never against hirn. So they do easily what most of us have not yet dreamed of doing, yet nothing they have accomplished is leally beyond olu' powers. Not one of thern is beguiled by the fancy that everything would be all right if only the world were ordered in accordance with some systen-political, economic, or technological. Provide the best arrangement of things you can and entrust it to the management of men and women who have no vision. It will fail. Does this mean we have no faith in any system? Does it mean, to be specific, that the increasingly difficult endeavor to pleselve the institutions our forefather's gave their all to us080 I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT. establish less than two hundred years ago, is, after all, a meaningless struggle? Far from it. Just the contrary. Every seer and prophet of whorn we have any record looked fiorward to what was begun by the Declaration of Independence, confu'med by the Constitution, and set forlh in the heraldry of the United States of Arnerica. No, what we are tlying to make cleal now is that to have tlue vision is to be free, even though the greater part of mankind suffers the pains consequent to ignorance. Free from most of the disabilities which burden the rank and file of humanity. Free from want, disease, and fear. Free fiom death itself. No system confels this freedom. It comes fi'om our inner consciousness, not fi'orn outside. Key 4, like all the Tarot keys, speaks to you in picture language. We all know this language even though our surface consciousness may not be aware of this fact. This Key, again like all the Keys, brings you a mighty Truth, a great and comforting message. It tells you that now and not at some future time, you are the master of all your circumstances and environmental conditions. No matter what appearances to the contlary there may be, the truth is that your personal world, just as it presents itself to you at this very moment, is the world you have made for yourself. You rnay not like it, but you made it. Because you made it, you are able to remold it as Omar said, \"nearer to the heafi's desire.\" The same Omar knew, and said, that they who remold worlds must begin by shaffering thern to bits. Key 4 will help you to do this and here is one of the lessons to be leamed from the strong Mals quality pictured by this image of the Emperor. True vision and light definition destroy before they build. Thus Eliphas Levi taught that he who knows how to direct the cunents of the Great Magical Agent (pictured by the Fool) \"can reduce the world to a chaos and transform its face.\" The false world of an ignorant man's toftured fancy does not actually exist. It has no rnore reality than any other nightmare. Yet we have all experienced bad dleams and lorow how dreadfully acute may be their fancied terrols. Use Key 4 to wake you from the dream that you are a slave to circumstance . . . to free you fi'om the delusion that anything you have thought, or said, ol done in days gone by can rob you of your heritage of freedom. This picture of a monarch ruling ail his kingdom is a true portrait of your own real Self. Let it bring to the surface of your mind the knowledge of who and what you really are. us080 t"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT KEY 5. THE HIEROPHANT The number 5 sits in the middle of the row of numerals fiom l to 9. Occupying this middle place, it suggests intervention, mediation, and similar ideas. A mediator serves as a link between two opposing groups. In Tarot, Key 5 is such a link between four pails of pictures-l and9,2 and 8, 3 and 7, and 4 and 6. In later courses you will learn more about this. The letter Vav '1, printed on Key 5, has the same suggestions. Its name lneans \"nail\" or \"hook\". Thus it indicates: 1. What joins together the parts of a whole, as nails unite the parts of a house; 2. What serves to suspend a hanging object, as a hook supporls a picture. The gramrnatical use of Vav in Hebrew is based on the meanings of the name of the letter. Vav serves the same purpose as the English conjunction \"and\". It linl<s together a series ofnouns and serves also as the hook, or support, from which hang tl're dependent clauses of a sentence. The function associated with Vav is Hearing. This refers prirnalily to oldinary physical sensation because hearing is truly the principal link between one human mind and another. In these days we hear through our eyes, one might say, because the Western world uses symbols fol sounds in all its printed texts. This is not so in China and Japan. Hence in lands dorninated by Chinese picture-writing the written wold is far mole potent than the spoken. Physical hearing, however, is not the only meaning of Vav. This letter stands for a more important fuirction. This is the interior hearing whereby we may know the Voice of the trLre Self pictured here by the Flierophant. In our B.O.T.A. texts, we always use a capital \"V\" when wliting of this Voice. It must be distinguished fi'om the \"voices\" which come from othel rninds or from discarnate entities on the astral plane. We are far from discounting the value of interior communication with other entities whether they be incarnate or discarnate. Yet none of these \"voices\", however wise may be their counsel, is the Voice. As one has written, this is a Voice which speaks where thele is none to speak. It is the Voice of the One Self and the knowledge and wisdom it imparts have no tinge of human fallibility. Thus the type of consciousness to which Key 5 coresponds, as the table on page 48 of HIGFILIGHTS tells you, is named \"The Triumpl-rant and Etelnal Intelligence\". us0801"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT, Triumphant, because its counsel always helps us overcome some obstacle, or avoid some dalgei, or transform some seemingly adverse circumstance into friendly cooperation with our efforts. Etemal, because this counsel is based always on eternal plinciples. Never is it merely a thing of the moment. Simply to open our irurer ears is not enough. There are enetnies as well as fi'iends of man on the astral plane. Mischief-makers, also, who delight in perplexing and confusing those who listen to their voices. Yet they always betray themselves by certain characteristics. First of all, they flatter'. Subtly and in just the ways to which one is most susceptible. They flatter by \"revealing\" mysteries which, they say, are l-ridden from the rest of the world. One of their commonest forms of deception is to make supposed revelations of the details of former incarnations. For those of grossel wits, they say, \"Once you were Cleopatra,\" or Napoleon, or some other prominent figule in history. To others, though they do not resoft to such open flattery, they find the way to domination by revelations of supposed incarnations, not particularly striking in themselves, yet seeming to lender plausible the idea that one's present shortcomings are a natural outcome of fonner lives, and therefore to be condoned. The purpose of such supposed revelations is to establish the hearer's confidence in those who give the communications. Their sources of information are tremendous. It is not generally i*o*tt that only the limitations of physical embodiment conceal our past experiences from others. They who live on the astral plane, and use the astral senses, can read our lives from the cradle onward. Names, dates, even our private thoughts and feelings, are engraved on what is pictured in Tarot as the scroll of the High Priestess-and this record is an open book to many inhabitants of the astral plane. Thus the accuracy of any spilit's revelatioir of your past is by no rneans a guarantee olhis good faith, nor of his ability to guide you in the present toward a successful futur.. Some such entities are well-meaning and beneficent, but a man does not become a Master simply by shedding his physical envelope. Lots of well-meaning persorls hele give very bad advice, and they keep on giving it when they pass to the \"otheL side\". Whenever.you heal a voice demanding that you sliall obey its orders, stop your ears' The Voice never demands, never flatters, never says anything to increase your sense of self- imporlance. Furthermore, every principle it announces may be checked by reason- Sometimes the r.evelations of the Voice go beyond reason and beyond ordinary experience. Yet in no silgle instance do they rur counter to reason and they meet the tests of investigation. The geleral meaning of Key 5, tiren, is summed up in the word intuition, in the sense of .,inside tuition\", oL \"interior teaching\". In the symbols of this Key we find all we need to know i1 order to distinguish genuine intuitions from baseless feeiings which echo ouL own emotional states and give form to our ignorance' us080 I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT It is logical for Key 5 to follow Key 4. Genuine intuition is not a substitute for reason. It is a logical consequence of good reasoning. It does not teach the lazy-minded. Whenevel a person tells you he cloes not need to study because intuition tells him everything he needs to know, he is usually a liar. Certainly he deceives himself. The Imer Teacher wastes no time in fi'uitless endeavors to instruct the incompetents who will not take the trouble to observe, to retnertber, to imagine, and to reason. Thus the ministers kneeling before their teacher wear garments wliich are ernbroidered with the same flowers that appear in the garden of the Magician. They represent personal acquisitions of knowledge (lilies) and personal development and cultivation of desires (roses)' There are echoes in the symbolisrn, also, of what is portrayed in the picture of the High Priestess. Like her, the Hierophant sits between two pillars in a temple. Like her, he has a lunar symbol prominently displayed. Even the ornaments on the back of his throne have some resemblance to her crown, though they are intended primarily to represent the zodiacal sign Taurus. Actually, the Emperol and the Hierophant are the same. The difference between them is in their spheres of operation. In Key 4, all the emphasis is on the objective, external wolld from which man gathers experience. In Key 5, the ernphasis is on the inner realm whence man gains his wisdom and his knowledge of the significance of what goes on round hirn. These are often called two worlds. Actually they are just the outside and the inside of one world. The one is not more real, nor more true, than the other. More than this, either realm, taken by itself, is incomplete, and, to that extent, is really false. They are in error who suppose the wor'ld outside, reporled to us through oul senses, is the only real world. Not less mistaken are they who deny reality to the objective univetse and fly frorn it ilto the inner realms. The onter world is devoid of meaning apart fi'om the inner one. The wisdom of the inner world is Dead Sea fi'uit unless it be put to use and service in the realnl outside. Besides looking at the Hierophant, then, and caliing up his image whenevel you ale confronted by a problem to which you can find no solution after you have done all you can in the way of observing, remembering, irnagining and reasoning, practice the listening attitude of mind. The Voice never speaks loud and you will fail to hear it until you have learned to silence the clamor of your own thinking, most of which is rnerely taiking to yourself' Just take your problem to the One Teacher and listen to what FIe may have to say. This does not mean that you will, necessarily, hear an audible voice, especiaily in the beginning of your practice. Later on, if you persist, you will really hear the Voice, and, having had the experience once, you will never rnistake the Voice for the \"Voices\". us080 I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: The fr.urdagrental practice is to be stiil when you wish the counsel of the Voice. Stop ::aclcing your brains when a seemingly insoluble ploblem confi'onts you. The halder you try, the less iitcety are you to hear the answer. For in Key 5 there is a sfi'ong element of what is pictured by the l-Iigh Priestess and the same need for quiet calmness' The leason behind this is that every great principle, every eternal truth, is already part of the wisdom of your true Self. Intuition is really a sort of recollection. It brings up treasures of wisdom bgried deep in the race subconsciousness. More than this, it brings down new treasures from the superconsciousness above the personal level ofself-conscious awareness. Always the price of these revelations is silence. You cannot listen if you are talking to yourself. us080 t"}]
