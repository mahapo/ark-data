THE HIGH PRIESTESS As Beth, the House, is a contrast to Aleph, the Ox, and as the number 1 is a contrast to zero, so are the letter and number of the High Priestess antitheses to those of the Magician. Gimel ), tneans \"camel\", and suggests ttavel, comnterce, the carrying of news from one place to another', and so on. These ideas are opposite to those of fixed location, and the \"stay-at- honle\" attitude which are among the associations of the word t'house\", In the doubling or duplication which 2 implies, we have, again, a contrast to the singleness of 1. Combined with the ideas suggested by \"catnel\", 2 gives us the notion of the two extremes of a joumey, its beginning and end; of the two parties necessary to strike a bargain in commerce; and of the two concemed with news. those who heal and those who tell. Thus even this slight consideration of tire meanings of Gimel and 2 shows tliat they are lelated to the Higli Pliestess. This wortan in hel place between two contrasting pillals at the doolway of a temple, is a picture of what tnodern Ps),chology calls subconscious ol subjective mind. Look at this ca1m, seated woman. The Fligh Pliestess is passive, receptive, and, by ancient meanings of the title, virginal, She is, moreover, concemed with recolds of the past as her book or scroll makes evident. In prehistoric times, these records were unwritten. They wele transmitted orally. Thus they were all cornmitted to memoty. Tire wlitten word is sirnpiy artificial memoly. Proper sequence of teaciring in these graded courses of instruction on the spiritual significance and practical use of the 22Tarot Keys has been carefully plamed, Filst it is necessary to become faruiliar with the form aspect of the Tarot Keys as given in this introductory course. In the coulse irnmediately following this one (Tarot Fundamentals), the student is required to color the Tarot Keys. This later correlation of forrn with color in the archetypal language of the Tarot develops a heightening ofthe senses and has such a plofound effect on subconsciousness, that old frozennegative patterns become readily accessible to us080l"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO 7-AROT: 2 transrnutation. All experience and awareness becomes intensified and this is preparation for direct spiritual awareness and expanded consciousness which goes with it. Careful tests conducted in the fields of hypnotic and reverie regression have fully demonstrated that subconsciousness retains and remembers everything . . .yâ‚¬s, everything down to the smallest and seemingly insignificant detail. It records the trivial and useless just as well as the significant parts of what we experience. No ciear impression escapes being written on the scroli of the High Priestess. Subconscious memory is perfect and therefore cannot be imploved, Memory is the basic powel of subconsciousness and the High Pliestess surlls up in the details of her syrnbolisrn all anyone need know in order to make maximum and practical use of melnoly. Note that we say practical use. To clutter up our conscious minds with the unimportant and trivial details contained in our subconscious memoly is just as bad as failure to remernber the significant and important items of our experience. Indeed, severai mental diseases are characterized by too perfect recollection. What we can develop by intelligent use of Key 2 is our power of recollection, our ability to duplicate past experiellces, our skill in use of the laws whereby mental irnages are grouped together in our subconscious filing system. Such skiil presupposes concentration and attention, the mental activities associated with the Magician. Much of what is called faulty memoly is just want of attention. Substitute for the scroli a motion pictr,rre film and this blings the syrnbol up-to-date. If the carnera be badly focused, or not even pointed at what is going on, the pictures will either be dim, or the film will be blank. Hence the first requisite to better powers of recollection is to make sure of being alive and alert to what is going on around us. We must be \"here\"; or we shall be sure to forget. Now look at the High Pliestess and you will see that she is perfectly quiet, perfectly passive. This is the first requirement for good recollection. Strain to remember something, and it reftises to lise to the surface of youl mind. Just sit still and lelax and you will find the needed information lising easily to the surface provided only that the first impression was clear and sharply defined. We know no remedy for blun'ed,hazy images except a change from slovenly inattentiveness to deliberate determination to be fully alive to what goes on during every waking moment. Artificial mnemonic systems are of little value except for mental tricks. Give your subconsciousness a cllance by furnishing it witli clear images as you go along and its automatic filing system will soon put your mental house in older, us0801"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: We say automatic because the laws of recall do work automatically. We mahe them useless by inattention. We interfere with their operation when we strain and struggle to remetnber. If we know what they are and Iet them do their work, we shall be able to recall anything we may require. I{ey 2 syrnbolizes all the laws of recall. The two pillars ale alike in shape because we naturally group together whatever images ale like one another. Yet these pillals are opposite in color because a second iaw of association is that of contlast. Think of light and you think also of darlaress. Mutt's lanky length calls up the squat chubby fonn of Jeff. So similarity and contlast are both symbolized by the pillars because these two laws always act together. A third law is recency. Other things being equal we recall easiest what we have nost recently experienced. The latest news, the furury story we heard this afternoon, the interesting display in some window we passed an hour ago, all these we recall without effort. The High Pdestess does not have to llrn her scroll to lead what she has just recorded' The fourth law is the law of repetition, and this is not only directly related to the number 2 but has several other representations in the valious details of the design. If you are interested in tracing tirem, by all meal1s do so. You will find aids to this in HIGHLIGHTS, but unless yollrs is the analytical student temperament, remernbel this is not necessary in order to make use of this I(ey. You know that anl.thing frequently lepeated is easy to recall. Give the casual glance most of us grant to a new acquaintance, and a second rneeting rnay call forth no flash of recollection. See a man day after day and you lecognize him even at a distance. The fift}r law is intensity. We remember our first experietlces of this or that because they received full voluntary attention. Childhood is theretbre mote vivid tiran yesterday, but if we learn to renew oul youtlr-and the secret of this is in tiie reconditioning we achieve through use of the Tarot Keys-we shall once more live deeply and fully and shall have vivid rnemolies instead of the hazy impressions we are content with now. As we have said, artificial mnemonic systems are of little value. The reason is that all of them are arbitrary. One popular system of this kind is based on association of rvords with nurnbels. It enables persolts patient enough to master rtto dazzle their acquaintances with pyiotecluic displays of meinory. Yet even expefts in these trick systems admit that what real value the system possesses is to be found in the fact that, in a roundabout way, it exercises our basic powers of lecollection. Tarot itself is, among othel things, olle of the best mnemonic systems . . . one that is valuable because its association clues are not arbitrary. By the time you finish this course, you will possess twenty-two sharply defined mental pictures, each associated with a nutnber. Think of a picture and you will see the numbel printed on the Key neal the title. Think of a number and the picture wiil flash instantly befole your mind's eye. No efforl is needed. Numbers and pictules go naturally together. us080 I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 2 Since the associations are not arbitrary, it is possible to make the Tarot sequence the basis for a wonderful aid to recollection. Suppose, for instance, you have five things you must do without fail tornon'ow. It takes no time, and little effort, to link these activities, by means of visual images, to the first five Talot Keys. Begin by making a list. Get the things you have to do into proper order. Suppose the first is to see your physician. You might imagine the word DOCTOR written in large, white letters on the Fooi's wallet. The more fantastic the association, the easier tire recollection. If the second thing you have to do is to attend to some correspondence, you rnight imagine a big pen lying on the Magician's table with the rest of his implements. Or pelhaps the image of a pile of letters on the same table may suggest itself. It does not matter what, so long as the image is directly related to what you desile to remember. As a rule the first picture that comes is best. In the same way you may organize the main headings of a speech so that you will realize to the full the truth of Eliphas Levi's promise that Tarot is the key to the oratorical art. Just put the headings in order and look for some pictorial element in each. Then associate what you find with the Tarot Key comesponding by number with the heading' No one needs notes to speak in public. Using them is just a bad habit. Rely on your memoly even though you may stumble at first. Before long you'll be able to say whatever yott have to say to a thousandjust as easily as to one' Be careful not to jump ahead of this course in order to acquit'e the mnemonic system we have jlst described. During the tluee days covered by this part of the lesson and for the present, make your use of Talot for lecollection training nothing other than your five minute session with the Fligh Pliestess. Remember, Tarot speaks a pictorial language you know subconsciously. You do not have to learn it. What you are learning is how to make conscious use of this subconscious treasure house. You have only to let yourself be spoken to tlu'ough your eyes. Even thrlee days with the Higlr Priestess will clo wonders in the way of rraking youl subconsciousness rcaltze that you expect it to put at your disposal its wonderful power of associating ideas. After three days, whenever you want to recall something, sit down quietly for a few moments and bring before youl mind's eye the picture of Key 2 with the express intention of recalling what you desire. Be as relaxed as you can. Don't cast about in your mind fol the desired piece of information. Just look mentally at this irnage of the Perfect Recorder of all experience.

THE EMPRESS With the lellel pdnted on I(ey 3 we are back horne from our journey on the camel of association, back at the door of the house. For the meaning of 't, Daleth, is \"door\". Hence we know that in Key 3, though the syrnbolism is predorninantly feminine, we are once more at the self-conscious level of activity. And sure enough the Empress, like the Magician, is in a garden and red roses ale prominent features of the scene. Yet there is an echo of the preceding Key. Fol the Empress is not only a woman, but is also a seated figure like the High Priestess. She is in sharp contrast to the High Priestess also for she is a wife, and the Tarot tradition says she is a pregnant mother, by implication the wife of the Emperor whose picture follows hers in the series. Your tables in HIGHLIGHTS will tell you the High Priestess corresponds to the Moon, related in mythology to chaste, vilgin for who cannot see the comection between acts of memory and Diana, lady of the moon? The Empress is a sea-bom Venus, traditional patroness of childbirth and mistress also of beauty and of the arts. Key 3 is by number the sum of 1 and 2, or a symbol in the Tarot series of the Magician's union witli the High Priestess whereby the cold virginity of Diana is transformed into the rich fertility of Venus, astrological correspondence to I(ey 3. This fertility, be it remembered, though its immediate agent is subconsciousness, the ferninine member of the two aspects of pelsonal consciousness, has its field of operation in the realm of self-consciousness. Fol the Empress is irnagination, the mind's power to make new combinations from the store of remembeled experiences. Associated rightly, thelefore, with Daleth, the door, because creative imagination is truly the entrance to new life ancl to new worlds. See how true to yout'own mental nature tliis Tarot sequence is. A1l your mental and other powers ale specializations of the limitless Life-power pictured by the Fool. A power whicli can, and does, assume all solts of particular fonns. What forms it does assume are the ones to wirich you pay attention. What you make the object of your attention is what you become, sooner or later.

Change the patterns by attending to tlieil opposites, and presently creative imagination, syrnbolized by the Empress, will begin to build you a new life and will impress even the conditions of your environment with new ideas. No mystical theory, this. It is sober fact attested by the accumulated experience of ages. Again, this process is almost automatic. If you do the first thing needful, the rest follows of itself. Look at youl problem closely and you will discover the answels in the problem itself. More than this, yoru'memory record, as you continue this wise approach to all experience, will be enliched by numerous clear Realizations of the way things really are, instead of being cumbered with useless repetitions of the way things look. In consequence of this, the combining and associative power of subconsciousness will make you aware of new irnages continually. Your mind will be fertile as the Empress' garden, and you wiil reap a wondelful halvest of ideas. Tiris is by no means a fancy pictnre, neithel is there any particular difficulty about it. The yoke of the true Law of Life is easy. Rest fol mind and healt are assured for those who are pelsistent enough to keep facing forward on the Path until it leads them out of the fogs of appearance into the clear Light of true Realization. All the wise have understood the power of imagination. None have expressed it better than Eliphas Levi whose words were inspired by this Tarot picture of the Empress. We pass them on to yott because we know nothing moie useful at this stage of your wolk. \"The understanding and the will of rnan are instruments which are incalculable in their power' and capacity. But the wiil and understarrding have an auxiiiary instrument in a faculty wirich is too little undelstood . . . I speak of the imagination. \"Imagination is actr-rally as the eye of the soul, and it is therein that fomrs are delineated and preserved; by its means we behold the reflections of the invisible wolld. It is the minor of visions and the apparatus of rnagical life. Theleby we clrre disease, modifr the seasons, ward off death from the living, and resuscitate those who are dead, because this faculty exalts the will and gives it power over the universal agent. \"Imagination determines the form of the child in its mother's womb, it gives wings to contagion, and points the weapons of warfare. Ale you exposed in a battle? Believe youlself as invulnerable as Achilles and you wiil be so, says Palacelsus. Fear attracts bullets, and courage turns them back on tl-reir path. \"There is no invisible world, there are merely various degrees in the perfection of organs.

What we call the imagination in man is the inherent faculty of the soul to assirrilate to itself the images and reflections contained in the living light. These images and reflections are revelations when science intervenes to disclose to us their Logos ol light. \"The man of genius differs from the dreamer and the rnadman in this only, that his cleations are analogous to truth, wliile those of madmen and dreamers ale lost reflections and wandering irnages. Thus for the sage to imagine is to see, as for the magician to speak is to create . . . The seer knows with an absolute knowledge that the things he imagines are true, and experience invaliably confirrns his visions.\" Powers like those Levi describes may seem to be far beyond your present attairunents. Yet no sage ever lived who was not once where you are now, no adept walks the earth today (and many are now living in all parts of tlie world) who was not once beset by the same delusions whicli are the causes of whatever miseries you may suffer now. The rich fertility, the cahn peace and happiness, the abiiity to older all things aright, which are pictuled in Key 3 are not something for you to acquile. They ale inalienable possessions which it is your light, and more than your right, your duty, to put to use. Let your conternplation of this Key begin for you the plocess of renewal. Like this huppy, radiant woman, your inner life is even now forrning the image and likeness of a nerv personality. It does not rnatter what your past has been. Your future is yours to cleatel To build the meaning of this Key of Tarot into your very flesh and blood is to set in motion forces which, though at first they wolk almost imperceptibly below the surface, will inevitably bling to pass ftilfilhnents far beyond the best of your present expectations. As yet, we add nothing in the way of practical rnetliods to the instruction given in Lesson 1. Sirnply look at these two Keys during the coming week, five minutes a day. As you look, summon whatever knowledge you may have gathered as to the wonder'ftil power of that silent potency, Light, to aid you to understand that \"meLe looking\" is actually directed use of the same ladiant enelgy rn4rich is the basic substance of the entile physical universe. There is nothing you know that is not made of light. There is no force or power you employ which is not a transforrnation of titat same illirnitable radiance. No matter how much you utlbze, there is always room fol more. Infinity is inexhaustible. Sirnple the practice is . . . too simple for some types of mind who are of the opinion that nothing can be effective unless it be fuli of sound and fury.
