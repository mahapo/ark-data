Key 12 is the most important emblem in Tarot. Tlr.e application of this Law of Reversal is one of the gleat seclets of occultispr. The essential meaning of the law may be stated as follows: To reverse the conditions of misery, disease and failure, and substitute for them their opposites of health, happiness and success, it is necessary to think, speak and act in ways which are the reverse of those in which most persons think, speak and act. One ancient statement of the Law of Reversal is given at the beginning of THE DHAMMAPADA, an important surnmary of Buddha's doctrine: ..A11 that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain followi hito as the wheel foilows the foot of the ox that draws the caniage. ..All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on oul thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him like a shadow that never leaves him' ..Hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love. This is an oid rule'\" Yet it is not enough to say, \"If you want to be happy and successful, you must learn to reverse you1thinkirrg.\" Whut we require is a practical method which will actually effect the necessary levelsal. Riglit use of Key 12 is such a method. Just looking at this picture will do wonders in the way ofieversing our.oldinary habits of thought and speech; but to get the full suggestive power of the picturellto operation, it is well to have some lanowledge of its meaning and correspol.l\"nr.r. W6.n these are understood, they form a bridge which carties the suggestions of the design tnore easily into our subconsciousness. Thele they set going trains of mental activity which will make habitual a mental attitude that does actually change our thought, olu us080t"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 7 speech and our action into the reverse of that which is the underlying cause of the misery and bondage we want to overcome. The lettel Mem lJ printed on this I(ey is the equivalent of the English \"M\". Its name means seas. or water. Water is the first mirror, but it reflects every4hing upside down. It revelses the images cast upon it. This fact led the inventors of Tarot to connect the symbolism cf Key 12 with the letter Mem. The occult watel is not the fluid we draw from kitchen taps. It is called water because it is like that element. It is spread over a vast expanse, like a great sea. It moves itl waves. It flows in curlents and forms itself into whirlpoois, or vortices. It also takes form in drops, or colpuscles' In shofi, the occult water is the Astral Fluid, the electromagnetic energy which is the substance of all things. It is called the seed of minerals because every mineral is cornposed of atoms and every atom contains a certain number of corpuscles, or drops, of this plimary substance. This appalently abstract idea has immediate use. Many practical marvels of recent invention have been made possible by the development of the conception of the electricai constitution of matter. But what difference does this make to an oldinaty human being? Only a few of us have any talent for invention. Only a few are equipped to underlake the difficult labor of a research physicist or chemist. Yet we are all interested in getting more out of life. Will this doctrine help gs to do so? Will it enable us to make better progless, to enjoy betler health, to live freer lives? Let's see. One thing which makes mental and occult practice difficult is the supposition that what we have to do demands the exertion of an intangible mental power against the inertia of a very tangible pliysical reality. This \"matter\" suffounding us is so dense, so resistant, so hard to rnove, that rnost persons cannot believe that rnere tliinking has any power over it. A practical occultist is not deceived by surface appearances. FIe knows that physical things have neither the solidity nor the inerlia his senses repoft. He understands that the densest kilds of physical substance, as well as the lightest gases, are fonns built up fi'om tiny, widely separated \"drops\" of th.e cosmic \"water\". Thus, when he begins to attaclc the practical problem of changing conditions by changing his thinking, he does not face the difficulty which besets a person who believes what his senses report concerning things in his envilonment. Practical occultists know there is no essential dilferelce between the energy which takes form as thought and that which takes form as a diamond or a piece of metal. us0801"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT, Thus the occult teaching about water enables us to effect a reversal of our mental attitude toward the conditions of our environment. By means of this reversal we free our minds from that subjection to appearances which prevents most persons from using thought-power to change conditions for the better' The Tarot reading of 12 indicates the outpouring of the powers of subconsciousness (2) tluough the fixation of self-consciousness in acts of attention (1). This is plecisely what the Hanged Man typifies. When concentration is prolonged, the direct expelience of the ,.rp.i.orrr.ious state of being results, This is per\"fect union of the personal with the universal consciousness. It is attained by practices which quiet the mir,d and suspend the foflnation of chains of ideas. By parapluasing the title of I(ey 12 as \"The Suspended Man\", it becomes evident that this Key refers to such pr.actice. The inventors of Tarot knew the relationship between the nouns man and mind. So they chose a title which hints at the idea of the suspension of personal activities. This suspension is achieved by concentration and leads to the release of marvelous powers which gi,r\" un adept perfect control over his mind, iris body, and the conditions of his environment. He who has this experience rever:ses his attitude toward life. He feels himself to be a vehicle or instrument for-the manifestation of the lirnitless power of the cosmic Life-Breath. Gone forever is the delusiol that personality is, or can be, separate from the sum-total of universal activity. When Jesus said, .,Of myself I can do nothing,\" he expressed this realization. The words are no confession of weakless. They simply tell the truth that even the least of personal actions is a particular rnanifestation of universal laws and forces. Instead of lessening the irnpodance of perso'ality, this realization aclds to that impoftance. It shows that the true value of personality is to be found in the fact that a person is an agency wheleby the limitless power of the One Life may be brought to bear in controlling the conditions in this field of relative existence. In tlre symbolism of l(ey 12,the gallows is in the folm of a Heblew letter Tav, ft. This letter has been mentioned elsewhere in our lessons as being the letter corresponding to Key 21, The World. This Key syrnboiizes the real world which is hidden frorn the ignorant by their delusions. FIe who succeeds in reversing his conception of personality realizes that the real worid is, so to say, the body of God. He i<nows liirnself to be a member of that body' He knows there is nothing anywhere in the real wolld which is inimical to man, or opposed to man's welfare' He deperids utterly on the per.fectly adequate support given by that leal world to all his personal uriiuiti., and interests. The logic of the average human being, who bases his reasoning on super.ficial appealances is just the opposite to the logic of an adept, wiro knows inner realities' us080 I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 7 The average human being is dominated by his irnagination alld his images are false. What he actually does when he supposes himself to be reasoning is nothing but rationalization. The more he \"reasons\", the worse becomes his situation fol he is a victim of delusion. An adept, on the contrary, has leamed to determine what mental images shall occupy iris field of attention. He selects then with care and sees to it that they ale true images. This enables him to imagine creatively and thr-rs he arrives at a true vision of man's place in the cosmic order. A1adept succeeds in controlling himself and his wolld because he has a rational grasp of the meaning of his personality. The glory round the Hanged Man's head refers to the illumination which comes as a resnlt of suspending the activity of personai consciousness. This glory is the sarne as the sun in Keys 0 and 6. The Halged Man's hail is white to show that he is one with the Hermit and the Emperor'. But his face is that of a youth, Thus he combines the two aspects which the Life-power presents to us. The Life-power is the Eternal Youth and it is also the Ancient of Days. One of its names is GOD. The other is MAN. He who knows this by direct experience is the wise man who says, \"I am doilg nothing,\" even in the midst of the most absorbing activities of terestrial existence.

More than this, you will begin to weave the strands of a consciousness which will eventually establish you in the understanding Key 12 s1'mboiizes' When the pictorial suggestions of this design begin to take effect, they will initiate a series of changes in your.mind and body. As a consequence of these changes, you will adopt the mental attitude of ufter dependence on the One Life. From this mental attitude health and well- being follow automatically. It serves to correct all negative states of mind. Thus it eradicates the ciuses of failure and fixes one fir'mly in the realization that the essence of hurnan personality is identical with the Limitless Life which creates and sustains the whole rmiverse' us080 l"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODIJCTION TO TA ROT. KEY 13. DEATH One main contrast distinguishes Ageless Wisdom from ordinary human philosophies. At best, the specuiations of ordinary human reason on the questions of survival and immortality give us no more than hopes based on analogy. At their worst, they lead to the hopeless conviction that this world and its conditions are allwe can ever know. Ageless Wisdom offers us a practical method for ovelcoming death. This is a method based on human experience. Human beings like ourselves have practiced it successfully in times past. Men and women now living have triumphed over death. (Scientific psychic research has, itl the opinion of most experts, established the case for survival beyond reasonable doubt. The following text, howevel, does not deal with the sulvival of consciousness and melnory after physical dissolution, but with the actual control by occult methods of such dissolution' Ed') Fcr. such persons the grave has no terols, death no sting of loss or separation. Theirs is not a hope. It is a cefiainty, and they say we may share their knowledge. In order to practice this method, we are not called upon to invite doubts of our sanity by declaring, 'lTh\"r\" is no death.\" On the contrary, to find the release we seek we must face resolutely the fact that bodies do die. Denial of fact is folly. Ignoring it is no use. Understanding what this hald fact leally rneans is needful and we never can undelstand anything we try to denY. Airplanes were not invented by denying the fact that objects heavier than air fall to the ground. Everything in a plane is heaviel than air, but we do not deny the force of gravity in 6rder to fly. We admit a[ the facts, and then we recognize, in certain combinations of other facts, a lneans to overcome the force of gravity. We face an undeniable fact when we com.e into the presence of death. Equally undeniable is the fact that a multitude of unimpeachable witnesses testiff to their knowledge that death may be overcome jgst as we overcoffie gravity-that is, by calling into operation cerlain other facts, certain other laws and fotces, which are always at hand ready for use' part of the life-equiprnent of every human being is an immortal sornething which was not botn with the body, something which will never die. More than tiris, the immortal something"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 7 within us is what brings about the dissolution of our physical bodies. Our essential immortal nature is the actual cause of the fact of physical dcath. When we face the fact of death, and learn its meaning, we shail find out how to overcome it, how to et'ase it completely fi'om our consciousness and our expedence. This is more than a promise of ccrtainty that we shall survive the death of the body. It is more than a mele hope of resunection. it is more than a change of consciousness. The knowledge of those who are consciously immorlal totally annuls death. Those who become perfect in this knowledge, here on earth, need have no experience of physical dissolution. They ate released from what seems to be the \"conrmon lot\". They are able to maintain the existence of their physical bodies in perfect healtli and vigor over a period of time limited only by their own deliberate choice. Key 13 declares tiris doctrine of Ageless Wisdorn symbolically. It does more. It conveys to subconsciousness, through the sense of sight, stimuli which will call forth fi'om out irurer mind tlr.e knowledge which will enable us to overcome death. The letter Nun J printed on this Key means, as a verb, \"to sprout, to grow\". As a noun, its meaning is \"fish\". This is also the proper name Nun given in the Old Testament to the father of Joshua. Norv, when the Old Testament says Joshua (liberation) was the son of Nun (fish), it is hinting that the liberating power of truth or reality is a consequence of the powcr of grolvtir represented by Nun. In the hulan body, this power of glowth is the cause of the multiplication of cells and of the development of structure. It is also the fturdarnental principle of leproduction. In Hebrew Wisdom, therefore, the letter Nur is associated with Scorpio, the sign of the zodiac which presides over reproduction. As the eighth sign of the zodiac, Scorpio has fundamental rulelship over the eiglrth house of the horoscope, the house of death and in-heritance. Our most precious heritage is the power which manifests itself in the fact of death. Fol . . . until such time as each individual will have progressed spiritually to that state where he will have leamed through direct perception the true nature of his life in its lelationship to the One Life, death is a necessity. Otherwise, like a defective phonograph record, the needle of his life would remain forever in the sa-rne groove. Endless repetition would replace progress. Most of us need to be forcibly removed by deatlr from the lut of our false perceptions . . . and again and again so removed until our spiritual knowledge and wisdom assllres oul'progress to perfection. The true nature of this death power is indicated by the number 13. This is the number in Hebrew, of two words. One means unity. The other means love. f'he One Power whence ali things proceed, the Love Power which is the cause of all attractions and affinities, is also the Death Power which brings about the dissolution of physical bodies. There are not two"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT antagonistic powers, one making for life, the other for death. There is only One Power having opposite forms of manifestation. At first glance, the central figure of Key 13 is the conventional replesentation of the \"Grim Reaper\". To the initiated eye, however, the skeleton is a reminder that the bony stntcture of the body is the foundation of all our rruscular activities without which no action would be possible. What is shown here, then, is a picture of the basis of all our personal activities. As a symbol, therefore, the skeleton stands for that which is the basis of all function, the foundation of all growth and development. This sornething is the One Power specialized in the reproductive functions of the body. It is tlie Seed-power. Hence a conventionalized picture of a seed is placed in the upper left-hand corner of the pictr,rre. The same power is represented by the skeleton. All growth and developrnent are based on endless permutations of fom. In the absolute sense there is no change for the No-Thing remains eternally Itself thloughout the whole series of appearances. Yet, in the relative sense) this pageant of transformation is actual, and it necessitates the dissolution of outworn fonns. Look closely and you will see that the skeleton is cut'iously distorted. There are two twists in the spinal column. One is just above the pelvis and selves to mark the location of the Mars center in the body. The other is at the neck where the Venus center has its place. Were this skeleton clothed with flesh, its body would be twisted in a way no contortionist could duplicate. This anatomical irnpossibility indicates the central secret of the thirleenth Key. We have to learn to give a certain twist to the energy rnanifested physically through the Mars center. This is the center in the nervous system which controls the reproductive activities of the body. We must learn to turn this energy in another direction, the reverse of what it usually takes. The Mars force is present in the body during one's entire lifetirne. Unless it be delibelately hrrned in the riglrt direction, we cannot overcome death' This new direction is given to the Mars force by rneans of the activity of its cornplement, the force whicir is specialized by the Venus center in the throat. Briefly, this is effected by a change in our mental imagery. Tl-re knowledge of this fact sheds a little rnore light on the meaning of Key 13. The impetus of this rising current of nerve force results in a change of cot-tsciousness, accompanied by the manifestation of occult powers which ale latent in most human oersonalities. us0801"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 7 Among these is the power of recollecting the experiences of human personality when it is functioning in the astral body and othel higher vehicles. Ail persons \"travel\" more or less in these higher vehicles when their physical bodies are asleep. We say \"nlore or less\", because such'Journeys\" are by no lneans of nightly occunence; and we put the words \"travel\" and 'Joumeys\" in quotation marks because there are good reasons for believing that what seems, during such experiences, to be movement from place to place, is actually simply an extension of consciousness. Just as soon as one begins to have conscious waking recollection of such expeliences, he is fieed from the delusion that his personality depends on having a physical body for its existence as a self-cottscious, thirdcing entity. The higher powers which unfold after this initial awakening ale represented in Key 13 by the hands and feet which the slceleton reaps. His scythe has a handle shaped like a letter \"T\", to show that this occult work calls into play the power coiled in the Saturn center at the base of the spine.
