Thus it is in contrast to Yod which represents the function of man's hand as the most delicate organ of touch. To grasp is to take possession. To grasp anything with the rnind is to become thoroughly conversant with it' What we leally comprehend is ours to control and employ' Thus the pair of opposites, Wealth and Poverty, coffespond truly to the meaning of Kaph. If our grasp of the meaning of events be weak, our control of things is uncertain and oul want of understanding rnanifests as poverty. A powerful grasp of the successive situations in our day to day expertence brilgs wealth. This wealth may be in dollars and cents, or it may take other forms. The money measure has its limitations; but it is safe to say that he who really comprehends the situation of man in this world will never suffer matelial want' In Tarot, the total sequence of events up to any given moment is lepresented by l(ey 0. And, as we iook at the suriace of tire world, what it amounts to, if we judge by appearances only, is \"a tale told by an idiot, signiffing nothing\". yet if we observe (Key 1), remember (I{ey 2), imagine hidden lelationships (Key 3), and reason truly (I(ey 4), we shall comprehend. Our comprehension is symbolized in Tarot by Key 10 and its numbel is the sum of the nunbers from 0 to 4. Thus the Wheel of Fortune represents tlie full development of the meanings of the Emperor, since 10 is the extension of Scientific comprehension takes facts like the recunence of the seasons, tl're regularity of astronomical phenomena, and similar repetitive activities in man's environment, and works out from observatiol of these facts, from records of theil occlln'ence, and from deductions concerning the relationships existing among them, vatious systems in which the idea of rotation, cycles, ol the,.\"urr.,r., ofevents in regular, and therefore predictable, order is funclamental. This is what is behind the symbolisrn of l(ey 10."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO T;IROT': 6 At the outer corners of the picture are the four rnystic animals mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel and appearing again in the Apocalypse. The bull stands for Taulus and for the element of earth. The lion stands for Leo and for tire element of fire. The eagle is connected with Scorpio and the element of water. The man is associated with Aquarius and the element of air. Thus the animals correspond to the four implements on the Magician's table, which stand for fire (wand), water (cup), air (sword) and earth (coin or pentacle). Occult tradition associates these fout elements with the Divine Name, Jehovah, which is wlitten in Hebrew letters round the outer circle of the wheel. The outer circle contains the Roman chalacters spelling the word ROTA. From these four letters the arlificial word TAROT is formed by beginning at the top of the wheel, and leading the letters clockwise round it beginning and ending with T. Different affangements of the same letters also form the name ATOR. Ator was an ancient Latin rendering of the name of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, personi$ing Nature, and corresponding more or less to Venus, pictured in Talot as the Empress. This will serve to remind you that all we are able to comprehend consists of aotivities which belong to the subconscious field of the Life-power's manifestation. \"Nature\" is just a generalization from our experience of the different fields included in the ancient classification of the four elements. Whatever is at wor-k in these fields is basically the operation of subconscious powers. This, indeed, is why we controi whatever we can comprehend. Withil the onter cilcle showing the four liebrew and the four Latin lettels is an eight-armed cross. Four arms point to the Hebrew, and four to the Latin letters. The arms of the cross pointing to the Latin letters bear four symbols. These are derived frorn alchemy. Beneath the letter T is the alchemical syrnbol for Mercury' Beside the letter A is the alchemical symbol for Sulphur. The syrnbol beside the letter O stands for Salt. That above the letter R is used by astrologers for the Sign Aquarius, represented in the upper lefthand comer of Key 10 by the head of a man. It is also an alchemical symbol for dissolution and for the essential secret of the Gleat Work' Man, by reason of his self-consciousness, is able to apply the \"universal soivent\", or alchemical Mercury, to the various appearances constituting his envilorunent. By this means he discovers their real, as distinguished from their apparent, natttre. Thus man is able to reduce every form reported by his senses to its primal substance and whenever he does so, he fi1ds that substance to be the lirnitless Life-power symbolized in Tarot by thq Fool' Then, by exercising his power of mental vision in creative imagination, man is able to fix this prirnal substance into new shapes and fonns. He may do this by the indirect method of inveltion using machines or other appliances constructed in accordance with his scientific comprehension. Or he may work directly, by mental means only, upon the plimal substance a1d io bring forlh forrns corresponding to his images. They who are able to do this constitute the inner circle of adepts.

It represents the vibrating folce associated with the letter Teth and Key 8, involving itself in the conditions of name and form which constitute man's environment. On the other side ascends a figule having a human body and a jackal's head. This is the Egyptian god Hermanubis, the guide of the soul in its joumey thlough the underworld, and also closely related to the valious ideas comrected with Melcury and tire Magician. His eye is alongside the lettel A whiclr. is the Rornan equivalent of Aleph. The intellectual consciouslless of the mole advanced human being sees, more or less cleally, what is pictuled in Tarot by the Fool (Aleph); but few persons know the indwelling Spirit as a direct personal experience. Yet some have intuitive perception of this Spirit, and thus the ears of Hermanubis ale above the letter A in the segment of the wheel containing the letter Yod. Yod is the letter of the Hermit and what is meant by this detail of the syrnbolism is that though the intellectual consciousness may not experience superconsciousness directly, it rnay receive intirnations concerning that higher order of knowing tluough the channel of interior healing. At the top of the wheel sits a sphinx, like one of those crouching in front of the car in Key 7. Under this cleature, which is a synthesis of male and female, hurnan and animal, stands the letter T, conesponding to the final letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Tav 11, and to Key 21 of Tarot. In the table given in HIGHLIGHTS, you will see that Tav represents the Administrative Intelligence. Thus th.e sphinx, by its relation to this letter, and to the Mercury symbol under the T, represents completion of the Great Work. To finish the Great Work is to develop the metaphysical senses which conespond to the physical serlses. It is to have direct experience of identity with the One Self. We must always remember that this experience is not to be confused with theoretical knowledge about this identity, nor with philosophical speculations and religious cleeds. The average human being does not even know about this identity. He simply believes or disbelieves, without knowing the Self directly. The exceptional human being does know, and because he knows, shares consciously in the adrninistration of tl,e laws of nature. His personal activities are al all f.imes in harmony with the way things really ate. He is adjusted to the cosmic rhythm. Thus whatever he does works out as plarured and he is free from the ups and downs of fortune. Use this Tarot Key to remind you that the motion of the heavenly bodies veils a Living Organism. In it you live and move and have your being. Your consciousness is not separate from the Intelligence which swings the stars tluough the cosmos. As an aspect of the One Life, your irnmediate environment becomes enriched as you grasp the significance of this relationship.

JUSTICE Lamed 9, the Hebrew equivalent of English \"L\", means \"ox- goad\". In contrast to Kaph, the hand u'hich grasps, the goad is a tool, or thing grasped. Spelt in the sarne way, but with a sliglrt change of pronr.urciation, the name of this letter, lDb, is a verb, meaning \"to teach\", and thus the ideas lepresented by our noun education are related to Lamed. An ox-goad is used to pride oxen and to keep them on the road chosen by the driver. Hence ideas of control and direction ale connected with this letter. Up to this point in our study of Tarot we have come upon a pair', or yoke, of oxen. The fir'st is Aleph, corresponding to the Irool, since the letter-name Aleph means ox or bull. The second is Vav, corresponding to the Hierophant, because Vav is the leiter of the sign Taurus, the Bull. Furthermore, the idea of yoking is conlected u'ith the meaninss of the letter Vav. Hence the idea of education implied by Lamed has to do with the management of this pair of oxen - the superconsciousness fypified by the Fool, and the intuitive knowledge of leality syrnbolized by the Hierophant. To be educated is not to be possessed of an acculllulation of facts gatheled from without. It is to be able to apply to the conduct of life the inspiration which comes to us fi'om above (Fool), and from within (Hierophant). Lamed is the second of tluee I-Iebrew letters formed like a serpent. Its shape is like that of a snake, uncoiled, the head at the left side of the lettel, the body represcnted by tlie l-rorizontal line and the tail indicatcd by the line dlopping fi'om the horizontal line at the right side of the letter. It symbolizes the serpent power, coiled and quiescent in the I{ebrew character for Tetir ll, now extended and active. Thrrs Fabre d'Olivet, in THE FIEBREW'|ONGUE RESTORED, page 377, says of the letter Lamed: us080 I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: \"This character as consonant, belongs to the lingual sound. As symbolic image it replesents the arm of man, the wing of a bird, that which extends, raises and unfolds itself. As grarnmatical sign, it is expansive movement and is applied to all ideas of extension, elevation, occupation, possession, It is, in Hebrew, the directive adicle, as I have explained in my Grammar, expressing in nouns or actions, a lnovement of union, dependence, possession ol coincidence.\" Thus when TI-IE BOOI( OF FORMATION assigns action or work to Lamed it agrees with the ftindamental meaning of the lettei'itself. This idea of action adds another thought to our conception of education. He who is truly educated is more than a possessor of information whether gathered from without ol from within. He is a person having practical skill. He has drawn forlh his powers and has developed ability to apply them to the management and direction of affairs. To what end? The number 1 1 gives an answer. It is a pair of 1s. What is shown in Tarot by I(ey 1, the Magician, is unfolded, augmented, extended by doubling, and since the idea of donbling is represented by 2, and by the High Priestess, the Tarot meaning of 11 has to do with the recording and development accornplished by means of the activities represented by the High Pliestess, and the result is balance. Observation and memoly are the fundamentals of education. Practical skill is the result of training which establishes habits, and these habits are not fully established until our bodies, by the operation ofsubconsciousness, have been changed. The body and brain of a pianist, for example, are different from those of one who cannot play. A pianist's hands have a characteristic shape, easily recognized. Whatever skill you may have has left perceptible traces on the structure of your physical mechanism. Thus we have said befole that the difference between an adept and an average iruman being is a difference in physiology. An adept is one who has practical knowledge and makes continual use of everything he knows. Practical knowledge, moreover, enables one to make adjustments. Hence the name of Key 11 is Justice. Abstract justice is law, and while it is true that human laws are often poor approximations to justice, nevertheless the intent of arry code of laws is always toward the establistunent of a working arrangement which shall bling the lives of the community govemed by that code into harmony with one another and into a position whele good shall result frorn their practical management of human affairs. Among the zodiacal signs, Libla is attributed to Lamed. It is the only one of the signs which is symbolized by an inanimate object, for its emblem is a pair of scales. The ruler of Libla is Venus and the sitting figure shown in Key 1i therefore wears a crowll and has yellow hair', like the Tarot symbol of Venus, the Empress. She represents creative USOBO]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO TAROT: 6 imagination in its relation to work. All good work must be planned and planning lequires the ,rr\" of t6. subconscious power to form clear mental irnages of intended actions. Such clear images are effective when they agree with the actual facts of the situation. Whatever their details, their fi'ameworli must be true to fact, Tliis framework is like the bones in a body, and accolding to astrology, the planet Satutn, exalted in Libra, rules the bones. Hence one prominent featule of Key 11 is a T-cross which ornaments the dress of the woman. In colored versions of Tarot, this ornament is deep indigo, the tint which, in oul color scale, represents the pianet Satum. The difference between creative imagination and mere fancy is that the former has a solid foundation in fact. Arabian story-tellels used fancy to weave their magic carpet. The Wrights dealt with hard facts and developed the airplane. To make adjustments which will change a problem into an achievement, two things are necessary. We must weigh and measure the facts colrectly. Without accurate measurements, without conect standards, we are sure to fail. This is what is at the bottom of most of our troubles. We go by \"rule of thumb\". We are content with guesses and with approximations. So we blulder along like oxen without drivers, and our hit-and-miss procedure defeats our efforls. Yet the facts are 1ot all. There must be action in halmony with our knowledge of the actual situation. Moreover, this action must be aimed at elirninating whatever restricts our fieedom' Helce the scales of Justice are balanced by her sword, symbol of terror to evil-doers. Metaphorically, an evil-doer is any activity which restricts freedom and interferes with the harmonious adjustment of our lives. Whatever leads away fiom the path of liberation, whatever deflects the auow of purpose frorn the mark at which it is aimed, must be elinilated. You will notice that this detail of Key l1 is also a feature of Key 10 where the sphinx holds a sword. Remember also that Zain,the swotd, is the letter symbolized by the iou.rr, a picture of two persons standing side by side like the two 1s in the number 1 1' practical skill in adjusting one's life is an application of the power of discriminatiou pictured in Key 6; and since 1 1 is the sum of 5 and 6, we may say also that practical skill is discrimination combined with intuition. It is not surprising, therefore, that we find many instances of sudden flashes of intuitive perception among workers in scientific research' Such persons seek patiently for facts, and their quest fol truth requires them to develop great iechnical shill in the manipulation of delicate instntments requiring fine adjustments' Key 11 is the complement of Key 10, just as Key I is the complement of Key 0- The Wheel of Fortune is tlr.e Tarot symbol for cosmic law. Justice is the symbol for the application of that law throggh human action. Hence the central figure of Key 11 is a seated woman.

Thus Key 11 is also connected with the idea of faith. Faith, \"the substance of things hoped fol, and the evidence of things unseen\", is the basis of right action. True faith is the habitual (therefore subconscious) conviction that nothing whatever in the cosmic order is inirnical to rnan. Whatever is, is for our good; and when we have the wit to discover what is behind the appearances surrounding us, and the courage and skill to do what we know, we find that nothing in the universe is against us. Appearances to the contrary are due to our ignorance. When we rneasure facts correctly, especially the facts about human nature, we shall be able to establish justice in our lives and in our surroundings. us0801"}]
