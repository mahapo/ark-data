[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC D(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 31 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures I consider myself very well equipped to speak on the subject of wealth and poverty; an expert, in fact. Do you know why? Because I have wept with hunger! Such a person, I think, has the authority to speak; I have been there and I know. Why did I weep with hunger? One might say, \"I wept with hunger because I did not have anything to eat!\" This is obvious, but if we want to \"metafoozle,\" we might say, \"I went through hunger because I did not have a prosperity consciousness.\" Actually, as I recall it, I did not have either a prosperity consciousness or a depression consciousness. Such ideas are a lot of nonsense. If you have a prosperity consciousness, as they say, you are still on the wheel of opposites, and you swing (whether from incarnation to incarnation or within one incarnation) from one pole to the other. You must go beyond that materialistic idea. Jesus' statement, \"Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven\" has much to do with the spirit of this key, though it seems to show you a mechanistic aspect of life and evolution. The key tells you clearly, by the way the symbols are presented, that it is not mechanistic, We need to acquire a truly perceptive spirit to develop a real grasp of the essence of riches. Everyone of us, curiously enough, is rich! We are wealthy beyond description, even if we have no job and are hungry or have no place to sleep. We are wealthy because we have consciousness which is continually creating out of the substance of life and the universe all things that are to be. What we are now is the essence of all the things we have been; this does not mean that we have been very bad or very good. We must learn how to interpret the whole picture. A person suffering poverty can have a fine karma but be materially poor because he has reached a point of growth in which he is being prepared to be a more intensive servant for life in the evolution of humanity, to help wash out poverty. It takes many, many people to do this. It takes many to be channels for the One Life for every step in evolution, thousands and thousands. Those of us who study together in our lessons are given the opportunity and privilege of being conscious channels for the evolutionary processes of humanity rather than slaves of a cycle whirling us until we are dizzy. Most of us are dizzy, but we need not be since we know now how to work properly. Experiencing poverty is something I am more grateful for than I can tell you. It gave me the opportunity to know, to feel, to do, to yearn towards others in a way I could never have otherwise. My weeping with hunger was not under very easy circumstancesl I was pregnant, which is the worst time to weep from hunger, believe me! I was desperate enough to hunt in a grove for oranges. They were all green and then I wept because I could not steal any. It was really a wonderful experience in retrospect. Although I went through this period of what the world would call extreme poverty, most of the time I was not aware of the fact that I was poor except for the short period when I wept when carrying a child. It never occurred to me to entertain the idea, \"I have not money to do this or that.\" It never occurred to me because I had a roof over my head; I had clothes, and after a while I had food although there was a period during which I had to be careful with it. The dog had to have his sharel my child had to have her sharel and I had a pair of birds which I could not let starve. The point is that it never occurred to me that I was living in a situation that was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 31 terrible or poor. Friends came to see me, and I was proud to have them come to my home, and they enjoyed coming. This was a test of poverty that I had to go through as one of many preparations for the task of heading B.O.T.A. You have to know about human needs and lacks from the heart in order to serve as a true channel for aspirants. There is such an intensification of enerS/ involved in the process of awakening the consciousness, of achieving the higher levels, that you have first to go through these tests, and sometimes the way to pass the tests is not to be aware that you are having them. When I came to Dr. Case I had no feeling of the need for security that most people have. Some said I was not practical. When we had a problem of seeing that paper and supplies were available to keep the lessons going to members of B.O.TA., I took every cent we had from the bank; I worked without any salary. This period could be considered very trying, but Dr. Case and I were not worried, and in time the situation improved. I felt so wealthy in having the ability and the privilege to serve that I refused a position offering $10,000 a year when it was offered, A group of stock brokers were having much trouble over their electronic machine operators and were so desperate for lack of qualified personnel that they asked me to work for them, to head a training program for their employees. They offered to start me at $10,000 a year, and that was in 1946 when the dollar bought much more than it does today. I was not impressed. I had far greater riches! What did I need all that money for? Did I need tc have rnoney to buy rny own home? B.O.T.A. ovmed a pastorate hoo.-rse, in which we worked, and so I had a roof over my head. When I died, what difference would it make? It is a modest little house but I love it; isn't that enough? I like to work in slacks and sweaters because they are so comfortable, so clothes are a very small item. What was the point in becoming a commercial success, especially when I was in such rich circumstances? I had everything I needed, and the fact that my needs were modest meant only that I had fewer things to worry about. I share this with you to show you the spirit of riches which we all need to develop, whatever our circumstances happen to be, That situation was one of the tests. The story in the Bible of Jesus being taken up to the mountain top and tempted by the devil, offered riches and power, takes place in all of us. This is the story of our evolution; we all pass through various tests, some of which we fail and have to take over again, and some we pass. We are often not even aware that we are passing them. That is the highest kind of passing, as we realize later when we look back. This offer of financial success was a test but no test to me, for I found it amusing. We must begin to look at wealth and poverty in a different manner. We must begin to understand a little more of the whole feeling and value of Key 10. We cannot eliminate any stage of our growth, but it can be hastened and the work of B.O.TA. is aimed at hastening our progress so that our cycles flow with greater and greater rapidity. That is why so many find that when they truly aspire many things happen to them that they had not anticipated. It is not that they have failed; it is rather that the whole evolutionary process is accelerated for them in order to help them develop more rapidly. It is a speeding up of the wheels, the inspirations, the insights, the growth."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 31 We all pass through these tests. I am sure that you have passed many tests and never realized it. One can usually tell whether or not the aspirant has passed tests by the quality of his emotions, because the evolved soul sees the riches inherent in the abilities and capacities to feel, to love, to express, to pour from within out. Real poverty is the inability to feel, to love, to express, to pour from within out. We must gain a deeper insight into the essential nature of wealth and povert5r. When, therefore, we speak of wealth and povert5r, keep in mind that we are not speaking in terms of dollars. Every aspirant who is in situations, no matter how modest, in which he or she has the ability to live as a human being and has the necessities of food, clothes and shelter, is rich. If that person wants more) he is putting materialistic emphasis on his needs and will have to repeat the cycle in order to learn what riches really are. When you begin to feel rich, you also begin to have cherished possessions come your way unexpectedly. I have a passion for music. It is a background to the work I do. It is as essential to me as air, as food; indeed, I would rather miss meals than music. This is how much it means to me in terms of inner sustenance. I thought I was very rich when I managed to obtain a very small radio, one that others might consider unsatisfactory. I did not consider it unsatisfactory at all. When I turned it to a music station and the background was filled with static, I ignored the static, listened to the notes of beauty and went about my work. I thought I was very fortunate to play music at will and have it as a background to my work. One day, the Grand Prolocutor of Builders of the Adytum, Dr. Case, insisted that tr should have a more modern musical system. He said that anyone who loved music as I did deserved a high fidelity set. It never occuned to me that I would enjoy a high flrdelity set more than my little radio because I felt I enjoyed it to the utmost. It seemed a waste of money to buy a high fidelity set because I object to any funds being spent on something unnecessary when those funds might help one aspirant along the way, might bring a lesson to him. Before I knew what was happening, I was the owner of a magnificent high fidelitSr system, as a gift partly from him and partly from another. But, I must confess, I do not really get any greater joy from the high fidelity than I did from the radio because my consciousness blocked out the static from the radio and I was determined to love the music I had. This is riches. This is a material luxury that came to me, but I was unwilling to have it at the expense of sorrow for another person. I am not against luxury, but if it is not there I am not aware of it. That is the important point and this perhaps is the thing we have to learn. When the consciousness is busy being grateful and pouring out love and gratitude for what one has, then the other things come too, like rains to the thirsty earth. This is the secret of wealth and poverty, not the frantic scramble for money to spend. Elementary metaphysics does not give the principle correctly, although it is a good school for people to pass through as it helps to give them the first training of requirements in occult work. In our course (Seven Steps in Practical Occultism), we give an aspect of this, but we condense in seven lessons what some people spend twenty years learning in elementary metaphysics. You do have to start with the elementary principles, but you must learn to understand their higher meanings."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 31 Riches are bound up with what you feel regarding your own being, your own soul, your own life! These are the true riches, and no one is more poverty stricken than he who has put up a wall of protection in order not to be hurt by another or cheated by another or betrayed by another. No one is more poverty stricken than he, because he locks atvay life to preserve himself from hurt. He buries his talents in the ground. You must be willing to iisk hurt in order to have a channel of riches flowing in return on the spiral cycle. This is the secret of riches! You have to be willing to see the sorrow, the disappointments and know they have their value. This is only part of learning how to discriminate, a necessary experience of learning, not to use disappointment to cut off your free flowing motion towards life and God. Some say, \"I aspire to the love of God; this is what I want.\" They will never attain the love of God so long as they anxiously protect their little personal selves from being hurt in personal relationships. If you cannot love a person, many persons, you are never going to love God; you only delude yourself that you do. To be willing to love and learn where you love unwisely, this, too, is riches! Not that you should wear your heart on your sleeve. That is foolish. Conversely, many people are frozen by hurts. One of the greatest problems in life is the frozen emotional life. It is undue protectiveness which makes the whole wheel sluggish in developing riches. When you wake up in the morning,Io.il should be pouring from your inner essence, from the stream of your life--gratitude for life itself. Whatever misfortune is yours, there is still much to be grateful for. Be grateful that you can see colorl that you can feel the bteeze on your skin; that you can wake up knowing there is a shelter over your head; that there is a cup of coffee or tea to drink; a breakfast to eat. Be grateful that you are able to taste, to be, to have the riches of this livingness. Be grateful that you can walk, that you can meet a human being and look into his face, his eyes. Be grateful for your pets, that there is a pet to touch, to exalt over, to chuckle about. Be grateful that you can listen to the song of the birds or an orchestral spnphony delivered by man and inspired by God. Are these not riches? Be grateful that you can walk in the light of the sun and under the glory and radiance of the stars. Not to be grateful for all this is povert;r, indeed! This is the problem in human consciousness, and this is what keeps the human being in the same cycle, swinging from riches to povert5r and back again, until he manages to feel rich for the livingness, for the consciousness, for the ability to be conscious, to be aware. And to the degree that you learn that you are wealthy though you may not have a million dollars. The secret is in learning how to let glatitude flow for the things we do not ordinarily pay attention to. Such gratitude reciprocates, and once you achieve this interflowing you no longer have to worry about food, clothing and shelter--and you can even acquire a high fidelity system to replace a little scratchy radio. That is the way it works. In other words, we experience what we are. When we are rich in our souls, we begin to experience whatever security we need. Our Father-Mother will not let us starve to death, though sometimes it might seem so, or let us struggle too long in the snow and cold. We have so much to sing a song about! This attitude will solve our financial problems as well as problems of emptiness and loneliness. This is the key that opens the door to the riches of consciousness. When you learn to have eyes to see, you grasp the principle."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 31 TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 10, THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE The technique for using Key 1-0 to develop extrasensory perception and power is as follows: The color assigned to Key 10 is violet. Permeate yourself in living liquid violet light. In imagination put the four signs of the zodiac in the appropriate corners of this key. Think of yourself as backing into this key, being sure to remember those four living creatures, because this connects you with the firmament, the signs of the zodiac, the cosmic enerry that flows into the cycles and within the cycles. Picture the bottom edge of the wheel as coming to about your solar plexus, for this key is attributed to the planet Jupiter, the holy inner planet of the chakras assigned to the nerves at the solar plexus. Picture the center of the wheel as coming to the upper part of the heart center, near the throat. It takes in, because of its radiations, the heart and throat centers together. We want a balanced stimulus between these two. See that the top of the wheel comes three or four inches above your head. Whenever you need to acquire a better comprehension of any situation or problem, or whenever you need help in feeling secure, use this key. Mentally imagine yourself as rising up like a straight line. The bottom of the wheel is at your solar plexus and the top about four inches above your head. Think of passing through the wheel, the wheel being a sphere instead of a flat surface. That is what it is really meant to be, a liquid sphere, not a structure of physical matter, for it is mental substance. Image yourself as levitating to the center of the wheel, until you are standing on top of it, right in front of the sphinx. Your Higher Consciousness is at your back; it is the part of you that has attained, that knows who and what you really are. This is the idea to give yourself. AFFIRIvIATION: \"There may be wheels within wheels, from the most minute to the most expansive, but I am eternal consciousness and in control of my destiny, through being an aspect and expression of the One Life. I, therefore, choose, in this instance, to feel the security of my relationship to the universe, and I call upon my Higher Self to give me what comprehension I require for this period or cycle.\""}]
