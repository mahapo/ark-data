[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERJC D(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWER,S LESSON 23 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures When we eat our hearts out for something we think we must have at once, we add insult to injury; we cause more and more damage to our inner psyche by ?n intense determination that we must demonstrate, that tomonow is too late, etc. In all of our work we have eternity at our disposal; although this may evoke the response of the man in prison whom a very \"spiritual soul\" came to visit, saying, \"Now, dear man, you must remember that stone walls do not a prison make or iron bars a cage.\" The prisoner replied, \"No sir, but a twenty-year stretch sure do seem like it.\" This is true, but the reason for it is that our conseiousness is focused on the vital importance of what appears to be going on \"out there,\" and the truth is, it is not going on \"out there,\" it is going on within our own consciousness. In the final analysis, what does a lifetime really matter? Whether you are a doctor or a lawyer or a housekeeper, what does it really matter in the long run? The life between incarnations is a bare split second to the Higher Self. It is discrimination in values that determines the success' the fullness of life. This does not mean that we do not deserve to have the good things of this world, but our values are what determine whether or not the things of this world are good. The little house I live in; you can see daylight through some of the cracks, but it is a beautiful place because love lives there. I have loved the walls, and since everything loves to be loved the walls have loved me back, at least that is how I experience it. Discrimination as to valtr-es is at the heart of being able to live a rich life. Simply having things does not make anybody happy, as we all know. The very wealthy are among the most unhappy. Many people think that they would like the opportunity of being unhappy and wealthy, but those who have known this unhappiness know better. The very wealthy can never be sure whether they are loved or being exploited. The_ famous are never sure wirether they are loved or are being sought after for the prestige conferred. They lead a very insecure life. Discrimination in values does not take away the possibility and the potential of having a comfortable or even a luxurious life, but the minute that that luxury becomes imporlant to us, we are in trouble hfcause we are remaining in the whirl of opposites. If something is so important that you fear its loss, you will lose it. If not in this incarnation, then in th1 next one. You will swing between the opposing poles. No one, therefore, really enjoys good things until he is free of his dependency upon them. It is not that we are \"gainrt lrr\"uries; I love being able to listen to good music, to be able to put on fine clothes. There is nothing wrong with this, but we have to know how to discriminate in terms of values, of what these things are really worth. If we are at war with ourselves, as most of us are, we are inevitably going to be at war in our relationships with others, even though we may not recognize this consciously. Curiously enough, people often think that discrimination is a faculty of the subconscious mind. Discrimination is really intuitive, and this was brought home to me quite clearly recently, A friend in conversation mentioned to me the importance of freedom to her, saying, \"I can't be hemmed in.\" There was, I thought, too much emotion in her remark. Ordinarily one should not call out what one observes in others. It is rarely wise to discuss what you see because most people are not ready for such analysis, but it is very"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORYPOWERS: 23 important to train yourself to see. Here and there are a few relationships in which you can be open and frank, where there are good aspirations and a sincere drive to achieve the Higher. Because this was true of this person, I said when I saw her next, \"I detected a certain amount of emotion in your statement that you needed to be free and not hemmed in. I should say that there is a deep-rooted emotional problem related to that'\" She said, \"You have put your finger on something very important. But it wasn't the emotion in the voice, although that might have triggered it, it was your intuition that put your finger on it.\" That one little remark made me go back and analyze many things. I usually meditate on a key for several hours before lecturing on it or writing about it; that is the only preparation necessary. When I was preparing to discuss this particular Tarot Key 6, I seemed to realize that discrimination is the result of paying acute attention to what is going on here and now. A twitch of the eyebrow, a slight rise in the tone, an emotional response, are little things and we often miss them. Consequently our intuition cannot give us the proper evaluation because we are not looking. Only after we have used all of our faculties to give the proper images and information to the subconscious, which then submits them to the superconscious, do we have the condition in which real intuition can give us the correct interpretations. That is discrimination! Discrimination is really an intuitive faculty, a vital one, which involves all of the other faculties, both the inner and the outer senses. It depends on the ability to pay attention' In occult studies you have learned to recognize that sometimes you can cure an illness on the inside by making yourself change your attitude on the outside. You can often work on it from one pole as well as from the other, be+ause as you aet so you finally become. My daughter taught me that lesson when she was quite a youngster. We had discussed how we act towards others and its relation to God. I had complained to her about a mutual acquaintance, saying, \"That person is really just putting on an act of love, not really loving.\" My daughter replied, \"Well, mother, aren'tyou the one who told me that that which we act out long enough, we finally become? Well, that person is in the act of becoming loving!\" And I thought, \"Out of the mouths of babes!\" I bring this up because very often, if we realize we have certain problems inside and make up our minds to act deliberatelyjust in reverse of the problem, the problem is solved. In our esoteric astrologr class we made a game of it. At the end of the course we had a party. All of our members came dressed to represent their idea of the opposite of the worst quality they thought they had in terms of their own personality. They acted out the positive side of what they considered their chief negative, and it had a remarkable effect. This is a technique which can be practiced anywhere, at any time. Suppose you feel you are shy. What makes you shy? Your personality is a picture (for \"persona\" means a mask), God loves to dress up, just as children love to dress up and play roles. You must think of your personality in terms of the actor, and learn how to b\".o*. an excellent actor, always looking to the director, the Angel. We make our mistakes when we try to be our own directors instead of letting the Higher Self direct us. So, picture howyou would act if you were not shy and act the role to someone; if possible, to several people."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER.S: 23 3 At our first costume party, we had one of the shyest little ladies who had been coming to our classes for almost two years and had never been heard to open her mouth. To this special parf, which was really a laboratory exercise for spiritual development, she came dressed as a society lady in satins and rhinestones. She wore all of those things that would indicate that she was a leader of fashion. She fluttered all over the room saying, \"How are you, my dear? My name is so-and-so.\" She effused all over everyone' utterly delightfully! After that she lost every bit of sh5rness, at least with our group. The ice was broken and it gradually changed her in other ways too. You do not have to go to a special party to utilize this technique; think what it would be like not to be shy and act in that manner. If you are shy, it is only because you are suf- fering from an inferiority complex; you are afraid someone will reject you, and none of us want to be rejected. Nevertheless, remember that other people are just as frustrated as you and that they have needs just as great as yours; that everyone needs to feel that someone is interested in them. Act out the opposite of shyness. You need not effuse and flutter; that was a deliberate exaggeration at the party. But remember that whatever your basic problem may be emotionally, if you will try to act out the opposite part with at least one person as often as you can (and then with others), you will transmute that element of your personality. Furthermore it will help you to become more discriminating in regard to the problems of others. All of us, without exception, have been betrayed. We have all been the victims of treachery at some time or other; as'lovers, in business. in childhood, Hardly anyone can go through life without having some such experience. When we are the victims of treachery, we feel disquieted and hurt. We think, \"Why should this have happened to me? I am loyal, I am not a betrayer.\" This is a mistaken attitude, a lack of discrimination. The principle works differently. You do not have to be a betrayer at heart; you could be the most loyal of human beings and still attract betrayal after betrayal, because of your subconscious patterns of fear and distrust towards others. So do not be too ready to condemn others; postpone early evaluations; don'tjust jump to conclusions. Don't think that because you see a certain quality or attitude expressing towards you from another that it means you have this same quality. I know a man who suffered nothing but betrayal and treachery in business, first from one person then from another, repeatedly through his lifetime. And yet, he is one of the most loyal friends that God ever created. If you are his friend, you have a rare joy. Now, he has been betrayed continually. Why? He grew up with a total sense of inferiority which expressed itself in bragging. He does not rcalize this. He thought, on the contrary, that he had deep humility. Yet, he was forever bragging about all he had accomplished. He was forever trying to prove that he was worth looking up to, worth liking; and this was not necessary because he was worth liking; he had no need to prove it. He was a wonderful soul. But he had a total sense of insecurity and emotional fear. He was utterly dependent on his mother emotionally and financially, even after he married. When things went wrong and he attempted to correct them, he always seemed to attract to himself situations in which whatever he did he ended up on the outside. All his life he felt like an outsider. Even as a child he felt an outsider. So, feeling like an outsider, he found himself outside."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPER,SENSORY POWER'S: 23 He could have tried mental methods to project desirable situations from now until doomsday without effect; he had to change his conscious emotional response to life' Betrayals inevitably arise if you are full of fear and insecurity, for you are projecting them to other people, and the result is that you find yourself outside. That is one of the many reasons wny it is most important to find our securit5r in the Higher Self' the Angel, the Juperconscious! So long as we look for our securitSi on the outside, to business associites, family, and at ttre same time have feelings of inferiority and fear, for that long shall we continue to project situations which no amount of mental work or imaging will change until we change our own responses. For this reason we must develop enough discrimination to be able to see what causes the problems in our lives. Problems frustrate and hinder because of the patterns ingrained in your subconscious; yet, as we have shown, the patterns do not make you evil. Be careful to learn how to use waichful attentiveness. As you were told to \"listen\" with Key 5, to the Higher Self, the best way to develop discrimination is to give whomever or whatever you are with your total attention. Life is much richer that way. The only value in life is found in \"relationships! You cannot have the proper relationships until you have developed the capacity to give the fullness of yourself to each relationship and receive the full relationship in'return. You will always choose the wrong people for relationships until you are able to choose people who have the capacity to fulfill your real needs. To a friend of mine who had great intuitive perception but who was desperately in need of help, had cortle a woftrm ffith.€U o+thesbilities *hat ray friend ns€d€d. F{e wes - - very gratefut to take this person as his secretary and assistant. But his helper had a way of r\"Vt\"g often and with great emotion, \"Oh, no title for mel I don't want to be in the limelilht. Just let me work quietly in the back; no title,\" He realized this woman needed titles ind prestige more than any other person he had ever known. Remember, \"Methinks the lady doth protest too much.\" Watch attentively to gain the information that is given your inner self. Then it, in turn, is able to return the proper interpretation. My friend saw that his assistant was sick with yearning for power and position. Her emotional denials of it, without reason or provJcation, made-that all too clear. He decided to try an experiment to give this person po*.r and prestige. Perhaps this would satisfy her and he would have the advantage of all irer other aliliti\"s. It did not work, but it taught him a great deal. When a person has a craving for power, he cannot be fulfilled if there is anyone superior to him. And his helper slandered him behind his back because this was her nature. Most of us notice things about people and their actions without really taking them into consciousness. We pay no attention, and this does not give our inner selves sufficient information to produc. [hat perception that becomes true discrimination. That is why we need to give people and things our total attention. Just as we instructed you in the last lesson to listen with all of your attention when you rneditate to hear the Inner Voice, so too, when you are with anyone, you should be listening, you should be looking; all of your facultLs should be aware, gathering in the data. In that way you will come to know people better, and you will come to know yourself better, because at the same time that you are"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 23 watching your reactions to the data, you are also watching and evaluating yourself, and you will learn how to see wisely, You do not judge; you do not condemn. Anything that you condemn, you will become. Things will push you into a situation in which you will find yourself being and doing the things you condemn. Remember the old American Indian adage, \"Judge no man until thou hast walked in his moccasins for three moons.\" If you were in anyone else's shoes, you would do exactly as he is doing, under his patterns and conditions. But you need to know what he does and why he does it, because that is what we are here for, to develop the intensity of our consciousness, for that is part of power. Supersensory powers are not usable without discrimination! All of the psychic faculties will delude you without discrimination. Every psychic expeyience you have comes through subconsciousness, which colors all that comes through. Only as we transmute our subconsciousness and make it a clear, reflective mirror for the Higher Self can we trust our psychic faculties. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 6, THE LOVER,S The color of this path on the Tree of Life is orange, so image yourself as filled with orange throughout your body. Picture yourself as being in an oval of vivid, pulsating, vibrating orange, permeating your body and your aura. Picture the two figures in this key, Adam and Eve, male and female, as being at the same level as your body. Together they make your personality. Picture the Angel and the sun as being above them and you, in the same position as on the key. Carefully note the colors of the key so that you ean visualize it in color. Having formed this image, this is what you should do: Have the male figure, self-consciousness, talk to the female figure, subconsciousness, in these terms but in your own words: \"Subconsciousness, I hereby clear you from all misinterpretations of my past experiences. I request that you reach up to superconsciousness to receive the proper interpretations, which you will then reflect to me as I need them. I release you from all erroneous emotional responses to my experiences. In the future, should I attempt to give you further misinterpretations, you will refuse to accept them, and instead reach up to the Higher Self, reflecting back to me that which I need to know and understand.\" Say that in essence. Now picture subconsciousness nodding her head, \"Yes,\" as she reaches up to the Higher Self, exulting in joy. Feel your own happy release at having made the way clear at last for subconsciousness to be a clear, reflective mirror for the Higher Self. Then picture the Angel as sending the gold light about him into subconsciousness through her upraised hands. As it flows into her and her aura, have her lower her hands and project it to self-consciousness--man-enteringhis hands. This golden flow then permeates both of them and their auras, which is the one aura of yourself. Now imagine yourself again in glowing orange. Picture the whole Tarot key as it is. The level of the two figures should be at the level of your own body, for they represent your personality. You'll become the key. You back yourself into it. This technique is a wonderful way to release yourself from the emotional patterns that have kept you from being able to love as you should, from being able to be loved as you should be, from being able tohlfill yourself as you should, and from giving fulfillment to others as you should."}]
