[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC D(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 39 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures This week we will discuss the testing and trying s5rmbolized in Key 14, so that you will understand it more fully. What is it to be tested and tried? We are tested and tried, after a fashion, every minute of every day. It is not something that is occasional; it is a part of being alive. We are always in the midst of the motion of the opposites. We are always having the impact of other levels of consciousness, the impact of other people's thinking and feeling and our reactions to these impacts. Therefore, tests and trials have to do with how we react in any given situation, be it little or big. Sometimes we are more tested and tried by little problems than by big ones. Human consciousness has a way of running to God far more quickly when there is a big problem than when there is a small one. It is when gteat sorrow and overwhelming fears and anxieties sweep you that you become desperate enough to run to something beyond yourself. Even if you do not believe in it, you run to it or reach for it. If you will look back into your consciousness and remember, you will realize that it has always been after the profoundest sorrows and the deepest agonies of your heart that something in you has reached, wept and prayed for God, in whatever way you may have conceived Him. In the little problems we overlook this help. We call them little annoyances. But the little ones add up to make the big ones. It is by our habitual attitudes and reactions that pressure is added to pressure, and in the resulting earthquake lve are overcome by a tidal wave that drags us through the currents of the ocean towards something greater, makes us reach out for something Higher. The secret of transmuting our natures so as not to have the profound agonies that drive us to God is to work with the everyday annoyances and discover that they are not really annoyances. Begin to say, \"I will look upon every circumstance of my life as a particular dealing of God with my soul.\" Every circumstance! Not a selected few. \"My soul,\" in this dictum, is the vital soul, the animal soul that we share with all life below us. Our Higher Soul is the angel, the angel called Michael (which should be pronounced Mee-kie-al), the archangel of the root of fire, the archangel of the sun; and the sphere of the sun is the sphere of Adam, of generic humanit5r, the son of God, the king called Tiphareth. This king that is your Higher Self, the angel, which you have had at all times and in all places, is always working on its vehicle, the personality. The personality is shown here as the two elements of which we have spoken. It is through the combination of the two elements shown in this key that we obtain all of the others and evolve to self-conscious awareness and control of these energies. When, in day-by-day life, things happen and we see them in a certain way and we act in a certain way, we should realize that these areas of action and reaction are those upon which we should go to work. When you are in desperate trouble you run to God. What you should try to do is to behold the Higher Self, your part of the union of God. That part of you is continuous and conscious divinity, even as a ray of the sun is continuous with the sun, or the electricity in a light bulb is continuous with the generator that produces it. Your personalit5r is a continuation or projection of your Higher Self, which is a direct ray of the sun, the All, God."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 39 Therefore, it is in continuous union with God even when your personality does not know this. There is no time in which you have been separated from God! What are testing and trying? Our scientists test and try their theories. If there is an idea, a hypothesis, if so-and-so is thus-and-so, thed that-and-that should result. Tests are conducted to see whether or not the hypothesis is correct. This is what is called the scientific method, the test and trial of an idea. A true occultist also tests and tries. You will never have true supersensory powers until you learn how to work with the ideas that we are discussing, the power of keeping in continuous contact with your source, keeping that contact consciously, to make it a living and daily conscious reality to you. This continuous contact has always existed or you would not be a living being with a mind; you would not be able to see, hear, taste, touch or react. It is because you are in living and continuous contact with your Higher Self that you are a living creature with the miracle and wonder of all the elements that form a physical vehicle as well as all the other vehicles, emotional, mental and spiritual. You have alwa]rs been in contact, even when you have not known it. Testing and trial go on always. If someone calls you a name, your reaction is a test and a trial. If you are exposed to a situation in which you find you cannot control the need to steal, it is the level at which you are being tested and tried, and you have been unable to control the urge, just as wild animals are unable to control their urges. Do you begin to see what is involved in testing and trying? There are small cycles within larger cycles, and we inevitably will have larger tests and trials in some areas. Our reaction, however, when we have achieved a real response of willingness, will be such that even in major tests and trials we will scarcely know that we have been through them. This is one of the secrets of passing. When you know that you are being tested and tried, you still have a problem somewhere in your nature that is being worked on and refined. When you go through certain events without realizing that they were tests, you passed. I met a test of that kind just before I was brought to Dr. Case. I found out that a human being was deliberately trying to destroy me\" I had verification of this from many sources, and my proper reaction to the attack was the very thing that was essential before being brought to Dr. Case to receive the esoteric training for taking over this work. That final test was to determine my reaction, and I did not know it, That was why the test was passed. I was undergoing agony of heart and soul. I did not know what was the matter but had been told by a friend who was clairvoyant that I was under psychic attack. I thought she was mad. But within two days at least six people came to tell me of the physical evidence of the attack. The attacker came to my home, and in the presence of my sister and my child assured me that I would not be alive much longer because of the great power of her mind\" This actually occurred, though I should never have believed it if it had not happened to me. That is one of the reasons that it had to happen to me."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 39 After my clairvoyant friend finally convinced me that something destructive was being directed towards me, she heard a voice identifying himself as my spiritual teacher, telling her that if I would do certain things I would gain control and mastery. I took a pencil and she dictated to me the numbers of several Psalms; neither of us knew which they were. I thought that perhaps now I would be helped. I went home and opened my Bible. Every one of the Psalms had something in it in essence like: \"Lord, destroy my enemy; Lord, I will trample my enemies to dust; Lord, Thou and I will be the victor over mine enemy.\" Every one of them! It was unbelievable how completely they agreed. Here was part of the testing and trying, because this message had come from one who loved me. I was in the position of having received verification of the accuracy of my friend's knowledge. She had attempted to give me help. I was presented with this help, but do you know what happened? My whole heart and soul rose up in rebellion, and I said, \"Lord, if this is the kind of help you send, you can take it back! I have no enemies. Some demented soul thinks I am her enemy; therefore, she may be thinking to hurt me in self defense. She is deluded. I have no enemies and I shall not react by invitingyou to trample my enemies or to help me tread them down!\" I was most disturbed. The hope that I had had was dashed to the ground. I was left with nothing to stand on. I felt, \"What do I do now?\" Then the Guardian Angel spoke, not verbally, but clearly: \"Why don't you do the opposite?\" That is exactly what I did. The minute that I heard from my inner consciousness I knew what to do. Instead of hatred, I sent love and help and healing to the attacker, day and night, waves of love from my heart. Everything changed. Then I was brought to Dr. Case. We were told that this had been the last test that I had to pass before being ready for my real work. I was to be entrusted with so much occult power that it had to be quite certain I could not get angry enough to use it against anyone, even when one was trying to destroy me. You can see what forms some of these tests and trials can take. I knew that love is the only answer for such attacks. I knew it with my heart, and the reason I knew it with my heart was that my personality had been worked on from the divine Higher Self. I understood what the repercussions are from any kind of mental or emotional attitude. Not that I do not become angry. If we were not capable of anger, we would not be human beings. Christ Himself became angry enough to whip the money-changers from the temple. Anger itself is not evil. Don't feel guilty when you are angry. These are surface storms. It is what abides in the heart that is the important thing, not the surface storms that come and go in an instant. Surface storms are not the real you; they are merely the interplay of mass emotion. What is it, then, which has to be tested and tried? It is to have the proper reaction to whatever happens, to know one's self to be guided by the Divine Self even when there is no proof; to have that much faith. Take this idea and test it out in life. Do what the scientist does. Make the assumption that your Holy Guardian Angel, your Higher Self, is in charge of you in all of your ways;just make the assumption. You do not know this until you have experienced it, but act as if this were so. Your laboratory is the laboratory of life. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 39 This is what I found that I must do after I came to Dr. Case. I had so much transmutation of the personality to be done that it seemed a superhuman task (which it really was, of course!) I realized, after I had been with him for about two years, that I had to do something drastic about retraining my everyday reactions. I took Key 14 and painted several copies and put them about where I worked and lived; one in the bedroom, one in the kitchen, the bathroom, over my typewriter. I decided to bombard my consciousness with the Holy Guardian Angel. Then when I was where the key was not, the impact would still be there . I could remember the key, flick my consciousness to it. I kept practicing the presence of God as often as I could. When I typed, the Holy Guardian Angel was doing it. When I gardened, the Holy Guardian Angel was gardening in and through me. If I was upset, the Holy Guardian Angel was bringing in a little steam to transmute me. I did this for a long time, and it worked miracles. I reached a point where I knew those wings covered me and were with me, guiding, guarding and protecting me, no matter what happened. Once when Dr. Case and I were driving, we had a flat tire and he became annoyed. I turned to him and said, \"Just see how lucky we are! See how close we are to a service station! I am sure the Holy Guardian Angel let the tire go flat here because of loving us so much, that we are protected.\" He laughed and said, \"You occultist! But I never heard a more perfect attitude. The point is that I know you really feel it.\" I did. I had no doubt at all that the flat tire was a goodness from God to protect us. We busy ourselves with all the affairs of the world, and no matter how well we practice something, it begins to slip away. Then we eome upen real trouble end run beek end b*grn to practice hard again; so even the trouble has been a blessing because it has returned us to the practice. I can assure you that during the time I went through this discipline, in everything that happened I had an extraordinary reaction, the feeling of being overshadowed by God, by the Higher Self; loved and guided and protected. Things that most people would consider not to be pleasant, I refused to see that way. This is not being unrealistic if you remember that the refiner's fire is the fire of Michael, Archangel of fire, and that this \"fire\" prepares us for higher levels of consciousness. Thus you will realize that whatever we go through it is a necessary experience for the next grade of glory. Do you or do you not believe that God is ever victorious? Do you or do you not believe that the Holy Guardian Angel has you in charge? If you do believe itrthen start practicing it! Stop weeping or complaining about seeming annoyances. Look upon them as blessings, tests and trials for refining, for purifying; look upon them as indications that God loves you. Recognize that there has never been a time in all your life that you have not been under the guidance of the Holy Guardian Angel, your Higher Self. Practice remembering it! Bring it to your consciousness. Walk in that Self. No matter what happens, say to yourself, \"This is God living me. I will look upon every circumstance of my life as a particular dealing of God with my soul. Each experience is an indication that God is growing my personality. I am forever secure. I am forever safe, a resident in the heavens because the Divine One holds me and enfolds me in a love that grows me through problems that are no problems, only challenges that spur my evolution.\" To feel harassed and upset by the problems of life is the wrong reaction and the lower point of view,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 39 Blessed are they who will see that whatever happens has happened under the holy and loving guidance of the divine Guardian Angel, no matter how bad it seems, no matter how evil it has seemed in terms of others or yourself. It is part of the refiner's process, making gold out of lead. You dwell under the shadow of His wing, whose name is Peace, Jehovah. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 14. TEMPERANCE The color of the path of Key 14 is blue. Permeate yourself with blue for two feet around and through your aura. Picture yourself in front of it, with the lion and the eagle at about shoulder level. Back into it so that the lion is on the right hand. Picture the lion as a part of your animal nature that has not yet been humanized, perfected, and put under the control of the Divine. Image the angel emptying the water and the water penetrating and permeating the lion. The water of Superconsciousness transmutes the lion, putting your animal nature in the hands of God. Think: \"My vital nature, my animal nature is in the hands of God. God is transmuting and preparing and purifying it to make it a more perfect instrument for expression.\" On your left side is the eagle. Picture the flame held by the angel as pouring through and through it so that the eagle becomes a living flame. The flame penetrates, purifies and beautifies all the elements that have to do with the scorpion part of your nature, i.e. with change and reproduction. This power to control life and death, once it is transmuted, becomes the full instrument of God. Think of those parts of your nature that are not yet perfected as under the care of God and being worked upon by God. Say to yourself, \"Thou, O Lord of the lJniverse, hath sent my Holy Guardian Angel, the Angel of the Sun, Michael, to enfold me in the wings of Thy love, to guide me, and keep me full of the sense of Thy protective presence--now, yesterday, tomorrow, and always.\" Picture the angel as caressing you from above. Feel His love. Then go out into life and express that love to others. In that way you make room for more. You will find this happening to you automatically. The more you practice feeling the love and the overshadowing presence of the Higher Self, the more you will find yourself loving others! AFFIRMATION: I feel within me the presence of my Holy Guardian Angel. I am overshadowed, loved, guided and protected by that Presence through all the tests and trials that come my way. I am forever secure, forever safe, forever loved."}]
