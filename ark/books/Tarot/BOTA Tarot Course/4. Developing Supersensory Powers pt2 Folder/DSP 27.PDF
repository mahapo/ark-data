[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 27 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures One of the great problems in many cultures is encountered in attempting to train children in the disciplines of life, which is really training them to be human. In this training, if you will stop to think about it for a moment, a grievous error is frequently made. We try to show them how to get their own lion under the control it takes to be a human being. Although only Masters of Wisdom have complete control developed in all areas, we all have some control in different degrees. Childhood training is meant to bring us to the most complete control of which we are capable; the tragedy, in some cultures, is that this training produces inhibitions which are permitted to spread in unwholesome directions. The prime example is sex, because our sex eners/ is so bound up with our own reproductive eners/. In our culture many people grow up with an unwholesome attitude relating to this eners/. They use vulgar language about it and snicker about things related to it. It is presented as something to be ashamed of, to be hidden. Some people have sick, unwholesome responses to this creative energy, which is the fundamental energ' of the lion. Inasmuch as it is the manifested primeval enerry of the universe, one of the first things that we were taught in esoteric tradition was to purify our attitudes and reactions to it. The white robe on the woman symbolizes that purity of attitude we should have towards our own reproductive eners/ and the reproductive ener$/ that acts through all that lives. In purifying our attitudes, we learn to look upon this energ/ with reverence, for this is the wa5r in which the Lord of the LTniverse brings about continuous reproduction, t.re method through which growth and evolution take place. Therefore, it is holy and sacred. We hear so often that he who strives for the very highest in spiritual unfoldment must learn to develop complete control of his reproductive energies. This is true, but it is not usually recognized that what is meant by complete control is the development of a completely different emotional attitude than that possessed by average humanity, On the other hand, when we remember that limitation is a characteristic of humani zation, we can see that those who uphold wild, uninhibited expression of the reproductive ener5/ are going to the opposite extreme. How, then, would we learn to evolve, to direct our energies, focus our concentration? The more human we are, the more we are supposed to have developed a disciplined control and direction of this drive. It is up to us to be masters of ourselves, and to be masters of this creative drive means that we cannot be promiscuous. No person who is promiscuous would be able to maintain an eners/ level high enough to permit awakening of the Kundalini and the development of higher supersensory powers. Promiscuit5i wastes the needed enerry. We must recognize that it is not good for us to be exposed to over-emotional reactions of individuals with unwholesome responses to this energr. We must purify our attitudes by recognizing the energ/ of reproduction as the sacred and holy expression that it is, seeking to express that sacredness in our lives and attitudes. If all mankind recognized this, the extreme problems that have arisen in different cultures could never have developed."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 27 Once you become a true human being, love should be the only reason for expressing the reproductive urge. Animals react on their level of love. The human being should have a higher level. Being able to achieve this attitude towards the sacred energies does more to help the human being attain a state of mystical union with God than any other one thing! The varied blocks and walls of inhibition that we have built into ourselves on erroneous principles must come down. They should be replaced by a higher level of conscious control and understanding. Animals and all creatures below man still live in the Garden of Eden. They are innocent; only man has eaten of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. That is another signiflrcance of this key--the serpent with its symbolism. The Hebrew letter \"Teth\" means serpent. Man must return to the state of innocence on the human level by expressing himself on the human level instead of taking his example from animal levels where human action has no place. What controls this creative enersr in us? It is really a question of whether the subconsciousness has been so humanized that the primal enerry automatically goes in the chosen direction or into the desired expression or whether it runs away with you. For instance, if you lose your temper violently, your tempet runs away with you. If you start to lose your temper and something in you immediately puts a clamp on it and directs it in a different way, you are using your human powers of limitation and direction of the generated energi. Every time you clamp down on some wild emotional expression, you are developing and evolving. Gluttony, the need to take food compulsively, is in the same category and is a misuse of the sex urge. Any kind of wild, unrestrained expression means that we have been letting the lion run loose. It is our task and our destiny to train the lion. Every time we let hate overcome us, the lion has reared its head, Every time we take that hate and control it even a little bit, we humanize ourselves to that degree. Every time we permit uncontrolled outbursts of envy, jealousy, or malice to speak through us, the animal has reared its head; every time we master, control and redirect it, we put another rose in the wreath that we are weaving. Our lion is much more than would appear on the surface, is it not? The lion is magnificent, majestic, something to tame not destroy. This Tarot key is assigned astrologically to Leo, for Leo is the lion. Leo, as- trologically, is connected with the heart and the spine. Here again you see the amazing interrelationships expressed by these ancient symbols when you realize that we have just been discussing the Kundalini which rises upward from the base of the spine. Leo rules the spine and the heart, the love center. In other words, the primeval energr, the driving force, the reproductive enerry of life is transmuted into love, expressed in and through love--the roses. Actually, the Qabalistic training system has been traced back to the beginnings of cultural development. The whole system of Tarot-Qabalah comes to us only when we are ready for the final lap of our journey. I know that you look into your hearts and say, \"But I was jealous of this one; I wanted to tear that one apart; I could have killed the other. What an unevolved soul am I!\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 27 But you might be surprised to know that that is not necessarily what it indicates. It is not so much that you had that surge of emotions; what matters more is what you did about it. Inasmuch as we are the intermediaries (as human consciousness is the intermediary between superconsciousness and the animal consciousness), we serve God in many ways. One of these ways is by receiving the primordial eners/ of God into our being and forming and shaping it in every conceivable way. Of course, as we are learning, we do make some pretty terrible shapes, but still we are shaping and working with this enerry. We are forcing this primordial enerry at all times into manifestation. This process eventually gives to that molded primordial eners/ its start towards self-consciousness. We have to learn not to be upset by the emotional surges that come through us, because this is inevitable. We live in a sea of primordial eners/, and we are cultivating an area within ourselves that opens unto that sea of raw enerry which keeps washing in. We are the means, the channel, which enables lower levels of this primordial enerry to begin moving towards higher evolutionary levels. At the same time, our superconscious level is developing our self- conscious level, the immortal, eternal level of our being. We must finally learn to control the primordial energr of the lion with love, and that takes strength. That is why this key is called \"Strength.\" lt takes just that to keep going in the physical world. To have evolved to our present evolutionary stage has taken unimaginable strength, You are much more evolved than you realize. In attaining self- consciousness you are directing ener$/ even though you may not be aware of it, energies v.'hich lie beycnd 5rour wildest comprehension. lVe are teaching and helpingJou'\"o beconie aware of this control because your next evolutionary step requires conscious, knowing direction. As an advanced student you are receiving the influx of extra force and help from the Inner School. You would not be receiving these concepts if you were not now ready to do more than you have done before. Perhaps one of the greatest problems we have is the inability to realize how strong we actually are. Can you imagine all that you have already accomplished, and the amazing strength developed by your soul? Can you go back in your imagination and think of what accomplishments you have been responsible for, when you realize that you as an individualized center within God have managed to work through innumerable stages of evolution from a single cell, climbing upward through various types of vehicles, learning how to hold primordial energ' in increasingly more complex form, until you finally learned how to hold it in the extraordinary form we call the human body? Do you realize how amazing you are? You are strong! Don't ever let yourself believe that because you weep over certain things and you feel that certain conditions are too much for you, that you are not the strong arm of God. You could not have become an individualized human consciousness had you not had strength and courage. Once you have achieved individualized human consciousness, the final attainment has become inevitable. We may keep going slowly through extra pain or move more rapidly, as we choose. The occult way intensifies our problems in certain ways, but it also gives us the joys of fulfillment, advancingus far more rapidly. We can accomplish in two or three incarnations if we really work, what could otherwise take untold numbers of incarnations."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 27 It really makes that much difference. The advanced student must become aware of the tremendous difference involved here. There is an astonishing difference between two souls who might be walking on the physical earth; one of whom has no interest in anyfhing except material things--money and power--the other soul seeks and reaches and yearns, studies and meditates. You would be amazed at the difference there is in the evolved ages of two such souls and the incarnational lives that are involved. It is beyond anything we can imagine. You would not have attained this advanced position were you that vitally interested in mere physical things. I want you to rcalize that you are really strong no matter how weak you think you are, no matter how many times you have fallen, no matter how difficult it has been for you to come up out of certain situations. You are strong, and this key will help you to become aware of this magnificent magical strength. You are strong because you have compressed from the primordial, raw! screaming ecstacy of No-thing, the essence or substance of primordial consciousness. This primitive matter has been utilized by you in building body upon body in ever increasing complexity, through every lower level up to where you now are. All of this knowledge resides within you; it is the development of your soul because it is the strength of soul that builds ever upwards and nothing else. It is the soul that conquers the wild, primordial, free enerry. That is what you have done--your soul has done to become human. We now must become able to tune in with self-conscious awareness to that basic strength within ourselves. We learn to do this more effectively through an advanced technique. TECH}.IIQIJ'E FOR TAROT KEY NO. 6' STRENGTfi Permeate yourself through and through with yellow, the color of Leo, extending two feet in all directions around you. Make sure the yellow is a living, pulsating color not a dead one. Try to develop within yourself the living, pulsing color of life. After permeating yourself in yellow light, image yourself as being Tarot Key 8. Think of the red lion as that within you which is the driving force, the emotional drive and the emotional reactor. The drive to be anything is what the lion s;rmbolizes. Picture your emotions as that red lion. When things are too much for you, when you feel your emotional or psychic strength is at a low ebb, instantly permeate yourself with this pulsating yellow. Do not let yourself dwell on any feelings of inadequacy. Think of your real emotional nature as being the red lion, this tremendous majestic power, vital, eternal and infinite; the female figure in the key as being a part of you, roses around your waist, crossed over and around the neck of the lion so that they form the figure 8. Realize that love is the essence of trained and directed desire, that love controls and directs this strength. See the female figure with her hands in the mouth of the lion, feel that your subconsciousness has full humanized (which means directed) control of the powers of the lion, and that this is strength, because this makes you impregnable, this is the all power being held and directed positively. See the figure 8 in whirling motion over your head . If suddenly you have a fit of hatred, control it by instantly seeing yourself imbued with this yellow. See the energies that are getting out of hand as the red lion. See yourself as the figure of the woman and put your hands into the mouth of this particular trait or ener5/ that is trying to overcome you. See the roses as winding and controlling it. You will"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 27 5 be astonished at what control you will develop over the mad, wild surges of emotions that all of us have, and that we must not feel guilty about, because the Masters of Wisdom have them just as we do, They come from the ocean of primordial being. The difference between the Masters and us is that they recognize this consciously. Their subconsciousness is so humanized that it instantly adjusts as the reaction takes place and expresses in a form opposite from what it would have otherwise. That is what we are learning to do right now. Remember that you have the ability and strength through the humanized subconsciousness to direct the lion.
