[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 34 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures The Hebrew letter attributed to Key 12, The Hanged Man, is Mem and the meaning of Mem is water, Mem is also, in Qabalah, one of the three Mother letters: Aleph, Mem and Shin. Aleph represents the root of air, Shin the root of fire, and Mem the root of water. The whole feminine aspect of life, the entire birth of lovingness, is said to depend on the great sea, the mother substance. Though you see in this key a figure that appears masculine (it is actually androgmous), remember that this figure is bound up with the power of the supreme Feminine, the cosmic Mother, and that many of the meanings of the key are connected with Her. Let us consider the number twelve itself. Twelve is associated with the twelve signs of the Zodiac. It, therefore, has symbolic meanings connected with completion. Thus the figure is associated with completion even though he is hanging by one leg in what appears to be a very uncomfortable position. I hope you will see this position differently by the end of the lesson. The letter Mem, together with the key itself, is assigned to the Stable Intelligence; firm, still as the pendulum at rest. Each of the keys has attributed to it a type of consciousness related to its path on the Tree of Life. Stable Intelligence means a stillness. It refers particularly to stillness of the mindstuff. Ilsually the nnind i-\" nct still; it is movrng from idea to idea through association. The ideas of reversal and suspension are also depicted in this key. The figure is suspended, and this has to do with a Stable Intelligence. It is also in a reversed position from what we consider right side up. How many of you realize that when we see with our physical eyes, we actually see everything upside down, and that it is the consciousness that puts it right side up; or at least what we consider right side up? I wonder how right or wrong we are! When you consider our interpretation of life on the whole, it might be that this is where the biggest mistake occurs; putting a thing upside down instead of right side up--the reverse of what the optician tells us. This \"upsidedownness\" reversal has many meanings. In particular, it relates to a reversal of our whole basic attitude of mind and heart. There is a very old maxim which is rather shocking. \"Go in all ways contrary to the world.\" To go contrary to the world gives us an idea as to one of the important meanings of Key 12. Look at the world. Look at the antics of politicians and governments; look at their excitement and fury over the most inconsequential matters, and their apathy regarding the great issues of life. Consider the bitterness and bigotry rife in the world. Pick up any newspaper any morning, and headlines of disaster, cruelty, unethical behavior, slander, of almost any crime against God or nature that one can imagine will inevitably grace the front page. And the inner pages are not much better. There is not only much mis-seeing, much reversal of the right in the world, there is an incredible eagerness to publicize evil as well. Those who achieve the greatest fame, if"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 34 one can call it fatne, or notoriety, all too often have nothing to offer except the possession of wealth, notable misbehavior or threatening remarks. One of the easiest ways in which to become well known is to express some kind of hatred in print, Do you remember the headlines when air raid shelters were in the news? One city announced that if anyone from another city fled to them for protection, they would be greeted with guns. This is the way of the world. This is true wherever you go of the majority of human beings, of their basic responses to life. Let us not hide this from ourselves but see it for what it is. If only a few of us recognize it and manage to reverse this thinking and feeling in our own heart, we will have enough influence on the life wave to do our part toward the evolution of humanity as a whole. There is an old saying which expresses this idea beautifully and is obvious if one thinks about it: \"All of the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of one small candle.\" One positive spiritual thought has a power vastly beyond a myriad of negative ones! The whole attitude of, \"I must get mine; I must save myself and the devil take the other fellow,\" is rampant. How clever a man thinks himself for putting something over on another! He is slapped on the back, \"That was a clever move, by George!\" A toast is drunk to his cleverness and success. After all, it was legal! The fact that a thing happens to be in accordance with the laws as they are does not make it ethical. This pattern exists wherever we go. You will hear it said, \"Well, after all, we have to survive.\" Whether due to an irferierity complex or not, notice ho',r'important it is to try to tear down someone else. Some of us do it very cleverly. We even make ourselves sound spiritual in the doing: \"O, I love her (or him) so much, but is it not a shame that. , .\" or \"O well, I suppose that evolution will some day grow him (or her).\" And what have we done? What does it indicate? It indicates an insecurity about ourselves, together with a subconscious idea from the race mind that by belittling someone else, somehow we gain stature. Which, of course, is not at all true. As we come to recognize its untruth, we are less and less inclined to belittle, for we learn that all we really need to gain stature is to live more in accordance with our higher ideals. Some of them may be mistaken and we will find that out through experience and change them, but we must first try. In terms of this key, as we point out the things that reflect the ways of the world, we point out that reversal of these thinkings and feelings is the secret of attaining all things. Our eastern brothers tell us that promptings of the mass mind may be countered by applying the principle of opposite polarity. What is that but using the law of reversal? No matter what our problem is or on what level it falls, whether it be material, emotional, mental or relational, if we come to understand the use of the law of reversal, if we develop willingness to reverse our position, then we shall have developed powers of direction, discipline, control, and attainment beyond our fondest dreams. Without it we will not. In elementary metaphysics, we are taught that everything we picture we can get, which is not incorrect but is only part of the story. Here we can explain a little more clearly why it is that sometimes a particular technique works, and again it does not, and you wonder why, having done the same thing each time. As a matter of fact, you have not done the same thing; it merely seems that you have. It is quite true that everything that exists is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 34 created by thought. There is no argument about that principle. Something thought it, and that Something, the One Thinker, the Divine Thinker, has many aspects that think for the divine on the various levels of unfoldment of growing parts of the Divine Thinker. Some kinds of thinking appear quite warped, and they are, until they grow to a point where they can paint much more beautiful pictures for manifestation. The point is that it is not what you picture that you get. The real secret is this: What you ARE, you become and you experience. WFIAT YOU ARE! If you have problems in material conditions, first of all you must consider, \"What is the problem? Have I a real problem, or am I comparing myself with the Jones'?\" This is the first thing you must understand. Making comparisons immediately takes us into the unconsciously competitive world where we do not belong as occult aspirants. This we have to reverse. We may try to picture ourselves getting that which we desire: money, position, power. But if we have reached a point in our evolution at which we are meant to work at the roots of the problem, picturing things is not going to work out too well. People who are millionaires are very insecure. They worked very hard in previous incarnations, no doubt, to see themselves as having wealth. They thought it and they got it, but they are not secure. They also got all the problems that go with it. Wealth is an unhappy rather than a happy karma for most people, and a very difficult test to pass. It is not something they can take with them when they die. They have subjected themselves to the law of opposites and will have to swing between the polarities yet another while, by virtue of the lack of the oroper attitude evolved from deep rvithin the being. What I am trying to say is that when an aspirant comes to a certain point in his growth, there are tremendous problems because he is being impelled, compelled by the Higher Self to look to the root, to the source of both wealth and poverty as we discussed it in the lessons on Key 10. What we discover is this: There is a basic feeling of insecurity in the human heart, and of course no one except a completely liberated Master can know complete security. This figure, the Hanged Man, is completely secure. He hangs by one leg and the other is folded in back of him. He presents you with a picture of security and stability. If you are emotionally insecure, you are no better off than the mentally unstable. You will repeat the same problems if you do not get rid of insecurity in your nature, insecurity in your emotions, in the heart. What makes people insecure is not what psychoanalysts so often say, that infant environment is the cause. Everything that happened to you was the event you needed in your environment for growth. Your response to it could not have been other than it was. Some people in the most corrupting circumstances remain saints even as children. Some children, in the most wonderful circumstances, become miserable psychological cripples. Children of the most loving parents can turn out to be monsters. The children of brutish parents can be saints, We cannot say, \"I am this or that because of this or that.\" The part played by the environment is to bring out in you what you are at that time, the susceptibility of your soul to the conditioningof the environment,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 34 We are inviting you to go contrary to the world, to reverse some of the ideas, in fact, a good many of the ideas that you have held. Now, what are you to do about the feeling of insecurity? A problem in the professional or material life is caused by emotional insecuritSr and emotional problems, feelings of not being properly appreciated or feelings of loneliness are not the fault of others. The basic insecurity expresses itself in one thing or another because that is the area in which we are being stimulated for this period of growth in order to awaken us to our true needs. What are we to do about it? Reversal! We must reverse our attitudes. When we reverse our attitudes, everything begins to reverse itself in the outer world. But first it must happen within! We may have success while still insecure, of course, but we still will be subject to ups and downs and waverings. We must stabilize that most vital part of our nature for the attainment of real control of the highest forces. Therefore, when we are having a downward cycle, that is the time to learn the lesson, to seek a little more assiduously for the elements that make us feel insecure, and to work at reversing them, How? We reverse them by understanding the real attitude of the Hanged Man and by learning to feel that kind of stability and security in ourselves. Notice the three logs from which he hangs, They form the Hebrew letter Tav, the last Tarot key, called The World, which is assigned to Cosmic Consciousness. He hangs from the law of the cosmos. He hangs from the pattern of the unfolding universe. He is dependent on the cosmic process of unfoldment. He is dependent on the cosmic life. He cleverly has taken a spiraling twisted rope, a whirling spiral motion, the motion of evolution, tied it to his ankle and to the cosmic processes. In other words, he is saying, \"I am dependent upon only the Cosmic Life. I am stable because I am tied to the Cosmic Process, the Cosmic Life. I have nothing to fear; I am secure because the Cosmic Life holds me, even in what looks like a precarious situation.\" The motion of evolution is a strong rope; it is the only rope that will not break. Everything else to which you tie yourself will break, sometime or another, but that will not; that is the secret of security. How does one go about depending on the Cosmic Process? You must reverse your ideas about everythingyou have depended upon, Do you depend on your job for your bread and butter? Nonsense. Your job does not give you bread and butter; Cosmic Life gives them to you. Your job is your contribution to the total work of the universe which you owe to it and it owes to you. It is not the thing that gives you your bread and butter. If you think that it does, you will be subject to the variations of insecurity through several incarnations until you learn better. This does not mean that we should despise our work. It is our attitude towards the job that must be reversed. Most of us look upon the way we make a living as something distasteful to be done and got over with, unless we are among the very few who love what they are doing. There are few in the world who love their jobs. On the whole, however, most of us look upon our work as something we are forced to do so that we can eat and have a few of the pleasures of life. It is very pleasant to have the little pleasures; we have nothing against them; they are desirable to have, but we should look upon them with gratitude and happiness as joys and not the beginning and end of life or the things that show whether we are successes or failures."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 34 What is success or failure? Some people who appear to be the most successful feel that they are the greatest failures. Our whole attitude towards our work must be reversed whether it is washing dishes, pounding a typewriter or baby sitting. It does not matter what it is that we are doing. We must come to recognize and practice this feeling. We must continue to reverse the emotions of the habit patterns; we must reverse the old emotional reactions and work deliberately at letting our hearts pour with gratitude and be able to say, \"Thank you, Cosmic Life, for whatever portion I had today in the work of Thy hand.\" Is one work more important than another? This is the greatest illusion of all. If any of you think that a position that puts one in the limelight is more important than washing dishes in the back of a eafe, you could not be more mistaken. The person who washes dishes may be doing a far greater service than he who is in the headlines, and if he loves what he does, he is really doing a greater service."}]
