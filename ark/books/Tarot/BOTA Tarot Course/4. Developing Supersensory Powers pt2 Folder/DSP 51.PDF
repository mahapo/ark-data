[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 51 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures We are as necessary to our Solar Logos as It is to us, just as anyone of your organs is just as important to you as you are to it. One could not do without the other. Pain, in itself, as we work it out, gives us the capacity to free ourselves from the coffins of ignorance that you see depicted here. Up to a certain point, we experience much pain in our evolution, but there does come a time at which we do not need that kind of pain any more, because our personality has achieved such a feeling for, and knowledge of, and unity with the rest of life that it, in a personal life, does not require any more of the compression of the inner essence of pain. The personality that reaches that level of evolution is not completely free of pain. Not unless we all remain in the boat can we come to land. Therefore, even though each of us individually can reach an evolutionary point at which we do not have personal pain or personal problems, having evolved beyond them, yet we are part of total Being, individualized, yet still a part of the Whole. Everything interlinks and works in unity. We are all responsible for the full development of the Whole, just as your liver is responsible for certain services to the whole body. When we achieve that level of knowingness, that level of awareness, we feel a oneness with all living creatures. It is then our responsibility to bring down the vibrations in and through the regenerated personality to help heal, to help overcome, to help comfort, to help release others from pain. These vibrations are symbolized in Key 20 by the rays emanating from the angel's trumpet. That is what I discovered, as a result of having both the experience of the All Pain, and the experience of the rapturous level of All Love and Ecstasy. I know, from the bottom of my soul, that every single one of us, when he goes through problems, when he goes through pain, does so, not for himself alone. We go through these things for God and for each other, for those levels of life that are below us and for those levels of life that are above us, for that is how we reach to the level next above. I know that liberation from the anguish and the hostilities that we hold because of the patterns of yesterday comes in this way. Only when we see all past experience with its limitation, with its pain, as having been the portion that we helped lift off the burdened shoulders of all humanity, only as we see it in that manner, do we begin to become truly liberated from the negative patterns that keep us full of anguish and hostility, full of sorrow and self pity and hopelessness. Often I have tried to explain this idea to others by quoting the saying of Jesus \"and I, if I be lifted up, shall lift all others unto myself.\" This is a beautiful and inspiring message, but I have found that one has to describe the details of what is involved in it, otherwise the inspiration is but for a moment, Soon we are grieving about something again. Therefore, we need something to help us completely change our attitudes towards coffins, so that we can be released from them, from our emotional and mental responses, from our limitations of thinking and feeling, from our incapacities to love. No human being has the full capacity to love. We still hold resentments of anger or blame for yesterday's experiences. To the degree that they are still with us (and we all have them), to that degree our ability to love is limited and damaged; it is that much of a problem. This is why it is so very important to learn to change our attitude towards past"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWEILS: 51 things. If we will but realize that every pain that we have ever had is what grew us, we will be exercisingproper evaluation and judgment. Sometimes this does not give us enough comfort, because we have not yet been released from the coffins, have not yet accepted our pain and are not yet willing to die to yesterday, When you die to yesterday, you thereby open yourself to rebirth. Only then can you truly say \"This miracle of awareness that I am is worth everything that has ever happened to me, The capacify to love that I have is the result of the deepening of the cup of my emotions through experience that includes pain. The attainment of what I yearn for will come, because I have been willing to see my past as my share of the pain that is part of the growth pattern and have been willing to give up that pain, to stop clasping it to my breast\"\" We nurse our pain, This is what makes the coffins. That is how we fail to transmute pain. One thing that you must realize is that unless we work at releasing our adverse reactions to things that have occurred and see them rather as something beautiful, glorious, and right for that time and condition, we are in no state to be opened up to the fourth dimensional conscious experience. When we give the technique, we shall discuss it in terms of the kind of consciousness to which we hope you will attain. As part of the technique for using this Key, we shall do something that we have not done in any of the other Tarot techniques. We shall include the vibrational elements that are so closely involved in this Key. Gabriel blows his horn. This has to do with sound. You will learn in a future course, Sound and Color, that the ideas related to sound have to do rviih learning how- to use the pow-er of vibraiion io awaken the sleeping spiritual qualities, to hasten the disintegration of the old, to eradicate the patterns that are death patterns or coffin patterns, to make ourselves able and open to the influx of the higher kind of knowing. Learning to do this is the practice of mantra, Qabalistic mantra, the use of what are called words of power. With this technique remember what is connected with Key 20 and use the principles and symbolism involved to the fullest extent. The use of combined vibrational powers and color makes them much more potent. The mantra element we shall employ has to do with intensifying the alterations within our being, hastening the emanations from within ourself, from our atomic structure. We continuously emanate atoms of our being; it takes ten months, science tells us, for every atom in our bodies to have been eliminated and other atoms taken in. The regenerated personality, as Key 20 symbolizes, can be built by acquiring the right atomic pattern, but this must be done consistently. Once one understands the full growth process, it takes time for new atoms to be absorbed, and we automatically absorb from each other and from the levels on which our consciousness has learned to dwell. The reason that we remain in the coffins of the old negative patterns is that our consciousness and emotions remain in those subconscious patterns, so that we attract our atomic structure from an electromagnetic field in harmony with what we are. This is the law of attraction. As we learn to hold other states of mind and emotion (and working with the Tarot, the actual laws of consciousness, we do it far more rapidly), we can hasten this interchange and hold positive elements as the old ones are being eliminated. Thus we do not repeat our"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 51 old forms, we are not caught in the same cycle over and over again. Our problems, when we look back upon them, usually hold a certain pattern. We flrnd that ordinarily it takes a human being a minimum of three incarnations to overcome one pattern of ignorance, the coffin element. The occult aspirant, naturally, hastens this process. Those who really aspire deeply and work consistently can make many transmutations in one incarnation; how many depends on the growth, and evolution, intensity of work, and the regularity of spiritual work and exercise that have to do with aspiring. We want you to keep in mind in relation to this technique that you are going to be aiding yourselves and hastening the elimination and reabsorption process. At the same time, remember that only as you discipline yourself with the various Tarot Keys, holding positive states of mind and heart and watching your attitudes, will you be able to build a more evolved form from atomic elements. For these elements are but an apparent outer electromagnetic force, dependent upon the inner self. Consciousness is at the heart of the whole process. About six years ago an experiment was made in examining the growth process of tad- poles. Electronic microscopes were used, and pictures taken were flashed on a phosphorus screen during the development of the tadpole into a frog. I have never understood why this experiment and its results were not headlined throughout the world, and why more work has not been done along these lines. It was found that the tadpole had an electromagnetic pattern, \"a shadow\" force field surrounding its physical form, and that before the tadpole Iost its ph5rsical tail, the electromagnetic \"shadow\" lost its tail and the physical form followed suit within a certain time. Before the tadpole grew the legs of a frog, the electromagnetic pattern showed the legs, and then the flesh was incorporated. Flesh itself is merely atoms held in a certain electromagnetic force field, held by consciousness. Therefore, we must change our consciousness, in order to change our forms of expression, both as a vehicle and in an environmental way. The reason that I tell you this is to make you realize that this is a potent technique; something immediate. You, like the tadpole, have an electromagnetic force field. Clairvoyants can see it. They see it as your etheric body. Since your etheric body manifests before your physical body, changes must occur in the subtle elements before they take place in the physical elements. That change creates the pattern and something is taken away or added, as in the experiment with the tadpole. The technique that we shall perform with this Key concerns forming our electromagnetic force field so that it is in harmony with the Higher Self image of us as we are destined to be. We do not have to consciously form any image, because what we are destined to be is already in the mind of God. We are in process, just as an embryo may look like a fish with gills inside the mother's womb at a certain time, but it is destined to be born looking like a human baby. There is a certain form that is already held in the mind of the Higher Self. This form is what we are growing toward. We are trying to work with it more consciously and intensify the process. Though we cannot escape any part of it, for growth is growth, we can go through it more rapidly. This is what is called forcing the evolution. We must have the courage to go on ahead, for we are the pioneers, so that we can help others more effectively."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORKON SUPERSENSORYPOWERS: bl That is why we are herel this is our destiny, or we should not be working together spiritually. Therefore, I am going to give you the mantra to help develop the necessary vibrations. One of the things to remember in using the mantra is this: very rarely does anyone use it correctly at first. It takes months to manage doing it properly, unless you are a trained singer. Some take years to master it. The use of Qabalistic mantras is a specialized form of exercise for our aid, for our evolution. Until you develop muscles in the solar plexus which will enable you to hold your breath and use the larynx in a special way through prac- tice, you will not experience its full impact. Do not try once and give up. It takes tifue. tf you want to achieve freedom from pains and frustration, then do not be discouraged when using the mantra;just practice. Mantras or Qabalistic intonations, the words of power before mentioned, have to do with the angel Gabriel, whom you see depicted in Key 20, One of the two words that we shall intone is the divine name for the physical plane. Each of the Sephiroth, the emanations of God, has a divine name, This does not mean, of course, that there are ten Gods on the Tree of Life, but that there are ten ways in which the one God manifests. Each of the ways is a special manifestation, and its vibration, therefore, has its own laws and rules, just as you do not act the same in your role of mother as you do in that of student, or teacher, or sister. Each expression is peculiar to a particular relationship. The divine name employed through the ages for the physical plane is Adonai. We el'ra3's use a Civine name as an invocation in spiritual work, because, in so doing, we say, in essence, \"All that is about to be done, all that I am doing, comes from the Divine and is done for the Divine, for the Lord of Life, for God.\" This is the difference between white magic and black magic, the difference between working with love and working with selfishness. Occult powers can be perfected by people who are low on the evolutionarv scale. Though they may have ability, they use their powers for antisocial ends. You are making a declaration, when you intone the divine names. It is a shorthand form of meditation. As an aspect of God, in all things that you receive or send, you give yourself to God, \"I do the will of the Father-Mother; I reach for the will of the Father-Mother.\" Hence we intone \"Adonai.\" Remember, as you begin this technique, that this path refers to the R'oot of Fire. This Key is the fire of life, the awakening. Everyone who has ever had a realization on the mystic level and has experienced this aspect oi eternit5r, has reported that it has been like a fire glowing all through himself and everything else. The fire of life is what we are thinking about as we permeate ourselves with ihis .olor, the fire of life in terms of the higher level of consciousness. We bring the higher down, in and through our physical vehicles, to release us from all of the imprisonments of our past and our present. First permeate yourself and your aura with a brilliant, crimson red. Mentally picture this Tarot Key as being above you and slightly to your rear. Thus holding this Key above"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 51 you, it helps to stir the consciousness upward and inward. The mantras that you will intone are the divine names, Adonai, and that of the archangel Gabriel. Next, hold in your mind the idea that you are inviting the Divine Fire of the Lord of Life, Adonai, and Its archangel Gabriel, to permeate you and help dissolve all negative patterns, the coffins, that stand in the way of your being in the light of the highest level of your true selfhood, your eternal immortal beingness. All obstructions will be burned away by the light and love of God, through Its archangel and messenger, Gabriel. This is the thought or idea you hold. Then take a deep breath and intone on whatever note is natural for your voice; Ah-do-nah-ee. If you find that you can't hold the note very long, practice will eventually increase the time you can hold it. After intoningAdonai, send up a wave of love to permeate all of the figures in this Tarot Key. Say, \"I invite the fire of love and God to regenerate my personalitSr completely through my awakened self and subconscious mind.\" Then take a deep breath and intone Gah-bree-ale. While you are intoning Gabriel, imagine that Gabriel is blowing the horn, sounding the note with you. See the seven waves that vibrate from his trumpet pouring down filling you with the fire essence of the transmuting love of God. See it as golden yellow, penetrating through and through, into every atom of your being. Intone Adonai three times and Gabriel three times. Having done this, meditate for a moment on the fact that you are an eternal, immortal aspect of the most High, the child of Adonai, awakened by Gabriel, or being awakened by Gabriel. Let your heart reach for the consciousness of that level, the field of the angel. That is the technique and it is very potent. Do not intone the divine or the archangelic name more than thrice. These are words of extreme power. As you work with the Keys, take one a day, if you can. Try to keep that day full of the awareness of its import. Attempt to live the principles of that Key. You will have wonderful results in this way, because you will be taking the techniques out into your life. The real impact comes from living these techniques. As you pursue one technique a day, you will find that they become more and more a part of your very cells, which is what we are working for. This technique is aimed at helping you change the cell structure held by the atoms, but all of the Keys are essential for that work. AFFIRI{ATION: I invite the Fire of Life to permeate me and awaken me. As the God essence descends into my field of activity, I am released from the coffins of negative habit patterns that have kept me from seeing the beautiful vision of my essential divinity."}]
