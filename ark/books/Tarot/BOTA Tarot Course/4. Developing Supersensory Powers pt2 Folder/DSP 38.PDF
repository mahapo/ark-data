[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 38 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures This week we will show you how to use Tarot Key 14, Temperance. Key 14 is assigned, astrologically, to Sagittarius. The astrological attribution is clearly represented in this design. The rainbow over the head of the angel represents symbolically the bow of the archer, Sagittarius. With this key are associated the basic Qabalistic ideas that have to do with the tests and trials of an aspirant. I know that all of you have read in novels descriptions of the tests, trials and various initiations that an aspirant must pass before he is permitted to proceed. These are merely dramatizations of an idea which has much deeper implications in terms of our everyday drama, the growing of the personality. It is easy to be led somewhat astray by detailed descriptions of occult work in such novels for they are romantically and excitingly presented. However they are enlightening in an allegorical way if one remembers that they are completely fictional in explaining the ideas that have to do with initiation. The tempering and testing of the aspirant are clearly shown by the Hebrew letter assigned to this key, Samekh, which means \"peg.\" The peg is that which holds the tent down or supports the tent for Samekh also means \"prop.\" The basic idea of the letter is one of stability, the foundation of the evolving structure that is the personality. The Hebrew letter also connotes the idea of testing and trying because a prop must withstand the elements or the tent falls. The prop must be both self-supporting and able to support\" The type of consciousness depicted here is the Intelligence of Probation and Trial. Qabalistically, lhere ai'e two very significanb interpretaiions of the meaning oi'rhe letter and of the key itself. They symbolize wrath on the one hand and verification on the other. In the context of the key, wrath is not used in quite its usual meaning. Whenever we believe that we are being tested and tried (and it is the one thing of which we are usually sure), we are not happy about it. The average person reacts to the testing and trying aspects of the Life Power by feeling despondencies, that the world is against him, people are against him. He thinks that the wrath of God, so to speak, creates the trying situation or condition, Even if he says to himself, \"It must be my own fault, I am paying off karma,\" there is still the underlying notion of being subjected to the wrath of something. Wrath and verification seem a rather ill suited pair of Qabalistic attributions, especially when you consider that what we see depicted as the chief figure of the key is an angel, and angels are not normally supposed to represent wrath. This angel both does and does not. When you understand exactly what is meant by testing and trying, you will respond differently to what comes to you, whether it be a h\"ppy or an unhappy experience. By responding differently, \"walking in all ways contrary to the world,\" you will live in a different world. Actually, in a sense you will be on a different planet even though people look the same in outward appearance, and even that will change. The two creatures depicted on the key must be understood in terms of the key's meaning. The lion you have seen before. Although he is a different color here, he still represents symbolically the same thing as the lion in Tarot Key 8 who was worked upon and changed. He represents the animal nature, the animal soul that all of us share\" This is our driving, unevolved consciousness. This is the primeval part of the consciousness that is being shaped by the Higher Self. In Tarot Key 8 we showed it in terms of the humanized"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 38 subconsciousness gaining control throu$h the faculties of higher levels. Here we see the lion in another guise. We see it being wrorked upon directly by the angel, the Higher Self. The eagle you have also seen before. It stands with the lion on Tarot Key 10. Here you see the eagle more fully. Remember that the eagle refers to the sign of Scorpio. In our last lesson we discussed Scorpio in connection with Tarot Key 1\"3, Death. The higher aspects of Scorpio relate symbolically to the eagle and the lower aspects to the scorpion for which the sign is named. Two such different s5.mbols for the same astrological sign should not surprise you when you remember that Scorpio rules the reproductive organs. Scorpio is the sign symbolizing the force that is behind the drive for mating, whether in plant, animal or human life. This is the enerry utilized by the Life Power through which it grows itself continuous vehicles, in and through which it develops gteater areas of self awareness. Remembering what you have already been told concerning Scorpio as the sex energies, we will now show you another way, show you how more effectively to transmute both the animal nature represented by the lion and the driving, procreative nature represented by the eagle. In a sense you can already see how this is accomplished by observing in what kind of activity the angel is engaged. He pours fire on the water and water on the fire. Leo is a fire sign and water is being poured over the head of the lion. Scorpio is a water sign, and fire is being poured over the head of the eagle. Fire and water make steam. That is one of the reasons why we are in such a state of turmoil most of the time. This is the process of transmutation, no matter what the outward signs of it may be. When you see people in an uproar, \"all steamed up,\" instead of drawing the obvious inferences, you may say to yourself, \"The Holy Guardian Angel is getting up the steam in them.\" This is the process of refinement. When we process metal, it is refined by fire, tempered. The tempering process is another aspect of this key as the name \"Temperance\" indicates. The personalit-v is in the process of being tempered, of being refined, whether it knows it or not. Depending upon the evolutionary level of the personality, the tempering can be violent, generating \"steam\" in all directions so that one is befogged, or it can be done in a controlled manner as shown here. It is the attitude and the reactions that are the controlling factors, The true meaning of the testing and trying lead to a proper understanding of initiation. Many believe that initiation is a single event. This is not true at all, At any time that you become a different sort of personality as a result of tests and trials, pain or heartbreak, you have gone through an inner initiation. Initiation is a continual process and there are many levels of initiations. When you finally achieve a certain point of growth, when you finally reach a stage at which, if your doll falls and breaks, you are able to say, \"It was only a doll,\" then you have been initiated into the next stage of growth and will have a new doll to break, but do not be discouraged by that either. A friend once wanted to know, \"When will this ever end?\" I was talking to him about the testing and trying and the need to learn what kind of attitude to hold, and he said, \"Yes, but when will it ever end?\" I said, \"When you once accomplish something on one"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 38 B level, at one point, all I can promise you is that you earn better trials.\" Perhaps this was cruel, but sometimes one has to be cruelly frank in order to say something that will make an impact. Most of the time we do not want to hear that which will bring us pain. But when we learn how to work with the principles of Key 14 we have less and less pain because we learn to retain the proper attitude. The lion and the eagle do not fight the angel. Yet, how many times a day do we fight with the angel? We quarrel with the angel if anything antagonizes our animal nature: anger, jealousy, hurt feelings, even rejections\" When I spanked my little dog, Tzaddi, for something that I thought required spanking, for several hours thereafter whenever I called her she would deliberately get up to show me that she had heard and walk to the opposite end of the room. She was punishing me for rejectingher, She was rejectingme in turn. If you thinkthat little creatures have not all the traits that we see in ourselves, you are mistaken. It is useful as well as lovable to have pets and study them. In observing animals you will become aware of the many human traits that come from the animal part of our nature. I thought this was very endearing of Tzaddi to try to punish me. The reason I was able to think so was because I had for a long time been practicing knowing the presence of the angel. I thought that it was in complete accord with Qabalistic principles that Tzaddi should attempt to temper me inasmuch as she would achieve growth as a result of the repercussions of her need to reject. We are no different in this regard. Most of the time the lion in our nature cannot let another person win. It seems to us that we have been made to look less than we are\" A negative trait of Leo is tremendous egotism, the need to be king. Every sign has a negative and a positive trait, and with every sign you have both functioning. It depends on your evolutionary level which functions more often. When we learn that the negative aspect of Leo is this need to be king or ruler, to be praised continually, we should reflect that this is really the weakness of us all, not just Leos. We are the zodiac; therefore, in respect to this negative aspect we can see why we find it necessary to become annoyed or hurt when anyone seems to have done or said something that belittles us, according to our immature point of view. We have not enough humorl we do not see the lion as being that part of our nature on which our Holy Guardian Angel is working. We are too self-identified with the nonsensical traits in our nature. We need to develop a great deal more humor about them. With the n6xt key we will show you how to do both. The steam that shows a combination of opposites comes from this cooling off of the animal nature. It is curious how rarely we value human relationships to the point where the thought of our own ego or our own need to be superior is so unimportant that we would be willing to admit to erroro even when we are right! How often we ruin relationships because we have to be right!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 38 One habit of mine amuses and sometimes exasperates my associates. I value human relationships so much that often if I notice that one close to me is angry and upset, I apologize even when I know that I am right. I tell him how wrong I was and how right he was. You may say that I am catering to the lower nature, that I am an appeaser. Not really, Once you can hring a person to feel less hostile, to feel that you are with him, that you are willing to be wrong, curiously he will often say, \"No, you weren't at fault,\" and be willing to look at himself. It is a good device that we can use only if we do not have to be too important. If we have to be too important we will be too proud to do this, and that is another trait of the Leo, too much pride, something that gets us all into trouble. The positive side of this leonine quality is a marvelous, majestic, self-assurance that demands respect. But we all suffer from false pride. It seems important to see ourselves, picture ourselves in flattering situations. In order to be sure that our pride is uppermost, we rationalize continuously without consciously realizing what we are doing. There is a way to overcome these tendencies, We all do it as human beings, but not in the way we should when we attain to the higher supersensory levels. Every apparent negative trait has a positive side which we experience from the higher level of the angel who does the work. From this level we discover another element, a sense of the awe and responsibility of kingship. As our consciousness becomes more harmoniously attuned to our Higher Self, the angel, we discover a sense of overwhelming reverence and pride in who and what we are, as against the smaller emotions of the persqnali{,. It i.s not a mattg1 qf getting-rid qf sq-qalle{-49gqrlr,v-e-qrfAlit-leq bu! of transmuting them into higher expressions, The reverence is for all aspects of our being, especially for those too often held in contempt. For ages expressions from the unevolved levels of the mass human consciousness have been used to point with dirty fingers at certain parts of the anatomy. When people want to express scorn of another they use degrading terms for various parts of the anatomy. Very often they go farther and use vernacular words for the function of those parts. Then they feel they are heaping coals of fire upon others. People seem to have a need to use such language in relation to those they dislike. Men do this more than women, but I have been given to understand that when a woman is angry enough she can outdo any man. A tragic condition exists in our culture in the shame we feel for perfectly respectable organs, instincts and functions. This must be transmuted in our minds to prepare the way for the beauty of testing and trial which have nothing to do with pain but make pain something of the past. We must realize consciously that unevolved people have come to think that filthy language expresses masculinity. It does anything but! A man who is truly masculine does not need to use foul language. He can afford to be tender because he is sure of his masculinity. It is a sad thing that boys in our culture are exposed to filthy language with the idea that the use of such language proves that they are masculine and strong. The very reverse is true. We mention this because Scorpio, the eagle, rules the reproductive functions and also the parts of the body that have to do with excretion."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"/ CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 38 What does this misuse of language do to our consciousness? People who employ such language have perhaps not realized that every word we use is a word of power. Every word we use presents an image to our consciousness, Therefore, if we use words which equate bodily functions with impurity, with degradation and filth, we are continually dropping into our subconsciousness ideas of impurity, filth and dirt. We cannot then be as open as we should to the etherealizing of the vehicle that brings us supersensory awareness, not lower psychic experiences, but true supersensory powers. Because the reproductive enerry is the evolutionary energF of the Lord of the Universe, we should see that we, at least, do not use it for terms of abuse to others. If others so use it, we should not condemn them, because this too is wrong, but we should guard ourselves against adverse repercussions. Why should excretion be looked upon as something shameful? If it were not for manure, for refuse returning into the earth to enrich it, we should have no life\" This is a part of the process of beauty. The reason we stress this is because of the way your own elimination is blocked if you are in the habit of using such terminolog', mentally or verbally, to express anger or annoyance. There are many adequate words with which to express annoyance. By all means use them. However it is a sign of poverty of consciousness and vocabulary to degrade and besmirch any operation of the physical vehicle. The body and its functions belong to God; all of it is beautiful and wondrous, not merely some of it. Most of you already feel this, but even though you do you should understand the principle and work with it more. If you are detaehed about these functions. without strong feelings. it is sur\"prising. considering the strong indoctrination that takes place in our culture. Authors of modern novels sometimes use flrlthy language because of their desire to accurately portray the kind of talk one may hear in smoking rooms, barber shops, the slums and saloons--the way some people converse. Sensitive people find this offensive. Personally, I see no literary advantage in shocking the readers in this way, any more than I would see any artistic merit in a picture of a cesspool. This is not realism, of course, but only the way deluded human beings, caught up in mass mind consciousness, view normal worthwhile functions of the body. Realism is God, the beauty of the rainbow, the wonder of the creative spheres, and the wonder of the vehicles that work with them. Detachment is not enough; we must feel the positive, the wondrous quality, even in the excretory function, Your very words have far reaching effects. The way in which you use words when you are angry, what you accept as being clean or dirty, or pure or impure, all of these things interfere with your experience of the beauty and perfection of the Holy Guardian Angel. The refiner's fire is not necessarily a painful thing; it is painful only to that part of the nature that fights it, that tries to cling to yesterday, or to attitudes of pride, ambition, condemnation, and impure thinking or feeling! We do not need to have that pain. It is time we transmuted it and learned how to attribute every act, word and occurrence to the beauty and wonder of the Holy Guardian Angel in and through ourselves and our environment. This week pay special attention to the way you use words. Watch your speech and actions and try to consciously feel the presence of the angel in every aspect of your experience."}]
