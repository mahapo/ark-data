[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 43 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures We have many kinds of awakenings on many levels. As we work to separate our True Self from our personality, as we are able to see the vanities and the dramatizations and the weaknesses therein and laugh at them, it is amazing how each of the little traits starts to melt away, at least to melt away as a danger, and this is the important thing. You have to work at it, but through mirth you can laugh the devil away. You laugh at your own nonsense and melt away the thing that gives you sorrow and despair; melt away loneliness with the fire of purification. I became aware of this duality of subtle thinking and feeling processes that go on in our nature fairly young, and my first experience with the lightning was most revealing to me. The thing that helped me in this was that I had a sense of humor. Almost every one in my family has the ability to laugh at his own little idiosyncracies. We smile at ourselves. The flash that came to me was staggering because it came in a way different from the usual. My consciousness actually lifted itself up into a dual state so that part of me was the observer and part the actor, the patterned personality, the little strutting, emotional, intellectual part of the nature. There was an all-seeingness involved, an ability to pierce. Note that the lightning has a piercing quality. That has to do with the Magician. The Hebrew letter for the Magician, Beth, is connected with the idea of an arrow, and self-consciousness is the quality of being able to look, to concentrate. I was aware of a sharplv piercing higher level of consciousness from which tr watched myself reacting for a good twent5r minutes. I watched myself going through real despair, because I had had a very unhappy experience. I watched the tears, the emotion, the self-pity, the feeling of blame going on within me, and as I watched it that Higher \"f \" was reinterpreting what had happened by the light of that lightning, and the reinterpretation was illuminating. What I was able to see from that higher level was the fact that I was being a spoiled, self-centered little infant. Things had been getting a bit dull, so I was brewing up a storm. This came from the higher interpretive level; it could never have come from the personality, the intellectual level. From that experience I came to see exactly how and why the personalit5r dramatizes in this way continually, If there is anythingthat we cannotbear it is boredom. Boredom is the ultimate of horror, Ifence, we act to relieve boredom with our personalities because we have not yet learned to look and see and direct. We must learn to accept the needs of the personalit5l in terms of this dramatization, and at the same time see them from a higher level. As we do this, we begin to become aware of all the little things we do. Recently I made a remark to a companion, and he said to me, \"You are just angling for a compliment.\" I stopped and thought a moment and said, \"That is true. You are right, but you are not a kind or a loving or a perceptive soul.\" \"What do you mean?\" he said. I replied, o'ff I were angling for a compliment, there must have been something in me that needed approval. Would it have hurt you to give me that approval? Would it have injured you? Would you have had to lie?\" He said, \"No.\" I said, \"Then you deliberately withheld a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 43 compliment even though I was unconsciously trying to receive one. That was reprehensible of you. I think you should meditate on that.\" Again, we point out that it is not that we should be distressed with what we find. It is that we must be able to see what we really are at our personality level. We have to face this reality. We must let the light shine. Later we will show you what it is that we have to work on to know what we really are. We do that consistently in order to try to help you experience that level more and more. What we teach is conscious union with the Higher Self. We must work at this with every Tarot key\" We must come to recognize that our personalities cannot run our lives. We must come to recognize that our misinterpretations of experiences and our dramatizations are not important to the Higher Self. We must recognize that in every one of us resides the potential to do anything that anyone else has done under the proper impetus. We must recognize that we are exactly like our fellow brother and sister except, perhaps, a little older than some, and that under certain conditions we might do anything they might do. If we do not recognize this in ourselves, we are hiding from ourselves. We are hiding in a tower. By recognizing this, we manage to transmute not only ourselves but others. Let us realize with all our hearts and souls that the main reason elementary metaphysics fails so often to bring happiness and fulfillment is because we work on affirmations for things or situations or conditions, whereas it is what we are, what expresses itself in our habitual ',vord patterns that makes our environment. Vvtrat w-e ai'e for\"rris the buiidirrg blocks of our universe, and this is the secret of all attainment. What we are is the secret of it all. Therefore, what we are should be our main, indeed, our only concern. It should concern us beyond all things; waking, eating, walking, working, sleeping. We can discover what we are by watching what we say to ourselves and to others\" We do not have to know our past incarnations. If we needed to know this, we would have experiences of them with proper verifications. There is no clearer evidence of what we are than what we experience in our world at the moment. This does not mean that if we experience sorrow, we are evil. We experience sorrow because some aspect of our interpretation of things is expressing itself. What we are will show itself to us in our words, if we become as watchful as we should be; show us the root cause of that particular sorrow. We discover the cause when the light of the divine sun flashes its lightning into the prisons of false knowing, of immature being, illuminating our misunderstandings and misinterpretations. When we begin to reach for the change of beingness, then everything changes outside. Otherwise, we are mired in the opposites of grace and sin, the pair of opposites assigned to this Tarot key. We swing from riches to poverty; we swing from fulfillment to want, back and forth. We swing wildly because our minds and hearts reach for the various things that we desire. It is right for us to yearn for all good. It is right for us to yearn for fulfillment, for love, security, for all things lovely, because God is beauty. What we must do is become what we want to experience. This is the secret behind it all, Becoming it is not easy\" We have never told you that it was. Nevertheless, there is a way that is easier than other ways. That is the way of using the Tarot and the Tree of Life to reshape and awaken these parts"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 43 3 of our nature, to become them. The Tarot helps us to become the thing that is and will be our fulfillment. If we are lonely, it is not that we have not the capacity to love. Everyone has the capacity to love because everyone is a part of love, which is God. We are lonely because we are afraid to be hurt, or afraid that we are not lovable. We are afraid to expose ourselves to rejection, which is being afraid to be hurt. We cover this up with all the excuses that we can. This concerns any and every area of our lives. We have to become. Becoming means practicing being that which you want to become, and that is practicing reality. If you assign your selfhood to the Higher Self instead of to the personaligi, you can in all honesty begin to think of your true Self as being the expression of the qualities that really relate to the Higher Self, such as love, friendship, compassion, cooperation, beauty, and kindness. All of these things we have to become by training ourselves with the words we give ourselves. That is the reason it is said in occultism so much, \"Watch your speech!\" People have misunderstood this; they have believed they could think and feel a negative thing, but if they were careful not to say it, then the repercussions would be magically limited. But they are saying it if they say it in their mind. Usually they will also say it to someone in words. Words are the key we must watch for in order to become what we are destined to be. Reach consistently for that. Stop taking the good and bad, rights and wrongs of your personality as seriously as you have in the past. Love it; don't let it run away with you; don't let yourself fall into the trap of your personality. In the whole mass mind, all of the negative, separative thoughts and emotions exist. We swim amongst them, and every time we let ourselves hold a negative thought or emotion, we tie ourselves to the values of that level of thinking, Every time we lift our consciousness to the Higher Self and affirm the higher elements and powers of our nature, we weaken that part of the mass consciousness as well as train our portion of subconsciousness to be tuned to that which we really are. The secret is becoming. When you become love, how can you ever need love from anyone? It will come to you. When you become compassionate you will receive compassion, but you will be much more concerned with giving it. You also must become friendship. People so often say, \"I need a friend; I want a friend.\" You must become friendship, for the sake of the Life Power. We are together. We cannot separate from each other, no matter how many secret towers we build on isolated spots, no matter how much we delude ourselves that we are alone. We cannot escape from one another. Why not enjoy each other? You will enjoy all of life when you develop an awareness of the unity of all. This brings you out of the dream of separateness we have all fallen into. Compared to the few moments we give to our study and practice, how many moments do we give to fearfulness, loneliness, despondency? These are the impacts of life, the tests that we must meet. When they come, wake up, see whence they come, refuse to own them, refuse to accept them, Look upon these phases merely as the washings of unevolved mass consciousness, which wash through you as well as others, and refuse to accept them as your own. Refuse to say, \"I am lonely,\" or \"f am poor,\" or \"I am sorrowful,\" Refuse to accept them; become the beingness of the Light. Weaken the strain of the lower levels. As you weaken it for yourself, you weaken it for others, and you do more; you prepare yourself for more awakening to follow."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 43 I want to remind you that when the lightning strikes, when we suddenly see ourselves in colors that we have not seen before, we are apt to become upset as is shown here. This is the thing above all, that with all my heart and soul I yearn to help you understand. I yearn to be able to eliminate from your awakening experiences the overwhelming shock of self-discovery, and yet you must seek this self-discovery. We have already too much pain and shock in the world. I yearn simply because I am selfish! Shock and pain are something that I am extremely aware of in the consciousness of those parts of myself that are also you. I am selfish. I wish to be more comfortable. In order to be more comfortable, we must learn how to laugh at ourselves. I told you the secret in our lesson on Key 15, and I am repeating it. When the shocks come, when you awake to some aspect of your personalit5r, do not align yourself with whatever it is that you have discovered. Keep your humor. Know that it is only the fumblings of a little child in that area of your life. Trust the Higher Self; say, \"Look what I have discovered now. I thought that I was modest and I discover that I am vain.\" I wonder if you could chuckle? I hope so. I may shock many, I am afraid, when I say that as far as I can see, there is no reason why we should not learn to er1joy our vanity. You have read, no doubt, in many a book that vanity is an evil thing. Certainly it is evil when we are lost in it, when we take it seriously. The egos of people cause great trouble. But if we do not take it seriously, can we not laugh over our vanities and e4joy them? Would it be wrong to sit before the mirror and say, \"O you handsome lad,\" or \"O you lovely girl?\" That is vanity, and yet is it really any different from love? My daughter recently visited my sister for the first time in several years. My sister spent a great deal of time later telling me how wonderful my daughter was and how charmed she was with her personality, her speech, her appearance, etc. I listened and agreed, saying she had understated it badly. I told my daughter about the wonderful impression she had made on her aunt. She telephoned me about an hour later and said, \"Mother, please tell me all over again!\" I said, \"Wasn't one time enough?\" She replied, \"Twice won't be enough. It makes me feel wonderful to know that my Aunt Rosalee felt that way.\" So I told her again. I was catering to her vanity. But I did not hurt her one bit. I gave her that much more feeling of being loved, trusted, appreciated. She will bend every effort now to be that much more charming. Together we laughed about vanity, and this is the important thing. It is the self-deception that matters, not the conscious and open understanding of vanity. Actually, vanity is really a personality expression when it is conscious vanity of Self knowing of the Self, knowing that it is absolutely beautiful, wonderful, and perfect. Did that ever occur to you? Consider that the Self knows itself to be love incarnate, creativity, unity and beauty. The personality is its child and instrument, being grown by the Self. Therefore, with a trait like vanity, you can see that something that is true is coming down in warped ways until it becomes consciousl then you begin to learn to love yourself, and loving yourself is one of the secrets of awakening. That is what we are learning how to do, but you do not really love yourself until you know yourself, until you are honest with yourself, until you come out of your tower. Love yourself with reality, not with false notions; that is the secret of it all."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 43 TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 16, THE TOWER The color of this path for Key 16 is scarlet red. Permeate yourself and your aura through and through with red. Picture yourself in the tower with the two flrgures that represent your conscious and your subconscious mind. Picture yourself as hearing a roaring thunder crashing out across the sky like the thunder god. It is the sign of grace that you can hear. Picture the lightning as flashing down from the sun, demolishing the false crown of identification with the personality, of personal self-will, demolishing the false crown so that the light of Divine Will can shine through. Picture the flames shooting through the whole tower and through you, cleansing you of the old and permeating you with a vital livingness, transmuting the old and the unreal, the dream. Picture the light from the tip of the lightning bolt coming down into and through you like gold. As it comes through you, feel that you are awakening from a dream. Then levitate yourself from the tower. The false ideas are being thrown out; the false self-conscious and subconscious thinking. Picture yourself as levitating from the tower, now without a top; come down into the sun, still pervaded with the golden light that will help you henceforth to walk with self-honesty in the grace of God. During periods in which you are not sure whether or not you are deluding yourself about something, try this technique before retiring. Do not, be over-anxious, Hold the idea in mind of wanting to know whether or not you are deluded. Then go to sleep or about your business. You will find, if you work with it properly, that something will occur. Your own consciousness will open up, and you will see the situation more clearly; you will receive aid. Awakening is the keynote of Key 16. Walk with the realization that the Higher Self is in absolute charge. You do not have to be afraid to look directly at your personality. You do not have to worry about what it senses or feels or does, All babies grow up. The important thing is to let yourself grow, and to stop binding yourself with the false towers. Hold that thought in your consciousness and walk with God. AFFIR}{ATION: \"O Creator of us all, I beg Thy Grace that Thou reveal to me the truth, open to me the true vision, that I may become a true instrument of Thee. Destroy whatever old patterns of thinking and feeling I have had in the past which are not in accordance with Thy reality. Awaken me from this dream of unrealities and let me abide in Thy Light.\""}]
