[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 29 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In order to understand the universal nature of the sense of touch on the physical plane, we must first consider its function on the Inner Planes. The curious thing is that touch works on the Inner Planes at all times, though we are not outwardly and consciously aware of it! You will remember that in discussing the High Priestess, we spoke about the substance that we all share, that permeates us all. We mentioned that everything that is thought and felt pours out through this substance at all times and is being absor6ed by us continually. Also, everything we think and feel pours out from us and is absorbed by others--those close to us and even to people we have never known who might well be on the other side of the earth. They receive because they happen to be tuned into that vibrational range. Such transmission and reception are usually most intense in the areas of our conscious relationships, but not always, Through clairsentience, we have touch with what we call the world soul, Every time you have felt that you know how someone else felt you have a small degree of clairsentience, though you may not have experienced it with clarity. When you touch a table you feel something hard. When you put your hand over a fire you feel warmth. Clairsentience is just as definitely a sense of touch, if not more so but because we do not realize this we ascribe the feeling to indefinite things. I happen to be an extreme clairsentient. I am actually aware of the flow of substance with its emotional content as definitely as you are aware of feeling water flow over your hands when you hold them under a faucet. To give you some idea of what this sensation is I ask you to imagine that instead of turning on the faucet and feeling it on your hand, you feel the stream of water not just on your body but going through your heart or your brain, passing into and through every atom of your being in the same way, This is a very close analogr to what clairsentience is, one of the best we can give you because the experience is fluidic. Curiously enough, it is one of the easiest supersensory experiences to explain because all of our senses are really developments from that one primal and basic sense. Being an extreme clairsentient is both fortunate and unfortunate. Dr. Case said that I was the most sensitive clairsentient he had ever known. He felt very sorry for me because this sensitivity carried with it a penalty and yet it is a sacrifice that certain vehicles have to make. The reason that I can reach out in the subconscious level and touch you and therefore bring out the things you need to hear is because of this sensitivity, but this is not a one-way street. All emotion is reciprocal, therefore, I am open to thoughts and emotions from outside, some of which are beautiful and some of which are more painful than I could begin to describe. The vehicle of someone whose destiny is, for whatever reason, to be a channel, takes on a heavy burden in the use of the clairsentient faculty as a primary necessity for channeling and must have great strength not to crumble under it, This quality has its ecstatic and rapturous side as well as the opposite. It forces the disciple to keep reaching far more desperately for the Higher than one would ordinarily be driven to do, in trying to keep above the levels of pain."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORYPOWERS: 29 The reason I tell you this is because, in some degree, all of you have this facultSr but you do not realize what impinges upon you and flows from you as I do. It is much *or\" intense for me, of course, and yet it is part of what is essential. It is one of the reasons the One Self in Key 9 is shown above the level of the usual personality and emotions. Having this faculty of extreme clairsentience is essential for the channeling of certain kinds of energies, and I will explain to you how it works. I had experiences of receiving and projecting this supersensory awareness with someone even before I came to B.O.TA. and Dr. Case. I want to convey to you some of the other elements that are important for use of this quality. It can be developed if you use the principles of Key 9. This power can do wonders because it is supersensory power, but you need to have developed a good degree of the previous Tarot Key 8, Strength, so that yoq can withstand the impact of the world soul at the time it comes. If I were clairsentient ail the time, I should be dead! No one can be that way all the time; the quality ebbs and swells. I am always clairsentient when lecturing and writing because no matter what my personal life is, when I enter into the Temple to teach either verbally or through the rvr.itten word my personali[r is put aside. I instantly become aware of the inflow of this force, this love--the radiations from the lantern in the hands of the Hermit, flowing through me to you. Many have come to me from time to time and told me they have felt this flow. With.ori\", reception has been consciously deliberate; with others, superconsciously deliberate. It flows to all of you wherever you are because of the tremendous force that we channel here. I want to show you just what the faculty of clairsentience involves. If you are not too clairsentient. in a wa)r you will be better ofT becarrse it can bring much pain. I\\{;r olvn organism is tremendously sensitive in the feeling area because of the work that I must do. But that does not mean that you could not reach even higher levels than I. You must not look up to any teacher as being anything evolved beyond humanity. The one who learns the most in teaching is the teacher. Any teacher who tries to indoctrinate you into worshipping him is not a true teacher! If you receive spiritual riches from the teacher, you will automatically love the teacher and this is always good, but no true spiritual leader will rob you of your own right to grow, to make your own mistakes. No true teacher will tell you how to live your life, what to do and what not to do. You will be subjected to principles. You will be given love. You will be charged with spiritual energies. Your life will be enriched. Then you will really be traveling the Path of Return rather than going around in circles. You can achieve the very highest levels through our work, but not by the grace of any one individual; by the grace of God and the hierarchy; by the grace of serving as instruments and participants. I wish to give you a few examples to show how this faculty works and can work. About 11:30 one Sunday night, I was with Dr. Case when I became aware of a B.O.T.A. member who lived in a distant part of the city calling out for help. I was aware of this clairsentiently, for this is the manner my extrasensory perception manifests, more often than not; it comes only when the Higher Self decides. It always comes when I am engaged in spiritual work, but at other times it comes and goes. In this instance I became aware of a great wave of despair emanating from this individual. I had not met her but only seen her in the class and she had come to only a few of Dr. Case classes. I turned to Dr. Case and said, \"This member,\" naming her, \"is in desperate trouble; I want to see if I can give her"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 29 help; if I can pour some love substance to her.\" Dr. Case used to tease me about this way of phrasing what I did, but it seemed to describe it. At that time I had, for several years, the power to throw myself at will into a state of rapture with the Higher Self with the feeling of the Hermit . . . I relaxed and threw myself into that state of rapture, of rapturous identity with all life. As I did this I felt immediately an influx of fluidic love substance. This is the clairsentient awareness of the love that is the heart of the universe. I held a mental picture of our member with me in this love substance. Then my whole being relaxed and I knew that she was all right. It took about ten minutes. Four days later we were guests at another member's home. The member whose call I had heard was also present. She said, \"The most amazing thing happened. Last Sunday night at 11:00 I was in such despair that I decided to commit suicide. I went to turn on the gas and to get some sleeping pills, for I felt that combination would probably do it. Then, for some reason I don't understand, I called aloud, 'Ann, help me!' Suddenly the most extraordinary thing occurred. I felt the fluidic influx of love and peace and serenity --and it held me. I have been psychic all my life but I have never felt anything like this before. It filled me with strength so that I knew that whatever I had to go through I would be all right. I lost all desire for suieide.\" Dr. Case was beside me as she told this, as he had been when I received her call, and he verified the experience and told it to various people who were close to us. Our Grand Prolocutor has been present when Dr. Case has told this story. Something similar happened at another time. A man came purely by chance into the office. Instantly I felt his agony in my own heart. I knew I was receiving it from him, and so without saying anything I started to chat with him. I did the same things for him that I had done for our member. Without saying a word he left. About a week later he returned andsaid, \"Icamebacktoaskyouwhatyoudidtome?\" Isaid, \"Why?\" Hesaid, \"AfterI left I felt as though I were floating on air and a substance of love and ecstasy. It was marvelous. What in the world did you do to me?\" I said, \"Nothing much. Just a treatment from the Higher Self and you were receptive.\" He had been in despair, too. His wife had just left him and taken their two children whom he adored, and he was in a rejected state. That is the love side I have told you. There is another side. There are times that one feels enmity or hatred rushing in. If I felt that all of the time, it would be unbearable, of course. I have been in the presence of people who emanated hate. Inasmuch as I love people, I think that most of us feel love, but there is a principle of evolution involved. Jesus loved humanity, but there were people who hated him. Sometimes if you love you inspire vicious hatred by loving. You know the old saw, \"Love your enemies; it will drive them crazy!\" Unfortunately there are those on a certain level who react to love in an adverse way and experiencing this is a crucifixion beyond description if one is clairsentient. You need not be in their presence--this has nothing to do with it. I was not in the same house as our member when she experienced the love I sent her. Anyone who is serving the Light (and this is true of you, for as aspirants you are working to serve the Light), anyone who is serving the light is from time to time inevitably going to cause adverse reactions in some people. Anyone who seems to be higher or more advanced on the Path of Return is"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 29 automatically going to inspire envy, jealousy, a need to tear down and hurt. This is spontaneous in the souls of those on a lower level. Sometimes one side of a person may be very well evolved, but another side of him or her may not be, and so the feeling of desire, of eDvy, or the desire to hurt emerges: \"I wish so-and-so would drop dead!\" When a person is clairsentient, he picks that up. Not very long ago, to my horror and amazement, a woman developed such an envy and jealousy toward me (although she also had a beautiful side to her nature), and had a passion so strong that she was actually and literally wishing me dead. Consciously she deceived herself about it. I was in tremendous psychic agony. These emotions and feelings came at me like daggers. Imagine a stream of water from a shower that did not stop when it struck you on the skin but went through it like a torrent. That is what is often called psychic attack. It is not necessarily a conscious thing; people can unconsciously attack you psychically, and we can sometimes unconsciously attack others psychically, but the higher we go on the Path the less we can afford to attack anyone, even unconsciously. These forces are real things and strong on the inner plane. Those who are clairsentient come to know this more and more. I suppose most of you have read about the healing of my little dog, Tzaddi, though I did not give the full story in our little leaflet, Actually I went into the state of experiencing the all pervading, permeating cosmic love substance, holding my little dog on my chest with her head on my neck, feeling her warmth. I held her in that complete permeation with me, in that all embracing One and One alone, feeling cosmic love, and fell asleep that way\" When she and I awoke the tumor was gone. It was an instant disappeara:rce cf a very large tumor. This substance is a healing thing, in a physical way as well as in spiritual and emotional ways. The Hermit stands on snow. On the higher levels, it is the melting of that snow that feeds the whole universe with substance. The water of the High Priestess, the water of the Empress and Emperor and of the Chariot is all from that snow. This same substance, if we hate, if we condemn, takes on the quality of those emotions--and those who are clairsentient feel it. Very often we pick up all sorts of emotions that do not belong to us because we are not keeping our heights, or identity up there with the Hermit. What we must do is train ourselves to keep as much as possible only the positive flows, realizing that in the consciousness of that which is the True Self, our real identity, nothing is hidden. It knows all. There is no such thing as a secret thought. We must try to develop in ourselves the most positive flow that we can, no matter what others may be doing, no matter what others may be saying. On the other hand, we need to learn how to protect ourselves, but that knowledge we will give you with the appropriate Tarot key. The Tarot key we discussed in the last lesson is a great help with this. If you permeate yourself with Strength, it will help make you less aware of waves of undesirable emotions, We must understand the universe in which we live, and our consciousness, and the powers of our consciousness, so that we can use them as we are meant to use them and thereby help the rest of humanity. They are not separate from us, no matter on what level they are expressing."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 29 5 TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 9. THE HERMIT Here is the technique for using Key 9, which is simple but potent. The color of this path is yellow-green. Permeate yourself with this as you have done with the others. Picture it as a flowing, brilliant, vivid, green-gold light, flowing through your being and all around you. Use it most when you feel a conflict as to what to do, when you are not sure of what you should or should not do, when you are feeling very unsure of yourself or lonely. Use it until you have achieved conscious identity with the Self. Think of the Hermit as being that One Identity . . . as being the hand that fashions the universe and you, and that you, in turn, are the hand of God. Try to grow that idea in your consciousness in relation to this key. Then picture the light of His lantern, remembering that it is a six-rayed star which is a very potent s5rmbol indeed, and one used in many esoteric rituals. Picture this figure, the Hermit, as being your true identity, who knows everything you have ever been or done. He is watching over you, The light of his lantern is pouring into and permeating you with compassion and guidance. See it as a fluid, a golden fluid, pouring all through you from the six-rayed star. You will be amazed at how your conflicts will subside. Often we do not know what to do. When we go ahead feeling ourselves under guidance we do the best that we know, realizing that whether we consciously know it or not, we are under guidance. Summarizing the chief points to rememher in relation to Key 9, in essence, the light from the lantern is really the light of unity and love, that in it you live and move and have your being, that all of us do. We are, have been and will always be under the compassionate, watchful direction of this One Identity. No matter how things look that Identity is your \"f.\" You have never been lost though you may have thought you were, The One Self has always been with you. Reach for that realization, that union, and know that you are the most astonishing and miraculous consciousness that could be. You are a conscious part of the Total Identity and can never be anything else, no matter how evil you have been. You are that glorious Identity . You have been through every evil thing in order to become aware of who and what you are in self-experience. Never let yourself feel alone again because you are not. We wish again to remind you that, inasmuch as everSrthing that you feel and think is broadcast and some people pick it up consciously, remember to pour out as much love as possible to aid in the evolution of humanit;i because humanity at the present time is in a desperate plight. AFFIRMATION: I am one with the One and One alone. The conflicts, hurts and sorrows that I have experienced in the past are but the shadow play of ignorance. As I climb ever nearer to the height upon which the Hermit stands, I become ever mote conscious of my True Identity--my True Self."}]
