[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 49 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class lectures We speak of Beauty in connection with Key 19, because Qabalistically the Sphere of the Sun on the Tree of Life is Beauty, Tiphareth. The ideas of Beauty, which we related to you in our lessons on Key 18 were a preparation for this Key. We told you that one of the sins you continually commit against yourself, therefore, against all of life, is that you usually hate your own body or something about yourself. Those who have blue eyes wish they were brown; the tall wish to be short; the blond wish to be brunette; the fat wish to be thin. We are forever throwing criticisms into our subconsciousness and hating our bodies. Those who have become accustomed to the Eastern literature fall into the trap of thinking that any interestin or joyous response to the material and physical side of life is somehow unspiritual. They think that in order to be spiritual they must give up physical pleasures and forms. This is saying that the physical is ugly. After all, since God is the creator of all, including expressions that we experience as the physieal, are we not in a sense talking against God if we deride and disparage the physical world? The gross materialist is just as mistaken. He says that the physical is all that there is. Such a person will have some sharp lessons in incarnations to come until he learns better. The whole tradition of the Qabalistic school is to consciously bring spirit in and through the physical. The physical plane is a spiritual fact to the Qabalist and this is important to remember. The physical plane is a spiritual fact; it is not an illusion or delusion. We are deluded if we think that the physical is all that there is. We are deluded because we misinterpret what we see. This is because our consciousness has not yet learned to look and interpret correctly. Remember, we are not limited to having consciousness only in and through the physical, yet the physical plane is a spiritual fact. Otherwise, we would have to say God created something that is not a part of His own being. Everything created comes from the spiritual Sun, our true Father and our true Mother. Both wavy rays and straight rays emanate from the Sun in Key 19. Whenever you see wavy rays or anything curved it symbolizes the female aspeet. The straight ray symbolizes the male aspect. You are told by the shape of these rays that the consciousness behind the spiritual Sun is really both masculine and feminine, and that masculine and feminine are in union through love. This union produces offspring made in Its own image and likeness. It is symbolized by the little boy and girl in their magic fairy ring. Notice that the Yods hang six on one side and six on the other, with the 13th between. This tells a story that will be part of our technique. I want to remind you that the Sephirah on the Tree of Life that we told you is assigned to Christ Consciousness, to Beaut5r, to the Redeemer, to the sphere of activity of the Sun, has another name as well: Adam. Adam means generic humanity, not a man. Therefore we see here symbolically represented something that is of the utmost importance for us, not only to know but to practice knowing every moment of our lives. That is, that basically, we human beings are consciously the goal of the evolution brought about by the action of what in the physical outer world appears to be the ball of fire that we call the Sun."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 49 How do we arrive at that? Qabalistically, interrelations and associations give us this concept, but the idea came to me by direct experience. Practically every great mystic who has had awareness of the higher levels of consciousness has expressed and described an experience of permeation by light, of everything permeated with light, and certainly the Sun is the most extreme symbol of light that we can imagine\" When we realize that even in our very atoms, if we were relative to the atom in size as we are relative to the Sun, we would see something intensely brilliant, something very bright\" We are really composed of light. Mystics experience this light, for we are bathed in it. We are grown in it. When we achieve higher levels of awareness, we know ourselves to be a living, conscious part of this all-pervading light. Human evolution, of course, is not complete yet; this you realize. In a lesson in one of your earlier courses, Dr. Case mentions that this particular Tarot Key, in a sense, expresses homo spiritualis rather than homo sapiens, But, homo sapiens is evolving and being grown into homo spiritualis by the activity and enerry of the Sun, as all things are being grown by the energ/ and activity of this light, this warmth, this love. For love is truly what we must learn to see the Sun as, and nothing that interprets that extraordinary creative activity as anything except love can begin to reach the vital consciousness that we seek. That is why the sun center near the heart is aware of love, Through this center you can experience love in the form of waves. Remember, we are all attached in a strange way to the solar sea of love, just as the umbilical cord attaches the embryo to the mother, although the analory is not exact. We have a center, a vortex, within ourselves, through which we are aware of this love, so that not a single human being, no matter how alone he may think himself to be, no matter how desperate or hurt, is really without love, if only he could know it. We must remember to know this, and by knowing it begin to attract better outer conditions\" That which we become inside expresses itself outside; it has to. Every habitual thought and emotion must manifest, and the reason that there are so many failures in elementary metaphysics, when attempts are made to demonstrate various things, is because so many do not work at becoming the thing that they want. They want love, but if they have not become love, in its deepest sense, how can they have it? They cannot really give it, so they are unconscious of receiving it, and we must become conscious of receiving it in order to believe that we are lovable. People do not think of themselves as being really lovable; they think that such a belief is vanit5r, or egomania. This is not the way in which such negative aspects manifest. Those who are egotistical and vain do not really think that they are lovable, they subconsciously feel that they are not. Similarly people who have to talk about how upright they are, or how honest and responsible are trying to convince others of something they themselves doubt. When you are a thing, you simply are. The fact that they have to talk about a quality shows that they are trying to prove its existence to themselves or to others. These waves of love are made up of particles. It is interesting that these particles, and also light in its motion, behave somewhat like a liquid in that they seem to move as waves, but on the other hand they are also particles. Enerry manifests as waves and particles at once. It has a double type of apparent motion or expression; at least this is the way that we experience these elements with the kind of instruments that we use and the kind of consciousness we have with which to interpret them."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 49 3 Those who become truly aware on the supersensory levels, who develop a real sense of touch with the higher source of our being, which is in turn an expression for the Universal Source, feel this motion. The experience of waves of emotion is not really so strange as it may sound. Many people experience them, especially those who become sensitized through occult meditatioh and work with the Tarot. Sometimes people feel surges of fear washing through them like cold waves of brine. It is the same emotional energy being expressed in an apparently negative fashion. Many, when in love, have felt waves of love. Perhaps you have nevet experienced it in that way, but the whole reproductive drive for union involves this wave-like electro- magnetic enerry, Remember that fertility and sterility, represented by this Key, are linked with reproduction. The creativeness of the Sun is our earthly all. Though this awareness of the wave aspect of certain emotions is not so unusual, what is unusual is to become aware of it in a more or less continuous fashion, as something that comes often. That is my good fortune. I have this continuous awareness and have had it for a long time. When I first came into Tarot and Qabalah, I had a very wonderful experience in relation to the Sun, an experience that brought with it the realization of the wave-like emotion that is involved in its love aspect. At that time, I thought astrolory nonsense, Nevertheless I decided to investigate it and see whether or not there was anything correct in its claims. Shortly after I did this, having already been stimulated by Tarot s5rmbolism and therefore stirred to deeper areas of awareness, I had an experience in which I saw inwardly far beyond the usual level of clairvoyant seeing. I saw in this deeper knowing the Sun traveling through the various signs of the zodiac. I saw that when I called myself a Scorpion, and another a Cancerian, and another a Piscean, all that I was saying was that the same Sun happened to be in different relationships to the earth, with different speciflrc slants of its rays, but that it was not a different Sun. In esoteric astrologr, it is said that the placing of the Sun indicates the basic individuality, yet in this experience, I saw that our basic individuality comes about, not because we have different Suns, for it is the same Sun, but because the slant of the rays of that Sun has certain distinct colorations from its motion, and hence your \"I\" and my \"I\" seem to differ. They are not really different. We are each a ray, a specialization, a marvelous specialization of the Central Consciousness which we call the Sun. This specialized consciousness is eternal and is never lost. Why is this? Because we are offspring of the Sun. It is because we have the same power as the Sun, being its offspring. The difference is only that we have it in lesser measure at this point in our evolution. Our consciousness is the way in which the central Sun experiences specialized types of consciousness under the conditions of the magic ring in which the children dance. It is the way in which the Sun experiences the form side of life because it is the kind of form that we have that determines the kind of consciousness we express. Even when we drop the physical form, we still have an astral form; we still have a mental form, and we are individualized beings. We are children of the Sun. We are begotten of the Sun of light and love. Therefore, it is not only that we are fed !y the Sun, we also feed the Sun by the kind of consciousness and attitudes and reactions that we have,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 49 since they are both our's and the Sun's at the same time. How could it be otherwise, since we are a tay of that Sun? Therefore, the motion of love is not a one-way motion. Only through man, homo spiritualis, can the full mutual loving come into being, the realization of unity, the awareness of processes. Therefore, the continuous expansion into ever greater areas of mastery can come about only through that reciprocal and mutual flow, the electro-magnetic connection between two poles. In the same way, we have an intereonnection with the Sun because we are a very special kind of instrument. Human consciousness is a special instrument that brings back to full power dissipated energr that has traveled a long distance. Human consciousness is like an amplifier for solar consciousness. Solar consciousness is both our mother and our father and is a direct aspect and in conscious union with the whole and complete Universal Source. It is one of the many Suns and Sons of the whole. We are vitally important, Through our consciousness the whole creative eners/ becomes consciously creative, so that we can think of something that we want and create and work toward it. Some of the things that we create and work towards are quite imperfect, but that is because we have not yet learned how to create as beautifully as we will later on. Not only is this your destiny, but you are even now, through your heart center, in perfect connection with the Sun. This is what I saw in the supersensory experience I had of the significance of human beings\" I saw the oneness of the basic source, as well as the eternal elements involved in the individualizations that we are. I saw the one and the many at the same time. I realized that the secret of truly attaining to the estate of homo spiritualis is in learning how to point the heart as well as the mind towards what this estate really is. Even if we do not know it or believe it, we should nevertheless practice it and by practicing it finally come to the condition in which the experience is verified. In that experience I also realized that we have to work with each other and help each other through the love waves. Those who have learned how to become more intensive amplifiers must then amplify those waves and transmit them to the rest of the planet in order to intensify the development toward which the Sun is working in and through us who are part of Itself. You are not an isolated body separated from either your source, the local Sun, or the Universal Source. You're being immersed continuously in the fluid, the life blood of the Universal Consciousness through the particles that flow through you continuously, thousands per second. You are bathed in the life of God. You exist inside the Vast Being. The Sun is not something in the heavens. As far as its rays extend, that is part of its being. You are notjust your skeleton; you are also the attenuated parts ofyour body, the flesh that is made up of such a large portion of water. The Sun is not just that which we see in the heavens with our physical eyes. Were it, how could we experience sunshine? We live in the Sun and are an extraordinarily highly evolved aspect of the Sun. Our destiny is beyond anything that you could believe at this point. Since it is the Sun that built your body, since it is the Sun that gives you all this creative enerry, since it is the Sun that nurtures you, with other Suns helping in their ways, should you not decide to act like a child of the Sun, and stop walking with your eyes upon the ground alone? When we do look on the ground, let us remember that this ground is also the magic of light."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 49 Your form is a miracle. Your consciousness is beyond anythingthat can be explained. You have it because you are a child of God and even more than that. You must awaken your heart center so that you can become aware of the flow of love that comes unceasingly to you. If it were not there, you could not live and grow. You may have read of the experiments in which plants grew poorly when cursed and vigorously when blessed. No matter how many curse you, there is one source that blesses you always, no matter what you have been or done. You are connected with the Sun, as a ray of the Sun, through your heart center, the Sun that is the core of your individuality and your eternal being. You are, therefore, immersed in the love of God; it is your obligation to begin really to love God, and you do not really love God if you do not love God's other children and other creations. In the technique that follows begin trying to feel love and gratitude toward the Lord of Light and Life for the wonder and miracle and privilege of having consciousness and awareness and experience and growth. Let this feeling pour out from your heart in a wave, Let it pour from your heart in terms of both the little girl and the little boy who symbolize self-consciousness and subconsciousness. Let it pour upward to the Sun and permeate the Sun in a beautiful orange glow like sunset. When you become proficient in this technique, you can use it to promote the feeling of being the magical, wondrous child of the Sun. Think of your body and individuality as really being the magic fairy ring. You can learn how to heighten the feeling by consciously and deliberately trying to feel the rays from the Sun coming down to permeate your heart and then sweeping back to the Sun. Working with this Tarot Key may develop in you the a'wareness of love waves coming to you from everywhereness. You will experience great and lovely sensations from the wave substance that pours right into the heart. We are trying to help you to become aware of this love enerry, which permeates all things. It can express itself only through instruments. The more developed our love nature becomes, the better instruments we become. TECHNISUE FOR TAROT KHy NO. 19JHE SUN The color of this path, Key 19, is orange. Immerse yourself and your aura through and through with the color orange for two feet around you in all directions. Picture yourself as being in the inner ring, a little behind the children, so that you have them in your field of vision mentally. As you stand with the children in the magic ring, raise your arms toward the Sun and send up a call to the Source of your being, to the Source of all being, to bring light to your subconsciousness. \"Oh, Thou, who art the Sun of Light and Life, who liveth me and all beings, who loveth through my heart and thinketh through my brain, send Thy ray of Love and awakening to my subconsciousness, so that it will be my eternal partner as we grow together towards Thy stature.\" Now have a golden wavy ray of light from the Sun flow down and immerse the figure of the little girl, permeating her with Love and Light. Raise your arms toward the Sun again and send out a second call on behalf of your self-conscious mind: \"I pray Thee to make me every day more conscious and aware of Thee as being my eternal immortal Selfhood. Help my eyes to see Thee in Thy true garb, my ears to hear Thee in the true melody of life, my touch to feel Thee in all thy expressions.\" Let a golden straight ray of light from the Sun flow down and immerse the figure of the little boy, permeating him with light and love."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 49 Now mentally look at the orange Yod between the girl and boy. Let the golden light from the Sun stream down in one beam to activate this central Yod. Have it spread out, greatly extended in a halo of light encompassing the boy and girl. Let the orange light stream into them through their heads from the points on either end of the Yod. Next, let the Light pour itself into your heart center, which is slightly above the physical heart, Raise your arms a third time and send the Love and Light that have filled you to capacit5r out into all of life. You send it up and out to make room for more. AFFIRMATION: \"Oh, Sun of Life and Light, I send out to you and to all of life, the Love that you give so freely. I am permeated with your light, I am permeated with your love. Through my personality, a ray of Thy Greater Self, I continuously radiate Love into Life, blessing every form, every center, every expression of Thy eternal creativity.\""}]
