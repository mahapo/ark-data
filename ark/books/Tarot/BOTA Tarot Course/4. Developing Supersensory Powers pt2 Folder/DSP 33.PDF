[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC D(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVEI,OP SUPEN,SENSORY POWERS LESSON 33 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures It is always diflicult to convey in words experiences of spiritual illumination, Words are only a bridge. I want you to receive the true feeling of this experience, the spirit of it. I want something within you to rise up and see it from within. Even that perception lasts for only a fraction of a second. I want you to grasp this principle. After that, understanding will grow of itself. We must work to help you to receive the spirit of what I perceived. When I say \"perceived,\" I do not mean that I saw an5rthing with the physical eye or clairvoyantly; it was something far higher than that. What I received wae the opening up of the whole principle of justice. I had a complete perception and recognition ofjustice far beyond anything that I can describe. I had been working with Key 11 for some time; but I still had periods of feeling sorry for myself because of being handicapped from the illness I had at twenty-one. I still had periods of feeling imprisoned, limited and kept from doing all the many things I wanted to do. At that time I still felt depression at times from some hurt that would come up into my' heart, or the memory of a betrayal or a loss. These reactions to memories of hurt are the thinp that the techniques for using this key will help you expel permanently. My experience did not come about while I was actually meditating on Key 11; experiences of this tSrpe almost never do. They will come at the most curious moments, sometimes even at embamassing times, but it is the basic work of the meditation on a key that gradually opens the door. I had been reflecting on the ideas ofjustice and karma and of aciion and reaction and of the goai. I had wanted to understand the meaning ofjusiice. Suddenly ablaze of light enveloped my mind and soul, and as it brightened I realized that in the tableau above this Tarot key stood the Emperor. I could see the Emperor as representing the ruler, God. Vision is the sense assigned to the Emperor, true vision. It was this true vision that sees beyond the surface appearances that opened up to me. I saw that every bit of pain that had ever been suffered by any human or creature has been the \"goad,\" the ox-goad that has kept motion going in order to evolve self-conscious centers for God's own Being, a goad not from something without but something within God. I saw very clearly that just as we must practice painful exercises if we wish to become ballet dancers or prize fighters, just as we put ourselves through deliberate pain in order to develop any ability, so pain is neither something that an uqjust God or something external inflicts on any other body. Pain happens inside the One Universe, inside the One God. There is nothing outside of God. Just as we may decide to put ourselves through a discipline that could be very painful, so does God. We do it; can we say that God is less than we? This is one of the points involved. It is within the substance of God and the experience of God that pain occurs; it is not external! We are all aspects within God. God never created anything external to Itself to suffer pain. God apparently had a good reason for the pain. The point as I saw it was that God seems to put great significance on the ultimate results of this deliberate self-compression, self-pain, goading of a portion of the primeval substance of ltself. God is working toward a special development."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPER,SENSORY POWER,S: 33 God apparently expands Its own capacities of creativeness through this procedure. This is as much a wonder and joy to the Higher Self, our true contact with God, as is the discipline that one follows to become a musician. The repetitive pounding on the piano, the compulsion to practice hold a certain joy. In this kind of discipline one looks forward to what practice is going to bring. The Higher Self knows this truth. Although, while the compression and pain is going on, there is tremendous concentration, so that we are not consciously aware of that part of our being, nevertheless it is there. It exists. Think of all life as being involved in this process, even the little creatures. For they, too, are an evolving part of the Divine. What do we mean when we say \"evolving?\" It is being kept in motion; it is conseiousness kept in motion, holding itself in a certain concentration that becomes what we call bodily incarnation. Between incarnations, there are other concentrations and pressures. All of these exercises develop the muscles of consciousness, This is a brief version of my experience. I could write a book on what I perceived and still not be able to tell it all. These fourth dimensional awarenesses carry so many implications that all one can do is to try to give the highlights or the spirit of them. Just think how much that concept answers for us. It makes us realize that our pain is God's pain, that there is no such thing as anyone inflicting pain on anyone else, as such, despite appearances, It makes us realize that every unhappy experience, whether it be physical, emotional, or mental, is part of the process of development that is necessary in bringing about our centers of self-consciousness, as conscious children of God, conscious of our superconscious powers and able to use them. When we realize that \"evil\" is not what it seems to be, that we see but a portion of the total process, we see that we must have enough faith to perceive the reasons for the process; this should become clear to you in this lesson. We must be able to say to ourselves, \"If the Divine finds it necessaryto send portions of Itself on the journey of action and reaction in order to bring about the birth of self-conscious beingness and individuality, of strength, it must be that this process is good.\" I dislike using that word \"good\" because we usually think in terms of the world's ideas of good, and this inner meaning is something far beyond the world's ideas of good; it is a far higher principle. We ordinarily think of good and evil only in our relative area of living, where we need such distinction to survive. The next aspect of the vision, a vital part of it, which I feel is of great importance for us to understand with our hearts and minds is what forms the basis of our karmic reactions. The secret of changing karma is going to be given to you now. Let me assure you that you cannot help creating karma. What you must understand, above all, is that you are creating it now. Whatever you did yesterday, is done; reaction has been set in motion. There is an equilibrium that must be established, and it automatically brings about this readjustment, in terms of understanding, of consciousness, of deepeningthe heart and soul. It is in the way that we teach ourselves to react to life today that we control karma! I mean today! What you put off until tomorrow is not today. It is now, this minute. Today is not only what makes tomorrow's karma, but what mitigates it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPEITSENSORY POWER.S: 33 Dr. Case's explanation goes something like this: When you throw a ball against a wall it will bounce back in accordance with the amount of force used to throw it. There is nothing keeping you, however, from running toward the ball and catching it halfway back. It will hit your hand a little harder, granted, but that is not important. You modiff the path of the ball's rebound, and by analogy, you can meet karmic reaction and modify it. This is the secret of altering karmic repercussions and making them different from what they were. A competent astrologer, given the necessary data, can predict quite aecurately for the average person. The more highly evolved you become, however, the less able is any astrologer to prognosticate for you. Hence, as an advanced student, you should not permit anyone to pour suggestions into your mind through astrological readings which supposedly predict what will happen to you. This is falling into the trap of receiving suggestions and reactions from the mass mind level of average humanity, An astrologer may tell you how the energies are going to play upon the evolved person, but he cannot tell what the effects of these energies will be because the evolved person does not react like the average man; he runs halfway toward the ball and catches it! We are always subject to the forces of the universe, but how we react to their influence alters their effect. An aspect that would ordinarily be frustrating, bringing very unhappy results, can be made to express in exactly the opposite way by our reactions. This is the secret of karma. Emotional reaction is the secret of transmutation of karma, but emotional reaction needs mental direction. You cannot have control without direction. I will give to you the most important point I wish to make in connection with karmic reactions in terms of what I saw. At the time I had this vision, I was in a continuous state of universal lovingness, which is one of the primary secrets of transmutation. I had been practicing loving. I had had a previous experience that made me realize how important it is to train oneself to pour out love instead of seeking to bring it in from outside as we usually do. The greatest joy is being able to love. Only a person in a state of love is happy. The only real ecstasy in life is in being in love, whether you love a piece of sky, a piece of music, a creature or a person. It is only when you are in that state, radiating your love, that you are in a really happy state, If God is love, then as part of God we must learn to feel the state of lovingness, rather than hunting for it. We must feel love for God through God's life in his creatures. I was in love even with the walls of my house. Having been in that state for a long time, I put myself through the discipline of making myself remember to send out love the moment I woke up. I used every Tarot key and every other Qabalistic technique to transfer this love into every experience. This was the nextrealization I had in the experience of Justice. I looked back into my life, a fantastic, difficult life, so strange that its events would seem untrue to most. I had much to feel sorrowful about, and when I looked back I saw that all of that hurt, pain and frustration had been the greatest blessing that ever came my way. Each and every sorrow had made it possible for me to deepen my cup of consciousness, deepen my capacity for emotion."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORYPOWER,S: 33 Certainly I carried the emotion negatively for a while, but that is essential at the beginning until one learns to carry it positively. Every pain deepens the cup, deepens the cafacity of th\" cup; the capacity to be conscious, to be aware. In this perception I was aware, with consciousness beyond anything I had had up to that point, of sharp intense beauty, of the significance of living. I saw it in terms of Justice. Justice is not at all what people think it is. Repudiate any notion that pain is the result of error. Pain is involved in error, yes, but everyone acts, thinks, and !9, in exact accordance with what he must be in that stage of his evolution. If two, three, a thousand incarnations ago, you killed 6omeone, you had to at that stage; you did not know any better; it was your lack of growth. Therefore, it is your lack of growth at any point or in any area that has made your actions inevitable, the actions that have the repercussions, the actions that bring growth. What we call \"evil\" serves the good even though it produces painful repercussions. I looked into this principle and saw it with a clarity beyond belief. I saw that whatever I had done in this incarnation, and whatever I had done that disquieted me, was what I had to do at that stage of understanding. I had no reason to castigate myself. I had no reason for self reproach, nor did anyone, really. We have all done what we have had to do at a given stage of o,g growth because we did not know any better and we could not know any better at that particular stage. This is a very important thing to understand, so that we may drop our feelings of guilt and thereby cease to bring upon ourselves unnecessary repercussions that we think of as washing out our karma. I was foolish enough to believe this at one time' When I reached a certain stage in aspiration and considered karma, I thought, \"I want to get it overl Iwanttogetoutofthis; bringiton! I€titroar. I'lltakeit!\" Literallyallhellbroke loose. It was not as I thought. All I did was to send out a call for extra punishment! I shouted to the universe the idea that karma is something that brings repercussions, and I got them. I saw then why certain later experiences had come; I saw that they had nothing to do with repercussions from error. We have all been so evil in our time that we might as well be comfortable with one another. There is nothingthat we have not done, Is it not wonderful that we have reached the point at which we are reaching for the divine understanding and seeking to use it? I saw that I had nothing to blame myself for, or anyone else. Those who had betrayed me had done all that they could do at that stage of their growth. They served as angels for me; they were the channels for the pain that grew me. They, too, would have pain which would grow them, In the final analysis no one had injured me at all. Nor does anyone ever injure anyone; this is what I saw. More than that; not only was it unnecessary for me to work at being noble by saying, \"I forgive you;\" there was no reason to forgive. We cannot blame ourselves for having pain in the heart, but we have to go beyond that. I saw that this concentration of hurt and pain had made it possible for me to be able to love to the degree that I was able to love at that moment, and my heart was lifted up into a heaven beyond description and it was right here. This world, this sky, these people; and my heart swept the earth with a feeling ofjoyousness as something in me called out, \"It was worth it; it was worth it!\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER.S: 33 This is what I want you to do: Look back at your life, your hurts, your rejections, the things you have done that you feel grrilty about, and the pain that you have received without deserving it. Look back at that and then look to your present moment, your present consciousness. Be able to say, \"I am aware; I can aspirel I can listen to a song; I can feel the breath of God in the breeze. I can listen to the song of heaven in the creatures and in the voices of people. This I can do; I can love. I CAN LOVE! What a miracle is that!\" and say, \"It was worth it!\" When you can say that you will have mitigated karma beyond description. When you can hold that feeling, you will be running toward the ball in ways you cannot begin to comprehend. Once you apprehend this, even intellectually, you must practice it over and over to make it a second part of your nature, to be able to say, \"ft was worth it.\" Even if it gives you nothing but the capacity to aspire, it will bre worth it. If it gave you the capacity to love, to let your heart lift to color and sound and movement, to be able to know how to be a friend, to have a friend, is not this a mirecle? Was it not worth pain? As eternal beings should we be upset by taking a few muscular exercises of the soul? This is the spirit we want you to practice having. I hope you consider the logic of it. This Tarot key presents that poise. We shall forever be at peace at the center if we reach this realization. We shall have upsets, but there will be a core at peace even under disturbing conditions. When you can say that, you will go into action even when you are not sure you are right. You will know the real meaning of \"I guide thee all the way, Rest thou in Me.\" That is the true rest in action. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEy NO. 11, JUSTICE This is the technique for Tarot Key 11 to develop ESP and power. The color of this path is green. Permeate yourself and your aura with emerald green. Bring the key into your consciousness as being above and slightly behind you. Picture yourself as backing into the key. You are standing in front of the figure, a much larger figure than yourself. The top of your head is at the level of the scale. This exercise is to be used to train yourself to develop discrimination and the ability to weigh and measure your own reactions and others'reactions to the various events in life. Thus, when you have to act in terms of others, you will have a better understanding of their motives and needs. Call upon the spirit of divine Justice to renew the discrimination that you require. Have the figure of Justice move, holding the sword over your head as it is held in the key. See a golden light streaming down from the handle of the sword through your whole body, especially your brain, holding in mind the fact that this develops your ability to diseriminate. Have the scales move over your head, image the scales as representingyour ability to properly gvaluate situations and people you meet. Have gold light pour down from the two cups of thei scales, bathingyour head and all the cells of your brain."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER.S: 33 Try to feel the idea, \"L,o, I guide thee all the way; rest thou in Me.\" Hold the feeling, the knowledge, the faith that as you do whatever it is you do, the guidance of the Higher is with you. This is the semet of obtaining peace in action as well as developing the higher faculties. The most important thing is to realize that you are not afraid of doing the wrong thing. You must remember that there is no such thing as doing the wrong thing. The wrong thing is the right thing. In the final analysis, can anything work against God, against evolution; God's plan? We do not say that a baby does the wrong thing when it makes messes learning to eat. Dare you look upon yourself in a worse light, show yourself less charity? You are an aspect of God. You are not being spiritual by taking care not to condemn others but tearing yourself apart. You yourself are your first responsibility to God; your feelings about yourself. You must repudiate feelinp of guilt. \"Consume not thy heart, \" said the ancient Egrptian. You must look upon failings in a different light; you must stop being afraid to act. Hold onto the guidance of the Higher and feel the peace of that guidance; but if you are not willing to walk how are you going to reach your goal? Act! It is better to do the \"wrong thing\" than to do nothing when you are not sure! He who leaves nothing to chance will do few things ill, but he will do very few things, By honest mistakes you learn discrimination and evolve in the process. AFFIRMATION: I feel the eternal presence of my Higher Self. Resting under the wings of His loving guidance, I am not afraid to act, Whether my actions bring pain or joy, they are for my progress. My joys and my sorrows evolve me toward conscious union with my true Self."}]
