[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 41 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures As long as our personalities see only partial pictures, by the laws of attraction and polarity, we have differentiations. Some of us do not like the color red and so will not feel comfortable in the company of those who make us react to red. If you think of each of us as being a different color, with infinite variations, and reflect that all of us do not like some colors, why should we be upset if someone does not happen to admire our particular color? There are so many other colors in the universe. Until the personality has become completely evolved as a full instrument for the Higher Self and the consciousness of humanity has achieved an adult level, we must make up our minds to the fact that we are going to live in a world in which human beings react to appearances in various ways. We are going to be thrown up against what we can call evil, because in a relative sense evil does exist. The Qabalistic method of attaining supersensory awareness and power does not attempt to deny that evil exists, as some schools of thought do. We do not deny evil. All you have to do to confirm this is to look out at the world. Some people are starving; some are trying to kill one another; some are inciting hatreds so that violence can be used. They all call their attitudes by beautiful names. They say that they are all on the side of good and must destroy evil. This has always been the way of human consciousness and will continue to be until it evolves to something higher. That is why you have often heard it said that the name of the devil is legion. It is separativeness, the lack of realization of the unity amongus all, despite the differences. That is the devil, whereas the name of God is the unity of all. The shadow that we are in is due to our concentrated separateness. Within our consciousness we have a sense of separation from the awareness of the actual unity of all beings, all life, all matter, the entire universe, the One Life. We are not aware of that unity through our senses, but our consciousness can be aware of it! Just as our consciousness is able to correct the apparent motion of the sun and of the train track, in the same way it can continuously correct the impression of separateness, of hate, of disaster, of slander. Slander is one of the primary names of this diabolic figure, and it is wel it is we because of our ignorance. Because human consciousness is still, on the whole, in the state of profound ignorance, it will act from that ignorance in self-conscious pride. One person says to another, \"f don't like you. Knock this chip off my shoulder,\" and they go at one another verbally or physically. We must recognize that such is the level of most. At the same time, we must remind ourselves that they do not act that way because they are really evil, because they are not. There is no such thing in the final analysis. They act that way because they are stumbling, self-hypnotized, conceited children who are screaming, \"Look at me! Look at me! See what I can do!\" Children do this, and we think as adults we do not. We do it more subtly, the slanderer becomes ever more subtle, the tempter. We have discussed the trials and temptations we go through in relation to the angel in order that the level of the soul, of the consciousness. mav be tested.

Qabalistically Key Lb is called the first stage of spiritual unfoldment. With it begins the third row of Tarot keys in the tableau. The first stage of spiritual unfoldment is hellish, the devil. Yet, this key gives us a profound message. Even though it appears to show a desperate situation, it must be viewed with the spirit of mirth. By now you see that we are not trying to do away with the personalit5r. We are not trying to destroy the personality. We are, however, trying to reach a conect perspective in our view of personality, this marvelous instrument which the life power and your Higher Self have grown\" However, the personality is an instrument only, not the Selfl One should not be emotionally involved with the instrument that he uses. Of course, some people are. They extend the feeling of their selfhood to the instruments of selfhood, and they become agitated if the instrument is not appreciated. Our perspective is usually the problem, and in this context our lack of proper perspective has to do with the eye as an organ of vision, the basic meaning of this key. We are trying to achieve the ability to weigh and measure relative values correctly. We are trying to learn to interpret properly the role and the place of our personaliby (and of other personalities) in the experience of our consciousness. We cannot do this so long as we take our personality and those of others too seriously, as we usually do. Of course, in one sense, we should take every personality seriously because it is a manifestation of the Divine. A flower is a personality, as well as a tree or a bird. Once I had taken some wood into the house, and a little inch worm was in with it. It inched itself along until it reached the edge of the stick where a knot stuck up. As I reached over, it became aware of me. It drew back to that knot and cringed! This is personalit5r expressing itself. It sensed danger. It felt danger and cringed, just as you and I would do. It had no idea that it need not be afraid of me. It was reacting in terms of its consciousness. I took it outside to freedom. When I say that we should not take the personality seriously, I must make clear what I mean, We should take all personalities seriously as manifestations of the Divine. There is nothing else. All are a particular expression, in one way or another, of the Divine Life, a given state of consciousness, and therefore of activity whatever that may mean to us at our stage. Not taking the personality seriously means not making the kind of identification we have just mentioned; identification that makes it so important to us to strut and peacock. This pompous exhibitionism is what some call the insanit5r of humanity, We feel we must protect our personalities. We identify ourselves so closely with our personalities that we lock ourselves in a prison of limitation and are unable to be aware of our larger self, When things become desperate, the bondage unbearable, the soul will begin to search for some way out, That is why, no matter how terrible the bondage, the final outcome has to be in terms of the good, the true and beautiful. They are a part of the process of unfolding. We must and will come to a point at which we have no need to react"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 41 continuously, no need to protect the personality from the evaluations of others, no need to be on guard. We need no longer ask, \"Did he mean this or that? Is this a slight? Am I not appreciated? Does this mean I am not loved?\" If you hunt for such responses you will find them. You will find everythingyou hunt for. The way to look at the personality with the proper perspective is with the same indulgent humor that we give to a child or a pet. This is the secret of overcoming many of our sorrows and bonds. People will begin to love you more. You cannot force people to love you! It does not work, so what is the use in trying? You only sink deeper into bondage and misery. But when you develop the ability to laugh at your own personality, to take it lightly, as a changing, transitory part of the infinite universe with which your Higher Self is working and enjoying, then the proper perspective comes! We become lost; even Jesus did. No matter how much awareness one attains, there are moments of lapses. Appearance does not change. It is our awareness and interpretations that change and give us a different world. There are times in which, even though we know, better we sink into despondency and sorrow, but we do not need to stay there. We can come up very fast. Even the Masters, when they are not functioning in their capacity as Masters, have to watch themselves. They have the same illusions that we do, but they know what to do about them. The secret lies in really understanding what the personality is, becoming aware of its little foibles\" When you really understand your own personality, you will also be able to better understand the personality traits of others, When you achieve a humorous attitude towards your foibles, you achieve the same indulgence toward others! You can do it only when you stop thinking that you are the personality! As we look deep into ourselves we recognize an inner core that is able to view personality objectively. This objectivity can look at personality dispassionately and appreciate what is mirth-provoking and what needs serious attention. This is the secret. That is why this key s5rmbolizes mirth, It takes true perspective to chuckle. Without perspective there is no mirth. People without a sense of humor do not understand what is really important and what is not. Perspective has to do with the eye, it has to do with being able to evaluate correctly, being able to appreciate the ridiculous in certain situations and respond as the situation indicates. We have been trying to make you smile at all the little foibles that belong to us all. We have been trying to help you do this by showing them to you in various ways. We need to develop the ability to do this all by ourselves. Suppose you looked in the mirror and decided that you look lovely tonight? Some of us do, and those of us who do not are miserable about it. Tonight let us feel that our personality is adorable and charming. Recognize that the personality is like a child or a pet, showing off and wanting to be petted and praised. We must pet it and praise it. What is wrong with petting and praising your personality if it is being charming? If you happen to be working at something and suddenly discover that you have mastered it, 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CT ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 41 what is wrong with saying, \"I am a genius!\" With laughter behind it, what is wrong with that? This is the secret of release from bondage, because you can do that only as you attain the advantage of perspective. You would love to say things like that about yourself, but you are afraid to because you have been taught that it is egotistical. The person who is egotistical is like the gentleman of whom I told you. He had no humor at all. Proper perspective sees when things are done well or not so well. There is nothing wrong with feeling pleasure in the things that your personality can do well. When you can love yourself and retain the light touch, it is not egotism. Egotism is taking yourself too seriously. What is the greatest bore in the world? The egotist who has to be forever telling others how important he is, who must be taken seriously at all times. Who are the people with whom others love to be? Those who make you like yourself. Does anyone ever make you like yourself unless he likes you? Is there ever a reciprocal liking without a mutual awareness of mirth, of the foolishness of the personality? Do not fear to cater to some of the needs of the personality as long as you do it consciously and with amusement. There is the difference; there is the control; there is the mirth. That is why this Tarot key is called the Renewing Intelligence. What renews us more than laughter? What makes our personalities go out and work with new livingness more than being filled with laughter? Mirth is the most wholesome thing in life\" Learn to laugh, to acceptyour personality, to indulge it, to scold it, to dramatizeit. You should scold it in the way that I used to scold my little dog. When she did something to be scolded for, I rvould bend down and shake rny finger and say, \"You naughty girl, you.\" People asked whether I rewarded her for good behavior also. Of course I did! In like manner, scold your personality but occasionally put in a little drop of love. In this way you will be able to be objective enough with it to let the transmuting essence work, and to make that personality something glorious and complete and whole.

Having filled yourself with blue violet, turn and face the Devil, Walk in back of the human fltgures so that you are in front of the Devil. Say to him, \"You fraud! You trickster! You father of lies!\" Let out your indignation, Levitate yourself to the level of the Devil's head and snatch the pentagram from it. The inverted pentagram is a symbol of evil. Snatch it from his head and reverse it\" The minute that you turn the pentagram right side up, it becomes the spirit that has dominion over the elements, over the father of lies, the traducer. It helps to free you of any feeling of being locked away\" Turn the pentagram until the point is in the middle on top. Then point the top toward the Devil and picture a light emanating from the pentagram. Have the Devil wear an expression of utter astonishment and alarm! Dramatize this. Have the Devil roused in flight from the half cube and chase him.
