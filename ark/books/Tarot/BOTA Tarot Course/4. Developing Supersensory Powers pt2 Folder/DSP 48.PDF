[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC U(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 48 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures The 19th Tarot Key represents s5rmbolically those aspects of being that we call the Sun. In the esoteric work of holy Qabalah, the sphere of activity of the Sun is at the very center of the Tree of Life; it is that which is the giver of life to the personality; it is the image-making power of consciousness; it is that which is called Beauty; that which is called Christ Consciousness, and that which is called the Redeemer, the Savior. The symbolic aspects of this Key, in terms of Qabalah, make it one of the most effective tools you can use to help overcome a despondent or depressive attitude towards life. This Key, together with Tarot Key 0, the Fool, if worked with regularly and with concentration, will inevitably overcome depression. You will understand why, if you do not know already, before you have finished these lessons. To understand the message and the function of Key 19, we must consider a few of the Qabalistic interpretations of the name of the Key and the Hebrew letter assigned to it. Resh, the Hebrew letter means \"head\" and by \"head\" we mean the area above the neck. The meaning of the letter associated with the last Tarot Key we discussed, Key 18, was \"back of the head.\" With Key 18, the Moon, we were dealing with subconsciousness and the processes that have to do with evolution on the Path of Return. With Key 19, we are concerned with the head as a whole, with the countenance. Indeed, this is intimately connected with what, in Qabalah, is called the Vast Countenance, the very first emanations from behind the Three Negative Veils of the Absolute. The Vast Countenance is the term that indicates that whatever we maJZ see or rvhatever Sun may be ours. is a conscious being. One cannot think of countenance without thinking of consciousness. The attribution of head tells us in the shorthand language of symbolism that, in actuality, what we see as the physical Sun in our heaven is really a living consciousness, even though to our sensory perceptions it is a physical form which we interpret in another way. Other forms of life might well interpret us rather differently. We describe this scientifically as a mass having a vast amount of hydrogen atoms and a much smaller percentage of other atoms, very small indeed. We say that the atoms of the Sun, being held by gravity under gteat pressure and heat, explode themselves and emanate the results of these explosions as eners/ of various kinds. Thus, we are accustomed to hearing interpretations and descriptions of the physical Sun that merely describe a certain outward process of which our senses are aware, and which our consciousness interprets. This is an incomplete picture. Can you imagine, for instance, describing me as a process of combustion? I am. Every physical vehicle is in the process of exploding particles through heat and therefore of manufacturing heat in a manner similar to that of the Sun. The process is similar since we are made up of atoms in a continuous state of flux and change. The atoms gather themselves together to form elements, and these form various compounds, until we have what appears to be something quite solid to the experience of our consciousness. We could be described as something that absorbs from the environment certain elements and burns them. We subject them to an explosive process in order to extract certain forces from them and keep a constant level of heat going in our bodies. Thus, we"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWEILS: 48 too could be described as an atomic or chemical process. Is that all that we are? Does that describe what we think and feel? No! It is only a description of certain aspects that are concerned with the physical vehicle of our consciousness, the vehicle through which we express our consciousness at this particular time. Can you see that the same thing may be true in relation to the sun? Though we interpret the solar process as more or less mechanical, scientists admit that they do not understand what causes it or why it occurs. Indeed, those who think a little more deeply admit that, in as much as they are touching extraordinary organizations within the universe, one must attribute some kind of creative and creating intelligence to these occurrences, the process of the Sun and the spiral nebulae, their composition, what they do, what occurs within them. There is no way to explain these processes in terms of physical science alone. Therefore, many of our physical scientists and astronomers are tecoming more metaphysical in their approach, as you must have noticed, because of the questions that must otherwise go unanswered and because of the findings that they have made. Our physical Sun in the heavens is our life. Let us consider it in terms of this particular planet. Everything that occurs on this planet has its origin in the enerry, the iife, of the Sun. For enerry is the life or the consciousness of the Sun. Our very atmosphere is the result of the action of the Sun on this particular planet. The chemical changes that sunlight brings about, brings into expression, such as the growth of plants, is the work of the Sun. Experiments are made on the way in which plants use sunlight directly to conver.t. matter into energy for their own lives. Plants do this directly. hence we are trying to discover how they do it so that we can learn to do likewise, to have that much more command of the enerry and elements around us. Plant life draws directly on the activity of the Sun, the life of the sun. Other levels of life, such as animals, including man, who has an animal body, draw on solar enerry less directly for nutrition, but it is no less vital to them, Everything that we do is ultimately dependent upon the energy of the Sun. When we eat vegetables, the plant life that has received the energr of the Sun, we take the completed process and consume it. Anything that we eat, breathe, or do, all motion is the activity of the Sun. There is nothing else. If we cook with fuel we use solar force' Coal is the stored eners/ of the Sun; wood is the stored enerry of the Sun; oil is the stored energy of the Sun. When we burn them, we are releasing this ener$/ for our purposes, making heat with it just as the Sun makes heat. We create heat within our bodies. Heat and light are interrelated and are part of the process of livingness. When we consider the role of the Sun logically, we come to a profoundly important conclusion: this physical Sun that we see in the heavens determines the life of the planet, its life forms, the growth and development and evolution of consciousness on this planet. It is the action of the heat of the Sun and the rays of the Sun upon the atmosphere, which the sun has made and captured in its own way, that brings a6out the air currents and storms, The Sun makes rain as well as fire. The Sun makes ever5rthing on earth, and there is nothing that is not made by the Sun."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 48 3 We must not, therefore, think of the Sun as a mechanical thing. We must rather learn to see it as this Tarot Key, the Vast Countenance, the life, the spiritual Sun behind what appears as the physical outer form in our immediate environment. This is true of all the heavens; all stars are suns. Another attribution is the Collective Intelligence, We ourselves continually collect the enerry of the Sun and concentrate it to perform all our various tasks. The Sun itself apparently works in the same manner. We are not sure of the exact process, but astronomers feel that even the Sun and stars absorb enerry from clouds of energr that they pass through in their orbit about the Milky Way. It is quite in accord with Qabalistic thought that the Sun too absorbs the first emanations of matter, interstellar or cloud, in order to concentrate this tenuous matter to bring about its combustion and heat and give birth to its own children, the planets and ourselves. For we are the children of the Sun. Like all on earth, like earth itself, we are aspects of the Sun, expressions of the Sun. We are children of the Sun because we have evolved a countenance of our own. We, too, have heads. We can form, create, and do in our magic circle all sorts of things. We become miracle creators with the Sun, for the Sun. The way in which to develop true consciousness of ourselves as members of the heavens, as cosmic beings, is to stop thinking of ourselves as something like little ants crawling on a dark, heayy, little planet, imprisoned, wailing for release. We must begin to make what we are and where we are a magic fairy ring within which we dance. We are the collective intelligence together with the Sun, because we collect the Sun's energies just as surely as do all other forms of life, just as surely as do the elements\" And, collecting this energr, we express it, and to the degree that we learn consciously to collect and concentrate this energ/, to that degree do we become more and more creative, joyous, expanded consciousness, regenerated beings, That is why another Qabalistic attribution of this letter Resh is Regeneration. What regenerates but the Sun? Lack of sunlight makes us weak and ill. Children who lack the Sun develop deformities in their bone structure. We give them secondhand Sun through the use of cod liver oil, but it is still the Sun, it is still the extract of the Sun. The healing has to come directly from the Sun to begin with. We have merely found a way in which that energz is concentrated. The Sun, therefore, is called the Sun of life and light in the Bible, in the Qabalah and by schools of thought the world over. The Eryptians s5rmbolized this force as a Sun disk with wings. No matter what civilizationyou study, you will find a great mythologr attached to the Sun, representing it as a conscious being, a vital God or Goddess, Regeneration is certainly a correct attribution to the idea of the Sun as a Vast Countenance. Linked with it is another Qabalistic attribution, the pair of opposites assigned to this Key, Fertility and Sterility. You see on Key 19, Yods that pour down from the Sun. We remind you that Yod is a component of all the Hebrew letters. It is shown often in the Keys and shown as something coming from the Sun. Think of it in terms of waves of light and other forms of energr that pour from the Sun continuously and from other Suns. These particles form the cosmic rays,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 48 made up of minute emanations from atomic nuclei. Everything is made up of these particles. When they form atoms, we have them in a more organized state, but nuclear emanations of energy take place, and the resultant waves of particles pass all through space. Our atmosphere traps the great majority of cosmic rays that come from outer space and from our own Sun. If it did not we should die from excess radiation. That is why the Sun developed the kind of atmosphere that it did for this planet, to support earth life, that is if you agree that a consciousness is behind the outer form, a spiritual Sun behind the physical Sun. An interesting thing to consider is that the north and south magnetic poles of the earth attract a vast amount of these particles. Wherever you see attraction, whether in particles, elements, or between human beings, it is an aspect or expression of love on that level. The magnetic poles draw these particles and bend them in a great reciprocating current between the north and south magnetic poles. A drawing of this pattern is a fascinating sight. One of these currents of particles forms the Van Allen belt, found by our space program, a dangerous belt of particles. The north and south poles attract these particles and form them into a moving double halo. The reciprocating currents of energr between the poles allows just enough to come through the atmosphere from our point of view, just as the right amount of nourishment for the embryo comes through the placenta. Hence, every second, thousands of particles from atoms penetrate you, go all the way through you. They can penetrate deep shields of lead; they travel with intensity and speed. You are continuously being bathed through and through with particles from the Sun and from the othey Suns of the heavens. This is part of Sreur en 'iro+meat, This is an aspeet of your livingness. This is what makes you a real member of the universe. It is part of your nourishment. It is the way in which the whole universal life involves you and is in continuous contact with all elements of itself, which cannot exclude you. The Yods that descend from the Sun in Key 19 point to the fact that the Qabalists knew of this principle, knew and experienced it from the mystical levels. Now scientists have discovered it from other levels, but the principle holds true. These Yods, which are contained in every one of the Hebrew letters, indicate the same thing, physically and symbolically, that the particles of the universe are components of everything that exists, that they are the touch of the Divine. Tarot Key 9, to which is attributed this Hebrew letter, Yod, has, Qabalistically, the sense of touch as its basic expression. This is the way in which the One Life is in touch with all processes of ltself. Again, touch is part of the love aspect of God. We have thirteen Yods here. Thirteen means love and unity in Hebrew Gematria. So, we are given another message; that it is love and unity that shine down from on High, that bathe us, that live us and we them. This is something too often forgotten or overlookedl namely that we also live them. This is a point we want to convey as clearly and forcefully as we can. This we will try to do in the technique for using this key. We will try to give you the feeling, project to you the awareness of the All from the emotional level. We know nothing until we know it in our hearts as well as with our minds. This is borne out by the fact that the Sun, Qabalistically, is assigned to the chakra corresponding to the cardiac ganglion in the physical body, although the chakra is in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 48 astral being. The Sun center lies at the cardiac ganglion, or heart, something that most do not realize, although mystics have seen it. I have been aware of it for many years. In actualit5l, we all receive emanations from the Sun directly into our heart center. Our heart centers are the receiving stations, on an inner level, from the unifying principle that is behind the Sun, the evolution of consciousness. It is the Sun that expresses and creates this principle of which we are a part. The heart center is the center through which we feel love. For ages people have spoken of the heart as that which is touched whenever there is compassion, whenever there is love, in all the feeling aspects of life, especially the higher feelings of consciousness, love. The number 13 indicates this specifically. The 13th Tarot Key, too, called Death, assigned to Scorpio, rules the reproductive function, Reproduction is closely linked with the pair of opposites assigned to this Key, fertility and sterility. Seeing such links in the association process is part of learning how to let the mind associate from symbol to symbol. This does not come all at once. If you study regularly, it becomes a part of your knowing, a part of your way of thinking, almost by osmosis. It is not hard to learn, unless you sit down and think, \"I have to learn this all now.\" A hundred years from now you will see them in a completely different light. You are continuously growing and changing, and you see and interpret from this growth, which is a part of the process of the Sun. The important thing is to continue to collect, to become consciously, as you already are subconsciously, an attuned aspect of the Collective Intelligence, so that you can collect and concentrate and express full creative beauty.
