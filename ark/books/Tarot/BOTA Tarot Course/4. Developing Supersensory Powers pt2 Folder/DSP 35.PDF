[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 35 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures I hope you are beginning to understand the attitude of reversal. It comes in many ways. The strange thing is that when we begin to feel h\"ppy and grateful for what it is we have or are doing today, and if we have other gifts, we find ourselves doing other things, performing greater services. Do not think that great services are those that put names in the headlines such as acting and sports. Those whose names appear in the headlines the most are often our greatest failures. What service do they perform? Is success having one's name come up before one's fellow creatures? Criminals do this! Does that make them successes? This is often just a bid for attention. We must reverse our attitude entirely so that whatever we are doing, we realize we are doing something magnificent, whether it be recognized by the world or not. We must realize that when we make a bed, it is a miracle. Even if we make it for ourselves. Should we begrudge ourselves a nicely made bed? Are we worse than our fellow man? We are performing a service toward members of humanity-- ourselves! Whatever it is that we do, we must learn to do it with the recognition of the riches involved, recognizing that this is our place, this is our work for today. What we shall do next week, or tomorrow, we need not be concerned with. In this attitude we must use our reason, for the reasoning ability is emphasized in Key 12 by the crossed legs of the Hanged Man, forming the figure 4, pointing to Key 4, the Emperor. The red of his hose is another indication of Aries, of the Emperor, who shows us that we cannot throw away our reasoning ability. The moon symbols on the Hanged Man's jacket symbolize the subconscious processes as subordinated to reason. We must use our reasoning faculties, our recollective elements, our subconsciousness properly. True reasoning will show us that if we want to always have a reasonable amount of food, clothing and shelter, the first thing we must do is transfer our reliance from the externals to the Self within. Most of us have an adequate share of these essentials, true, but they are not permanent in this life or in future incarnations unless we become liberated souls in this one. Liberated from dependence upon externals. We must reverse the feeling of reliance on the outside but continue doing our best in the material world. In this way we learn to manipulate the physical universe, as we are supposed to do. Mastering this or that situation, this or that ability, security in all areas is possible only if you feel bound to the universal life. Another important idea expressed by Key L2 is freedom. This is the most thoroughly bound creature that you will see in all the keys, except for Key 15. But we are not looking at a rope, remember, but at whirling motion. The Hanged Man is not free, surely. He is tied. This is somethingthat none of us like. We all worship the word \"freedom.\" I said the word freedom. What is freedom? Freedom is perhaps the most misunderstood word in our vocabulary because our understanding of the real principle of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 35 the universe and our own consciousness is upside down. I should like to recall to you the experience that I related when we discussed Key 8, Strength, the experience I called Cosmic Animal Consciousness, the experience of the primeval mental \"stuff\" that I received through my cat. The quality of that experience, beyond all else, was an extraordinary wild freedom, utterly unharnessed and unconscious. There is a statement that goes, \"Freedom is the choice of one's own disciplines,\" The choice of one's own disciplines. Think about this and apply it to various ideas, and you will see just how profound it is. I came out of that experience of animal soul consciousness with the realization that the primary difference between human and animal consciousness was inhibition, That realization has grown and expanded as the years have passed. What is inhibition but the opposite of freedom? Freedom is the choice of one's disciplines, What are disciplines but deliberate inhibitions; the choice to inhibit something! This is what makes us human. It is the primary difference between human consciousness and,the lower level, ability to limit, which we know is the ability to control. Inhibition,limitation, control, discipline; these give us the ability to say, \"I am I,\" an individual, instead of being part of an indistinguishable wave of ecstatic free joy. That type of freedom is what we have emerged from. If you wish to regress to it, I doubt that you could because the Higher Self has gone to so much trouble to grow you to your present state. One of the great problems in occultism is that those who have an experience of that kind often exult that they have achieved Samad-hi when all the;'have done is to go backwards into the primeval. It is ecstatic, but if you do not know \"I am I,\" if you have not the essence of self-knowingness and self-direction, you are no longer human. It is feeling human that is such a miracle. Everything in evolution tends toward the ability to hold and direct. How can you direct anything if there is no limitation on freedom? How can you know anything if there is no limitation on freedom? The very act of knowing requires that the mind be limited in an area for investigation. Do you see how the principle works? No matter where you look, the miracle of your mentality is the miracle of deliberately giving up freedom for something far greater. Yet, all of us have a longing for freedom, but we put it in the wrong place. We attribute it to the wrong areas. Some of us fight for it like tigers. We all have been indoctrinated by our environment. Nothing we do leads to real freedom when we walk in the ways of the world. You may think that you are free, but you have been conditioned by the race mind, societSr, relatives and friends, both in this incarnation and in lives long past, to think and feel and react in certain ways. Personality in most human beings is an automatic response mechanism for the race mind. Hence, if you wish to do something, or do not wish to do something, you rationalize. We are motivated by the propaganda of newspapers, radio, television, other people and friends. They move us like men on a chess board, Yet, we inflate our chests and say, \"'We are free!\" Most of us do not even begin to know the meaning of freedom. We may feel free, feeling free and being free are two different things. Look at the Hanged Man! He is bound, yet that is the only freedom that a personalitSr can have. Are you to hang from the cosmic law, to be bound by it, or are you"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 35 free to be manipulated as an automatic response mechanism, free to have ideas thrust upon you from the lower and less evolved mass mind. It comes down to that. The heart has a strange sense of feeling free to turn right or left. I have told you what happened when this idea came to me, \"Am I free to turn right or left.\" Each key brings in some of the elements of the other, but they are all aspects of one basic idea. The thing to remember is that the personality, the mask, the persona that we wear together with its body, its intellect and its emotions, is something conditioned through past incarna- tions, bound by karma, by everything that is going on around it. The personality is never free. It is a matter of the choice of one's own disciplines. Will you let yourself be moved by the mass mind and its values, or will you hang from the Cosmic Life, the Divine Will? Many have definite ideas about what their freedom is or is not. I knew one man who considered it very important to be free; he did not want to be bound by marriage. I knew a woman, too, who felt she must remain free. The man felt he needed to remain free in order to follow the paths to the divine. The woman felt that her profession demanded freedom from marriage. These people thought they were protecting their freedom. What were they really doing? You must begin to look at the undercurrents, the subconscious promptings, of self-conscious actions. If you strive to protect whatever it is you mean by your freedom, you forfeit a certain choice of bonds. We all strive to protect our freedom in certain areas, and this is natural and not blameworthy. Nevertheless, if we yield to an irrational need to protect our ideas of freedom, we shall remain free of relationships that might have given us riches. Thus we are more easily blown by the winds. The very act of refusing to assume any of what the world calls responsibilities or shackles may lead to finding oneself unshackled indeed; free of securitSr, love, friends and experiences. The values in life lie not in protecting freedom, but rather in not looking upon ties as being bonds but privileges of interrelationships with the cosmic pattern. There are some relationships from which we should protect ourselves, it is true. There are people who, when we give them a little of ourselves, take all. Real freedom lies in retaining the right of deliberate conscious choice as to what bonds we shall assume, and then not seeing them as bonds but as ties with the Higher Self, as the rope on the Hanged Man's ankle that binds us to the Cosmic Life, that gives us a conscious living part in It. We must be willing to see it that way and be willing to receive the repercussions. Sometimes we shall be hurt, human nature being what it is, and human evolution not yet having achieved fullness. There will be weaknesses both within ourselves and in others, Yet, clinging to the One Life by whatever outer cord is greater than being blown by the winds to nothingness, better than being unable to know what to be or where to be, or why to be. Security has many meanings and freedom, when we come to analyze it, is but a word. The Higher Self is truly free, but we do not know our Higher Self as \"I\" when we identify ourselves with our personality. The Higher Self is free, is consciously one with the Divine Life. The Higher Self freely chooses to follow the path of self-discipline for the purpose of gaining consciousness, awareness, expansion, livingness, lovingness."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 35 We can cry out for the love of God, but if we do not remove the insecurit5r from our emotions, if we are determined to stay free of any responsibilities to others, if we refuse the richness of experience, how can we be bound to God? I do not mean that we should choose indiscriminately, or that any one particular choice is the best for all persons. To learn to feel complete inner stability of selfhood, we must consciously admit that whatever comes, we are willing to do the Divine Will, and that if we make mistakes we are willing to be shown by the Divine Self that they are mistakes. This is stability; this is security. Notice that the Hanged Man's head is below the surface of the earth, signifying that things mundane and material have a direct tie with the cosmic. Kether is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether, but after another fashion. His head radiates light, and the expression on his face is one of serene joy, because he knows. He is full of ecstasy and joy though bound. People who truly love do not feel that they are tied or that freedom has been taken from them. Their hearts and minds overflow with joy, reaching out to the Lord of Life with gratitude for the bond. Is this a tie, a limitation, a lack of freedom? What could be freer than the loving heart, reaching out to share its love with life? And this freedom comes from the ability to love. which is the ability to make relationships. And relationships are limitations on freedom! Every time we make a new friend we have put a limitation upon our freedom. Our time and our actions are, to some extent, circumscribed by each friendship. We cannot then always do just as we please. This is true of every relationship, and the closer the more true. A child poses a great limitation on the freedom of the parents. Yet, look at the joy that the parents feel in this limitation, They see it not as a limitation but as a privilege. It expands their hearts. They choose to limit their freedom in order to expand their beingness. The greatest lesson that work with and meditation upon this key can give us is the realization that we must reverse, in every way we can, our whole attitude toward what it is that gives us securifr and what it is in us that is really free. If we could begin to act, consciously and subconsciously, on the true concepts of both of these, our lives would change to a degree beyond anything we could imagine. To achieve the realization of freedom and security means practicinga feelingof happiness,joy, and gratitude for whatever it is that we have and whatever we do. \"To him that hath shall be given, and from him who hath not even that which he hath shall be taken away.\" To him that hath the feeling of stability, the ability to rely upon the Cosmic Life for security, the feeling of the richness of life and gratitude for it, the feeling ofjoy in his contribution to the work of life, to him will be opened up fittingly and swiftly other ways of serving and sharing. What form these take will not matter to him, for he knows that he is serving and being. This seems simple, but you are working against the powerful mass mind idea, so we advise you to seek the company as much as possible of those of like high ideals and aspirations, those whose minds run on the same lines as your own. Try, if you can, not to be too much in the company and atmosphere of those who live in the lower reaches of response and are completely bound up with materialistic ideas. We have much to reverse, and the mass mind inertia of unevolved humanity pulls at us to remain as we are. In the Eastern Tradition, too, the aspirant is usually advised to choose the company of those of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 35 like mind, because of the effect of telepathic impact and repeated negative indoctrination against aspiration. Negative suggestions are constant and ubiquitous; we must forever be alert to what lies beyond what we see or hear. Television, radio, newspapers, books and people present erroneous ideas. Our minds must learn to automatically reverse these ideas, our emotions must learn to refuse them. Do not let such suggestions become embedded in your consciousness. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 12, THE HANGED MAN Keep in mind that this key is associated with water and with reflection. Permeate yourself with the limpid blue of water. See it as extending for two feet around you. See yourself as immersed in an ocean of blue. You are the reflection in this water of the Hanged Man, right-side up, as he is reversed. Picture Key 12 reflected in the water with you as the figure. The tip of the Hanged Man's golden halo touches you. Picture that halo as extending and enlarging itself as it surrounds both your head and his, to help awaken you to his knowledge. This exercise should help you in reversingnegative responses. If you have a pattern of despondency, hatred, or insecurity that needs reversal, you will find astonishing help in this exercise. The moment you find a negative thought or emotion enveloping you, immediately immerse yourself in the blue waters, reflecting the Hanged Man, letting his powers lead you to cosmic guidance, letting his stability reverse the negative feeling. While you are holding the image, consciously reverse your emotion or your thought. Pull the power down. Try to feel the joy of lnowingthatyou are secure, eternally secure, because you depend on God's life which is your life. If you hate, turn it to love. Feel love and gratitude for the capacity to know what is happening. Think of someone or something that you love and feel the welling up of the emotions. Then transfer this feeling to the negative area. This exercise makes it easier to train the emotions. AFFIRI\\4ATION: I sumender myself utterly to guidance from the Cosmic Self. I am bound to the One Will, and in this bond lies my true freedom and security. Freedom to participate in life's experiences, freedom to love, freedom to serve, freedom to be aware. I reverse the erroneous ideas of this world and thus come to know the real securiW of unitv with the All."}]
