[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 22 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures This lesson and the following one deal with the Lovers, Key 6. Tarot Key 6 is assigned to the zodiacal sign of Gemini, The Twins. The Hebrew letter printed on this key means \"the sword.\" There is a very special meaning connected with the symbolism of the sword. Qabalistically, the sword is assigned to the element of air. On the table of the Magician, Tarot Key 1, the dagger represents this sword and the element of air. In the assignment of the signs of the zodiac to the four elements, Gemini is an airy sign. The sword cleaves apart. Cleaving apart, psychologically speaking, has to do with knowing how to weigh one thing against another. The self-conscious mind is self-conscious because of its power to discern one object from another. In other words, the self-conscious mind is the way in which the One Self experiences the difference between one leaf and another, between a tree and the sky, between one person and another. This power to discern differences is a self-conscious faculty which is symbolized by Tarot Key 6 and the sword. The symbol of the sword in its negative aspect could be exemplified in the battle of the sexes. In its positive aspect it relates to attraction of opposites because you cannot have attraction without separation; you cannot know love unless you have known hate; you cannot know day unless you have known night; you cannot know joy unless you have known sorrow. Ii'or all of these things are opposites, two parts of one thing. Yesterday and tomorrow are only the two polarities of something we call time. In the deeper sense. you cannot have manifestation without separation of polarities. The law of polarity is completely bound up with the law of consciousness itself. We can have no self-consciousness without it. It is also one of the explanations for the problem of evil, which we will explain when we come to the appropriate Tarot key. We hope to show you how to perceive the true meaning of so-called good and so-called evil, so that you will never again be caught in the trap of barbarism. Understanding is the key to all things. This Tarot key and its Hebrew letter are assigned, Qabalistically, to the function of discrimination and to the sense of smell. Why smell? If you stop to reflect on how we use the word smell you will realize it is a very accurate association. When you say that something smells bad, using the phrase figuratively, in its psychic and subjective sense, there is something literally true about it. When we say that something smells bad, we mean that it is not good . The sense of smell is j ust as closely associated with the psychic faculties as the inner hearing and inner seeing. Being able to smell out that which is not usually apparent has to do with discrimination. In Tarot Key 6, the two human figures s}.'mbolize Adam and Eve. Notice that behind the male figure stands a tree with flames that represent the twelve signs of the zodiac and their divisions, or decanates, the three parts of each sign of the zodiac. These trefoil flames s5rmbolize the different types of personalities, and they stand behind Adam who represents self-consciousness. Behind Eve, representing subconsciousness, we have the fruit that caused so much trouble and the serpent of temptation. Eve has long been blamed for eating the apple of knowledge of good and evil--opposites. However, it is lucky that she did, for otherwise there could not have been the whole evolution of consciousness. Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 22 evolves through being tempted, as you can readily see. From the mistakes we make, we reap repercussions, and we learn what we should not do. This process is often called the law of karma, It is because of this that in Qabalah, the Hebrew word for the tempter is associated by number with the Hebrew word \"Messiah,\" which in Greek is Christos, and in English is Christ\" Christ and the tempter are not too different things but opposite aspects of the same thing, which interact in order to bring about certain conditions or certain developments. Most of us who tread the Path of Return have reached a point beyond the types of temptation which keep us tied to materialistic evaluations. This, too, is a matter of discrimination. If we continue to meet adversity, it is because we keep getting the things we ask for. It is interesting that in the end getting what we ask for is the reason we stop wanting immature things. That is why in occultism it is said that the way to overcome our desires is to fulfill them. Otherwise, they are buried deep in the subconsciousness and they \"smell\" bad, they rot there, and come out in sicknesses of the psyche, in poisonous elements, Many of you have met persons who are infuriated at the notion of anyone playing cards because card playing is evil. This is fanaticism. Others feel great guilts about sex. These have deeply buried subconscious repressions with relation to sex and eagerly seek out and harshlyjudge quite normal sexual manifestation in others. In Key 6 the two figures represent on one level, self-consciousness and subconsciousness. They are nude; there is no self-deception. Self-consciousness is looking directly at subconsciousness. He can look into his own heart, into his own emotional nonditionins's- He does not hide his emotiorrs f+om hirnself. Terot Ke'r 6 e.vrnbelizes the correct relationship that should exist between our self-conscious and subconscious mind. What exactly is that relationship? Self-consciousness is looking at subconsciousness; why is that? We see with our consciousness; we do not see with our eyes. We hear with our consciousness; we do not hear with our ears. Eyes and ears are only outer instruments and although it is self-consciousness that directs attention to a vibration, it is subconsciousness that reflects it as a mirror to self-consciousness. In order for self- consciousness to see through the reflection, self-consciousness has to have the proper relationship with its own subconsciousness. This proper relationship will permit the reflections to be mirrored back accurately, whether it be a picture, a person, a condition or an emotion. Notice that subconsciousness is looking at the angel, Raphael, the Healer. It is this state that we are working towards. Our problems arise because subconsciousness has not been trained to look at the angel. In the natural man, subconsciousness looks at self- consciousness because self-consciousness has conditioned this response in every way possible. Thus subconsciousness receives self-conscious misinterpretations and evaluations of experience and acquires a completely warped picture of life and a distorted image of reality. How shall we bring about the development of discrimination? We must train our subconsciousness to refuse to accept warped or misinterpreted conclusions about the environment; we must train it instead to turn to superconsciousness for the correct interpretation of the conditions, emotions, situations, and relationships of life."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 22 3 In the lessons you have received earlier, Dr. Case emphasized a little point which we will give you in a more vivid manner as part of the technique for this key, thus enabling you to use the keys more d5rnamically. The point that Dr. Case made is that it is very important for us to realize that everything we receive in the way of feeling, seeing and reacting is received throueh subconsciousness! Illuminations and experiences of cosmic consciousness also come through subconsciousness but not from it. Subconsciousness is the channel to higher knowing; there is no other channel! This subconscious channel must be trained and transmuted if we are to use it wisely. We must put the whole principle of visualization and demonstration in the hands of the angel in Tarot Key 6. This, it is true, is not an easy task but it can be done. Elementary metaphysical groups often entertain you with a few little jokes, some of them very clever. You are assured that if you will think thus and so, and do thus and so, you will succeed in getting what you want. They want you to feel you are walking in truth, when in truth all of us walk in various degrees of self-deception. Self-deception is the cause of most of our problems. Everything that happens to us happens because of the patterns we are unaware of in subconsciousness; patterns we have formed during present and past incarnations. If we decide to use creative imagination to project something we want, but at the same time have a strong emotional pattern in subconsciousness against it, we fail miserably. These patterns are strong indeed: they are carried over from the past and they continue to repeat themselves until matters become so uncomfortable that we are forced to wake up and do something. We can, however, be quite miserable and still fail to develop enough discrimination to recognize in what areas we must work, We have to learn to watch our own responses. We have to learn how to see into our own real motives. As an example of this (examples teach better than theory; that is why Jesus taught in parables) is the following case: I know a lovely woman in late middle life who has never married. She is a very magnetic and attractive person, Yet, every time she has really cared for someone, something happened to prevent the marriage that she thought she wanted. After we became close friends, we discussed this and I began to notice her attitudes. I became aware, for instance, of her relationship with her mother, who was very aged and had no one in the world but her daughter. Apparently the daughter could not bear her seemingly devoted mother. She would say to me, \"My mother called me today. She interferes with my freedoml she tries to order me around; she tries to tell me what to do. I can'tstand it!\" I said, \"Whatdid she do?\" \"Oh, she says things like,'Nowyou be sure to wear your sweater; it is going to be chilly tonight.\"' I said, \"But don't you recognize loving concern?\" She said, \"It's not loving concern. She is just a tyrant. She wants to run me.\" Scarcely a week would pass that she didn't tell me some little incident of her mother's interference. On other occasions she would tell me of her troubles with a certain person who had a power drive, who wanted authority--the authority to run her. This fear of being dominated always aroused her emotions. The idea of someone trying to run her or have authority over her was unbearable. This woman, although she had many men as friends and some as suitors, had never invited any of them to her home for dinner. She thought they should take her out to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 22 dinner. Now she could not understand why she couldn't find anyone to marry. Actually she was very subtly seeing to it, subconsciously, that she would not accept marriage. In other words, whatever value companionship would have had was not enough to make up for what she considered her privacy, her freedom to come and go and do as she pleased. She is a very lonely person, but she is beginning to see why. Although she spent nearly twelve years in analysis by different psychoanalytical schools, it was not until she started working with Tarot that she began to recognize the conflicts within herself. She often evoked the picture of marriage in order to project for herself this situation, but she could not picture a positive situation because these picturings had to come through subconsciousness, and from subconscious substance. Her whole pattern of response in a reciprocal relationship was damaged, This is a good example of conflict between what we think we want and our buried subconscious reactions to that want. We must apply discrimination to our own attitudes in order to discover what it is in us that interferes with our havingajoyous and fulfilled life. We are meant to be joyous and fulfilled and we shall achieve this goal sooner or later. When, however, we take up Tarot for forced evolutionary training, we have not so long to go provided we persevere, Tarot, if you work with it regularly, effects a complete iransmutation of the patterns buried deep in subconsciousness, It is not really necessary to know the origin of a certain pattern;just recognizinga certain emotion within ourselves is enough, in learning how to watch ourselves. This is self-consciousness looking at subconsciousness and not being deceived by false interpretations of desires, Otherwise you have a house divided. To the degree that we are not in harmony with our own subconsciousness, to that degree we shall not be in harmony with the opposite sex. As within, so withoutl as above, so below. Sometimes what happens outside can be the signal of something to work on from the inside. We should not arbitrarily choose an idea or an attitude because this, too, can become a pattern requiring transmutation. We should simply keep in mind that subconsciousness is to look to superconsciousness for verification of every interpretation of experience that self-consciousness makes. Subconsciousness must refuse misinterpretations and turn instead to the Higher Self. Then the reflection of the Higher Wisdom comes back to self-consciousness. Subconsciousness is a mirror, reflecting back to self-consciousness whatever it receives. If it is trained to receive only from the higher level, it is astonishing what changes take place in our desires. They change without our seeming to work hard self-consciously; it happens automatically. We must also learn to discriminate between the right and the wrong time as well as right and wrong methods. As long as our attention and consciousness has to function on the physical plane, we have to be aware of certain restrictions. For example, quite a few years ago we carried on all of the work of B.O.T,A, from a little pastorate house. When Dr. and Mrs. Case were away, I was alone there on the hilltop and I could not drive a car, Being lame, I had never been able to learn how to drive since I found I could not balance myself behind the wheel. Someone told me that there were special devices that could be made to handle almost any situation, and that one could be made to enable me to handle all of the pedals at once"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 22 5 and with one leg. These devices, however, would have to be specially made and would be very expensive, so that I would require a new car, not a used one. The prohibitive cost of the devices acted as a deterrent in my consciousness. I had quite a difficult time, being on crutches, and occasionally had to pull groceries up the hill in a wagon. I knew I was eventually going to have a car to drive, yet every time I tried to visualize it, to work on it according to the methods given in the course on Seven Steps in Practical Occultism, somehow I could not picture this car properly. I thought, \"Well, if I can't picture it properly, it isn't time; I'll drop it.\" About every six months I would pick up this goal to see if I could work on it; I couldn't, so I dropped it again. In the meanwhile I thought about other things; about the wonderful opportunity I was having to find out how fine people were and what marvelous friends I had, There were many compensations. Then finally I suddenly and sharply realized that the time had come to get my car! I could visualize myself driving with no problems at all. The next morning I asked a friend to please take me to look at some cars. He wanted to know if I had had an inheritance! But he took me to a dealer where I got into a little Ford Anglia, and much to my astonishment and delight, the height of the gas and clutch pedals were exactly right. I was elated and said, \"This is it!\" The salesman said, \"Would you like to buy it now?\" I said, \"Oh no, not now, but I know this is the car I am going to buy.\" He said, \"The list price on this car has just gone up $60 and we have only two left at the old price; today is probably your last chance.\" I thought he might not be telling me the truth, but on the other hand he might be' He said, \"Why don't you put a deposit on it?\" I said, \"Oh nol I don't know when I will be able to get it; I just know that I am going to get one.\" He said, \"$5 will be enough,\" Before I left, he had written up a contract. The next day I was again with Dr. and Mrs. Case. I told them enthusiastically about having found a car that fit my body and my knee. Mrs. Case said, \"Isn't it odd that I just had a letter this morning. I received a very small inheritance that I never expected. If that car fits you, I will get it for you.\" And she did. I called up the salesman and said, \"You hold onto that car; I'll be over for it.\" Believe me, there is no human being on the face of this earth who drives a powerful and expensive car who could even begin to have the rich rewards that I had driving around in my little car; they are paupers in comparison, For it was the freedom it gave me, the widening of my horizons; that gratitude to life came because I did not have the car before! I could really appreciate it. Can you see the meaning of discrimination in time in this example? When I found that I could not image the car, I did not eat my heart out but dropped the whole process and continued feeling at peace. I knew that the time was not right, that something else had to work itself out first. What it was, I am not sure, except that learning how to be grateful was one part of the lesson of life."}]
