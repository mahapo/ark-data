[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 47 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures Consciousness interprets whatever happens to us, and these interpretations are dependent upon past experience. We have all gone through a long succession of experiences together, in order to know spirit in a specialized way, in its varied and myriad forms. Whenever we see form or experience form, consciousness is interpreting it. Nevertheless, the experience indicates that there is something there to make an impact on consciousness. There is a reality there, even if, in our consciousness we are deluded as to what that reality is because we see it only partially. When we die, we withdraw our consciousness from concentration on the electromagnetic vibrational levels that gives the experience of form. We withdraw consciousness from our physical form, as well as from that of the planet, and transfer it into its next form. It is not that we have escaped from something unspiritual into a more spiritual state, it is only that consciousness can stand the discipline of the compressions of reality for just so long. Then it must withdraw, just as you can work for just so long and then you have to sleep. You can run for just so long and then you have to rest. In the same way, under ordinary conditions, when we die, it is only because consciousness cannot remain concentrated longer without becoming very weary. In physical life consciousness is in a state of disciplining itself severely, in order to deepen the cup of its awareness and develop the powers of its beingness. Nevertheless, the state of coneentration that holds the eleetromagnetie substa,nee in form is the physical world. It is no more unreal than any other experience of consciousness. The way in which we interpret it, the importance we give it in one sense and the unimportance we give it in another sense, is the delusion. We must begin to see the physical world for what it really is, see it as a reality, and that means seeing our own bodies and all other bodies as divine. Whatever you touch is holy ground. Be careful to not despise your Lord in human form, as we do constantly, by setting ourselves standards of what is beautiful and what is unbeautiful. Dr. and Mrs. Case and I knew a man once, who, in many ways, from the physical point of view, was one of the ugliest men you might ever see. Yet, he was one of the most beautiful men that we had ever met. We all felt this about him. We loved to look at him, because his eyes had a soft lovingness and understanding and kindness. His skin glowed with goodness. His mouth had a tenderness about it, despite the unbeautiful shape of the features in terms of the idea of beautiful features. This man was beautiful. You did not have to fall in love with him to see that he was beautiful. Yet you did, in a way, because to feel that goodness, and sweetness and lovingness was falling in love. We have fixed notions, patterns, of beautiful and unbeautiful in the environment and in relation to ourselves, and hence, we add lack of beauty to lack of beauty, They say that man has a genius for destroying the beauty of nature. In many ways he does. He destroys it because he lacks a true concept of what beauty really is. He destroys because of his whole attitude toward the temple of God, toward the Garment of Adonai, toward all things on the physical plane."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 47 We, as aspirants, have to do something very important. We must learn to utilize the physical plane, the form side of God, our bodies, in such a way that we will reach whatever our highest capacity is at this time. The reason we must use this form side of life for growth are many, but one of the most important is that ordinarily evolution can proceed only in and through the physical plane, Our highest capacity will vary with the individual, but the principle remains. Those who look down upon the physical, who meditate ways of escaping from their own bodies, do not realize what they do to themselves. They manage to attain to very wonderful and mystical experienees, it is true, but this will be at the expense of the other part of their nature, the side that could give them the power to use these experiences properly. What usually happens in such cases is that, when they die, they have to return, even though they may have attained to a very high state, and they must go through disciplines on the physical plane, until they learn to see it in its real form, until they realize that the physical plane is an aspect of spirit, a joyous and amazingaspect of spirit. It is the wayby which spirit evolved for itself individuality, the marvel of distinctiveness in each of us. Evolution takes place in and through physical form, Therefore, if we keep up with the work as it is given to us in our courses and training, we shall have the opportunity to flrnish our evolution on the other side, once we drop the physical vehicle. That is, if we have done honor to, and brought blessing and beauty and spiritual understanding into and through our physical form and our environment. We can thus avoid many of the harsh disciplines we bring upon ourselves. Gencrally speaking, evoluticn is possible only on the physical plane, but ihere coiiles a point in our evolution at which we can remain conscious, holding the individuality and the realization of the importance of the substance of God on all vibrational levels. Having reached this point, and because of the special linkage we have with and through our work, we can, when we pass over, be taken in hand by those who have gone before us, for they are both incarnate and discarnate beings. We can be helped to continue evolving so that we attain to what is almost full mastery, while we are on the other side. We can learn how to continue affecting the physical plane, without having to be immersed in the agonies and nightmares that take place here. If we do all that we can, keep ourselves on the path in the proper manner, eventually we, of course, have to come back into incarnation and be tested. The tests have to do with the ability to control our thinking and feeling processes in relation to our physical environment, to our own body. Here is the crux of the matter. Most people have considerable fault to find with their bodies. I have been astonished to hear some of the most beautiful of people remark that they hate this or that aspect of their bodies. The very hating continues to unfold and build in the organization of the vehicle the picture that is held. If you hold a clear and unhappy picture, you continue to build into yourself bodily unhappiness\" That is why sleep and organization are associated with Tarot Key 18\" We shall show you how to work with your body, but to be successful, you must love it. I wish that I could transport you with me back to the time when I was five and have you share with me the astonishing experience that I had, when I fell in love with my form and my"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 47 3 face, and give you the essence of what it is we need to know and develop. You must see yourselves and your bodies in a way utterly different from the way you now see them. It should not matter to you whether or not your body has a defect. We have more than one body. If your self-image changes, you change. Unfortunately, although we keep discarding the electrons of our being and replace them with new ones, too often we replace them in accordance with our negative images. We replace the same image, in a more and more exaggerated fashion, Hence we feel more and more disgusted with ourselves and more and more critical of ourselves. This is sinning against the Lord of the Universe, and against the miracle that it has created. Our attitude toward our body and other bodies, our idea that vehicles are not spirit, is sin. The vehicle is meant to be SPIRITUALTZED. To the degree that we attain this higher attitude and realization, to that degree does every atom in our body become etherealized\" When this happens, when we let the Higher Self hold the proper images and take charge of the organization, we become ever more beautiful, no matter how much older we grow. There is beauty for every age. I think that a beautiful soul becomes the more beautiful, the older the physical vehicle g?ows. The young are like pieces of flesh with two eyes, glancing all about. The soul, which is the character, has not yet come through. They may have very lovely features, but not beauty. Real beauty has to do with an essence, a feeling nature of the being, habitual to that particular person. It takes time for the beauty in the bone to work its way through the flesh. By growing that feeling nature, we etherealize our bodies. We can make them into anything that we wish, except that most of us have not reached the point at which we are able to concentrate that long. That is why we need to retire to the astral, and then come back for the next incarnation's work. We should do as much of this work on the body as we can, now, while we are here. It is habit pattern forms that make the body. Your body is changed in accordance with what you do and how you act. A concert pianist has not the same body as one who does not play the piano. He has taken years, time and trouble to concentrate and exercise, and has developed certain muscles. He has built a specialized body, because of an image in his mind that has driven him to action. Action is the secret. That is why you see the Path on the Key. It must be part of your Path of Return. You cannot simply sit inertly and dream within your mind. The mind must be the ensouling force that drives the body into doing and into being. When I was twelve I took my first typing class. I watched the demonstrations of the teacher, and when we were doing our first exercises I said to myself, \"Such a little time to practice in schooMt will take forever to become automatic.\" I decided to memorize the keyboard and hold it in my mind. I would practice mentally. I did that every night. I did the exercises to mental music. I learnbd to t5rye in an unbelievably short time, because I kept practicing. I was putting into my mind a habit pattern so that each finger responded automatically the minute I thought of a letter. I did the same thing when I learned to drive; I practiced it mentally, as well as physically. We have to be in action in many ways, mentally as well as physically, but we have to test this action, by making it come into manifestation on the physical plane. Anythingyou wish to accomplish should be practiced mentally. You will be amazed at how much more you will be able to do with your vehicle. This is control; this is power; this is conscious direction of the vehicle; this is the secret of reachingto other parts of your nature, of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CTASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 47 attaining to higher experiences. You begin to recognize that the mind is the causative factor behind manifestations. We wish to convey to you the particular feeling that we want you to develop. All experience of a higher order is evolved feeling. If you know a thing intellectually, and yet do not know it with your heart, you do not really know it. We must know it both ways, with the mind and with the heart. This is what we mean by bringing the mental and the emotional responses into harmony with what is. The exercise given at the end of this lesson is most important, especially the looking back over the path you have come, and being able to bless the past. When we say, \"being able to bless the past,\" we are referring to every physical condition, every physical environment, and every physical relationship that you have experienced, This you must keep in mind during the exercise. You must learn to see your body as the miraculous garment of Adonai ha-Eretz, that name for the Lord used for the plane of earth. It is a divine name attributed to the physical plane. This is a good thing to remember in your exercisesl be sure that it is included in your thinking' Each one of the ten divine emanations of the One Life, the Sephirah, has a specific divine name for its part, its function. Malkuth, the tenth Sephirah or emanation, refers to the physical plane and its divine name is Adonai ha-Eretz. We are attempting to bring into our brain consciousness the essence of spirit, of feeling, of life, of love, of reverence and beauty. This concerns experiences in and through the physical vehicle, so Adonai ha-Eretz is the appropriafe divine name. The feeling that your body is holy is not going to develop if you merely think it intellectually, or if you bring it to mind only duringyour exercises. The exercises give you a little extra push, the fuel so to speak, but you must practice in every way that your imagination can conceive. Practice, not only in relation to your body, but also in relation to the bodies of those you love, and the bodies or forms in nature, the tree, the flower, the bird, the blade of grass. All of these are the garments of Adonai' It is easy to evoke that feeling when we love someone or something very deeply, but it is more difficult in relation to ourselves, for some reason. I do not know why. You will have to do some seemingly very foolish things to bring this awareness to yourself\" For instance, when you take a bath or a shower, and are soaping yourself, say to yourself, \"I am washing the temple of the living God.\" If you sit down to eat, let your heart be lifted up to the miracle of having an individual quality that is able to build and express through a vehicle like yours. Feel the wonder of it, the marvel of it and say, \"I shall now give the nourishment of the Gods to the body of Adonai.\" This is an integral part of the exercises, These are things that you should think about and meditate on, in relation to every exercise. When you get into bed at night and pull the sheets over you, say, \"I now lovingly pull the sheets about this tender, beloved, body of the Lord of Life.\" When you smell a flower, let your heart wash with gratitude at the miracle of your vehicle, of God being able to have this experience in and through another vehicle of God, this precious relationship."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 47 5 Whenyou drive a car, think of the marvel of your body, that its motion is able to do this. When you walk, think of the glory, the miracle of the temple of God. \"Look at the grace with which I can flow,\" Picture yourself walking gracefully from one room to another. If you happen to have a beloved, then it is very easy to think, \"The wonder of the Lord of the Universe, that I can have the sensory experience, the glory of touching the skin of this vehicle of God, my beloved.\" Bring God into the expression, the experience, whether you walk, or talk, or eat, or inhale. Every time that you inhale anything lovely you should think, \"I am inhalingthe body of Adonai,\" for you are, else you would not have a sensory experience. You should love your body for being able to experience such wonder, and bless and pet it. Let your hands run against your arms and your face, and feel, \"God loves me. This is the vehicle of God, housing the spirit of the begotten child of Adonai.\" This is a much more pleasant way to live, than to moan and groan about physical shortcomings you may imagine. It is true, too. It is in accordance with reality. Whatever the handicap you may have, it is just a mental image, a problem that has come up karmically. It means nothing; the beauty is there; the miracle is there. Beauty has nothing to do with our concept of form, It is important, therefore, to begin to feel beauty in the vehicle, Your vehicle will be much kinder to you, if you love it, because it is a group of little consciousnesses that your mind controls, and you have probably been unjust to them. It is time to begin to love them, because of what they do for you; think of what you should be doing for them, for yourself, and for God. That is what etherealizes your physical body, spiritualizes it, gives it the capacity to hold cosmic love, to feel cosmic love flowing into it more fully. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 18. THE MOON The color of this path, Key 18, is red-violet. Let it absorb you and your aura, flooding them through and through. Picture yourself on the path inside the Key, just in front of the towers, facing toward the pool. See the Key in three dimensions. You are on a higher arc mentally, so see yourself as able to look down easily from your location on the path. See the path going downward, and the dog, the wolf, the crayfish, and the pool below you. As you picture yourself seeing this, say to yourself, \"This represents, symbolically, my yesterday. I have come through the waters of consciousness onto the Path, through form after form; controlling, directing, and then evolving the ability to handle the next type of form, unto my present estate of self-conscious humanity, aware of myself as I, reaching consciously toward the beyond that is my destiny. Whatever I have been or done or felt, on the Path, which I have ascended, has been essential to bring me to my present place. I therefore bless it. I bless it!\" This blessing is of what has happened this very day, as well as for what goes back for aeons. This has to do with everything, from the moment you start the exercise, back through all your past, You are performing an exercise in which you bless everything that you have done and been, because whatever it has been, it has been a necessary step toward leading you to where you are. This is one of the best ways to overcome the old habit patterns that keep us fastened to thinking and feeling problems."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER'S: 47 Look upward, at the Radiant Moon, notice the falling Yods, the little flames of fire. Say: \"Vast Consciousness, that has been in charge of my Path of Return, let Thy light shine on me and in me and illumine the further Path that I must travel, so that I will no longer stumble, but go surely to that which is my destiny, the highest reaches of the hills.\" Then see the little flames, the Yods, as coming into you, radiating you, etherealizing your body, taking charge of perfecting it, so that it will be able to reflect the Higher knowing. Now turn around with your back to the pool, and walk through the gateway between the towers to the other side, and continue along the upward path toward the top of the mountain as you say: AFFIRMATION: \"Lord of the universe, keep me traveling towards the height whereon the Hermit stands. Let this instrument of Thyself, my personality, become ever more attuned to Thee, ever more aware of Thee, so that it may express Thy perfect knowing instead of my imperfect understanding. \""}]
