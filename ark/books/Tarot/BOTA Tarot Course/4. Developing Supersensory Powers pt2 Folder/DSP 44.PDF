[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 44 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures With this lesson we take up Tarot Key 17, The Star. The Hebrew letter assigned to this key is Tzaddi. Many of you have read our leaflet on the story of Tzaddi. I will tell you why she was named that. I tell you this story because it shows one meaning of this key in a very dramatic manner; it shows how meditation works in subtle ways even when we do not know that we are meditating. Perhaps this account will make you more alert to the things on which you put your mind, the things you concentrate on, so that you will begin to meditate on more beautiful aspects of life and its manifestations. The story of Tzaddi goes back several years before there was a Tzaddi . . . nine or ten years before she was born. At that time a friend called on me with a little three month-old wirehaired terrier puppy. I took one look at the puppy and wanted him. What could my poor friend do but give him to me? So I had a little dog named Jerry. I hope you will not say, \"Why didn't you give some of this attention and love to children?\" I did. I had a daughter, and I adore children, but there is no reason why we cannot love all of life including little dogs and cats. With all the infinite love that there is in the universe, I think we can manage to love creatures without sacrificing love for each other. Therefore, little Jerry, as you can imagine, had much love from me. As time went by Jerry learned many tricks. He could sit up, play dead dog, open or close the door and carry packages. He was very important to me, my first pet. But there were little drawbacks to Jerry. I didn't really mind them but I told him about them. Being a wirehaired terrier, he had to be brushed a good deal. When I brushed him I would make love to him. He never knew that I said anything that wasn't adoring and flattering, for the tone of my voice wouldn't have indicated it. Yet I would say often to him, \"Jerry, you would be a perfect dog if you were a girl instead of a boy, because when you have amorous inclinations and disappear, I worry about your safety. You would be a perfect dog if your ears were a little longer; yours stick up like a donkey. Also, if the fur around your muzzle were just a bit longer you would have more of a powder puff look. One thing more, when I have to be away for hours I wish you would not be such a gentleman.\" When I came home after having been away for some time, he would scream with discomfort to be let out but he would not be anything but a gentleman in the house. This is wonderful control, but imagine how distressed I would be when I could not get home on time! \"If you would only realize that I would very much rather clean the rug than have you suffer. If you had these few points, then I would say that you were the perfect dog. As it is, you are almost perfect.\" This is the way I spoke to him all of the time, and he acted as though f were complimenting him. Actually I was, in my heart. When I had had Jerry for about seven years, he disappeared tragically. This is one of the ordeals we have to face from time to time. Two and one half years later, when I was with Dr. Case, a very strange episode occurred that has to do with this Tarot Key, as you will see. One day, for no reason that I could understand, from every direction, from infinity, from all around, I found myself permeated with a yearning that had no explanation. Nothing like it had ever happened to me. It was not a human feeling. Something came and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 44 took hold of me. This yearning came from infinity, Usually we experience yearning from within outward. The yearning washed through me in waves, like a fluidic substance. This yearning was for another little dog of my own. I turned to Dr. Case and said, \"I cannot understand this.\" I explained it to him, and he said, \"This is certainly something from the supersensory level whichyou are experiencing. Let us wait and see what develops.\" The yearning persisted, The next day a relative who lived a short distance from us called Dr. Case and said that her dog, Sally, who belonged to Dr. Case originally, was in heat and had been found the day before with a wirehaired terrier and would probably have puppies. Dr. Case comforted her and said, \"Let us wait and see.\" Nine weeks later she called me and said, \"Come and see the new arrivals.\" We walked over. The very last arrival of a litter of five was a runt. She was born on January 28, L945 at 7:00 p.m. I took one look at the runt. Believe me, if anything was not beautiful, she was not\" She did not look at all as she was going to look some day, yet something in my heart went out to her, and something in her went out to me. I took her and held her. When Dr. Case saw how I reacted to her, he said, \"Why don't we take her?\" I said, \"We can't, I have to go to your place to work every day, and I can't carry the puppy back and forth or leave her locked up in my apartment all day!\" Meanwhile he was falling in love with her brother. He said, \"I'll tell you what we'll do. Let's take the two of them to my place. You will be there to care for them in the daytime and you can leave them with me in the evening.\" I did not need much coaxing, so we waited another six weeks. In a thunder storm we went after the puppies, Dr. Case holding one under his rain coat and I holding the other. Romeo was frightened of the thunder and lightening, but Tzaddi had her little nose out and her eyes were as big as stars looking at everything, not minding the beautiful rain drops that looked like diamonds on her little face. She was charmed and intrigued with it all. We named her Tzaddi because she was born on January 28, and this lies in the sign of Aquarius to which this Tarot Key is assigned. I didn't rcalize at the time that she was the result of meditation, but later I remembered the experience I had had, the \"yearning from infinity.\" Therefore, as far as I was concerned, she was certainly tied in with a meditative state. Hence, since this Key is also concerned with meditation, it seemed a doubly appropriate name. Furthermore, anyone could see that she was a Star. When she was three months old, I had a sudden shock, a real revelation, a continuance of the previous experience. Suddenly, as she was prancing around, I saw her for the first time in her new development. She was three months old. When Jerry came to me he was three months old. I saw that she was the image of Jerry except that she was girl instead of a boy; her ears were longer and therefore hung down; the fur about her muzzle was longer and gave her more of a powder puff look\" And believe me, Tzaddi was very indulgent. She was a lady, but she was not going to suffer if I locked her up beyond a certain time. Four points of difference and these were the only differences. She was Jerry reincarnate."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 44 I called my sister and my daughter to come over. I said not a word to them. They practically swooned at the sight of the little dog, for they had known Jerry. They had the shock of recognition. They said, \"She looks exactly like Jerry!\" I said, \"Not exactly; there are four points of difference.\" Now, what happened? Through a period of about seven years I had been saying love words to a little dog I Ioved and holding a picture. This picture was being imbued with love. I had not realized what I was doing, but I was creating an image. Two and a half years after I lost Jerry, the experience of yearning came to me while Tzaddi was being conceived. My thoughts participated in the creation of her form; not the soul, not the spirit. God enfolds the spirit into manifestation, but I participated in my own way in her conception. Note that her mother was a dog that had belonged to Dr. Case; the contact was there and a way was found for me to have this little creature. All of this happened unconsciously on my part; I did not realize any of it until I had the shock of beholding the four points of difference. This extraordinary happening gives us a little more perception, perhaps, into what meditation is and is not. We often hear from elementary metaphysics that anything we want will come if we image it. This is really not true. The principle is true, but the reason that there are so many failures is because the images are built incompletely, with doubt and fear present and are not held long enough. They are not fed the substance of life, which is love. Everyone is in a hurry. We demand that the manifestation come tomorrow or it will be too late. We create through meditation whether we know it or not. Everybhing that we are is a result of meditation. Tarot Key 17 is called Revelation, for revelation emerges from meditation; it is the unveiling of Isis, of Mother Nature. Whenever you see a nude figure in a Key like this one, it implies reality. Reality always has purity and beauty connected with it rather than ugliness that is a product of erroneous thought. A curious thing about Key 17 is the way in which it is connected with Death, Tarot Key 13, by its symbolic name. The Hebrew alphabet is an artificially and deliberately designed alphabet, made to utilize these symbols for meditation and unfoldment of consciousness. It is not like other alphabets. It has come to us from ages past, through those who have gone before us. Every esoteric scholar has studied Qabalah in order to be familiar with the age-old occult teachings, at least as much as he was able to receive, because much has been kept hidden. The association between Key 17 and Key 13 is very important for us to understand. It will strengthen our ability and capacity to meditate and to know what meditation is. I have often had aspirants say, \"I don't think I really know how to meditate. I don't know if I really understand what meditation is.\" I shall try to make it clear to you in these lessons. The meaning of the noun Tzaddi is fish hook. When you remember that the Hebrew letter assigned to Scorpio, Key 13, means fish, you see at once the correlation. Remember what was said about Scorpio. Scorpio, Nun, the Fish, rules the reproductive function. In the Eastern tradition it is considered a truism that the Kundalini enerry is aroused by"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 44 continence, by utilizing the sex force to awaken the Chakras and attain cosmic consciousness. In the Western tradition this is held to be a complete misconception. We consider that the use of the reproductive enerry must be transmuted but not by continence, although all aspirants at times need periods of continence to strengthen the fire for meditation. Meditation uses that fire that abides in all of us, whether or not we realize it. Our ability to concentrate uses that fire, which, on the physical plane, is the reproductive force. Because most people have developed guilt complexes, lewd thoughts and feelings and misconceptions about the sexual act itself, they have in essence put clothes on Mother Nature, on Truth. The result is that the ability to attain to high states of real Cosmic Consciousness in meditation is lost rather than gained. This happens with some people who use continence as a method for conserving the force because they look on the act of union as an evil thing, as unspiritual, as something to evolve away from. If such a person has a psychic organism, he will have all manner of psychic experiences, because he is repressing a force that must come out in some way. It comes out in many other ways too, of course, but the one that we must realize here is that it can burst through on psychic levels instead of energizing the higher supersensory levels where we have control. Psychic levels are the states of the lower astral. Often they are obsessional, Some who have such psychic experiences think that they have attained to lofty levels of awareness. They delude themselves and too often try to persuade others to follow their delusion. Such schools pass on a teaching which derides that which God created for the reproduction of vehicles and the con',inuing of the life of the soul and spirit. If we heed bhis view, if we permit these complexes to stay with us, we interfere gravely with our attainment of the higher levels of Cosmic Consciousness. Tarot Key 16, The Tower, from which the figures are thrown, is assigned to Mars. Astrologically, Mars rules the sex drives as well as the volitional drives. The lightning strikes the tower of Babel, built by misconceptions, by dirty minds. The heart that knows how to love will see the beauty of union as being the universal expression of divine love and therefore will hold this function sacred, so sacred that there will be no danger that he will promiscuously use something so revered and beautiful. The flower is the sex organ of the plant, and it is beauty incarnate. Therefore, beauty is one of the ideas assigned to this key in a subtle way. Tzaddi is the fish hook, the fish hook that captures the fish. Meditation, the higher meditation, is the state of wanting something beautiful, with love as the motivating agent. It is not merely sitting. Some people have the idea that meditation is only a time to sit and knit the brows and say, \"This is my meditation period.\" A heart at peace breathes rhythmically. Meditation is walking on the street, looking at a tree, seeing the beaufy that the Lord hath wrought. Do you think this is not meditation? God keeps the universe going through the seeing and feeling aspects of centers of ltself, ourselves and all other living beings. When we achieve the ability to look for beauty because of the capacity to love, then we are learning what real meditation is. Then, when we have our periods of what we might call formal meditation, they will be used in a very specialized manner, like the meditation that created Tzaddi."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 44 The difference between informal meditation and formal meditation is that we have set periods for formal meditation. Because of them, our informal meditations become more and more closely aligned with God's consciously meditated universe, with the unveiling of nature, with the experience of beautSr, with the knowledge of life, with the understanding of the significance of the mind and perception of the power of consciousness. But this can be only when we extend the formal meditative period out into informal meditative periods, into the living of our lives. Unless we do this, we miss the opportunity of obtaining liberation in higher awareness. You cannot expect to see through the appearance, to see the reality, to see beyond if something in you is not fishing from the higher level all of the time. Tzaddi is the fish hook. The meditation state is, in a sense, a state of fishing, a state of scanning for the reality behind every event and contact in our lives. This week try to see the hand of God in every occurrence, every form that you encounter. Do not restrict meditation to a set period. Practice meditation while you are working or playing or resting. This practice will not only increase your understanding and awareness of reality, it will also open up a new world of beauty before your eyes."}]
