[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 37 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In the Book of Tokens, in the meditation on Key 13, we read of the Great Deep, the Mother Sea, and of the fish swimming in the Great Sea. \"Fish\" is the meaning of the Hebrew letter Nun assigned to Key 13 and here used as a noun. But as a verb, Nun means to propagate. Propagation takes place in the Great Deep of the Mother, in the fluid of the great womb, cosmically speaking, as well as in the aspect of the Cosmic Mother that is the individual female. As above, so below. The syrmbolism is exact. When I was a small child I had, every night of my life, a very special experience. I always knew when it was coming. I would find myself floating in the infinite ocean, this strange ocean of the Mother Deep. The experience began when I was about five at the time that I was brought within the aura of Dr. Case by the Master. It always came after I had finished a particular time of meditation, I would say my prayers with the rest of the household. Being in a language I did not understand, they were just words. Still, I felt holy about them because they were prayers. Afterwards I would end by blessing whoever and whatever I wanted to. That part was the preliminary, but the real meditation came later. I would begin to analyze my life, going over its details, wondering and reaching for an answer I did not get. I would ask myself, \"Am I glad that I was born?\" I asked it of myself very seriously. I searched to see if there were enough compensations for birth and as often as not I was not sure that there were. Then I would begin to think of the future. I would say, \"Well, I'm only five.\" I would begin to look ahead and see all kinds of possibilities. I was unconsciously using the Imaginative Intelligence associated with this key and this letter and all of the ideas that bear on what I have discussed, My imagination would project possibilities, and these possibilities seemed so wonderful and lovely that I would say, \"Yes, in view of that, I am glad that I was born.\" Later something happened that made me far more than glad: I decided that I was perfect! I gazed at my hair, my face, my body, my eyes, and I fell completely in love with myself because I was so perfect! I was a miracle of perfection. This overwhelmed me. After I experienced this, I worked up a happiness within myself of anticipation over what would be someday, when I was grown. Then I would feel a vibration coming to me, and it always came at a right angle to wherever I was. It is interesting to find the right angle of approach mentioned by Di. Case in the lessons on Tarot Key 20, the fourth dimensional consciousness. I would feel the vibration approach and enter all of my vehicles. Instantly I was changed from a child in my bed, watching the stats, to a consciousness floating in an infinite ocean, but not an ocean like other oceans. It had qualities. It was a fluidic substance made up of love, peace and bliss. In this I floated like a fish in the vast, beginningless, endless ocean of infinity. It did not merely surround me; it was part of me, It filled me and bathed me in love and bliss. It was evenly rhythmic, like a dance. It held me every night."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 37 In the mornings I would think, \"Isn't it strange! There are two states of consciousness that are reall the waking state and my ocean state. The state that is unreal is the dream state.\" This I knew from my own experience. I was bewildered and wondered, \"How can I float in the ocean and not be wet?\" I could not understand it, but I knew that it was so and that it was real. Much later the experience began to recede from me. It skipped first a day then two, then a week. Gradually it stopped. I never experienced it again in that way. Instead I experienced something more on a conscious level, another kind of experience, after I had entered into the study of Tarot and Qabalah. I knew that this fluidic ocean was real, and later when I studied Jung I read his account of the return to the womb of the mother. The Freudian school has tried to interpret this as an attempt to escape from reality. Certain occult schools of thought coax you to come to Nirvana where there is peace, love and bliss. Float in the ocean of serenity for eternity! It was because I was able to bathe in this love, peace and bliss that I lived. I could never have survived my childhood without it. This I know, I also know that we are all bathed in it, though few are aware of it as I was. I was aware of it because it was my destiny to have to do certain things, to be a channel for B.O.TA. and for others who come our way. Hence I needed a certain kind of discipline and training. Is this experience of the Mother Deep, the ocean of love, peace and bliss something that we should work for? We will achieve it without working for it if we learn how to utilize the enerry that we already have. When we say energ/, we mean Kundalini. Too many aspirants think only about having positive thoughts about their jobs and neighbors. They do nst reali:aâ‚¬ that they must begin to think with l-.eauty and holiness about the very energ/ that gave them their vehicle, their life, their evolution into consciousness, which is the reproductive enerry, the Kundalini. This we have twisted and contorted with wrong usage, with concentration in expressing it only on the physical plane--though physical plane expression certainly is not in itself evil. Whatever we have done in the past, we must be willing to say, \"It is finished.\" See the reaper on the key. We have been reaping rewards through change. This Key has to do with change. for change is always death to the former situation. Here you have the woman and the man as part of what is being reaped. It symbolizes the Cosmic Mother and Father, the Cosmic Female and Cosmic Male. The Cosmic Female, Qabalistically, is called Understanding. The Cosmic Male, Qabalistically, is called Wisdom. From the experiences, even from misuses and abuses, we reap understanding and wisdom. The hands show what we have accomplished. All of this motion is involved with karma, both the growths and the consequences, though it is shown subtly. Whatever we have done, thought or felt, it is useless to waste our energies castigating ourselves. We must be willing to see what we have gained in wisdom; to reap our wisdom, reap our understanding as is being done here in order to walk into the sunrise, to walk forward not backward to our next experience, or to illumination and enlightenment. The skeleton reaps with a scythe that symbolizes the moon. The energr of the moon is closely involved in the functions represented by this key. The moon is the subconsciousness. Hence we have discussed purifying the subconsciousness, getting rid of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 37 all the nonsense of yesterday. The white rose means purified desire. Purified desire is not absence of desire. A man who loves a woman desires her. A woman who loves a man desires him. It means that the desire is looked upon as something holy, something beau- tiful, something from on high, as a drive to the expression of unity, oneness, with the beloved. The force is seen with the eyes of beauty and holiness--this is the difference. When one has truly attained that capacity, if he needs further instruction he will receive it because it is available, although not too many know about it. One thing you must always avoid like the plague is the love cult of pseudo-occultism. These tear down their members spiritually and psychically with misinterpretations about the use of the sex force that might sound logical but are more damaging to the soul than anything else. This is not the way in which you will receive your extra instructions, From time to time, something of this is given in your lessons. The real esoteric aspects are given nowherel they always have been and will always be something very private for those who are ready. Do not feel that we are deliberately not giving you something that you need to know. You do not need it. Only what you can use do you need. We will give you this when you are in a position to use properly what there is to be given. You are now working in the most important way that there is to work, purifying your consciousness, your desire naturel striving to have a different emotional response to an enerry which has the most tremendous driving power in the universe. It also has the most driving power in the mass mind. You are, therefore, rvorking against the strongest impact of the mass mind when you try to bring an idealistic and beautiful attitude to this eners/. It has nothing to do with whether you are single or married. There is nothing more unwholesome than repressing an enersr and saying that one is too spiritual to feel it. It then becomes a psychic cancer. This is not spirituality. To say that you are too spiritual to feel desire for your beloved is to say that the desire for union is ugly and unspiritual. This is one of the ideas you have to transmute. As you perfect the right attitude, you will find that more information will come your way as to what to do next. A very interesting book that bears on this topic is worth mentioning. It does not give the answer, for the author is completely biased toward a very specialized expression of union, yet in spite of all this he has a grain of something useful for you. The book is Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness, by Dr. Rudolph Von Urban, and the greatest contribution he makes is in pointing out that there is such a thing as an electromagnetic interchange experienced in intercourse by those who are emotionally ready and willing to work to evolve that awareness in themselves. This is not to be had through the usual attitudes toward union. Those of you who have a fear of physical death should use this key to bring into your consciousness an awareness that the death of the old is life to the new, whether it be in terms of the physical body or a condition or situation. The sun is always rising for your consciousness, no matter what happens to your body or the body of anyone you love. Death is being born anew. Being born anew means death. This is the secret of eternity, a foreverness. Forms pass but that which experiences forms goes on forever."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 37 Change is the miracle, reaping all of the rewards of purified desire, wisdom and understanding. This will help us to have less fear. We should also try to feel this attitude more strongly in our hearts, to begin to look for every indication we can find of the holiness, the beaufy and sanctity of union. We should discover it in the meeting of two cloudlets. We should think of it when starlight strikes us and realize that its rays are so powerful that they go through us, so that we are permeated and united. Through telepathy this principle of unity exists between all individuals on the mental levels. Telepathy is the unification of streams of thought. Unity exists on the emotional levels, whenever anyone has a sudden rush of feeling or emotion for another. The principle of unity and love is thus expressed. It is expressed wherever we look. Unity is eve4rwhere, no matter how much we seem isolated in our self-consciousness. Unity is always present because God is One with God. If we begin to see this unity in all things and bring that realization down to the physical function \". . . we shall see thatthe act of unionbetween husband and wife is an expression of this all-permeating unity and is therefore deserving of the same poetry and inspiration, the same worship. That is the greatest secret of all, if you but knew it, Unity IS. Let us try to find it in places where we have not looked for it before and thus deepen our awareness of it.\" TECHNTQUE FOR TAROT KsY NO. 13. DEATH The eolor of the path ef this Tarot key i* blue-green. Perrseate yourself and your aura with this color. Levitate yourself to stand in the Tarot key between the heads of the man and the woman. Think of the skeleton behind you as being the spirit of change, which means death to the old and life to the new. Mentally look down at the elements that are being reaped: the hands, the foot, the two heads. Picture the rising sun as sending out a beam of light into you, permeating you with the blessings of what is to come while it cleanses you and brings you the richness of reward from the reapings of what has been. AFFIRNIATION: I welcome change in all its forms and aspects. I reap understanding and wisdom\" I reap the ability to see the essential beauty in all forms of union. I reap the capacity for proper action; to be forever born anew. The motion of life is the Divine Urge that leads me towards conscious awareness of my immortality"}]
