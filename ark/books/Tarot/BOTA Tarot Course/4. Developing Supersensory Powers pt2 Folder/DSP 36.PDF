[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 36 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures This week we will work with Tarot Key 13, Death, attributed to the Hebrew letter Nun. The symbolism of this key holds one of the most profound secrets of occultism. I cannot reveal to you all the esoteric aspects involved because you are not ready to control the power that is released by full knowledge of this secret. You are being prepared, however, to have the ability to handle energies that, manipulated properly, are the secrets of life, and manipulated improperly are the secret of what we call death, though even death is truly a service to life\" I have given out more of this secret, as far as I know, than has ever been given heretofore. I have been criticized by some for this and blessed by others. This is usually the case with unfamiliar ideas that do not agree with popular attitudes or preconceptions we hold, not only from our current life but also from other incarnations. In these lessons we will give you the beginnings of the secret. If what we have to say startles or shocks you, please continue to love us and try to assume that it might make sense later. Do not turn your backs too quickly on what we have to say. In occult training, there is no such thing as a single lesson. One example can give you nothing. Occult training is like learning to walk. If you had been shown how to walk only once, would you ever have learned? Everything is learned through repetition. We try to provide the repetition in different directions, from different approaches, so that the matter seems new. All of the repetitions are directed toward developing new circuits, so to speak, in your brain structure, new convolutions to make your vehicle an instrument through which more intensive and higher states of consciousness can be expressed and experienced, This is the way of all growth. No single lecture or lesson can grow you. It can, however, point your mind in the right direction by projecting an idea, an attitude or an emotion. Death is pictured here as both a beginning and an end. The sun is not setting but rising. Yet here is what looks like the Grim Reaper, the skeleton which symbolizes Death. As Dr. Case points out in earlier lessons, anyone who knows his anatomy, any artist, must be perplexed by the configuration of this skeleton and think that occultists must be very ill informed or careless. They know that a skeleton does not look like the one in Key 13. This figure has two twists in its spine which even a contortionist could not reproduce. There is a twist in the spine at the point of the physical location of the chakra that we call the Mars center, a chakra associated with the sex eners/. There is also a twist in the neck. Those who suffer from a stiff neck might wonder if the figure is not uncomfortable. The twist in the ne'ck indicates a change of direction in the energies which flow up the spinal column from the Mars center, the sex energies, The reason for the twist at the throat is because at the throat is the Venus center, and Venus is love as well as Creative Imagination. Likewise, Mars is the volitional enerry as well as the sex enerry. Venus and Mars are lovers in mytholory. In Qabalah they are complements in color (green and red) and position on the Tree of Life. Their interrelationship is highlighted in many ways. We see here a picture of beginning and of ending. It is also a picture of a new departure. The seed in the upper left hand corner is the seed of life, the seed that is life's"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER'S: 36 eternal beginning. The contrast of beginning and end is most appropriate to this key, because Key 13 is assigned to Scorpio, the ruler of the eighth house of the Zodiac, the house assigned todeath and inheritance. This key has another assignation as well. Each of the Tarot keys rules a part of the body, and Scorpio rules the reproductive organs. That attribution is probably the reason why some orthodox astrologers have been antagonistic toward Scorpians as a whole. Humanity has just begun to emerge from a very long period of puritanism and prurience, of having a dirty mind. What the mind thinks of as dirty, 19 dirty to that person. it ir d\"t\"r*ined by the consciousness whether a thing is thought of as holy and sacred or lewd and unclean. Therefore we treat a situation or a person in the way that our consciousness basically regards it. This era of puritanism is but slowly receding. We must work to change our negative attitudes toward tlie sex enerry. It is our response that matters! In relation to the whole reproductive function and to death, warped attitudes are still rampant in the race mind. Some people wonder why death is assigned to a sign of the Zodiac and to a Tarot key that symbolizes the reproductive function, and why in any case such a macabre figure is used io represent that which idealistically should be thought of in terms of beauty. The expression of the sex force as man has known it has been destructive' It has been said that \".'Lry union with the spouse is a little death. The implications of this statement are in- tereiting, but it does not mean that the application of the reproductive function, the act of urrign beiweeii niale and female is proCuctive cf death. To say that' would be going the way of some of our eastern brothers who insist that the attainment of adepthood requires celibacy. Many of the celibates of the Eastern Tradition and many in the Western Tradition are fillld with guilt stemming from their own discolored attitudes and feelings toward sex. They think, erroneously, that they are evil in having drives of this kind. Many an aspirant follows this repressive practice. Their problem is one of misunderstanding the whole issue. The implications of sex in esoteric occultism are essential. Even our Eastern brothers tell us that the Kundalini, the serpent force that rises up the spine and awakens us, is the same force that, coiled at the base of the spine, is the driving energy behind sex union and reproduction. This is easily perceived by any student who has an understanding of the more subtle energies. From this perception, however, many doctrines have developed. One school says that man will ultimately evolve to a stage where sex will no longer be necessary for reproduction--or even possible. Human progeny will be produced by division (like protozoans) or by budding, like coelenterates. It is surprising how many take this idea seriously. It is an idea typical of the aspirant who feels he \"teceived it from on high.\" Many sincere aspirants are quite psychic or become psychic before going through the pt.li*ir,ury disciplines. What comes in psychically washes through their subconscious. Subconsciousness is the channel of and for everything! That is why we strive so to clear our subconsciousness so that what comes from the Higher will be reflected purely, without colorations of our own conditionings. Almost everything that we apprehend consciously or unconsciously is colored by our own culture symbols. All of these things enter into and influence the psychic vision or sound, The result is some extraordinary"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 36 3 messages but not at all in accordance with reality, because they have been mixed with our private nonsense. We, of the Builders of the Adytum, have given you more than one technique to help transmute this. By working with Tarot alone, even if you used no techniques but meditation, you would gradually clear your subconscious. That is one of the miracles of Tarot. It helps you to transmute. Pronouncements of the kind given above, namely, that sex is wicked and unclean, come from a consciousness steeped in erroneous conditioning. If one holds such a view even subconsciously, his concept of the spiritual state is naturally going to exclude something he considers ugly and low. One cannot, however, avoid the uncomfortable fact that we must still give birth to the various elements in life, so they consciously fall back on the one-celled creature that reproduces by division. They go backward instead of forward! It is sad indeed that human beings have such attitudes toward what should be thought of as the most sacred energy in the universe, the energr that is used for union and for reproduction of the species. Let us throw a little light on its nature and purpose to help us do something with our own basic enerry. It is essential for us to change our attitude toward that energr, for this is the eners/ that brings spiritual experience, illumination, and union with the Higher Self. This is the enerry that gives the capacity to love children, brothers, friends, spouses, clouds, trees, etc. This is the energy that gives the ability to do all of this. That is why it is so important. If you have this tremendous enerry twisted and contorted in knots of guilt, if you have interpreted it to yourself as foul, you cannot use it for spiritual development. We admit that people have often used the sex force foully; there is no denying that. But what has been done with it is beside the point. Water is a wonderful essential to life, but consider what misuse can be made of it. It can be mixed with poison, it can be befouled. Water that comes down clear and o-eautiful from the melted snows of the mountain top can be contaminated by insecticides, detergents and radio-active wastes so that fish die or suffer genetically. One must recognize the difference between what an enerry is and how it has been used. How an ener$/ is used depends on the consciousness and the heart of the creature using it, its evolution, its perception, its insight and its control. To be really human is to know how to use the inhibitory faculties constructively, positively. Only human consciousness can deliberately inhibit or discipline anything in any area. To be spiritually human at the higher levels is to be and to do just that. More than once we have been told by the Master and more than once you have read elsewhere that one of the most vital things for an aspirant to do is to change his or her attitude toward this basic procreating enerry and all that surrounds it. What is this change of attitude? One man who took up the study of Buddhism developed the idea that since according to Buddhism all life is really one, there was no need to choose or discriminate in choice; let alone inhibit oneself as to who or what one sought unity with. \"Why be a monogamist?\" he thought. This type of reasoning is the exact opposite of the practice of the unity of life. His idea of the way to achieve all-over cosmic awareness was to seek union wherever his inclination moved him to seek it. This was a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 36 fantastic rationalization. The beautiful ideal of cosmic union was rationalized by this man into condoning his need to be promiscuous. He apparently interpreted the ideal concept of sex as an ecstatic mass union. Thus he saw no need to utilize the disciplining factors, the conscious human factors of control and direction in order to attain to higher and more divine states of awareness, perception and power. He who learns truly to direct and control this amazing reservoir of the living cosmic source of all life, the reproductive energy, has the power to heal, to project, to perform miracles. It is the most fantastic and incredible of all the powers of human consciousness, and the most difficult to control. That is why when we come to the appropriate key we try to bring to you a reahzation of what the first few steps are toward that control. Your first essential step is to change your attitude toward that expression of enerry, rather than continue to see it as man has through so many unhappy ages. You must consider it objectively, without havingyour heart and emotions twist and turn because of past unhappy experiences. It is not easy at first. Past experiences wash in and bring pain and keep one from seeing what the principle really is and how one must work at feeling it within liir o*n being. Yet this is the first essential step to attainment of any true state of spiritual power. The attitude has to be one of unity with life. Certainly, no one can argue against the fact that all investigation, all mystical experience, points to the unity of life. We, of course' are individualized centers for this unity. Male and female, in this stage of evolution, are in e s€nse each half; the masculine portraying one element of the cosmic drive and the feminine the other. Not that we are not really both within ourselves, but in this stage of our evolution we have not attained to the use of both drives equally well or we should be something far beyond what we are. Polarity is present until we reach the very highest levels of evolution, Even God, if you will think back to Genesis, expresses within Itself polarity. \"And the Elohim said . . .\" Elohim was later translated \"The Lord God.\" But the word Elohim is a feminine noun with a masculine plural ending. It means \"The conjoined male and female spirit of God.\" The Elohim said, \"Let us beget.\" Does that not sound different? Even in the creation of the universe, if we look into the esoteric teachings we find that God is not He; God is He and She in union. That is why, on the Tree of Life, Key 3, the path of Venus, connects the Cosmic Mother and the Cosmic Father; they are eternally coqjoined. This Tarot Key 13 also expresses unity. If you add the letters of the Hebrew word for unity, Achad, they total 13; and if you add the letters of the Hebrew word for love, Ahebah, they also total 13. Love and unity are shown in this key. This is the outer face it has for us in our unevolved state until we look a little further. Remember that God, as an aspect of ltself, creates and reproduces our children and our children's children through the act of unity, and that both aspects of God enter into the Elohim. Thus if God sees fit to reproduce the species through the act of love and unity, should we not hold this act in reverence? Should we not see it as the most sacred act there is, whether it be between husband and wife or between two little birds?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 36 5 We know how most people look upon it. We know the things that are said of it, the vulgar speech. Have you not, too, at one time or another participated in snickering, sharing of a desecrating idea? We have. We did not know any better. Let us not judge ourselves, caught as we were in the mass mind. We do not, however, ag?ee with the Eastern Tradition that an aspirant should become a celibate. Keep this clearly in mind. It is true that some aspirants at certain stages require a short period of celibacy for added power. When such a time comes, there are usually other conditions to show it, and he knows. This is in no wise giving up something low, vulgar or ugly in order to flrnd God. It is simply a matter of conserving power for a specific purpose. He who divorces himself completely from the act of unity in a real sense divorces himself from life. When we say divorces himself from unity, we do not mean by that his being unmarried. There is nothing wrong with living alone. We are talking about an attitude. It is the attitude of the mind and heart that is involved here, not what the karma happens to be at any given time. It is your attitude of mind and heart that keeps you tied to death, the death of your hopes, ideals, dreams and aspirations. You will be continuously reborn, of course. What we want to do, however, is to conquer death, and we want to do it in more ways than one. /. You realize by now that when we drop the physical body, we are not dead. I can give you assurance that I have had complete evidence of the survival of memory and consciousness after death. The dropping of the physical vehicle is but an incident in the survival of consciousness which is the real liver and experiencer in and through the vehicle. This you may be well aware of, but if you have still some lingering emotional doubt or reservation, in these lessons we will give you a few examples of veriflred events in relation to survival. There are many excellent books in the field of scientific psychic research. Our Grand Prolocutor, F. J. Frazer, has been for many years a researcher in this realm. That is what brought him into occultism. There are many good books to read, but please do not experiment until you have attained a true transmutation of your subconscious patterns, Playing about with psychic forces can be dangerous. It can pull you downward into lower levels rather than help you upward. You do not need to experiment with dangerous energies because working in the way of the initiate as you are doing, you receive all of these experiences from the higher level, from the supersensory levels. You receive the proof without having to dip yourself into the lower vibrations. You receive it in a most satisfactory way. You experience yourself as being eternal and immortal. After that, no one can ever tell you that you were ever born or that you will ever die."}]
