[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS Lesson 21 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures After your last lesson you may well wonder what to do at the times when you have problems. How may valid answers from your Inner Teacher be distinguished from fraudulent ones coming from discarnate entities or delusioned ideas from self- rationalization? Many have come to me with problems. One thing I have never done is to tell anyone what to do, even though she or he may have been disappointed at this apparent lack of guidance. I should have broken my most sacred obligation had I done so. Every time we try to directly influence someone and that someone blindly and indiscriminately heeds us, we have taken away that much strength from his soul, that much experience from his spirit, that much growth and expansion from his consciousness. This does not mean that you should not offer advice to those who come to you in distress. Nor should we permit our love for another to diminish if the advice we offer is not accepted. What we are talking about is the attempt to push or force advice upon someone, advice which will rob him of his own evaluation and judgment. There are times when we have great problems and do not know what to do or where to turn. What we need more than anything at these times is someone to cling to who will not sit in judgment no matter what we have done. We need someone who will listen with sympathy to what we say and give us a chance to express ourselves, so that we can begin to look at the problem objectively, with the issues clearly defined. By sharing the problem with someone else, it helps us to obtain the objective view. There is an inner telepathic rapport when you talk to someone who has the ability to be a true counsellor. Just by virtue of talking about the problem to one who has that inner spiritual quality, you take the first step towards its solution. Some people have this quality of the true counsellor without realizing that they have it. The ability to look objectively at the problem gives us the capacity to use the reasoning faculty (The Emperor). If we have no one to come to, no one with whom to discuss the problem, thereby helping us to view it more objectively, we are often caught in a vicious circle like a squirrel in a cage going around and around. Such counseling helps us to get out of a trap. True counseling creates the atmosphere which helps you to accept yourself, no matter what you are or what you have done. The spiritual counsellor does not (even subconsciously) condemn you but holds you in love, which opens your own channels to the knowledge of what to do next. There is always the question of what Tarot key will be the best and most helpful for a particular problem. This advice we give freely always, in letters, in classes, etc. This is counseling that really helps. When you go through a problem, using the principles of the Tarot; when you have solved that problem you will be able to say, \"I have grown. I have been able to perceive a principle, I understand the way or part of the way in which consciousness works.\" You will not then fall into that particular trap as readily as before."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 21 You have noticed, I am sure, how often problems repeat themselves. If we have the habit of falling in love with someone who will reject us, we do it regularly. If we have the habit of making business alliances with one who will betray us, we do it regularly. We keep having the same experiences, because we have not yet come to perceive the principle of the underlying problem. We have not learned how to bring that problem to the Inner Teacher, the Inner Instructor. The main thing we have omitted doing, of course, is what this Tarot key, The Hierophant, shows so clearly in the two kneeling flrgures. The one with the white lilies represents our knowledge, and the one with the red roses represents our desire nature; they symbolize our hearts and our minds, intellect and feeling, knowledge and desire, and all that goes with them. They are wearing garments patterned as a yoke; they are kneeling. The greatest problem you have--and one this Tarot key will help you overcome--is to learn how to put your knowledge and your desire aside to assume, symbolically, the kneeling position. Most of your troubles stem from the belief in things that you know are not so and wishing for things which are not in harmony with the universal desire drive. Arriving at the heart of the problem, whatever the problem appears to be, requires before all things your willingness to remove the enchanting shackles of the intellect and to give up the fixed emotions you have enmeshed yourself in--to place these facets of your personality aside, at least for the time being. Of course, you will not be able to maintain this conditionl we are all growing children. Before utilizing the practice to solve a particular problem, at least in the area of concern, we must be willing to say, \"I know that much of my thinking is based cn false interprctations frcrn thc past. I knor','that many of my' feelings are based cn incorrect evaluations and that my acceptance of incorrect values from the past is what feeds negative emotions. I know this, and I'm willing to let you, O Lord of Life, transmute my thinking and my feeling.\" It is quite an achievement to be willing to say this, for it takes true humility. You usually have to be desperately unhappy before you are willing to give up the false interpretations of experience that cause all of the trouble. Flemember, too, in spirituality, humor is essential. Without it, you lose your way, If you cannot laugh with God, you have not reached God. Just as we laugh with our children, think how God must laugh with us. Realize the importance of laughter, use its therapy--it will aid you in bringingyour true intuition into proper focus. Usually it is whenyou need your intuition the most, that you become so emotionally concerned that intuition is blocked. That is why I have stressed the importance of relaxing the emotions, the desires, the think- ing processes and giving your problems to the Higher Self. Now this does not mean that we do not use the thinking and feeling processes. The faculties represented by the Tarot keys preceding the Hierophant must be utilized. First of all, be the Fool, with a sense of adventure. Be willing to see your journeyings into self-experience in a new unique manner. Be the Adventurer (Superconsciousness). Next, practice being the Magician, Tarot Key 1. Observe alertly; be willing to look at reality, to concentrate on the living moment. Then be the High Priestess, Key 2; be willing and able to recollect everything that is involved with what you have observed; utilize your memory, your recollections. Then go to Tarot Key 3, The Empress, using attention and recollection to creatively imagine all possible solutions, for the Empress is creative imagination. Finally, use Tarot Key 4, reason. Reason the problem through; weigh it, measure it, see what"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 21 3 avenues show practical potential. Every great scientist has had to follow this same procedure which dates back to the dawn of time and before recorded history. When, even with application of all your reason, you find that you cannot reach a pro- per solution, only then do you arrive at a point where you are prepared, ready and willing to kneel and ask for help from on High, from your Higher Teacher, from your true inner self. Kneel. Give up what you think is so. Be willing to give up the fixed and rigid determinations that have made you insist that only one solution to your problem is possible. You must be willing to let go of what you think must be, or else you will not be receptive to the true solution. How does the true intuitive solution come? It can come in many ways. The first requirement, in a sense, is simply to SHUT UP! We are forever chattering with our minds and our emotions, and while this goes on, how are we able to hear that silent Voice of the higher knowing? We must be willing to let go with our mind, to quiet our thoughts and emotions, to give in. It is a sacrifice and a discipline, but we have climbed to the point where we should be capable of sacrifice in order to have something better and more wonderful. It is a strange thing, the way in which human consciousness hangs doggedly to that which was. At the heart of most of our problems is this unbending determination to hang on to the past and to hold it in the present, desperately trying to make it appear again in the future. We must, then, release ourselves from this attempt to equate past, present and future. The secret in successful meditation, the purposeful reception and perception of real intuitional guidance, is so simple that people hardly believe it and seldom practice it; it is that easy. The trick is to LISTEN! It is that simple. It is an alert listening, however, not mere passive inertness. Many people go passive and wonder why nothing happens. Others with psychic vehicles permit the invasion of all kinds of astral nonsense, because their passive minds are open to anything that will come in. This is not the way to receive intuitional and spiritual guidance at all. You have to keep your own center of consciousness alert. There is a little trick to it. You must let go of mental and emotional blocks and be willing to accept the truth as symbolized by the kneeling figures in Tarot Key 5. Keep the kneeling figures in mind and what they symbolize, and at the same time, listen as though you hear something afar off. A sudden attention of listening is what we mean. Suppose you were alone in a house and thought you heard a footstep. Wouldn't every atom of your being spring suddenly to attentive listening? Isn't it just as important to give that same attention to the Higher Self? You combine a letting go and an opening up, a positive opening up, because you are listening to and for your Higher Self, the Interior Teacher. When you have a serious problem of any kind, go through the preliminary steps first (TarotKeys 0 through4). You are notreadyuntil thento hearthe InnerVoice. If you try to listen before you have used your other faculties, you will receive no dependable answer. Your whole being must be involved; you cannot dismiss or disregard your intellect, your attention or your memory. You must use all your faculties before you have the right, before you can expect higher help, Every great scientist has admitted this; that in making a great discovery, and after using all of his other faculties to solve the problem, suddenly there is a jump of consciousness and a higher perception of underlying principles. Sometimes it comes pouring in, and sometimes one seems to reach up to find the solution."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 21 Descriptions, however, are almost identical as to what precedes the influx of the new principles. A personal problem is just as much a problem of research as the research of a scientist. This research includes the use of the Tarot because the Tarot is a spiritual, self-analytical system designed for transmuting all of your old karma into a new being. To the degree that you accept your responsibility to work on transmutation, to that degree are you going to receive more of the kind of life that you want. The listening does not necessarily mean that an actual voice will be heard. Dr. Case actually heard a voice a good part of the time. There are others who receive the visualization telepathically. There are some who receive it as a complete knowing conviction, without question. There are still others who receive it as a visual sSrmbol. The point is, that you will know that you have achieved the highest level of communication and intuition when your answer comes as a p1i4ciplg. I will give you an example, The first time I decided to test the theory that answers to problems can come from higher spiritual levels, I decided to go about it exactly as I have described above. My problem was, to me, a very serious one: I have always felt a profound emotional disturbance over the social situation in the world--babies born sick and poor: horrorsl sadnessl injustice; all this bothered me. This sadness included the little creatures, not just human beings. Why there should be this kind of a world worried me very much, After I came into occultisrn and starteC tc study the lav;s of evofution in terrrrs of occult teachings, the idea of bloodshed as an aspect of evolution horrified me. I have always been opposed to violence of any kind. It therefore worried me that the magnificent and glorious democracy which we call the United States of America should have been founded on a revolution, in which killing was involved. I have always been sensitive to pain in life, and that any good could come from violence was something I could not seem to accept in my heart. I decided to ask for an answer. \"How,\" I asked myself, \"could anythinggood come out of something preceded by violence?\" The fact that the American Revolution had to be fought was undeniable, but the necessit5i for killing seemed to me an indication that something was wrong with the way evolution works. I had to get my answer. It is very hard to live in a world when you are sensitive to even the pain of a little fly. I reviewed in my mind the various books I had read on sociolog', economics, politics, on the way things had developed and evolved in our social structurel what one side had to say and what the other had to say. I reviewed these ideas and meditated for approximately one hour, when suddenly my whole consciousness was transported and I became the Principle of Evolution. This, of course, was one of the highest states of direct perception and most unusual. In this state, there was within me a beginninglessness and endlessness; not within me, Ann Davies, but within me, the All Self. I could see evolution taking place like a crowd of people in a river, a very strong, rushing, deep river, rushing to the sea with rocks and waterfalls on the way and people swept this way and that, dashed to pieces. In that state I saw the utter unimportance of what happened to the individual bodies, blindly smashed against the rocks and stones, being catapulted over the waterfalls, for they were all"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 21 and stones, being catapulted over the waterfalls, for they were all inevitably being carried by an inexorable current as a force of evolution out to the infinite sea. The sea was a symbol of their whole humanhood, their full consciousness, their illumination, their fullness of being. Their final goal being the inevitable brotherhood of man which embraces the oneness of Being. For me to have such an experience was overwhelming. I still cringe at stepping on an ant or swatting a fly. I naturally still love everything and every creature that lives and feel protective toward them in every way. In this cosmic experience I became the principle of evolution, and from that time on I possessed the sure knowledge that everSrbhing that lives, ever5rthing that exists, no matter what the surface appearance, even though we still have bloodshed, war, earthquakes, devastations, all life is destined to the perfection of unity with God. The experience left me with an abiding peace, a faith in the glorious destiny of all that lives, despite the inevitable pains and sorrows of incarnate life. This underlying peace lives with me as vividly today as during the time of my actual participation in the Divine Intention. I now rcalize that the evolutionary process includes dissolution of the old as a preliminary to building the new. The old becomes the sand for the mortar of progress. In the above experience, the problem I meditated on brought me the answer which was in exactly the same field to which the question related. Almost everyone has, at one time or another, had a problem which he analyzed, found insoluble with his conscious mind, then frnally entered into the position of the supplicants in Tarot Key No. 5 and reached for help from on High. Then suddenly comes some kind of realization or some unexpected understanding of the principle. By understanding the principles, you know how to use your own mind and how to proceed. This is the real intuitive guidance and help. If there are obstacles, they will not concern you. You know that they are there only to be overcome. The thing to remember is that intuition, most of the time, comes as certain conviction. Know your levels. It is not that you might not get some very good pointers from other minds broadcasting, but know to what level you are tuning, so that you are not deceived. Know that whenever you have a sudden opening up in your consciousness, or perception of a principle, at that point you have reached the highest interior teaching, whether you have consciously been aware of contact with the Higher Self or not. The very sudden opening up of the understanding of the principle shows that you achieved your answer. You will never be at a loss for action in terms of the particular problems governed by that principle. Having this concept discussed in this manner will help you to watch for it. Remember that whatever you watch for is what you develop; whatever you work for is what you finally achieve. That is why it is necessary to understand the different levels of consciousnessl to understand that which is psychic (and this can be interesting, entertaining, and sometimes even helpful); and to understand that which is truly intuitive, and thus to be able to differentiate between these levels.
