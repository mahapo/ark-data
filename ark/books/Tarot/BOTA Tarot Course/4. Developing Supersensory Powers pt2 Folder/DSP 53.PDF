[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 53 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures One essential aspect of life which we must learn to manipulate properly is the elementof time. If we waste time, or \"kill\" it, or do nothave a correct concept of its importance, we have not yet gained dominion in this area. It is easy enough to say that time is just an illusion anyway so why worry about it? But on the physical plane we must work with this element. Proper use and control of time is one indication of dominion. It demands self-discipline and shows a sense of responsibility to others. If we make an appointment with someone and are late in keeping it, we are not showing thoughtfulness. Another human soul has aruanged the appointment through his own discipline of time. Usually there is no valid reason for allowing ourselves to be delayed. We should guard against letting little things stop us from carrying out our obligations, And, if we think of our obligations as heavy burdens, we are again misinterpreting, because it is a privilege to have this miracle, the ability to plan and organize our time. Everyone should know how long it takes him to do what he does. When you prepare a meal it takes knowledge and discipline to manage the various components of the meal, so that everything is ready at the same time. This is using dominion; this is organization. Our use of time shows a great deal about our relationships. We are usually on time for our jobs, lest we lose them. Should we be less careful of a friend's convenience? Love lies at the heart of punctuality, of reliability, When you love your fellow man enough, even though he be a stranger. ,you keep your contract with him. If we do not keep our contraets we have no societ5r, no civilization, no evolution. Your body could not remain alive, if your cells did not keep their contract with each other. When you cut your finger every cell in the viciniby responds to take care of the situation. The interrelated, disciplined, organized whole is the Dance of Life, To hate our responsibilities, to say, \"I wish that I were free\" is going backwards. Where we really want to go lies in the opposite direction, Only he is free, who is at one with the I AM, the Central God, the Dancer, the Lord of the lJniverse, Attah, which means \"Thou,\" that which is at the center of every one of our hearts. When you are consciously at one with That, you are free. This freedom is your conscious oneness with the Central Gtd, and the choice of your own disciplines. Being able to handle the elements about you, exercising dominion over your environment and having consideration for others is the real significance of freedom. Some people wonder why they have few friends. If they would look into their hearts, they would perhaps see that they have not cared enough to be really thoughtful of others. Caring is what matters. Problems in our profession are often of a similar nature. Lack of ability to see another's point of view is often the cause. This inconsiderateness spreads out, and we find that others are undependable with us, too. It is inevitable that this should be for we are reaping what we have sown and the harvest, though bitter, will compress and discipline us. When we say \"learn to control\" we do not mean repress. Repression limits our ability for love, sympathy or friendly understanding. These are the things that make others"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 53 love and accept us. But some people are afraid. Study their situation carefully and you will flrnd that those who have the most inhibitions emotionally, who are unable to express emotion in the free Dance of Life, are often the ones who have the least discipline in handling their environment, their time and their relationships with other people. From fear of self-committal, or fear of rejection, they do not go deeply in any emotion' They have crippled themselves in relation to the Dance of Life' What is it that gives us dominion over our environment? The idea of discipline is involved, Every true occult teacher, and there are many such in the world, has to have developed enough wisdom and control to put his or her own personality aside for the period they are teaching. They must say during this time, I am in Thee and Thou art in me, for the sake of the One, for the sake of all of us as we travel together towards the higher. Because of the ability to undergo discipline, which is the power of Saturn, and the ability to put aside personality, a contact is made on the inner planes. There is then established a thr.\"-*ry rapport between the teacher, the pupil, and the Higher Self. Often in such contact, itr. p\"pit can experience astonishing assistance with problems. Many of you have come to me in amarement, because your questions have been answered before you have asked. This is just as true for you who have not had personal contact with me' The contact is there because, as members of our organization, we all have a rapport with each other on the inner planes. What is more to the point, your own conscious needs for growth, for your next step, are answered, too. The fact that you can become aware of these answers gives you more arrd rrrore ability to prcmote your olvn evolution; it pours down from the superccnscious levels, in which the Dance of Life exists, As I pointed out, because we study together, we have a group contact on the inner planes. This contact accelerates our growth because Cosmic Consciousness is an awareness of the unity of life, and uniby of life is shown by the fact that we can be, and are, in rapport with each other' You have been shown that there is a unity that exists beyond what appears on the surface of the physical level. In the motions and forms of the different aspects of the Universal Self, it is this unity of life that lies at the heart of true Cosmic Consciousness. To the degree that we experience unity, to that degree are we approaching mo,re and more the level oi Cosmic Consciousness, to that degree do we become more responsible to each other and for each other. This is not absolutely true, of course. We must guard ourselves against masochistic tendencies, and not feel obligated to remain responsible for immature souls who abuse us and exploit our loving natures for their own selfish ends. We have to have enough perception to know when to discard what we consider obligations. We have to also have achieved enough realization of love and unity to change them honestly, and not use this as an excuse to shed real obligations, which should be considered a privilege, not a burden\" A mother who loves, does not hate the fact that she has to get up at all hours of the night for the baby. She may complain about it at times, but she would not be without it\" A father who loves is grateful to the Lord of Life for his children who are his charges to support and nourish, to protect and bring up into adulthood. We need to feel this way about our obligations. We shall feel this way when we begin truly to appreciate the miracle of the interrelationshiPs of all life."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 53 This is symbolized in Tarot Key 21 in that Cosmic Consciousness is assigned to it and Saturn is its ruler, showing that love does not consider discipline hateful. Love does not consider responsibility an interference. Only as you acquire the ability to use these disciplines, as a miracle of your human consciousness, will you be in a position truly to consciously manipulate life, from the subtle elements to the physical areas. The Administrative Intelligence is assigned, Qabalistically, to Key 21. We are administrators, each one of us. An administrator feels responsibility for the corporation, the group, the family, or whatever it is that he or she administers. That is how we must feel but, even more, we must feel that it is the Divine, the true I, that is the real administrator and the real dancer. The physical universe with its restrictions is truly the grace of God. In Qabalah, the Tree of Life, the Divine Soul and the Grace of God are attributed to the Cosmic Mother, the sphere of Saturn. Our attitudes toward responsibility and limitation will change. Then we will become that to which we aspire. Our working together as we are doing will intensify the energies manipulated by this glorious dancer, and help us to achieve the higher levels of supersensory awareness and control. But we will achieve them only as we stop rebelling and thinking that our responsibilities hold us back. We must start to see them as that which drives us forward. In the state of Cosmic Consciousness time, as we experience it, does not exist. Nevertheless, only as you gain dominion over time on this plane, only as you learn to fulfil vour obligations and meet your problems and frustrations with authorit-v. will you be really prepared to manipulate the energies of that state that appears timeless--the state in which past, present, and future are a simultaneous now. Only then, too, will you be able to have the power to bring energies from the higher levels to use on this level, the level where they are so desperately needed. In accepting the Divine Will you must agree to train yourself to see the Dance of Life in every motion, in a bird on the wing, when eating, when walking, when driving your car or running for a bus. Think of motion as the Dance of Life and yourself as a center of the Universal All. This is what we must do as true occultists. This is the way to bring the above to the below. When practicing the technique given below, ponder in your mind these ideas . . . Your body is composed of atoms, of whirling light. These atoms gather together in certain motions to create form. See these atoms of your vehicle as points of light, radiating light in whirling motion. You consist of whirling motion; you are a body of light. Think of the largest bodies of light in the universe, the nebulae that we see in outer space. Realize that these are made up of billions of suns, all in whirling motion, formed of atoms of hydrogen, the most minute making up the very largest. You and the nebulae and the atoms are all in whirling rnotion, in strict conformity to the cosmic law, which we call the Dance of Life. Realize that all this light, all this substance, is really a condensation of Universal Mind which this dancer represents symbolically. The mind-substance can be thought of as falling light, dancing in complete conformity with cosrnic law, under the direction of the Universal One. Remember alwavs the Universal One has Its center in Your heart."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI\"ASSWORKON SUPERSENSORYPOWERS: 53 In all the universe there is polarity. Not too long ago, it was discovered that there is a mirror image of matter/energy, with positrons for electrons and negatively charged protons. To this mirror image has been given the curious name of anti-matter. Science is coming close to some of our own mysteries, though it will be a long time before it begins to understand the significance of what it has discovered. TECHNIQUE FOR TAROT KgY NO. 21, THE WORLD Fiemember that it is the proper attitude that we need to develop more fully, as we practice the technique. Begin by permeating yourself and your aura through and through with blue violet\" This is the color of Key 21, the 32nd path on the Tree of Life. See the color extending about two feet around yourself in an oval like that on the Key. See how the Dance of Life is enclosed in the Cosmic Egg. This is the compression within a form that consciousness develops and evolves, and through which it expresses its miracle. Having done that, picture yourself as being this Key, see yourself as the dancing figure in the center of the Key. Send up a prayer to what the dancer represents symbolically, to the Divine Androgyne, both male and female, for we are all one being. Call this Universal One, ,,Thou;\" in Hebrew, \"Attah.\" Think of It in that manner as being in your own heart. Recognize the I AM as being in everyone else, too, This word, Attah, has a vibrating power when you send up your call; it is the original name that means Thou. \"Attah,\" who art in all things and art all things to me, bring me to the knowledge of who and what I am. (Attah in l\"Iebre'w is spelled AThH.) See yourself as the flrgure of the dancer holding the light, of which all things are made, in whirling spiral motion. The motion of the spiral in the right hand goes from right to left. Imagine this light in your right hand as extending to your feet, Then have it begin moving upward around you in a spiral toward your head, spiraling in a right to left motion. In a sense you wind yourself into an oval cocoon. This intensifies the vibratory light in your being. Have this spiraling motion continue upward until it reaches to about a foot above your head. Now picture the spiral held in your left hand as extending to your head and lhen moving downward around you in the opposite direction. This spiral moves from left to right. As this spiral of light in the left hand moves downward and around you, have it interlace with the light of the other spiral which is moving upward in the opposite direction. In this way, you will be immersing yourself with the energies that travel in both directions, with all of the symbologr that this Tarot Key includes, reaching for Cosmic Consciousness . Having thus immersed yourself in light, and having invited the Divine to help you to attain conscious recognition of the Dance of Life, meditate for a moment on the fact that you are not dependent on any physical thing whatever for your consciousness or your security. That the physical is under your dominion, that you are not its slave. It is your thoughts, emotions and suggestions that develop your physical environment, your life\" After finishing this practice, re-immerse yourself in blue violet to form the grounding element, so that you will not leave yourself open to psychic incursion, You will thus be open only to the impact of the disciplined symbols of this Key, dominion and Cosmic Consciousness."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 53 AFFIRMATION: In all motion, in all movement, I recognize the beautiful Dance of Life.
