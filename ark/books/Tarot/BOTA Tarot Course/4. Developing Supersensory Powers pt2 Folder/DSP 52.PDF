[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC D(TENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 52 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures With this lesson we come to the last Tarot Key, #2L, and to the last technique to help you to develop supersensory perception and power. Let us first analyze Key 2L Qabalistically. The Hebrew letter assigned to this Key is Tav. In Qabalah, Tav means mark or cross. You see a cross binding the wreaths together at the top and bottom. It represents a figure 8, could we see it all, but from our vantage point it is a cross. A cross is a mark with many connotations. There is the expression, to make one's mark upon the world; a cross is used as a signature. Many who have not learned to write make this sign, putting their mark to a paper or an agreement. Hence, the mark or cross has to do with authorizing, with authority. This is significant, because the pair of opposites assigned to this key is dominion and slavery, Another attribution of Key 21 is Cosmic Consciousness. The connection between Cosmic Consciousness and dominion and slavery is obvious. If one has true Cosmic Consciousness, he has dominion of a kind. The farther from Cosmic Consciousness one is, the more he is enslaved by the conditions and situations of life. The type of consciousness assigned to this key, Qabalistically, is called the Administrative Intelligence, and this brings us back to the concept of dominion and slavery. The administrator has dominion, and the Administrative Intelligence is assigned to this key. Curiously enough, in addition to the attributions which we have given, Key 21 is assigned, astrologically, to the planet Saturn. In astrologr. Saturn is thought of as the Greater Malefic. Yet, dominion and slavery, as related to all of the ideas of administration correspond exactly with the concept of Saturn, even though most astrologers have misinterpreted the idea. Let us, therefore, consider some of the ideas that astrologers have in relation to Saturn, and then what it represents in esoteric astrologr. Saturn is called the Greater Malefic. Why? Because it has been found that, wherever certain aspects are made with or by Saturn, there is a great deal of frustration, burden, responsibility, and depression. This happens when other planets relate to Saturn in what are normally called bad aspects. In Esoteric Astrologr, our interpretation of the \"Greater Malefltc\" is somewhat different, because Saturn is the sphere of influence assigned to the Cosmic Mother in Qabalah. It is true that Saturn is the limiter. But if you will reread what we had to say about limitations in the lessons on Key 7 and the symbolism of the fields and fences, you will remember that it is the ability to limit that makes us human. The primary difference between human and animal consciousness is that a human consciousness knows how to limit its attention, to discipline itself, its emotions, its acts, whereas animal consciousness cannot. It is the inhibition of the universal eners/ that gives the ability to have self-consciousness, since self-consciousness means the ability to concentrate on whatever it is that we mean by \"I.\" Otherwise how could we be aware that we are? Thus, the limitations imposed by Saturn apparently have meaning other than those we are usually given. There is a greater concept involved than is realized by the astrologers who state that, if Saturn does thus and so there will be limitation, sonow, that one might have to work a great deal harder for what one gets."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 52 This common interpretation implies a great deal of unhappiness in Saturn. Let us therefore, examine the question of what dominion and slavery are, and see if we can discover what the Dance of Life actually is. The Dance of Life is portrayed in Tarot Key 2L. You can see that the Key says that the forces assigned to Saturn are really the Dance of Life. The obvious question is how an attribution like the Dance of Life can be given to the limiting principle of the universe, to that which takes freedom, ecstatic freedom of consciousness, and compresses it. But what does a person do when he dances? He limits motion. He formalizes motion. Formal motion is discipline. It is a definite discipline that circumscribes motion and activify. The result is the dance, formal ballet or whatever grration of the day may be in fashion. Even the fad dances popular with the young take a great deal of discipline. Yet, when we watch people perform such dances we say, \"My, what uninhibited people these are! Just look at the way they are carrying on.\" Why do we say this? Because we are misinterpreting the dance. There is nothing uninhibited about something that requires so much discipline--and courage! Learn how to enter into the spirit of the Dance of Life, even though you might not like the thought of endangeringyour joints in the latest popular dance. Whether we dance or not is our own choice, but our reaction to what we see in a dance is important. It is illogical that people should look at a series of motions that take great ability and discipline to perform and interpret them as uninhibited. Anythingthat requires discipline is not uninhibited. We lose the spirit of the Dance of Life, because we do not understand the principle of Saturn and its true function. We do not realize that, every time we enter into any kind of form or discipline, even though it may be used foolishly, immaturely, even evilly, we are seeing a miraculous element, the use of the inhibitory faculties tc express the Dance of Life. There can be no Dance of Life without the principle of limitation, because there would be no form. When we say form, we do not mean the tangible form alone. Procedures are also form, \"The meeting will now come to order;\" that is a form\" Formalities are all disciplined uses, rituals. The Dance of Life itself is a ritual, wholly a ritual, In the training of the mystery Schools, the use of the ritual is vitally important, because it is through a knowledge of proper ritual, with proper use of intonations, the power of sound, and the use of color combined in very special ways, that we attune ourselves more and more closely to the spirit of the Dance of Life, which is the universal ritual. The electrons swing about the nucleus of the atoms in specialized ways. If they did not, if they refused to, we should have no creation. The ways in which the atoms group together, the ways in which the molecules group together, are examples of the continuous motion of the Dance of Life, the ritual of the universe. Most of the planets have attendant moons circling about them. The planets with their moons move about the sun. The sun with its planets circles the galaxy, all moving in the ritual of the Dance of Life, held in disciplined motion\" If our planet Earth were not held at its exact distance from the sun in disciplined motion, it could not support the life that we know. We call this sustaining in place the law of gravitation\" When we give things names, we often think that we have explained them. But the fact that we have given a name does not explain it; it remains a mystery and a miracle. Every motion, every example of the power to inhibit, every indication of the power to develop form, every form that we see any where, is an indication of the Dance of Life. The ritual of the universe is in progress, is in motion, is being expressed, playing its role in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 52 the scheme of unfolding livingness in evolved living organisms. This universe of ours is vibrantly alive, as this Tarot Key shows. Motion in the dance gives the spirit of freedom. If you love to dance or have ever loved to dance, you will remember that the motion of the dance is the spirit of rapturous and ecstatic freedom. Next, you experience this freedom because of disciplined activity of your body. The atoms of your being are inhibited from random departure. They are held in a limited form. The principle of limitation, of inhibition is being used. That is why you have a vehicle, through which to live, to experience, to see, to know, to taste, to love, to grow, to evolve. This miracle shows that there is nothing wrong or evil in the inhibitory and disciplined aspects of life. These are the things that give us the spirit of beauty, the miracle of freedorn. Until we can see what dominion and slavery represent in terms of limitation, we are not even remotely prepared for Cosmic Consciousness, for it and limitation go hand in hand. You have evolved, developed from Cosmic Consciousness originally, it is true, but you are unaware of it. There is a great difference between being a part of rapturous everythingness yet utterly unaware, an undifferentiated potential spark, and being an actual experiencing self, deliberately participating in the awareness level of Cosmic Consciousness. There is a gteat difference, and it is the principle of limitation that makes it possible to participate in full awareness. Saturn, the Cosmic Mother, the compressor, the molder into form is a symbol of this. Is it any wonder that there has been so much subconscious hatred of the mother image, the dark mother, as some schools of psycholog' call her? In actuality. those of us who are honest with ourselves know that it is usually during periods of limitation that something in us has surged forward with a desire and aspiration to higher levels of knowing. Here again, you can see the interaction of the law of opposites. When things run smoothly, harmoniously, efflrciently, when we have no problems, we also have no drives. I should have said, \"almost no drives,\" for the drive of a curious nature is enough for some of us. Curiosity is a good quality. Intelligent people are always curious, though it does not follow that all curious people are intelligent, or that they are necessarily using what intelligence they have positively. Curiosit5r, however, is a symptom of intelligence because only when you are curious will you find out things that you did not know before. A scientist is a hyper-curious individual and this has driven him to science, The occultist, too, is hyper-curious, otherwise he would not have enough interest and excitement to seek what he could learn of his relations to the universe, what he is, why he is, where he is going, and from whence he has come. Because curiosity alone cannot drive us quite enough, we need, and we receive, the discipline of Saturn, which grows us. That is why we have compressions because we are being pressed down to give us the need to burst out. The positive and negative energies of the universe always interact in this manner, Every sorrow has been a frustration, but that sorrow has pressed us to look for freedom. In analyzing the pair of opposites, dominion and slavery, we are looking at a Dance of Life, which we are usually involved with in terms of limitations, but which we have thought of as an uninhibited activity. Now, we are discovering that it is one of the most"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER.S: 52 inhibited activities for the vehicle and the mind. The mental and motor coordination involved in dancing requires a great degree of control. This is dominion. We are making a grave error if we think of the Dance of Life as something unmanifest and invisible. The physical universe is the way in which the Lord of Life expresses Its own livingness, through motion, dance and ritual, Therefore, gaining control of the physical body and the environment is essential to attaining Cosmic Consciousness. A sad development in some schools of thought is the teaching that one should walk away from the physical plane to reach for Cosmic Consciousness and illumination. Those who walk away from the world, often do have some glorious mystical experiences. They may even think that they have received complete illumination, and will need no more incarnations. But if you have met any who think in this manner, you have probably realized how absurd and erroneous their belief is. In our teachings we know that physieal experiences are real, and furthermore, to turn one's back on the dominion of the physical to attain liberation is futile. I know of at least two aspirants who in previous incarnations attained to a very high mystical state by withdrawing from the world and the world work to live in isolation taking on no responsibilities. These two had a most diff'rcult life in this incarnation because they are being forsed by their own Higher Self to develop the ability to appreciate incarnations, the flower of the Tree of Life, the physical universe, the garment of the Lord of Life, the vehicles and forms. They are being forced not only to appreciate this level but to learn how to handle it\" What do we mean by handling this level? We have all read or heard romantic and exciting tales of the power of the Initiate, and while some of them are not untrue, some are most incorrect. The Initiate has, basically, the power to control his or her physical environment\" Those who have not yet developed a sense of responsibility to their fellowman are not the sort of person who can have higher powers on the supersensory levels. The sense of responsibility, of duty, is an integral part of true aspiration. When Saturn makes certain aspects, astrologers say that you are going to have extra responsibilities. This should not make you unhappy. What is wrong with responsibility? Too many people behave like infants, wanting to be fed and washed and clothed and told how beautiful they are, without having to be a good boy or girl; wanting to play at living, without having a receptive disciplinary relationship. It is a sad fact that many occult aspirants do not realize that the place in which they have to prove their teachings is here and now\" Here is where you develop dominion or slavery. Let us examine the implications of this and think out what it means in terms of daily life. If the results of our investigation disquiet you, remember that the Saturn aspect of life is compelling you to grow. It is difficult to accept I know. We do not like to be uncomfortable, even though we need to be at times. We need to burst out of the smaller shells of our undeveloped or unevolved consciousness into the sunlight of true illumination."}]
