[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 17 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures From Lesson 16 we learned that in creating a vehicle for a new soul, the individual collects its physical substance from the mother and shapes it to form the physical body in which it will be manifesting. Although the physical body has a good deal to do with what kind of emotions we have, as modern psychology has shown, it is not the body that causes the emotions. Emotional response is caried in the image of the self, which incorporates the emotional matrix. Once the body is born, it does not stop collecting substance. You know what a newborn baby looks like. When my baby was born, I was overwhelmed with compassion for her ugliness. When people admired her, I thought them either hypocrites or blind. But within three days she was beautiful to my eyes. The body never ceases to collect from its environment. Eating, breathing and drinking are forms by which we continue to collect substance from the environment, to draw the elements we need to shape ourselves to the image. When we are grown, we have finished one part of the job, but we keep drawing from the environment in order to remain as we are. Then, in old age, we become fixed in mind and emotions, at which point that substance which we have drawn upon begins to be withdrawn, dissolving our bodies. It is the limitations of the time/space continuum that makes this reciprocal action difficult to see. You no doubt have seen slow motion films. What are apparent birth and apparent death are simply experiences in our consciousness, in slow motion. Use your imagination, work with your creative imagination, and vou will see vourselves differently\" This is necessary in order to prepare you for the magic we shall develop with the rest of the Tarot Keys. Creative imagination is the magic we use, but through the medium of the Magician, the attention! You have seen pictures of flowers taken at regular intervals, a day apart, or several hours apart, which, when combined, give you the reverse of the slow motion film, showing you developments from the first shoot of the plant until the full blown flower is there. It may have taken several months for the plant to develop, but it can be shown developing in a few minutes. This is a startling experience, to see a living, unfolding glory all at once, instead of in the slow step-by-step development. Think of yourselves in this way. It is the same slow motion of life and death through incarnations that makes you interpret them in a certain way. If you could see that you are merely experiencing yourself in a slow motion world, you would begin to realize the relativity of manifestation, and to open your consciousness to experience the reality of who and what you really are. You will stop identifying yourself with the personality element that impinges upon the physical body. The role played by the Cosmic Mother is as follows: After the physical mother has given birth to us, we are still absorbing from the environment, still being nourished by life. Though we may think, in adult life, that we grow and nourish ourselves, it is life that does this all the time; the world is the womb of God, and the womb of God has many different levels. When God wishes to give birth to an aspect of Itself, such as an evolving human individuality, God gives it a physical vehicle, God uses that aspect of Itself which we understand as the female principle. This feminine principle is reflected into the microcosm through every female creatute in life. Our sense of separation may cause us to think that the mother gives life to a child, but what did she do? She supplied the special environment"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPBRSENSORY POWERS: 17 which has karmic eonnections. But since God gave birth in reality, and God is All, does it not stand to reason that every living female creature is the feminine aspect of God and every living male creature is the masculine aspect of God? God gave birth to you, and to your children, and to every instrument of Itself. Each is an individual aspect of God, for there is nothing apart from God. If we think of our births in this manner, we will have to view our physical mothers in the light of God's channel, no matter what feelings we may have developed in our hearts towards her. It is amazing how many people in occult work have had cruel or unloving mothers. I think that some great souls must choose physical mothers with sick personalities in order to be driven to flrnd answers. When one feels rejected enough, unloved enough, that is when he is driven to find the reason. If he has evolved the capacitSr, he will search for security somewhere other than on the physical plane. It is not that one must have a monster for a mother to enter occult work; it is just that this often happens. Subconsciously in most people, there are likely to be immature feelings towards the mother, even when the relationship between mother and child is favorable. It is very rare for a mother and child relationship to develop into something completely mature. In the mother's womb we had for a time a heaven within which there were no problems. We floated in the amniotic fluid; we did not have to breathe, nor expend effort to feed ourselves; there was no worry. This state of rapture we all experience during life's embryonic stage. But suddenly--and painfully--we are expelled from our Eden, our wonderful, safe, secure abode! It is a terrible shock to the psyche to be born. The pain of birth leaves it*s mark. Hence, one feels very resentful torvards one's mother for ncrt letting one stay in that carefree state. In all of us there endures a yearning to return to that first state of rapture and security. Strangely, this embryonic state of contentment is closely analogous to a certain phase of cosmic consciousness. Hindu books frequently refer to drowning in the great ocean, or the Sacred Mother. This is what the embryonic experience is, a lesser expression of the larger principle. On the Inner Plane, the stream of cosmic consciousness is an actual fluidic substance. The prebirth experience is no different from floating in the state of bliss, peace, love and security that one experiences in this level of cosmic consciousness. The relationship with one's mother has additional considerations. It is very important that our subconsciousness transmute any of our reactions as described above, either negative or positive. If your relationship withyour mother was pleasant, it is easier to handle this. If your relationship with your mother was unfavorable, it is more difficult. Nevertheless, it must be done. You must think of your mother as the outer channel of expression through which God created you, looking upon that individuality whose body was used with gratitude, whether the relationship was tragic or wonderful. In this way you will give your subconsciousness the most potent suggestion possible to increase the power of your creative imagination. You will place in your own bay of subconsciousness a basic idea that, completely expanded, gives you a power of creation equal to that of the Divine Will. You"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: L7 will be continuously implanting within your subconsciousness the seed idea that you are a child of God. You have heard this statement, \"f am a child of God,\" but has it been just a concept to you? Anything which remains just an abstract concept, though having its place, cannot have a practical effect. It is possible to make this concept more concrete, to give yourself more vital imagery. What could be more effective in helping you to develop yourself towards the experience of feeling and knowing your kinship with God than realizing that you are an actual, not a s5rmbolic, child of God just as you are the actual child of your physical parents? This knowing awareness is one of the things which will bring you to true cosmic consciousness. There are different levels and different degrees of parenthood. The gratitude that you must feel toward the channel of your physical creation is a part of the Great Work' No matter how unkind or kind your mother is, she suffered when you were born; that was her contribution to life and to you, Whatever suffering you have had, it has been to help you grow, to deepen your capacity and your ability to love. Put this concept into practice; think about it as often as you can, to prepare the very cells of your body to know themselves as the result of the offspring of the Divine for you are That. Definite, clear and sharply delineated imagery is essential to bring you that experience. Use this Tarot Key. Remember, whenever you use any of the Tarot Keys in accordance with the principles that it suggests, you are making suggestions to vour subconsciousness in the most potent forms that exist, as well as attuning yourself magnetically to those who not only created these Keys, but who keep sending their messages through the universal s5rmbolism of the Keys. Keeping this in mind is one of the important meditations that one should perform with this Key. You will find the information we have just imparted nowhere else, although all that we teach has been developed from the basic Qabalistic teachings as set forth by Dr, Case. A great deal of advanced material has been developed from the elementary courses and are extensions of the original teachings. We wish to acquaint you with the various advanced aspects of the work, so that your ability to utilize these principles and to understand them will be enlarged. Supersensory awareness, creative imagination, is the mother, the means, through which all the different supersensory elements develop. The seed that is planted grows, no matter what the level is. Wherever you see a physical manifestation, it is merely a certain vibratory end result continuous with the other elements of being. It is just as your consciousness and the body you now carry or wear are continuous with the moment of your conception, a continuous stream that has never been broken. In the same way, whatever has been manifested in your environment as something physical has its continuous line, its stream of consciousness, extending to the innermost spiritual essence of itself. Even those who appear to us as separate individuals seem so only because we are seeing a partial picture. You will have misery only so long as your creative imagination has not evolved to the point where you can hold certain images that are in harmony with the spirituality that you are, to the degree that you learn to recognize your own spiritual essence."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: t7 Working with this idea in terms of your relationship to the Divine, you will receive from the Divine the extra intensifr and energies you need. You will then more readily create the mental and emotional images that will give you a more wonderful tomorow. It is what you think yourself to be that brings your experiences. If you think that you are worthless (or worthy), this is what you will become, this is what your environment will reflect. We are not a body alone; we are our environment, for our environment takes from us, and we give back to it. Real creative imagery depends upon the ability to tune in to the higher parts of consciousness. Some are able to do this without being aware of it--for instance, the artist does so in terms of his art. You should wish to become the artist of life. This is the greatest artistry of all, and to perfect it you must see yourself in your true guise. You must keep holding mental images of yourself and expressing their creative effects in the problems which arise. You must develop more of the tremendous powers that go with consciousness. It is important to realize the vital elements that brought about our birth, and realize that Jesus was not the only one who was begotten of God, but is truly an older brother. We, too, are begotten of God. As you develop more and more strongly the feeling of being the child of God, the time sense will condense itself, and the time will shorten for that which ordinarily takes a long time to manifest normally. This is one of the causes for the instant healings of the physical body. For a split second there is an attunement with the higher part of the selftrood; time is condensed to produce what is termed a miraculous healing. In reality, this is no different from healings that take several months, In using the following techniq 'es, think of the Co.snric Mofher as t]re Shield of Love- Think of her as that which you are and are attuned to for all of life. TECHNISUE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 3. THE EMPRESS Green, Emerald green, is the color of Venus, the throatcenter. It is the throat center which rules the other Chakras. It is only when the throat center is well-charged with electromagnetic enerry that we are able to begin to control our emotional nature properly. Feel yourself permeated with green, vibrating, pulsing color. Image the figure of the Empress as being above your head. Look well at the various colors, especially the wheat and the water\" Picture the Key above your head as the cosmic female aspect of God. Then look at the wheat and the earth from which it grows. Mentally choose a deflrnite creative thought, something you wish to be in terms of your personality. Have the Empress take this seed and plant it in the earth. Have her bring a trickle of the water from the pool to water it. Remember that that stream is the substance of your universal consciousness. Hold the feeling that relates you to whatever you want to do in terms of your personality. Build yourself a flame of green light and release it to subconsciousness to do its work. Carry out this exercise one or two times each day, AFFIRMATION: I am a child of Divinity, As a manifested vehicle inherits traits from its generic strain, so do I, as child of the Most High, inherit the powers of my cosmic parents. I send you my love, physical mother of mine, for being an aspect of the Divine--for lending your substance to grow me. And thus do I clear the channels for the full and spiritual knowledge of my Divine heredity. Sanctified in the love of thee, Cosmic Mother, let me now awaken to the full knowledge of my wondrous heritage,"}]
