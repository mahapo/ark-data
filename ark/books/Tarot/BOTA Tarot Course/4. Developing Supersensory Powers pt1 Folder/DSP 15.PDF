[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 15 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures When we speak in our lessons of the physical world, we mean something that is really not differentiated from the spiritual world. While we are incarnated, our seeing, our consciousness, is concentrated within a particular range of vibration we call the physical universe. Therefore, our consciousness experiences itself in that portion of the vibratory spectrum as a physical entity. When we die our concentration is removed from the vibrational levels that have given us the physical imagery, the physical experiences in physical form, but our consciousness is still in full existence. We do not go an5rwhere else when we die; we have just transferred our concentration, our consciousness, our electromagnetic pattern, to a different octave of the vibratory range. This level is, curiously enough, a subconscious level. Entering these levels at death is not like insanit5r, since the break has been made at our point of concentration, so that the conscious livingness transfers to a specific level in subconsciousness. This fact is not realized by many who study spiritualism. They do not realize that conscious existence in the astral world or the astral body is identical with the rest of existence, and that there are many, many levels. It is the subconscious life wtrich is the foundation for all creation. Therefore, in essence, it is our true life. Nevertheless, it can be our true life only if the subconscious and superconscious parts of our awareness are properly balanced. These are the levels we are learning to work with. The importance of keeping our attention focused and our awareness balanced by developing the self-consciously directed powers eannot be over-emphasized. Astonishing things happen to the consciousness when we permit ourselves to drift uncontrolled into astral or subconscious states and then let those states take us overl when we give ourselves over to blind association without that self-direction that we have labored untold eons to acquire. One can almost sympathize at times with those people who use this method to escape from the harsh realities of conscious life. It is no doubt more pleasant for many to imagine themselves as Napoleon or a Messiah. Such imaginings are not completely wrong. That is the curious part of insanity; a portion of that mental state is very real and true. But that valid part is not adequate in itself to provide the way of thinking and feeling required in this level of life. We will have a little more sympathy, I hope, for those people who drift over the border of conscious reality when we realize exactly what has taken place. It is amazing how many people have spiritual experiences while insane. Yet we cannot say that all or any specific type of spiritual experience is insanity. These people who are insane have become this way by giving up their powers of self-conscious direction, To be cured, they will go through tremendous trials and extreme exertion in order to re-establish their consciously directed knowing on a firm basis, The experience of superconsqiousness, the experience of being Christ, is something that has come to all people in all timesl therefore, we should not be surprised when we hear of many people who developed insanity who also have some such experience. They also often become terrorized by demons. I know several people who have gone through such experiences, and their stories are fascinating examples of the powers of subconsciousness. What miracles reside there, as well as what horrors! Subconsciousness is trulv"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 15 PANDORA'S BOX. Knowledge of such cases helps us to understand more fully how important it is to hold fast to the ability to direct our own attention, and to develop this faculty in every way that we can. The telepathic interchange that takes place at all times is not merely a mental process. We have a way in speech of dividing the mind and the emotions. As a matter of fact, mental images backed by the emotions are radiated with much more intensity than are images arising in a placid mind. Our self-conscious minds are normally so fixed in the fantasy of separateness that they are unable to recognize telepathic radiations even though they are affecting us moment by moment. Awareness of telepathic interchange becomes very important to the advanced occult aspirant. For this reason it is vital for the advanced student to seek the company of fellow aspirants and to avoid, when possible, the company of those who have surges of hate, as well as materialistic power drives. You have, no doubt, noticed the contagious emotion spread by a hysterical person, and the emotional reaction we feel in the presence of someone who is trying to force your emotional attention. You were picking up emotional contacts on the telepathic levels. The more we advance along the Path of Return, the more we lecome aware of our supersensory faculties and the more careful we must become in order to protect ourselves from the emotional forces of the lynch mob, the hate thinkers. Except for very short periods of time, the advanced student must carefully avoid the company of those who project these destrtretive sta.tes of consciousness. We have to live in the world and deal with this world; we have to make a living; but we should try as much as possible to seek the friendship and participate in the group work of those with whom our emotional telepathy is in rapport. We must place ourselves in the company of those who will nourish our aspirations because reciprocity will hasten the development of our powers. As an example from the Eastern Tradition, the Adept Ramakrishna had achieved tremendous rapport with cosmic consciousness. After his disciple, Vivekananda, had gone through much preliminary training, there came the time when he, too, stood at the edge of his own experience of consciousness. It took a mere touch from Ramakrishna for Vivekananda to experience cosmic consciousness for himself. Now did Ramakrishna give this experience to Vivekananda? Not exactly; Vivekananda had first to be fully prepared consciously for the experience. But the final \"push\" was given to him by Ramakrishna who gave him that impetus by producing the basic telepathic vibration to which his disciple responded. This type of mutual rapport is a common technique utilized by advanced students following the Western Tradition as taught by B.O.T.A. Lacking personal contact, members of B.O,T.A. attune themselves to inspiration and higher aspiration, receiving telepathic aid through the techniques being given in this course, There are many different varieties of awareness, of realization, of perception, which open up for us like the petals of a rose."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 15 Here, however, we are discussing a principle of what we might call sympathetic vibration; i. e., the telepathic receptivity of the cosmic vibration received by students and disciples from their teachers and gurus who have already achieved certain levels of consciousness, or who are at least able to achieve these levels during moments of aspiration and meditation. These teachers pour out the vibrations of higher consciousness at these levels telepathically. So telepathy has a great deal more to offer than we previously may have realized. Some alleged schools of thought and some teachers promise that the aspirant will not need to make any great effort of his own or on his own. These teachers say: \"Just give up your life to me and do as I direct. Eat what I tell you. Meditate on me. I will present you with divine experience and liberation.\" The schools of thought that tell you this are not giving a true presentation of the underlying principle at all! They are taking a partial truth and claiming that it is the whole area of realization. In truth, each sincere aspirant must work to develop his own consciousness and individuality and his ability to utilize the powers that exist through telepathy. This will prepare him to take that final push or step, either through his own contact with the inner forces or alternatively with the aid of his teacher. In a sense, the lower evolutionary levels are always exerting their influence in and through us, trying to pull us away from our aspirations until we learn how to focus our attention, until we train ourselves to receive telepathically only that which we choose. We cannot escape from the telepathic flow of life, nor should we want to. But we can choose with discrimination what is to have the strongest influence on us, Distracting though it may be, we cannot entirely escape the telepathic impacts from the lower levels which bring us the hating, pushing, and ignorance rampant in the subconsciousness of the undeveloped mass mind. But we can and should reject these unevolved influences. Our rejection of these lower telepathic impacts gives us the ability to assist in the evolution of the rest of life. As we develop our telepathic centers strongly and positively with discrimination, then those impacts which come in from the lower levels will be channeled through our advanced consciousnesses, producing transmutations of the lower influences in more positive directions. This is how evolution takes place; this is how we help those who are below us. And in like manner, those who are above us are helping us at this very moment, helping us to gain perception and to heighten our consciousness and our awareness. We shall tell you a great deal of the creative power of subconsciousness in the next few lessons. It may be of interest and help in understanding these powers to relate a true story demonstrating the principle of telepathy in action. This story would have gone unnoticed or unrealized as such, had I not been aware of how powerful telepathic impact can be, especially when the ones involved are physically present. For many years our little parsonage was used to carry out all the work of the Order. Our heating facilities in this house at that time were very poor indeed. We had a little gas heater which allowed the floor level to freeze while the upper part of the house was over-heated."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 15 Although it is very important to be alert and always aware of the physical plane, I must confess that there are times when I myself have not been very alert on the physical. This acute inconvenience of the temperature distribution was something that I just did not take note of. It did not occur to me that there was something that could or should be done about it, It just never entered my mind, though my feet would freeze while I gasped for breath, whenever I tried to heat the place. However, when my daughter came home from boarding school, she used a little room for her homework. It was not long until she began to complain that her feet were freezing. Then the maternal instinct came into play! When my child complained about being cold and showed her unhappiness and discomfort, for the first time I directed my attention to the problem. It occurred to me that something could and should be done about it. I could not have the child suffering and besides, how was she to study? I decided, therefore, to look into the heating problem. I looked through the classified section of the telephone directory and contacted several heating firms. When I inquired about prices, the more I inquired the more outrageous the prices became. After making my investigation, I came to the conclusion that I knew exactly what was needed. Money? No. We did not have the money for it, but that was beside the point. I knew what was needed, and what kind of heat was needed. The house had a basement, and a floor furnace would serve very nicely. I knew where it should be situated so the heat would go into my daughter's room and would also heat the rest of the house, That was as far as I could go. I was able to visualize where the furnace should go, what kind of heat we ought to have and that was that. I knew that was how it had to be; how it was to come about I did not know. Three months later, Dr. Case began a new lecture series. One evening, without any warning or preamble, a student in this class came up to me and asked, \"What kind of heating do you have at the headquarters?\" I said, \"Very inadequate and insufficient.\" He said, \"What you need is a floor furnace.\" I said, \"You are absolutely right.\" He said, \"I'll install one.\" I said, \"But we haven't got the funds.\" He answered, \"This will be my donation to B.O.T.A. I install floor furnaces; that is my profession.\" Within a few weeks the heating was installed exactly where and how I had vistralized it. Now, what actually happened to bring this about? When our visualizations are manifested, we have been using the power of telepathy. We must rcalize this. In the same way, when we have disappointments, again we have been using the power of telepathy. Telepathy that creates is not something intermittent, but the result of a deliberate focusing\" I held a picture before me, and I filled it with emotions, so that it was a living image. This was how it had to be to manifest itself. Telepathically, this was what happened. If we understand this principle, we shall know better how to direct our consciousness in the future and develop our awareness of the telepathic force that plays between and through people. In this instance, there was a human being in the vicinity who was receptive to my picture, a spiritual aspirant who was ready for our work. He had what we needed, and we had what he needed, but the relationship was still on the subconscious level, not conscious to either of us. It existed on the level of the High Priestess. Therefore, from that level, the things that had to be done were done, and he was drawn to where he had to be. That was the way, the method that God used to make this particular contact."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 15 Each of you came into the work, whether you realized it or not, because of telepathic contacts, even though you may think it is because you had read an advertisement in the newspaper. That was just the outer form of an earlier inner contact. The underlying contact is always made within. Before an occurrence manifests physically, it has become a finished product on the Inner Planes. The contact, the relationships, the interpermeations, are already there. Remember then, when you have a problem that the answer is already worked out at the subconscious levels. There is no need to worry about resultsl they have been made inevitable by the time you have become aware of the problem. This principle also works in reverse. If we are subconsciously determined to have a disappointment, then through the images that we transmit telepathically to others, we ane telepathically forcing people to give us the desired disappointment. That is what we mean when we say that all beings are in continuous telepathic rapport. Now, you can see why it is so important to use the Magician in order to direct the forces of the High Priestess. Becoming fully aware of what is happening makes telepathy much more effective. We rcalize that we are not dealing with attenuated nothingness, but with the most potent and vital substance there is, the substance of subconsciousness, which interpermeates and interrelates with all. Many of you may have consciously experienced waves of love coming from someone close toyou. If youwere prepared and openedyourselves and tuned in,you would transmit love back to that pgrson for the other to experience. That is a form of telepathic rapport. Telepathy is something more than we normally realize, something more magical. It is the primal substance of the unification of life, the path of the High Priestess, which is called in Qabalah the Uniting Intelligence. It unites us with that to which we direct our attention. Thus, what we attend to with our powers of The Magician is what comes to fruition and pours forth. The powers that make this so are those of the High Priestess, flowing forth, connecting us together by all the links through which we are interwoven in the one life. The interpermeations between us are far more intricate than we usually realize, and this we shall illustrate for you in subsequent lessons by means of various anecdotes from our own experiences and the experiences of others. Since these examples are from real life, they will become real to you, so you will realize what magnificent magical powers are available to you. Imagine how wonderful it will be when you are able to say to yourself when an unpleasant emotion pours in upon you, \"This does not belong to me. This is a negative emotion attempting to influence me, but is generated by someone else. I will send back love and hope to whomever or whatever it may be.\" With this technique you are not pulled down into the depths, but instead you will be helping to pull others up, even though you have never met them. Telepathy is a magic power. When people are closely related, they often become conscious of this force, of the power of this principle. Accounts of happenings often show more than just a description of a principle underlying the incident. When a principle is demonstrated in action, it becomes more real. You will be able to search into your own experience and discover the principle at work there, too, even though you did not realize its operation at the time. As you study these lessons, you will see what is happening to you. You will feel the principle of the High Priestess in action in you at all times. You will see the fluidic substance of life and learn to experience its peace and to accept its strife as just passing things, just the ripples of an ocean wave passing by. Your attention during"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 15 these lessons should be directed to seeing subconsciousness in all its various ramifications, forms and actions, how it works and how real it actually is. The first time a complete realization of its power came to me, I was almost terrified, because of my recognition of what a tremendous power we can direct. To the degree that we become aware of the universal substance and discern its inner workings (as you will as you work with the impacts and intensification of the Tarot Keys), to that degree will you become more receptive to telepathic help from higher levels. You must be willing to accept that responsibiliby if you wish to achieve the glory and the magic of consciously attaining to that which you have always been in essence. EXERCISE FOR TAROT KEY NO. 2. THE HIGH PRIESTESS While comfortably seated, look at the High Priestess. Breathe deeply and rhythmically. Immerse yourself in an oval of blue. Visualize the High Priestess above you full size and in full color. Mentally direct the High Priestess into you. Now enter into the spirit of this Key--become this key. Notice the flow of water from the lap of your robe. Visualize it as sparklingblue water. Mentally direct this fluidic substance of your subconsciousness in a clockwise direction, whirling round and round the outer edges of your aura, approximately one foot wide. Now irnage T'he Magician above you in full life size and three dimension€. After whirling the water clockwise seven times, with a quick act of will stop the motion. Notice the scroll you hold in your hand--the scroll of your memory--record of your past reaching back into and before time began. Notice your poise, stillness and balance as you sit between the white and black pillars. Pay attention to the veil behind you. Again, notice the flow of sparkling blue water from the lap of your robe, coruscating down to your feet. Take this flow of water mentally, turn it counterclockwise upwards to the top of your High Priestess selfhood. Continue it upwards, and like a fountain let it spray the garden of The Magician in the Tarot Key above your head. From the center of this fountain that is watering the Magician's garden, direct a jet stream upwards till it is over the head of The Magician; then let it wash gently over the Magician in streams of peaceful blue like a gentle rain AFFIRMATION: I am an eternal selfhood living within the ocean of life. I gather the knowledge from the universal subconsciousness as I require it. I return to this ocean of subconsciousness my own experiences, adding to the treasures of God, thereby. Within me is the knowledge of the unity of life; within me is the power of rapport. I give up and hand over to the Higher Self, which is in charge of my eternal self- consciousness, the control of the subconscious substance of me, No more need I react blindly or unconsciously to the forces of strife. I can now walk in peace--live in serenity. The transmutation of mv essence is assured."}]
