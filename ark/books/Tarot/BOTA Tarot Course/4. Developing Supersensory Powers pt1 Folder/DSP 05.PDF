[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 5 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures We must analyze further the ideas that are involved with the release of the creative aspect of subconscious power, In order to understand the ereative aspect, we have to be able to see how it is that we have been using it. We have to become more self-attentive. If you want to have a friend, you must learn how to be a friend; if you want to be loved, you must learn how to love. Everything that we want to be and do requires us to be in a happier state than we are now and promises us that state. Something within us reaches for a happier state. To those who say, \"All I want is spiritual development,\" we reply that this is all that is worth wanting, but when we do not understand what spiritual development is, we make the mistake of immediately giving negative suggestions to subconsciousness in terms of control of our environment. Attaining to the spiritual state has to do with controlling our environment through control of our thinking and feelingl we have to learn how to direct them and to understand the subtleties that are involved in this. We can learn to understand them only as we work with them. That is why it is so important to set ourselves the goal of being something, and then acting toward that goal' The proper goal always involves things. Nothing happens in the physical world that does not involve change or rearrangement or creation of a new type of thing. The reason that we are here on earth is to learn how to manipulate the energies that create things. A mountain is a thing. A creatr-tre is thing. A tree is a thing, Being creative in subconsciousness implies recognition that we must apply these energies to changes in our environment. This is the way of attainment to the highest spiritual levels and to transmutation of the personality. How can we experience fulfillment in love if we do not know how to love? Many people walk around lonely for love, and that could be the goal for them. The moment a person says, \"I want love,\" with knowledge and deliberation, the creative power is released and floods in. Remember the woman who meditated on a husband and found other women's husbands pursuing her. It is necessary to learn how the subtleties are related to the wants, so if we say, \"I want love,\" we know what we are saying. What we receive will be in terms of our own personalit-v level, for we project it outward and bring back in from others the kind of relationships that we ourselves determine subconsciously. The reason we do not recognize this is only because we have not seen into the way we have created subconsciously! Every one wants love. Those who say that they do not are afraid. They have been disappointed and are bitter; but they still want it, because they feel emotion about it. They cry \"sour grapes\" because they yearn for the grapes and have them not. We all want lovel no matter how much we have, we want more . If you think that you do not, you should have your heart examined because there is a sickness there. When we want love, every want reaches out as a line of force and makes contact within the being of those who are suited to respond. So, if you have not developed your personality into something truly mature, and project \"I want love,\" God help you, for you will receive whatyou are,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 5 In speaking of creative consciousness like this, we are trying to show you how not to release Pandora's Box and how to understand what has happened if you do. You cannot, under any circumstances, help wanting love, nor can you eradicate this want from your system, But if you want love, you must realize that you must be love and do love. You must learn what it is to be loving, You must move into action in terms of these ideas, act true lovingness, learn and express love, for what we are' we experience. If you want to know the kind of negative things that you have been thinking and feeling in the past, all you have to do is to study what happens to you for about a month. Keep a record, and discover what patterns repeatedly come to you in terms of people and environment. If you cannot analyze this presently, you certainly will learn as you work with Tarot. You will not learn in a day; it is a gradual unfolding like a blossom, Anyone who promises you the secrets of life and attainment immediately is either self-deluded or attempting to delude you. True intelligence must recognize that you can't learn how to hold your mind and your emotions in conscious directed areas overnight, You can receive instructions in doing it, but no one can eat your food for you. You have to do your own chewing, and until you do, you cannot begin to be worthy of spiritual experience. Occult aspirants owe it to life and to God to learn what the laws of consciousness are and to work with them so that they can live the Life, express the Life, and change the Life as it needs to be changed. Anyone who is in a consistently negative environment needs to understand that there is something wrong with his thinking or feeling, not wrong in the sense of \"evil, \" but wtong in the sense of \"incorreet, \" cf not un'lerstanding the mothods and the means of handling subconseious power. Love is what we all want, no matter how much love we have. By love we mean being loved by people, being accepted, feeling accepted. Remember that if we do not accept others as they are, they will not accept us as we are. If we think about others in unloving ways, all of these things will return to us. When we decide that we want love or anything else, we must immediately ask, \"How qualified am I for this expression, experience and fulfillment?\" No one is perfectly qualified, because no one has attained to Infinite Perfection. No matter what qualities we think we have, we can always improve. Therefore, if we wish to attract companionship, love, or the ability to operate in any sphere, we must determine how qualified we are--and we must be honest with ourselves. We must set down on paper those aspects of ourselves which we admire and those we don't admire. We may be mistaken about our assets and liabilities, but by attempting to discover them we have made a start in self-discovery. Truly experiencing God demands first experiencing ourselves as we really are in our personalities. It is not that one cannot have a flash of union with God under certain conditions, but we are speaking of steadfast knowledge, constant and regular in our living patterns, not of the wonderful glimpses of Grace that can come to any and all of us, espeeially if we work and reach for that Grace to help us toward our goal. When we ask ourselves how qualified we are, we discover that most of us are not really qualified for the highest and most beautiful aspects of love. We all are enamored of our mental processes, our intellectual prowess, and think that they are better than those of others. Likewise we have a tendency to be enamored of what we call our unselfish nature,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERST 5 3 when often it is not unselfish at all, You cannot understand all of the intricacies of your nature until you work consciously with the techniques that we shall give you in this course. Even with the techniques to use, you will have to contend with the Principle of Inertia and learn to use it properly. We all suffer from inertia. A New Year's resolution lasts an hour, a week, or a day. He who has kept a resolution for longer than a week is almost a miracle worker. Inertia is one of the great problems in attaining to anything. The Principle of Inertia is one of the universal laws, and in the esoteric teaching it is understood and accepted that one has to partake of the pairs of opposites in order to have consciousness at all. The basic opposition and polarities is between the principle that expands and the principle that contracts or constricts. Self-consciousness itself is a contraction of the univeisal principle of consciousness because of its concentration. When we concentrate, we limit our attention to a specific sphere. By limiting it, we become aware of the smaller relationships in areas of consciousness, which makes contraction a glorious thing, because it is through the ability to limit the awareness to areas that we have the ability to see variations and color and experience the miracle of form. Never think of this principle as an evil; it is not. Every principle has its extremes, and it is in the extremes that the problems lie. In our need and desire and aspiration to release the creative subconsciousness, we become enmeshed in the extreme of inertia, principle of contraction, heaviness. It is the inertia that gives us the ability to experience Self in a physical vehicle and a physical universe, wiih all of its glory and beauty. But we need to understand the principle so it does not keep us unbalanced, mired in the rut of habit. This is where inertia becomes a problem. Anyttring that hangs on, clings, is heavy and pulls, is one of the expressions of ihis principle of inertia, the principle of contraction which comes from the Cosmic Mother. Tarot Key 3, The Empress, which depicts creative consciousness, also portrays this other principle of the feminine aspect of God. The beauty of creativitSr comes from inertia. It helps us bring things into creation and to change one set of conditions for another. But the use of the cieative principle is always impeded by the negative aspects of inertia that keeps us where we arer like a needle stuck in one groove of the record. We find our minds going round and round in an habitual pattern; we find our emotions reacting over and_over to hanituul patterns; we find ourselves doing that which we have always done in an habitual pattern. Even this has its glorious side. If we did not let subconsciousness take control in order to t5rpe, for instance, we should have to use conscious methods to place every finger. We apply the consciousness, the principle of contraction, to set a pattern into subconsciousness. Anything that we do habitually was once learned through conscious attention and concentration. Then it became the habitual. Some habitual things we need. It would be extremely inconvenient if we had to think of each leg's motion before we put it forward in walking. Subconsciousness receives the habitual efforts as we learn to balance ourselves as infants. The principle of habit, which is an aspect of inertia, is good except that it keeps us from progtessing to the next pattern. That is where the problem arises with most of us. We become held down by yesterday, so that today we work yesterday over and over."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 5 Tomorrow the same thing happens with few variations. If we study the patterns of our lives, most of us will find that we have made the same mistakes repeatedly. We have been caught in the inertia of an old habit pattern, because we have not transmuted it. The only way to transmute the old habit patterns, to release ourselves from the inertia of the old, to bring about the creation of the new, consciously working with evolution and change, is to apply our conscious minds to goals that in the past have been frustrations. The things that have brought us sorrow are the things that we decide upon for goals, in order to discover the habit pattern and transmute it. We cannot expect to do this overnight; but the more intensity of emotion we put into it, the more quickly it will occur. We must have help. Merely looking for habit patterns as a matter of principle, as an abstract exercise, will not work. That is the reason that we give you the Tarot and the Qabalah for guides. That is the reason that we have grades of unfoldment in our work. You have been given all of these tools in your lessons to work with, but there are other levels of the work that must include meditation together in higher levels of mutual aspiration. This we are affording you through this course, to enable you to grasp the principle of inertia and to focus yourself properly. Through the common effort of all, no matter where you may be, you are helped to overcome the deeper aspects of your inertia. These age-old methods always work, given time and perseverance. The help is there to help you, for helping you is another way of helping to lift the hurden frorn hurnanity. 11 helps tc lift pert of the inertia from every hurnan being who manages to break through one important old pattern, to break away into a new expression, a new development, a new capacity to love, a new capacity to be and to do. That human being is then serving humanity. You would realize there is no need to dramatize lhe unhappy patterns of yesterday if you knew how dramatically and gloriously you can serve by doing something with yourself, by removing just one pressure that keeps you frustrated, fixed, miserable, or uncreative. The secret of releasing the creative subconscious energies to the fullest is to work to release the negative habit patterns of thinking. This we shall discuss in more detail in the next lesson."}]
