[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 6 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In this lesson we shall examine some of the occult teachings that relate to the art of self-direction, which is the secret of genius. This follows logically from the previous lesson in which we stressed the importance of the question, \"What do I want?\" We asked you to meditate on this seriously, and we pointed out to you that in occultism, as in an5rthing, the vital essential is to decide what you want to be and to do. Those who fail to decide, continue to meander, victims of past subconscious patterns, reliving the same patterns over and over, making the same mistakes, weeping the same tears. These go on choosing the same unsuitable relationships, living a life of bitterness, often hating humanity. And one who hates humanity hates himself. You would be surprised how common this tendency is, even in the hearts of those who aspire to know. To the degree that we have contempt for ourselves, for our own abilities, or lack of abilities, for our own apparent failures, to that degree do we look upon ourselves with hatred. If we febl this way about ourselves, as surely as night follows day, we cannot help reacting in the same way to those around us. The result is that we attract hateful experiences from people; we attract them by that radiating level of the mechanism that we are. Those who have the capacity to tune into what we are radiating, respond and play back to us the things that we feel; self-hatred, frustration, betrayal. Indeed, in these few sentences are perhaps the most important reasons occult and rrieiaphysical studenis fail in demonstrating the things ihey want, seem to fail to find the fulfilled life, seem to fail to live the radiant beauty that we are all destined to live, sooner or later. When that time comes, be it in a day, week or month, or a hundred life times, it will have been worthwhile. Nevertheless, we are weary of our persistent problems. Yet, even the indulgence of permitting oneself to feel weary projects something serious in terms of what one will experience. So we need to know what the principles are that are involved in the true art of self-direction. In other words, we must become consciously aware of exactly what is necessary to attract to our personal environment those elements in our nature, those experiences, those fulfillments that make for a fuller life. FUemember that if a true spiritual aspirant holds the idea that he is not seeking personal happiness, that all he wants is to find God, he is using spiritual ideas and principles as an escape mechanism, because he has no faith in his powers. Those who truly want to find God, those who truly know the principles involved in Union with the Most High, will recognize that it is our duty to become perfected instruments in and through which the Divine can function and live. This is our role, and if we are to be perfected instruments in and through which the Higher Genius, the Higher Self, the Higher Soul, God, can live and act, we must stop feeling and creating and emanating endleisly those elements in our personalitSr that make the personality, the instrument, imperfect. The sorrows that we have are due to the fact that we are ignorant of the true principles; this is unfortunately true of even many highly developed occultists. It is true of them because they have been seduced by the occult schools of thought, the eastern thought in particular, which stresses the idea of escape from life. He who wishes to escape from life to reach God merely wants to retire from the responsibility of perfecting his instrument! One can do this for a short time, but he will lose this particular"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 6 magical instrument when he dies, drops the vehicle, and will discover then that all that he has done is to postpone for innumerable life times that Union he sought, In the end perhaps this will not matter, but it matters to us here. We need, for the sake of evolution, to do something effective. The Inner School, the Masters of Wisdom who stand behind our particular system of training in Builders of the Adytum, the Tarot, the Qabalistic way of return, have evolved in us various grades, from the exoteric to the most secret ritualistic and ceremonial arcana of magic. The Master of Wisdom in charge of our work has said to us often that there is a vital, serious, indeed, tragic need for more centers to be developed among the individuals of humanity to emanate creative thoughts, thoughts of love, fulfilled thoughts; that this is the most important thing that we have to do in this era. We are in that period of a cycle in which untold numbers of souls have been manifested, as you can see from the great increases in the world's population. Untold numbers of souls have flocked in from previous life experiences in which they did not evolve. These have had to wait for another suitable period. There are also many more souls than usual incarnating at once from our own evolutionary class. Several generations of souls are manifesting at once, not taking rests on the astral as usual, because the dividing point in this cycle is about to come. Some will be able to go on to the next evolutionary development for humanity, perfected humanity. Some will not be able to pass to the next level of evolution. The factor which determines whether ot nof orid mal<es the grade in this division which is taking place now is one's ability to work with his own mental and emotional nature and the ability to feel the Unity of Life. It may surprise you to hear that many atheists have this ability to a much higher degree than some aspirants. Though they have many problems as a result of their atheism, this does not preclude their possessing the ability to handle their own mental and emotional natures and the ability to feel the Unity of Life. What do we mean by feeling the Unity of Life? If you hate yourself and others, you are certainly not feeling the Unity of Life. Although you may not come to see it constantly, it has to be something that rises in your heart much and often. Compassion for the suffering of others, compassion for the suffering of anything that lives is part of the Unity of Life. The unity of all, whether we are aware of it or not, is fixed on the subconscious level. Within this we all live and move and have our being, so that there is nothing which anyone thinks or feels that does not affect everyone else! What, then, must we do to learn how to handle the mental and emotional nature? The one thing that we must not do is exemplified in the story of the dogmatic New Thought practitioner who was asked what he was doing in Hell. He rose up arrogantly and replied, \"I am not here!\" When we refuse to admit the situation in our minds or hearts, we are not dealing with it. We are merely trying to escape it by denying it. You do not deny what is there. You cannot transmute through denial. You transmute something by putting its opposite in its place! \"The modifications of the mind are to be overcome by their opposites\"\" This sounds easy, but those of us who have tried it have discovered that it is not as easy as it sounds. If you have ever been promised the mastery of everybhing under"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 6 the sun, including the sources of nature, in six easy lessons, you will have discovered that it is not that simple. All we can say to you is that it can be done, and that there are ways and methods that make it a certainty but do not make it easy. It is a certainty in time, if you persevere, if you stay with it, if you make up your mind thatyou are going to be able to overcome, to change, to transmute the patterns within you that hold you in the old shell, make you the old creature instead of the new creature. It is the new creature that we must become, even though we need not perfect it in this incarnation, although some of us could if we desired enough. This is why we want you to decide what you want, because everybhing is a matter of want! If you do not desire illumination enough, you will not work for it. Learning to handle your mind and emotions depends on wanting to. You have to discover how wants and desires operate in order to understand them enough to be able to transmute them properly. That is why it is essential to work with actual wants. Remember that in Qabalah it is taught that every want that we have is a gift from God. Desire is not something to be eliminated or overcome or killed. If you kill desire, you will be a walking shell. Desire is the gift of God. The yearning that overflows the heart is a promise. It means that this yearning is what our hearts and souls will push toward for the next fulfillment in our evolution. That is why everyone who yearns for Cosmic Consciousness 'will certainly achieve it, though vcry fe',v rr,'ill achieve it in this incarnation. Ho';r fal you achieve depends on your intensit5r, on how well you have learned to work consciously with the different whirling energies in your own nature. Hence, you must train yourself in the art of self-direction, and the only way to train yourself in self-direction is to decide on a direction in which you will go, By now, you should understand better why we ask you to give so much attention to what you want. Once the direction in which you want to go is chosen, it does not matter what immediate goal you decide upon, because from one goal, you go to the next and the next. Some of us have in mind vast goals, vital things. Nevertheless, we have to decide on a first step toward those goals, Nothing is an inferior way of serving God. In the development of our true genius, that which we all have, we must decide to train ourselves consciously, to realize that every act that we perform is holy, glorious, and a service to God. This is the way in which our genius is developed, our self-conscious genius. The self-conscious direction has to do with a complete change in our attitudes as to how important little things are; it has to do with learning how to watch what we think and feel. Regarding as unimportant the miracles that lie all around us dulls our awareness of the wonder that exists. The fact is that every single human being is a unique genius. When you begin to recognize this it will have an opportunity to express itself. Opportunities will come to you for developing those areas in your nature that need development for further expression. How is it that every human being is a unique genius? Look at it from the scientific point of view. Everyone of us began with a set of genes different from those of any other person except, apparently, in the case of identical twins. This is only apparent, because one"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 6 side of the common ovum was different from the other side of it; it was a mirror image but not identical. Every one of us grew by division. That is the way in which God works. God begets us from Himself, and our bodies are formed from something minute, in physical terms, and grows by division We think of life as an addition of something to something, but the addition comes about through division. The single beginning becomes two, and the two divide in turn, because of the livingness in them, because of the Divine Creative Life Power. Something in you knows you and knows exactly what to do and build to keep this miracle alive. Each divided part divides again in geometric progression. The result is organized in a special way, for every human being has an organization, dependent on genes and chromosomes, which is completely different from that of any other person. Each is a precious uniqueness that nothing in the universe can duplicate. This includes your enemy, though it is hard to believe that your enemy can be that precious, too! Every human being is a uniquely precious thing, precious in the same way that every child is precious to its parents, but infinitely more precious in that way to God. No matter what qualities another human being may seem to have in terms of ability or power, no one is able to see life, to see form, to react to form, to experience, to feel, to love, in exactly the same way that you can, This is your unique livingness and your genius. Hence, you should not want to be like any other person. If you want to be like another, you are not wanting to be completely and wholly \"I,\" that Divine I which is unique for each and every one of us, even though we are all united in the One. . That is the paradox of the One aqd lhe Mqny, It is because of the uniqueness of each individual that psychoanalysis is of little or no help in removing the inertia, ridding us of the old patterns. In analytic procedures, not until the analyst becomes aware of the patient's problems can the analyst help the patient. The patient in this sense transfers his problems to the analyst. You cannot transfer to another individual any of your problems. Each individual is unique. Therefore, Qabalah is a self-analytical technique, to enable you to melt down, transmute and reform into creative form the energies that reside in you. We do, admittedly, need something to lean on, but what is wrong with God? Make your transference to God! At whatever evolutionary level you are, blame God for the age that you are, for that is why you make mistakes. Instead of hating yourself, try to learn from the immature elements within yourself. This is the way we grow more rapidly. Occultism is a hothouse, an enforced growth process. It is an attempt to speed up evolution that would otherwise take many incarnations. Occult training, the whole system of the training in the Mysteries, is an attempt to narrow the time period of growth as one does with plants in a hothouse. That is what we work toward. Those of us who have wept enough tears or felt enough compassion are ready to fill the rest with yearning and desire to serve Life. If you cannot know thatyou are serving Life and feel the joy of living Life when you are engaged in the lowliest task, you are certainly not prepared to serve in larger ways. I have been trained by the Inner School to channel its energies to you, to help intensify your nature and your realization, and my words are more or less a bridge over which the emotional knowledge travels. Not until we know a thing emotionally do we know it at alMntellectual knowing is important, Qabalah stresses the importance of developing"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 6 the mental faculties, for without them we have no discrimination, no way of guiding ourselves or those who are put in our care with discrimination. The development of the mind is essential, but without the feelins nature it is nothing. It is cold; it has no force, no ftre, no real power. It is in the emotional nature that the power resides. That is another reason that we want you to work with your desires, rather than try to run away from them, to learn how to utilize this powerhouse toward true fulfillment of everything in your own personal sphere of destiny, and to do it more quickly than the slow evolutionary process allows. In directing yourself, you first have to know what you want. Then you must decide on the ways and methods of going toward what you want. For instance, suppose you decide that what you want is love. Of course, love is something that we all want. Even if you have it, you should want more of it. There cannot be too much love in the heart. When you reach the point at which you feel a flow of love that embraces all of life, you have achieved the primary goal. But in seeking love, you must use discrimination. If your goal is love, you must, by occult principles, recognize this; we attract the kind of love that we are, appearances to the contrary. If you want love because you are lonely, what you really want is to assuage loneliness. If you are insecure, your nature will embrace either possessiveness or jealousy, because they stem from insecurity. If you do not feel secure,youhave to clingto someone, to make anotheryour stable life principle. If you are jealcus, ycu are afraid that scnecne else ...ril! take thie prcp a1vay. Both reCuce tc insecurill in relation to yourself. This is why we stress so much the importance of loving yourself, loving yourself in the way that God loves you. Unfortunately, most of us reach out for love, not because we are overflowing with the fulfilling joyousness of love, but because we feel a yearning lack, and as a result this yearning lack is what we emanate. These are very subtle principles and are the things we need to transmute. Now, how does one deal with this yearning lack? First of all, we need to examine ourselves. We need to use discrimination, to use our minds. If we want to attract love, we must make of ourselves individuals who deserve love. We need to see what qualities we have that emanate to life so as to bring back the experience of love. We must analyze ourselves, quality by quality, and watch and act. If you ask what we are going to do about it, that is where the Tarot techniques and the Tree of Life apply; these are the systems that help us to do something about it. If we try to work with our own personalities, we shall not succeed. This is one of the reasons for so many failures, that we announce to subconsciousness that we have our own personal roles, or our own personal powers to work it. Personal power and personal will are nothing. But when we say, \"The Divine Will works in and through me,\" and mean it, we open ourselves to the influx of all of the riches of the universe, the Cosmic Flow, to give us the fire, the force, the abilities, and the capacity to transmute that in our nature that requires it. We must learn how to be honest with ourselves if we wish to attain to spiritual illumination!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 6 We must be honest with ourselves if we wish to attain to the personal experiences of love. We have to learn how to comprehend what it is that we have and are. When we examine the concept of love, it becomes more than a spiritual thing as we usually think of spiritual things. We can see it in many practical applications that lead to living a more enlightened and less frustrating life. This same principle enables us to find fulfillment in the apparently more practical goals such as the required securit5r involved in expressing ourselves in the commercial world. In our next lesson, we shall discuss the various aspects of love, what love is and is not, what it parades as, what problems arise in love, whether it be for family, for lover, for spouse, or for humanity in general."}]
