[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 7 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures Let us recapitulate what we have said in our earlier lessons. We have come to agree that it is absolutely vital to decide on a goal\" We have to know what it is we want to be and do; otherwise there is nothing toward which to strive, nothing toward which to work; we wander in a maze, accomplishing nothing. We must have goals because they provide the discipline that consciousness must utilize. In a sense, they create the hedge of protection symbolized in Key 7, the area of consciousness in which we develop and evolve our self-conscious control and powers. We do this by setting ourselves goals. The first vital thing that we must do, then, is to choose what we want to be and do. This must, of necessity, involve the development of whatever it is that our talents seem to indicate. If we are mistaken about our talents, we shall soon discover it. Even if we are mistaken, it is good to work at our goals and the occult principles involved, because we shall, at worst, discern what it is that we do not want to be and do. Together we have examined the emotional aspects of these goals and found that unless we have emotion behind our goals, we have not the fuel to move toward them. Desire alone is the impetus to motion. In occultism, desire is understood to be the drive that comes from the Infinite Itself. from God Himself--the drive that goads us into experiences, so that we shall evolve our mental and emotional nature through the environmental influences that develop as a result of experiences into which our desires push us. In this evolving, we develop an insight into our nature and the nature of others. We are able to ehoose more suitable and harmonious goals, sc'\"ye can anticipate in r','hat direction we shall run upon the rocks. We find ourselves reaching our goals with greater ease as we develop insight into what it is that we are really working toward and learn how to eliminate our delusions. This we do only through experience! In this lesson we shall try to analyze what love is and the various types of love that appear to exist, the different drives; to seek what love is and is not, and what it means in terms of our being and doing and reaching our goals. Love brings its influence to bear on everything, as we shall show you, because whatever it is that we want to be and do, it all involves other people, relationships. You cannot live without relationships! You cannot even be selfish by your self'! Nothing can be accomplished alone, not even selfishness. You can't steal by yourself; there is always someone to whom the thingyou have stolen belongs. A relationship is inexorably involved. Nothing can be done alone. We are all related whether we like it or not. If we do not like it, we had better learn to like it, because we are linked with each other as living centers of life. Indeed, those who achieve the higher stages of insight rejoice in this fact. Whatever we want is going to involve other people! It is not a good idea to meditate or concentrate on money, to make money the goal, because money is a generalization. People who want money usually want it to buy some thing. The thing itself should be the goal. You never know how a thing is going to come. Do not limit yourself by wanting money. Always remember that money is a medium of exchange of goods and services."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 7 We must learn how to work with positive pictures of actual accomplishments or we will not bring our pictures to fruition or experience a fulfillment in any way. It is only through relationships that we ever progress, Even the occult aspirant who meditates alone on his navel is working with ideas that come to him from other people, and is therefore related to other people. It is curious that this type of person who imagines himself evolved rarely realizes that the evolution of consciousness and the experience of higher states of consciousness comes down through a group of transmission stations and involves other people. That is why we have, on the Tree of Life, the relation of force from Kether to Malkuth. The Sephiroth are stages of consciousness to which various individuals have achieved. Everything flows through these transmission stations and is stepped down or up. In experiencing something on spiritual levels, whether we are aware of it or not, we actually tune into those souls who have achieved the higher states, and our enerry is stepped up because we are all one. We are all One Being. Just as all ofthe organs ofthe body are dependent on the flow ofblood and on the condition of the blood, in the same way we are dependent on the flow of force, which is in a sense the blood stream of life that pours in and through the individuals who have achieved various states, and this includes the beings of the angelic kingdom, The expressions of force that are called angels or archangels are also centers of consciousness which have certain functions in and for life, and they are involved in everything that occurs to us, just as we are involved. It is a system of complete inter-circulation. In terms of our own personal goals, if we recognize that whatever it is that we want to be and do involves our relationships in life, we shall know that the most vital thing we must do is to work on our relationships, on understanding them and perfecting them. This, of course means that we have to work on ourselves! A person who wants love, who makes love his goal, must realize that in order to have love he must know how to give love, You have to qualify yourself to be able to experience the kind of love that you hold as an ideal. Many people hold only the selfish idea that they want someone to worship them, to put them on a pedestal, or think of them as a God or Goddess. They never stop to think, \"Am I a God or Goddess? Am I so perfected as a personalif,5r that I should be on a pedestal?\" God pity them! Do we not all run from them as from the plague? Such persons cannot make proper relationships. They live bitter, lonely lives within themselves. It is an unhappy state to be in love with aspects of one's being that do not exist. At the same time, we have to fall in love with ourselves if we are going to have anyone else fall in love with us. This is where the problem comes in with everyone to some degree or another, with some more acutely than others, We must have a good opinion of ourselves, to feel that we are kind and unselfish. Society supplies us with our ideals, and if subconsciously or consciously we feel that we do not measure up to these ideals, we hold ourselves in contempt. This attitude is projected to our contacts and acts as a repellent to much good that might otherwise be ours. Often we fail to recognize wherein we have failed. It is at this point that many people who have been in metaphysics come to B.O.T.A. Those who see that something is wTong with the theories that they have learned come to us hoping we can help them to find out what is wrong with the system of training they have followed. When you find out what is wrong and what is right with yourself, you begin truly"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 7 B to develop the mental powers that you must develop. In the evolutionary scheme, it is your duty, as a child of God, to develop your highest potential. Whether you walk willingly or have to be dragged, you will come to this self-evaluation sooner or later. Our relationship values depend on what we really think of ourselves. not what we sa-'r that we are! When we play-act, we become lost behind the mask and think that we are the mask, because it is important to us to think well of ourselves. Emotionally, we are not really thinking well of ourselves at all, and this is the real light, the emanation that is given out. We must learn how to differentiate between the mask we play at being and what we really are. It is when we are deluded that we think we are our mask, the group of characteristics trained into us by home, sociefr, our teachers, and the books we have read. Having a mask, a persona, is not evil. In the eastern tradition, one is told that he must dissolve the persona, but in Qabalah one is told quite the opposite. We need this personality. Indeed, God has gone to a great deal of trouble to develop it. It is the personality that is the instrumental center of expression. What we need to know is the difference between \"I\" and the personality! Then we shall be able to examine the traits in the personality more objectively; we shall be able to make the personalit5r something lovely in terms of what it emanates. Then we shall experience fulfillment wherever we go, whatever we touch, whatever our eyes look upon, whatever our heart yearns toward; it will come easily when we have learned to know what we are and are not and begin to reject the delusions. What is love? We have the love of the parent for the child, a strong love, The lion or wolf or monkey will risk life again and again to protect its offspring. This is a universal love, experienced at every level of life. Therefore, we cannot congratulate ourselves that we are wonderful parents, although we should be grateful for the experience of parental love. It is a wondet, and we must not let ourselves lose the wonder, but it is nothing of which we personally should be vain, Most parents, with the best intentions in the world, could not be worse parents if they tried. They do not have enough wisdom, do not understand enough the values of relationships. Our love for our children is nothing unique; even the creatures in the field share it. It may be that members of the animal kingdom are better parents than we, for they have no delusions and hence no masks to come between them and their children. Love between spouses is another relationship. When two people marry in our culture, they marry, in theory, because they have fallen in love. The next question is, what does it mean to fall in love? It means that you are temporarily and gloriously insane, as the world views sanity. I feel sorry for those who have never been insane in this way. It is painful, but he who cannot submit to the pain must \"pass out of Love's threshing floor into the passionless world, where he will laugh, but not all of his laughter, and weep, but not all of his tears.\" Without love, life is not intense and full, so it is worth the risk of pain and sorrow. Some say that love is an immature emotion, that those who love are unevolved. This is the \"sour grapes\" attitude. Anyone who says that being in love indicates immaturity has been disappointed in love; and having discovered that there are other kinds of loving in which one is not so acutely wretched if things go wrong, decides that he has outgrown this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 7 nonsense. Life will teach him. The wind bloweth where it listeth. whether we will or not. If any experience has to happen to us, it will happen. Some of us have the capacity to fall in love many times. Strangely enough, each time we look back and say, \"That was not really love, those other times; it was infatuation.\" The present love is always the true love; and if we were in love in the past and it did not work out, it was only infatuation. Infatuation is always part of love, whether it is present or past. When you are in love, the one problem that you have not is concentration. Try not to concentrate on the beloved and see what happens. Pull your mind away a thousand times and always it swings back, focused and one-pointed. If you have ever been in love and that was not so, you were not really in love or it was a very mild love. You need to develop more intensit5l, more courage to let yourself go, to discover what happens in the livingness of the emotions, what amazing power we have, and to utilize it in positive ways. Love has an extraordinary effect on the body. When one loves, his face shines, his skin glows, v€ry like what happens when one experiences cosmic consciousness. Can it be that falling in love has a relationship to cosmic consciousness? No one is too old to fall in love, or too young; behold the agony of heart and soul and joy that go on in a four-year old when he falls in love - as children do. When I was five I had an absolute passion for Ramon Navarro, the motion picture actor. I adored him. We can be in love at any age. Why say that it is not love? It is, for that age, The capacity for that age to lose itself in adoration and worship is an aspect of love. Psychologists try to explain \"being in love\" as merely a biological urge to procreate, One has this urge biologically, merely that, They down-grade this lovely insanity and many people accept their view and repeat the same nonsense. They confuse love with lust. The sex urge can be satisfied with any member of the opposite sex. To the lover, only the beloved is acceptable. We must understand the relationships to reach our goals. If we do not know where to channel our emotions, how to channel them, and what to do with our emotional reactions, they will break us. Whatever the goal may be, they will continue to break us until we have learned to understand and channel them. We all yearn to fall in love; there is magic in life when one loves. When one is with the beloved, he sees the sun shining. If you have never seen the sun shining in your beloved's face, fall in love now as an aspirant and see what happens. Your emotions become intensified through this work; whatever your nature is it becomes that much more strong. That is why you need that much more understanding to know how to control and direct your emotions and not to be washed into tragic situations. Some are apparently broken on the wheel of love, but they come out the better for it if they do not develop bitterness and if they understand what it was in themselves that made the unhappy experience. Sometimes falling in love lasts, and sometimes it is temporary. One is no less holy than the other, In our culture, we are told that only when you fall in love lastingly is it truly love, truly holy. This is like saying that atoms that come together to form elements"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 7 temporarily are less holy than atoms that form stable elements. One is no less holy than the other. Relationships between some people are like the ships that pass in the night because that is the karmic relationship. These can be intense, a close passage. Some people link forces so that the ships are chained together, moving against each other, and sometimes the chains are very heavy. They wonder how in the world they could have fallen in love with each other. They live lives of regret and frustration and emanate such. This emanation creates difficulties in terms of their goals, because when a frustration is emanated, others pick it up. No matter what the goal, if we emanate frustrations they interfere with the accomplishment of it. To overcome this is real mastery. If anyone tells you that you can become a Master by sitting and meditating, without living and reacting and responding, try it, and when you are quite weary you will be willing to do it the easy way, which is the apparently hard way. Falling in love, whether it be brief or one of the glorious lifelong links that may repeat incarnation after incarnation, is the Grace of God. Whether you are in love for five minutes, flrve days or forever, it is an approach to the Divine. When you fall in love, you see something glorious and beautiful in the beloved. Love is said to be blind. It is quite the opposite. When you are in love the veils are torn away. You look into a pair of eyes and see something to worship. When you are in love it seems all too brief, even if it is for a lifetime. The veils are down: vou are seeing the Divine Soul. Problems with love arise beeat-rse we funetion in and through personalities. If the personalities are not on a like spiritual, mental and emotional level of development, there is a clash between dissimilar personalities, Although we are all one Being and should love and accept and understand one another as individuals, our talents vary. Some may be at the same level spiritually but completely different in orientation. The real problem arises when the spiritual levels are different . . . yet we have talked ourselves into falling in love. This is not real love. One does not talk himself into true love; it just happens and not always at first sight. Suddenly the veils are drawn back, We look at each other through thick veils before and after love. They swing closed when the personalities cannot function in unison. Personalifr differences arise because lovers cannot function harmoniously, but they are not evil. When you feel resentment toward someone because he did not live up to the ideal image you projected upon him, you must realize that the image was your work and that you must love the individual for what he is and not what you would have him be. Those who apparently betrayed us were able to do so because we have not yet developed enough discrimination to recognize that personalities differ. There are some chemicals that one simply cannot mix. Either they will not form in compound or they form a toxic or explosive substance when put together. Yet, as chemicals, they are innocent of evil intent. Most of us have had at least one experience of projecting to another things that we wanted him to be but which he was not, and we have been hurt. We have to understand what to do and what not to do when in love. What to do with our own reactions in order to safeguard ourselves when meeting clashing personalities that cannot form the stable union we are reaching for. Some can transfer their disappointments into another area of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 7 accomplishment and cease to feel frustration. They have channeled their emotion and desire into another field. The ramifications of what love is and is not form an important topic in occultism. We have to fall in love with ourselves in order to have real power! Until we fall in love with ourselves, we have no capacity to have the true love experience, to fall in love in such a way as to include true spiritual and mystical union between the partners and the utilization of the love energ/ to attain to powers beyond comprehension. This can be, but very few are remotely ready for such an experience, because few understand relationships and emotional reactions and how to use them to prepare themselves for this experience. The Kundalini power, the sex enerry, is the enerry that awakens and develops powers of consciousness and develops the emotional nature. It is vital to understand this in order to utilize it most effectively. Most of us have been too well trained in the guilt complexes of our culture. The lovers in our Key 6 stand naked and unashamed with the angel over them. If we want fulfilled love, we must learn how to love, or we shall not receive it. We have to know what giving means in order to truly receive. There are states and intensities of love that extend into larger vistas. When we hear talk of transmuting these energies, few of us know what is meant, Most people think that transmutation means killing the enerry. It does not. If you kill your emotional power' your engine, how can you get anywhere? This is the energ' through which you have cosmic consciousness' It may well be that the state of love, no matter how terri$ring some of its results are, is the very thing that quickens the nature into a grbater aliveness. We must learn to utilize and understand this power properly. Even if it does nothing but train us in concentration, it is a very effective tool for the Life Power to use for the evolution of Its centers. We have to learn how to take charge of the energies within ourselves. Nothing teaches us relationship values more than the state of love; and love has many expressions, expresses many relationships. The love of friend for friend is one of the highest states in the universe, yet how many of us have it? We are so beset with the need to judge and condemn that we do not permit others to be our friends if they have the capacit;z, let alone give them friendship. True friendship accepts and loves. If you have not the capacity to give and take this kind of friendship, how can you expect to achieve your goal, since it is through relationships that all goals come into being? We have to learn to see clearly and yet accept with love. We have to learn not to expect others to be Masters of Wisdom. It is easy to run down the long list of others' failings. He who wishes a friend must learn how to be a friend. He who wishes love must learn how to love. He who wishes to achieve the spiritual goal must learn how to deal with his mental and emotional nature, to grow it. If you accept others with open eyes, you feel the better for it. You glow with love within yourself. Deep down we are a little bit in love with ourselves, and that is why we can afford to accept and love people as they are instead of as we think they should be. The lessons that you are receiving in this course and the techniques that you will be taught are all aimed at developing these abilities and insights and powers. They do not come overnight. One can develop the more important ones rapidly if he puts concentration"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 7 and desire into it as he would put concentration into falling in love. That is the kind of focus we require. How we should regard the quest for illumination, which is love, is beautifully expressed in the tale of the disciple and his master. They were walking by a river, and suddenly the master threw his disciple upon the ground and pushed his head under the water, holding it there. After what seemed an eternity, the disciple was released and came up gasping. The master said, \"What was your only thought as I held your head under water? \" The disciple replied, \"Master, all I could think of was air. \" The master smiled and said, \"When you become as desperate for illumination as you were for air, you will attain it. \" The degree of your desire is what determines the degree of your success in the important beings and doings, yet even that has subtle elements. . . the understanding of what you emanate and how to change it. You must learn how to emanate acceptance, good will, and friendship. You will do this when you understand yourself with more acceptance and good will. Think much more of yourself. Are you not the child of God? You must begin to see yourself as having miraculous potential and you must have faith in your ability to develop friendliness and lovingness. Others will have faith in you if you have faith in your potential. You can attain the glory and the heights of love only if you develop the ability and capacity to handle that kind of intense enerry and to give it. We are afraid to give of ourselves because we fear to be rejected. We are afraid to receive from others for fear we will be obligated, for fear that we do not deserve this $f!, or for reasons of pride. These are the things that we need to change in ourselves to have enough of the emotional power to achieve our goals. How many of us are gracious receivers? If we are not gracious receivers, how can we receive help in whatever way we need it from the other centers of life? If you project your own pridefulness, rejecting \"charit5r,\" remember that all of us are the \"receivers of the gift of life,\" and that all things come from God and not from another. Another is the instrument through which God gives the blessing. This is what is meant by humility. Humilify does not mean submitting to tyranny. This but strengthens the weakness in the tyrant and is not kindness to him. He who would receive must learn to be a receiver. Some of us say, \"I don't like to be selflrsh; I like to give. The only time I am happy is when I am giving to others.\" This is a fltne picture they have built up of their unselfishness. They are neglecting their bodies and their personalities, and they are not deserving of the glorious gift of life. They are also cheating others of the opportunity to give. The first responsibility that God gave you was that of taking proper care of that center, that instrument which you experience as \"you.\" True unselfishness does not know that it is being unselfish. True unselfishness gives the other the opportunity to feel h\"ppy in giving. For the rest of this week, examine the life pattern of this incarnation and write down the various gifts you have received from the Lord of Life in and through his instruments, remembering that sorrow as well as joy has been a gift; it has given you perception; aspiration, understanding."}]
