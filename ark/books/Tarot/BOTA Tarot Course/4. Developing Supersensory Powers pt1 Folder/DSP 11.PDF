[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 11 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures Superconsciousness is not explainable in words, but we can help point the way toward its attainment. The Inner School works with us through the forces of the Tarot keys, of the Tree of Life, of color and sound, in all of the courses we give. Personal disciples of Masters of Wisdom, who have been rigidly trained and disciplined, become, as it were, pipelines or channels emanating the knowledge of cosmic levels of wisdom and power. In other words, the Inner School and the Master who is its director, use the teacher- myself-to catalyze your spiritual aspirations. Also, by a type of osmosis, we help you to absorb certain ideas and perceptions gradually, which, without this special instruction, would take very much longer. Duringthis series many of you will experience flashes of realization and a heightening of your psychic faculties. These come inevitably to any true aspirant willing to persevere. Among other things, this course is aimed at transmitting to you certain intellectual perceptions that will become part of your permanent knowledge. As time goes on, you will gain more and more ability to utilize this knowledge and to expand it into greater powers of discrimination and perception. We expect that most of you who persevere will have quite a few expansions of consciousness, and we shall relate these to certain facts that you must understand. One cannot explain superconsciousness in self-conscious terms. The superconscious state is one of knowing all things at once and simultaneously. In the subconscious state there is a continuolls association of coneepts as a mcre cr less unconscious process. In the self-conscious state, the act of attention is focused on one particular thing at a time. You will notice that superconsciousness embraces and transcends the other two. In Tarot Key No. 0, The Fool, we have a figure standing on a mountain viewing a wide vista. Self-consciousness may be compared to a man who is in a valley and sees only a small portion of his environment. But if he climbs to the top of the mountain, his view will be all-encompassing. This is an imperfect analogr to superconscious awareness, but this awareness is the goal of all of us. When you drop your physical vehicle, the level of awareness that you have attained up to that point is the same awareness that you will take with you into the after-death state. You will not have glorious, ecstatic or rapturous consciousness unless you have first attained it while incarnated. This is the purpose of these lessons. We have often heard it said that God is Love, and the Fool does represent the power of love; but we will take up the essence of love with Tarot Key No. 3, The Empress, and show you how to develop actual awareness of a spiritual substance that flows between beings when they are in love, or are in loving contact with one another. The Fool, in essence, holds within himself the principle of all the Tarot keys. He is the beginning and the end. He is the superconscious intelligence that plans creation. The Fool carries his memory on his shoulder, but not as we too often carry it. Too often we carry memory with sighs, sorrow, bitterness and self-pity. The Fool carries his bag blithely and gaily, and the bag is the symbol of memory. He stands at the edge of the precipice, and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 11 if he takes one more step he will be in trouble, but he doesn't seem to know it. That is another of the reasons that he is called the fool. Those who are in touch with the Higher Self, even occasionally, rcalize that there is no such thing as a terrible cataclysm, however it may appear at the moment, Every sorrow can make you more beautiful. Every heartbreak develops greater compassion in you for others. Every disappointment develops in you greater intelligence. It is your attitude towards the situation that is important. Those who are tied to the world's materialistic point of view, correlating physical possessions with happiness, are the true poverty-stricken souls. They are at the mercy of their possessions and, therefore, cannot even remotely enjoy the miracle of physical form. That which seems to have been the most tragic in our lives, the experiences which have brought us the greatest disappointment and disillusionment, has in reality been our greatest treasure. Experience enriches and grows us, so that we can attain the higher levels of consciousness. We store up for ourselves more and more problems, more and more sorrows, when we continue to cling to the material idea of what is worthwhile. Our tradition does not teach that possessions themselves are evil, but that the lust for them and the importance we place upon them are. It is the mental and emotional attitude that matters here. We shall help you in these lessons toward developing the ability to enjoy heaven here on earth. You cannot expect to experience illumination in heaven if you haven't attained the capacity for it here on earth. We have come into physical manifestation for the purpose of evolving self-conscious awareness of superconsciousness. That which is superconsciousness to us is self-consciousness to the Masters of Wisdom. That which is superconsciousness to the animal is self-consciousness to us. The levels of consciousness exist in a hierarchy, and we control these levels by learning ho* to go up and down the planes as we need to. It is superconsciousness that must guide us all the way; superconsciousness belongs to the Higher Soul, the Eternal Being. This is what you really refer to whenyou say \"I,\" whetheryou are conscious of it or not. It is necessary to keep your attention on superconsciousness when practicing techniques that stimulate psychic faculties. This superconscious focus will keep you from being swept away by the rivers of subconsciousness, the astral illusions, or being mislead by mischievous elementals. Thus you will remain stable on the Path, walking courageously and joyfully through this adventureland. What you need to understand as you proceed on this particular adventure is basically this; the superconscious level of your being is, in itself, completely consciousl its activity is a development for Itself of conscious individual centers for greater and greater cosmic powers. This is what your superconscious level, your Higher Self, is doing with you, ac- cording to the Cosmic Plan. Just as a t5rpewriter cannot build itself, we as personalities are tools built by and for the Higher Self, which is nevertheless not something other than ourselvesl it is our true \"I.\" So many aspirants, when they hear of this concept, fear that they will lose their personalities if they are taken up into what is called \"All"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 11 Consciousness,\" the superconscious state. Nothingcan be farther from the truth. You cannot lose anything! The All has taken untold numbers of billions of years to evolve centers of awareness which we call our human consciousness, and these centers are precious beyond anything you can imagine. The next step for humanity, and it is particularly vital at this time, is to learn how to become actively conscious on the superconscious level. It is for this reason that we are evolving our higher faculties, so that we may have complete control of the psychic levels of our being, attaining the dominion which is our heritage. We see about us a world full of pain, and there is no denying that we have fears, that we have sorrows, that we feel isolated, and that we feel lonely. But none of these things is essential any more! The fears, tears and loneliness have served their purpose, or we would not be seeking the Path. We are now ready to go beyond sorrow. This is the Fool; this is the superconscious direction. This is the recognition of that level of our being which knows our destiny, has planned our destiny, just as we plan the education of our children. The Fool in us teaches us to be gay and debonair. We must learn how to invoke that level of our being, so that no matter what chasm seems to yawn at our feet, we can tread the brink without dismay. The proper use of Tarot Key No. 0 can help us to respond to life with poise and security. Almost always our real problem is the feeling of insecurity. This unnecessary negative state can be overcome with the proper techniques. But yqu will have to do it. We will he able only to show you the wa;r\" Why do we stress this point as so important a preliminary to developing the psychic faculties and learning how to understand them? For this reason: whatever emotional or mental state it is that you hold basically is that state of consciousness that you are going to tune into when you start developing or increasing your psychism, and we want to feel certain that you do not tune into levels of sorrow, loneliness or fear. We want you to start climbing toward and attaining to your divine heritage. Besides, if you suffer, we suffer, because no one suffers alone. With us this is not theorybut direct knowledge. If you are tuned into worry and soruow, it is our sorrow. You weep, we weep. All true aspirants know the unity of consciousness. This is why those who have gone on before seek to help lift the sorrow of the world. We realize that in order to rise above any particular experience, we must do as Jesus said, \"I, if I be lifted up, shall take all others unto myself.\" This is what all of us must do. We must learn how to feel security in knowing that we are not what we seem to be. We must learn how to hold the feeling of gaiety in the face of an environment which does not help to promote it. We must learn how to hold our attitude, our consciousness, on a level of love, even when we think that there is nothing to love. That seems rather hard, doesn't it? Yet remember, everything that we experience, we experience because we are it in some part of our being. All psychic faculties are a matter of tuning in to the mass mind and the substance of the mass mind, the substance of all things that are created. Therefore, we must, as we develop our extra-sensitivity to the subtle levels, be able to bring the higher down into the lower, rather than help to intensify the lower, which"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 11 increases the pain or the sorrow and hatred of all mankind. This is our first protection, and protection we need if we are going to be dealing with psychic faculties, as we explained to you. We are sure you have had the experience of being in the presence of someone who was in a fury, and have you not felt it to be like an infection or virus that you might catch? We \"catch\" the states of others because, on the subconscious level, we are sending and receiving radio stations. We must begin by making up our minds that we are children of God and deserve to be happy, We must make up our minds to give up whatever martyr complex we might have had, whatever self-pity we have had, whatever reasons we have felt for not deserving happiness or love. It is just these feelings that make us act in such a way towards some people as to force them, on subconscious levels, to betray and hurt us. We must make up our minds that now we are going to reach toward the highest levels of which we are capable. We must rcalize that we deserve to share actively in the gaiety and security of the Fool, the superconscious self, or God, just as a child is deserving of the care it receives from it's parents, no matter how naughty it may have been. When we develop that attitude, we can become receptive to the inspiration of the higher awareness. How does this method work? The ability to open up the channels represented by the Tarot keys works somewhat in this manner: We are basically symbol-manipulating creatures. AII human beings, regardless of where they live, dream in the same s5,'rnbols. Syrnbols reach into the deep sub-levels of our being as nothing else can. It was the wise men and the adepts of old who gave us the Tarot keys, each key embodying and symbolizing a particular principle and force. Each of these Tarot keys is a focal point for a specialized state of consciousness. Thus, as we tune into a force by learning how to use the Tarot key related to that force, we develop the correlated psychic faculty, safely and sanely. The powers of the symbol, the powers of Tarot, have been acknowledged by many schools of psycholory, including that of Carl Jung. Judge Troward stated that he considered Tarot the most potent method of uncovering the inner powers and learning how to use them. Ouspensky said much the same thing. Tarot is not a mild tool. As a matter of fact, it is the most potent, as well as the most effective means for esoteric teaching and training that exists on this planet. It is because Tarot has such power that we have to be very certain that you understand the importance of working with the psychological aspects of it, along with the psychic aspects. You must work with the mental and emotional principles of each of the Tarot keys for transmutation of your personality, while you are also using Tarot to stimulate supersensory perception. The first technique we wish you to employ is a very simple one, aimed at helping you to train yourself into the state of superconscious gaiety, no matter what events are occurring. This method must be practiced regularly, for the spiritual muscles have to be exercised just as religiously as your physical ones. The technique should be used every day, and many times a day, if you are able. The visualization technique of Tarot Key 0, The Fool, which you will find at the end of this lesson, is aimed at helping you to attune yourself to the superconscious level of the Inner School. Many of you will start sensing a glow of power at oncel others will take longer to become conscious of it; everyone varies."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 11 You will be making an announcement to the subconscious mind that superconsciousness is in charge of you. We are giving you this technique in order to help you lift yourself away from the hatreds and the insecurity of life. Therefore, before you use the further techniques that will be given you in the later lessons, we ask you to use this exercise as a preliminary practice, in order to set yourself on levels above pain, hatred and insecurity. This practice will help you to train your whole consciousness to tune into the upper level of awareness instead of being trapped by the negative vibrations which permeate the lower planes contiguous to the earth. In later lessons we will help you to understand and use various supersensory powers, which include clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, etc. Meanwhile, use this first technique to rise above depressions or frustrations. Say to yourself in essence what we indicate, but frame your affirmations in your own words. Use your own creative powers to make it living for you. EXERCISE FOR TAROT KEY O. THE FOOL Seat yourself comfortably in a chair that will hold your back upright. Place Tarot Key 0, The Fool, in front of you. Look at it quietly for flrve minutes, meanwhile breathing deeply and rhythmically. Close your eyes and continue your deep rhythmic breathing to the end of the practice. See yourself as being immersed in a pale yellow light, permeating every atom of your body, radiating out to approximately two feet from your body in every direction. This visualization should take the form of an oval. While holding yourself immersed in the pale yellow light, picture Tarot Key 0 as being above you in full three-dimensional imagery. Mentally draw the Fool downward into your oval of light. Now see yourself as being the Tarot key in all its details, including the colors. Try to experience yourself as a three dimensional representation of The Fool. Mentally enter into the position of the Fool, standing up straight, holding your memory on the staff in a debonair, light manner, full of the joy of the heights already attained. Now look up and out with a sense of wonder and adventure towards the next height to be scaled. Feel the jaunty feather on your head, experience the glow of the white sun energizing you. Be aware of your cloak of experience symbolizing the riches you carry with you from yesterday into tomomow. Fleach for the joyous expectation of wondrous experience to come. AFFIRMATION: \"I am the adventure of life. I am eternal youth. I have come from the previous valleys of yesterday to the invigorating heights of today. I am the eternal traveler, journeying into the miracle of self-discovery. I climb gaily from height to height. Never a time I was notl never a time I will not be. I am sure of foot, adventuring with laughter. I am the flame of livingness; the security of attainment is my destiny.\""}]
