[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POUTERS LESSON 3 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures Consciousness eternally creates; it can do nothing else. It is not that we learn how to create with our consciousness, but that, as aspects of God, we are the way in which God creates specific conditions or environment through the level of our thinking and feeling now. That is why, at the beginning of this course, we called your attention to Tarot Key 1, The Magician. This Key has to do with concentration on the here and now. If you wish tomorrow to be different from today, you must change what you think and feel today, no matter what the conditions of today appear to be. If you keep your mind and heart on the sorrow ofyesterday, ifyour thoughts and feelings center on past hurts and betrayals, the act of holding these thoughts in your consciousness will cause them to be recreated in your tomorrow. We cannot avoid creating; because we have consciousness, we cannot avoid creation. We may attempt to keep ourselves devoid of all feeling and thought. We have known some who tried this. They almost perished of boredom. There is nothing worse than boredom; it is much better to have problems, even great ones, to beat your breast and tear your hair and weep, than to live in an empty nothingness. Since we do have ever-creating consciousness, we actually want to learn to intensify this ability. To evolve it into a potent and directed force, so that we become conscious co-creators with the Universal Life instead of unconscious creators. That is why we say to you what all of the true mystery schools of the east and west have taught in their secret doctrine, that it is a great mistake to try to kill out desire, to try to tell yourself that you have no desire, to try to cease to create. In trying to keep the mind and heart a blank, devoid of thought and feeling, one builds a boredom, a desperation, because we cannot stop being alive. Whatever is, is. Whatever consciousness does experience, it experiences. If we wish to attain to anything worthwhile by our own efforts instead of waiting for the slow but certain evolution of the world, we must begin to seek to cooperate with evolution, and thereby accelerate world evolution for ourselves and for all creation. I hope that you have long since been wearied of traveling in circles, that you are ready to travel in an upward spiral, to attain to the worthwhile Now instead of in some distant incarnation to come. You can begin to do this nowl and now is always the only time in which you can begin. If you put it off until tomorrow, you are using your now to say \"tomorrow\" and then tomorrow will then be another \"today,\" for this is whatyou will have built with consciousness. Consciousness must always be pushing toward the next moment. It cannot help itself because this is the way in which God lives Its centers of expression. As we learn to recognize what our desires really are and how to feed them, as we learn to interpret and direct these desires in constructive ways, we shall cease to build more frustration and failure for ourselves. We all have built these unhappy structures, and none of us need be ashamed of our past mistakes, but we must now recognize what we have done. To those who are afraid to have desire, we can only say that, as you cannot help having desire, you must stop being afraid of it. God made you that way. Can you help wanting to have others like you? Can you help wanting to be kind to those whom you love? Can you help wanting to eat when you are hungry? Can you help wanting to sleep when you are weary? Can you help wanting to breathe? You cannot help these things. You will"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 3 always desire something, so you might as well stop desiring unconsciously and seek to fulfill your desires in accordance with Divine Pattern. Although the Eastern Tradition teaches that desire must be overcome, there is a little understood paradox involved in this overcoming. You cannot overcome desire until and unless you have fulfillment! This is one of the deepest and most profound esoteric secrets, and it is little understood. The way in which you overcome immature desire is to recognize that you have been choosing immature ways of fulfilling these desires. Those who have studied modern psycholory know that some of the gravest illnesses of the mind occur when people are so ashamed of certain desires that they have buried them down deep in the subconscious where these suppressed cravings have manufactured a host of demons. By attempting to stifle desire, such people have made themselves so mentally and emotionally ill that they are destructive not only to themselves but also to all those around them. When we say that the only way to overcome desire is to fulfill it, we do not mean that you should fulfill it in ways that are unsocial. He who is truly ready to travel the spiritual path of return will not seek to fulfill any desire in such a way that it will injure another human being. Indeed, any intelligent person who knows the bare rudiments of occult power will not do anybhing so foolish, because he will realize that if he seeks to fulfill a desire by injuring or destroying some other human being or by forcing himself upon another, his own creative consciousness will produce the exact experience for himself, because this is what his consciousness is building. Karma, in a sense, is only the Golden Rule. But it is not only \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\" but rather, \"Do unto others as they would like to have you do unto them,\" which is the more advanced form of the Golden Rule. You have to develop a genuine love of humanity to be able to do unto others as they would have you do unto them, rather than merely as you yourself would like to do. We have all felt at one time or another that if only people would do as we would like them to, they would be much better off, When they do not behave as we wish, we know that they are stupid, otherwise they would quickly see that our way is certainly the better way. This is a common failing we all possess, but the important thing to remember is that our own desires are the only things that we ourselves can come to understand and direct. In order to know that which we really desire and to be able to plan a social, spiritual, beautiful, intelligent way to fulfill the desire and to bring this desire into realit5r, the first thing for us to do is to recognize that if our desire has to do with changing someone else, we must stop cold. He who seeks to reform the whole world or just another human being faces a long struggle. In the end, not only will he find the results counter to his desire, but he will have produced more trouble in the meanwhile than he knows what to do with. You cannot change another human being; this is the first thing that you must realize! If your husband or your wife or parents or children are gteat problems, if they have much growing yet ahead of them, and if they need great transmutations, leave them in the hands of God. Each human being is in the hands of his own soul, and there is only one place from which you can work--and that is within yourself. If your desire requires changing another person--stop! One does not travel the occult path of return to develop his own powers over"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 3 others. The Path is not an escape or a means for personal power. We change others only as we transmute our own personalities. We hope that you will avoid the pitfall that traps many aspirants. They say, \"I want my son to go to college instead of taking that job,\" or \"I want my husband to stay home at night instead of playing poker.\" Such desires can effect nothing within your own nature. Until we understand our own desires, we are not in a position to transmute the old habit patterns and bring ourselves to spiritual illumination. It is necessary to decide what we desire and work at it for many reasons. To prepare for spiritual work you must exercise the muscles of consciousness. You must discover what it is that you do with your emotions. You cannot recognize and study what you are doing with your emotions unless you set yourself a goal and begin to watch what it is that you are doing to reach that goal. For instance, suppose I should decide that my goal is health and begin to watch myself in terms of this goal. We all desire to be healthy, but often we do nothing to achieve that goal. If I say that I wish to be healthy and yet if I deliberately miss the means of attaining that desire, if I deliberately eat foods that are not healthful, and if I deliberately omit taking proper exercise or seeing that I get enough fresh air, I may think that I desire health but if I study myself I will see that I am not doing the things that lead to fulfillment in this desire. I am, in fact, beingjust as aimless with my desire or goal as the person who says that all that he wants is spiritual development. As a matter of fact, a person who wants spiritual development has to express spiritualiQr in and through his form. If he is going to express spirituality in and through his form, then there are certain qualities the personality must develop. If his personality is to express certain qualities, these qualities need a framework in and through which to express themselves. If you desire spirituality, you will not develop it if you do not examine what you are doing with your relationships with others, what you are doing with your work, what you are doing with your emotions. If you think and feel that your neighbor is contemptible and then say that you desire spirituality, you are seeking escape from responsibility in the matter, using the desire for spirituality as an escape mechanism to avoid training your consciousness. Consciousness can be trained only as we become aware of what we are doing with it! We can become aware of what we are doing with our consciousness only as we set ourselves definite goals that give us specific aims. . . give this force a particular action. Hence, it is better to say, \"I want a dress,\" than to say \"I want nothingbut spirituality.\" If you say that you want nothing, you will have nothing, in time you will lose that which you do have. This is not an effective way to become spiritual. A person who seeks to be spiritual should want to be in a position from which he can express spiritual joy, spiritual glory, fulfillment. Some say they want love, their greatest desire is for love, and of course everyone's greatest desire is for love. In a way this is the most honest desire that anyone could state, except that most of us do not know what we mean by love. One student of ours said that she wanted a husband but found herself pursued by other women's husbands. In having this experience, she"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 3 discovered that the mind and the heart have to be much more explicit and exact in their desire. You must learn how to build the details of what you want. Another felt that all of his problems would be solved by money. He worked at picturing money. He was very good at visualization, and he pictured himself as handling great sums of money. In the end he found himself a bank teller, handling thousands of dollars--for someone else. It is important to learn how to study what our emotions do and how they act. We discover this only as we work with goals. Choose any goal that you please but work at it. You will find that those goals which are not important after all will drop away like an unfolding flower as the love of toys drops away from the child when it reaches adulthood. The nonessentials of life will drop away, and only that which is important, that which truly expresses the joy and glory of life will remain. This is what the One Life wants us to have. Some seem to feel that it is not spiritual to want personal fulfillment, but think for a moment. They say that all the world loves a lover. When people in love are in your presence, do you not find that they radiate something very lovely for you? And yet they are in the state of personal fulfillment, If you are personally fulfilled, you radiate out into life somethingjoyous, happy and beautiful. This is not undesirable. On the contrary, what we owe to the One Life, what we owe to the Lord of the Universe, what we owe to our fellow man, what we owe to everything that lives, what we owe to ourselves, is to work at our own self-fulfillment so that we too will broadcast from our subconscious levels beauty and happiness and love and unity in order to help lift others. \"And I, if I be lifted up, shall take all others unto myself.\" We repeat, it is not unspiritr.lal to want self-fulfillment. We make a great misfake in thinking that it is not spiritual to work, to love, to possess adequate finances, or to have a fruitful occupation through which to express our qualities. Could it not be that we have been failing miserably because we have not loved ourselves enough? He who truly loves humanity begins at the only place where he can be effective, and that can be only with himself. He develops within himself the capacity for value, for joy, for beauty and securit;i in order to be able to lift some of the soruow from the mass mind---within which we all dwell. We are not separate creatures. If you are miserable, you broadcast misery to others, most strongly to those in closest contact with you, but all, even to the most distant star, are saddened by your sorrow. Modern science has shown that even an electron in a sense is infinite. When we think, we are acting like a radio transmitter. Everything that we think or feel we broadcast throughout the universe. The effect of a thought is therefore not just felt on this planet; we effect everything with our thoughts and emotions. Wherever the consciousness can reach in imagination, that we affect. This is how vast we are! Strive to develop illumined selfishness, because illumined selfishness is not personal selfishness. We know that in lifting ourselves, in developing fulflrllment for ourselves, in developing the ability to smile, to sing, to love, to dance, through our own fulfillment, we are helping God's most potent desire and intentionl we are then truly fulfilling the Divine Plan, Now you see perhaps the most potent reason for discovering what you want."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 3 We have warned you that you must make sure from the first that you are not employing your desire nature to attempt to change someone else. Each of us has his own field to hoe and mow, his own weeds to pull, his own flowers to grow, You cannot cultivate another's garden. God shares with each of us a part of His garden and a part of His talent for our cultivation. We help the gardens of others by keeping the weeds out of our own. If you wish to help humanity, help yourself. If you want love, learn to love humanity enough to feel that, since the One Life, the Lord of Life wishes to express fulfillment through you, He is evolving you as His center for this express purpose; so learning to work consciously in cooperation with Him is perhaps the most spiritual thing that you can do. This is the Way toward true and complete illumination, mastery and adepthood. Most of us have sought it by the wrong way. The right way - and I hope that you will try it - is to start with your own heart and mind. The next thing, after making up your mind not to tend someone else's garden, is to try, when you are more or less with yourself, to analyze what it is on which your attention and yearning centers, This will give you a hint of what you really want, even though you may not clearly recognize it. It is better to risk occasional disappointment and so learn the working and control of mind and heart, than to continually delude ourselves and thereby deny ourselves the opportunity to work and master the universal forces in ever greater measute. It is our destiny, and it is our obligation to Life and to God to work towards this control, this mastery. 5"}]
