[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSBNSORY POWERS Lesson 18 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In this and the next lesson, we shall be working with The Emperor, Tarot Key 4. In the last lesson we took up The Empress, who is the wife of The Emperor, and as you will recall we emphasized the maternal aspect of the Empress, although there are many other elements involved in that key. Yet, the maternal principle of God is one of the most important things for us to understand and to work with in order to free our subconscious minds of the erroneous ways of thinking and feeling that we have developed regarding ourselves. Similarly, in discussing the Emperor, we shall emphasize Vision. As you will remember from earlier lessons, the concept of sight is particularly assigned to this Tarot key, number four. The Emperor is attributed to Aries, the first sign of the Zodiac, and there are several subtle indications of this in the key. The ram's head, for instance, stands for Aries, the Ram, and the astrological sign for Aries is on the top of the Emperor's crown. As known in astrologr, the head is associated with Aries and in particular the eyes, so that the idea of seeing is symbolically depicted on this key in several ways. Notice the position of the Emperor; he is looking out upon a stream. The stream that he is watching begins with the High Priestess, from whose robe it flows and continues through the Empress, where it makes her garden fertile. The Emperor, the ruler, the king, would have nothing to rule had not the fertility of the Empress brought forth children. The Empress' fertility is what makes him the ruler. The relationship of Key 4 to Key 3 has meanings on many levels, and its significance on each must be fully understood. One important point to note about the attribution of the Emperor to the masculine principle and of the Empress to the feminine principle is that both are shown as being rulers. Esoterically, it is known that, in effect, the Empress is subject to the Emperor, to the king and ruler of the entire household. This relationship has, however, been ruinously misinterpreted by exoteric religion and by society at large. Those of us whose bodies are feminine must seek this particular principle out very carefully in order to see it with an unbiased eye. Of course, when we come to understand the actual powers that are involved in the male and female principles, it is easy to see that all of us have both aspects within us. Whether we be male or female, our reasoning capacities partake of the masculine principle and our emotional and imaginative capacities partake of the feminine principle. However, when we are incarnated in the physical vehicle, whether male or female, we have a set of polarities which can be normalized and integrated only if we rid our minds of the nonsense of the battle of the sexes. The all-too-common cry of \"Isn't that just like a woman!\" from men, and \"Isn't thatjust like a man!\" from women, intended to be completely damning and a final judgment, is a little foolish, since in essence either can reflect both aspects. In practice we must recognize that on the outer plane, whichever physical vehicle we wear has characteristics that behave in accordance with universal principles. Thus, on the outer plane, in physical sexual relations, the female is receptive, the male is projective. On"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 18 the inner plane, the female is projective and the male is receptive. If more men and women would recognize this interdependent relationship between the sexes, they would be much happier. For neither has lost rulership; both rule their own spheres; they are as king and queen. It is this relationship that, as every well-mated woman knows, makes it possible for her to lead her husband to do anything she wishes by working with the female principles of receptive thought. The same type of reciprocity is true of her husband if they are really willing to be what they are and to respond to the life processes in the way they should. But we cannot use these methods unless we are at peace with ourselves, and this is usually not the case. You must be at peace with your own subconscious mind before you will be able to establish a proper relationship with the opposite sex and with your own conscious mind as well. Indeed, if you do not have these facets of your own nature in balance, you will not be able to establish proper relationships anywhere. And when we say proper relationships, we do not necessarily mean maniage or even physical love, but friendships as well. Relationships take place in the first instance on mental and emotional levels. Just as physically the male causes the female to quicken with life, so on the inner plane it is the Empress who stirs the Emperor into activity. It is this interplay between the polarities within ourselves alone and with other people that makes for the greatest experiences of life and for a deeper understanding of life. The Emperor, the masculine principle in us, is assigned to the ability to reason. I know, of course, that many men feel that women lack this ability and many women feel that men lack it. Actually, each of us has a way of reasoning after his or her own fashion. As we become familiar with what takes place inside ourselves, we are able to handle relationships and establish the kind of environment that we want in every way. The Emperor aspect of ourselves must become the ruler, the king. All the keys are different aspects of the Fool. The Emperor is a phase of the Fool in its aspect of rulership; for when we consider that the reasoning concept is assigned to that in us which is the ruler, we realize that the ruler must be the Higher Self. What else could it be? And, knowing that the reasoning capacity is an expression of our Higher Self, we rcalize its importance in occultism. A great deal of nonsense is taught by self-styled students of metaphysics; they say such things as, \"Oh, I don't have to bother about thinking this through; I'll just let my intuition guide me.\" All you have to do in these cases is to look at the mess in which their intuition has landed them and you will see what kind of intuition is guiding them. Intuition cannot be your guide until you have first developed sufficient reasoning ability. That is why with the next Tarot key, the one after the Emperor, we shall take up intuition and show you what it is and is not. The ability to reason must p1gggfu reliance on intuition, as shown by the order of the Tarot keys. With the Fool, we were awakened to the sense of adventure, to the willingness to live; with Tarot Key 1, The Magician, to the necessity of alert attention in order to gather in reliable data; with the High Priestess, we were awakened to the process that absorbs this data and files it away in memory, along with all of the universal interpermeations that take place at that level. From the conjoining of the Magician and the High Priestess (indeed, one may say in a sense they are married and become the Emperor and Empress), from their"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 18 B relationship, you have creative imagination, the creative ability of the Empress. Once something is created you have the king who has to frame the law of action and relationship, This framing of the constitution, in a sense, takes place on all levels including the physicaf level. All principles are true on all levels when you learn to understand them. But we cannot have the material for correct reasoning unless we have gone through the previous steps symbolized by the preceding keys. What is it to reason correctly? It is to have the ability to evaluate your data and to look at what is really there, instead of what we want to see there. There must be no self deception. One of our greatest problems in life is that we do not see what is actually there. When people betray us, we are upset. Had we been able to see clearly and reason accurately, they would not have betrayed us. We would not have put ourselves in the position to be betrayed. we did not know how to look. Sight is the sensory function attributed to this key, which also has the faculty of reason. Sight and knowledge are closely connected in our speech. When we understand something, we often say, \"Oh yes, I see.\" In some languages, such as Greek and ancient Egrptian, the verb meaning \"to know\" is simply the past tense of the verb meaning \"to see.\" There is an inner seeing, an inner perception. Sight assumes knowledge of how to look. Our problem is that we usually do not know how to look, and hence do not see, We hide from our vision the very things that are obvious, the little traits and attitudes. We fail to study the stream of consciousness that flows through our own subjective lives. Since we have not really studied our own motivations, we fail to recognize the motivations and attitudes of other people. In this lx,'s)/, 14'e open ourselvcs to all kinds cf problerns .whicl:, little by little, teach us how to recognize motivations and to look beyond the surface appearances. If you consider vision, you will realize that all seeing is done by the consciousness, It is your consciousness that really sees; your eyes are only an instrument, a camera lens taking in impressions and vibrations. It is the consciousness that interprets what is taken in, Your consciousness will begin to interpret more and more correctly as you develop to a higher degree the willingness to look, to see, to accept reality. To do this, you must stop being afraid. That is why Key 4 shows a warrior king, full of courage. Aries is characterized by the courage of the executive. You must have the courage to be willing to see, in order to develop an objective view, In connection with sight, we shall also consider clairvoyance, which is a perception that sees beyond the surface, for there are different kinds and levels of seeing. A discussion of clairvoyance will help us understand how outer faculties can, when correctly used, gradually be developed into supersensory powers available at will, not merely flooding in haphazardly as is usually the case with psychics. Actually, people who are psychic ofien see visions which have no meaning at all, and just as often they try to read some meaning into them. An acquaintance of mine, who is psychic, seems to think that his psychic ability makes him very spiribual, yet this man is not \"here\" at all, If you remember what we said in our lesson on Key 1, The Magician, you will know exactly what I mean. I{e is not \"here,\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 18 never present. When you talk to him, he never hears what you say; the first thing he does is to go to sleep, he is that much not here! This particular psychic is not only clairvoyant but also clairaudient; he hears as well as sees all sorts of things. As far as his seeing them and hearing them goes, they are good. But he has no discrimination because he lacks true reasoning ability. He cannot truly evaluate what he receives because he is not all here. Those who have this kind of clairvoyance should bend all their efforts to develop critical reasoning powers. It is known that there are many, many varieties of vibrations that affect people who are psychic; even those who are not especially psychic will occasionally have an experience of clairvoyant vision that does not necessarily mean anything. For example, they might suddenly see a beautiful tree because of being in a certain attunement or vibration, or because of the planets being in a certain relationship, If they are a little withdrawn from the outer world, suddenly their astral being becomes focused without there being any more meaning in the experience than if they were taking a drive and saw a beautiful tree. For an instant they have a sight, a vision of almost anything: country, animal, star. This happens frequently, and having had such an experience, people often ask, \"What does it mean?\" They seem to think that what you experience must have a meaning. Perhaps you, too, have had some such experience. The thing to remember is that it does not necessarily have a particular meaning, any more than a special meaning is attached to the fact thatwhenyou drive where there are mountainsyou see the mountains. It is just a matter of taking in a certain observation; and observations can be taken in on the astral plane often and mistaken for physical ones. People do not always realize that they are sometimes seeing astrally. The kind of clear seeing that we want to develop, and will develop as we practice with the Tarot, is based on reasonable analysis. Those of you who have a psychic temperament will go through a certain stage in which visions will come for no reason at all, and there is nothing wrong with this so long as it does not enchant and preoccupy you to the extent of absorbing your attention on the question of what it means. It is much more constructive to keep your attention on the idea, \"God sees through my eyes.\" Thus you advance your own expansion of consciousness. We must use our reasoning and recognize that what we see astrally needs special evaluation. The chief problem in applying the Emperor to our own lives lies in being objective. We usually fail to be sufficiently objective because there are so many things that would frighten us if we saw them as they really are. Having set our hearts and minds on certain pictures of ourselves and others, we cannot bear, from within, to see reality. The truth is, paradoxically, that to the degree that you learn to look at people as they really are and conditioned as they are, to that degree will you stop having the pain of disillusion and disappointment. You will be then doing and reacting to things in a way to open yourself to a more consistent intuition, because you are taking in reality to the utmost of your ability. It is worth pointing out that babies have to learn how to seel they do not at first see what we see. When someone has been blind and suddenly, because of a medical or spiritual miracle, regains his sight, the reports are always that he does not know how to interpret what he sees. A globe and circle look the same to him. A person walking toward him"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORYPOWERS: 18 b appears to grow larger as he nears. The eyes of such a person pick up a certain image, but it is the consciousness that must interpret the electrical impulses transmitted from the eye to the brain. And yet, we fall into the error of saying \"seeing is believing. \" The outer seeing, the looking at appearances, is the gleatest of illusions if we accept it as the whole truth. We have to learn to look at things in a special way, which is the burden of this lesson, together with the insights and perceptions that develop from this type of learning, We will begin to recognize our own prejudices, and when we finally find them amusing, we may know that we are really succeeding in being objective. Do we love someone for a special qualify or do we love just because we love? That is the basic idea. When we are able to be objective, we are able to see true and develop relationships based on reality. Then we can not be disillusioned. You must practice objectivity, of course, and this can bring many unhappy experiences. I remember the first time I had an extraordinary perception beyond the range of clairvoyance while working with the Tarot. I had known someone for about two years whom I considered almost a Master of Wisdom; he was exceptionally developed, and he taught me many things. As this was before I came to Dr. Case and Builders of the Adytum, I thought that he was very highly evolved, Then certain things occuned which were not in keeping with this high estimate of his character. I '*'as cvetwhelmed and ccrnpleteiy ber',ildered. I felt tl-rat I should nevel. have expected this type of conduct from one who had shown me such other traits and powers. This discrepancy kept bothering me; my mind would dwell on it, trying to gain some understanding or insight into it. Curiously enough it was while I was working with the Emperor that my puzzle was solved. . . I was resting, and my mind was focused on this individual. Suddenly I saw him clairvoyantly in his office with two other people; I saw the position he sat in talking to the people in a business conference. The remarkable thing was that I did not only see him clairvoyantly; I saw into his soul. It is possible, then, to have many levels of experiences in seeing; clairvoyant seeing on the psychic level is in many ways not very different from seeing on the physical plane. The development of spiritual vision is something truly to be worked for and aspired to. (Incidentally, I checked, and he had been in his office with those two people, sitting on the corner of his desk, exactly as I had seen him. My psychic vision was valid.) This seeirtg into his soul is no physical seeing, nor is it a psychic seeing, it is a spiritual seeing, and this is the seeingthat is unbelievable until one has had this experience. It has in itself a knowingness of seeing with the Higher Self that is beyond question. I saw into his soul, not in form but in essence, and what I saw I can only attempt to describe. Although he was a highly evolved person in certain areas of his nature and personalitSr, there were three great undeveloped areas--empty, black, blind spots in his soul. Because the rest of him was so developed, the spots were the blacker and the more incredible. This was a spiritual seeing that I had in conjunction with psychic clairvoyant seeing, and let me recognize that those three big black spots were so serious that it would take him several incarnations to fill them with light, through experience.

It is like a grft from the Higher Self, a gift of perception that came when I achieved the ability to face reality. Concentrate, therefore, on all the myriad forms and conditions that surround you. Reach for the ability to see the infinite number of details that usually escape you. Thus will you prepare yourself for extending your range of vision and finally achieve the capacity to see on the highest levels of your being."}]
