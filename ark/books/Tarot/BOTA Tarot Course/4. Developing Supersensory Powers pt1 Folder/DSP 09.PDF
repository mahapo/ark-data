[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 9 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures Let us consider a few of the steps that we have taken in this series. We began by impressing upon you the importance of finding out what it is you want to be and to do, because without being, without doing, you go nowhere. It is vital to decide what you want. Following this, it becomes important to understand the wants and to work with every fiber of your being to bring about the fulfillment of these wants. If we do not do this, how can we learn to handle and manipulate the forces of the universe? God creates from the web of His own consciousness, and this is the theory of all occult and metaphysical teachings. It is no theory to those who have engaged in contemplation. People who have had even a flash know it well. Therefore, if the Lord of Life creates through the processes of His own mental substance, through thinking and imaging; if this is the way in which creation takes place, we as the sons and daughters of God, have the same potential, the same ability, in smaller measure, When a baby is born, it cannot in any way do the things that an adult human being does. In the same way, we must realize that when we say that we are the begotten sons and daughters of God, of the Cosmic Mother and Father, we are also the infants who have not yet become God-like in our ability but are so destined to become. Our security lies in the fact that we are children of God and partake of the consciousness of God. Therefore, no matter what happens, no matter how hellish the present seems or the past has been, the fact is that it is all part of the training process. ilow dcies a baby leani to waik? tsy brrrising ii,self all over. How cioes a baby iearn ro faik? By making an utter mess of the sounds. How does a baby learn to listen? By making absolutely no sense of the jumble of sounds until consciousness develops from the continuous impacts of certain vibratory experiences related to something that is occurring. How does a baby learn to see? One is not born able to see simply because one has a pair of eyes. Remember Key 15, The Devil, called the Eye. That key is assigned to the eye as an organ of vision. That is what the Hebrew letter, Ayin, assigned to it means, and that is the whole secret of development in evolution. Learning how to see is one of the secrets of the Great Work. An infant is born with a pair of eyes, but it has to learn to see. Human beings who have been born blind or became blind as infants are terrified at what happens if a miracle occurs and they begin to see. Their reports are significant and interesting. They cannot correctly interpret what they see. They have to learn how to see. It is significant that if we would learn how to understand what really occurs in the phenomenal universe, we should have a better understanding of the laws of consciousness in the psychic and spiritual fields, because \"as above so below; as without, so within.\" When we have not yet learned how to see, what we see looks like hell. We have not yet learned how to create properly, so we create grotesqueness, the miserable and unhappy experiences that we have. This is not evil but part of the growth process, of learning how to balance the vehicle, of how to control and direct it. The phenomenal universe and our experiences in it are no different from the baby learning to walk. The whole point is to know how to see and to analyze corectly, to learn what happens in our creative powers, in order to make better and better use of them!"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 9 When a child takes clay and begins to shape figures, its attempts are horrible. We do not think of them as horrible because we know that a child is doing it, but when we look at what humanity in general does, it appears appalling. Our consciousness builds our bodies and everything else we experience, and when it appears to us most unlovely it is because we have not yet learned how to build a lovely figure; or perhaps, having learned it we did not know how to revere it and therefore must learn how to take proper care of it and to revere it, to treat it with the respect that it deserves because it is the temple of God, whether we know it consciously or not. It is for this reason that it is so important to work with the laws of consciousness as taught in our courses, for only so will you have the help, the aids that are required in order to train the muscles of your consciousness to see what it is really doing and creating. Thus, you teach it how to see and how to observe true perspective. An eye has to have a good consciousness behind it to have true perspective. Perspective is the ability to weigh and measure accurately with the eye and the consciousness. In order to develop perspective, we need to learn how to see reality, how not to look merely at surfaces. When we look at surfaces only, we are seeing what they are not. We are then like the children who have not yet learned how to see or the people who, suddenly attaining sight, do not know how to interpret what they are seeing. Learning to interpret is part of the secret of the Great Work. One does not learn how to interpret until one has the courage to do so. The Hebrew letter assigned to Key 8, Teth, is attributed to the secret of all spiritual activities. We shall ana.lyze the ideas implicit in that coneept. We mnst have tJre e.ourage to go into life and decide what we want to be and do and to work towards it in the face of every obstacle. We must develop the interpretive ability so we may recognize unrealistic aims and make whatever changes are necessary, and to continue practicing on conscious creation in order to attain to our birthrights. Children would never learn to talk if we did not teach them. In the same way, we should never learn how to use spiritual powers that are basically ours if God did not teach us. God teaches us through a hierarchy, through a descending scale of transmitters. This is the grace of God, that along with learning to interpret experiences correctly you must also learn how to discriminate between the true teacher and the slanderer, the falsifier, the Devil. If we wish and try, we shall learn this more rapidly, less painfully, and be able to get on with the job. The rewards, the precious fruits that we receive, are almost incomprehensible. They are like the rewards of the dancer, who after practicing grueling exercises, is able to float like a bird in air rhythmically and to music. The more sensitive your taste is, the more you enjoy food; the more acute your hearing is, the more song you hear and the more glorious is the song of life. Many people do not hear the subtle sounds of nature. One must learn how to listen. That to which you give your attention is that which develops! Therefore, those who develop the ability to create consciously-as we all must sooner or later in accordance with the universal law of creation-play an ever increasing role. ThouEht is creation. A builder does not build a house only with mortar and sand and plaster and wood. These are part of the means toward the final structure. Someone had to imagine the house. That was the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 9 first step, In the physical universe and on the physical plane, it is consciousness that creates! The process is so slowed down that we become centered in the appearance and think that it is material things that built the house. No amount of material things can build a house without a consciousness to create it and organize and plan it, and willing hands and heart together to fulfill the structural dream. Remember that there is only one dream and One Dreamer, That one dream and One Dreamer are not separate from us, We are each a cell in the brain of the Dreamer. We are each an aspect of consciousness in the total consciousness of God. We are nothing separate; we are nothing apart. Whatever it is that we as individual centers create, it is nothing separate from the total Universal Creative Urge. It abides in it and comes from it and is eternally with it and includes all situations. To the problem of good and evil we return the answer, \"There is no such thing as good or evil.\" They are the way in which we interpret the magnificent and glorious cosmic process. That which has brought us pain in the final analysis is that which has developed more strength, more spiritual progress, knowledge, insight, the ability to create more effectively. It is the training ground. Whatever is in pain or hurt is nothing separate from God; it is a cell of God, a part of God, God's own cell structure exercising and developing and moving parts of Itself for destined fulfillment, Whatever we decide to bring about as fulfillment of our consciousness is not made spiritual or unspiritual by its nature but by what we feel about it in our minds and hearts! If \"re feel God acting, feeling, experiencing and devclcping abilities thrcugh us, ',r'hat r','c want is spiritual even if it is a highly tangible object. If we think ourselves so highly evolved that we have no use for physical things, if we wish only to meditate, to try to achieve conscious union with God, our motive being the need to feel spiritually superior to lesser evolved souls, we achieve nothing. No one is spiritual simply because he thinks he is trying to use his creative process on meditation concerning union with God. Who in that case would do the work of the world? How is such an aspirant to learn to be a co-creator, to attain the heritage of that which is and belongs to him as a son of God? Qabalah teaches that materialism is largely nonsense, and its pseudo-spiritualism equally nonsensical. Those who say, \"Away with the world; I am through with it. I do not need it any more; I shall live in a hermitage,\" are no more spiritual than those who are rankly materialistic. One seeks to escape as much as the other, and each will have to learn better. He who despises his body does not revere and work properly with the physical factors that we are here to work with. He is creating karma from which an incarnation of sadness will teach him to revere and love and take care of his magical instrument, the body and the physical environment. It is only in and through the amazing structure of the human vehicle that God can experience the universe in a specialized way, can experience relationships in a specialized way. Only when this entire development is perfected completely can one even begin to think that perhaps there is another stage in which one might not require this type of vehicle."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWER,S: 9 Learn to become that which you are destined to be. As aspirants you have extra responsibility. That responsibility is not only to yourself but to all. If you have enough intelligence to study the Tarot, you should be able to recognize and rcalize the vital importance of taking step after step along the path toward liberation, however you interpret it. Liberation is not what we think, Tarot Key L2, The Hanged Man, is liberation. It is your responsibility to yourselves and to humanity and to life in general to attain to enough conscious creative ability to help change the damnable situation on this planet. It arises because we are all too young. The way in which we grow is not quite the way in which the infant grows. It is analogous but unlike the infant. We must take ourselves in hand, with the Higher Self impelling and pulling. Each of us is responsible for war, hatred, and bloodshed to the degree that we contribute to it in irritations, condemnations, dislikes and weaknesses that make us mentally lazy. There is no such thing as the royal road to grace. The easiest way is that to which we direct you, because it is definite and steady. Be the turtle rather than the hare. Keep plugging; let nothing interfere. Do not be lured away by nonsense. The difference between a psychotic and a neurotic is that the psychotic knows that two and two make five and is very happy about it, and the neurotic knows that two and two make four and is miserable about it. That, unfortunately, is the way we are a good part of the time. Either we think that two and two make five and we are wrong, or we know that it makes four but do not care for the idea- Two and twornaking four have not enor-rgh glamour or we do not realize how glamorous it really is. We do not realize how amazing and miraculous it is to be able to breathe, to feel, to touch, to smell, to think, to weep, to laugh. That should be miracle enough for anyone. In Tarot Key 8, Strength, you see the actual process, the function involved in transmutingyour subconscious, in learning how to control and direct the libido. The libido is the sex drive with its patterns and conditionings, and involves with it the whole subconscious field. This Tarot Key shows you how to control and direct the libido. It is done through love. Red roses sJrmbolize desire and love. You remember from your lessons that the Magician, Key 1, represents a cause that is put into effect through the medium of Key 8 and results in a condition exemplified by Key 15, the Devil. The horizontal 8 above the head of the woman in Key 8 shows you that Key 1 is the power or principle behind Key 8. Key 8 itself is the agency or law governing that principle. The Tarot keys are like words that must be strung into phrases or sentences. Tarot and Qabalah are the universal language, the language of symbol which speaks to the part of you that knows it even when you have not been trained consciously. We are training you consciously because you must become a conscious co-creator with God. Key I involves the attention of the Magician; we put our attention to work on the libido, the lion, the vital soul of subconsciousness. This brings about the results seen in Key 15 which has some positive and negative aspects, depending on the degree of spiritual maturity or immaturity."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 9 The highly evolved mature soul develops ever more laughter, a sense of the ludicrous, the ability to differentiate between appearance and the deeper aspects, The immature human soul judges by appearance, is bound and chained in a world of darkness and cannot respond properly to the sun in the sky, the twinkling star, or the light that comes from human eyes. Laughter is the flrrst motion of the cosmic process, an experience that develops spiritual muscles. Here in Key 8 you see continuous self-conscious attention trained upon the animal soul. The creative part of self-consciousness is indicated by the woman and means that subconsciousness has here become a conscious thing. If you think that it cannot, you are mistaken. We can become aware of our subeonscious workings, and in time we will all be aware. You become aware of these subtleties playing in and out of your nature, coming from the subconscious aspects of yourself. Subconsciousness is that part of the consciousness that can send the release of enerry into our life! The way in which the enerry is released depends on what we are seeing and how we are interpreting it, what patterns are held by our attention! Focus the attention on the world as a hell, and to you it will be hell. One cannot avoid seeing that certain aspects of life are painful, but that does not mean that one should see all of it that way. One should not react emotionally to an appearance and consider that that is all there is. The shadow of the Lord is not what it appears. We must take in hand the libido drive, the subconsciousness, the fierce lion that abides in our hearts and souls. Tarot helps us to train ourselves to do so, but it requires a regular and self-conscious effort, One cannot sit down for fifteen minutes a day to meditate and think that one has done al!, One must bring Tarct into the ever)'da5,.life. One must practice living the Tarot. Otherwise subconsciousness cannot transmute the raging lion. Principles must be lived. A beautiful intellectual exercise cannotdo a practical job unless its principles are incorporated into our daily living. Practice the principles of the Tarot every single moment of the day. As you practice with the techniques that we will give you in the following lessons in this course, they will become a background. Tarot will become the living essence in your life, making everyday and week and month something exciting. You will not have to seek artificial magic and miracles that amaze, You will have them every day in your own life in the places in which you need to discover them. That is how transmutation takes place effectively. The raging lion within us, the automatic vital soul, is the raw and conscious eners/ of the universal life and is a frightening thing. But we, as human evolving souls, must take the raw, undifferentiated, wild, free enerS/ that is symbolized as the lion, the energr that wells up within us to love and hate, to fear and be courageous depending upon how we have trained him, and utilize it consciously. It is like training an animal to become human. This is the way in which human consciousness is utilized by God to transmute the undifferentiated, unconscious substance of Its own beingness. We must do it in the same way. That is part of the reason that we have so many problems. In attempting to control the raw substance of life, we are learning how to swim against the tide. We can do it. We can become strong swimmers and arrive in still waters where we can float. First, we have to learn how to swim, because from time to time we shall have to do some swimming."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 9 To control that energr, start by utilizing the combination of discrimination and love. Remember Tarot Key 8 on the Tree of Life, connects Chesed to Geburah. It is one of the cross paths between the spheres of activities on opposite poles of the One Life. It is by training our libido subconscious eners/ drive in specific ways as you \\Mere taught in your lessons that we learn how to balance mercy and severity. Severity is also volition and drive. In a negative sense it is fear. Through that process we learn what true mercy is. We learn that sometimes loving requires a stick in the hand. Weak blandishment is not true loving, though it may give the appearance of such. True love will not let the child run out into dangerous traffic no matter how much the child storms to run. True love can use discipline when needed, because it does so with good will and love. We must have the same feeling and realization about our own raw eners/ drives when we are aroused by irritation, hatreds and remorse. We all have these at times, and if we are afraid to admit them, how can we transmute them? Suppressed rage is liable to break out in unconscious cruelty and/or alcoholism. We are liable to murder others deliberately with our tongue over actions that pretend to be kind but are aimed at tearing apart another soul. Have you ever caught yourself at this, or at least caught others at it, making believe there are halos around our heads in order to make another uncomfortable? We have a tendencyto call our own motives beautiful and castigate those of the other person, We must learn to chuckle at ourselves. The more we learn to chuckle at ourselves, the more perspective we will have, the easier it will be to train and transmute. Transmutation becomes simple when we have humor, because we do not feel the need to mourn in sackcloth and ashes, because we realize that although we thought we had a loving nature, subconsciously we have been hating, perhaps unconsciously wishing to kill. Hate and love are ambivalent. Hate moves in action, and we must recognize that and do something about it. We cannot recognize it if we go into sackcloth and ashes full of self-reproach and say, \"God help me.\" Many enjoy this, but it would be better if they went to the motion pictures or watched television rather than waste their energr in their own destructive dramatizations. This is an aspect of an over-inflated little ego. But we do not need ego; we are the begotten sons and daughters of God. We are so vitally important that we do not need to feel important in worldly ways. There was no time when we were not. We are the way in which God experiences an aspect of Its beingness. We are the way in which God creates specialized self experiences, and an expansion of self-conscious diiection. We have no need to be more spiritual than someone else or more kindly or more anything. What we need is to know reality. What we need is to know the truth about the Self. We will learn to live this as we learn to recognize the little elements in ourselves that are wrong and utilize the Tarot keys to transmute them from one expression to another. This makes us more adult, spiritually speaking. The Inner School has told us repeatedly that it is vital at this time to lead as many aspirants as possible through the division that is taking place now in the evolution of the human soul on this planet, An influx into incarnation of souls from previous evolutions as well as souls flocking in from our own evolution is coming to be given another chance. We will either be the laggards and stay behind, as many will, or we will be those who cross the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 9 barrier. Remember that each who develops more spiritual intensity and insight is radiating a power and a strength that helps others, so that it is not only for ourselves that we must work, but for all of those who can attune to us. This is a very important time in the spiritual evolution of life. Yours is the privilege of being able to gather together in this intensive esoteric work and training. Never before in the history of occult training has so much been given to those who are prepared without the physical supervision of a personal teacher. As you progress through the techniques that we shall give you to use with the 22 m4jor trumps of the Tarot to develop extrasensory perception and power, apply yourself carefully and in a dedicated manner, remembering the responsibilities that lie upon you. You will enjoy it; it is fun!"}]
