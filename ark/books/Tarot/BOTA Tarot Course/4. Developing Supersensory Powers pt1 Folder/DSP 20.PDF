[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS Lesson 20 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In this lesson we deal with The Hierophant, Tarot Key No. 5, which sSrmbolizes intuition. Intuition is a very much misunderstood faculty, even though people speak of it often. This is because we have a tendency to call intuition all ideas that we receive from other than the five outer senses. In one way this is correct, but it is not what is meant by the Higher Inner Intuition. We shall show the differences between the various levels of reception and give you a technique to help develop true intuition. In the Hierophant, or \"Ihvealer of the Mysteries,,' the main figure is one depicted in the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries and in the mysteries of the Essenes as well. Whatever words we use to describe The Hierophant as we translate from language to language, we always keep this same symbol to reflect the same basic teaching and training. The Hierophant symbolizes the interior teacher, the \"Revealer of the Mysteries.\" Some people react a little adversely to this Tarot Key, mistakenly attributing the main figure to a religion with which they disagree. This is unfortunate. You must iearn to reject all of your conditioned reactions to orthodox religions or the symbols you associate with them in the same way that you reject conditioned reactions to race, color or creed. All religions have taken their symbolic figures from the universal storehouse of true symbolism, and whether they have ultimately misused them or not, whether their interpretations have beccrne too literal or nct, is not our ccncern. It is cur business to rvalk the path of enlightenment, expanding our consciousness, developing our supersensory powers and perceptions, and letting others go whatever way they must at this time in their incarnational evolution. Be careful not to let biases develop in your consciousness just because other schools of thought and religion use the same or similar symbols and principles. This must inevitably be so, since all religions, when they first began, had their origin in some true principle, no matter what form of absurdity or literality they finally may have developed. We must rcalize that human consciousness, in its infantile state, takes a true teaching and, in time, makes of it something almost unrecognizable. Consider what Jesus taught. Can we assign His teachings to the spirit of the Crusades? Young Christian adherents marched off to see how many infidels they could kill for Jesus. This is not what Jesus intended' These immature beings misinterpreted, abused and revised His teachings. Let us keep symbol and principle pure, so that we can use them for the evolution of our own consciousness and avoid being mired in the mass mind interpretation. Without the proper use of symbols (and this is a strong statement, but it is true), you cannot obtain to the mastery and expansion of your consciousness and power! Whenever the aspirant reaches a point at which he is ready for the more complete teachings and training, he is guided to the place where this teaching is available. We have often referred to elementary metaphysics, and we think very highly of it for beginners, but to stay in the first grade ali of your life is not growth. The reason we must recognize the vital importance of symbols is that our consciousness has been conditioned through many incarnations. The impact of the mass"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 20 mind which we share with all humanity influences our reactions to words and to language. This conditioning may or may not coincide with actual occurrences in consciousness. A word is really the description of a symbol or picture in your consciousness. When we communicate with words, we are linked by these words, but we are also plagued by misunderstandings that arise from the fact that no word ever quite means the same to two different people. Tarot Key No. 5 is assigned to the faculty of hearing, both outer hearing and inner hearing. To receive the teachings that come only through interior hearing, we must understand the principles of consciousness and the principles of communication. The different levels and aspects of consciousness have their symbols. The Tarot Keys are pictorial representations of consciousness and the powers of consciousness, therefore, the most direct way to develop higher levels of awareness is to learn these symbols consciously. Subconsciousness already knows them. Modern psychological research has shown that all human beings, no matter where they live, from the most primitive to the most scholarly, dream in the same symbols. Certain symbols are universal; Jung calls them parts of the collective unconscious of mankind. In learning how to gain control of the various aspects of consciousness, we use the corresponding universal symbols. Tarot embodies all the universal symbols and relates them to specific aspects of consciousness. Tarot teaches us about consciousness in the language of symbols. As advanced students, all of you have learned that mere affirmations will not take you to your chosen goals. Words can never bring us the attainment of any of the powers we want because, basically, words are an abstraction. Of course, we need words. When I speak to you in werds;I har-e'a picture in-rt5r;ai*d. My eenseie'.rsneffi ?ve&rres v*ords around this picture which are sent out as a series of sounds to be picked up by your ears. These sound vibrations register in your brain and the brain translates the sound into words. The words are re-assembled into an image in your mind. You can see how indirect our contact is with the use of words. In telepathy the contact from mind to mind is much more direct. With this faculty, images need not be translated, and thus the consciousness of two or more entities may tune into each other and become one for the time being. When we are in the physical body, we have to learn how to use words, and how to use them accurately. If we do not, our words will result in inaccurate images confusing to us and to others. When we function on the inner planes, or after we drop the physical body it is not through words that we communicate with each other. We communicate through direct thought. This could be very embarrassing because one cannot hide one's thoughts. However, it is the rule that after you drop the physical body, you function on a vibratory level with kindred souls who have thoughts and emotions similar to yours, The law of attraction automatically brings you to those who are similar to yourself. For this reason, it is very important to develop your consciousness now. Even if you do not aspire to becoming a completely illumined soul in this incarnation, even if you have not yet this supreme aspiration, it is very important to learn how to control your consciousness at will, so that you no longer fall into the unconscious habits of resentment, hate and criticism. This does not mean giving up evaluation and judgment; that is another matter entirely, as you will see."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 20 B Interior hearing is not the same thing as clairaudience, although many people confuse the psychic faculties of clairaudience with the reception of th; higher teaching from spiritual levels. There are differences. I mentioned the fact that our thoughts and oulr emotions are not private. This is true, although we are not consciously aware of the interpermeations that go on. You can become depressed or cheered by someone else,s thought forms or emotions because you were open to it at the time. We are like radio stations; we tune in to that which we are transmitting at the moment. That is why it is so important to evolve. The whole secret behind failures in elementary metaphysics is that they lack the techniques for evolving. Because we are radio statiorrr thut receive as well as broadcast, we tend to transmit in terms of what we receive. This same attraction of like-to-like is true on discarnate levels, and even on non-human levels; the forms of consciousness called elementals. Discarnate beings think and project just as much as incarnate beings. There is much less separation than we think. I will now explain some aspects of attraction to aid you in understanding the differences between communications from entities, either discarnate or incarnate, arid teachings from the higher spiritual levels. You must rcalize that we live in our astral bodies now. We live in our mental bodies now. We live in our spiritual bodies now. While incarnated, our attention or concentration is centered on what we call the physical universe. We are not consciously aware, unless we are psychic to some degree, of these other vehicles that form our being. When a person dies, h-e does nct g9, an;nx7lure, he merely vrithCrar','s tlie attention from that v.ibrational level we call the physical plane. At death, the attention is withdrawn, causing the elements that were attracted about the force field on the physical plane to dissolve. Tliat is why the physical body dissolves. The thinking entifr, that which kept it together, is now concentrated on the next finer vehicle in the astral plane. Therefoie, this entity continues to be in contact with incarlated beings because everyone has an astral body. people usually are unaware of their astral bodies because their consciousness is focused o.r th\" vibrational ]9ve!9f the physical plane, as it should be. It is very dangerous to work deliberately and blindly for astral consciousness. Tarot study brings about a gradual, safe, unfoldment, automatically stimulating the various psychic centers in a balanced way, while at the same time allowing the major iart of the attention to remain on the physical plane. You have many things to riaster. you have the job of learning to manipulate the physical universe. This need 6\" ,ro burden. To the degree that we learn how to handle life on the physical level properly, to that degree do we develop the strength of our own individuality and soul. This is wheie we do the real growing, the real evolving. The inner world assimilates the lessons of physieal life. We must never neglect the outer level; nevertheless, we must not think that tie outer levels are all important, or that all we are is body. We are not. As this realization develops, we open ourselves more and more to interior hearing, symbolized by the Hierophant, the true interior teacher. Because discarnate beings can contact any one of us who is even slightly telepathic (and most of us are much more than slightly telepathic), we receive the imfaci of thbughts from discarnate beings just as much as those of incarnate beings. To use again the anilog, of the radio set, we attract our like. There are many at the discarnate leveis who have"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 20 talents just as we have talents. Some can paint; some are good in music; others investigate and utilize the Akashic records. They contact people on the physical plane who are psychically attuned. Occultists are usually somewhat psychic. Thus it often happens in psychic circles that some discarnate being, unable while on the physical level to attract the atiention he craved, seizes this opportunity to acquire a captive and obedient audience. Some discarnates, like the rest of us, will do anything to attract attention, like children standing on their heads and shouting, \"Look at me! Look at me!\" We all have this need for attention, and it is all right so long as we understand what we are doing and are able to smile at ourselves; it is part of the act of living. We all like to think that we are fascinating. The secret is to become fascinating. The secret of becoming fascinating is to persevere with the Tarot work. Developing a magnetic intensity has an effect on people which is incredible. Attracting attention to control others, however, leads to trouble. On the discarnate levels, those who could not gain enough attention here find that they can gain attention from incarnates just by being discarnate. They find that many psychics attribute all knowledge to them. They flood in through clairvoyance, through clairaudience, and make pronouncements about anything and everything. If they are clever, they say many things ihut ur\" quite true. It is easy to look facts up in the Akashic records, if you know how to travel there, It is as easy as gettingyour car to go to the Planetarium if you know the road' Such discarnates can excite their audience easily, and then proceed to deliver some of the most trite teachings. They cater to the vanity of their hearers. Now, occasionally, one may contact a discarnate being who is just as evolved and sensibie as someone here. I doubt if ihe perceniages are any different. There are caSes of very lovely beings who have wisdom, and it is good to discuss things with them. Uniortunately, the tendency of people who develop inner hearing on the psychic levels is to absorb and take in whatever these beings say. They will ask their advice on all sorts of matters. Imagine asking another human being simply because he happens to be discarnate! Imagine letting someone else tell you what to do with, or how to direct, your life! Yet many p.opl. do just this, and they have to suffer the repercussions of their actions until they i.u* better. Of course, we can have very fine contacts with friends on the other side. I have had this experience and appreciated it very much. But if any of my friends on the other side dared to try to help me manage my life, I would be most indignant. We can develop our contact with the Inner Teacher without having to stumble through the psychic road. In an earlier course, Dr. Case warned you about this quite fully' The true Inner Teacher does not flatter; it does not tell you what to do. You may say, \"Well, how do we know what to do if we have no one to guide us?\" But you have! You certainly have someone to guide you, and you must learn how to be receptive to that guidance. The point is that the guidance is not given in terms of concrete directions . . . you are given principles. There is a great difference between psychic messages, which most of you will sooner or later receive, and the Inner Teaching. There is nothing wrong with receiving psychic messages, so long as you know them for what they are, no more than there is anything wrongwith picking up the telephone and talking with a friend across the country. But if you are a psychic, you have to exercise careful discrimination. Your psychism is apparent to thor. on the astral plane. Hence, low-grade discarnate beings will work very hard to gain"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 20 your attention. They will pose as great teachers in order to seem important, if you let them; yet if you had met these persons in the flesh, you probably would not have been impressed at all. Such entities do furnish very insidious tests to the aspirant. They tell the aspirant he is different from other people, that he is very highly evolved, or that he has a gteat mission. Watch out for messages of this kind. Such messages are sent to lure the consciousness into the psychic levels. They will impair your spiritual development and lead you away from contact with your true Inner Teacher. For the rest of this week, meditate on the meaning of the kneeling figures before The Hierophant. Remember, the one with roses on his back syrnbolizes your desire nature. The one with lilies portrays your knowledge. To receive true teaching from the Higher Self, the Inner Teacher, all the desires we hold that are immature, selfish, self-centered, etc. . . . these we must be willing to give up. The knowledge that we are so proud of . . . the need to feed our little ego . . . these, too, we must be willing to relinquish to the Higher Self for transmutation. Examine then the things you think you know and the qualities of your desires for the rest of this week, mentally placing yourself in relationship to your Inner Teacher which The Hierophant exemplifies."}]
