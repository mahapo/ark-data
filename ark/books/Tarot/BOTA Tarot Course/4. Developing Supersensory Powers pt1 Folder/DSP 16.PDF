[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC FXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS LESSON 16 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures In this lesson we shall begin to study Tarot Key No. 3, The Empress, assigned among other things, to the power of creative imagination. What, then, is creative imagination? According to esoteric teaching the universe has come forth by means of the imagining of the Creator, so that everything in the universe that we can see, and everything in the universe that we do not see, eve4rthing that manifests at any time or any place, is said to be the result of the imagination of the Lord of Life, Thus it is said that the universe is a result of the creative imagination of the Lord of Life. I know there are some who would say that the results of God's imagination seem to need much improvement, considering the state of the world. Since I, in the days before I entered our Order had said something of that kind many times, I sympathize with such indignation. Nevertheless, we must remember that what we see is only a partial picture, just as you cannot foresee the appearance of a mature human being by looking at a human embryo of a week, or a month, or even several months. God's view of the universe is very different from ours. From our limited point of view, this glorious universe may not look beautiful at all. Our consciousness is limited, therefore, the data upon which we base our judgment is incomplete. Since we see only a very small part of the entire picture, we must remember that we have not evolved the ability nor the capacity to see a fuller picture. Realizing this limitation should keep rrs from anxiety and anger, from succumbing to the great errors of condemnation, of hatred, of frustration and the host of other negative emotions that only create problems. It is true that such negative emotional reactions to the universe as it seems cannot be wholly prevented, because we have still more self-evolution ahead. In this course you are learning more about the principles of consciousness, so that you can use them consciously in order to become more completely evolved. This means not only becoming more conscious co-creators with the Lord of Life, but also developing the ability to use consciously those powers that we have been using subconsciously and without awareness. If we have admired or envied certain people as being \"psychic,\" we have failed to realize that we possess these same powers ourselves, and that being \"psychic\" confers no additional power . . . indeed it confers only extra problems. What we should seek is controlled supersensory perception which can be summoned at will and as quickly turned off. Those who cannot control their personal \"psychism\" may easily become lost on levels at which our attention should not be arrested. Conscious control of these \"psychic\" powers is the goal towards which we are working and if we persevere, we shall gain it. Creative imagination is said, in Qabalah, to be that part of the Universal Expression which may be termed the Mother Principle. The concept of God as the Mother is, unfortunately, unfamiliar to most Westerners. In later western religious development, ignoring the concept that God is Mother as well as Father has resulted in a great loss. The principle has been denied by certain religious developments, and in others has taken on forms that are not acceptable to the rational mind. Yet, in the ancient esoteric teachings and in the ancient religious theologies, the mother aspect of God has always been given equal prominence with the father aspect. One of the things that has impeded the evolution"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 16 of consciousness in humanity as a whole has been an inability to understand that God is mother as well as father, and that the mother principle of God is the formative element involved in the creative imaginings of life. You will understand this concept even more fully as you progress through the rest of the Tarot Keys in this series. As you have learned, these Keys represent either the male or the female principle, separately or else both principles as a unit. These Keys, which include the results of the proper balancing of the two sides of our nature, the balancing of the male-female relationship, are brought to your attention at this point to remind you of those great emotional problems which are created by the mental-emotional relationships that children hold towards their mothers. This tlpe of emotional conflict can relate to situations where the mother has left the physical plane, or where the child unconsciously wishes that the mother would die, or where the child is tied to the mother, living in fear that she will leave him. Whichever the emotional reaction may be to the mother image, it is always a strong one. Modern psychologr is on the right track with this problem, though it has misinterpreted its findings. Our whole inner subconscious relationship to the mother concept holds the secret to our emotional security! It is important to recognize this and do something about it. A certain experience brought the truth of this home to me, I was in New York on a tragic journey that had to do with my own mother. Having returned to my hotel room, after attending to certain duties that grieved my soul to the depths, grief overwhelmed me, As the images washed through my mind as to what I had to do and what it involved, I kept thinking of the Qabalistic teaching regerding the Cosmic Mother, Binah, also called Aima, and I tried to delve into this principle in some way for help. About ten feet from my bed was a window which I had earlier observed. I had viewed the draperies there with the thought that they would suit my own home better than others I had previously considered. Thus, I had become familiar with both the drapes and the window, There was a cornice box above the drapes which I had examined thoroughly, and I knew that it was empty. Suddenly I noticed that there was a mist forming right there on the cornice . . . a cloud was developing! After the two minutes it took the cloud to form, I saw a little figurine about two inches high slowly appear. When I took it down from the cornice, the figurine was warm to my touch. At this point, I did not know its name, but when I showed it to several people, I was told it was called \"Our Lady of Grace.\" It now sits on a shelf in my home for all to see. It is nothing special to look at; you can get one like it in any religious store. \"Our Lady of Grace\" is associated with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, in the Roman Catholic Church. A great portion of the ideas related to Mary were adapted by the Roman Catholics from earlier mystery school teachings. These teachings were altered in some cases, and some of their own conceptions were added. Ne'vertheless, the eoncept of the Cosmic Mother, the female principle, has always existed in esoteric schools at d in Eastern exoteric religions\" Because of the meaning behind it, I knew this manifestation was a message to me from the Master of our work. The particular Sephirah assigned to the Cosmic Mother also represents the Third Order of Esoteric Initiation. The Masters of the Inner Schools are members of the Third Order and beyond any concept possible on the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 16 3 earth plane. Binah, the Cosmic Mother, is a s5rmbol for that Order, so I knew that this was a veryspecial message, as well as a gift from the Masters, and I was comforted. In Qabalah, the Cosmic Mother is refened to as the Divine Grace or the Grace of God, and this is the female principle. This is a message that is very significant. Now it was certainly not my creative imagination that brought this figurine to me. _ It was the creative imagination of someone with far greater power. Here is what happened: Those who have attained to almost incredible control of the outer environment have done so as a result of the control of consciousness, acceptingthe two premises--(1) it is consciousness that creates, and (2) the universe is a mental image in the mind of God. Consciousness imagines, therefore consciousness creates; and it is only as you learn to understand your own consciousness that you create properly. Among the powers of your consciousness, you must include the driving force of your emotional nature, because your emotions cannot be separated from what you think of as your mind. They are likened to the two sides of a single coin--like God, the mother, and God, the father. In Qabalah these two aspects are considered to be eternally conjoined. It is natural when we look at the Empress to realize that there also must be an Emperor. The next Key that we shall review is the Emperor. The Empress is a wife, and it is otvious that she is pregnant with the form of life. The Empress is the Hebrew letter \"Daleth,\" the womb of life, the door through which all things come' This, then, was the principle involved in this apport. if that be the technical term for this little bit of magic that ..*\" lo me and brought me so much comfort. Apports, while thought to be common only in some psychic circles, really are not at all unusual anywhere. Those incidents which occur when people are alone are seldom heard of, and yet they occur more often than many realize. The power to produce apports is not limited to Masters of Wisdom. One follower of the Left Hand Path had the power to dissolve certain physical objects. He could not dissolve a hard, solid thing, but he could work with vegetable matter. Not once, but several times, he was seen by Dr. Case to take a rose in his hand. He would close his hand and the color of the rose would be removed. He would close his hand again, and the flower would evaporate. He would say, \"Where would you like to find it?\" Someone would answer, for example, \"Upstairs in your study, behind the piano.\" They would look, and there they would find the rose. This man was no Master of Wisdom, but he developed that degree of psychic power. Having power does not mean that you are spiritual. When you develop real spirituality, there is a certain power that usually comes with it; but most people do not rialize that it has to be worked on and directed consciously. Thus, the production of an apport involves the ability to dissolve the molecular structure of an object through concentration and reproduce it in another area. It is the power of mental imagery that does this, the creative imagination that is assigned to Tarot Key 3, Different types of mental imagery help you understand more about the powers of consciousness. Actually, every time that you make a demonstration taught to you by our elementary course material, you have been using that same principle. I have often said that elementary metaphysics is a wonderful thing for beginners, except that it does not work consistently. But everyone who stays in elementary metaphysics says,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 16 \"The reason that it doesn't work is that I have not learned to keep my thoughts positive.\" Merely working hard, knitting your brow and gritting your teeth to learn how to keep your thoughts positive will never work at all; it will generally only make things worse, because subconsciousness immediately picks up the resistance and troubles collect fast and furiously. We must learn to understand the actual principles of consciousness and how they work and how they interrelate in all their ramifications. We must work to intensify our own alert awareness, as well as our image-making powers, and begin to recognize what goes on in our own souls, and begin to watch our own subconscious processes. This is what you should learn from this course. As you learn to do these things, you automatically develop a better ability and capacity to hold your thoughts positively focused. Remember, however, that what is positive to one may not be positive to another. You have read in an earlier lesson of the person who thought and thought in order to \"demonstrate\" to himself a fortune, thousands of dollars; one day there it was--as a bank teller he was handling all of that money, but it belonged to others. Unless you know the laws of consciousness, this is the sort of thing that happens. People who try to \"demonstrate\" in various areas usually have little flaws in their image making, flaws that bring on frustrations; but they should learn to understand that whal they have been doing with their consciousness is unwise. The pair of opposites assigned to this Tarot Key is Wisdom and Folly. He who is wise automatically holds the proper imagery and knows how to create in the positive sense; the reverse is true of one who is filled with folly, This is a necessary relationship; this is how we grow. We must develop our understanding of what it is we have been doing so long with these basic powers. We must understand how these principles work, so that we can more rapidly become what we are eventually destined to be; conscious co-creators with God. Let us consider again the maternal aspect of God, and see why it is so important to develop our own mental relationships with the female principle. I should not have been able to speak to you about this particular work with so much profound conviction, although conviction is too weak a word, save that the experience I have related led to meditation on and an insight into the principle of the female aspect of life and the meaning of God as mother. True implication of this principle is staggering. I wish to pass on to you the realizations that came to me, so thatyou, too, can begin transmutation of your emotional patterns in relation to the female principle. Consider first, how were we born? Accepting the premise that all things come about through God's imagery, it becomes a little ridiculous to say that we were born because an ovum and a spermatozoon came together. That meeting is one aspect of the picture on the material plane, but it certainly can't be the reason for it. The esoteric teaching on this subject helps give a better concept of this aspect of God, In actuality, the soul has an image of itself. Now, you have a picture of yourself, as everyone does. If you do not say, \"I am pretty; I am enchanting; I am graceful,\" most of the time, for fear that people will say that you are conceited, secretly you may think so. My sister at the age of five was so overwhelmed with herself that she wondered how anybody could be so perfect. She said, \"I'm the most perfect thing in the universe!\" I felt the same, except I had private"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 16 5 reservations about a few points! So she was a bit more entranced than I. Everyone carries an image of himself, no matter whether this image is true or not. Actually, the image we cafty depends on our evolutionary self-perception, The self image may or may not be accurate. Change your self image and you change your personalify. The image of the soul or the individuality is actually a matrix, an electro-magnetic matrix. It is this image that is attracted into manifestation as a new life by the electro-magnetic phenomenon that occurs between husband and wife when conception takes place. There must be magnetic attraction for a soul to be drawn into incarnation, either through karma or through love, which is an aspect of karma. The magnetic attraction takes place as an aspect of the nature of the electro-magnetic field that accompanies and is generated by the reproductive act. The image, then, which the Individuality holds is magnetically attracted to the physical plane through the mating of the mother and the father. It then draws to itself the physical substance needed to grow its image into physical being, but the image is already there. This is why we usually look very much alike from incarnation to incarnation. We change types very little unless we work hard to reform the images of ourselves. We usually have the same t5rye of body and features. If we have formed the image of ourselves as having, for example, an oval face, we shall probably continue to have one, unless we develop an attachment for a round face and keep seeing ourselves with a round face. It is rather difficult to change this matrix, but it can be done. So you can even change your type of form, though you will have to wait for another incarnation to do a complete job of it if you don't like what you have now. It is better to be as entranced as my sister was, and then the form automatically becomes beautiful, for true beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When we think that something is beautiful from an external appearance, this is the greatest illusion. Real beauty comes from our response to it. It comes from our response to a tree, or a flower, or a person; it does not reside within the person or the flower or the tree. Again, it is our creative imagination at work that gives the experience of beauty. We all develop a thirst for beauty, that is, as we flrnd the beauty, our creative imagination makes us what we seek, makes us what we feel. We do not have to work to change the shape of our face or our body. Beauty is as we conceive it to be. Project the concept of beauty upon the creations of Life for the rest of this week. Pay attention to the self-images of Mother Nature which She shares with us to the limit of our own capacities. Reach for the wonder of the intricate forms, colors and textures that are strewn about you by the lavish creativity of the Universal Self. Thus will you learn to partake of the nourishing beauty of the Divine."}]
