[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPER,SENSORY POWERS LESSON 14 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures The last two lessons dealt with self-conscious attention, which is Qabalistically associated with The Magician, self-consciousness, and with the pair of opposites, Life and Death. You were told that it is Life to be aware, and it is Death to meander through one's days unaware. The degree of livingness depends upon the degree of concentration and attention that is given to a thing. In this lesson we will speak of subconsciousness and of the High Priestess as our s5rmbolic representation of subconsciousness. The pair of opposites assigned to this Key is Peace and Strife. This attribution has a great deal to do with an understanding of our whole subconscious process and the supersensory functions that take place in and through subconsciousness. Occult teaching regards the mental substance of life as the basic substance of the universe. In order to give this substance a name, we use the term \"subconscious.\" Often one smiles at hearing people say that something \"is only subconsciousness.\" Only subconsciousness! Give a thing a name and many people think it has been explained. What do they mean by \"only subconsciousness?\" In essence, subconsciousness is the universal substance within which we live and move and have our being. Inasmuch as it is the Universal Substance in which we live and move and have our being, it actually contains the underlying pattern for that self-conscious livingness which was discussed in the previous lesson. Remember, the divisions of superconsciousness, subconsciousness and self-conscioltsness do not ha.ve clear lines of separaticn, one from the other. ?here is only One Consciousness, the Universal Substance. But this Universal Substance has many different aspects, many different levels of expression blending one into the other. We call one level self-consciousness; another superconsciousness, and yet another subconsciousness. Still, they all are interpermeating. There could be no such thing as self-consciousness without a subconscious substance as a foundation for consciousness or to provide the materials for consciousness. Consider, for example, \"the observer\" discussed in earlier lessons. What is it that really observes? It is the consciousness observing itself, perhaps after the manner of a dream, and yet it is not a dream. Our dreaming, however, does give an indication of the kind of power consciousness has on whatever level it is placed. In a dream you see things, you feel things, you experience things, you experience time and space, yet what is it that is the substance that \"makes the picture?\" What part of you does the experiencing? What, in fact, are the pictures? Do they occupy space? The action of a dream takes place entirely within your consciousness even though within the dream state; you seem to be aware of here and of there. You may have walked, climbed, traveled, met people, been joyful or sorrowful because of these pictures. Yet these images you have experienced have all taken place within your own mind. At the level of dreaming, the functioning consciousness is basically subconsciousness. When we consider our experiences in what is called \"waking life,\" we can, by analory, think of all things that we experience as physical things, as being the pictures or the images held inside the mind of God, held by the Universal Consciousness. The substance of life which, without question, is valid to our experiencing senses is to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: L4 superconscious knowledge something very different from what it seems to self- consciousness. The dream state gives an apparent solidity to dream things; in the waking state we recognize that these dream-state objects were not solid, And so it is with all of our physical world when viewed from the level of superconsciousness, For this reason, many schools of thought tell us that the physical universe is not real. This is not true. Universal Consciousness holds the pictorial images that we generate. The physical universe is real enough, but it is not what it seems to be. When your development attains to a superconscious awareness of life, you will discover that there are no questions of reality on any level of experience. These are merely matters of interpretation. Hence in the Western occult schools, in following the tradition of Qabalistic training, we stress that you must pay close attention to what is called the physical universe. Your conscious attention should be directed to what is going on in the here and now; but at the same time you should develop your awareness of the essence of livingness behind the physical form, so that in time, seeing the essence and the livingness, too, will become automatic. The awareness of a form and the living creative mind which imagines the form, and therefore lives that form, are not two separate things, but only two ways of expressing the same livingness of God. Subconsciousness is the secret path which we travel in order to experience this particular kind of awareness. This is necessary because it is in the subconscious level of universal consciousness that all memory of all that has ever been exists. You learned in elementary metaphysics that if you hold a certain image in your mind consistently and charge it with the proper emotion, it will manifest. Every advanced aspirant has had at least a few demonstrations of how the power of the mind creates the environment. Most aspirants can look back many years, even before entering occult studies, and analyze the changed and changing conditions around them which their own consciousness actuallv built. This occurred even before thev were aware of their creative power. It is not, therefore, a matter of learning to control the outer environment through the direction of the subconscious substance. This ability we have been given by virtue of being sons and daughters of God, by virtue of being aspects of the one, the whole, superconscious livingness. In fact, there is no way in which we can avoid using this power! What you are learning to do is to use this power under your own conscious direction. You are learning to direct it in terms of the higher knowing, so that your ignorance and frustrations will be transformed into something more approaching the heart's desire. You are becoming a conscious co-creator with God, instead of being an unconscious co-creator, This is the major difference. You are working toward the full understanding of your supersensory powers. You work not only to heighten your awareness of them, but also to deepen your understanding of levels which up to this point in your training have been unavailable to your self-consciousness, Your subconscious levels have alwavs been able to channel the various superconscious powers."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: L4 In connection with Tarot Key No. 2, we are going to discuss the power of telepathy in particular. Later, we shall take up creative imagination, which is also involved not only with the higher subconscious processes, but also with the superconscious knowingness that utilizes its subconscious substance. The many courses you have studied cannot, by themselves, bring you to an understanding of subconsciousness. It takes work, study, meditation and the practicing of these ideas in everyday living. These courses give you as comprehensive a knowledge as possible, but this knowledge, by its nature, is presented from the intellectual point of view. We shall, however, try to give you an intuitive feeling ofjust what subconsciousness is. As a matter of fact, this whole course is really aimed toward that goal. When you develop perception of the working of subconscious power, and as you become more aware of what you are capable of doing with this subconscious power, you will begin to utilize this ability more and more for superconscious experiences. This in turn will give you the ability to change your environment and your relationships with others. Peace and Strife are assigned to Tarot Key No. 2 because it is, in essence, subconscious power that gives us the ability to reflect our images to ourselves, and therefore to give us the experiences of things outside ourselves. It is this experience that creates the strife, because we seem to be not only different, but definitely separated from the rest of creation. This feeling of separation is the greatest delusion of all. Self-consciousness is not really the thinking power of the mind, although part of our illusion is that we think it is. If it really were, our thinking power would be in trouble. Self-consciousness is the power of holding the attention in one spot and then another, so that subconsciousness can take the images sensed and weave them into tbe fabric, that is, the pattern of images that it is already holding. If this were not a subconscious function, the whole body would fall apart. It is the subconscious mind that directs your heart to beat and your lungs to breathe. It is the subconscious that regulates the endocrine, the muscular and the nervous systems. Your subconscious mind does untold numbers of things simultaneously in every instant of life, so that you will be enabled to experience consciousness. Your ability to experience consciousness rests and depends upon the power of subconsciousness. That is why this power has so often been called by Qabalists tlie virgin substance, because naught can defile it. This is uniquely your substance. It is your primal, fluidic substance, and it is your bond with the One Life. Each of us has his own little garden to cultivate. The Magician's garden symbolizes the seed that grows in the consciousness. Tarot Key No. 2 may be thought of as the concept of Peace, which comes with the experience of the flow of subconsciousness as being, not only your own small thread of being, but that interwoven total fabric which you share with all of creation. In an earlier lesson, each individual subconscious mind was likened to an individual inlet of the one great ocean. It is this universal water from the same ocean that flows in and out of each and every inlet and bay. Yet within our own personal bay, we feel our own very specialized and unique group of personal memories and our own personal field of activity. Still, the water in that bay is but a part of the total ocean--One Substance, the One Consciousness, the One Life--and we are but part of the whole. We are distinct, but we are not separate. Notice in this Tarot Key that the scroll held by the High Priestess indicates subconscious registration of memory. The scroll is in the form of a spiral. This spiral scroll"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 14 is an important symbol in occultism. All of evolution is held to take place by motion through cyclic spirals. The essence of memory is this particular motion as incorporated, not into the body, but into the substance of the universal consciousness. It is not your body that registers memory. Your brain is a receiving and sending instrument like a radio, which receives certain of your memories, and those of others, and transmits your own impressions in a reciprocating outward flow. Very little is yet known, scientifically, about the physiolory of the brain. Some materialists claim that conscious memory is registered in the brain, and that memory will be lost if parts of the brain are removed. The Ancient Wisdom says, instead, that if a portion of the brain is damaged, certain memories for which it is supposed to be a register are unable to register. What happens may be compared to a broken key on a piano. You cannot play that note on the piano, even though you know the note and press your finger on the proper key. Keep this in mind at all times. Do not make the mistake of thinking that memory resides within the physical organism. At the same time, your physical organism is not separate from subconsciousness. It is a special aspect of it, an image that subconsciousness takes. Therefore, we might say memory is registered in that part of your physical organism which is metaphysical in substance. Subconsciousness creates an electromagnetic field, which in turn becomes the foundation and the pattern, or matrix, upon which and in which the atomic and molecular particles of the physical universe arrange themselves into the form which you call yourself. This foundation is a pulsating, oscillating, expanding and contracting fi,eld of energr, into which and out of which flow the universal currents, binding each part to the All. Subconsciousness, then, can not be said to be something separate and particular to any one person. It is a universal fluidic flow, and it is this part of consciousness that we must shape in order to experience self-conscious and superconscious awareness, We, as human beings, keep absorbing the knowingness from one level and drawing out from that level its part of universal knowledge, universal drive, universal evolutionary intention and experience. This is the source of our desires, the Universal Life. These desires might even be called life's promises, We bring desire from the pulsating ocean of universal life into our own personal bay--personal only in terms of the part that we and Divine Will are working on--and we bring these desires into self-conscious awareness, so that we may learn to work with them properly. We must, therefore, think of subconsciousness as something that we all share in, as a fluidic universal substance, as an ocean flowing in and out, permeating all things and all life, ever;rwhere. Our own part of it can be pictured as an eddy or a whirlpool directed in its motion by self-consciousness. Our whirlpool in the ocean really takes in water from the rest of the ocean and sends it back out. Our experience becomes part of the total life aspect. We take in a part of this ocean of subconscious material and sift it through ourselves, so that it comes out transformed into something else, something unique, As it flows back into the ocean, our own center of consciousness is expanded and our own whirlpool of self-conscious awareness grows larger and larger. This concept is incorporated into the fluidic aspect of the robe of the High Priestess."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI,ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: T4 This fluidity of the universal subconscious is the secret of the understanding of telepathy. Many advanced students have had definite awareness of this fluidic subconscious substance during telepathic experience, since this is the medium for telepathic transmission. I have a thought. Now, my thoughts register in only one place, and that is within the fluidic substance. If you happen to be tuned in to me, you will automatically receive my thoughts from the pulsating flow, but you will not be conscious of it. Telepathic communication has taken place. You have not been aware of it, so you may think telepathy occurs only at times. However, telepathy occurs at all times. There is never a time when telepathic communication does not take place between all living beings. In other words, our thoughts and emotions are not really as private as we would like to think. This may seem an unpleasant situation at times, considering many of the things we think and feel! But when we realize that we are all in the same boat--or rather ocean--we can chuckle and learn to accept its humorous aspects. What is telepathy? It is the shape that the mind has taken, an image the mind has received or sent. The mind attracts to itself the mental-emotional states that are in harmony with itself, be they productive of happy or unhappy experiences. In theory telepathy seems both good and useful; in practice it often seems uncomfortable. To summarize, telepathy is not something that happens intermittently or sporadically. There is no time that it is not taking place. Since we all share the one universal fluidic mental substance, and since it is constantly circulating back and forth between ourselves and others, there is no time that these shared images are not affecting both others and ourselves. To become consciously aware of telepathy is simple. First of all, recognize the principle behind its operation. Recognition of the underlying principle will start your consciousness automatically concentrating its attention in the manner and with the results that have been described in earlier lessons. Only as your attention is focused do you learn to use the power of perception. This perception will give you insight into and beyond the apparent form to the subconscious power behind the form. Not all people, it must be said, experience telepathy as a fluidic interchange. Some people simply see an image. This is clairvoyance. The fluidic aspect is felt by those who happen to be clairsentient, i.e. having supersensory awareness of astral substance. Interestingly enough, insanity is closely related to telepathy. Do you know what insanity really is? Insanify is the retirement of self-conscious objective awareness into the depths of subconscious illusion. Obsessions, too, arise from being lost in the subconscious realm. When the conscious self has lost its control, subconsciousness takes over in ever-increasing degrees, freely flooding the mind with all sorts of imagery. Self- consciousness sees these subconscious images, which include fears, hates, terrors, and desires of all types and descriptions. In addition to one's own thought forms of personal memory patterns, there are layers upon layers of deeper subconsciousness. Uncontrolled self-consciousness often wanders into the subconscious world because it finds the strains and pressures of the physical world intolerable. Consciousness yearns to give up its problems, and instead of evolving, often regresses so deeply into subconscious levels that it is unable to find the way back to self-conscious controls. We return home, we travel the 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: t4 paths of return, through achieving the full expression of self-conscious powers, not by iegressing to the primeval substance, which can also be thought of as the lower astral world' The psychotic, of course, do not realize that they have left conscious reality, just as in a dream everything we touch and feel and taste is real to us. They are sure that the voices they hear, the threats that are made, the vibrations that they experience are real and have their source in other people who are opposing them. Sometimes this is true; but more often it is not. Most of the time their illusions are caused by the gradual submerging of self-consciousness into primeval substance, which is something we should learn to control and not be controlled by. It is important to understand this, for thus we can safeguard ourselves against the negative aspects of various psychic powers. Many occult schools have discouraged the development of psychic powers because, without proper safeguards and controls, psychic ability promotes the tendency towards submersion into subconscious life, escaping the duties of conscious being. This, too, is a form of psychosis, in which we become unable to orient ourselves with realistic concentration. We should be oriented while we are in the physical vehicle at the physical world level."}]
