[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ESOTERIC EXTENSION OF TAROT TO DEVELOP SUPERSENSORY POWERS Lesson 19 Transcriptions from Ann Davies' Class Lectures We have mentioned the need to look carefully in order to see. Now, how do we learn to do this? First of all, we must recognize that what the physical eye sees is only a partial picture. Therefore, we need to develop the habit of looking at people with the power of Tarot Key #4, The Emperor, in the background of our minds! What is it to look with the power of the Emperor? Usually we are very casual in our examination of each other. That is why it is so easy to be hoodwinked. We tend to take everyone else at surface value, We must learn how to give close attention to people, not in order to outwit or even analyze them, but in order to see into them at all levels, becoming fully aware of their personalities. At the same time we must accept and recognize their God level, realizing that personality is a struggling infant. Thus if we would learn to cope with people and with life from the vantage point of Reality, we must be certain that we are not exposing ourselves to the weaknesses and the empty spaces of another's undeveloped personality. By developing our own deep perceptions, we tend to fill our own empty spaces and substitute strengths for weaknesses. Hence, when you see a person, when you live with a person, when you meet a person, or whenyou just talk to a person, you should pay such close attention that even the twitch of an eyebrow does not escape you. You must learn to look at all of the details of personality. You will be amazed at the understandingyou will gain and how much more .sympathetie you will feel towards others. This will also enable you to beg:n seeing through the masks people hide behind. We all cover ourselves with a facade; we all play a part. We want people to see us in a certain light so we act in ways calculated to produce this picture. When we meet people, we want them to think we are intelligent and attractive; there is nothing wrong with this. The point is that if we wish to develop perceptiveness, we must watch our own posturing, too. \"Why am I posturing?\" Then we shall be able to see why other people posture. In this way we learn to see beneath the surface and into the hearts of mankind. When we see into hearts, we decide that all hearts are much the same. Everyone is somewhat lonely; everyone wants to be loved, whether he admits it or not. Everyone yearns to be understood, whether he is given to understanding or not. Everyone feels insecure, whether he is willing to give other people security or not. There is a hungry yearning in the heart, whether well covered or not; this is what we discover when we learn how to watch and how to look. As we look and watch, we shall be able to help others to find what they are searching for. Some people, we will discover, are so shy they seem willing to do nothing to receive attention, understandingor love. If you become aware of their sh5mess,you will cease to think of them as arrogant. Most of the people whom we think arrogant are really only shy. When you do not look beneath the surface, you miss an opportunity to lift the heart of one of God's children. Be concerned, and you will perceive their inner nature. If you find that some people have a need to disparage others, what could be the reason but insecurity? Of course this is an immature way to compensate for, or offset insecurity. When you recognize that another person uses this immature method for offsetting his feelings of insecurity, you will realize that he may tear you down, too. When"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 19 you recognize this, you will no more hate such a person than you would hate an infant for falling down. You will learn to see and understand and thus be able to deal with the situation more constructively. Gradually, you will see more and more into other areas of the being. You will discover that no one is all good and no one is all bad. Who can be all good? Even as Jesus said, \"Call no one good but the Father.\" Too often we have not even a conception of what it is to be good. We have been conditioned with much that is nonsense as to w6at goodness really involves. Some people consider others good if they go to church every Sunday and don't smoke, drink or swear. Others equate goodness with dietary habits or degrees of sexual continence. You cannot learn to be objective about people if you hold strongly preconceived ideas of what it is to be good or bad. You must be willing to shift your views, to reason things out, That is what we are discussing, the reasoning capacity, and reasoning has to do w]th the ability to see and to remember and to imagine. If you can imagine yourself in the other person's place, you will reason more accurately about his conduct. You can use this imaging power also to reason accurately about the activity you should undertake for certain speci*al - problems. The reasoning faculty is the constitution, you might say, of your environment, the framer of your world. Actually, it is the way in which you interpret yourself and the world that makes your tomorrow. What you are is what you will become. Your environment and your experienees will express rvhat 5'ou basically are. How are you to overcome the problem of surface seeing? We shall give you a technique at the end of this lesson. With Tarot Key 4, however, just practicinga technique is not enough, You will have to retrain yourself into seeing with the deep.r vision that develops true perception into the hearts of others and greater rulership orr\", yourself and your environment, You are the one who always rules your world, whether you realize it or not. you have made your rules, you have made your laws, and when you break them you even punish yourself, from that deeper level of being. As we frame new interpretations for subconsciousness, we teach ourselves to step away from our old habits of seeing and become truly aware of what it is that looks out at us from the eyes of other human beings. This is the acme of seeing, We shall try to teach you to search every pair of eyes, looking for that miracle, that Higher Self. Curiously \"rrorg-h, u, you do this, you will strengthen the evolutionary factors within that other p\"\".or,, just by virtue of looking. The color associated with this key is a brilliant, true red. Some schools of thought teach that only pastel shades are spiritual. Whenever they want to speak of someone whom they consider spiritual they say, \"Oh, what lovely pastel lavenders and gr\"ens and pinks in the aura.\" Too much pastel usually denotes a pastel personalit5r, one that has much livingness to develop. Not that pastels are not lovely, but what is wrong with the vivid colors, too?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 19 The Lord of Life is all things, and all signs of the Zodiac take in all colors. There is no color that is unspiritual; every color has its special meaning, as you will learn in our work in sound and color. Please do not fall into the trap, as many occult students do, of thinking that pastel colors denote the ethereal and spiritual, and brilliant colors the animal. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Anyone with real psychic vision knows that colors become on the astral more vivid than they are on the physical plane; even if you have had but one experience of this you know the astonishing brilliance of the colors, far beyond what you experience on the physical plane of being. Vividness is not unspiritual! As a matter of fact, as we work toward expansion of consciousness and attaining the various supersensory powers that go with it, we firnd that vividness in both awareness and feeling is a part of growbh. Vividness of colors and delicate shading are all the garments of the Lord. The red of Key 4, The Emperor, symbolizes action, the force of Mars, the drive of rulership. There is no doubting the action and drive inherent in rulership. You must learn to rule your own thoughts and your own emotions first, thus preparing yourself to rule in other areas. To the degree that you rule your own consciousness, to that degree do you become the ruler of other elements in your environment. It is your duty to God and to your own Higher Soul to do just that, to work at becoming a strong ruling power. Be careful not to confuse this with the power complex. The difference is the concept that God is the power ruling through personality, as the Emperor depicts. People who have the need to rule or ruin do not think in terms of \"God as the power through them.\" In their insecurity they must crush anyone who stands in their way. I suppose we have all been subjected to this unhappy type at some time or other. You can learn to recognize and protect yourself from these destructive types. Just as we protect delicate china from the hands of a baby who is learning to walk, we can protect the delicate parts of ourselves from being broken by people who are still wobbling infants, as we are in some ways, too. We, however, can help; we have the means of growing up beyond the mass mind. In doing so, we are being helped from levels beyond anything that we can comprehend as we work together with these keys. The Tarot keys are more than a set of symbols in harmony with consciousness. They are the means with which telepathic contact and aid are given you from higher levels by Those who employ them as a channel. Certain ideas, certain emotional forces are being broadcast at all times through these pictorial images, If you work with them, you become more and more open to transmutation from the higher intelligences, those who have advanced beyond ourselves, as well as developing more and more Powers to work with ourselves. And it is work. I know that many of you have already experienced an unbelievable difference in yourselves\" It is a continuous transmutation, and you must have stamina to stay with it, because even at this advanced stage in our search for illumination we are put through many subtle tests. At present, we want you to keep in mind the idea of rulership; developing real control of our thinking and feeling processes. As king, we must become aware of the realm of our inner nature."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 19 When you find yourself drifting off into negation, dwelling on the unhappy experiences of yesterday, or fearing what tomorrow will bring, remember that within you is the power that the Emperor symbolizes, This power of reason can help you lift your consciousness. Whatever appears to be adverse is never really adverse. It is merely an experience you go through as the result of yesterday. It brings you perception, the ability to see. The moment you avoid putting energies into experiences of sonow and complaint you will become more open to receive help from higher forces. The Emperor is a symbol of your power of vision, your power to perceive thought and emotion more readily than you have in the past. Give your problems to that Ruler within for more acute reasoning, for more accurate interpretation. The reasoning faculty is basically an interpretive facult5r. Remember that we become whatever we interpret life as being, therefore the outcome of any problem depends on our correct use of the reasoning faculties. For example, you might feel dependent on someone. The person might have traits which, if you perceived them accurately, would indicate his inability to take responsibility. Yet, because you do feel dependent, you mentally or emotionally close your eyes until too late and catastrophe strikes! Actually, if you are willing to see reality you will perceive more readily, be able to reason and handle the situation in such a way as to avoid pain. We are meant to overcome pain. Do not think that pain is an inevitable and permanent part of life, It is not. The ability to be willing to see the real, rather than rvear blinders, rvill free ycu frcrn it. The Emperor has to do with seeing ability. Therefore, after permeating yourself with the red of Aries as outlined in the technique which follows, liftyourself and your emotions to the Universal King and Ruler. He syrnbolizes and is an aspect of your true self. Lift your heart to that Ruler, the real interpreter of life, He who truly sees. Let the Emperor truly see through your personality, Lift your heart to That, and in essence say, \"I am willing to see reality whatever it is, because reality is good. Help me to let You be the seer through my eyes wherever I go, whatever I do.\" Try to hold that attitude of mind for several moments. The art of true seeing should be performed almost continuously. Try to keep a memory of its working within you. Develop within yourself a constructive compulsion, so that whenever you look at a tree, you say to yourself, \"God sees this tree through my eyes.\" Then look carefully at the details. Try to see every little detail you can. You will be amazed at how your sense of color will develop. You will become much more sensitive to colors and forms\" When you look at a little creature, look at it in detail. Focus your seeing properly, and as you do you will begin to see into and not merely at surfaces. The way to develop a real clairvoyance that sees into is simply to learn how to look and look and look. The looking has to have a sense of marvel in it. The wonder of the color of the sky! If it is raining, the miracle of the sparkling drops. With people, you will have to learn realllr to look. With nature, animals, babies, scenery, it is very easy to feel the sense of wonder and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CI\"ASSWORK ON SUPERSENSORY POWERS: 19 awe. Watch color very carefully. If you are looking at mountains, do not simply look at the form; notice the graduated colors of the violet, gray and charcoal. Train your attention so that it takes in detail, and then you will take in more and more until finally you see a thing in its subtle aspect, its psychic and spiritual sense. You do not need to get away from the world to develop supersensory perception. Why else would God have put you here? What you need to do is to see what this world really is, by seeing through surface appearances, thus expanding your consciousness and the powers of your being. This is attaining to your real Sonship or Daughtership with the Divine. I admit that it is very difficult to feel awed about people, on the whole, unless you are in love. But \"in love\" is usually limited to one person and should be expanded to include all. The lover looks at the world with a heightened perception because his consciousness is heightened. The consciousness is actually heightened when one is in love. We have to learn how to be in love all of the time with life and with God. This should not preclude other kinds of love, but enlarges our capacities for loving. Inasmuch as it is such a delightful state, we should welcome it. To begin in the easiest way, start seeking the wonder in those you love the most. Practice watching all the details of their faces, of their expressions, of their voices. No longer be satisfied with surface looking. After a while, this will become habitual and you will not have to think about it; you will automatically firnd yourself giving attention to all the details that are involved in any human being, What will happen in terms of your relationships to people and your perceptions is beyond anything I can describe. You will gather more and more data for accurate reasoning. This habitual attitude we are describing will make living much more alive for you. And this is what we want, because our supersensory powers lie in those areas. In conclusion, in using the techniques for Tarot Keys 3 and 4, remember to raise your consciousness up to the Emperor and Empress for they are the male and female aspect of the Godhead and the whole influx of energr is much more potent if you imaginatively lift yourself up to the powers represented by these two Tarot keys. TECHNIQUB FOR TAROT KEY NO. 4, THE EMPEROR Follow the procedures as previously outlined. Immerse yourself in brilliant scarlet red. See Tarot Key 4 above you in full life size and in three dimensions. Notice the Emperor sitting on the cube, symbol of manifestation. Examine the design on the cube. Note the Emperor's armor. Reason is the shield that protects us from becoming caught up in destructive forces. The staff of dominion indicates rulership of the reasoning faculty.
