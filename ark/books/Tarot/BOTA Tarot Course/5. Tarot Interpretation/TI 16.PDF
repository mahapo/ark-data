One of the general meanings of this group, shown by every row of thlee I(eys when they are arranged in magic order, is that the Unmanifested Spirit (0) is the real power finding expression through the generation of mental imagery in the field of subconsciousness. Ageless Wisdorn avoids a mistake of some modern systems of psychology which suppose subconsciousness has a power of its own which is merely an echo of earlier stages of evolution. Wrat psychoanalysts term the libido is really the elan vital of undifferentiated Spirit. It is the pure Lifb-Breath, the sky-power pictured by the Fool. As you receive it, it comes into your field of awareness through subconscious channels. Yet it is not a power of subconsciousness. You make contact with it through subconsciousness.

Key 3 is a syrnbol of the main idea in the doctrine of this lesson. This idea is closely connected with the meanings of the letter' Daleth (1), corresponding to the Empress. Daleth means \"door,\" and its significance as applied to your work is this: The activities of subconsciousness in the generation of mental images constitute the porlal through which you pass from your present states of personal experience into those you are to reahze in the luture. You have entered today's set of experiences through this door. Through it you will pass into the conditions of tomorro\\,v. What you image today will become a pattern fbr the manifestations of days to come. That this is true is not by any means patent to the greater number of human beings. Many reiect it. They say: \"l certainly did not imagine anything like the experiences I am having now. FIow, then, can you ask me to believe that what I imagine now will make any difference in n-ry actual life tomorrow?\" This would be sound criticism were all mental imagery produced consciously. Actually. relatively l'ew of your images are consciousiy shaped unless yolr are exceptionally skillful in directing thc process. Your subconsciousness generates thousands of irnages every day. Each has a measure of effect on your relations with others and on your circumstances. Often they do not rise to the conscious level at all, but they nake a difl'erence just the same. Subconsciousness is the dream-maker. It spins the rveb of imagery day and night. While awal<e we seldom notice tliis dream-process. Our attention is captured by the more vivid impressions of sense-experience. Nevertheless, subconsciousness goes right on and since many of these images affect other persons, both directly and telepathically, they condition the way others react to us and how they oppose or aid us in our undertakings. You can direct this subconscious activity so that it will work to your advantage. You manage it trom the self--conscious level. You do this now. The power is already yours. Possibly you have often worked the controls in reverse Remember, your subconscious dream-process is an automatic response to, and elaboration of, your conscious mental attitudes. When you let yourself get into the habit of thinking this is a pretty terrible world and that your hopes of realizing your heart's desire are \"nothing but dreams,\" you plant a seecl-thought your subconsciousness will elaborate into specilic imagery. Don't plan for failure that wayl"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"T A ItO'f I N T E II P R E'I' A T I O N : These images may never rise into your field of conscious awareness. Yet they are being cleveloped and some of them are amazinely strong. Your bad dreams sometimes give you terriffing glimpses of the kind of product turned out by your subconscious image-factory. Learn how to direct your mental powers and you will not be bothered by bad dreams. The seed-thought you plant will not be the kind that grow into nightmare shape. Ageless Wisdom says the image-making activities of your personal subconsciousness are the same in kind, though less potent in degree, as those whereby the physical lbrms of the world were brought forth by the Universal Mind. Imagination is thus actually the door to external experience. To trace the various elements of your present situation to their subconscious roots is difficult, even impossible. Yet you will do well to remember the principle. I{ebrew Wisdom gives another hint to the same effect. It says Daleth, the door, is also a symbol for the womb. Daleth represents the matrix in which conditions are shaped. This idea is brought out by many details of the Tarot picture of the Empress. 'f'here should be nothing to disturb you in considering the close connection between your subconscious imagery and your conscious experience. You are not determined, as some have taught, by subconscious states over which you have no control. You do control them. You always control them even when you set into operation the production of sequences of images whose externalization is decidedly unfavorable to you and your projects. The trouble is, when trouble comes, that you have been misusing your control. Learn to use it aright and trouble comes to an end, 'fhe principle of control is very simple. Subconsciousness accepts whatever we accept at the cotrscious level of our thought. Subconsciousness cannot criticize or repudiate our conscious notions. It takes for gospel everything that we believe, and it elaborates whatever we give it to the last possible deduction liom the premises we establish by our conscious mental attitudes. Because it does elaborate your conscious thoughts, you often experience conditions you seem not to have imagined at all. This is where you have to guard against making misinterpretations of experience at the conscious level. You must be on watch also against falling into easy agreement with sorne other person's ill-considered opinion. Learn to determine fbr yourself what yoll accept. This is particularly important in these days when so many influences play upon us from the printed page, from motion pictures, and from the radio and television. All these media are employed by propagandists in order to plant suggestions in the race-mind. Deliberate misuse o f suggestion in order to further the purposes of the few at the expense of the many is the modern adaptation of black magic. We see its evil results on every hand. 10"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRDT-ATION. I6 Less obvious but analogous and equally evil is the deliberate use by propagandists of the non-sequence; \"Mohammedans do not drink alcohol and neither do Kansas Prohibitionists. Therefore Kansas Prohibitionists are Mohammedans.\" Ridiculous, isn't it? But how about this one? \"The white races are leaders in science and technology and America has the highest standard of all life of any place in the world. Therefore Americans are the most civilized people on earth.\" Many people might swallow this statement at one gulp, but philosophers and metaphysicians would see the non-sequence between material wealth and spiritual attainment at once. The multiplication of honest effors by print and by radio is almost as dangerous as malicious propaganda. In these days we need to be prepared to make positive counter-suggestions to a great number of negative statements we hear and read almost every waking hour of our lives. Our counter-suggestions should be developments of a logical conception of the sorl of world we actrLally live in. I(ey 10, the central picture in our tableau, and central also in the corresponding magic sqllare, is important in this comection. It sums up symbolically the main aspccts of a seed-thought which is sure to bear fruit in beneficent mental imagery. The person who has thought out and consciously accepted the idea represented by Key 10 will, by repeated rneditation on that idea, set going a subconscious creative process which will eventually be the means of his liberation. You have had some introduction to this idea in the lessons of TAROT FLINDAMENTALS and its various aspects have been touched upon in preceding lessons of this series. 'fhe emphasis this week will fall on this great seed-idea which rnay be put into words as follows: ln the stnallest details of personal experience and action, the forces at work are not merely personal: they are phases also of a cosmic process of cyclic activity which moves inevitably toward the rnanil'estation of a beautiful result. Itead the above paragraph several times. Be sure you grasp its import. Just now you may not feel you can give the statement your unqualified assent. You are not asked to do so. But it is important fbr you to be sure you have comprehended the import of the words. Full dernonstration of their truth will come later. As practice perfbcts you in demonstration and in keeping distinct the activities of your conscious and subr:onscious minds, as shown in Key 6, you will begin to notice that evelything you think and say and do is connected with the movement of cycles of energy extencling far beyond yollr present field of being. lf you have some knowledge of astrology, you will observe a regular ebb and flow of mental activity corresponding exactly to the transits of the moon and planets through your horoscope.

As yott come more and more to interpret your personal activities as being expressions of the One Will which directs the universe, you will see also that in a sense you are always at the spiritual center of the whole system of cosmic cycles. You will begin to understand that your personal existence is a continual dissolution of outworn forms to make room for the untbldment of new and better ones. (Keys 7, 10, 13) At first it may not be easy to maintain the mental attitude we have described, but persist in it. Remind yourself repeatedly of the real facts no matter what appearances may be. In time you will transfer the idea to subconsciousness which will begin to act upon it. Then there will begin to grow in you a feeling that the most vital parl of you remains unmoved through all the transfbrmations of external circumstances, as unmoved as the sphinx at the top of the Wheel of Fortune. More and more you will feel that all details of your personal life are adequately supported by the cosmic process. (Keys 8, 10, I 2) The u,ord \"Self'will change in meaning as you grow in understanding. It will come to represent to you the One Identity which finds expression through countless personalities. This Self is the true spiritual center of the universe and at the same time the central reality of your life. Your perception that It is constantly adjusting and balancing the various forces at work within and around you will be reinforced by def-rnite proofs. (Keys 9, 10, t 1) These changes begin at the conscious level with acts of discrimination. They consist of repeated reminders that the personality is a vehicle fbr a cosmic energy which is spiritual. Eventually these repetitions of correct ideas will establish a new type of response at the subconscious level. Ultimately these new responses will bring all the subhuman fbrces of subconsciousness into harmony with the conscious thouglrt. (I(eys 6,7 , B) It is almost wholly a question of willing surrender of one's whole personal existence to the direction of the Life-power. This surrender is expressed in utter willingness to let go everything which is no longer of advantage to the progress of the Great Work in one's life, It is the acceptance ofguidance from above, based on reasoned conviction that such suidance is always available.
