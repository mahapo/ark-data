[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION Lesson Six Before reading this lesson, review the lessons dealing with Keys 20,13 and 6 in TAROT FUNDAMENTALS, and with the letters Shin, Nun andZain. Let a little time elapse between this review and the study of the lesson now in your hands. Then you will get a great deal more out of what follows. In the T'arot Key representing the fifth stage of spiritual unfoldment, personality was depicted by two small children dancing in a fairy ring. In I(ey 20, the two children are merged into one who now has the father and mother on either side. The child has its back to the spectator, so that the sex is indeterminate, though it seems to be a boy. The child is the new concept of personality, born ofsubconsciousness, yet fathered by conscious knowledge and reasoning. One of the secrets of Key 20 is that the child's father and mother are lifted up because the child is rising. We see here the stage of unfoldment immediately preceding cosmic consciousness. The scene has some features of the physical plane, but closer examination shows that it must be referred io tlre iiietapliysical i'ealiii. Tlie figui-es. though iiude, aie iroi flesh-color. but gi'ay. Tiie light that shines here \"never shone on land or sea.\" Mountains rise in the distance, but they are mountains of ice. The whole suggestion is that this is the fluidic region beyond the range of physical sensation. This is confirmed by the position of the human figures. In this picture they rise from rectangular colfins. The same general suggestion is given in older versions of I(ey 20. By tireir shape, the coffins represent the limitations of three-dimensional consciousness. In symbolism, the part is often put for the whole . . . in this instance for a whole impossible to show in a picture. The figures stand at right angles to the coffins. This reminds us that the fourth dimension is at right angles to all the dimensions we know. Therefore the meaning of this detail of the design is that the regenerated personality and its parents, self-consciollsness and subconsciousness, are now liberated from the limitations of three-dimensional consciousness. They have been set free by a trumpet-blast, sounded by an angel whose flaming wings signi$t that he personif,tes the element of fire, attributed by Qabalists to the letter Shin. This angel is not some celestial being come down to earth . . . no visitor from the skies. His trumpet-call comes from the Great Within. This whole scene is a representation of interior metaphysical experience. 11,10300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7'tl ROT I N T E RP RETATION. On the physical plane, sensation is stimulated by radiant energy, fluids, gases and solids. These are the fire, water, air and earth of the old physics, symbolized by the wand, cup, sword and pentacle on the Magician's table. Besides these four, Western occultism, especially in alcherny, recognizes a fifth, termed tlie Quintessence. Liberation is the result of tlie unfoldrnent of the potencies of the cosmic fire within us. In I(ey 20, the symbolism olearly indicates that sound is the special form assumed by the liberating agency. 'Iake this in no figurative or allegorical sense. Sound vibration is what actually sets us free. This is why the tradition of a \"Lost Word\" whose pronunciation is a key to magical powers is mentioned again and again in Western occultism. This is why, in Egyptian rituals, the candidate is repeatedly challenged and cannot pass until he has pronounced the challenger's correct name. To this day, without knowing what it really mealls, we say the great name Amen (lhN) at the end of prayers; and those of us who have some knowledge of Hinduism are familiar with the importance of the mystic syllable, AUM. A practical occultist makes daily use of sound vibration. Even if he has never heard of the greater mysteries of sound, the merest tyro who repeats an affirmation is using this power, whether he utters the words of the affirmation aloud, or merely recites them mentally. In the Orient, the dominant idea of a brief sentence is expressed in a sequence of tones related to that idea, and this Oriental science of the correlation of sound and thought is known as mantra yogs. 'fhe same science is employed for healing by the Western School. In i(ey 20, however, the stress is upon the Soundless Sound, sometimes called the Voice of the Silence. This calls us higher, out of the mortality of persons born from certain parents, into the parentless state. This is the state which is \"after the order of Melchizedek.\" According to the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (see Hebrews 7), Melchizedek was \"without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of lil'e; but made like unto a Son of God; abiding a priest continually.\" (lncidentally, the words, \"after the order of Melchizedek,\" which occur in one of the Psalms and also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, are by no means a reference to a secret order of priesthood on the \"higher planes.\" The Hebrew and Greek words \"after the order of' when translated, really mean \"like unto, similar to, having like properties or qualities.\" Often some pseudo-occultist tells his followers wondrous tales about the supposed \"Order of Melchizedek.\" There have appeared many \"Heads\" or \"Messengers\" of the \"only genuine Order of Melchizedek,\" with tales of high initiation in caves, in remote mountain retreats, in all manner of Arabian Nights' surroundings. Yet the whole nonsensical structure of false pretense tests on the ignoranoe of pretenders and believers alike, who do not know what the word \"order,\" in this particular connection, really means.) When one hears the Inner Voice, through the activity of the \"parentless,\" subtle, metaphysical sound vibration, one is fi'eed fiom all sense of being a mortal and having earthly parents ancl genealogy. One then knows that the I AM really is . . . the timeless, eternal, immortal SELF, Lls0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION: having neither beginning nor end. Thus, in this sixth stage of spiritual unfoldment, one is consciously aware that one was never born and will never die. T'he agency in this work is symbolized by Key 13 which has to do with the fiery Mars force. Key 20 also represents the element of fire because the latter corresponds to the letter Shin. Link this up with I(ey 16 which is attributed to Mars. Liberation has an aspect of destruction. Hindus indicate this when they say that Shiva, the destroyer, is the great Lord of Yoga. Every change in consciousness tears down cells. Human lif'e is an invisible conflasration. Thus the first character of the word Shin (|tllJ) is D, which means tooth. As the office of teeth is to break down the structure of the food we eat so that solar energy may be released by fttrther processes of digestion and assimilation, so, in higher aspects of unfoldment, the fiery Lifb-breath breaks down cells in our bodies. The liberation of the fiery essences of these cells is what makes us aware of states of consciousness beyond thought. Long before this may occllr, however, the Mars fbrce must burn up cells which obstruct the free flow of the Life-power through certain bodily channels. flonsider one specific instance. The spinal cord is a tube. In young children it is open at the lower end so that the serpent power coiled in the sacral plexus can rise through it. This is why little chilclren often have metaphysical vision, and why they sometimes have invisible playmates, both human and animal. As they grow older, this tube is closed at the lower end in orcier that the greatly increased activity of the Viars force, at the time of puberty, may not make the serpent power rise prematurely and injure the brain, as it sometimes does in adtllescent dementia. This is a rvise provision of nailtre, but when a practical occultist seeks to gain metaphysical vision, he must apply the Mars force to destroy the cells which close the lower end of the spinal tube. By opening it again, he really becomes \"as a little child.\" Knowledge of tlris fact has led foolish experimenters into disastrous attempts to open the spinal tube by concentrating on the center at its base. Persons who have grasped the truth that all this work is done, not by personality, but by the Life-power itself, will not make this mistake. Strive to understand that the awakening of the higher vision is according to law and involves a physiological change. On your head be it, if you begin to concentrate on the centers in order to hasten unfoldment. No student knows enough to attempt anything of the kind, except under the guidance of a truly competent teacher who is really clairvoyant. Even such a teacher will usually give instruction in the safe methods of meditation which lead to the same result without subjecting the student to the grave risks attending direct concentration. The three letters, I t U, will reveal to a Qabalist the main factors at work in the sixth stage of spiritual unfoldment. Shin (lt) stands for cosmic fire. Yod (t) represents the working of that fire in what alchemists call \"the black dragon of putrefaction,\" that is, the intestinal tract, governed by the zodracal sign Virgo, attributed to Yod. The final Nun (l) is the symbol of that us0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ttl RO7' I N'f E RP R ETAT'l O N: fire after it has been extracted flom fbod, water and air by various assimilative processes, and, having been converted into nerve-force, is stored up in the Mars center ruling the region corresponding to the sign Scorpio. The nerve-force in the Mars center is raised until it energizes a center in the brain. Then we emerge fiom the world of sense and three dimensions into the supersensual world known as the fourth dimension. None ever does this work for himself. It is done by the SELF working within him. To be sure, the student employs mental and physical exercises; but even these are not his own doing as he soon finds out when he becomes in some measure proficient. The object of all such practices is, or should be, to deepen one's understanding of the truth that no human personality ever does anything of itself. The object of all training is to get the inadequate personality out of the way so that the true SELF, which knowsiust what, how, and when to do it, may find no resistance to the free expression of its perfect mastery of rnind and body. In the beginning, the student seems to hirnself to be getting out of the way. l,ater on, he finds that not even this is his \"own\" action. It is the ansel who sets us free. not we ourselves. We have rnentioned the fact that the bodies of the human f-rgures are gray, and if you have revier,ved our analysis of the symbols, you will remember that the man is maintaining a passive posture, while the woman is actively holding up her hands to receive an influx of power liom above. At this sixth stage of spirittral unfoldment, there begins to be manifest the peculiarity of the consciousness beyond the level of intellectual thought, a peculiarity for which we have no adequate words. It is a reversal of the usual relations of consciousness and subconsciousness, so that self-consciousness, hitherto apparently active, becomes quiet. Observe, too, that in contrast to Key 6, where the man looks at the woman, and in contrast to l(ey 1, where the Magician looks clorvn, this man looks up, and his gaze is fixed on the angel. ln the sixth stage of spiritual unfoldrnent, self-consciousness persists; but it is no longer the dominant element. If anything, subconsciousness now appears to be the more active member of the personal mental pair. On the other hand, while self-consciousness is quite still, since it has realized that personality does nothing of itself, this denial is not by any means the extinction of personality. It is a different evaluation of the meaning of self-consciousness. Nor is this state merely an intellectual conviction or conclusion. lt is a vivid experience. At this stage of unfoldment, the last enemy, death, is overcome, because the experience itself is a transmutation of the very folce which destroys our physical bodies. It is an actual Iiberation of the higher vehicles of consciousness fiom their bondage to the physical plane. This liberation is effected by the decay and destruction of the physical organism. This liberation is even more than this, but at this point in our work, it is not wise to enter into details. It is enough to say that in the sixth stage of unfoldment, what is raised is an incorruptible body which, as St. Paul tells us, is \"sown corruptible.\" The secret of this sowing and reaping is shown in the symbolism of Key 1 3. 11,10300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":",I'A IIO T I N T E R P tI ETA T I O N The process which leads to this result is hinted at in THE EMERALD TABLET: \"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtle fiom the gross, suavely, and with great ingenuity. It ascends from earth to heaven, and descends to earth again, and receives the power of the superiors and of the inferiors.\" The principle involved is a gentle, gradual and careful separation of the finer vehicles of the Life-power from the grosser ones. This operation is performed, as alchemists put it, by the aid of Mercury, which is the planetary ruler of Gemini, the zodiacal sign symbolized by I(ey 6. The separation is an act of discrimination. The whole work of separating the subtle fiom the gross, of extricating the finer vehicles of fbur-dimensional consciousness from their bonds of flesh, calls fbr the application of the principle explained in our analysis of Key 6, in TAROT FTINDAMENTALS. The result of right disclimination is mental equilibrium. Until this equilibrium is established, tliere is continual friction between self-consciousness and subconsciousness, so that the very law of suggestion, which brings about so many seeming miracles when it is constructively applied, acts negatively to intensify our inner disharmony. When we grasp our true relation to the Life-power; when we understand that unfailing wisdorn finds expression, however inadequate, through all our thoughts and words; when we begin to rest our lives upon the fbunciaiion of Eternai Being, our perceprions of these truths, and our endeavors to live them, begin to affect the structure of all our vehicles. For subconsciousness eagerly accepts the implicits of these perceptions and conceptions and begins to act upon them. It then becomes, as shown in Keys 6 and 20,the immediate recipient of the all-wise direction of the Life-power. The personal consciousness (the man) becomes a passive observer of daily experience. This does not mean that subconsciousness is the superior of the two mocles of personal consciousness. No error is more productive of unfortunate results than the one which leacis to dependence on subconsciousness for guidance. We are to recognize that its highest offlce is to serve as a channel for guidance; but the guidance itself comes always from superconsciousness. When this truth is understood and lived, we are actually reborn. The story of the virgin birth, told in many versions of the ancient mysteries, is re-enacted in us. The little child, regenerated personality, conceived by the FIoly Spirit (Ruach Elohim), is born of the liberated wolnan, because the direct action of the Life-power on subconsciousness builds uD a new conception of-personality within us. Mclre than this, the \"seed of the woman,\" as we read in the Bible prophecy, now crushes the serpent's head by overcoming the illusion of separateness and with that illusion, the lie of deatlr. The new man is the little child of I(ey 20, and, in this sixth stage of unfoldment, it is he who, through his ability to enter four-dimensional consciousness, does truly lead personal sell'-consciousness into a new world. us0300"}]
