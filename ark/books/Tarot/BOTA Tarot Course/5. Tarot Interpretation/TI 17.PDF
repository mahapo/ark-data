Then look at them with pencil and paper at hand, so that you rnay make immediate note of anything that may be suggested to you. You never can tell when you will tune in on the thought of somebody who knows a great deal more about Tarot than you do. After awhile, if you persevere, you should find yourself getting this mental radio from members of the Inner School. More and more often your best knowledge of Tarot will come to you this way. The secrets are never printed in books or lessons. They are communicated direotly to persons having sufficient leceptivity. The simplicity of the methods whereby one becomes receptive deceives many and keeps them fiom persistent practice. Pencil and paper, or some other adequate means of keeping a record, are absolutely necessary, The impression made by some of these brain-waves is often fleeting as a dream and passes beyond recall unless one captures it the moment it comes. 7 8 I 10 11 t2 13 t4 15 t0 15 8 9 l1 13 t4 7 12"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TA RO7' I N T E RP IlETA T I O N l7 Quite as valuable as the content of these fragments of illumination which you are sure to receive, if you make due preparation for them, is the verification this practice will give you as to the actual existence of the lnner School. It won't be long before you will accumulate plenty of eviclence that the source of these flashes of enlightenment is by no means within your personality, conscious or subconscious. There is a difference between one's own thought and what is received telepathically . . . distinct as the difference between the sound of one's own voice and that of another person. Al1er you have begun to receive these mental radiograms, it will be evident also that they come fiom diffbrent types of mentality which may easily be distinguished, one from another. By no means every reader of these pages will enjoy this contact with the Inner School. Experience has shown that no matter how we insist on the importance of fbllowing strictly the simple directions for using Tarot, it is the exceptional student who does exactly what he is told. Many students fail to realize that these instructions are by no tneans one man's opinions, but are, instead, the concentrated essence of research and experimentation which have been carriecl on for centuries. A good many persons seem to feel that while there may be something interesting and valuable in these lessons, they know better about Tarot and what to do with it than we do. We seek to coerce no person's belief or actions, but it may do some good to say once more that these pages do not contain our personal views, particularly about methods and practice. We zue simply transmitting to you sornething we have received and which we have tested carefully. We know that it will work if you work it. In the first group of three Keys to be considered in this week's tabieau, notice first the Warrior (7) and then the Adversary (15), with Justice (1 1) between them. Observe that the Warrior is not fighting and that the sphinxes of his car are at rest. In explaining the symbolism of l(ey 15, we have somewhere pointed out that the chains arouncl the necks of the two figures at the bottom of the picture would not hold them a moment if only they knew enough to lift the loops over their heads. And in connection with tire satne Key yor-r have been reminded again and again that nowhere in the universe is there really anything like the Devil. There are no problems for your true Self, the Warrior in the chariot, nor is there any Adversary. The symbol of Justice, where the scales are perfectly balanced, shows the reason for what we have just said. Since the forces of the universe are always in perfect equilibrium, there is really no antagonism anywhere except in appearance, as man misjudges appearance. Wise men see this. Others try to reform the world. In the next group of three (8, 11, 14), the meaning of Key 8 may be taken as a reference to this sentence of The Emerald Tablet: \"This is the strong force of all fbrces, overcoming every subtle, ancl penetrating every solid thing.\" That very force is now at work bringing about the realization of your heart's desire. Never mind any appearance to the contrary. Lts'0 300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRE'TATION., ]7 One reason you are studying these lessons is that you have reached the point in your spiritual development where you are about to be released from the hypnotic spell cast by appearances. The force at work through you is adequate to overcome the sr-rbtlest of your seeming aciversaries and penetrating enough to reach you through every apparent obstacle. You are nearing the time when you will see that this force is being employed right now to make precisely those fine adiustments which are required in order to bring you to your true goal in lif'e. Befbre long you should begin to understand that your whole life story is really a mental conception of the Author of All. Then it will be evident that what you have hitherto supposed to be something you wanted for yourself is really something the Life-power wants for you and is working through you to bring into actual, tangible manifestation. Ageless Wisdom is explicit in declaring the whole universe to be an expression of Conscious llnergy. it follows that the Orie Intelligence sees the whole of its manifestation and every detail thereof. 'Iime does not bind it as we are bound, so lor-rg as we remain limited by the sense of suocession which is characteristic of the intellectual level of our self-consciousness. As Abbe Dimnet says, in WHAT WE LIVE BY: \"Pure Spirit, God, all the time sees the whole picture of which we see only fragments. The tlniverse, even the endless succession of universes which astronomy has sometimes inferred fror-n the conservation of energy, is present to Him as our consciousness of ourselves is pfcsent to r-is.\" Arnong the details of this picture which must always be prcsent to the Cosmic Intelligence are inchrded the thoughts and desires of every human being. 'l'he power of that One Identity is all the power there is and the whole of that power is always related to the particular manifestations which constitute your personality. Thus your personal life is an aspect of the perpetual process of the Life-power's self-adjustment. In the course of that adjustment there is a continual dissolution of forms, a continuous series of structural disintegrations, but this eternal transition from one form to another expresses a power which itself suffers no change in essence. No form or condition, therefore, has power to arrest your progress because the real YOU is essentially identical with the One Reality. (Keys 9, 11, 13) Manif'estation is often pictured as a system of wheels. We find this image in Ezekiel. It is given in the Bhagavad-Gita and is repeated again and again in the texts of Buddhism. \"Wreels within wheels,\" Ezekiel says, intimating an intricate comelation of cycles like that which is suggested by the symbolism of I(ey 10. He also takes care to convey the idea that this system is not mere mechanism, for he says \"the wheels were full of eyes.\" The Great Rota is an intelligent expression of life and this idea of Ezekiel's is shared by other seers who use the wheel symbol in their writings and diagrams. us0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T'AROT' INTEllP]tETA7'ION. 1 7 In the midst of all the whirling, moreover, there is balance. Every degree that the wheel turns upward on one side is compensated by an equal degree of descent on the other. At the center there is absolute stillness. Thr-rs he who hnds within himself the CENTER, the abode of pure Spirit, is fi'eed fi'om all necessity for action which is brought to an end for him, and he becomes like a pendulum which has ceased its rnotion. Thus it is forever tme that the wise man tlrinketh, \"I am doing nothing.\" (Keys I0, n,12) T'he praotical application of Tarot is intended to eff-ect a change in the student's interpretation of the meaning of experience. .Iust as astronomy has corected our notions of the movements of the heavenly bodies, reversing beliefs formerly held by all mankind, so does Ageless Wisdom cortect our opiniotr of the nature of our personal activities. The uninitiated regard personal action as being self-originated. The wise think of it as being simply the localized expression of universal fbrces flowing into and through the field of personality, like the river pictured in Key 7. Most persons look upon the forces surrounding them as being alien and dangerous, like the lion in i(ey 8. Those who have been properly taught understand that we continually exert control over all these fbrces which respond automatically to our conscious attitudes. This happens eveu when we apply that control so as to bring us painful (and therefore educative) experiences. Most people look on the goal of attainment as being something afbr off, in the futrue. and bound up with environmental conditions. The instructed few see that the true goal is a clear rcalization of the One Idcntity which, even now, is closer at hand than anything else. This is all that anyone ever hopes to be, has all that anyone ever hopes to have, and does all that anyone ever hopes to do. (Keys 7 ,8,9) Included in the complete reversal of interpretation which results from esoteric training is freedom liom the fear of death. This training also fi'ees us from our repugnance to physical dissolution. We come to understand the necessity and cosmic wisdom for these changes of forms whicl-r is really all they are. The student gains a higher vantage point from which he clearly sees that his personality will survive the death of his physical body. Yes, even that his persor-rality is independent of his physical body right now! fhis is real knowledge gained by experiment and subjected to tests as searching as those applied to any other type of scientific investigation. In the course of the experiments many clifficult problems are met and solved, one by one. Consequently the conviction grows in the mind of the student that whenever the forces of the universe present him a forbidding and adverse appearance, it is because he has not yet learned the true meaning of that appearance; not because there is anywhere in the universe a power inherently inimical to hirnself and his welfare.

These I(eys are a symbolic summary of the understanding of Those Who Know. By looking daily at thcse pictures you impress your subconsciousness with a condensed statement of the attitude toward lifb and its problems which enables adepts to perform their mighty works. An adept is not a person who has acquired unusual power. He is a person who has achieved an unusual point-of-view. The masses accept the universe at its face value. An adept discems what is really the true state of things. [-lse Tarot as these lessons are teaching you how to use it, and you will saturate your subconsciousness with tlie wisdom of the Inner Circle of Those Who Know. Your subconsciousness will respond automatically to this treatment. First it will make you see things diff'erently and produce a change in your interpretations and in your emotional attitudes. Ultimately it will build you a new kind of organism through which the forces of the universe may be expressed in worhs of power. MEDITATIONS FIRST DAY: Keys 7, 1 1, 15. My real Self has no problems. My faith is steadfast in this conviction. The rnask of the Adversary hides the face of my Beloved. I have nothing to fight, firr perf'ect adiustment even lto\\v overcomes everv seen-ring eviJ. SECOND DAY: I(eys 8, 11 , 74. The strong force of all forces is at worh in me. It cuts every knot of difficulty. It is the free power of my true Self. I am filled with power, adequate to my every need, and I face this day as an opportunity to prove the truth on which my faith is founded. TFIIRD DAY: I(eys 9, 1 1 , 13. Pure Spirit, my true Self, sees everything as it is. It remains poised in the midst of action. It dissolves every limitation which might retard my eternal progress. My life is in the Hand of the Eternal and its perfect Justice looses all my bonds. FOURTI-I DAY: I(eys 10, 11,12. The Center of the cosmic whirlings is also the Center of my personal existence. That Center is in perfect equilibrium. I am at rest as I rest in it. The wheel of manifestation has stillness at its center and that stillness is in my heart of hearts. F'll'-TI{ DAY: I(eys 7, 8, 9. Ageless Wisdom corrects all my false notions about the rneaning of my lif'e. I live by the power of the whole universe. My goal is knowledge of the One Identity. My true Self masters all the forces of nature now, and stands alone and unmoved in tl-re midst of all appearances of struggle and effort. SIXTHDAY: I(eys 13,14,I5. Deathisthenamegivenbyignorancetochangeir-rfbrm. I am in the midst of an experiment which releases me from that ignorance. The problems I face are bnt veils for the one beautiful Tmth.
