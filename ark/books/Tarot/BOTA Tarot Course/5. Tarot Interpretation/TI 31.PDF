[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION Lesson Thirtv-one 'l'he twenty-two Tarot Keys may be combined to form 112 groups of nine Keys, each group containing nine cards, numbered consecutively. This does not include the various \"magic\" arrangements, such as we have been using in this course. The l{eys in every group follow a certain natural order. The 112 combinations fall into eight classes. Inspection of the tables will show that in each set of fourteen groups, the first arrangement of nine I(ey sets the pattern for all other groups of that class. No two arrangements are the sarne. Every one conveys its own distinct shade of meaning.

Set up one tableau of nine Keys for your morning meditation, and the next one just before going to bed. Try to write out, from these tableaus, groups of meditations similar to those you have received in this course. Not until you have tried this for yourself will you discover how true it is that Tarot evokes what is in our minds, rather than putting something into them. Ilere is one of the features of this course. Do not let the uninteresting appearance of the tables keep you from making full use of them. Wren you write your meditations, use the first suggestion which come to you as you look at a given Key. Sometimes it will be a bit of the symbolism which will start your train of thought. At other times, the Hebrew letter, or some of its attributions, will be what provokes a response. If you have worked faithfully with the Cube of Space in TAROT FTINDAMENTALS, that will bring much to you. You will never exhaust the possibilities of Tarot. Remember, there are no less than 1,724,727 ,777 ,607 ,680,000 different ways in which the entire series of major trumps may be laicl out, using all twenty-two Keys each time. To reckon the other possibilities of group combination is almost beyond human calculation. No two combinations mean precisely the same. Now, just as Tarot is as vast as the cosmos in its combinations, so are there innumerable ways to use it. Up to now, the emphasis has been on yourself. In these first four courses, our aim has been to put you in possession of the fundamental knowledge requisite for you to practice intelligent sel f-direction. Yet the wisdom of Tarot has to do also with the art of directing the great cosmic forces which surround you and which are playing through you. Again, Tarot has to do with the relationships existing between your personality and other human units constituting the social order in which you live. us0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":",I'ARO7' INT'ERPREI'ATION: 3] Before one may hope to understand others, he must know himself. Before one may serve or direct others, he must have established some degree of self-command. Hitherto, your work with Tarot has been planned to prepare you for wider responsibilities. The time approaches when you must assume some of these, as part of your further occult training. If you have worked persistently and faithfully with the material which we have put into your hands, you have become a personality very different from the one who opened the first lesson ofSEVEN STEPS. New vistas have shown themselves to you. Ideas which may have been difficult at first are now easier to grasp. Changes have been made in your mentality, and transformations have been effected in the chemistry of your body. You are now ready to render a wider service to humanity and to yourself. Hitherto you have been an Associate. After the next lesson you will be promoted to the status of a Corresponding Probationer of the Builders of the Adytum. As such you will have access to instructions which were reseryed for strictly obligated aspirants until recent times. You will find that your promotion makes a decided difference in a number of ways. By writing out and signing the Statement of Dedication which you will receive in the next lesson, you will make a closer contact with the inner powers behind the outer organization of B.O.T.A. 'ihis living oontact you wili find heipful and usefui in many ways. Behind the external form of our organization is a living spirit which is a mighty source of power for those who are linked with it. As a dedicated Corresponding Probationer, you will be in a position to receive manifestations of this power such as could not be experienced by persons unprepared for them. Through the work you have already accomplished, you have made a definite change in your status. From now on, as you demonstrate your abilities, you will be given opportunities for further advancement. In the next, and last, lesson of this series, you will be given some additional instruction in the concrete application of Tarot to living the awalcened life. There, too, you will find an outline of the extremely useful and interesting studies which will follow this course."}]
