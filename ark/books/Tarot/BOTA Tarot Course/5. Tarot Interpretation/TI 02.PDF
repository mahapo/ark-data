Begin by reviewing the six lessons in Tarot Fundamentals dealing with these three Keys. Then read this lesson, to get the general idea of the second step in spiritual unfoldment. After this reading comes the nrost important part of vour work. The Lifb-power has a special message for you and you must make your mind receptive to this instruction lrom the One 'feacher within. Because you cannot expect to do this in a day, you should make goocl use of yoru occult diary. Take a little time every day to listen to the lnner Voice and make note of evcry irnpression you receive. Sct apart a f-ew nrinutes every clay for this. It makes little difference what time you select, so long as it is not too soon after a meal. Choose a time you can keep daily, without being disturbed. Take two or tluee good, deep breaths. Then forrnulate a question rvhich concerns the stage ol' unfbiciment you are studying. Bxpect to recerve an answer. Srt quret and iisten. You may seem actually to hear a voice. Or the answer may seem to rise in your mind as a thought. Possibly a symbolic vision may come. Whatever the form taken by the answer, after a I'ew trials it will come during this time of quiet listening. Write it down. If you hear what seems to be an inner voice, record its message. If you see a vision,clescribeitaccurately. lfideasrisetothesurfaceofyourconsciousnc'ss,setthem dou,n. At first the response may be indefinite. Perhaps there may be only sorne slight stirring of your emotions, some sort of feeling abor:t the question you have put. If so, describe the feeling. Different temperaments react to this practice in various wa)'s. Be sure the writing follows meditation ancl that it sirnply records the response which comes from within after you asl< a deflnite question. This is not automatio writing. You are not to sit passive, waiting for anything that may occrr to yon. You make yourself receptive to a particular kind of infbrmation. You know the omniscient Life-power understands every detail of the subiect abont which you have inquired and is therefore able to answer your qnestion. Your part is to provide corrditions sLritable lor bringing the answer into the field of self-conscious awareness."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7..1]IO1' I NT E RP RIi]'A TI O N: Tr,vo months liom now, read over whatever has come to you within the next few days alter you study this lesson. Then study the High Priestess, the Hermit and the Tower once more. You will discover things you do not see now, and you will be able to add to your notes. By that time you may fbel tliat some pafts of yotr first notes need modification or recasting. lt is inevitable, as you ripen in consciousness, that you should find bettcr and clearer ways to express the trrith which is within you. Thtts, ther'e will never come a time when you cannot improve your work somewhere, nor a time when you will know all there is to know. Never will you be denied the.joy of making fi'esh discoveries, the happiness of finding new beauties in this wisdom teaching. The riper you become, the more will you know and the better will you be able to express what you know. Yet you shonld not begin your work with any tinge of feeling that these first steps are not important. Wrat you get now, just as it cornes, is u,hat is best for your present stage of clevelopment. The sccond stage of spiritual unfoldment has for its active principle the phase of universal consciousness represented bi' the High Priestess. This we have identified with what is variously labelled by modern psychology as subconscious, subliminal, or subjective mind. It lras been called also transliminal consciousness, and there is much in favor of this term. 'I'ransliminal means \"across the threshold\" and in some respects this seems to be a more accurate descriptior-r of the consciousness syrnbolrzeclby the High Priestess. lior ouc thing. it conveys uo itnpt'ession of infbriority,', as do the rvords subconscious and sulrlinrinal. This mode of consciousness is what Flindu philosophy calls Prukriti. The u'ise men of tlre Liast say that Prakrili (subconsciousness) and Purusltc (self-consciousness) are coequal and coeternal. Through tlansliminal consciousness we can read the records of past expressions of the Lif'e-porver. Psychologists have found that subconsciousness has perfect memory. Nothing you ever experienced has been forgotten. Many years ago, experiments conducted in France by Colonel De Rochas, succeecled in tapping subconscious memories of previous incarnations. Uncler hypnosis, recollection has been carried back to birth, and then, told to go back larther still, the subject has related experiences of a person who Iived several generations earlier and the accounts so given liave been verified by ancient recorcls. Objection has been macle that the result of such expedments is tainted by the operator's sr:ggesticxr, and that consequently thele is no proof that the subiect recalls his own former existence. Yet the investigators have flound old archives in churches and town-halls, showing that at the time mentioned by the subject, persons having the names he gives did actually live and that at the same time events occurred such as he remembers.

Certainly we all carry with us a perfect record of whatever we have experienced in this incarnation. And one may leam whatever he needs to knorv concerning previous physical expressions of the particular tendencies of the Life-power rvhich are now unfblding through his personality. We oft'er no argument for the doctrine of reincarnation. Argument settles nothing whatever. Ob.jections come from persons rvho are wanting in a certain kind of'experience. We choose words carefully when we say we hnow that the particular complex of activities now projected through the personality of the writer of these iessons is a continuation of activities which, at otlrer times and places, rvere projected into pliysical existence as other persons, whose lives were occupied with circumstances and responsibilities quite different. We say we know, because we remember those other persons, with as vivid a recollection of emotional and intellectual experience as that which enables Lrs to identify this present \"Paul Foster Case\" with a youngster of ten, whose reputation for deviltry was emphasized by his fetther's prominence in the affairs of the local Congregational chnrch. Paul Case remembers being that boy. In exactly the same way, he also remembers being a Rabbi who wrote a Qabalistic cotnntentary on Genesis. For him, one memory is just as valid as the other. The scroll of the High Priestess symbolizes this cosmic memory, to which we all have access. I(eep in mind the fact that the two aspects of the personal expression of the Lifb-power (Purusha and Prakriti, self'-conscious and subconscions, Magician and High Priestess) are coexistent. The Life+ower is both. It is the superconscious nnitv of which these two are the poles. Wherever the Life-power is present the two poles are plesent and they are present in their entirety. What seetn to us to be personal manif-estations of self-consciousness or of subconsciollsness are really expressions of the Lif-e-power in self-conscious or subconscions modes. Logical necessities of the process whereby the Life-power manifests itself, result in the illusion of personal separateness; br-rt when reason has taken us this far, we may go on to make experiments rvhich fi'ee us forever from the delusions resulting from uncritical acceptance of the illusion. We have continually to remincl ourselves that we are not really separate beings, until we establish subconscious recognition of our essential unity with the Life-porver. Carelul observation of nature, using the ob.iective concentration represented by I(ey I , will ettable us to discover the essential unity of Being behind the veils of manifold appearanse. This discovery has to be transferred from self--consciousness to subconsciousness. We make the discovery by watching closely what occurs in the plane of existence we perceive by means r ts?300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T/lRO INTERPRI'7 AI ION. ol'our senses. Frorn this plane we get facts, whicli we use in the process of inductive reasoning. At this point in our r,rnfbldment we do not experience the unity of Being as we shall know it when we becorne riper. We perceive it intellectually as a premise or hypothesis. This we turn over to subconscioLlsness. [t is the seed the Magician plants in his garden. In considering the tirst stage of unfoldment we saw that subconsciousness is always amenable to suggestion and that it controls all vital functions. It is the mistress of the body-building process. lt determines cell-structure, When subconsciousness is impressed with the idea of the r\"rnity of Being, every cell of the trillions in the body is modified by that impression. The suggestion accepted by subconsciousness tinges the consciollsness ofall the cells. From the moment self-consciousness impresses subconsciousness with the premise of non-separateness, the mental state of the whole cell community begins to be changed. Some of the cells do not adapt themselves easily to the new conception of personality. They die, and are elinrinated lrom the body. Their places are taken by new cells, new \"wine-sldns\" to hold the \"wine\" of the new idea. 'fhLrs a gradural change in body structure is effected. until a moment arrives when there is a sulficient number of new cells to rnake possible a flash of personal realization of the truth. Weci<s and months, perhaps years may pass while these imperceptible changes in cell structure are being accomplished. The person in r,r'hose body these changes occur has no inkling of what goes on; but ail at once comes a flash of direct perception which seems to upset his whole house of 1ife. Tliis sudden, catastrophic glin-rpse of reality is pictured by I(ey 16. Sottretitnes this vivid experience ternporarily paralyzes one or more of the person's faculties. One may be struck dumb by it. Another, lihe St. Paul, may go blind. Even when the physical eff'ects are not so marked, there is a forcible tearing apart of the structure of personal cousciousness, so that he who is passing through this experience rnay Ibar for his sanity. Sr-rdden as it is, tl-ris experience is the cuhnination o1'an orderly series of mental and physical changes, .iust as a thunderstorm is the culn'iination of a gradual accumulation of electrical energy. It does not come until one is prepared to stand the shock. It destroys fbrever the delusion of separateness, just as a lightning flash gives a traveler a momentary but clear picture of the road he is on and destroys whatever false notions he may have fbrmed of it while stumbling along in the dark. The darkness may close in again and as time passcs, soille details of the vision may grow dirn; but the f'lash of realization cannot be fbrgotten and the memory of it will spur the traveler. It will give him courage to pursue his iournev to its encl.

This experience is at once arcalizatton that the I AM, by reason of its own nature, is even now the conqueror of every limitation and it is also a flaslr of intuition which gives one a glirnpse of the dazzhngglory of the perl'ect expression of the I-imitless Light. The flash of realization is a momentary sharing of the Lif-e-power's perfect Self-Ifuowleclge. It seems to contradict everything in previous experience because all previous experience has been colored by the sense of separateness. The consciousness o1'the Life-power finds expression in the words, \"I am the Lord, and there is none else.\" Prior to having this experience, the human consciousness is, \"I am a poor morlal, surrounded by millions of other mortals who are actual or potential enemies and by natural conditions even more inimical.\" Suddenly to realize that all this is a lie, suddenly to see that one is immortal, suddenly to perceive that all other human beings and all conditions of personal experience are working together to bring about the perfect manifestation of a cosmic plan which in essence is the outworking of the inmost reality of one's being-tliis is a reversal of personal and race consciousness so radical, that fbr a time, it overwhelms us. This experience is not an acquisition. Neither is it a miracle. Because you are a center of expression for the self-conscious aspect of the l-if-e-power's activity, a time anives in the evolutton of this consciousness through your personaiity when the premise of the unity of Being is formulated in your conscions mind. This premise then becomes the starting point for a series of subconsciotts operations that build into your body new cells which are able to give expression to the Lifelou'er' s self-linowled ge. Tlre flash of inspiration therefbre, is a participation in the Life*power's perfect, all-embracing lecollection of itself. For a nroment one remembers who and wlrat he reallv is. Thus the lightning flash of I(ey l6 may be understood to be a ray of light from the Hermit's lantern. When the experience cornes, it seems that we have seen something new. The light seems to corne from above and from afar. In truth, the Light-bearer is close at hand, here with Lrs rlow and always-\"closer than hands or feet.\" We have ernphasized the physiological changes which precede this realization, yet orrly a very careless reader will jump to the conclusion that we are trying to persuade you that this sudden illumination is nothing more than a physical phenomenon. To think so would be a grave error. We consider it best to make the nature of the process as clear as possible, so that you may see it as an orderly manifestation of cosmic law and not as a miracle. Tlie physiological explanation of tliis stage of spilitual unlblclment may be carried much farther, since the occult meanings of the letter Yocl corresponding to I(ey 9 provide some important clues.
