Thus the make-up of Tarot brings home to us the fact that all the activities of our lives are aspects of a fundamental unity. His higher spiritual consciousness enables man to comprehend the Whole. His intellectual consciousness discerns only the parts. The divisions and separations are in his mind, not in the true uature of Reality. No lesson of Ageless Wisdom is more important than this. It serves to correct a whole brood of errors. The rnode of consciousness attributed to Key 8 has a long name: The Intelligence of the Secret of all Spiritual Activities. First of all, it means that there are no unspiritual activities. Everything in your experieuce expresses the power of the Life-Breath. The secret pictured by Key 8 is that the subhuman expressions of this Life-Breath are always subject to control by human subconsciousness. This truth, which these lessons have now made familiar to you, is of paramount importance to every practical occultist. It will enable you to utilize an unlimited supply of energy. It is the secret of power. As a rule the conscious mind learns this truth from a teacher. Very gifted observers learn it by watching the course of nature. Once perceived, this truth becomes a new foundation fbr our i nterpretations of experience. Modern ps5'chology has definitely established still ancther truth r,vhich the Ageloss V/isdom has taught down through the ages----narnely that human subconsciousness is always amenable to control by suggestions originating in the conscious mind. Now read over these two truths again and consider them together, taken in conjunction they make evident the fact that the sub-human levels of the Light-power's activities are wholly subordinate to the conscious mind. T'hus we come to understand why our work must begin with the proper use and control of the conscious mind; why it is basically essential consciously to implant proper and efTective suggestions in subconsciousness; and why the facts of our daily experience must be correctly understood, interpreted, and transmitted to subconsciousness in the form of effective suggestions. This is the right way . . . indeed the only way . . . to reach our goals and aspirations. In this connection consider Key 12 and the perception it symbolizes. Realize that the way to secure results opposite to those we find restrictive and painful is to reverse our conscious attitude toward life. l{ealize also that what rnost people may think of as wrong may be quite the reverse. lndeed those rare persons who astound us by their mastery of nature owe their ability to an exceptional mental attitude. Such persons invariably assure us that they accept the idea us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETITION,. ]8 represented by the Hanged Man. To some extent their statements vary, but the gist of their doctrine is this: \"I have not done these things. They were accomplished by a power higher than myself, working through me.\" The thoughts and actions of these persons are usually misunderstood. They terrify lesser rninds. Often they are considered to be enemies of society. Their ideas and their practices are condemned as offerins a threat to existins institutions. In a sense this is true. If all men lived as these few live, the present state of society would be overthrown. The existing social order (or disorder) is fbunded on fear and the delusion of separateness. It is a system of which the mainspring is organized selfishness. Among human beings released from the bondage of fear, this reign of greed and terror could not continue. Iror it is based on the lie that any man may live for himself alone. (Keys 8, 12, 16) Ageless Wisdom says everything is under the supervision of a beneficent Universal Consciousness. It says the world, and all events therein, express the Will of a single Knower. It counsels us to place our whole dependence on this Will. They who are best versed in the practical methods of Ageless Wisdom astonish their contemporaries by extraordinary command of the forces of nature. They demonstrate their fieedom from bondage to cilcumstances. They agree that their secret is simple. As Jesus put it, they do the will of the Father. A child can grasp this idea and put it into operation. Yet it is too sirnple for persons caught in the web of delusion. Such persons point to the sernblance of evil in the world. They ask how, if there be a beneficent Supervisor over the whole scheme, such conditions (which they term \"grim realities\") can exist. They ignore the fact that those who apply themselves rvholeheartedly to living a life of surrender are invariably happy and healthy, find their every need supplied, and truly enjoy themselves. The critics pooh-pooh the esoteric doctrine that their \"grim realities\" are not realities at all, but are, instead, waking nightmares produced by a sort of hypnosis which affects certain levels of the race-mind. They themselves are victims of this hypnotism, and like persons having a bad dream cannot perceive that it is preposterous from beginning to end. Sooner or later even they will awaken to the truth. Their specious arguments need not disturb us. After all, Ageless Wisdom can cite a long line of conspicuously successful men and women who have said that their secret was the simple one of surrender to the guidance of the One Will. The critics have no such evidence to offer in support of their opinions. They are defeatists. One logical outcome of their influence in the world is the sorry spectacle of our so-called \"civilization.\" ( I(eys 9,72,l5) Grasp, or comprehension, is the root-idea of Key 10.

Then all the forces of the cosmos will be ready to work for you. Many find it hard to realize that our states of body and circumstance do really depend on our comprehension of relationships. The connection is by no means obvious and the natural man prefbrs the obvious, Yet there is a way to get beyond the limitations of the natural man. lt is the way of surrender. Ilence we find the ever*recurring theme of renunciation running through all the books of wisdom. Remember, what is to be renounced is a delusion-the error that any human beins is separate frorr the beneficent order ofthe universe. The hair shirt and flagellations of the early ascetics and the givings-up-and- doings-witl-rout of the modern breed is the reverse of the real meaning of spiritual renunciation. The fullness and joy of life is our birthright. Indeed you are studying these lessons to attain them and all other blessings. Therefore give up and renounce only your delusions of separateness. When practice has made this renunciation a subconscious habit, then one becomes increasingly aware of the guidance of a higher Intelligence. Then the way to the heights of achievement and reahzation is seen to be open and one begins the ascent which leads at last to pcrfbct blending of personal aspiration with the Cosmic Will. (l(eys 10, 12, 14) For such surrender faith is required . . . but not blind faith based on unquestioning acceptance of dogma. it is reasoned faith, growing out of imaginative development of knowledge available to anyone who will master the technique of scrutintzing closely what goes on in his environment and in his inner life. Lack of attention is responsible for our effoneous opinions. We do not see what we look at. Hence we draw false conclusions from our faulty observations. Then these false conclusions become premises which subconsciousness elaborates by deductive reasoning into systems of error and defeat. If we practice concentration, so that we observe accurately, we cannot help reading the message of the book of nature. When we accurately see and cognate what we look at, we store our memories with correct representations of reality. 'i'hen we make correct deductions and the fruit of these is a faith nothing can shake. Out of that faith comes full surrender to the inevitable perf'ection of the cosmic proaess. As a consequence of our surrender, even death loses its terrors, transforms its dreadful oountenance, and at last is overcome completely. (Keys 17,72,13) We cannot too often remind you that subconscious response to rnental attitudes held by self--consciousness is wholly automatic. Subconsciousness is like a garden.

Thus you need never concern yourself with practices designed to overcome subconscious resistance. It is true that time is required to exhaust the consequences of former errors. Correct procedure, however, consists merely in repeating the assumption of correct mental attitudes again and again until new habits have been formed. It is like learning to maintain a proper bodily posture. At first there are many relapses into the old wrong attitudes, but, as time passes and etfort continues, these become less and less. .fire most fruitful thought on which you can dwell is symbolized by the Hermit. It is the thought that you should always reckon as part of your daily life the overshadowing presence of One who knows, understands, and lights the way for your upward progress. Made habitual, this thought works subconsciously to bring you into harmonious adjustment with the sweep of the cycles of cosmic activity. Then you find the wheels within wheels of the Life-power's rnanifestation working together to ripen to fruition the realization of your aspirations. (Keys 8,9, 10) Continual endeavor to purify your theories should be your aim. People are always saying: \"All this sounds so true, so logical, when I hear it at a lecture, or read it in a lesson. But how can I, when I return to the world, make it work?\" First of all, try to keep some part of your consciousness from ever returning to the world. The truth of things is not to be found on their surfaces. Try acting as if these doctrines of Ageless Wisdorn were true. Remember, thought is action. Let yourself be directed by the Angel in I(ey 14. Pause many times daily to remind yourself of this guidance. Nothing is too srnall to turn over to it, nor is anything too great. Tr5z i1, and you will soon find this out for yourself. In the course of every day's activities, all sorts of problems arise. Remind yourself continually that, however terriS'ing they may be, these appearances are due to your ignorance of some factor involved. The ignorance, moreover, is merely personal. Your real Self already knows the right answer. The more you invite its direction, the speedier will come the solution of your difficulties. You will probably have to abandon some opinions long held. It may be necessary tbr you to demolish many a structure of misapprehension. In due course, however, there will be less and less conflict. Keep on exercising yourself in right thinking. Eventually you will reap from your subconscious mentation a rich harvest of constructive realizations.
