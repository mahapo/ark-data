[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION Lesson Twelve TIIE INNER HARMOI\\TY For this week's lesson lay out Keys 2 to l0 as follows: Rule: When the number on a Tarot Key is the mean arithmetical term between the numbers on two others . . . i.e. equidistant from the other two as, for instance, 7 is equidistant fiom 6 and 8 . . . that I(ey is: (1) a link between the other two; (2) a symbol of the point of equilibrium between the forces those other two Keys symbolize; (3) a representation of the channel through which tliose forces act and react upon each other. For example, Key 3 bears a number which is half the sum of 2 and 4. Thus the Empress is the link between the High Priestess and the Emperor. She represents an activity which equilibrates the forces symbolized by those two Keys. She typifies also the channel which transmits the force of the High Priestess to the Emperor and through which the force of the Emperor reacts upon the High Priestess. These forces are your forces. Keep this always in mind. The calm steadiness of the High Priestess is yours whenever you let it find expression. Yours are the fecund potencies symbolized by the rich ferlility of the Empress' garden. Your conscious mind, as the composer and regulator of your personal world, has all the authority and royalty of the Emperor. The Hierophant stands for the real presence in your life of a Wisdom which can guide you aright in every detail of your daily self-expression. The Lovers portray the true relation existing now between your conscious and subconscious minds, overshadowed by the protecting presence of the superconscious. The Chariot depicts what is really true at this moment and always, namely the fact that your personality is a vehicle for the One Power which masters and regulates all the mysterious forces of nature.

The Wheel of Fortune is a symbol of the truth that every phase of your personal activity is a manifestation of the perfectly co-ordinated progress of the cycles of the cosmos. Tarot, you have been told, speaks by evoking thought. It does more, fbr it is a record of the l<nowledge possessed by great adepts concerning what man really is. To look at the Tarot I(eys is to impress that knowledge on your subconscious mind through the medium of the natnral language of subconsciousness, pictorial symbolism. Tarot speaks to your subconsciollsness in its native tongue. It does not merely tell your brain-mind what you really are. It shows your subconsciousness the truth about yourself. Subconsciousness then builds the pattern represented by the I(eys into actual physical structure, gradually altering your physical and psychical composition so as to correspond to the Tarot specifications. Even though your brain-rnind may not grasp the significance of many details of the pattern, your subconsciousness will inevitably respond to it. Study of these lessons will also develop your conscious knowledge of the various elements in your personality. 'fhe numeral and other correlations of the Tarot Keys, being in accordance w:ith the actrta\"l laws of thought, practically force the conseious mind to perceive hol.,'the various aspects ofpersonality act and react on one another. 'fhus 'farot aft-ects both consciousness and subconsciousness. On the conscious level, it builds up, stage by stage, an orderly and accurate realization of the nature, powers and possibilities of human personality. On the subconscious level, it operates to bring into manifestation the perfected expression of all your powers by means of the bodybuilding functions of subconsciousness. When you use Tarot properly it shows you what you can be zrnd aids you to achieve actual realization of what it teaches you about yourself. Ifenoe it is important for you to follow the lessons with the Keys laid out before you. When you read about a l(ey, look at it. The words of the lesson will help you understand some part of the truth about yourself. Light-rays reflected from the pictures into your eye, after stimuiating your sight-center, will stir your subconsciousness into activities which will change your very flcsh and blood in response to the Tarot patterns. This is, indeed, an \"operation of the Sun,\" or a practical work belonging to the \"Magic of Light.\" The light which enables you to see the Keys either comes straight from the day-star itself, or it is a transformation of the sun's radiance into some other kind of illumination. us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION.. 12 'fhe six groups of I{eys dealt with in this lesson are as follows: 2,6,I0; 3,6,9; 4,6,8; 5,6,7; 2,3,4; and 8, 9, 10. You may, if you like, work out also the meanings of 2, 5, 8 and 4 , 7 , l0 . The general meaning of the six groups selected for interpretation is this: Memory is the basis of our grasp of our relation to the cycles of cosmic activity, but until the relation between the conscious and subconscious minds, and theirioint relation to superconsciousness, are thoroughly understood, the memory record will be faulty and our grasp of the law of cycles will be incomplete. It must be understood that memory (Key 2) is more than a record of personal experience. The scroll of the High Priestess has written upon it, so to say, a synopsis of the process whereby we come into existence, and this part of the subconscious memory record is kept in the cells of the solar plexus (Key 10). Furthermore, subconsciousness must be in right relation to superconsciousness before the record can be made available for personal instruction. The self'-conscious mind must know that through right suggestion subconsciousness may be opened to an influx of wisdom from superconscious levels, and the appropriate suggestion rnust be given. This is done best by the simple act of attentive listening to the Inner Voice, to be considered later in this lesson. We must recognize the truth that within us is a point of contact with the Lhriversal Mind which already knows all there is to know about the law of cycles pictured by I(cy 10. Tiiis Universal iviinci, pictured by the angel in Key 6, communioates its knowiecige tti r-rs through the agency of subconsciousness. Whatever parl of that knowledge we may so receive becomes then an indelible portion of the personal memory record (Keys 2 ,6,I0). The limited experience of the senses is not adequate to serve as a basis for the creative imagination pictured by the Empress. Subconsciousness cannot set our personal house in order at its level unless, through its reflective power, we have established contact with superconsciousness, 'fhis contact, however, can be established in no other way than through the activity of the conscious mind. The latter must grasp intellectually the law that subconsciousness is always amenable to suggestion. It must formulate suggestions which set subconsciousness free from sense domination and onen it to receive instruction from superconsciousness. Wl\"ren this is done, we begin to be aware of the light symbolized by the star in the Hermit's lantern, and we set out consciously toward the goal of union with the One Identity. We must know that this union is actually the result of physiological changes whose roots are in the process of assimilation. We deliberately take up the work of br\"rilding a new body, a new personality. Our conscious minds cannot do the building. Their part is to see that the building is begun, that the specifications are laid down, that the materials are assembled for the work. Then the task of actual construction is handed over to the subconsciousness, which begins by"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T A R O 7' I N T' E RP R ET A T I O N .. ta IZ submitting plans, or mental images in the fbrm of desires which embody the essential ideas we wish to manifest (Keys 3,6,9). These mental images are then subjected to the tests of reason (Key 4). At our present level of clevelopment, not every image which rises fiom subconsciousness is one we really desire to realize. Our f'ertility of invention sometimes exceeds our true requirements. The plans must be tested and approved. This is distinctly the work of self-conscious reasoning, pictured by the Emperor. Again, it is necessary that we should have keen discrimination as to the two modes of personal consoiousness. It is not the part of subconsciousness to criticize. It is her part to produce; and weeds of ertor, such as faulty observation, old habits of tliought, and so on, sprout just as quickly in that fertile soil as does the good seed of wisdom. This is the point of the parable in the Gospel according to St. Matthew, concerning the wheat and the tares. \"So the setvants of the householder came and said unto him, 'Sir', didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares?' He said unto them; 'An enemy hath done this.' The servants said unto him, 'Wilt thou then that we go and gathel them up?' \"But he said, 'Nay, lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root out also the wheat with them. Let !-.'oth grorv together until the harvest; and in the t;irne of harvest I r.vill say to the rsapers, Cathei' first the tates, and bind them into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.\"' (Mattheu' 13:27 to 30). This is the principle of revision, well understood by all creative thinkers. Experienced writers, for exarnple, always let their first draft of a work come as it will with little or no attempt at control. it is latal to give too much attention to matters of detail and form while writing a first draft. Much practice, of course, reduces the amount of waste. When the two aspects of consciousness are balanced in their operation, as shown in Key 6, the original specifications fbr a given piece of work are usually so definite that the subconscious response to them is similarly accurate. In time, every level of consciousness is brought into harmonious activity, because the reasoned definitions of the conscious mind are correct. Thus the suggestions given to the personal subconsciousness are what they ought to be, and all confusion and disharmony are eliminated from the deeper strata of subconsciousness (Iteys 4, 6,8). Perhaps the most important thing to remember is to make a regular practice of turning over all one's problems to the Inner feacher symbolizedby the Hierophant. No problem is too small, none too great. The simple act of sitting still and listening for the counsel of the Inner Voice is the most potent suggestion for effecting the balance of the two modes of personality shown in I(ey 6. As a result of this practice, which rapidly develops true discrimination, one us0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T'A RO'I I N 7' E R P RETA T I O N 12 becomes very definitely aware of the real presence of the One Self which an ancient scripture describes as \"the rider in the chariot of the body.\" In brief, all these good results accrue from regular, daily practice of the counsel; \"Be still, and know that I am God\" (Keys 5, 6, 7). I(ey 6, then, is seen to be a picture of the true relation between what is elsewhere represented in Tarot I(eys 3 'and 4. Just as the man in Key 6 looks toward the woman, so does the Emperor look toward the Empress. She is the bringer-forth. Ife is the inciter of her activity. Mere memory, like the High Priestess, is virgin and therefore sterile. But when memory is elaborated in creative imagination, in the active composition and development of imagery, in response to accurate reasonable interpretations ofexperience, then subconsciousness brings fbrth a rich store of good fbr mind and body. Then, too, the memory record is made richer as the direct result of the imaging process, and the richer, also, by the orderly classifications of reason (Keys 2,3, 4). Sirnilarly, the Hermit, conespollding to the angel of Key 6, has Strength and the Wheel of Fortune on either side of him in the series of keys . . . Strength being a symbol of subconscious activities, and the Wheel of Fortune being a symbol of a certain type of conscious grasp of the operation of cosmic cycles. It is really always the light of Universal Wisdom (the Hermit's lantern) which brings about the control of natural forces shown in Key 8. And the state where we are consciously aware of ilic relation between our personal activities and ihe great sequences oi cnergy transformation pictured by Key l0 is brought about by the descent of power from the LJniversal Mind (I(eys 8, 9, l0). MEDITATIONS FIRST DAY: I(eys 2, 6, 10. My subconscious mind receives the influx of wisdom from superconscious levels. It is continually alert for impressions from that highest source. Its office is to make me aware of rny true place in the universal order. United to the One Life, rny thoughts, words and deeds this day are harmonious expressions of the perfect Universal Order. SECOND DAY: Keys 3, 6, 9. Abundance in all things is mine. The rich gifts of the spirit come fieely to me through subconscious channels. I am overshadowed by the perfecting presence of the One ldentity. Wisdom, right discrimination, and security are mine this day. THIRD DAY: Keys 4, 6, 8. I establish order in my affairs. I release my subconsciousness liom all domination by selfish personal motives. I am strong in mind and body through the establishment of inner harmony.
