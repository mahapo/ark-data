The constant surnmation of the magic square is 39. It shows reversal (Key l2), expressing the Law of Response (Key 9) by the agency of creative imagination (Key 3). I(ey 13 represents the principal means whereby the forces symbolized by the pairs of opposites in the tableau are balanced. Key 12 shows the outcome of this equilibration. All the meanitrgs of this tableau revolve round the idea of change symbolized by I(ey 13. Remember that although there is a sense in which Key 13 does relate to the phenomenon of the cessation of a particular personal existence on the physical plane, it refers also to many other deeply esoteric doctrines. The saying in the Bible that the last enemy to be overcome is death has a direct bearing on these deeper meanings. Plainly and briel.ly, the doctrine of Ageless Wisdom is that the actual processes which bring about the cleath of the human body are expressions of laws and forces which need only to be 9 l0 ll 12 1a IJ IA r.t 15 t6 t7 t2 17 10 t1 l3 l5 16 9 l4 Its0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TIIIOT ]NTERPRET'A7-]ON.' 19 understood in order to release us fiom bondage to death. When we thoroughly understand what mahes us physically die, we shall learn also the secret of eternal life. It is because mankind has feared death, has been so terrified by it that few indeed have had courage to study death closely. Little progress has been made in this important branch of occult knowledge. The few who have looked death in the face have reaped as their reward the revelation of a priceless secret, This is what the alchemists mean by saying: \"Dissolution is the secret of the Great Wotk.\" So begin your study this week by attentive examination of Key 13, reviewing whatever explanation of the symbols you have received in other texts. Give special thought to the rising sun. Open your inner ear to any suggestion which may come to yott from the Inner School concerning the seed symbol in the upper left-hand corner of the picture. When the I(eys are laid out in the tableau, this seed form seems to point upward toward the Hermit, but in the nragic square it points toward the Hanged Man. In this connection, consider all you know about the letter Yod, to which the Hermit is attributed and all we have said concerning the significance of the element of water. Observe, also, that the rising sun is really one of the stars pictured in Ke1' ll. Consicler: Keys 10, 12,16 and 14, as they are placed in the tableau. At the top you see a s),urlrol ot-tlre turning wheel of time. The '.;nmoved sphinx, symbol of the spirit of hurnanity is sitting still while the wheel turns. At the left is the Key showing human personality as the temporary suspension of the whirling forces of the universe by the coudensation of those fbrces into a particular form. 'fhus one of the meanings of Key i2 is that personality is like a whirlpool. It maintains its iclentity because of fbrces flowing through it, and when these are turned in another direction, the whirlpool of personality disappears. Our apparent stability as entities on the physical plane is only temporary. If we fall into the error of supposing physical plane existence to be our whole being, if we let this error develop into the delusion that a human life on the physical plane is an isolated fact, unrelated to the whole sweep of cosmic manifestation, then, inevitably, come the terror and clestruction pictured by l(ey 16, which, in this tableau, is beneath Key 13, Death. Wiser counsel, and certain types of experiment which are open to us, will overcome the delusion. 'l'hen we shall see that physical existence is but an incident in our total life expression and the open way shown in Key 14 will take us to the heights of spiritual realizatiou. Fundamentally, it is the energy of the Primal Will, symbolized by the light in the Hermit's lantern, which is at work in the various processes which break down the tissues of the human"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"'t'ARO7' INTERPIIETATION: t9 body. The breakdown of tissue releases this energy in various forms of our personal activity-thinking, feeling, doing. Even a person apparently as inactive as a sage who sits motionless in profound meditation is, nevertheless, engaged in action. One evidence o1'this is tlrat genuine work in mental control by concentration and meditation makes the body perspire lieely. Intense mental work of the kind leading to direct perception of higher forms of reality, is work that breaks down cell tissue just as cerlainly as does muscular eflbrt. Perspiration is always evidence that the skin is eliminating fatigue poison, and fatigue poison is a consequence of the disintegration of cells. (Keys 9, 13, 17) Look again at the Keys in this tableau. Notice the symbol has two wavy lines at the bottom of the wheel just over the letter R, and, in this arrangement, over Key 13. This is an alchemical symbol for dissolution, but it is also the character used by astrologers for Aquarius, the zocliacal sign which is represented in the upper left-hand corner of Key l0 by the heacl of a man. The man's head is in the same relative position as the seed symbol in I(ey 13. This is also the place occupied in l(ey 16 by the falling crown. Man is the seed fbrm of a state of life-manifestation treyond himself. One error that besets him is the supposition that his present state is the crown of creation. In a sense, to be sure, that which is the essence of human life is identical with the one great Reality. The error is in the supposition that the Great Work is brought to its completion by the appearance of the \"natural man.\" When the human race stops, so to say, and loses its vision of the Beyond, then confusion and terror come. Read the Bible story of the Tower of Babel. You will notice that the desire to builcl a memorial to present glory caused all the trouble. Key 16 shows the same error depicted. The Tower is a symbol of a vain attempt to arrest the onward florv of the Life-power. It represents the sum-total of tlie effors growing out of the folly of supposing that humanity, at its present level of development, is the be-all and end-all of the creative process. As most of us know it, human personality is only a stage of that process. Beyond this stage lie untold and unguessed glories. More than this, some few beings in every generation, grasping this truth, have in their own persons verified it, and have passed beyond the limitations whicli the ma.jority suppose to be fixed, unalterable laws. Some persons know the past and the future, as well as the present. Some persons can read the innermost secrets of the human heart. Some persons are not restricted to the one spot on earth where their physical bocly happens to be. Even some of us, who have caught barely a glimpse of the tremendous possibilities of this seed fbrm we call \"Man,\" have received our own small but definite assurance that our limits are not so f-rxed as once we believed. (Keys 10, 13, 16) Even exoteric dogmas have their germ of tnrth because they are veils for deeper meanings. We may smile at the popular notion that death is the gate to a heaven where all the injustices which seem to be rampant on this globe will be made right. Yet there is a deep occult sense in which it is true that by dying we enter the heaven-world where evil ceases to hold us in r ts0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7'ARO7- INT'ERPRE'I'47']ON. ] 9 bondage. I{ave you ever stopped to think that even the person who began to study this course of lessons is actually no more? To the degree that your occult study has brought you enlightenment, to that degree the disintegrative process symbolized by Key 13 has eliminated some portion of the person you were when you began your studies. Problems that terrified you then have been solved. Difficulties have been overcome. You can see the rvorking ofjustice in situations which formerly appeared to you to be unmixed evils. Your taitlr-an open-eyed, reasonable f'aith, enables you to look forward to further adjustnrctrts. You have come to know that whatever bondage you seem to be enduring is really a result of ignorance. You are beginning to understand ignorance as resistance of certain parts of your physical organism to the passage of the light of the Life-power's perfect knowledge of all things. T'hus, by dying to the old personality, you are already glirnpsing your place in the great cosmic order, and that place is, in very truth, the \"heaven\" where no unrighteousness can enter, where sorrow is at an end, where perfect justice is the unvarying rule. (I(eys 1 1, 13, 15) I{eturning to the simile of the whirlpool as a symbol fbr existence on the physical plane, remernber that every whirlpool is in a state of intense activity. Yet the working power behind the activity is the flow of the river through the whirlpool. So it is with human life. False mysticism is the refuge of deluded souls who fancy that by refusing to engage in action they corne ctoser to Reali[,. Such persons try to avoid doing what tlreir halrds find to do. True realization is what is pictured by the l{anged Man, the knowledge that the motive power does not reside in the personality. One snspencls the false notion that what one does is self-originated. True mystics, thetefore, are never mere Quietists. Many of them are prodigious workers. None ever are shirkers. Some work with their brains and nerve centers rather than with their hands, but just the satne, they r,vork. Yet in all they do, they are aware that their personal activity is but a phase of the world process on which that activity depends. 'fhis mental attitude is especially favorable to the subtle changes in body chemistry (closely connected with nervc currents active in the area of the body governed by Scorpio) which bring about the awakening of the higher functions of the brain. As these functions become active, the consciousness of the person changes. He dies to the old man and rises again into a higher or\"der of knowing whicli old books on magic call \"The Knowledge and Conversation of the IIoly Guardian Angel.\" Remember, \"angel\" means messenger. The particular angel now having charge of the unfolclment of your life may not be anything like what most persons imagine angels to be. 'Ihere are angels and angels, and that center of the Life-power's expression which is the means of leading you higher is your particular angel for this stage of your journey along the Way to Freedom. (I(eys 12, 13, 14) ( ts0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TA IIO'I' I N 7' ERP RE'I'A T' I O N., ] 9 Remember this ftindamental doctrine of Ageless Wisdom: All tbrms of life-expression are vehicles of the One Identity. Behind and above your particular \"guardian angel\" for the present moment is the over-shadowing perfection of the One Identity. FIe (or it may be she) to whom is entrusted the work of supervising the present stage of your progress, is but a messenger and representative of that Supreme One. 'fhejourney yoll are making toward the heights is the Way of Return. It is the upward arc of flie wheel of manif-estation, You, and the rest of humanity, are like Hermanubis on the Wheel of'Fortune. Your spiritual eyes are beginning to catch glimpses of the glorious Beyond which the Fool sees (hence the eyes of Hermanubis are level with the letter A, or Aleph.) Your spiritual ears are beginning to bring you some inkling of the truth that your real being is one with the ONLY ONE,. YoLrr f-aith is being confinned by experience, even as it is founded on reason. You do not believe blindly, Ageless Wisdom says to you: \"Come, let us reason together.\" It shows you relationships among the various phases of existence which are passed over by most persons. It sharpens your powers of observation. It points out the footprints of the Master Principle, and develops your creative imagination so that you can see with the eye of faith what your physical eyes have not yet witnessed. On ils practical sidc, it is enabling 5'ou to mslic fine rrtust:nents in I'or-:i thinL:ing, nn.C is teaching you how to direct your emotional life into better channels of expression. All this is making you gradually into a new person. What you were is passing away. What you are is better than what you were. As your spiritual vision grows keener through creative imagery, you will come to understand that pregnant saying: \"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and although it has not been made manifest what we shall be, we know that when He shall be manifested, we shall be like Hirn, for we shall see Him as He is.\" (I(eys 9, 10, 11) The rvorld of natural men and women see Hirn as He is not. Because of this, the \"God\" of exoteric theology is all too often more devilish than divine. 'I'hus tlie fearful image of the Devil in Tarot is a picture of God misunderstood, or seen mentally as He is not. This vision of terror has been conjured up by the collective imagination of the natural man who looks with dread on anything which seems to threaten the continuance of fixed states of existence; for the natural man puts his trust in form and seeks the perpetuation of fbrm. Therefore he fears change, dreads novelty, detests difference. Conformity is his fetish, and when any of his fellows dares be different, the natural man will go to any length to suppress the innovation and get rid of the innovator. Look about you, and you will find many evidences that this is all too prevalent, even in our supposedly more enlightened times. u,c0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TAIIOT I N'TERP IIETATION., ] 9 Examine closely this pictr\"rre of the Devil. He represents all that does not \"ftt in\" with our comfbrtable preconceptions. But the Life-power will not be limited by our ignorance. It is always presenting us with new appearances which seem to be exceptions to our notions of order. Thus the natural man personifies these unknown activities as the demon and ascribes his failnres to the malicious influence of the Adversary. (I(eys 15,16,17) MEDITATIONS FIRST DAY: I(eys 9, 73,17. The resistless energy of the Primal Will courses through me. It breaks down every obstacle to its onward movement. It opens my understanding, so that I perceivc the beauty of the Great Pattern of manifestation. The One Identity transforms me into Its likeness and opens my eyes to the wonders of Its Perfect Law. SECOND DAY: l(eys 1 0, 13, 16. I am ascending into a highel order of being. 'l'his very day is a clay of change flom the imperfections of the past into a closer approach to the Divine Iteality. The lightning-flash of inspilation overthrows my mistaken structures of ignorance ancl prejudice. I am an expression of the eternal progress and transforming power of life which breaks down every prison house of ignorance. TIIIRD DAY: I(eys 11, 13, 15. Mine is a reasoned faith. I die daily away frorn the rnisapprehensions of the past. I begin to see that evil and seeming injustice are but aspects of tire Goocl, stages of the Litb-power's unfoldment whicli I have yet to understand. I am a center of the power of cosmic adiustment lvhich overcomes and transforms into beauty every appearance of evil. ITOIJRTI{ DAY: Keys 12, 13,14. 'fhe Life-porver in me, and flowing through me, does all this. My thoughts and words and deeds are but phases of the Great Transformation. Let rne be guided this day by that Messenger of Reality whose of1ice it is to direct my steps along the Way to Freedom. I am calm and poised in the midst of all these changes, for I know they are translbrming me into a more perl'ect image of the One Reality' FIFTI-I DAY: I(eys 9, 10, I 1. The One Identity watches over me. The cycles of necessity bring rne ever nearer to the Inevitable Perfection. The forces of my life are balanced and trtte. My true Self is the Witness, the Mover, and the Regulator of Its perfect worh. SIXTI{ DAY: I(eys 15, 16,17. There is no bondage save that of ignorance and fear. Am I in prison? Then I have built the walls myself. Reality needs no walls for its protection, nor will Truth suffel herself to be veiled. Seeming evil is my opportunity to break down some barrier of ignorance and find my way into the paradise of things as they really are.
