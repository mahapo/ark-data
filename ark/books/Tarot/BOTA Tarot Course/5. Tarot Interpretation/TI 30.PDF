[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT INTBRPRETATION Lesson Thirty 'fhe 'fableau for this lesson is: 'fhe constant summation is 54. This indicates l(ey 9, the Hermit, considered as the operation of the power symbolized by Key 4, the Emperor, working through the agency represented in Tarot by I(ey 5, the Hierophant. 'lhe Hennit corresponds to the 20th path on the TREE OF LIFE, named Intelligence of Will. THE BOOK OF FORMATION says: \"It is so called because it forms the patterns of all bodies; and by this intelligence, when it is perceived, the pre-existent Wisdom is discovered.\" The letters of the Hebrew noun ?lS'1, rawtsone, \"Will,\" are four, and by their Qabalistic correspondences they represent radiant energy or fire (\"t); air (I); earth (l); and water (f). Thr.rs the occult significance of the word relates to the idea of a synthesis of the four elements, which synthesis is none other than the One Reality, the Ancient of Days represented by the Hermit, and customarily designated by the Divine Name, i'1'1i1r, Jehovah. In the \"Mind of the Father,\" as TIIE CHALDEAN ORACLES call it, are the primary patterns of all things, and each pattern is a mental embodiment of the intention or pu{pose, or Will, of the [Jniversal Mind. These archetypal patterns are maintained throughout a cycle of manifestation, and thus they are imposed upon all particular centers of lif'e-expression. These patterns in the mind of the Father are the conditions of manifested existence, the alchetypal roots of all states of embodiment. Orderly forrnulation of knowledge concerning these conditions is the method of science, exoteric and esoteric. Exoteric science regards these conditions as being given by forces or powers external to man, who observes and studies them. Occult science, on the contrary, declares that the Mind of the Father is a real presence in every human being. It holds that when Jesus said, \"I and the 9 t9 20 6 I4 12 11 t7 10 16 15 13 2I 7 8 18 {ls0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TA ROT ! N'IERP IIETATION. 30 Father are One,\" he was simply declaring his personal realization of a fact which is iust as truly a fact for those persons who have not yetreahzed it. Thus Occult Science declares that the power which forms the patterns of all bodies is a real, integral part of man's constitution. From this it fbllows that the conditions round us are not imposed from outside, but are actually expressions of our innermost, true Will. Not until the difference between the functions of the conscious and subconscious levels of personal mentality have been understood in some measure, may we come to know the Will of the Father. Confusion as to the nature of these functions, ignorance of the differences between the two modes of personal consciousness, and consequent attempts to do consciously what ought to be done subconsciously (or vice versa) are among the most potent causes of our human predicaments. As soon as we rcahze that the conscious mind in personality is only the watcher and initiator of action, as soon as we act upon the fact that subconsciousness is the body-builder and the link between personality and the Universal Self, the confusion begins to clear up. All practical occultism is a development of the fundamental facts and laws illustrated by the sixth Tarot I(ey. It is on this account that the final Key of the major trumps bears a number which is the extension of the number of the Lovers. For 2l is the sum of the numbers from 0 to 6, inclusive. This to a number symbolist, is equivalent to saying that what is represented by Key 21 is merely the unfoldment of the possibilities shown in Key 6. Our tableau this week, then, reminds us that to know the Will of the Father, we must have used the law of suggestion to turn the subconscious mind, like a mirror, so that it reflects the light of superconsciousness into the field of personality (Key 6). Conscious immortality, as we have shown elsewhere, is the direct consequence of our subconscious contact with the true Self. For when that contact is established, the body-building functions of subconsciousness are modified. The patterns in the Mind of the Father are reflected into the field of personality, and tlrere ensues a complete reorganization of the personal vehicle. 'l'his reorganization includes the awakening of the functions of certain bodily centers which enable us to become consciously aware of the fact that we are four-dimensional eternal beings (I(ey 20). Such awareness is the immediate consequence of a regenerative process just as much physical as mental (Key 19). This regenerative process turns us away from the lirnitations of the sense life and opens to us the glories of the supersensual realm. In this realm we establish contact with the Intelligence of Will, and realize at last our identity with the Silent Watcher (Key 9). The truth about the Self unveils itself to us in our hours of meditation. As it is written in LIGHT ON TIIE PATII: \"Look for the flower to bloom in the silence that follows the storm: not till then.\" Hence in Tarot the Key picturing this experience (I(ey 17) is placed immediately after the one which shows a violent storm. Only through right meditation can us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION: 30 confidence be developed in the absolute justice of cosmic law. Such confidence is inclispensable to him who would establish equilibrium in his own personality (Key 11). It is because the practice of meditation puts us in touch with the Inner Life that it is so insisted upon in all manuals of practical occultism. Again we quote from LIGFI'I ON THE PATH: \"For within you is the light of the world . . . Tluough your own heart comes the one light which can illuminate life and make it clear to your eyes.\" These quotations are fiom the portions numbered l2 in the first and second sections of LIGHT ON THE PATH, and they are in direct correspondence with the Hanged Man (Key 12). After the suspension of personal action, after the utter resignation of the personal life to the guidance of Universal Spirit, comes the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. That Angel effects the transmutations of all the base elements of the personal life (Key 14). Ardent desire for power is required of us, but the power we are taught to desire is not power over others. It is contact with the Life-power itself, and this contact is often described as \"knowledge.\" But this is not superficial brain-knowledge. It is not ordinary information. It is an intimate union, closely approximating the archaic significance of the verb \"to know\" and directly connected with the sublimation of the forces corresponding to the zodiacal sign Soorpio (Key 13). Such knowledge brings about the development of the inner senses and results in comprehension of the true significance of the various combinations of elemental fbrces. To the eye of outer sensation, these combinations seem to be chaotic and their activities seem to constitute a strong opposition to our plans and purposes. To the spiritual eye they present another aspect. When that eye is opened the Adversary is recognized as a liiend wearing a rnask of terror while He teaches us how to play the game of life (Key 15). Tlrrough his instruction we learn to conquer the false desires of the outer senses, and are enabled to overthrow the edifice of erroneous supposition, erected on the foundation of the sense of separateness (I(ey 16). Ultimately we discover the truth that everything in the field of manifestation is related to everything else. We see our personal existence as part of the whole cycle of manifestation. We perceive that the events of today are directly connected with the entire past, andiust as truly joined with the whole future (Key 10). Following the Path of Return, which leads within, we pass beyond the limits of ordinary experience into that vast Beyond whence come the reports of Those Who Know, our Elder Brothers who have preceded us. We are on the same path as They, for all that They seem so far beyond us. Frorn them comes the message: \"The whole nature of man must be used wisely by the one who desires to enter the way.\" For occult development includes the physical or corporeal natlre, and is not complete until the outermost vehicle of Spirit, the physical body, has been transfbrmed by the renewal of the mind (Key 18). r-1s0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION 30 In this transformation the work is almost wholly subconscious. The conscious mind simply perceives the law and formulates the demand or pattern. The actual reorganization which brings the animal nature completely under control is effected at subconscious levels (Key 8). Hence we are told, \"I(ill out the hunger for growth.\" The transformation which is to be effected is not growth, not the addition of something we do not now possess. Rather is it a re-arrangement of the vehicles of consciousnes$-a better co-ordination or alisnment of the instrumentalities of Life-expression. The glorious truth is that the Self already is all that we aspire to be-and infinitely more. Not attainment, in the ordinary sense of the word, butrcalization of what already is, is the Goal (I(ey 7). No words can describe that realization. It is conscious identification with Universal Spirit. Perfect peace, perfect bliss, perfect knowledge. All this it is, and more than this (Key 2r). The Administrative Intelligence, which corresponds to the final Tarot Key, really means \"the seruing Intelligence.\" Cosmic consciousness, or the reahzation of identity with the Universal Spirit, finds expression in work for the more complete manifestation of the heavenly order here on earth. He who knows the truth must needs live it. He becomes thenceforth a servant of the ALL. He does this, not as a duty hard to carry out, but as a natural expression of his realization of his true place in the cosmic order (Key 21). For such a person, all selfish preoccupation w'illi personal airns is au'ronla'Liualiy at an erid (Key i 6). iie iuoks on liis personal existence as being a manifestation of that exquisite adjustment which maintains the cosmic equilibrium. In his vision, all he does is naught but the manifestation of Karma: and because he has made himself, as a personality, utterly receptive to the inllux of the Universal Will, whatever action he engages in is extraordinarily effective (l(ey l1). On the side of self-consciousness, he acts merely as a witness of the universal order. He l<nows that alert watchfulness is necessary. He is intent on each succeeding phase of experience. Most of all, he is intent on clear reception from the superconscious Will through the channel of subconsciousness (Key 6). J'he conscious mind, by right reasoning, infers the presence of the Universal Will as the guiding power at the heart of the personal life. Even though the Silent Watcher be unseen, right reasoning shows that He is present (Key 9). From this it follows that the only logical procedure is to submit the whole personal life to that Higher Guidance. By repeated self-reminder, one comes at last to regard all the operations of the personal life as having their real source in supersensual and superpersonal planes of the Life-power's operation (Key 12). This intellectual correction ofappearances does not banish the appearances during our ordinary states of waking consciousness. The illusion of separateness continues, but the delusion which accepts this illusion as reality is overcome by the change in mental attitude.

MEDITATIONS FIRST DAY: Keys 6, 20,19,9. Subconsciousness reflects the light and wisdom of the Oversoul into my field of personal awareness. Thus I receive the power of etemal lif.e in the midst of this illusion of temporal existence. I am beginning to live the life of regeneration. I know my identity with the Silent Watcher. SECOND DAY: I(eys 17, 17,12,14. The flower of realization blooms in the silence of rneditation. I am sure of the absolute justice of cosmic law. The light of the world is within me. That light transmutes my whole existence into its likeness. THIRD DAY: I(eys 13, 15, 16, i0. Even the least of my activities is a transformation of the One Lil'e-power. i hus I know that whatever mask of terror confronts me it really veils the face of the Eternal Friend.

I follow the Path of Return, transforming my body by the renewal of my mind. My life today is a stage in my progress toward the perfect demonstration of the Great Secret. My true Self is, even now, all that I aspire to be. I am all peace, all bliss, all knowledge. FIFTH DAY: Keys 21 ,16,11, 6. Let me be a servant of all. No aim is mine that others cannot share. I am an instrument of the Life-power's perfect ability to adjust all things for good. Let me be intent on clear perception of the Great Purpose. SIXTH DAY: Keys 9, 12,15,18. Though I see Him not, I feel today the presence of the Silent Watcher. I submit my whole life to His perfect guidance.

Obligating oneself to a formal dedication, intensifies the energies, brings about a more rapid personality transmutation. For the next two weeks, examine your mind and heart carefully. Ask yourself how well you have lived the spiritual life towards your family, your business associates, your friends and your activities. Try to remain alert and aware, so that you can determine in what manner you can improve your performance, in order to become an every more radiant expression of love, compassion and wisdom. us0300"}]
