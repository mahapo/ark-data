[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT II{TERPRETATION Lesson Twenty-One RENEWING THE MIND l'he tableau for this week is: The magic square is: ln both ar\"rangements the central I(ey is number 15, the Devil. The constant summation of the magic square is 45. It shows our consciousness of the overshadowing presence of the One ldentity (l(ey 9) as the consequence of the operation of intuition (Key 5) through reason (Key 4). Thus this tableau shows intuition as the source of material upon which reason works to the end that we may become truly responsive to the One ldentity. I(ey 15 shows what brings us to this awareness. I(ey 9 is the Tarot representation of that awareness itself. The constant summation of the rnagic square is the number of the word E'1N, Adam (N, 1; 1,4;D, 40). Thus we may expect to find that this square of Tarot Keys yields some definite answer to the question, \"What is Man?\" Again,45 is the extension of 9, or the sum of the numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive, so that this constant summation ofthe magic square points to the complete expression of the power represented by I(ey 9. If we put all these ideas together it begins to be evident that here Tarot is reminding us: 1. That reason is not limited for materials to past experience, or to the sense life.

The Emperor, in other words, does not surrender his rule at his own level even to the I{ierophant, and reason must check up on intuition before intuition can be of use to us at the self-conscious level of human life. 2. That although awareness of the One Identity comes to us intuitively, this intuition is not complete rcahzatton. To attain to realizatron,the intuition must be perceived at the conscious level of reason, and at that level built into our mental scheme of the cosmic order. This is necessary because full realization of our relation to the One Identity requires certain definite changes in our bodily structure and chemistry. It is true that the merely natural man cannot receive the higher knowledge of the Spirit. It is true also that the bodily changes which enable him to receive that knowledge must be effected by the agency of the subconscious mind. But the subconscious mind is normally under the direction of the self-conscious level of awareness. True it is that, as Key 6 intimates, we may so train subconsciousness that she will act as the reflector of superconscious knowledge into our lleld of personal awareness. Yet to give us a full realization, subconsciousness must change our physical bodies, and this it cannot do unless we accept such transmutation as not only possible, but also reasonable. This is the inner significance of that passage which says: \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.\" Here recall that I(ey 9 represents Intelligence of Will. 3. That the place of Man in the cosmic order is to act as an agent whereby the Cosmic Will may be proved, or tested and tried. Man, where evolution leaves him, is ready for transformation. Evolution can carry him no farther along the path. A thousand thousand generations hence will find no man liberated from conformity to \"this world\" unless he participates in his own self-evolution. The unique position of man, among all the creatures we know anything about, is that he can change his body by changing his mind and thus provide himself with a new instrument through which the Life-power may manifest the higher levels of its infinite potencies. Faith is required for this, but all attributions of Key 1 1, which represents the Faithful Intelligence, show us that this is not blind faith. The properly instructed student of Ageless Wisdom has a deep and abiding faith, rooted in observation, and perfected by reason. The problems of life do not look less terrifying to an occultist than they do to an ordinary man. The difference is that the practical occultist has been through a course of training which makes him know that no problem is really so bad as it looks."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETAT]ON 2I As he advances in his experimental work he learns also that there are sources of knowledge and power other than those repofted to us by our senses. He is not sense-bound, for when he begins to succeed in his practical work, he becomes actually a new creature. I{is outward appearance may not be strikingly different from that of the rest of humanity. Ilis inner life, liowever, is of a different kind. He knows himself to belong to what is virtually a new species on this planet---a species, so to say, self-generated. (Keys 11, 15, 19) ln the passage just quoted from St. Paul, the original Greek says: \"Be not fashioned in accordance with this age.\" Such is the invariable message of Ageless Wisdom. Therefore are its adepts always like strangers, even among their own kin, men and women whose whole course of life is looked upon with distrust, and, unless they conceal their aims and convictions, such persons are often denounced and persecuted, even unto death. What is the fashion in any age is never the Inner Truth, for fashions change under the influence of the race subconsciousness. The practical occultist aims, first of all, to reverse conditions by reversing his thought. His views are in nearly every respect the exact opposites of those held by a merely natural man. Listen, for example, to Eliphas Levi, who tells us ofthe Great Magical Agent in these words: \"The Astral Light is the key of all dominion. It is the first physical manifestation of the Divine Breath. The Gnostic represented it as the buming body of the Holy Ghost. It is represented on ancient monuments by the serpent devouring its own tail. It is the Hyle of the Gnostics. Lastly, it is the ,l-.';l ^c -.'^*^,.;^ .1.^^,*^r i -,.. :' svr ll vr wAvlwllv uuBlrt4LlJltl. That is to say, it is what Tarot represents by Key I 5. But what a reversal of common opinion to say that the \"key of all dominion\" is the \"devil of exoteric dogmatism!\" Small wonder that sages have sr-rftbred martyrdom in every age when the herd mind has had the upper hand in the affairs of men! The great problem the practical occultist has to face is one which assumes ever changing forms. lt is the problem of his own ignorance, and particularly the problem of his ignorance as to the reversal of the curuents of the Astral Light. lle who solves this problem can rule all things, for he can so change his physical body that it may be used as an instrument for the direction of modes of force which would consume the ordinary physical vehicle of human personality. (Keys 12, 15, 18) \"Dissolution,\" say the alchemists, \"is the secret of the Great Work,\" and they represent dissolution by the symbol which you see on I(ey 10 just above the letter R on the wheel. This is also the symbol for the sign Aquarius, the Water-bearer, the sign which has greatest power in the age we are now entering. It is peculiarly the sign of Man, represented on Keys 10 and 2Iby theman's head at the upper left-hand comer of the design. Thus it is toward whatthis signrepresents thatthe Fool is looking. In chemistry, dissolution is now tenned analysis, and this is what is meant by the alchemical dictumjust quoted. Every problem has first to be ar-ralyzed. Its component pafts must be separated fiom one another and carefully measured.

To understandthis picture of the Devil, we must take it to pieces. Then only do we see that what it really represents is something both male and female, something found in all the elements (wings, air; eagle's talons, water; goat's homs and gross body, earth; torch, fire). Then it dawns on us that the whole design represents a disorderly combination of forces, and the reversed pentagram at the top of the picture gives us a clue to the cause of the confusion. Trouble comes whenever man's ignorance rcverses his true position of dominion over the elements. In general, every problem is a phase of what Key 15 symbolizes. Analysis of any problern into its parts is valuable because it shows where these parts fit into the cosmic order. Thus analysis leads to synthesis, and synthesis unveils the beautiful truth behind the ugly face of every problem. (I(eys 13, 15,17) Man must participate in his self-evolution if he is to advance to higher levels than those represented by the consciousness of the herd-mind. Yet you must not understand from this that Ageless Wisdorn holds that man has a power which he may contribute to the Great Work, or may, if he so determines, withhold from that Work. For then man would be more powerful than the Universal Spirit whence he catne and could defeat the purposes of that Spirit. It is not turtil the work of the Spirit upon us, fiom within and without, has changed us so that we reabzewhat is going on within us that we may be said to participate in the Great Work. 'Ihose. for example. who reject the doctrine of Ageless Wisdom cannot accept it. St. paul had this in mind when he wrote: \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: fbr they are fbolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discemed.\" Up to a cefiain point, we are all subjects of the work of transmutation. Beyond that point, we become participants. From then on there is a subtle, but important, change in our merilal attitude. We no longer feal problems. We welcome every problem as a fresh opportunity. Problems do not look any less terrifying, but they cease to daunt us. Because we know ourselves to be centers of expression for a power wise enough to resolve every problem into its component parts, and bring those parts together again in an orderly arrangement, we face every problem boldly without bitterness of hearl. This state of mind does not come all at once. It is preceded by the breakup of many structures of fhlse knowledge. Storm and stress precede the calm of serene meditation. Thus the Psalmist tells us that a heart utterly shattered and broken is not despised by God. He means that until we have clissolved our subconscious complexes of erroneous opinion, based on our acceptance ofthe illusion of separateness as being not an illusion but an actual reality, there is no possibility of advancing beyond the stage of bondage to problems and circumstance. This stage of extreme discomfort is the ordinary predicament of the natural man. (I(eys 14, 15, 16) 2l us0i00"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TA ROT IN'I- E RP RETAT I O N Remember that the transformation begins with faith. Nor is faith limited to religion, philosophy, or metaphysics. Our scientists exercise a degree of faith which surpasses in intensity anything which is achieved by the ordinary religious devotee. No person, for example, ever saw an electron, or a gene, but f'ew scientists doubt their existence. The fission of the atom was accomplished by men who had taith in things unseen which were revealed to them by the symbols of pure mathematics. Dr. George Crile has assefted that in every cubic inch of our muscles there are probably four billion tiny points of radiant energy, each of which has a temperature of from 3,000 to 6,000 degrees centigrade. His faith in the presence of these tiny hot points in our bodies is a reasonable faith, iustified by the fact that living tissue emits ultra-violet rays. Hence Dr. Crile argues that since we know it takes a temperature of at least 3,000 degrees to produce ultra-violet rays, there must be these high temperatures in extremely diminutive hot points in our muscles. We do not feel the heat because the points are so tiny that they do not aff-ect our senses. This discovery, by the way, is a direct confirmation of the old occult doctrine that man is a microcosm. The newspaper dispatch in which it was first reported said: \"We may say that protoplasm is a Milky Way consisting of 'solar systems,' infinitely diminutive, each created in its own image by the Sun's radiance.\" More recently, physicists have announced that the conception ofprotoplasm as being a f,rndamental living substance is no longer tenable. Protoplasm, they say, tums out to be simply a certain combinaticn of iiiattei, aiiJ its coinponcirt elerneiits do iio'r exliibit tlic chalaoteristic vitai phenornena we find expressed througli the protoplasmic combination. What we call life is manifested so that we may observe its activity whenever seemingly lifeless substances are combined in certain ways. This, of course, means that the potentiality of life is present in all \"matter,\" whether it be organic or inorganic. Hence what St. John said: \"God can of these very stones raise up children unto Abraham,\" is seen to be literally true. So, step-by-step, the advance of science confirms the ancient doctrines of occultism, and strengthens our reasonable conviction that human life is related to, and is dependent on, the entire worid-organism. The whole universe flows through us, and the stuff from which our bodies are made is structurally a miniature copy of the stars of heaven. This fiery energy is the basis of our existence as human personalities. The particular form of it which holds greatest possibilities for us is that which ordinarily finds expression through the reproductive function. When we know the nature of this energy, we can control its currents, and reverse their ordinary operation. By this means we may emerge from the bondage of the natural man into the freedom of the higher order of being for which the natural man is but a seed-form. In so emerging from natural humanity we shall be released, as our final demonstration, from bondage to tlre appearance of death which the Bible rightly describes as the \"last enemy.\" (I(eys II,12, 13) It4editation is one of the most important practices involved in our release from natural humanity. It is primarily a state of intentional receptivity to the spiritual life which flows into our field of 21 us0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":".1\"4 IIOT' INTEIIPRE7-ATION.. 2 I persollality fiorn superconscious levels.

Right rneclitation shoulcl be aimed always at the co-ordination of all our energies, as hinted by the balanced affangement of stars in I(ey 17, and this co-ordination lias a physical result.
