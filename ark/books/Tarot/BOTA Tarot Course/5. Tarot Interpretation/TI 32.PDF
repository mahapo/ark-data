[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT TNTBRPRETATION Lesson Thirtv-two This final lesson is intended to point out various practical ways to use the combinations of Tarot Keys, apart from their employment in exercises in meditation. Sr-rppose you have a specific problem. Consider it carefully. When you have done so, it will be lelatively easy to determine what I(ey symbolizes the esser,tial nature of the problem. Then select one of the tableaus ol magic squares in which that Key is a central unit. I-ay this arrangement of Keys before you and look at it with the definite intention of letting it evoke fiorn your inner consciousness an intimation of what should be your next step. Do not try to fbrce an answer. Sit ten or fifteen minutes with pencil and paper at hand for notes of any ideas which may come to you. If none come at the first sitting, do not be discouraged. Sometimes these hints from within come during the course of the day after the morning practice with the Keys. Often they pop into your head just as you are waking the next morning. I{owever this may work out, be sure to follow the suggestion.

To learn more about your individuality, use the squares and tableaus in which the central unit is the I(ey corresponding to your Sun sign. To learn more about your personality, use the squares and tableaus in which the central unit is the Key representing your rising sign; also those in which the central unit is the place of the Moon in your natal chart. If you do not know your rising sign, or the place of the Moon, consult some astrological friend. For one who knows even the rudiments of astrology, it is easy to determine the place of the Sun and the Moon, by sign, simply by rel'erring to an ephemeris fbr the year of your birth. Unless you know your birth-hour, the rising sign is not so easy to determine. But a great deal of insight into your own make-up can be gained by fcrllorving this method with the l(eys corresponding to the positions of the Sun and the Moon. By using the same method, you may get a better understanding of the lives of persons with whom you are associated. Even those who puzzle or annoy you may be less of a mystery if you use Tarot to help you get below the surface of their outward behavior. Yort may also use these combinations of Keys to develop a better knowledge of the particular principles and laws concerned with the realization of your heart's desire. What you want to be and do, more than anything else, is an expression of a principle symbolized by one of tl\"re 'Iarot l(eys. It may take a little time to determine which I(ey stands for what you want, but vou will find it if vou look.

Tarot is a catalogue of the fundalrental seed ideas and of their relations, one to another. 'fhus you may employ it to help you make clear itnages of the genninal principles fiom which the parlicular forms of expression you wish to experience are to be developed. What .lung calls the \"collective unconscious\" is a vast reservoir of these seed ideas. They are helcl therein as symbols. As the CHALDEAN ORACLES say: \"The Father of gods and men placeci the mind (nous) in the soul (psyche); and placed both in the human body, The paternal Mind hath sown symbols in the soul.\" Here what is called \"solll\" is what is called \"psyche,, throughout the New Testameut where it is distinguished from \"pneurra,\" or the rnode of the Life-power syrnbolized by the various masculine figure of Tarot. '['o be clominated by irnmature psychic levels of our consciousness is to be what St. paul calls tlre 'hatural man.\" It is to be within the fatal field of influences which Jacob Boellne termed the \"astral spirit.\" It is to be caught in the web of Maya (Illusion). Nevertheless, the symbols in the collective unconscious are the seeds of all possible combinations of physical conditions rdrich rnay be experienced by mankind. 'Io be able to evoke the images which correspond to the conditions we desire to have manifested in our surroundings is to possess a key to extraordinary exercise of power. We do not escape fiorn dornination by the \"astral spirit\" by ignoring it. We do not break the web of Maya by trying to destroy Maya itself. What liberates us is right use of the symbols sown in the soul. 'fhese seed ideas are actually the basis of all physicai conditions both known and as yet unknown to man. These seed ideas constitute either singly, or in definite numerical cornbinatiotts, principles upon which the universe around and in us is undeviatingly built. They may, but not necessarily must, be relatively few in number. The \"real events\" of this universe, which embraces all phenomena including us, are built in accordance with these basic principles. Consicler the building of a housing structure, be it a home or a sky scraper. There can be an infinite number of blue prints setting forth the specifications lbr an infinite variety of bLrildings. Nevertheless each set of plans must embody and conform to a relatively much smaller set of engineering principles . . . seed ideas implanted by the Cosmic Mind from which there rnust be no cleviation. Furthermore, the esoteric doctrine behind Tarot includes the explicit statement that all physical manifestation is the consequence of the creative mental activity of the Origi'ati'g Spirit. That Spirit is omnipresent, and is therefore present in man. Today, as always, it creates by processes of thought. From our self'-conscious human point of view, it appears I t,90300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"l'.4 ltO'f I N'I' D IIP R l:1'A'l' I O N . 3 2 that the physical universe, its energies and laws, are things given. They were here before we appearcd on the scene. They will be here after we leave it. So far as this goes, Ageless Wisdom agrees with it, but says the truth of the matter goes even farther. As persons, we had nothing to do with ow appearance on the scene. As persons, we do not set the stage. But within our personality dwells a higher life which is the real Being assuming the outrvard maslc of the personal existence. This real Being, the true I AM within us, is the only God there is. 'Ihis is the inner significance of the statement in Exodus to the eff'ect that the Name of God is i1!i'1N, Eheyeh, or I AM. In Ilebrerv, Eheyeh is the present indicative of the verb \"to be.\" Thus the Bible tells us that the true \"God\" is simply what really is and that the only intelligible name of God is simply the announcement of Absolute Being-I AM, without a predicate. All version of Ageless Wisdom bring us to this idea. All agree that the true Self at the center of every personality is identical with the Originating Spirit. Identical with it, not derived lrom it. Personality is derived. The Self is ONE. Fortunately for us, we do not have to grasp the fuil rneaning of this truth in order to use the power it gives us. We simply have to act as if it were true. This is the basis ol'true theurgy, or God-worl<ing, as contrasted with various fbrms of sorcery which aim to bolster up the weakness of human personality by calling outside entities to its aid. Much rvliich passes for religion is actually a form of sorcery. When prayer is conceived as being a method whereby the person praying flatters, or compels, some being outside to fulfil his desires, that prayer is a form of false magic. When prayer is recognition of an inclwelling power, able to modify external conditions because it is the power which brings to pass every external manifestation, such prayer is true theurgy. Various Nerv Thought cults have had some glimpse of this truth. So far as it goes, their rnethod of procedure is correct; but it often is lirnited by misunderstanding of the law whereby that method produces results. The law is that of fbcusing creative seed ideas in snbconsciousness. This is the law at work in all our use of Tarot. Man's place in the cosmic order is to act as a distributor fbr the power of Originating Spirit. Man is able to bring into actual, concrete rnanifestation new cornbinations of the seed ideas in LJniversal Mind. By so doing, he \"controls\" the forces of his environment, and brings into tangible existence, on the physical plane, conditions rvhich would never make their' appearance but for the action of human self-consciousness. Actually, of course, man does not exefi pelsonal control of circumstance, even when he is able to perform works of power which seem lihe miracles. For lrue theurgy is based on recognition that none of us ever does anything of himself. We clo not control. We act as conscious instruments of the original Creative Power which operates through us-always in u,\\0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T'ARO7' INl'DIIPl?ETAT'ION.. 32 harmony with its immr\"rtable laws. When we are awakened fiom the dream of separateness, we know the indwelling presence of this Creative Power and are made aware of its laws of manifbstation. T'hen we sirnply obey what we know, and the results amazeall who do not share the wisdom which colnes fiom within and above. The beginning of this modification of man's environment was probably the domestication of wild animals, by sub.jecting their lower orcler of intelligence to human direction. Then came agriculture, establishing special conditions in lvhich grass was transformecl into grai', as I-uther Burbank provecl conclusively. Step by step, man's consciousness was fashioned by the Lifc-pclwer, and tluough combinations of energy known as tools, man extended the empire ol'self'-consciottsness over subconsciousness. So was developed the complex system of artilrccs whereby the forces in our environment have been made to serve us. Wrat has not been well understood is that human personality is the fi1est tool of all. and. like other tools, may be irnproved. Human personality, even now, does express the Ad'rinistrative lntelligence symbolized by Tarot I(ey 21. When one realizes this, it becomes perfect human personality. By \"perltct,\" as we use it here, we do not mean that personality is to be brought to a stale such as is, by some thinkers, conceived as absolute perfectiol. What we mean is that the average man or \\\\ronlan is far fi'om living up to tlie true potentials of personality. As bror'rght itlto existence by what may be called the general averages of the evolutionary process, human personality is only \"tnan in the rough.\" like an early nrodel of some in'ention. Eveu the more \"advanced\" races (as some of their members like to imagine) are by no nteans perfected instruments for the Life-power's self-expression. Furthermore, members of supposedly \"backward\" races may, and do, equal, and sometimes surpass, the achierrements of members of races which, until very recently, were supposed to be the \"flower of hiunanity.', 'fhere are no superior, and no inferior races. Inf.erior personalities predominate over superior ones in every race, when one sintply counts heads. We have to learn the lesson of Key 14. Wherever a superior personality appears, that person always knows that he has been fashioned by the Lif-e-power and not by \"himself.\" This is one of the distinguishing characteristics of every tluly superior man or woman. Yet it is also true that before this higher self-knowledge blossoms into full splendor, a pleparatory period, during which one seelns to be in the midst of a sharp conflict a'd making intense personal eflbrt, precedes the actual realization. Mele lip-service to the idea that the Life-power is the only Thinker and the only Actor is 'ot enough; and the wise agree that even tlie perfected personality, except in rare moments of ecstasy. remains in the illusion of separateness. Consequently, he must exert what seems to be \"ltis\" will, but all liis exertion consists in the effor\"t to surrender that will to the One Will, to \"dive into the depths of Pure Being.\" In the outer affbirs of human existence, such a person is aotive, industrious, and assiduous. 'fhe main difference is that, though he experiences the u.s0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'r) ROT', I N',t' E R t' RE',t\"4'.t' I O ^r. 3 2 same illusions as the rest of mankind, he is never deluded by them. Thus his whole motivation is clifferent, and so is his main purpose. Sr.rch a perfectecl human personality knows, even in the early stages of his awakening, the wonderful truth that the destiny of man is to go beyond humanity. Man is truly the Son of (iod, and, as the old Rosicrucian aphorism puts it, \"There is no God but Man.\" In every manl's innermost being, the essential Reality is what we call \"God.\" Nor should we be provincial in our concept of the word \"man.\" This is a large universe with probably billions of inhabitable planets . . . not to mention other modes of existence. Man can exist in other places and forms when he evolves beyond the pr\"rrely animal state. For in our Father's house are many mansions, both physical and nonphysical, wherein Man dwells. I{Luran personality, however, masl<s the true nature of man, and this mask makes urrenliglrtened human beings appear to one another as animals, or even as mere objects. This delusion is characteristic of the greater number of persons in incarnation at present. There are, happily, some men who have escaped fiom this delusion, and to them we owe the Ageless Wisdom which tells us we are destined to become true sons and daughters, clf the Most High, able to act as the human instruments whereby truly divine power may be brought to beirr on man's own nature, and, through that regenerated nature, on human environment and human society. -i'ire power wirich conciensed tire ptrysicai obiects is present in us aii. it works fit-rrn rirc cellier outward. The laws whereby it worLs are summarized in Tarot, and Tarot is one of several symbols of tlie Creative Pattern. We may follow this pattem so as to produce selected results. Using Tarot in this way, we establish in our field of personal snbconsciousness the particular seed ideas which are the universal basis for the fbrms we clesire to see around us. This is true theurgy. There is, of course, no intrinsic power in a Tarot Key. It is not Tarot that works. A Tarot l(ey is merely a pictorial announcement of some principle or law of life. It influences strbconsciousness because the natural language of the collective subconsciousness is pictorial imagery. Wrile you hold the image of a given I{ey in your consciousness, your subconsciousness is being impressed witli the meaning of that image. Day after day, week after week, you have given conscious attention to valious combinations of Tarot symbols. This work may lrave seemed more or less mechanical. it may be that you have not been tremendously thrilled by it. Seed-planting, after all, is not so very exciting. But, if you have stuck to your practice, you have been impressing your subconsciousness with the fundamental principles of the universal creative process. By using many clifl'erent combinations of the I(eys, you avoided the danger of specializing on those which, fbr one reason or another, you fancied, while neglecting others which, for you, lacl< superficial appeal. lfhus this course, besides aclding to your general knowledge of Tarot r /s0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TAROT' INT'1:)RPRETAT'lON 32 symbolism, has provided you with daily exercises in the employment of the subtle power of pictorial suggestion.

I-Iere let us remind you that l'arot was invented by the same Inner School which first brought the'frue and Invisible Rosicrucian Order to the notice of the erudite of Europe, early in the seventeenth r:entury. The doctrine and practice veiled by Tarot is true Rosicrucianism. It is a combination o1'the Secret Wisdom of Israel, concealed by the letter of the Olcl Testament. rvitir the Gnosis veiled in the language of the Ner,v Testament. This Gnosis is iclentical with the Gupta Vidya of India, and with the esoteric doctrine of Egypt ancl Cl-ralclea. lt is the fulfillment and perf'ection, but by no rneans the abrogation, of the ancient Hermetic Wisdorn. Hcnce rnuch of it is to be found in such fiagments as are preset'ved in THE CI{ALDEAN ORACLES and othel partial survivals of the writings of the Neo-Platonists and Neo-Pythagoreans. Traces of the same doctrine are to be found in the books of iamblichus, Plutarch and Philo. Yet another soLlrce of instruction is to be found in the books of genuine alchemists. Eiiphas Levi tells tts tliat lvithout Tarot the true meaning of these cryptic writings is undeciph.rubl., br-rt becornes plain to the persoll properly instructed in Tarot symbolism.
