The same arangement appears in the oentet of the wheel on l(ey 10, on the stars of Key 17, and is the basis of the disposition of the sun's rays on I(ey 19. This arrangement of four lines so as to form eight angles of 45 degrees is an important clue to the right use of Tarot. If we imagine such a double cross as being drawn on a table, and then place eight Tarot I(eys at the extremities of the lines, and a ninth Key at the center, we shall fbrm a combination of syrnbols which has power to bring out meanings of the I(eys which would not be so evident were the pictures to be considered separately. Wren we do this, we do not select our Keys haphazard. A definite mathematical principle is involved, so that every alTangement of nine pictures expresses a ceftain numerical order. The total number of such combinations is 1 12. At the end of this course, you will be given a table showing them all. Until then, you will work with a single group of nine Keys in each lesson. Twenty-two combinations have been chosen for your preliminary studies. They have been selected with an eye to the underlying intention of this course of lessons. The main purpose of TAROT INTERPRETATION is to enable you to experience that transforming change of consciousness which will awaken you to arealization of things as they are. Thus we have selected for your study and practice those groups of Keys which are best adapted to bring about this result. We shall beein with this combination: Yon will see that lines drawn through the central number, 4, from 0 to 8, 7 to 7 ,2 to 6 and 3 to 5 will make the double cross rnentioned in the first paragraph of this lesson.

From a consicleration of this little tableau it therefore becomes evident that the Emperor represents the agency through which the hidden force symbolized by the Fool is manifested as the control of the animal nature typified by Strength. He stands also for the means whereby the self-consciousness represented by the Magician is brought to the state of perfect mastery pictured by the Chariot. I{e is likewise a symbol of that function of human life whereby memory is utilized to establish the balance of consciousness and subconsciousness. T'his is one of the indications of 4, considered as the mean terrn between 2 and 6. the numbers of the l-Iish Priestess and the Lovels. Finally, we may think of the Emperor as being the agency whereby the creative imagination represented by the Empress takes fbrm as the intuitive perception of truth symbolized by the Hierophant. You have already learned that Sight is the function typified by the Emperor. This applies to mental as well as to pl-rysical vision. It is associated with the Constituting Intelligence because Ageless Wisdom teaches us that the power which makes, frames and composes the rlrriveyse. and regr-rlal-es all its actirrities. is apotverof the One ldentity. analogous tc yision. The Life-power sees the universe into existence. Its vision is perfect. and when we see as it sees, we ourselves behold a perfect creation. Nor is this melely a metaphysical perception. He who, here on earth, sees eye to eye with the Creative Mind, shares that Mind's power to control the forces of nature as they manifest themselves on the physical plane. This is the secret of the worlcs of power which characterize the lives of seers and sases. Perfect mental vision is perfect reason. The brain of man is an instrument perfected by the Life-power for the expression of that vision. Thus the sign Aries, governing the head of man, is associated with the Ernperor. Through the clear vision formulated in man's brain, the hidden folce symbolized by the Fool is transferred to the region occultly termed the heart, ruled by Leo, the sign corresponding to Key 8. To the degree that order and right ffreasurement (a) are established, to that degree will the limitless energy of the Life-power (0) be expressed in the perfect rhythm of all the subconscious activities of personal life. When such rhythms are established, the result is mastely, represented by l(ey 8. Right watchfulness, or conoentration, is pictured by l(ey l. This is indispensable to personal exercise of true vision. 'fhe lbllies o1'the scholastic era demonstrate how barren reason can be r-1s0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"T A }IO 7' I N T E ]?

The characters inscribed on the Book of Nature are plain enough, but we must learn to read them before we can understand what they have to say. Thus, when we consider the Ernperor as being the connecting link between the Magician and tlie Chariot, we are reminded that vivid awareness of what is actually going on, moment by moment, is a prime characteristic of all masters of life. This is what fills their speech and writing with vivid imagery. They see the perfect law at work in the most lamiliar things. They see it here and now. Thus they teach by means of parables, for they know that the meaning of existence is to be found in the events of every clay, that the great secrets are hidden in plain sight, that the laws of life are exemplified continually in the aftairs of men. When we see this as they see it, when we share their vision, we perceive that this moment is the moment of peace and victory pictured by the Chariot. We see that in very truth NOW is the acceptable time. Then it will be evident to us that the words of THE PATTERN are true when it says, \"Mine is the victorious life.\" Memory also enters into the Divine Wisdom. The Life-power's record of past experiences is coiriplete. l.loi.hiiig escapes it, .riid tlrlougli tiic Unitirig ilteiiigencc synrboiizeii by iiey 2, every personal center of the Life-power is indissolubly linked to the Mind which never forgets. Our personal memories are but words and sentences of the cosmic memory record. Yet, since they are part of that record, they are also related to, and associated with, the whole story written on the scroll of the High Priestess. As we persist in right watchfulness, so that we attend to the infinitely rich and varied experience which comes to us moment by moment, our personal memory record becomes clear, and subconscious processes of association link it up with cosmic records. Thus we begin to see things in their true relationships, and we estimate every experience at its proper value. It is not long befbre this results in the harmonization and co-oldination of our subconsciousness with or.rr conscious awareness. Thus, by mental vision of the rneaning of past events, we colne to understand the interaction of self-conscious activities with subconscious life, and the relation of both to superconsciousness, shown by Key 6. Then rve begin to enjoy the beneficent results of creative imagination as pictured by the Empress, for when we reason correctly, subconsciousness is impregnated with our right estitnates of the meauing of experience. Our day-to-day observations of life thus become the seeds of intuition and revelation.

But uutil we have learned to set our mental house in order, rve cannot put ourselves in a proper position to hear what the Ilierophant has to tell us. Today's intuitions are the fruit of yesterday's clear vision. The Inner Voice is really the voice of the Emperor who assumes the office of the Ilierophant when occasion arises. Hierophant and Emperor are not two, but one. The Emperor is the Divine Reason taking the measure of the outer world of time and space. T'he Hierophant is thzrt same Divine Reason conveying to us the eternal significance behind these outer appearances. Psychologically, intuition is the subconscious process of deduction applied to the elaboration of the meaning of our conscious estimates of experience. Thus true intuition is a consequence of riglrt reasoning, and they who are too careless to watch, and too lazy to reason, never hear the Inner Voice. Now look at your combination of I(eys again. This time you will notice that in addition to the Ibr-rr pairs of cards related to the central Key there are also two other groups---0, I, ) and 6, 7 , 8-which have the peculiarity that the middle card is the mean arithmetical term between the other two.
