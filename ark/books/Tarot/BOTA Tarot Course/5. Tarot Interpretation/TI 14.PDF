I 4 \"By adding each of the columns of these squares, you will obtain invariably the characteristic number of the planet, and, finding the explanation of this number by the hieroglyphs of the T:uot. yon proceed to seek the sense of all the {igures . . The result of this operation will be er complete and profound acquaintance with all the allegories and mysteries concealed by the ancients rmder the symbol of each planet, or rather of each personification of the influences, celestial or terrestrial, upon all the events of lit-e.\" (Ritual of Transcendental Magic, CTTAPTER 2.) As usual, Levi wrote one thing here fbr the instructed and another for the uninitiated. What he left out of his explanation is that only two planets have magic squares which can be represented by Talot Keys. These are the planets Saturn and Jupiter. A magic square of Saturn contains nine numbers, and a magic square of'Jupiter has sixteen numbers. In a square of Mars there are twenty-five numbers; a square of the Sun includes thirty-six; a square of Venus has fbrty-nine; a square of Mercury numbers sixty-lbur; and a scluare of the Moon includes eighty-one. Since there are only tweuty-two Tarot i(eys, no magic square containing more than sixteen numbers can be formed with these I(eys. You r,vill get next to nothing fiom this information unless you put the l(eys before you in the positions indicated. Then, instead of tryine consciously to puzzle out what they mean, simply let your eyes take in what they see. When you get the knack of this, you will find your mind has a tendency toward a state resembling a brown study, or reverie. All at onoe, while you sit looking at the Keys there will be an uprush of perception. Not always a perception of what the Tarot combination, as a grollp of symbols signifies, or anything of that sort, but often you will find that your mind seerns to come alive in some particular way. An idea flashes out. Record it immediately in your notcbook. This prevents loss of many treasures. Following the regular course of this instruction, the groups of I(eys selected for this lesson are'. 4,8, 12; 5,8, l1; 6,8, l0; 7,8,9; 4,5,6; and 10, Il,I2. Thesewillbeusedin connection with thc dailv meditations. The fact that subhuman lbrces of nature are at all tirnes under the full domination of human subconsciousness is the great secret of practical occultism represented by I(ey 8. Remember, this control is a present reality no matter what appearances may be. Even though subhuman forces appear to act adversely, their reaction is an automatic response to states of your strbconsciousness. Change the latter and the reactions change also. fhis larv of subconsciousness . . . that everything below the level of human life expression reacts automatically to human subconscious states . . . is the secret of our power over"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1'.1RO7' INT'Iiltp l?ti7't't t oN t'/ conditions. The character of our human subconscious states is determined by the quality of our reasoning. When we reason correctly, so that our estimates of external conditions and of our relation to them, conform to the universal Constituting Intelligence symbolized by the Emperor, then forces which have seemed inimical are transformed into allies. 'fhis perception does not lead to our giving up action or the responsibility to act. It does not result in quietism. It involves no loss of interest in life. It does not ntake us withdraw fiom active participation in human affairs. On the contrary, it malces onr days more interesting than before, atrd we find ourselves accomplishir:g f'ar more with less effort than we did when we supposed we had it all to do ourselves. No matter how long you have been trying to do tliings the wrong way, the whole course of nature begins to work in your favor as soon as you begin letting things be done the right way. It stays in your favor, just as long as you retain the right mental attitude. (I(eys 4,8, I2). To maintain the right attitude becomes much easier when you have accustomed yourself to listen regularly to the Inner Voice. The more often you takc your problems to the Hierclphant, the sooner will you beoome vividly aware of his guidance. Take the little problems as well as the big ones. Build up in your mind, by repeated practice, a confident expectation of being guided aright in all things. lnsteaci of running to iruman beings lor acivice, seek the counsel of the Great'l'eacher. Yon will be delighted to find how quickly the response comes, \"In quietness and confidence shall be your strength,\" is absolutely true. Invariably obey what the Inner Voice suggests, and even the most threatening appearances of antagonism will be transformed into actual aids to yollr progress and to the reahzatronof your desires. You will find yourself gaining continually in poise as your faith in the Intelligence behind all manifestation deepens through your daily contact with it. Don't wait for great occasions. Don't wait until you are in serious diff,rculties. Seek guidance always, even when you think you know what to do. When you think you know, it is always better to ask the Inner Voice whether ot not yottr own view is correct. You will be surprised at first to find that this l'rrocedure often gives you a second thought far better than your first opinion, One of the commonest reasons for apparent failure to demonstrate is that we try to \"go it alone.\" By so doing we slip back into the old error that we are living of and by ourselves. Thus the habit of seeking confirmation or coffection from the lnner 'Ieacher, tlie habit of ashing simply, \"Am I right about this'?\" and then acting in accord with the decision of the Inner Voice, even when it says \"No,\" is a habit which makes for success in all sorts of demonstration.

The ever changing flow of circumstances which seem to pass through one's field of cxperience no longer sweep one away by this or that condition. This is difficult to describe. 'fhough the wheel turns, one does not turn with it. And we become aware that its turnins works out for good. (Keys 6, 8, 10). Similarly, our vivid awareness that human personality is but a vehicle for the cosmic lifb has a tremendotts tlansforming power at subconscious levels. For what is shown in Key 7 is, in one respect, the idea that the true Self is even now all that our hearts desire. It therefore has now, and does now, all that we desire to have and do. When this idea takes full possession of us, it becomes evident that nothing whatever in nature cau be iuimical to us. Note that when this idea becomes evident to us at the conscious level of our thouglrt and speech, it is automatically transmitted to subconsciousness by way of the memory record. (l(eys 7 ,8,9). Right reasoning coucerning the place of personality in its relation to the superconscious life results in the awakening of the inner healing rvhich puts us in touch with the Hierophant. When we nleasure correctly our place in the cosmic order, the right reasoning is transmitted to subconsciousness. The latter responds to it with changes in the organism which enable us to bccorne aware of higher levels of our inner being. Then we hear internally. Wren we obey r.vlrat rve thus hear, we establish a balance and harmony between the conscious and subconscious ol1 the one hand, and the superconscious on the other. The superconscious state, as we kt.tow, is a level of life and expression above that which is enjoyed by the human personality. this is shown by the Lovers. (l(eys 4, 5, 6). Our arvareness of the true relation of personality to the cosmic order enables us to realize that these personal activities are all really phases or aspects of a universal process. As we deepen our awareness of this truth, our faith grows and we become ever more confident that Divine Justice is at work in the utter self-surrender pictured by the Hanged Man. (Keys 10, I l, l2).
