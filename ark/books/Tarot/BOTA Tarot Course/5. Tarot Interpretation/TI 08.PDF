From here on you u,ill learn how to use the'Iarot I(eys fol the purpose of realizing your heart's clesire. We assnme that your heart's desire involves no conflict with the rights and happiness of others. Surely you have the good sense to know tlrat nothing in tnre occultisrn will enable yor-r to gain any tricky advantage over another human being. Your previous stuclies have taught you the folly of expectir:rg something for nothing. Remember always that it is impossible to curploy the higher Ibrces for any br\"rt riglrt ends. All that a blacl< magician ever accomplishes is his own downlbll, his own rnental and physical deterioration. Selfish personal motives are titemselves enough to debar him who harbors them fi'orn making any use of subtle spilitual energy. Selfishness clouds the mind so that it cannot perceive the true import of the instruction. Ilou,ever clear the teaching, he who would misuse it is snre to misunderstand it. Ignorance cannot empioy powers reserveci lor tire expression of wisclom. Stuciy anci practice ers nrucir as he may, he who intends to use Ageless Wisdom to ftlrther iris own interests at the expense of another will meet with nothing but disappointment. Consider well your motives, therefore, and make up your rnind what you want to be, and what you want to do, more than anything else. See yourself engagecl in the kinds of action apprclpriate to the expression of your heart's clesire. Make your mental images clear and clefinite, You cannot be too specific. Vivid imagery like this will, naturally, inclucle all necessary details concerning the means or instrumentalities you need in order to carry out your action. Set your mental stage with scenery appropriate to the best possible realization of your desire. Yet remember that to see yorrrself having what you now suppose you need is far less important than to see yourself cloing what you want to do. Pay no attention whatever to any who would persnade you that you need clnly hold fast to the essential iclea of your main purpose. This may sound well, but it won't work. Certainly you must have a definitc iclea, a central motive. 'fhis is indispensable, but if you are to experience anything like full rcalizzttion, the idea must be clothed with specilic mental imagery."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T A R O T' I N 7- E IIP R EI' A 7' I O N : We shall assllme, then, that you know what you want and that you are ready to devote yourself udrolehearteclly to the realization of your aim. Now fix firmly itr mind the followi'e plinciple which is lundamental to this whole course of instruction: I{EALIZA'fION IS A STA'|E OF COI{SCIOUSNESS: I'f IS THE ILLUMINED PEIICEpTION OF THINGS AS TIIEY ARE, SUPPI.ANTING ]'IIE DELUDED ACCEPTANCE OF THINGS AS TIJEY I-OOK. 'l'he twenty-two Talot l(eys were designed to bring about the needed change in consciousness to make tlris realization possible. They were invented by adepts tn realization. They represent the fundamental states of human consciousness as expressed in the thogght of illuminated men and worlen. FIe who impresses their symbols deeply upon his brain cells plants within himself the seeds of illumined realization. For him are confirmed the worcls of Eliphas Levi: \"'fhe farot is a bool< rvliich is the sutn of all the scienoes, which can resolve all problems by its infinite colnbinations, which speaks by evoking thought, and is the inspirer and regulator of ail possible conceptions.\" 'l'he first page of this tnagical book pictures the hidden force which is at work in the process o{'realization. Your previotts studies have given you some idea of the meanilg of I(ey 0. l'he clegree of your sLlccess in doing r,vhat you want to do will be measured strictly by your ttnclerstaucling of its deeper significance. lt sums up what the wisest of men have learned, abottt tire One Energy .Oehind all appearances. lt tells 5,e11what they knou,. It also tells you rvhat they clo not know. 'l-he firrce r,vhich makes possible the realization of your heart's desire is occult because it is hidden liom the ignorant. Among the oldest books in the world are those written by 're' who ttnderstood and used it. In this dawn of a New Age, a greater ntulber of persons are ready to assitnilate ar-rd apply this ancient knowledge; br,rt even today prepared minds are in the minority. Yet fi'om that minority are chosen the real, though hidden, masters of the world. No wise man pretends to know the irurermost nature of this hidden force. None pretends to dcfine tt. L,ao-tze says of it: \"The TAO whicir is the subject of discussion is not the true Tao; the quality which can be namecl is not its true attribute.', OccLrlt names lbr it are mereiy convenient designations, identilying labels. We do not know .just what it is any more than we know just what electricity is, ancl nobocly neecls to know! The wise, therefbre, avoid all useless quest in this direction. Unl<nowableness is a concept recently accepted by modern science. lt applies to Absolutes which cannot be l<norvn by the finite mind. Infinity is an Absolute. Thgughts about it can be cntertained and it is somewhat extetrsively discnssed in the more recent departments of the tnathematics. Nevertheless it is an Absolute concerning which no definition in terms of anything finite can be given. 2 r.ts'030t)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"'l'/ Ii o't' I N'r L. It t, Il L 7' ..t 't' I o ^i Einstein has taught us that Absolute Space and Time are unhnowable to the human mind and hcnce uudiscoverable by experiment. But this is not to say that these and other Absolutes cannot profitably be used and dealt witli in their relative aspects. Thus Absolute Space u'hen rnoclihed by the finite concept of distance between objects, and Absolute Tirle when considered as the periodic movement of the hands of clocks, al'e concepts which we use every moment of our lives. The manifested attributes of Absolutes can and must be dealt with in hnman thought, but not the Absoiutes themselves. The hidden force mentioned above is an Absolute. it is the One Thing which is the source of all else. Tlierefore it cannot possibly be identified with any of the things which proceed frorn it. Frorn the deepest antiquity it has been recognized and designated by terms for which the English equivalent is NO-TIIING. Of this No-Tliing the zero sign is a symbol. Zero also signified freedom from limitations called \"time\" and \"space,\" in their relative aspects, of course. 'fhus the Fool shows that the hidden force is always in the position suggested by the picture. lt is always at the height of its llower, yet there is always something higher beyond. It lras limitless possibilities fbr flner and better: types of rnanifestation. Let this realization sink deep into your mind: neither time nor space can bind the hiclden force. It is always pelfectly fiee, nor can any condition limit its free sell.expression. Being boundless, it is necessarily present. \"All the power that ever was or will be is here no\\ry.\" Its energy, rnanifbsted as the light of stars, maintains itself without the sliglrtest loss tlrrough millions of light-years, and propagates itself without deviation through reaches of sp.rce whose immensity staggers our imaginations. Where anything is, it is; ancl where nothing seems to be, there it is also. You yourself are completely filled with tl, e real presence of the hidclen fbrce. All that you are is an assemblage of manifold veils that hide it, and, by hiding it, make it \"occult.\" Your body is made of'it. It is the substance of your food and the earth beneath yonl feet, all of your possessions. This is the One Reality, manifest in all things you linow and dwelling in everything outside your present range of knowledge, also. The universe is a great ocean of vibrating electro-magnetic energy. Psychologists assure us that this energy appears as \"objects\" when its vibrations are distinguished within relatively narrow fields perceptible to our senses. If our sense organs should change a little, we should fiucl ourt selves in a new worlcl full of things unknown to us now. f'hese things actually exist, even now, tl-rough we can lbrm no clear idea of whal they ale like. Matter as a separate entity, does not exist.

The primal pliysical form of this energy is light, or radiation, and everything else is made of this radiation. l his is the substance of what is now taught by such leaclers of modern science as Edclington, Jeans and Millikan. What they advance in their latest books has a familiar ring to students versed in the lore of Ageless Wisdom. \"Light is the veil of the Boundless, and all things are from that Light,,' says thc Inner School of Western occultism that invented Tarot. \"That which hath been made was lil'e in the Creative'fhought, and the iife r,vas the light,\" is the declaration at the beginning of the Gospel accorcling to St. iohn. This living light is often given a narle which means \"Life-Breath.\" The term is no figure of speech. Our atmosphere is really made of iight. I'he atoms of its gases are built up of electrons, themselves points of radiant energy. Every electron is a point at which li1es of magtletic force converge. Their convergence sets up whirling motion at the electronic point. 'I'his whirling motion is represented by the ten 5'ellow wheels on the Fool,s dress. In proportion to their size, electrons are as far apart as are the stars. Thus the active units of cllerg-v in the universe, tire electrons. are separated by relatively vast expanses of apparently crnpty space. Dwell otr this iclea 1'or arvhile. It will help you overcorne one great obstacle to realization, namely the notiou that because the things of the physical plaue seem hard and solicl to ou1 scnses they offer resistance to the passage of the hidden force. Think of radio waves, bringilg tnusic fiom distant stations iuto your home through solid walls. 'Ihink of cosmic rays, penetrating many feet of \"solid\" lead. fhere are finer vibrations than these to the action of uftich nothing physical can oppose a barrier. As we read in the Emerald Tablet of Hermes: \"'lhis is the strotrg force of all forces, overcoming every subtle and penetrating every solid thing.\" Electrons, as we have said, are separated fiom one anotirer by vast expanses of apparently cmpty space. It is not really empty. Space is frlied with the Life-Breath. It is everywhere, betweeu things as well as in thern. T'hey rnay be small as electrons or big as Betelgeuse, but things are limited areas or fields wherein the occult force takes on physical form. All things are \\vaves in an ocean of lisht. '[he earth is a r,vheel in a machine dliven by solar force. The movements of matter on its surface, inciuding your personal actions, are transformations of the sun's radiance.

The gale, driving storm-clouds across tiie sky, the breeze stirring the curtain, the rvild tornado cutting a swathe of death, the steady trade winds carrying proud ships on peacefirl errancls of commerce-these are phases of the influence of sunlight on our atmosphele. Every breath drawn by living creatures and every transformation of that breath into sound expresses the salxe power. Every prayer ancl every curse, every u'ord of wisdom and every tttterance of folly, is made possible by sunshine. The sluill call of bugles sounding the attack, the solemn music echoing beneath cathedral arches-these are the sunliglrt's garments of air. Every fire that burns is a flame lit and sustained by the sun. The history of human culture is the story of man's mastery of fire. Almost everything we own has passed through fire, or has been fashioned by machines driven by fire. 'fhe energy of luel is imprisoned sur-rlight. And rvhat more wonderful than the slow fire in our bodies, lit befble our birth, rvhich, while it bnrns, is life itself. Mastery of this vital flarne is one of the greatest occult secrets to be learnecl lrom your present studies. This fire takes fbrm as thor.rgl'rt tirrough the functions of your brain. Your brain itself is made of light lilie everything else. lt changes sunlight into mental imagery. l'hought at your end, the expressing end of the cosmic play of- light vibration, irnplies a mental qr-rality within the source of these \\l/aves of living light. The hidden force is life force ancl rlinct force as well as the root of all physical energies. Thus the Wisdom of Israel ascribes Fiery Intelligence to tlie letter corresponding to Key 0. During this week, memorize the following: 'Ihe character N, Aleph, is also the Hebrew number 1. In Roman letters it is transcribed as A. The letter-name lf N (ALP, Aleph) means Ox or Bull. Its numerical value is 1 1 l. The letter Aleph stands for hll (RVCh), Ruach, the Life-Breath, and for the element of air. It is the sign of the Fiery Intelligence.
