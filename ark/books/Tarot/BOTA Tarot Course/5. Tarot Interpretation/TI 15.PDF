When tire constant summation of a magic square is a number which appears on a Tarot Key, we take that I(ey as representing the main idea symbolized by the square. When the summation is greater than2l, as24,27, or 30, we add together the digits of that number, and the resulting number is that of the Tarot Key we must take as symbolizing the main idea of the whole square. Thr\"rs 24, the constant summation of the square given in Lesson 14, gives 6 as the sum of its digits, and I(ey 6 represents the main idea of that square.

Among those meanings is this: All the actions of man, all the works of human hands, are really expressions of the power of the One Identity. We do nothing of our own power because in truth we have no power of our own. No power belongs to us. We are merely agencies for the distribution and expression of the limitless spiritual energy of the universe. Our personal energies are governed by the Law of Response. We do not act of ourselves. We react to impulses rising from the depths of subconsciousness; ponder well the difference in meaning between acting and reacting! In Key 9, the higher impulses of the Spirit are represented by the light in the Hermit's lantern. Most people leave the power of Spirit out of their reckoning. Supposing themselves to be operating by their own energies, they limit their ideas of the power at their disposal to the forces of their own bodies and the resources of their visible possessions. They leave entirely out of account the most important part of human equipment, namely the real presence of Infinite Spirit enshrined in the temple of human personality. Because the Infinite Spirit actually dwells within us, every human being has all the limitless resources of that Spirit to draw on. The first of these resources is the omniscience of the Life-power. The Spirit dwelling within us knows everything. For it there are no problems, no veils of ignorance and darkness. yet one of our commonest asseftions is, \"I don't know.\" Lack of knowledge of what to do, of how to meet an emergency, or how to carry out some undertaking-all such forms of ignorance are purely personal defi ciencies. We can overcome them when we realize that specific knowledge adequate for our every need is always at our disposal whenever we put ourselves in a position to receive instruction from the Inner Voice. As usual with the most important things in our lives, the process is simple. We need only confess our ignorance and listen for instruction, maintaining the mental attitude of confident expectation that our listening will enable us to hear the right answer. Here the Law of Response is clearly at work. Our listening is really a conscious reaction to our knowledge that there is a Voice to instruct us. \"And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying; 'This is the way, walk ye in it.\"' (Isaiah 30:21.) For the wayshower holds always l{is light on high to illumine our path, and His voice is ever ready with wise counsel for those who obey the precepts of His instruction. This is the way which leads, through the full fi'uition of our inherent potentialities, to release even from the bondage of death. (i(eys 5, 9,13)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION: Remember, the power of Inf,rnite Spirit enters your life through two channels . . . the activities of your conscious and subconscious minds. Your conscious thinking, feeling, planning and desiring are as truly expressions of the Life-power as are the wonderful resources of your subconsciousness. The Life-power is the energy expressed in all your voluntary actions just as truly as it is the source of your involuntary activities. However, subconsciousness is the channel through which you make contact with the superconscious levels of the Life-power's activity. Youl conscious rnind cannot bear the dazzling light of superconscious mental activity, but must receive that light in a form tempered and modified by its passage through subconsciousness. Yet it is only when you have released subconsciousness from being dominated by the conscious mind that you get the best results. This is the removal of the curse of Eve to whom it was said: \"Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\" The curse, however, is not removed by any process designed to let subconsciousness dominate self-consciousness. Many plausible theories have been advanced to the effect that all human difficulties are due to restrictions put upon the free play of subconsciousness. We hear much talk about the evils of inhibitions put upon subconsciousness by the self-conscious mind; but the lact is that were it not for this power of inhibition we should all be mad. Subconsciousness is incompetent to act as the directing agency in human life, but it is able to act as a channel thlough which the actual and higher directive power may be brought to bear on us. 'l'o take advantage of this, we need only say to subconsciousness something like this: \"I recognrze your function as agent for the influx of the limitless resources of superconsciousness into my personal life. I renounce all dominance over your activities and turn over your entire operation to the guidance of Infinite Spirit. I{enceforth you shall not be subject to me nor to my partial knowledge of the Way of Life. From now on you shall be an open channel through which the limitless potencies of tlie Life-power shall flow into the field of my personal consciousness. You are under the Life-power's all-wise direction. Reject all suggestions of error which may result from my partial knowledge.\" To say this is really to put one's whole existence at the disposal of the Universal Life. It is to surrencler completely and confidently every detail of one's affairs to the wise guidance of Universal Being. (I(eys 6,9,12) 'fhere are two ways of looking at Infinite Spirit. One is expressed by the noun \"immanence\" and is represented by l(ey 7 wliich shows Infinite Spirit as the ever-victorious rider in the veiricle of human personality. The other is expressed by the noun \"Transcendence\" and is syrnbolized by i(ey 9 which shows lnfinite Spirit as a power dwelling far above the level of human personality. Yet these two ideas are not mutually exclusive. The Life-Power is above and beyond all we know or experience at the personal level. There is no manifestation of energy which is not dependent on it. l5"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7'AROT INTERPRETATION: l5 Yet this very quality of omnipresence makes the immanence of Spirit inevitable. Since there is nowhere that it is not, it must be here and everywhere. The Master of our destinies is with us always. 'fhus all the resources of the Infinite are truly at hand for every one of us, and atall times. Since we have already seen that subconsciousness is the channel by means of which the powers of Spirit enter the field of human personality, it follows that subconsciousness is the means whereby circumstances are now perfectly adjusted. All appearances of iniustice and unbalance are due to our imperfect personal knowledge. Relatively, of oourse, there are what we call maladjustments such as poverty, misery, or ill-health. Ageless Wisdom declares that all these painful limitations are educative. pain prods us into search for release from suffering. As Henry Wood used to say, \"Pain is friendly.\" Even when we are not yet sufficiently skilled in our application of the laws of life to be surrounded by the outward evidences of success, it is profitable to state: \"I recognize tlre manifestation of the undeviating Justice in all the circumstances of my life.\" (Key s 7,9, I l) Ageless Wisdom declares also that all subhuman phases of the Life-Power's activity are always under the control of the human manifestations of subconsciousness. By sub-human, we mean all those energies called by Qabalists the \"vital\" or \"animal soul\" which human subconsciollsrrâ‚¬ss shares with all life below the human levels. We cio not have to bring these energies under control. They are continually under control. The responses of subhuman levels always reflect our subconscious mental states. They cannot do otherwise. Even when they seem to be most adverse to us and to our aspirations, they are simply responding to the actual states of our own consciousness. If we change our mental states, the responses will also change. From the moment we begin to rcahze that our lives are under the guidance of Infinite Spirit, all those subhuman phases of life-expression which constitute our environmental conditions, will begin to reflect this realizatron lt will appear to ourselves and others that things have begun to work for us instead of against us. What really occurs is that we have identified ourselves with the integrative or up-building phases of the Lif-e-Power's action. We go with the cu*ent of the Life-Power instead of against it. By the reversal of our mental attitude, we experience what seems to be a reversal of conditions. In reality, all the sequences of the Life-power's manifestation move on just as they did before, because \"with Him there is no variableness, neither shadow of tuming.\" The change is in ourselves. (Keys g, 9, 10) The whole matter depends on our establishing the habit of listening expectantly to the Inner Voice. That Voice is not loud. It is a \"still, small voice.\" 'We rnust listen attentively before we can hear it. We must bear always in mind that harmony between the conscious and subconscious elements of our personality is brought about by releasing subconsciousness from clomination by our limited self-conscious knowledge. This release is effected by U,90300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TAROT ]NTERPRETATION. 15 deliberately surrendering ourselves to the direction of Universal Spirit. We must practice thinking of that Spirit as an immediate presence in our lives until practice has made the thouglrt second nature. We shall then be always responsive to guidance by the One Identity and our daily experience will be a demonstration of the power of that One Spirit to turn all tlrings to beautiful results. (Keys 5, 6,7) Through such practice we accustom ourselves to think of subconsciousness as the agency whereby all conditions of our lives are so adjusted as to bring a maximum of good into expression. As we become more and more habituated to this new mental attitude, we find that even the least details of our personal activity are included in the operation of the Law. Nothing is too small for the Life-Power to take care of, nor is anything too great for it to accomplish. Even the transformation of our bodies, so that our brains may register the finer types of experience which release us from bondage to the idea of death, is included in the operation of the Law. Subtle changes in function and structure are brought about so that we become consciously aware of what may be called octaves of vibration beyond the range of ordinary human experience. We can learn experimentally that we are not limited by our bodies to the extent that we seem to be. When this knowledge has been gained, the last enemy has been overcorle.

My subconsciousness is an open channel through which the limitless potencies of Universal Spirit arc at my disposal. The Hand of the Etemal leads me.
