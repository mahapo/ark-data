[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT INTERPRETATION Lesson Three After the stress and shock of sudden awakening to the error of separateness, after the lightning flash of true knowledge has toppled the crown from the tower of common sense as shown in I(ey 16, comes a period of calm, gradual growth. In the second stage of unfoldment, there is a sudden, painful overthrow of false wisdom of \"this world,\" a mornentary, yet unforgettable glimpse of reality, a quick insight into the absolute unitl'of life. In the third stage, this conception of the unity of ALL begins gradually to develop. What occuls during this development we may discover from Key 17. You will remember that this Key is related to the esoteric meaning of the letter Tzaddi, the \"fish-hook.\" To this letter is assigned the function of meditation. In astrology it corresponds to Aquarius, the sign of the Man, ruled by Saturn. Let us begin with this last detail. In Tarot, Saturn is Key 2l , the World, symbol of cosmic consciousness. In mythology, Saturn was fabled to devour his children. In occult psychology, we find cosmic consciousness swallowing up all its differentiations. As Saturn was father of the gods, so is cosmic consciousness the source whence spring all states of personal consciousness. Cosmic consciousness is not something new, though it is something we look forward to experiencing. We really go back to it, though the time when we shall do so is in the future. Persons familiar with conventional astrological interpretations of Saturn arc puzzled to find this planet represented by the gay dancer of Key 21. They think of Saturn as being a malefic, as having a constricting, confining, limiting quality. That it seems to have an unfortunate influence on worldly affairs must be admitted, but this is because ordinary worldly affairs are conducted from the point-of-view of limited, three-dimensional consciousness. The affairs of \"this world,\" and the structures of politics and economics devised to take care of these affairs. are based on a fundamental delusion. To one engaged in a vain endeavor to erect a house oflife on the lonely peak ofpersonal isolation, the influence of Saturn is truly inimical. Not so fbr one who has developed, and lives from, a consciousness of the unity of Being. Then the Saturnine force of restriction becomes a means for concentrating the Life-power into definitely desirable and beautiful forms of expression. us0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TA RO'f I N T'E RP I] ETAT I O N This aspect of Saturn's manifestation is depicted by Key 17 . It is the basis fbr the growth in wisdom characterrzing the third stage of spiritual unfoldment. For meditation, \"an unbroken llow of knowledge in a particular object,\" begins with concentration, and the act of concentration is voluntary limitation of the field of consciousness. This limitation is Saturnine in quality. Meditation is prolonged concentration. By associating it with Tzaddr, Qabalists liken meditation to a fish-hook. The analogy is good, even in its more obvious implications. Its deeper meanings are worthy of serious consideration. A fundamental assumption of Ageless Wisdom is that every center of the Life-power is related to the whole Life-power. The Many are expressions of the One. In its perfect knowledge, the One unites past, present and future. [t knows its whole self-expression and knows every part of the whole. Our personal consciousness is a specialization of this cosmic cclnsciousness, and since the Life-pou'er is omnipresent and omnipotent, nothing whatever can prevent it fiom communicating to anv one of its personal centers any detail of the knowledge possessed by it. While yet we are deluded by the illusion of separateness. it seerns to us that we, as persons, think and feel, that we have personal states of self-consciousness and subconsciousness. Except lbr comparatively brief periods of ecstasy, even the greatest sages experience the same illLrsiorr.

If -vou believe this is vour personal r.vork, if you regard the details of esoteric knowledge as being tenibll,' difficult. so that you must get them into your head by dint of arduous personal exertion, you actually increase the difhculty. Think of your study as being the work of the Life-power which aiready knows every one of these details. Remind yourself that the Life-power brings you what you can use at the nroment you most need the knowledge. You will be amazedto see what a difference this will make. To returu to the connection betrveen the letter Tzaddi, the fish-hook, and what goes on during meditation, let us remind you that the inner consciousness is oflen compared to a sea, and the various forms of knowledge to fishes swirmning in it. When we select some particular ob.ject for concentration and focus the Life-power upon it in an act of attention, we are baiting a hook and dropping it into the sea of subconsciousness. As fish are attracted by bait, so are various forms of knowledge having an affinity for the object of concentration attracted to our mental fish-hoolc. Suppose, for example, you concentrate on a Tarot I(ey. In the beginning you may not see very much, but the longer you watch, the nearer will you come to the time when some detail will be emphasized in your consciousness. trs0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AROT INTERPRETATION Then you will seem to sense the presence of a deeper meaning below the surface. Tliis is the time to land your fish. Get out your notebook and put your impressions into words. The words will come-sometimes a few, and sometimes several paragraphs. Then cast your hook again and watch until another thought-form takes the bait. Maintain the mood of expectancy. Your subconsciousness is like abay, opening into the ocean of cosmic consciousness. Thought-forms from remote reaches of that great sea will be clrawn to you by meditation. The Life-power knows just what evervthing means. It has perfect memory of every thought that has ever taken tbrm in the consciollsness of every human being. \"Nothing is hidden that shail not be revealed.\" There are no lost arts, no impenetrable secrets. Thus the Rosicrucian CONFESSIO says: \"Vy'ere it not an excellent thing so to live . . . that neither the people which dwell beyond the Ganges, nor those which live in Peru rnight be able to keep their counsels from thee? So to read in one only book, as to discern, understand and remember whatsoever in all other books (which heretofore have been, are now, and hereafter shall come out) hath been, is and shall be learned out of them?\" Meditation is the process whereby these wonders are accomplished. But',','c l:a','e qucted fi'om tl:c CO|{FESSIC for aiiotlicr rcdsoii. Ii '\"r'as publislied i;y' ilie European branch of the world-wide occult society we call the Inner School. Note that it refers to \"those beyond the Ganges,\" and \"those in Peru.\" Here is a hint that the anonymous writers who published tlie CONFESSIO in 1616 were in communication with the Himalayan Brothers \"beyond the Ganges,\" and with the strong center, located in the Andes, which had been in touch with both the Asiatic and the European groups since long before Columbus sailed to find the Indies. More than this, note that the passage begins by pointing out a rvay of life. He who lives according to this way does not break into the company of the adepts. He does not pilfer the secrets of occultism from them. He becomes the sort of person from whom they are unable to keep their counsels. His unfoidment is known to them, and they are eager to communicate to him what they know just as soon as he is ready to receive instruction. The symbol of the fish-hook, again, is a clue to something else which occurs during meditation. Every kind of mental activity has its physical accompaniments, and physical changes caused by mentai states are by no means limited to transformations of cells in the brain. To this fact the letter-name Tzaddi refers. You have learned that in Hebrew the \"fish\" is Nun, and to that letter is assigned Scorpio, the zodiacal sign governing reproduction. As a fish-hook draws fisl-r out of the water to be eaten,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAI]OT INTERPRETITION so right practice of meditation lifts up the nerve-force energizing the organs governed by Scorpio. So lifted up, this energy becomes food for the growth of the spiritual man. On this account, continence and chastity are insisted on in all books dealing with spiritual development. Many persons, however, are inclined to exaggerate these requirements. They who suppose that chastity is necessary to right meditation, or to occult development, are in error. On the contrary, the chaste life, because it is a life of repression, is a hindrance to spiritual unfoldment. The Bible contains accounts of men who ripened into the higher consciousness, and says some of them were f'athers of large families. Among our contemporaries are men and women of illumination who are by no means chaste. Clean living and control are indispensable. Control, however, implies right use. not suppression. Until seekers for light come into possession of right knowledge concerning the functions of sex, there will continue to be more or less acceptance of false doctrines. This is not the place to elaborate on this theme. They who are readl' for more light rvill find it if they but fix in mind two points: first, that the sex-force has other Llses tiran reproduction; second, that its misuse may consist either in employing it for mere sense pleasure. or else in repressing it because it is supposed to be inimical to spiritual grouth. The third stage of unfoldment, t-hough it makes use of, and modifies, the nen,e-force ordinarily employed in the sex-function, has nothing to do with that function itself. Right rneditation releases and lifts up the \"serpent-power,'' Ifundalini. stored in a center at the base of the spine. This center conesponds to what yoga philosophy calls the Muladltara chakra, or basic lotus. Modern physiologists call it the sacral plexus. In our lessons it is the \"interior star,\" Saturn, corresponding to alchemical lead. 'fhus it is connected with the planet which rules Aquarius. Meditation makes the force stored in this center rise, so that it energizes, in succession, six other centers. Three are in the trunk, one in the throat, two in the head. In l(ey 17 , the seven centers are symbolized by eight-pointed white stars surrounding a larger yellow star. The latter indicates the source of the power modihed in meditation. It is the cosmic energy, the \"stellar radiance\" or \"astral light\" mentioned by Eliphas Levi in the quotation you read in the first lesson of Seven Steps. Remember this always. You are not trying to control some power which is your personal possession. You are simply learning how to obey certain laws of a universal energy which is the Limitless Light whence all things proceed. Because the primary activity of this Light is a us0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TA RO 7- I N7' E R P RETAT I O N whirling motion, it is represented by an eight-pointed star whose rays are like the eight spokes of the Wheel of Fortune. Persons of srnall understanding bring against this teaching the accusation that by it men seek to save themselves. It is, they say, like trying to lift oneself by one's owlr bootstraps. This is untrue. Ageless Wisdom proclaims the folly of the man who thinks he can save hirnself. It tells us that, little by little, the Life-pou'er ripens its personal centers to the point where they become able to understand and appl)'the perfect law of liberty. Each person's liberation is a particular fulfillment of cosmic lau'. It is also a true work of \"grace\" because its basis is the self-impartation of the One Life to one of that Life's personal manifestations. The beginning of the way of meditation is concentration on things of the external world, on facts leported by the ph1'sical senses. The mood in which this concentration is undertaken is of great importance. Wratever obiect you select, bear in mind the truth that the Life-power already knows all about it, perceives it just as it is, and sees its true relation to other objects. Make the mind receptive to an influx of this knowledge by holding your attention to the selected object. Let your mood be expectant, a confident belief that the Life-power will impart to you just exactly the kind and amount of knowledge you can grasp and apply. As a result of this practice, you will begin to realize the unity behind the various appearances of the external world. The longer you meditate, the deeper and clearer will be your understanding of what the Wheel of Fortune symbolizes. Nothing is better as an object of meditation than one of the Tarot Keys, or some combination of l(eys. They speak a language already known to your subconsciousness, and their message teaches the unity of life. Gradually, as you continue practicing, you will begin to identifli your personal consciousness with the consciousness of nature, or the Natural Intelligence, You will begin to know that the operations of your mind are linked to the great system described by Ezekiel as being composed of wheels u,ithin wheels, that is, concentric circles of activity. Tliis realization is the beginning of your practical experience of the truth of non-separateness. Eventually, you will see that all your mental states are phases in the manifestation of the one consciousness which directs the growth of trees and grasses, the flight of insects and birds, the flow of streams and the sweep of ocean cunents. You will actually feel, flowing through your mind and body, the power which holds the stars in their courses, the power which flames from countless suns. Then you will exchange mere intellectual assent for the true knowledge which has been called the doctrine ofthe heart. u,s0s00"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TA ROT I NTE lIP RETAT ION. With this experience comes a new understanding of Mother Nature, the feminine aspect of the Life-power. This is shown by all three Tarot Keys which relate to the third stage of unfoldment. In l(eys 3 and 17, the central figure is a woman-the same woman. In Key 10, the title points to the working of the same feminine power. This is the turning wheel of Fortuna, the goddess whom the Greeks called Pantltea, in whom all the feminine deities were synthesized. She it is who makes rneditation possible. Using our mental activity, the Life- power manifests its ability to meditate, through the operation of the universal subconsciousness, the Eternal Feminine. In us She meditates when we get out of Her way. The experience of the second stage of unfoldment, the sharp flash of perception, is called the Exciting Intelligence, because it sets up subconscious responses which take forms in rneditation. in that moment, the spiritual man is conceived in the womb of subconsciousness, and the third and fourth stages of unfoldment corespond in many ways to the processes of physical gestation and bitth.
