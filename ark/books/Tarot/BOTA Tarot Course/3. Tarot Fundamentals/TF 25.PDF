[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMEI\\TALS Lesson Twentv-five Acrron-Eeurt.rBRruM \"Equilibrium is the basis of the Great Work\", says an occult maxim. This doctrine is behind all the meanings of Key 11. Consider the number itself. Its digits equal each other. Thus i I is a glyph of balance, or equilibrium. Hence it typifies equality, parity, symmetry and poise. 1 I is similar to the zodiacal sign Gemini, tr. T'he idea of equilibrium implies that of duality. Balance, says Eliphas Levi, is the result of equalizing opposing activities or forces. \"Equilibrium is the result of two tbrces, but if these were absolutely and permanently equal, equilibrium would be immobility and consequently the negation of lif'e. Movement is tire resuit of airemateri preponderanoe-wannth alter coid, mildness after severity, affection after anger-this is the secret of perpetual motion and the prolongation of power. To operate always on the same side and in the same manner is to overload one side of a balance, and the cornplete destruction of equilibrium rvill soon result. Everlasting caressing quickly engenders disgust and antipathy, in the same way that constant coldness or severity alienates and discourages affection.\" THE KYBALION states the same law thus: \"To destroy an undesirable rate of vibration, put in operation the Principle of Polarity and concentrate upon the opposite pole to that which you desire to sttppress.\" The same book gives this excellent summary of the Principle of Polarity: \"Everytlting is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\" The Hebrew letter on this I(ey is !, Larned. It means \"ox-goacl\". Thus it suggests the iclea of control combined with that of incitement. An ox-goad impels an ox to move and keeps him on the road chosen by the driver. In the Ilebrew alphabet the Ox is N, Aleph, the letter represented in Tarot by the Fool. Yet it is ttot really true that we incite the superconscious Life-power to enter into action.

On the other hand, we do seem to do both these things. What really occurs is that the Life-power directs itself by means of the functions of personal consciousness represented by the letter Larned and by Key 1 1. These functions appear to originate within us. Persons who are ignorant of the true situation suppose these activities to be peculiar to themselves, but they are mistaken. For all practical purposes, however, they who know the truth of the matter act just as if they rvere directing the Life-power. They know better, but they act \"as ili', just as a man lvho knows the sun does not revolve round the eartl-r may find it convenient to reckon the hours by the sun's apparent position in the sky. 'fhe shape of the letter Lamed is that of a serpent. It represents the same force we discussed in our study of -I'eth and Key 8. Teth is the coiled serpent, ll, Lamed, 9, is the same snake rrncoiled and active. The sign Libra is attributed to Lamecl. Its name lneans \"scales\", and this makes obvious the correspondence between this sign and the eleventh Tarot Key.

They clear the blood stream of impurities rvhich are produced by bodily action, and thus maintain the proper balance of its elements. The ruler of Libra is Venus. In Tarot, Venus is corurected witli creative irnagination. All ocoult practice calls creative irnagination into action. Books on yoga are full of exercises in mental irragery. The writings of alchemists and magicians abound in similar instruction. Modern metaphysical teachers make use of the same principle. The analytical psychologists use mental imagery in treating neuroses. Creative imagination is the fbundation of Tarot practice. Imagination builds faith. True imagination-not mere f-antasy-rests on the firm foundation of science. THE ARABIAN NIGIJTS, in their tale of the Magic Carpet, give us a fanciftrl notion of flying; bLrt fiom Leonardo da Vinci to the designers ofjet planes, true creative imagination has justified man's faith in his power to f1y. With every advance in exact knowledge, in exact weighing and measuring, creative imagination grows clearer and sees farther. Leonardo had his faith, though he never flew, and he made valuable contributions to the science of aviation. The Arabian story-teller was content with flights of fancy. I-le rendered no service to the cause ofthe conquest ofair because he had no real faith in the possibility that man rnight master that elernent.

You must have conlldence in the principles whereby you operate. You must have faith in yourself. Ilence occult schools make their pupils farniliar with the lives and achievements of adepts who have completed the Great Work. Study the lives of Jesus and Buddha. In what they said and dicl, the principles of the Great work are explained and cxemplihed. Thc planet exalted in Libra is Saturn. It represents the power of lirnitation whicli makes possible the manifestation of specific fbrms. The power of'limitation is actively at work in what Orientals call Karma. It expresses itself to us as undeviating justice. Hence the Saturn power has its highest manifestation in the Great Work which enables us to control Karma. Man can make a full and complete conquest of his future. FIe can make whatever Karma he ohooses. Some persons are so afraid of \"making bad l(anna\" that they do nothing whatever to improve the conditions in which they live. Others are afraid of \"interfering\" with Karma. l)on't woffy about that. it can't be done. You can generate fiesh l(arma, but you cannot change immutable law nor interfere with it. You tnust reap what you sow, but you may select your seeds and so determine the nature of tonrorrouls liarvest. As for today's tares among the wheat, use y,our discrimination. you can put even bad l(arrna to good use if you are ingenious. 'fhere is also the type of person who \"invites his I(arma\", and immediately begins to have all sorts of unpleasant experiences which he \"bears\" with a proper facial expression of uncomplaining rnartyrdom! What has really occurred is that he has had the silly notion that I(arma is identical with sorrow and disaster. Thus he has more or less definitely imaginecl evil fbrms of experience, and subconsoiousness has faithfully reproduced his mental pictures in the materials constitutins his environment. These self-deluded martyrs have not let loose their I(arma from a Pandora's box of afflictions in the custody of the Lords of Destiny. They have simply indulged their imaginations in making patterns of evil, and what they get is what they have made. We cannot escape from Karma because in all the universe there is no such thing as inaction, and the basic meaning of I(arma is action. 'fhe same meaning is behind the Hebrew noun translated \"Work\". 'l'his is attributed to the letter Lamed. 'the fruit of what we call \"inaction\" is loss of faculty and function, because what is not used atrophies. Yet this very loss of power is action in the wrong direction. We work as hard to fail as we do to succeed-harder, in fact. Thus Madam Blavatsky wrote: \"lnaction in a cleed of mercy is action in a deadly sin.\" U50300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'I'ARO'I FIJNDAMIiNT'AI,S. 25 The truth of the whole matter is found in the admonition: \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\" Tlris does not mean you should exert as much force in piching r,rp a pin as you would to lift a crowbar. \"With thy might\" means you must apply your whole power to whatever you do, rvhether the expencliture of energy be small or great.
