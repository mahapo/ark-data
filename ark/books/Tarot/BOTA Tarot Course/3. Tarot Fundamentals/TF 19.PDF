If you examine the form of the character, you will see that it is a conventionalized picture of a coiled serpent. The serpent is one of the most fiequently nsed, and one of the most impofiant, occult symbols. The Wise Ones employ it when they wish to compress their knowledge of the Great Magical Agent into a single emblem. The Great Magical Agent is an actual force employed every clay by everyone. lt is cosmic electricity, the LINIVERSAL lif.e- principle, the conscious energy which takes form as all existing things ancl builds them all frorn lvithin. In human personality, it is specially manifested as a subtle kind of nerve-fblce to which our Oriental brethren give the name Kundalini, \"the coiled one\". Learning to control the Magical Agent is part of the daily work of every student of Ageless Wisdom. One step toward control is to establish a clear intellectual perception of the truth that all the various lbrrns of physical cxistence are merely transfbrmatjons of-this one energy. fhe world is fr,rll of a number of things, but all are disguises for the One Thing. The essential nature of the One Thing is Spirit. The old Hebrew narle fbr the mode of consciousuess represented by the letter 'feth is \"lntelligence of the Secret of Works\". The noun translated \"works\" is sometirnes rendered as \"wages\" or \"reward\". The secret of right work is to make sure that whatever one does will bring about the intended result. What is the essence of that secret? The knowledge that the working power is the inexhaustible energy of the One Spirit. \"l do nothing of myself: the Father that dwelleth in me. he doeth the works.\" 'fhere is the secret. 'Io be absolutely sure of sllocess, we must correctly identily the worlcing power as being the One Spirit. By so doing, we rid ourselves of concern as to the outcome of our work.

Neither is it a vague, clreamy l'eelirrg that \"all will be well\". One must be specific, knowing what is intended, and fully resolvecl 1o bring about definite results. The thing to avoid is anxiety about the outcome. .Tcsus taught this plainly. The BHAGAVAD-GITA says the secret of right work is to have no attachrnent to results. Misunderstoocl by many, especially by those who have twisted it into an exolrse fbr mental haziness, this idea is perfectly sound. Moreover, it is easy to practice. T'o be anxious about the future, to be concerned about results, is to make mental images of lailure. FIe who does this concentlates on a mental pattern of what he does not want - consciously. Oflen, sad to say, this anxiety is a subconscious determination to fail. More persons fail because they really hope to than is generaliy understood. fheir will to fail is based on a subconscious f'ear that they lack power to carry their pro.lects through. Hencc to cure that fear is essential; and the cule is easily effected by seeing, first ol all, that evory one of us has at his disposal a power perf'ectly adequate to accomplish whatever we intencl to do, and whatever we are able to image clearly and definitely. When we grasp this truth, subconscious fears are dissipated, ancl with them goes the hidden will to fail. 'I'o this end, begin to think norv of evcrything as being a manif-estation of Spirit.

You will know wliat to do, and why, if you study these lessons carefully, for tlrey reveal the true secret of works. We appeal here to your good sense, and to your prudence, not to base feals. The ability to control this force may be cievelopecl easily once its nature is understood.

When the sum of a great number of small changes effects a sufircient total alteration, you will find yourself ready to awalcen the serpent power and you will know just what to clo. Why is tltis force called the serpent power? So many persolts sllppose the serpent to be erlways a symbol of evil that sorne answer to this question seems appropriate here. Most of our notions are based on a literal reading of the allegory of the Fall in the third chapter of Genesis. 'i'irere we read that the serpent was rnore subtile than any other beast of the held. (T'he field is the same field which is represented by the letter-name Cheth, which oorlesponcls to l(ey 7.) 'Ihe ordinary meaning of tlre Hebrew adjective translated subtile is \"clever, cunning, crafty, clissembling.\" Yet the same word, with different vowel-points, means \"bare, naked, uncovered.\" FIeLe is a relerence to one marked characteristic of the Great Magical Agent. It conceals the true nature of things by seeming to expose them uncovered. The Great Magical Agent is the inde{lnable something which presents itself to us under various appearallces. In every guise it seems to show itself openly without the least concealment. It has taken millenniums tor man to learn that every visible form is a veil of concealntcnt frrr a hidden tnrth. I-Ieuce it is that they who call themselves \"realists\" are, of all persons, lbrthest from having any notion of the tr:r,re lteality. For thern, ,rppearances constitute the only truth worth a montetil's consideration. [f such persons enter the field of art, they wallow in what they call \"naked trnth\", when all the time they are simply parading their familiarity with undressed lies. [Jstrally their productions are characteized by extreme emphasis on unpleasant details of appeal ances. A tntc \"realist\" is he who is not taken in by the seeming openness of extelnals. He undelstands the subtlety of tire serpent power ancl turns it to good use. For remember, the same (lenesis which tells us the serpent was the tempter includes the snake among the creatures of whoni it was said: \"And Gocl saw that it was good.\" If we are to be influenced by Scripture, we must take its whole into account and the Bible is explicit in its declaration that the law of the Lord is perl'ect, and all his works part of a success process. Ilence, throughout the history of humanity, great initiates have called themselves and their pupils \"good serpents\". The Christian admonition, \"Be ye wise as serpents\", echoes this.

'Ihis coiling, spiral, vibratory motion of the serpent power is one reason for associating it with the number 8, tbr 8 is a numeral symbol of rhythmic vibration. To u,r'ite 8, one begins at the top and describes a letter S, serpentine in form. S is also an alphabetical symbol for a hissing sound. Continuing the movement, one fbrms curves rcciprocal to those first described. Thus in writing a figure 8 we mal<e the same curved lines whicli are shown in the caduceus of I'Iermes by two intertwinecl snakes. These are also the lines of movement traced by the serpent power within the human bocly. Thus 8 in this l(ey is more than a symbol. lt is a cliagrammatic representation of the path of the serpent porver as it nlo\\/es tlrrough man's nervous system. Except 0, 8 is the only figure that can be written ol,er and over again without lifling pen fiom papcr. Thus it is a sign of endless activity. This relates B to the selpent, because snakes shed their skins, and the ancients, observing this, supposed that these animals renewed their whole organisrns also. So, liom time imrnernorial, the serpent has been a syrnbol ol'immortality and eternity. In Christian occultism, 8 is sometimes said to be the Dominical Number, ol special nurnber representing Christ. Yet it is also a symbol for the }{oly Spir:it, sometimes described as a {emininc potency. This is the leason the 8 in Key 1, and that over the head of the woman in thc Kcy' you aic stirclying no\"vv, is placed in a horizorrtal, or fenriiiinc, posi[.ion. Again, 8 syrnbolizes the ancient doctrine that all opposites are el'fects of-a single cause, and that balanced, reciprocal action and reaction betr,veen opposites results in hanlony. Some of the Pythagoreans even called 8 Harmonia. What they had in mind is a great practical secret of-Ageless Wisdom. Attr:iburtcd to l(ey 8, through the letter'l'eth, is the zodiacal sign Lco, ruled by the Sun. Astrologers say Leo governs the heart, the back, the spine and spinal cord (which is the main channcl for the bodily manit-estations of the serpent power). Among the tribes of Israel, Leo is r:epresented by the Tribe of Judah, whose standard bore a lion. 'fhe Ilebrew nalne for Leo is i1rlN, Arieh. Tl're letters of this word may be re-arranged to spell il!N''1 leaiyah, \"sight\". Sight is attributed to the letter FIeh, (i''l), and is therefbre associated with the sisn Aries. 'l'lre numeral value of each of these words, 2\\6,is the same as that of the noun l)l'1, rogaz, which may be translated \"trembling, vibration\". This noun is particularly connected with the letter Sarnekh, the sign Sagittarius, and I(ey 14. Again, 216 is 1he number of the u,ord illl!1, Geburah, Strength.

The scene in I(ey 8 is au open plain, in contrast to the r.valled city of I(ey 7. Wiat we are consiclet'ing here is the operation of a law at work everywhere in nature. In no sense is this law clependent on artificial conditions of rnan*made civilization. The law of suggestion is always in operation. lt is the primary law of subconscioustless. Every kingdom of uature is represented in this picture. The woman stands lbr the human kingdom. 'l-he lion is chief of the animal kingdom. Roses are royal flowers, and the rest of tlrc flowers, grass and trees belong to the vegetable kingdom. They grow fi'om the eadh, which is disintegrated stone, and in the background is a mountain like that in the bacl<ground of the sixth Kcy. [t completes the representation of the mineral kingdorn. 'Ihis serves to renrincl usthatall natr,rral forms andforces are expressions of the one Great N4agical Agent and are all subject to the law pictured here. 'l-he animal nature is subordinate {.o tl.re hutnan, the vegetable to the animal, the mineral to the vegetable. This control does not need to be established by auy act of ours. It is already in etTect. Yet the greater number of human beings experience the consequences of its negative operation because they do not knorv how to reap the benefits of its positive application. The clifferet'Lce between a tyro in practical occultism and a great aclept is this: the tyro has little or no knowledge of the fact that subconsciousness at the human level automatically responds to the predominant suggestions which originate at the conscious level. Hence he sets r4t activities having leactious which are negative and pain-bearing. FIis subconscious control of forces below his conscious level makes tl-rose forces take form as destructive reaction in his own body, and in the bodies of other persons. Irurthermore, this destructive reaction extends into the realms of nature below tlie animal kingdom, and the result is that the person flnds his control of subconsciousness working in reverse. fhus it comes about that everything and everybody seem to be against him. An aclept, on the contrary, knows that the subtle power of the Great Magical Agent conceals tho tt'ue nature of things by seerning to expose them uncovered. Hence he takes nothing at its iace value.

Spare no effofi to carry it out. The most rraluable lesson yoll can lcarn is that of seeing through appearances and the consequent discovcry of the One Reality veiled by them.

You'll find it rvhen yor\"r develop eyes to see. Watch l,our tongue. Don't gossip. Do not discnss the unlovable qualities of any otlrer person. Malce an effort to see the Self of all men and women you meet as perfect. Thus will you help yor-trself by telling yourself the truth about all men, and the power of your thought will bless those on whom you turn it. This exercise has far-reaching consequences which we purposely refrain from discussing now. It will be better and more interesting fbr you to fincl out for yourself .
