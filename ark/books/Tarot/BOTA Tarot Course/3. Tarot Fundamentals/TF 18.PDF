[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Eighteen THB CHARIOT Thc title of this Key is directly related to the number 7 because the Pythagoreans, whose doctrine was known to the inventors of Tarot, called 7 the vehiculum, vehicle, of man's lif'e. The syrnbolism of l{ey 7 is evidently an adaptation fiom the Pythagorean symbol; but Pythagoras probably learned it during his soiourn in India, for THE KATHOPANISHAD says: \"The Self is the rider in the chariot of the body, guided by the intellect as charioteer, drawn by the senses as powerful horses, controlled by way of the mind serving for the reins. Thus runs the vehicle over the course of experience. 'fhe Self thus conditioned by the senses and the mind is calied the Enioyer by those who know. He who is forsaken by the charioteer (intelligent discrimination) and has no idea of guiding the reins-his mind-in the proper lnanner, has no control over the senses and is like a driver of restive horses. He who has the intellect lbr his driver and the mind for proper reins, is able to reach the other end of the colrrse, the highest essence ot'the All-pervading. THA'I ever concealed in all, is never manifest, but is grasped by the sharp intellect of those who are trained to minute observation.\" This quotation ernphasizes the importance of what Tarot represents by the Magician. That I(ey is associated with Beth, the house. Hence a city is shown in the background of Key 7, to intirnate that the discriminative power of self-consciousness is behind all that is shown in the Ibreground. The buildings behind the wall of the city have towers srirmounted by triangles or pyramids. 'fhese are red. and the towers themselves are masculine, phallic symbols. 'fhe true clevelopment of Will-power? symbolized by l(ey 7, has behind it the constructive function of self'-consciousness. Our exelcise o1'this function brings about a lifting-up or sublimation of the r:eprocluctive fbrces of the physical body. 'fhis is accomplished by a release of the subconscious force analytical psychology calls libido. The wall is a stone fence. In front of it is a wind-break of trees like those growing in the Empress' garden-a living wall. l'hen comes the river, a wall of water. In the foreground is the chariot, a poftable fence, carrying a rider wearing armor, another kind of fence. Thus the Key contains repeated references to the letter Cheth (h). us'0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"'l'A RO'l' F (tN DA I/IF:N'I'A LS: I I 'fhe body of the chariot is a cube like that whereon sits the High Priestess.

From the same source comes our life-fbrce, which, as modern science demonstrates, is derived from the radiant energy of the heavenly bodies. The cycles of transformation of this radiant energy within our bodies, and in the world of physical things which constitutes our environment, cause all phenomena within range of our experience. These cycles are represented try the wheels of the chariot which refer to the symbolism of l(ey 10, associated with the planet Jupiter, exalted in Cancer. The direction East-Be1614,, sorresponding to the lower horizontal line at the rear of a cube facing an observer seated in the West, is assigned to Cheth. This is a cornbination of the clirection Relow (which is assigned to Gimel and the High Priestess) and East (which is assigned to Daleth and the Empless). fhis line of East-Below joins the lower and eastern faces of the Cube of Space mentioned in TI-IE IJOOI( Ot'' FOl{MA'l'lON. it connects the lower end of the north-east vertical line (assigned to the Emperor) and the lower end of the south-east vertical line (assigned to the IIierophant). It is opposite, and therefore complementary, to the horizontal line East-Above at the top of the cnbe. East-Above is the line at the junction of the upper face (assigned to the Magician) and the eastern face (assigned to the Empress). This line o f East-Above is the one assigned to the I-overs. Note that it connects the upper ends of the lines of the Emperor (\\lorth-East) and the Hierophant (South-East) iust as the line East-Below, assigned to the Chariot, connects the lower ends of the same two vertical lines. What is intirnated here is that the mental activities represented by I(ey 6 link together reason ancl intuition (Emperor and lJierophant) at the level of self--conscious mental activity represented by the Magician.

This is important as showing that Key 7 has to do with the vehicle of personality, built by subconsciousness. Some have suggested that Key 7 ought to be named THE CHARIOTEER, and I have myself elsewhere expressed the view that this might be a better title. On the other hand, I know of none among older versions of Tarot which call I(ey 7 anythrngbut THE CI-IARIOT, ancl, while it is foolish to valne something for no reason other than that it is old, we rnay well ask why the title of the Key has never been changed. Does it ttot seent reasonable that we may find the answer in the fact that the emphasis here is on the vehicle, considered as the portable \"House of Influence\"? Thus the body of the car is a cube, to indicate that the personal vehicle is no more than a particular shaping of the same materials which constitute its environment. These materials flow into the enclosure provided by the personal vehicle as the river in the background of the picture flows into the scene. Like the sarne river, flowing out of the picture, the various cosmic forces flow out of the personal vehicle. None remains within it. Four pillars rising fiorn the body of the chariot support a canopy. The number 4 is the number cit'.riclei aiid nicasi;ieiiieni. Ii icfei's also io ihe iuiii'cieiireiris: lire, waier, air, ealtir. Eauir pillar is divided into two equal parts reminding us of the Flermetic axiom: \"That which is above is as that which is below.\" T'he point of division at the center of each pillar is surrounded by a ring. This is a symbol of Spirit, for the rings are circles, or zero-signs. The idea symbolized is that each of the four elements is encircled by the One Spirit. 'fhe starry canopy represents the celestial forces whose descent into the physical plane through the activity of the four elements is the cause of all external manil'estation. This canopy represents the forces which surround the earth and seem to be above us in the sky. It represents also the subtle metaphysical forces which are above the level of personality. It is therel'ore a symbol for what Eliphas Levi called \"Astral Light\". (See SEVEN STEPS, Lesson l.) A shield on the face of the car has the same significance as the letter name, the wall and the windbreak of trees, the river and the chariot itself. The symbol on the shield is one form of the Flindu lingam-yoni, typifying the union of positive and negative forces. Above the shield is a variation of the winged globe of Egypt. It is gold to represent the power of the solar rays, and the wings are blue to symbolize the moisture of the atmosphere which brings these rays to earth."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'l'tl IIOT lr tlhL DA ^4 ENTALS:,/8 The crown of the charioteer is ornamented with three golden pentagrams (See Lesson l3).

'I he ricler's fair hair is bound by a green rvreath like that on the head of the Fool and having the same meaning. He is clad in armor like the Emperor. The crescents on his shoulders refer to the moon's rulership in Cancer. They are also symbols for the two aspects of the Life- power u'hich I{ebrew Wisdom calls Mercy and Severity. Hence there is a smiling face in the half-moon on the sicle of Mercy, and in the crescent on the side of Severity is a fi'owning countenance. The charioteer's cuirass, or breastplate, is greenish-yellow to simulate brass, the rnetal of Venus. It signifies the protection aftbrded by right use of the power of the Empress who carLies, you will temember, a shield as symbol of her protective function. The square on the cuirass represents orcier and purity, while the three'f's of which it is rnade up refer to the linriting power of the planet Saturn, which planet is attributed to the letter T, or Tav. The skirt below tire armor is divided into eight parts, and the units of the design are geomantic symbols used in making magicaltalismans. The belt of the charioteer suggests the zodiac.

The charioteer's scepter is surmounted by a figure 8 combined with a crescent. This is a combination of the syrnbol over the Magician's head with the lunar crown of the High Priestess. Thr-rs the charioteer's ensign of authority shows that his dominion is the result of a blending of the powers of self--consciousness and subconsciousness. Iky 7 is the end of the first row of l(eys in your tableau and is a synthesis of them all. It tells you that the chain of events leading to your ability to express Will-power starts with the Magician. Acts of attention (Key 1) set going the associative function of subconsciousness (I(ey 2), and the result is the creation of concrete mental images which externalize as definite environrnental conditions (l(ev 3). 'l'he observation and orderly correlation of the images which present themselves to us as facts iind circumstances is what we call reason (Key 4). This enables us to test our intuitions (l(ey 5) with the result that we make discriminations between the real and the unreal, and with thc further result that we become aware of the differences between self-consciousness and subconsciousness and perceive their relation to superconsciousness (Key 6). This cliscrimination, worked out by subconsciousness by way of deduction and imagination, affects the body-building activities which give us our physical vehicles. Thus we become aware of the trtte nature o1'Will-power and perceive that the One Self is the rider in every chariot of nersonalitv.

The result is that the motive-power of sensation is brought to rest, as are the sphinxes in this version, or the horses which draw the chariot in some older designs. 'Ihe sphinxes are propounders of riddles and so are the senses. By sensation we experience all thc pairs of opposites-what we like, and what we dislike; what seems to be favorable to our aims, aud what seems adverse. But when the One Self, through the intellect, gr-rides the vehicle of personality, it controls the senses, and the result is security, safety and peace-as represented by the number 7.

Though millions live and die withoLrt ever asking these two basic questions, let alone finding the answers, we must lctrow the fundamental truth about hunran personality if we would be successful practical occultists. First of all, we are not our bodies. Most of us know nothing about any body other than this physical vehicle. Some schools of occultism speak of higher bodies, etheric, astral and mental, and there is considerable evidence pointing to the actual existence of these finer vehicles. Yet, fine or gross, invisible or visible, whatever bodies we have are structures built fi'om one fundamental substance which enters into composition of all forms throughout the universe. 'I'his is that same \"stuff'which Eliphas Levi calls \"Astral Light\". In various gradations of fineness or grosslless, in various octaves of vibratory activity, this substance ettters into the composition of rvhat we call \"bodies\". Yet it is but One substance, a flowing, ever-movittg fluidic \"stuff'pictured by the river in I(ey 7. This is the \"Influence\" referred to when the consciousness symbolized by I(ey 7 is called \"The Intelligence of the House of Influence\".

The two wlreels of the car represent the cycles of cosmic activity, great and small. Ihe chariot is of stone to call attention to the word ll N, ehben, concerning which you have already had some instmction. But the rnost important clue is the shape of the car itself. It is a cube, and with this lesson yon bcgin to learn something concerning the Cube of Space. Let us impress upon you the importance of this knowledge. Though at first it may seem abstract and difficult, from it there flow innumerable practical consequences. Since the day of-Pythagoras, the cube has been a syrnbol of the physical universe. Thus the cubical shape of the car, rvhich is, remember, a symbol also of human personality, intirnates thc follclwirlg idea: The true body of man is the physical universe. By no means is it merely the localized structure of flesh and blood and bones we use during a single incarnation. One o1'the great modern physicists has written that there is a sense in which every atom and every electron is omnipresent, because it gives off radiations which ultimately travel to the utmost limits of space. He might have added that every atom and every electron is likewise a receiving station into which flow influences fiom every other point. In a measure, we have arrived at mechanical proof of this. The telephone, telegraph, radio and television enablc us to hear and/or see rvhat occltl's at the most clistant points on ealth. When I're set up the propcl conditioris, we are able to be iri corrsciousness anywirere ou this pianei, and by rneans of this extended communication we can change orlr own lives and the lives of others. By means of telescopes and other apparatus, we reach out in space to distant galaxies, and the krowledge gained has also its effect on history. Ageless Wisdom says these mechanical inventions, like all other inventions, are simply aclaptations of natural powers of the human organism. To bring otr actual omnipresence rvithin range of physical sensation, we have devised these tools, but the human body itself is a far better instrument for the same purpose. And, though experiments in extra-sensory perception are by no means complete, psychologists are beginning to accumulate in their' cautious way much evidence lbr man's virtual omnipresence, and fbr his power to inlluence things and persons distant in space. Over a period of thousands of years in the secret laboratories of the Inner School this line of research has been pursued assiduously by men and women who have given their whole lives to the study. Their accumulations of knowledge have been tabulated and checked, and many of'them have been reduced to formulas. Like the formulas of modern science, these are, in the last analysis, no more than cclnvenient symbols. -fhe symbols of a chemical lbrmula ur\" Our.r, arbitrary.

This is true because the syrnbols are part of the one uuiversal human language-a langr\"rage older than any human \"tongLle\"-and this is the occult \"speech\" which is assooiated with l(ey 7, To learn this language, we must learn to still our wagging tongues. To realize our actual omnipresence, we must stop identifying ourselves with our flesh-and-blood bodies. Before we may act magically, we must learn the art of being more receptive to the influx of power liorn higher and more interior levels. If we persist in this, the time will come when we shall know that our one body is the whole universe, and that our One Self (pictured as the Charioteer) is no other than the Living Mind which eternally creates and sustains the universe. We recommend a very simple practical exercise. Begin by sitting still, and in that stillness, use every device imagination suggests to you to deepen your consciousness that your personality is maintained by a strearn of vibrating influences flowing into it and flowing out of it. 'I'ry to see that all power is yours at every moment of your existence. Then, when your consciousness is intensified by the first part of the practice, deliberately send out the same power from your personal center, and with it bless all other forms of existence whether they seem to be friendly or hostile, known or unknown. Follow the current of energy as tt florvs ot-ttr.rard ancl. bless all things a-nd creattres gbove,vou. Fcllo.,v it again, and bless all things and creatures below. As you do this, sit facing the East, and let your third blessing f'ollow the outflowing current toward the East. Then send it in like manner to the West, to the North and to the South. [-et t'to sense of effort attend this exercise. You do not generate the current, and though some persons do shout over a telephone, be sure you do not follow their bad example. Your part is to send the message of blessing in all six directions. Blessing, because this includes every possible good-healing, harmony, peace and all eise. Begin your day with this.
