[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMEI\\TALS Lesson Nine CREATIVE IMAGINATION This week look at Key 3, the Empress, Ibr five minutes before reading the lesson. Remember that every Tarot Key is a symbolic picture of some aspect of your consciousness. All these Keys are portraits of yourself. As Eliphas Levi tells us, Tarot speaks by evoking thought-not merely intellectual activity, but all the various expressions of mind-power which externalize themselves in man's life and consciousness. Looking at the Keys is the fundamental method for bringing closer to the surface the deeper potencies of your inner life. Whenever you study one of these lessons, have always at hand the Key to which the text relates and glance at the picture as you read. Multiplication is a key-word attributed to the number 3. To multiply is to cause to increase in number, to make more by natural generation. Multiplication is the act or operation of in<;reasing by multiplying. Creative Imagination is the way the principle of multiplication manifests itself in your mental life. The secret of the process is given in that part of the definition of the number 3 which speaks of \"the response of subconsciousness to self-consciousness in the generation of mental images\". .lust as 3 is produced by the combination of I and2, so is the Empress a symbolic combination of ideas pictured by the Magician and the High Priestess. The activity resulting from the harmonious union of the forces symbolized by these two is shown by Key 3. As the sum of I and2, the number 3 is the union of the ideas of individuality (1) and repetition (2). The repetition of the unit through the agency of the duad is reproduction, and reproduction is manifested as renewal, generation, growth, fertility, developrnent and fecundity. Hence 3 is the number of production, formation, organization, propagation, elaboration.

This implies anticipation, expectation, purpose, plan, contrivance, invention. All these meanings of 3 are shown in the symbolism of the Empress because this Key typifies the working of your subconsciousness in the activities indicated by the words corresponding to the number. The Hebrew letter printed on the picture is \"1, Daleth, meaning \"door\". Originally, it was a crude drawing of the flap of a tent. Later, it carne to mean any sort of door-the leaf, not the opening. Hence it suggests power to admit or bar, to retairr or to let out. Yet in some of the developrnents of Qabalism, Daleth is also connected with the meaning of a door as a means of entrance and exit, a passageway fiom within to without. The door has been always a feminine symbol representing birth, reproduction, and the entry of life into manifestation. Some authorities, indeed, say Daleth represents the womb, the door of personal life, opening to receive the seed, closing to retain the gerrn of life during the period of gestation, and opening again to send the newborn creature into the world. Similar activities, on planes above the physical, are represented by the same syrnbol. Subconsciousness receives the seed impulse of observations made during periods of coucentrated attention. Then follows a cyole of development within the field of subconsciousness. When this cycle is completed, a new idea, or invention, or some new plan comes fbrth through the docr cf subconscicusnsss into the field of self-conscious awarcness. The form of this completed result of creative irnaginatioll may be altogether different from the fbrm taken by the original seed-thought; but the life in that form is continuous with the lif'e in the seed-thought just as the life in a human body is continuous with the life in the spermatozoon and ovum from which that body was developed. In this operation of subconsciousness there is an apparent accretion of materials round a vital center. This is as true in mental as in physical creation. ln this connection, remember that the Greek noun delta, derived from the Hebrew Daletho represents both the f'eminine organ of generation and the accretion of alluvial soil at the mouth of a river, as when we speak of the Delta of the Nile or the Delta of the Mississippi. And Delta is the name of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet corresponding to Daleth. Some think the original hieroglyphic for Daleth represented the radiance of sunrise, the entrance of light into the world through the gateway of the East. This may account for the attribution of the direction East to Daleth, and for this letter being the sign of the aspect of consciousness Qabalists name the Luminous Intelligence. Radiance is vibration produced by solar force. The sunshine is not the sun. The brightness and splendor are effects caused by the action of the luminary. His rays make the sun visible. They are his power. Hence, because the sun is one of the principal emblems of the Supreme Spirit, sunshine represents the \"Mysterious power\" of the cosmic Life-Breath-the us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7'A RO 7' F UN D A M tJ N T A LS : manifesting agency Hindus call Prakriti of which the GITA says: \"My great Prakriti is the womb into which I cast the seed; from thence is the birth of all creatures.\" Radiation of solar energy, being the basis of all vegetable and animal lif-e, is what brings about the gradual unfoldment of consciousness. It is also the cause of those physiological changes whereby a human personality manifests higher orders of consciousness. This radiant energy is also the actual physical force which assumes definite forms in your acts of creative imagination. Keep this in mind in order to intensity your feelings that you are using real powers in your occult work. In their essence: to be sure, these are purely spiritual powers. They who say there is really no such thing as a separate entity called \"matter\" are perfectly correct. On the other hand, these relative states and conditions of the manifestation of spiritual energy which constitute the field of investigation for physical science are also perfbctly real. Whatever of illusion there may be about them is in the erroneous human opinion that the physical manifestations of the Life-power are separate from the finer and subtler manifestations which are termed psychic, astral, and so on. According to the Ageless Wisdom summarized in Tarot, all forms of manifestation are expressions of a single energy which enjoys an unbroken and unbreakable continuity. This energy is real and its reality e;<tencis \"iown-r.vai'c1\" into the physical piane just as it extencis \"upward\" into realms of finer and more intense vibration. \"That which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above.\" Mental images are patterns or matrices for physical conditions. Mental objects, in their plane, have just as definite reality as physical objects. Creative imagination, represented by the Empress, is the process of internal development and arrangement which produces the external manifestation of physical conditions corresponding to mental patterns. Under ordinary conditions, the mental images are gradually precipitated into physical expression through a series of subtle transformations so slight that we cannot trace the links in the series. Those extraordinary personalities, the adepts and Masters of the lnner School, are able to speed up this series of transformations so that their mental images are manifested almost instantaneously as physical actualities. This is the secret of instantaneous healing, of such works of power as the change of water into wine, or the miracle of the loaves and frshes. Yet it must be remembered that these extraordinary manifestations are no exceptions to the general rule. For the merest tyro, as well as for the adept, mental imagery is the basis of bodily and environmental conditions. The states of body and environment which you are now experiencing are the fiuition of your mental images. If you want different external conditions, you must change the images. This is one secret of dominion.

The chaotic conditions of political and economic systems, so often observed down through the ages, are direct results of chaotic, disorderly images held in the minds of millions of human beings. To change the external state of affairs, the mental images must be changed, and to attain this desirable result (which requires that each person shall undertake the cultivation of his own mental garden) it is first of all necessary to help people to understand that outer circumstances are really the physical embodiments of pre-existent mental patterns. Among the Tarot Keys, the Empress is the symbolic statement of the harmonious and constructive direction of mental imagery. This will be more apparent next week after you have considered the meaning of the various details of the symbolism. This week, as usual, we are concerned with impressing these details on your mind as yon color the l(ey. As heretofore, plan your work so as to complete the coloring on the last day of your week's study. Thus, all week long, you wili be educating yourself by means of pictorial symbolism, the natural language of subconsciousness, and what you will be drawing forth from within will be what the Inner School l'ras learned concerning the operation of creative imagination. Such visual education is more valuable than any verbal interpretation because it calls into operation the very powers which the symbols represent. It also calls into play the wider associative power of subconsciousness whereby your mental image of the Key attr.rnes you to wise men who are fully conversant with every detail of the meaning. Regular use of the Empress will enrich your power of creative imagination and stimulate your itrventiveness. It will increase your ability to make new combinations of ideas. We live in an age when cheap printing, motion pictures, television, combined with the cut- and-dried life of our cities, endanger our power of creative imagination. We take too much of our mental imagery at second-hand, from the screen and frorn the printed page. In consequence of this, consulting psychologists and other advisers are continually asked for help in the solution of personal problems which have arisen simply because firany persons do not realize, let alone utilize, the tremendous power of imagination. Key 3 will help you use imagination positively and constructively. Through your eyes it tells your subconsciousness what powers it has and how tliey should be exercised. You may not grasp the inner meaning of the symbolism at first, but your subconsciousness will because this picture like the other Tarot Keys, is written in your subconscious mind's own language. 1t,s0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pictorial syurbolism is tl-re language of dream, of reverie, of lantasy and imagination.
