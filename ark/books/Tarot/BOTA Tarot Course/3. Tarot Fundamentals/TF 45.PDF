[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Fortv'five Cosnnc CoNscrousNnss The last card of the major Tarot I(eys, l'he World, is a symbol of cosmic consciousness, orNirvana. The central fact of this experience is that he to whom it comes has first-hand knowledge of his identity with the One Power which is the Pivot and Source of the whole cosmos. He knows also that through him the power which governs and directs the universe flows forth into manifestation. Words fail to give any adequate idea of this seventh stage of spiritual unfoldment. It must be left to your intuition to combine the suggestions of the picture with the meaning of the letter Tav (h) which is assigned to this Key. Here is a picture of what you really are and of what the cosmos really is. The universe is the Dance oiLife. The inmost, central SELF of you is the Eternal Dancer. 21 is the sum of the numbers from 0 to 6, so that, as a I(ey number in Tarot, it shows the completion or extension of the power of the principles represented by the seven l(eys from 0 to 6. Thus there is a close affrnity between Key 21 and l(ey 7, fbr as 2l is the consequence of adding the digits from 0 to 6, so 7 follows 6 in the numeral scale. Furtlrermote, we shall find that Satum is attributed to Key 21 and Saturn is the seventh of the planets known to the ancients. From Saturn's Hebrew nalne, \"Shabbathai\", we get the same meaning as from Sabbath, the day of rest or inertia and the seventh day of the week. In the Tarot tableau, lnoreover, Key 2I (3 x7 ) is placed underneath Key 14 (2x7 ), and Key 14 is placed below Key 7. Thus the principle at work in Key 21 is represented by Key 7, and the secret of l(ey 7 is beautifully explained in the following words from Light on the Path: \"Stand aside in the coming battle, and though thou fightest, be not thou the warrior. \"Look for the warrior and let him fisht in thee. \"Take his orders fbr the battle and obev them. usqt00"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TAROT'FUNDAMENTALS: 45 \"Obey him not as though he were a general, but as though he were thyself and his spoken words were the utterance of thy secret desires; for he is thyself, yet infinitely wiser and stronger than thyself. Look for him, else in the fever and hurry of the fight thou mayest pass him; and he will not know thee unless thou knowest him, If thy cry reach his listening ear, then will he fight in thee and fill tlie dull void within. And if this is so, then canst thou go through the fight cool and unwearied, standing aside and letting him battle fbr thee. Then it will be impossible lbr thee to strike one blow amiss. But if thou look not for him, if thou pass him by, then there is no safeguard for thee. Thy brain will reel, thy heart grow uncertain, and in the dust of the bafilefield thy sight and sense will fail, and thou wilt not know thy friends fiom thy enemies. \"FIe is thyself, yet thou art but finite and liable to error. He is eternal and is sure. He is eternal truth. When once he has entered thee and become thy warrior, he will never utterly deserl thee, and at the day of the great peace he will become one with thee.\" Read this quotation carefully. See how the warrior, the rider in the chariot, is identified with speech, the ftinction associated with Key 7. Furthermore, since the rider is the ONE SELF, he is also the Hierophant, associated with hearing, and in this quotation his \"listening ear\" is specilically mentioned. It is from a Master of the Western School that this gem of occult wisdom was given to us; and those who are familiar with it will recall the fact that the two sections of the text are each divided into Twenty-One numbered paragraphs, preceded by an introduction bearing no number. \"Ile is thyself.\" The quest is for the SELF. Tlie goal is the SELF. The knowledge is knor.r4edge of the SELF. The power of the infinite and eternal SELF is the only power. The SELF is the ONE, working through the mysterious, glamorous activity of reflection and duality. All this is shown by 21, the number of this last Tarot Key. 'fhe Ilebrew letter Tav means \"signature\", or \"mark\". The actual mark is a cross having four equal arms, like the one on the banner of the angel in Key 20. The Egyptian \"Tau\", corresponding to this letter, is said to have been a tally for measuring the depth of the Nile, also a square for testing right angles. Among the Hebrews, the letter Tav, written in the old alphabet as a cross like that on the breast of the High Priestess, was a sign of salvation (see Ezekiel9:4). It was a symbol for salvation from death and a signature of eternal life. As representing a signature, this letter implies security, pledge, guarantee, and so on. A signature makes a business instrument valid. Thus Tav indicates the final seal and completion of the Great Worlc, the experience which validates the hypothesis of the tJnity of Being. The great secret of the letter Tav is the point where its two lines cross. This point represents the inner center at which the One ldentity has its abode. us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS 45 'l'hus The Book of Formation says: \"The only Lord God, the faithful King, rules over all from Ilis holy habitation for ever and ever.\" And the same book indicates the place of that holy habitation thus: \"The seven double consonants are analogous to the six dimensions: Height and Depth, East and West, North and South, and the Holy Ternple that stands in the center which sustains them all.\" -l'his innermost point is in itself No-Thing, and thus The Clementine Homilies reporl St. Peter as saying: \"The Place of God is That-which-is-not.\" Yet this latter text goes on to say: \"'Ilhis, therefore, that starting from God, is boundless in every direction, must needs be the heart of Him Who is verily above all things in fashion, Who, wheresoever He be, is, as it were, in the middle of a boundless space, being the terminal of the All. Taking their origin therefore from him, the six extensions have the nature of unlimited things. Of which the one, taking its beginning fiom God, is displayed upwards toward the height, another downwards toward the depth, another to the right, another to the left, another in front, another behind . . . For at Hirn the six boundless lines do terminate, and from Him they take their boundless extension.\" Read this quotation several times. Compare it with what is said in Lesson 44 and with Figure 3 in the diagram accompanying Lesson 18. Note that the abode of God is called the heart. It is also termed \"That which-is-not\", because it has no physical form or fhshion, and might perfectly well be indicated by the zero sign which we attribute to the Fool. Yet it is by no mealls a nonentity, for this inner POINT is a positive metaphysical, or intellectual, reality. Ilence, if you can grasp the idea that this place of God, or Holy Temple that stands in the center, is necessarily everywhere, you wili see that it must be the center of your own being. Hence to Tav is assigned also the Administrative Intelligence, of which it is written: \"It is so called because it directs all the operations of the seven planets, associates their activities, and guides them all in their proper courses.\" Remember that the occult planets are the same as the interior stars mentioned in connection with I(ey 17. Remember also that each of these planets corresponds to a Hebrew double letter ancl thus to one of the six directions, as follows: Mercury, Beth, Height, I(ey 1; the Moon, Gimel, Depth, Key 2; Venus, Daleth, East, I(ey 3; Jupiter, Kaph, West, Key 10; Mars, Peh, North, Key 16; the Sun, Resh, South, I(ey 19; Saturn, Tav, the CENTER (the Holy Temple), Key 21. Thus T'av represents the point of control at the CENTER or heart. Not the physical organ, uuclerstand, but heart in the sense of \"midst, inmost core\". To get at the heart of your personal existence is to enter the Palace of the King. There the ONE SELF is enthroned. There the Lord of the Universe has His abode.
