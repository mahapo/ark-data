[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FT'NDAMENTALS Lesson Thirty-seven ItEvtrLATION 'fhc third stage of spiritual unfoldment represented by Tarot is Revelation. Revelation is unveiling, disclosure, discovery. Tl-re discovery is not made by the seeker for truth. It is made to hint. I'le receives the revelation. He does not lifl the veil of Isis. She unveils herself. Thus l(ey 17 pictures something which operates from above the level of human personal conscioLlsness. Disclosures made at this stage are not perceived by the physical senses. They are not conclusions reached by the reasoning mind as a consequence of observing externals. On the contrary, these revelations come wten the reasoning r-nind is completely stilled and the senses se aled. 'l-zaddt (I) is the Hebrew letter assigned to Key 17. Its name means \"fish-hook\". A fish-hook is a symbol for angling. Hence it is related to our ideas of experimentation, quest and research. 'fhe quest is for something not yet definitely realized. It is a groping, a feeling one's way, a \"fishing\" fbr something. Thus the symbol of a fish-hook stands for an agency or instrumentality wliereby one endeavors to solve problems or enigmas. It typifies a means for ciiscovering secrets, or a method whcreby one fbllows a clue leading to the understanding of a mystery. Meditation is this agency symbolized by a fish-hook. The Qabalistic BOOK OF F'ORMATION attributes this activity to Tzaddi and the Hebrew verb (not found in the Bible, bttt occrrring often in Rabbinical writing) means to think, to speculateo to f'ancy. Like the Ilnglish word contemplate, it implies the marliing out of a field of obseruation, limited in extent, wherein the whole force of attention may be brought to bear on some obiect of thourght. Patanjali dehnes meditation as \"an unbroken tlow of knowledge on a particular object\". We shali see that the symbolisrn of I(ey l7 agrees with this definition. Meditation is close, I)503A0"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7'l ltOT' I\" IlN l)A Al l:.N7'ALS: 37 continued thought. It is dwelling on one central idea, a diving down into the depths of the rnincl lor the valious associations connected with the main thought-that is, fishing for truth. You will note that such associations of ideas are the basis of Tarot practice. Yon will find this carricd out even turther when, later on, you come to the detailed study of Qabalistic correspondences and the Tree ofLife. I(eys 1 ,2 and 3 symbolize the fundamentals of the process. First, the selection of some clefinite object on which attention is fixed (Key 1). Second, the associative activity represented by the meaning of the letter Gimel (Key 2). fhird, the development of mental imagery, the basis of true understanding (Key 3). These are the mental aspects of the meditative process. What should not be overlooked is that nreditation has specific physical results, and employs physical energy in the organism of the person who engages in meclitation. 'l'he letter-name Tzadcli, \"fish-hook\", gives a hint as to tiris physical part of meditation, because \"fish\" is represented by the letter Nun and the idea \"hook\" by the letter Vav. Note also that in l'lJ the letters I and '1, Nun and Vav, are combined. The letter Nun, represented bv Key 13, is associated with the sign Scorpio and with the secret force governed by that sign. The letter Vav, represented by I(ey 5, is linlced with the sign Taurus. These two are opposite, but cornplementary, signs. T'he centers corresponding to them in the human body are also opposite and complementary. In meditation, the force u4rich expresses itself through the Scolpio field o1'the human body is raised and bccomes active in the Taurus region whicli includes the healing centers in the brain. Tlre resulting stimulation of these centers enables one to become aware of the Inner Voice represented by the Hierophant. The l-Iierophant is the Reveaier, and Key 17 is a symbol of the Revelation which is made by the Inner Teacher through the Inner Voice. 'fhe numeral value of the character l, Tzaddi, is 90. This is also the value of the word Erb, Mem, the name of the letter symbolized by Key 12,tl'te I{anged Man. The numeral correspondence indicates a relation between the two letters and the ideas they represent. Even in the meaning of the letter-names we call see this. Certainly, a fish-hook makes one think of water, since it is an instrument for lifting fish out of the water. Water, you will remen:Lber, is the occult name fbr the universal subconsciousness, the Great Sea in which all things have theil origin. Again, the title of Key 12 is synonymous with \"The Suspended Mind\", and signifies the suspension of the activity of personal consciousness as a result of profound meditation.

Note, itt passing, that a fish-hook is usually suspended frorn a line, so that the fact that it hargs fi'om something is what makes it usefirl. In rneditation, by lreeping the streaur of'conscionsness flowing in relation to some particular object, we gather impression after impression from that object. We become identifiecl with it. Thus we become aware of the object's inner nature. It reveais itself to us. 'I-he object of meditation is usually some sort of problem. Just as one must have the right sort ol'bait to induce f-rsh to bite, so one must have a definite obiect fbr meditation. The reason for rneditating is to solve the problem. .Because it is a problem, it appears to be the adversary of the person who is meditating. It may look lil<e the Devil himselfl but a practical occultist knows this is only the first appearance and disregards it. He knows the solvcnt power of consciousness and how to apply it. 'l'he llrst thing to do is to silence the superficial activity of personal consciousness. Just as a fisherman sits quietly, so must one in meditation learn to wait patiently until the fish of tl:rouglrt takes the hooh. The hook is always a specific question. They who imagine they are incditating ri'licn tlrci'siL passivcly, ii:,itatriig a j\"iii-fish l;i thcil ritcrtial aiiiiudr: uiuttcr emptiness, are sadly mistaken. Clcrtain as it is that we ourselves do not discover truth, it is also needful for us to understand that our mental attitude must be one of active quest. We rnust rrot be content rnerely to sit still in hope of-enlightenment. Quiet we must be, but at the same tirne intent on receiving liglrt on our problem. As the poet says, we must invite the soul. In this attitude, we are able to hcar the Voice of the Hierophant and he will speak distinctly and definitely. As we become skilled in the practice of meditation, we find that all we have to do with the disclosure of new aspects of truth is the selection of a specific problem as the pivot for our rneditation. ln olcl Egypt there used to be a statue of Isis with an inscription asserting that no niortai had ever lifted her veil. This continues to be true. Yet the veil of Isis is lifted again and agaiu fbr those who are duly and truly prepared to behold the vision of her presence. Natulc cloes not hicle hersell-fi'om us. The veil r.l'hich conceals truth is the veil of human ignotance, the veil of tnan's foolish belief in his own separateness and mortality and this veil may be removed by the practice of rneditation. Tlre trumber 17 is composed of the digits 7 and 1, with 7 standing for the power which is cxpressed and 1 for the agency tlirough which that power operates. In Tarot, 7 is the Chariot, symbol of the receptivity which is so necessary for rneditation. fhe same Key is related to a { l\\0.1/10"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'t'A RO7' tt{tN DtAl DN7'A t.,\\. 37 special mode of consciousness hnown as the intelligence of the House of Influence. Something which llows down into the field of personal consciousness, when we are quiet and receptive, is active in meditation. IIe who wishes to meditate must be keenly aware that personality is only a vehicle for the Lil'e-power. He must undelstand also that the Life-power, being the Word, or Creative Speech, finds expression in all forms. ilecause the Word is actually seated in our hearls, we are able to receive its disclosures of tluth. 'fhe mental attitude symbolized in Tarot by the Magician is the means whereby truth so disclosed rnay be put into practical application. Man is the transfbrmer of his environment in accordance with his perceptions of reality. Ile is this, whether he applies his power wisely or unwisely. We are all magicians proiecting our own magic circle of'circumstance by our mcntal irnagery. When we understand this truth about ourselves and act upon it, we find release lrom every kind of bondage. 'l'he sign Acluarius, the Water-bearer, is attributed to Tzaddi and thus to I(ey 17 also. Its syrnbol is the same as one of the alchemical symbols fbr dissolution. Thus it is directly connected with ideas we have considered in our study of I(ey 13. It is clear that the latter is related to I(ey 17, because the letter Nun, represented by Key 13, means fish. in the symboiic representation of the fixeci signs of tire zodiac, in the corners of Keys l0 and 21, Aclluanr\"rs is indicated b-v the Man. Man is the great fisirer for new forms of truth. He is the possessol of the Universal Solvent described in aichernical books. The Universal Solvent is human consciousness, concentrated and dilected in meditation. By means of this, man may solve every one of lris problems. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus and Saturn. These two planets are represented by the first and last I(eys of Tarot. Uranus is the Fool and Saturn is the World. Here is a hint that the practice o1'meditation will eventually find answers to every question from the most abstract to the most concrete. Many other ideas are connected with this co-rulership of Aquarius. Seek to discover them in meditation. The title, the Star, refers to the universal light-energy which condenses itself into stars. It is the reality behind their physical forms. The explanation of a more recondite meaning of the title rnust be deferred to another time. 'fhis week, develop the exercise you began last week. Formulate your desires into specific problems. Focus upon them the spotlight of your consciousness. Make every detail clear and dcfinite. 'fhen, with this as a basis, begin the fishing process of meditation. Do t-tot tly to think about your problem's possible solution. Rather let the stream of cottsciousness flow, as it were, past your point of observation. Watch the ideas which seem to rise to the surface of thernselves. Reject them unless they show some definite relation to the oentral idea of your meditation. Keep your object always in view.
