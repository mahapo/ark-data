[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FLII{DAMENTALS Lesson One THn OSTncTIvES OF TAROT PRACTICE You have undoubtedly thouglrt a great deal about your reasons for taking up B. O. T. A. work. You plobably seek to fulfil your desire for spiritual advancement, mental development, physical well-being, ol perhaps all tluee. Each is highly commendable-necessary, in fact, if you are to live a normal, huppy, well-rounded life; and if you persevere in the work of B. O. T. A. you will attain them. Flowever, these are personal ends. Have you ever speculated on the objectives of this Order as a whole, on the reasons why, in the absence of a plofit-making motive, B. O. T. A. exists and seeks to tlansmit its teachings to you and your fellow-mernbers? Every tlue occult Order, such as B. O. T. A., has as its major objective the promotion of the welfare of humanity. Before any member can qualify to participate in the irurer wolk of the Older, he must have pledged himself inevocably to do all in his power to promote that welfare. The great Masters of Wisdom, from whom flow the inspiration and spiritual irnpetus of this work, refuse to have anything to do with any Ordel which fails to recognize the primary importance of this great objective, for they devote all their energy and influence to that end. Our conception of the meaning of \"the welfare of humanity\" is embodied in the following seven-pointed program: 1. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7. Universal Peace. Universal Political Freedorn. Universal Religious Freedom. Univelsal Education. Universal Health. Universal Prosperity. Universal Spiritual Unfoldrnent. It is the great opporlunity of all who seek the Divine Light, L. V. X., to take an active part in this essential work. Methods of taking such action form an integral part of the work of this Oldel, and you will be acquainted with them as you proceed with the instruction. We ar-e not advocating any \"isnl\" nol seeking to promote some specific economic or political system. But we are turning the powerflil light of occult klowledge upon individual and social problems, and showing what can be done by the exercise of intuition and reason.

It does so with the understanding that you rvill use these powers not only for your own good but also for the good of mankind. lndeed, this is the only way in which spiritual powers can be safely used because they destroy those who have the temerity and lack of understanding to employ them for base and selfish ends. In order to promote the welfare of humanity, we need first to look to the units of which humanity is composed. Selfish personalities make their unhappy contribution to a selfish social structure. Chaotic thinking and immaturre emotions affect the mental and emotional levels of all humanity. We do not live unto ourselves alone. To the degree that you become a more effective unit in youl pelsonal environment, to that degree are you bringing spiritual powers into action for all humanity and preparing yourself to serve Life in ever greater measure. Dedicate yourself, therefore, to work with the Talot techniques in order to transmute your personality. A transformed personality will bring with it the ability to change your envirorunent closer to the heart's desire. Emotional and mental immaturities build patterns of frustlation in the every day life experiences. A fulfilled life becomes a positive radiating center, an effective channel tlu'ough which the Higher Self can ftlnction and a living example for othels.

Even though you may have approached this study with a measure of skepticisrn wondering how the claims made as to the effectiveness of Tarot cor\"rld be substantiated, your interest is evidence of your basic spiritual urge to seek light. This light-seeking impulse is the first requisite for success r.vith Talot. This, and a strong determination to persist in the step-by-step mastery of the details of the rvork explained in this course, will enable you to make the most of yottr study. The very fact that you are reading this lesson is proofthat you are leady for advanced thini<ing. Nothing ever occurs by accident. Ageless Wisdom teaches that when a pupil is leady, his instruction will be forthcoming. This course on TAROT FTINDAMENTALS will show you how to use the Tarot I(eys more effectively for the purpose of evoking thought. Thus you will bring to the surface of your consciousness, where you can recognize and understand them, those great principles of practical occultism which lie hidden in the hearts of all rnankind. All these principles are based on a single truth. I(nor,vledge of this tmth is innate in every human being, but not until it has been blought into the light of consciousness is it available for use. Over the portals of ancient temples, therefore, was the rnotto, \"KNOW THYSELF.\" us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TA]IOT FUNDAA4ENTALS: For the same reasor it is written: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God\", and, \"The kingdom of God is within you.\" Therefore know thyself and all else that you require will be added unto you. Rich symbolism and ingenious construction make Tarot one of the best instluments for tme occult education, that is, for drawing out the wisdorn hidden within you. The Tarot I(eys do not put something into your consciousness. They call forth what is already there. The practical instruction of this course will aid you to develop a more profound grasp of the meanings of these Keys. Into your hands will be put clues which will enable you to use Tarot in order to gain a deep working understanding of the laws of life. Follow these clues and Tarot will bring out the knowledge which is within you. . . a knowledge more important to you than ar-rything else. To each prospector in this inexhaustible mine of Ageless Wisdom, persevering study will leveal what might never be {bund by another seeker. No matter how high may be his source of infblmation, no interpreter may say truthfully: \"This is the fuIl, final meaning of Tarot.\" There can be no final explanation. No student will evel exhaust the possibilities of this extraordinary symbolic alphabet, any more than one person can exhaust the possibilities of a language. There is, however, a definite manner in which to approach the study of these Keys, even as there are tumels which lead to the hearl of a mine. In the Introduction to Tarot course you were given a birds-eye view of the teritory. In this course you will be provided with a map, or plan. Then you must enter the mine of Tarot yourself and dig out your peculiar treasure. You will begin by mastering tlie elements of the esoteric language of symbols in which the mysteries of Talot have been preserved. Every lesson of this course will enable you to make definite progress in this part of the work. Pay particular attention to evely detail of plocedure. Follow the instruction just as it is given. Wratever you are told to do, you can carry out with cleal conscience, and in the certain conviction that it will be for your good. As the results of your practice begin to make themselves manifest, you will be agreeably surprised by the changes effected in your pelsonality. You will find yourself better able to concentrate. Your perceptions will be keener. You will deepen and broaden your comprehension of yourself and of the meaning of your various experiences. u,J0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":",TAROT FUNDAA,IENTALS Mere perusal of the lessons as they corne to you will be almost useless. You might bettel save yottr time and money. Determine to devote a ccftain period to this work every day. Then you may expect the best results. \"Out of nothing, nothing cometh.\" In simple justice to yourself, prepare to enter into the spirit of Tarot practice. Do not delude yourself into believing you lack time for tliis work. it is absurd to say you have no time for what is, after all, the most important thing in your life. Your own spiritual growth is more worthy of consideration than anything else. You probably prove this every day of your life by seeking continually for greatel enlightenrnent. You read books. You talk to people. You attend lectures and meetings. Yet fifteen nrinutes devoted to Tarot shrdy every day can promote your growth more than honrs of other activities. The one parl of your day you cannot possibly afford to miss is your Tarot period. Your first practical exercise will be to commit to memory the eleven statements of the The Pattem On'Ihe Trestleboard. This was printed on the Tarot tableau you received with Introduction to Tarot. These eleven statements are the words of a sreat leader of the Inner School. They are based on an ancient esoteric text. Cornmit them to memory by first reacling the entire Pattern several times frorn beginning to end. Do not try to learn it a little at a time. See if you succeed in committing the rvhole. 'fhen fix it by writing out the Pattern. Use pen and ink or a fountain-pen, not a pencil. You might find this easier in the long run than any attempt to memorize the text bit by bit. LIse this rnetlrod of memorization in this first practice. (lf you find it too difficult to memortzethe whole, take it bit by bit.) Tlien you will have made a conect begiming in leaming hor.v to organize your mental activities. This, rementber, is a pattern, not a boastflll declaration of personal attainment. The trrrth it utters is about the SELF, the cosmic Life-power behind and above all personal rnanifestations. It is said to be \"on the trestleboard\" because in the old telminology of the building crafts a trestleboard is a sort of table on which are laid plans for the guidance of the workmen. Say the Pattern every morning on rising and every night before going to sleep. Be sure you do this whether you like it or not. Guard against automatic, parrot-like repetitions. Think the meaning of every sentence. Make this same effort every time you recite the words. it will aid yon to discover the deeper meanings . The next lesson will help you gain more insight into the truths behind these eleven sentences. The key is to be found in the numbering of the statements. Thus next week's lesson will really extend your study of the Pattern. As a preparation, get a notebook as soon as you tinish reading this lesson, if you have not already done so."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TAIIOT FUNDA A,IENTtILS: I Then think over what you have read and jot down any ideas r,vhich come into your mind. As you proceed with your daily stndy, continue to use the notebook. Make the entries short, but make them and date them. This notebook is important. It is your occult diary. Every scientific researcher keeps records. You must do the same. This book will be of great value in your later wolk. To slight it will be to defeat one main purpose of this instruction. Use it at every regular study period. Make an entry then even if you must LecoLd a failure to work at the time scheduled. You will need this diary in order to make reports from tirne to time, and you will find as time goes on that its contents have other uses. Keep it in a secure place and do not show it to anyone. With the third of these lessons you will begin cololing your Keys in accordance with instructions which are also given in the FIIGHLIGFITS OF TAROT booklet. When you color your own Keys they take on sornething of your own personality. They become inseparably linked with you. The work demands attention, and this will impress the details of every picture on your memory and build Tarot into your vety brain cells. Making the Tarot l(eys part of your flesh and blood must be your aim. It is what makes possible all the subtler and more potent utilizations of this alphabet of Ageless Wisdom. Remember, you are not aiming plirnarily at making your Keys works of art. Do thern as weil as you can. Whatever skill you may develop in using paints and brushes will prove to be of use to you when you unfold into a truly ploficient plactical occultist. Talot on the table, or in youl boohcase, is just a set of pictur..es printed on pasteboard. Tarot built into your brain is a living instrument thlough which you can make contact with sources of laroivledge and power greater than you realize now. Coloring your om Keys builds this insicle farot quiclcer and better than anything else. This week, spend your study periods as follows: 1. Memorize the Pattern. When you have it by hearl, always begin a study period by reciting it. 2. Read this lesson thlough, slowly, and, if possible, read it aloud. 3. Use the rest of the tirne to look over your 'farot Keys. You cannot be too farnilial with tliem. if any I(ey seems particularly attractive to you, make a note of it in your diary, along with the l'easou, if you have one. If you have an aversion fol any parlicular Key, note that also, and what you suppose to be the reason.
