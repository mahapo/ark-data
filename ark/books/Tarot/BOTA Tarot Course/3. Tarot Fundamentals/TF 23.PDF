[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT F'UNDAMENTALS Lesson Twentv-three RoTATIoN This version of I(ey 10 is a reproduction of the correct esoteric design. From it Eliphas Levi adapted the illustration in his Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum, which he drew to represent the Wheel of Ezelciel. Of this he wrote: \"The Wheel of Ezekiel is the type on which all the Pentacles of the Higher Magic are designed. \"When the adept is in the blessed possession of a full knowledge of the pov/ers of the Seal of Solomon and of the virtues of the Wheel of Ezekiel, which is indeed correspondent in its entire symbolism with that of Pythagoras, he has sufficient experience to design talismans and Pentacles for any magical pllrpose.\" \"The Wreel of Ezekiel contains tire solution of the quadrature of the circle, and dernonstrates the correspondence between words and figures, letters and emblems; it exhibits the tetragram of characteLs analogons to that of the elements and elemental forms. It is a glyph of perpetual motion. The triple ternary is shown; the central point is the first Unity; three circles are added, each with four attributions, ancl the dodekad is thus seen. The state of universal equilibrium is suggested by the counterpoised emblems and the pairs of opposites. The flying Eagle balances the Man; the roaring Lion counterpoises the laborious Bull.\" In the Cube of Space, the letter Kaph and I(ey 10 correspond to the dilection West. This is the face of the cube nearest the observer in diagrams like those in Lesson 18. Because nearest to tts, this western face of the cube represents those events and circumstances which, atany given moment, are in the immediate present. What sunonnds us now, however, is the culmination of a stream of events coming out of the past. Thus the present situation represents the end of a cycle of preceding activities, For this reason the present moment is syrnbolized by the direction West, the place of sunset corresponding to the end of a day. In occultism generally, as in the first chapter of Genesis, tlre word \"day\" stands for any tirne-period. us?300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7'AtlOT I''UNDAiUIEN IALS: 23 By its space attribution, I(ey 10 is in contrast to l(ey 3, the Empress. The latter is the Tarot syrnbol of the direction East, the place of sunrise or dawn. It represents the first stages of a cycle of manifestation. Key 10 represents the culmination of a stream of events having their origin in what is pictured by the Empress. Because there is a sense in r,vhich a whole series of events is continuous with its origin or cause, \\,ve lxay say that Key 10 is another aspect of the Empress. Thus we find that one of the names fbr Malkuth in Qabalah is I(allah, the Bride, while another is Malkah, the Queen. It is obvious that both these titles are applicable to the Empress. 'fhe connecting link between East and West, in the cube symbolism, is a horizontal line joining the center of the eastern face to the center of the western face. To this line is attributed Mem, the second of the three Mother letters associated with the element of water and with I{ey 12. \"W'ater\" is the root matter, and the root matter is what links the origins represented by East to the conseqlrences corresponding to West. Of this, more when we come to Key 12. In the symbols of i(ey 10, the bull, eagle, lion and man are supported by clouds to remind us that Jove and Jupiter are gods of rain and lightning and thunder. The four animals are the ones rnentioned in Ezekiel and in l{evelation. The lion corresponds to Yod (r) the first letter of illilt, Jehovah. The eagle is the second letter of that name, Heh (n). The man stands for the third letter, Vav ('l). The bull is the last lerter, linal Heh (i]). These living creatures are related also to the four fixed signs of the zodrac. The lion is Leo, the eagle Scorpio, the man Aquarius, and the bull Taurus. These are the fifth, eighth, eleventh and second signs. Their numbers in the zodracal series add to 26, which is the sum of the nurneral values of the letters in the name i'1'1hr, Jehovah. These lbur creatures are shown in the arms of Freemasoffy. On I(ey 10 they are placed in the corners of the design to illustrate the statement (quoted in Acts 17:28 from a hymn to Jupiter, written by the Greek poet, Cleanthes): \"ln him we live and move and have our being.\" The same thousht is in these lines from THE KAIVALYA UPANISHAD: \"Within me the universe came into being; Within me the universe is established; Within me the universe passes away; This Brahman. without a second. I myself am It.\" The number 10 is a combination of 0 and 1.

Let us consider the meaning of this. 0 is a symbol for the One Force. I stands for the POINT wherein that One Force concentrares itself. Concertring this, review the instruction in Lessons 3, 4 and 5. At the Central Point within itself, the One Force becomes active. This, consequently, is the Point where motion begins. What we are thinking of now is prior to all physical manit-estatiorr. It precedes the production of forms. It is the concentration of energy in fiee space. The free space, furthennore, is mental space. 'fhere is nothing but consciousness of itself at this Point where the One Spirit wakens ir-rto activity. Because there can be no other mode of activity at this awakening of consciotnness, the activity we are now considering must be, as Judge Troward has pointed out, activity which is wholly self-sustained. He goes on to say: \"The law of reciprocity, therefbre, demands a similar self-sustained motion in the material correspondence, and mathematical consideration shows that the only sort of motion which can sustain a self-supporting body in vacuo is a rotary motion, bringing the body itself into a spherical form.\" \"Now this is exactly rvhat we find at both extremes of the material world. At the big end the spheres of the planets rotating on their axes and revolving round the sun; and at the little end the spheres of the atoms consisting of particles which, modern science tells us, in like manner rotate around a common center at distances which are astronomical compared with their own size. Thus the trvo ultimate units of physical manifestation, the atom and the planet, both follow the sarre law of self-sustained rnotion which we have found that, on a priori grounds, they ought in order to express the primary activity of Spirit. And we may note in passing that this rotary, or absolute, motion is a combination of the only two possible modes of relative ntotion, that is to say, centrifugal and centripetal motion; so that in rotary or absolute motion we find that both polarities of tnotion are included, thus repeating on the purely mechanical side the primordial principle of the unity including the Duality in itself.\" This quotation frorn THE CREATIVE PROCESS IN THE INDIVIDTIAL, pages 29-30, deserves careful study. It is full of meat. Build up in your mind an irnage of the initial whirling motion in the vast expanse of the limitless Light. 'fhe doctrine of rotation is one of the most important in occultism, for it is concerned with the principles of groMh, involution and evolution, action and reaction, and the reciprocal relation between the members of every pair of opposites throughout the universe. This doctrine, yon should remember, has to do with things in manif'estation. Do not confuse absolute motion r t,t?300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAROT' ItUNDAI,tEN'fALS: 23 with the Absolute. Absolute motion is so called because it is self-derived and self-sustained, without being dependent on, nor conditioned by, other motes of activity. 'l he ilebrew letter i(aph (^3) printed on l(ey 10 represents a hand in the act of grasping, or a closed fist. Close your fist and turn it with the thumb toward you. See how the forefinger and tlrLrrlb .[onn a spilal. The activity of the One Force is not sirnply circular in form. It is spiral. Thus, and only thus, is growth possible, does evolution come about. The motion appears to return to its starting- point, but at each revolution it begins at a higher level. Review what was said about spiral activity in Lesson 19. The basic idea suggested by l(aph is comprehension or grasp. As stated above, we deal in this lesson with a law of finite manifestation. This law is within our mental grasp. It is a law operative throLrgh unirnaginable irnmensities. Yet it is finite and we can comprehend it. The principle of rotation at work tll'ough the entile series of cosmic manif-estations is an intelligible principle. We can understand and apply it. It has been syrnbolized fi\"orn time immemorial by a turning wheel. 'l'o I(aph, and thus to Key 10. the planet Jupiter is attributed. Astrology calls it the Greater Fortr-ine. Myth makes Jupiter ruler of the gods, and, tluough their agency, master of the clestinies of man. Linking the idea of comprehension implied by I(aph, the grasping hand, to these icleas associated with Jupiter, we have the thought that it is possible to comprehend the underlying laiv which governs human destiny. .Tupiter is the planet exalted in Cancer, the sign comected with i(ey 7. The wheels of the chariot represent the law of Rotation. Review l{ey 7 and you will see some of the practical applications of the Law of Rotation to your owr1 life. Try to comprehend the idea that even the least of your personal activities is a particular expression of some more extensive cycle of cosmic activity. Then you will begin to understand how it is that every detail of your personal life expression is adjusted to the sweep of currents of universal energy. Carried to cornpletion, such comprehension enables rnar) to free himself from every disease, every misfbrtune, every semblance of bondage. 'I'he power of .lupiter, the sky-father, is man's power. Yet this must be comprehended truly. The grasp of this principle is more than mere intellectual apprehension of'the meaning of the words which say that whatever we do is part of the cosmic ebb and flow. We must realize it.

As the shy-father (which is the literal meaning of his name), Jupiter is god of cloud, rain, thutcler and lightning. 'fhis is close to what science says concerning the nature of the physical world. Every physical lbrm is some special shape assumed by the electrical energy which pervades the atmosphere. The circulation of this energy produces whatever there is, A physical form may be thought of as being a condensation of the electro-magnetic \"rain\" which is the root-matter pervading all space and veiling the fiery energy of the One Force. This root-matter, with its interior fire, is the \"water\" of which occultists speak so often. 'fhe mode of consciousness associated with the letter Kaph is named \"The Rewarding Intelligence of fhose Who Seek\", or, \"The Intelligence of Desirous Quest\". What this means is that to complehend the Law of Rotation is to secure the satisfaction of every desire. This comprehension cones to real seekers, and to nobody else. Lazy minds cannot grasp truth. He who has no definite idea of what he wants never perceives the inner significance of the Law of Rotation. In some respects, this law is one of the most obvions in nature. We see it in operation cvr;i)'ffhele. Yei few pcistins urrdcrstand everi pi,ut ui'ivhai it irealis. One plain meaning is that what we send out comes back to us. The present state of the world is evidence that most persons do not see the truth of this. If humanity would realize that its future-not that of its children, but its very own future-depends entirely on its present actiolts, wars, strife ancl selfishness would come to an end. The idea of separate existence, of good to be obtained at the expense of others, would be lviped out. Do all you can to perfect )i0u1'owrr grasp of this law. Mal<e your exercise this week an endeavor to see the Law of Rotation at work. Begin by calling to mind every instance of cyclic or spiral activity you can identify. Then examine yourself. Look back over your past, and see how your experiences have run in cycles. Watch your moods, and you will find the same alternation of ebb and flow. Think of your present activities and try to picture what logical results yoll may expect from them in future exoerience. I r,s.,300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"'l' A l?
