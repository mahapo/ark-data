[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUI{DAMENTALS Lesson Twenfv-four THE WHtrEL OF FoRTUNE In Flebrew Wisdom, the number 10 is called Malkuth, the I(ingdom. A kingdorn expresses the will and authority of its ruler. The Tarot I(eys from 0 to 4 inclusive add up to 10, and a {'ew minutes inspection of these Keys will show you that flrey represent everything fundamental to the meaning of the noun \"kingdom\". A Greek name for 10 was Pantelia, signifying \"all complete\", or, \"fully accomplished\". Westcott says: \"Note that ten is used as a sign of fellowship, love, peace and union, in the Masonic third token, the union of two five points of fellowship.\" Ten is also the number of complete rnanifestation, according to the Qabalists. A correct comprehension or mental grasp (Kaph) of the ten aspects of the Life-power mentioned in the statements numbered 1 to 10 in 'fhe Pattern on the Trestleboard serves to place the mling po\\4/er in its right position in our thought. This ruling power is tlie Reality designated by the Hebrerv divine nane i'lliJr, Yahwe or Jehovah, identical in basic meaning with the Jove or Jupiter of the Romans. The title of Key 10 refers to Jupiter, called \"Lord of Fortune\" by astrologers. The perfection of good fbrtune is brought about by the right functioning of a center in the hurnan body known in occultism as the Jupiter center. Anatomists call it the solar plexus. l)o nclt be misled by theil name fbr it. It is not the Sun center. This group of nelve cells, sometimes called the epigastric plexus, is situated in the abdomen behind the stomach. Among the several ganglia it contains, the most important are the semilunar ganglia. 'fhis organ, sometimes known as the abdomir-ral brain, controls all the abdominal viscera and has oommand of assimilation. Its occult functions have to do with activities by means of which we nray synchronize our personal cycles with the universal cycles of the Lifb-power's self- expression. The solution of the quadrature of the circle, mentioned in oul quotation fiom Eliphas Levi at the beginning of the previous lesson is indicated by the total value of the eight letters on the rvlreel. Reckoned according to the Hebrew values, they add to 697 and the sum of the digits of this number is 22. If the Roman letters be reckoned according to their values in the Latin Cabala Simplex, the total of the I'lebrew and the Roman is 74 which reduces to the number 1 1. us0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":",I'A lIOT' F LIN D A A,TIiN']'AI,S. 2 4 Tlre relation of 22 and 1 I to the quadrature of the circle goes back to ancient times. 22 represents the relation of the circumf-erence of any circle to its diameter. This is only an approxintate \"squaring of the circle\", but it is close enough for all practical purposes. The ratio is that of a circumference of 22 to a diameter of J which is the same ratio as that of a circumference of I 1 to a diameter of 3-l 12. Both these numbers. 7 and 3-112. ocour as syrnbolic numbers in the Bible and in other occult writings. l-he l'act that this quadrature is only approximate has its own lesson for us. We never can take the exact measure of a manifestation of the Infinite because the Infinite itself is immeasurable. But wc can make approximations. This truth has been brought horne to modern science by the Quantum 'Iheory, Close averages, rather than absolute measures, are the tools of scientific lesearch. The relation between 22 as circomference and 7 as diameter is a key to many occult formulas of rnuch value. It occurs in the Bible, in the hieroglyphics and architecture of Egypt, in ancient magical medals, in cer tain passages of Oriental books on Yoga, and elsewhere. As you progress in your occult studies, it will conle up again and again. 'l'he tetragram (four-letter combination) of characters Levi mentions is shown in the middle circle of the wheel. At the top, under the letter T, is the character for alchemical Melcury. At f lre r'!g!rt, [.'eslcle the !eltel A. is the s.,mbol l-or elchernical Sulphur. at the left, beside the letter O, is the barred circle representing alchemical Salt. Above the ietter R, at the bottom of the circle, are the two wavy lines sometimes used by alchemists to symbolize Dissolution. IJec:ruse this symbol is used also for the sign Aquarius, and Aquarius corresponds to the Man among the living creatures, it may be understood to represent Man as the dissolver of the phanton'is of illusion. Mercury, Sr-rlphur ancl Salt, the three \"principles\" of the alchemists, correspond to the three gunas, or qualities, mcntioned by writers on Hindu philosophy. Do not be confused by \"prinoiples\" and \"qualities\", as used in the special senses here indicated. Mercnry corresponds to the Sattva-guna, or Wisdom, In these lessons we call it superconsciousness. Sulphur corresponds to the Rajas-guna, or passion and desire, inciting to action. This is the main characteri stic of sel f-conscious awareness. Salt corresponds to the Tarnas-guna, or the quality of inertia. This is the dominant characteristic of what we call subconsciousness. 'fhe symbol lbr dissolutiolr, which stands also fbr the sign of Man, Aquarius, reveals an important truth.

Here, in a sentence, is the theory of practical occultism, In the smallest circle is shown the alchemical symbol for Spirit, the Quintessence. This corresponds to the Akasha of the Hindus. The symbol is an eight-spoked wheel like that on the outer garment of the Fool. 'fhe centel of the Wheel, as Levi says, represents the First Unity whencs all motion originates. l'he central POINT is the Archetypal World of the Qabalists, symbolized also by the hnobs at the top of the staff and crown of tlie ilierophant. It is the world in which all the potencies of manif-estation, however extensive that manifestation may be, are concentrated into a single POINT. Surrounding this center, the smallest circle stands for the Creative World or mental plane. T'his is symbolized also by the upper bar of the Hierophant's staff and by the topmost of his tlrree crowns. In the next circle are the alchemical symbols of the forces active in the Formative World. T'his is represented by the rniddle bar of the l{ierophant's staff and by the second of his three orowns. The outer circle, containing letters which suggest the manifestation of the WORD, or the Logos, stands for the Material World, or World of Action. This is symbolized by the lowest bar of the Hierophant's staff and by the lowest of his three crowns. 1'he eight segments of the smallest circle divide the circumf'erence into arcs of 45 degrees. 45 is the value of the Ilebrew noun Dllt, Adam, the generic name fbr humanity, like the Latin homo, which also adds to 45 by Latin Cabala Simplex. What is suggested here is that the essential spiritual being, or Quintessence, is the same Life-power which is the spirit of humanity. The eight radiiof this circle remind us that 8 is the number of Hermes and of Christ. They ir-rclicate that the secret of mastering circumstance is to be sor-rght in the fact that the innermost spirit of humanity is identical with the ruling power (Christos, the Anointed) which sets into motion the wheeling activity of the cosmic cycles. The field rvherein man may apply the royal power of the Central Spirit is in the Formative World. IIe does this by combining the three alchemical principles in the Great Work which dissolves all seeming obstacles by the \"philosophical Mercury\". This is the right l<nowledge clf true comprehension suggested by the meaning of the letter-name Kaph, the grasping hand.

(This corresponds to our second law of thermo-dvnamics. lld.) -fhe letters in the outer circle spell hlitt, .Iehovah, in Hebrew, and Rota, wheel, in Latin. The le{\"ters of'Rota may be arranged to form a sentence, in Latin: Rota Taro Orat Tora Ator. It nteans: The Wheel of Tarot speaks the Law of Ator. Ator is one Latin spelling for the name of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, personifying Nature and Venus. Thus the law of Ator is the Lar,v of the Empress in Tarot. These letters are written in the outer circle to remind us that the Material World is really the piane of the uttered WORD of the indwelling Spirit. The serpent on the descending side of the wheel is yellow to represent light. Its wavy form symbolizes vibration. It stands for the descent of the serpent power, Fohat, into the field of physical tnanifestation. Thus it represents the involution of light into form. Hermanubis, the led figure rising on the right side of the wheel, stands for the evolution of Iblm, and is a specific symbol of the average present development of human personality. He has a human body with a jackal's head to show that humanity as a whole has not evolved beyond the intellectual level. His ears rise above the horizontal diameter of the wheel to indicate that thlough interior hearing man is beginning to have some knowledge of the segnrent of the cycle of evolution tluough which he is destined to rise. The segrnent of the r^rheel betu,een Ilermanubis enC the Sphirul oontains the letter Yod r,vhich is represented in Tarot b), the Hermit. What completes the unfoldment of man, and develops powers beyond his intellectual level of conscionsness, is an organic change. To eft-ect this is to accompiish the Great Work, and the letter Yod is a symbol of that accomplishrnent. F'or the perf'ection of the Work is the identificatiorr of the personal \"self', the Ego seated in tire heart, with thc Ancient of Days, the Silent Watcher of I(ey 9. T'he Sphinx symbolizes the perfeotion of this identification. She carries a sword, the weapon corresponding to the element of air, to the Formative World, and to the letter Zain, represented in Tarot by I(ey 6. Thus her weapon stands for conquest in the Formative World or plane wherein the subtle fbrces of the Life-Breath are at work. fhis conquest is effected by ri ght d iscri nrination. The Sphinx combines the two principal elements in tlie symbolism of I(ey 8. She has a woman's head and breasts combined with the body of a male lion. She is the union of male and female powers, the perfect blending of fbrces which, at lower levels of perception, appear to be opposed. A brief summary of the meaning oi'l(ey 10 is: All cycles of natural manif'estation are cycles in the orderly exlrression of One Power which is identical with the innermost Spirit of Man."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"7':1 R O 7' I; Li At 1).4 ltl li N'l A l, S : 2\"/ Tllcre is also a statement in TFIE KYBALION which has direct bearing on the meaning of I(ey 10.

YOU PARTAKE OF'COSMIC PERF'ECTION Look at i(ey 10 whenever your spirits are at a low ebb. Look at it when you f'eel a touch of irnpatience because you have not yet realized your heart's desire. But, most important of all, use this I(ey whenever you find yourself frittering away time, or doing relatively unimportant things when you ought to be busy with more urgent matters. To explain why the symbolisrn o['this l{ey raises emotional tone, why it curbs impatience, and why it stiffens your backbone rvhen you are trying to escape from important but distasteful tasks, would take pages of interpretation. What is important is that you take the prescription. One outstanding meaning of IGy 1 0 is that all manif'estation is cyclic. All rnani{'estation rotates. Spring, sulnmer, autumn, winter-something like these seasons rnay be observecl in all hr-rman activities. This ordered rhythrn is all pelvading. It does not change.

Plant too early, and growth may suffer from winter-kill. Every person has emotional ups and downs. The reclrrrence of these cycles varies with difl'erent people, but a little observation will enable you to determine when the wheel is tttrning upward fbt you, or when its motion is on the downward arc. When you have fbund this out, make a practice of beginning new enterprises on the upward emotional curve. Go witlr the wheel and make your seasons agree with the cosrnic ebb and flow. What you begin with plenty of drive and enthusiasm will keep on toward final realization, even during your \"clown\" days. Or-rly most of the activity will then be subconscious, and the best thing to do in these \"down\" pedods is to play a little more, sleep a little longer, and confine most of your activity (so far as circumstances permit) to rnore or less routine matters. I{ere you may find it profitable to make out a schedule of your daily activities and adhere strictly to it for a fortnight. Make appointments for every day. Protect your work-periods and your meditation-periods fiom intermption. You will not be able to carry this out 100%. Be sure to meet whatever interf'eres with your schedule in the mood of willing acceptance. Tliis appiies only to interf-erence liom outside. Do not yield to personal whims ancl f-eelings which tempt you to violate your schedule. Finally, try your utmost to develop your awareness that all your personal activities are actually special expressions of the cosmic cyclic activity picturecl by the Wheel of Fortune. Remind yourself again and again that the Whole is present in even the tiniest part. you will become increasingly aware of this if you look for the relation between your personal actions and the cosmic order. You will discover a fountain of riches within yourself which call never run dry. {"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TAROT' FUNDAMEN'fAI,S: 24 'fhe strifb, the quarrels, the contentions that thou witnessest day by day Are the play of the Liglit and Darkness which I am.
