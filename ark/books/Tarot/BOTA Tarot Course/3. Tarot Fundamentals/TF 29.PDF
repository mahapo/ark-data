[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Twentv-nine TRANSFORMATION So many superstitions are connected with the number 13 as a symbol of bad lucl< and disaster that you will not be surprised to hnd it assigned to the Tarot Key entitled Death. But, like so many things in occultism, we shall learn that 13 and Death have other meanings for those who know. Both the number and the title relate to the Law of Transformation which brings about dissolution and change. This change is often felt to be adverse because its outcome is unknown. Many persons fail to realize that without continual change lif'e could not exist, and that even if it coulcl, its monotony would be unbearable. 13 is the numbci of t-uvo IIebi'ew wuids, iiiN, Auiraci or Eoirud, meaning \"unity\", and illilN Ahebah or Ahevah, signifying o'love\". The Unity, the One Power fiom which all things proceed, is also the Love Power which is the cause of all attractions and affinities. We geuerally think of the Love Power as being concerned chiefly with reproduction. Thus to I(ey 13 is attributed the sign Scorpio, governing the reproductive organs. Scorpio is the natural ruler of the astrological \"house of death\", the eighth house. 'fhe same Love Power which leads to birth is what controls the physical changes resulting in dissolution and death. The Love Power govems both the beginning and the cessation of our bodily activities. This is important and you will do well to ponder it. There are not two antagonistic powers, one making for life, the other for death. There is only a single power which has a twofold rnanif'estation. Man fears death because he does not hnow the meaning of this transformation. \"Dissolution is the secret of the Great Work.\" The dissolution of form is imperative flor growth. When lbnns break down, energy is released to be utilized for further development. (The second law of thermo-dynamics of modern physics recognizes the fact that energy is released when previously established forms of matter break down.

Wlren he has achieved this mastery, lre is able to maintain his physical body fbr many years beyoncl the ordinary span of human life. Furthermore, in the full perfection of this rnastery, man is able to disintegrate his physioal body at will, and able also to reintegrate it. For such n man, death, as the rvorld knows death, is at an end. This is an amazing statement. 'Io the average person it sounds utterly preposterous. Possibly it is expecting too much to suppose you will accept this teaching at this stage of your progress. Whether you accept it or not, be sure yon know what the teaching is because when you have put yourself in a position to examine the evidence for the doctrine you will undoubtedly be fully persuaded that it is not an extravagant, fbnciful claim.

Your clear image of a changed organism which will be a perfect and beautiful body, botli in Itnction and appearance, has suggestive power which subconsciousness accepts. In response to that suggestion, subconsciousness is even now beginning to set in motion proccsses whicir lead to the desired transformations. You do not need to tell subconsciousness how to do these things. It already knows. Tell it what you want it to do and make your picture as clear and concrete as you can. Thus will man triumph eventually over physical death. Actually he has already triurnphed over death, because man does not die. lt is impractical here to present the tremendous accr-unulation of evidence now available in proof-of his survival of the death of the physical body. Sufllce it to say that this is an ascertainable fact. Any interested person may prove to his complete satisfaction that man does not die. Those who are prejudiced refuse to examine the evidence. They who are lazy will not take the trouble. Yet the evidence is abundant and thoroughly convincing. Modern scientific psychic research has fully proven survival of death. Man is immortal ancl can never die. 'Ihough his bodies change and disintegrate a thousand timcs, he remains.

As a verb, it signifies \"to sprout, to gl'ow, to propagate\". For centudes, the fish has been a symbol of Christ, the immortal principle present in every oue of us. It is only as we grow \"to the measure of the fulh1ess of the stature of Christ\" that we approach anything like true comprehension of life. fhe frrst moment of superconsoiousness, the true Self-realization, is mystically called the \"birth of the Christ-child\" in human personality. The iclea suggested by the noun \"fish\" is closely related to that of propagation, because fish are among the most prolific breeders. It is estimated that the progeny of a single pair of codfish, if thei, all arrived at rnaturity, would fill the Atlantic Ocean from shore to shore. This idea of plopagation is fully intimated by the attribution of the sign Scorpio to the letter Nun and to I(ey 13. Scclrpio, govertring the reproductive organs, indicates that the fbrce used in reproduction has to c1o with the liberating, transforming powers of dissolution. Do not be misled by this. What we have just said has nothing in common with the fantastic pseudo-occultism of certain free- iove cults. We speak of a force. Or:dinarily, this folce is utilized in the reproduction of the species. lt may be applied to higher pllrposes. It may be used to cl.range your consciousness so that you will hnow yourself to be immortal. It may be used also to modify the metabolism of your body so that you may renew it continually, or, if you so dosire, dissolve it instantly and as qllickly reconstitute it.

Our most plecious heritage is this power which ordinarily manifests itself in bodily death. T'he very power which, because we misunderstand it and misapply it, results in disease and cleath, is the power whereby we may experience perpetual health and immortality. T'his is the power of lif'e ancl growth to all who obey its law. Only to those who disobey it is it the instrument of death and destruction. In this conncction, temember that tlre serpent, the scorpion and the eagle are all nsed to symbolize Scorpio. Remember, also, that our modern science is beginning to make use of the benelicent action of serpent venom, modified by human intelligence, for the relief of disease. So does external science catch up, over and over again, with the intuition of the wise who inventcci the esoteric svmbols.
