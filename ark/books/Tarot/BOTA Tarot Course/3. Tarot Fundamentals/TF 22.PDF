In Key 8 we see a fertile valley warmed by tl-re sun. Here is an icy, wind-swept peak, wrapped in darkness. This cloes not mean that they who reach the heights of adeptship receive naught for their pains but a sterile, icy, perception of abstract truth. The Hermit's gray robe, symbol of wisdom, keeps him warm. Hc carries his own light. The cold and darkness merely symbolize the Iatency of the fiery activity of the One Force, and are in contrast to the lion of Key 8. The licights of spiritual consciousness seem cold and dark to those who have not scalecl them; br.rt they who stand upon these lofty peaks endure no dlscomfort. The ice at the Flermit's f-eet is the source of the river in the Empress'garden, the same river which flows behind the Emperor and the Chariot. This ice, therefore, is the substance of the Iligh Priestess' robe in another fbrm. That robe, as you read in Lesson 8, symbolizes the root iiiattci'r,\"hicli ur'dct'lies all -uaiiatiuns of furtii.

A bearded ancient is the central ligure of this picture. He is the \"Most Holy Ancient One\", iclentit-red in Qabalah with the Primai Will. FIe is clad in gray, a mixture of black and rvhite, the colors of the High Priestess'pillars, of the wand and rose of the Fool, and of the sphinxes which draw the Chariot. His garment therefore represents the union and equilibration of all pairs of opposites. IJis cap is shaped like a letter Yod. It is blue, the color of the High Priestess' robe, to intimate that the one Identity always perfectly recollects its own nature and powers. The cap, tnoreover, is a sort of crorvn. This bit of symbolism says to an initiated observer: The Clown is Yod. No comment is required. T'hey who are retrdy to receive the instruction compressed into these fclur words will perceive the tremendous import of the statement. Yet it would be impossible to give more light to the unprepared even though we devoted many llages to attempts at explanation. 'fhe Herrnit has brought his lantern and staff fi'om the valley below whence he came. The staif, a branch of a tree, is a prodr,rct of the organic side of nature. It refers to the fiery activitv ( r,sO 3 00"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7'A ItOT };IINDAA,IENT\"l L,S. 22 of the serpent power of I(ey 8. The Flermit useci this power to help hint climb the mountain, ancJ in some versions of Tarot the staff is drawn to look like a serpent. In other versions, but not the older ones, a coilecl snake with uplifted head is on the ground in fi'ont of the Hermit. 'fhis is alt unnecessary innovation. 'fhe staff itself is sufficient indication of the serpent power. The l{ermit holds the staff in his left hancl to show tltat lre no longer needs it for clirnbing. '['he staff grew, but the lantern was made. It is of glass and metal derived from the inorganic sicle o1'nature. The basic principles on which our understanding of cosmic law is founded are discorzerable in the physical, chemicai and electrical activities of the mineral kingdorn. Our chicf-source of illumination (the lanlern) is man's mental grasp of the meaning of these basic activities. Yet we rely on the Lif'e-power's expression through organic beings (the staff) to assist us in our endeavors to rise above the limitations of self-consciousness to the heishts of sLlperconscious realization. The light in the lanteru is fiorn a six-pointed star'. The star is composed of two interlaced equilateral triangles. From time immemorial it has typified the union of opposites. One great Master o1'the Wisdom has written that he rvho nnderstands this syrnbol of the hexagram in all its aspects is virtually an adept.

To Yod also is assigned the ciirection North-Below, corresponding to the line of the Cube of Space in which North (Peh, I(ey 16) and Below (Gimel, Key 2) are united. What is symbolized by I(ey 9 is sorlething at worli in man at the subconscious level. This is true in spite of all the symbolisrn suggesting height. Our contact with the One Identify is an interior contact made in the darhness of subconsciousness. Subconsciousness is our instrument for oommunion rvith superconsciousness. Thus the Tarot tablcau in Lesson 2 shows the number 9 between 2 and 16 as the agellcy lvhich carries the powcr of 2 into the {reld of expression represented by 16. The power expressed by the Hermit is dletwn llom sources typified by the I{igh Priestess, and it is applied to the activity symbolized by I{ey 16.

In I(ey 8, the emphasis was on personal effort, on conscious control of the animal and other subhuman forces. The stress in Key 9 falls on the cloctrine that personal action is really a response to superconscious influence. 'fhe most inrportant tratxfonnations are those of which we are quite unconscious. Tliey oocur below the thresliold of conscious awareness in the region of our physical bodies which, say astrologers, is govcrned by the sign Virgo. Yct these transformations are direct consequences of the conscious effort picturecl by Key 8. .lust as the record on the scroll of the I{igh Pliestess is derived from what the Magician observes, so is the contact which is established interiorly, whereby we become awale ol the One ldentify, a consequerlce of the worl<ing of the power oIthe Magician through the agency of the woman in I(ey 8. This woman is just the instrumentality through which the Magician works. It is his power that tames the lion, not hers. Therefbre Key 9 represents not only the rulership, but also the exaltation, of the planet Mercury. This astrological doctrine, as applied in practical occultism, means that our power to take conscious cotnmand of certain processes which go on in the Virgo region of the human bocly enables us to set a pattern for subconsciousness, a pattern whereby the human body is lransformed into a finer, regenerated vehicle fbr the One Self. The actual building process is made possible by changes in the blood stream. These chanses are initiatecl in the Virgo region of the human body. 'l'ltey are never begun until one understands, intellectually, the law which makes them possible. One must know that subconsciousness is amenable to suggestion. One must know that subconsciousness controls body functions and body structure. One must larow that patterns impressed on subconsciousness from the self-conscious level will begin alterations in blood chetnistry, in organic functions, and even in the structure of certain parts of the body. One urust knor,v that the human body is built from materials taken into the blood strearn from chyle in the small intestine. All this knowledge is really a participation in the Constituting inteliigence symbolized by the Ernperor. It is head knowleclge brouglrt into our personal field of consciousness by the functions of the brain, ruled by Aries. It is a sharing of the vision of reality which is always present to the all- seeing eye of Universal Mind. Thus it corresponds to the Ernperor, and to the direction North-East. 'fhroLrgh bodily changes occuruing in the Virgo region, this head lcnowledge is actually incorporated into the physical organisrn. It is then brought to bear on that part of the body whioh, as being under tire astrological dominion of Libra, corresponds to the line North-West on the Cube of Space, and to I(ey 1 1 in 'Iarot."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T/1 ROT'FtlNDlA,f EN'l'AI\",r: 22 l,ibra governs the kidneys and the adrenal glands. In the Libra area of the body are organs which perform some of the most important physical functions. This lesson is not the place to cliscuss these functions which will come in for more extended examination in the course entitled The Great Work. Yet here it may be said that organs in the Libra area control the state o1'chemical equilibrium in the blood stream. Upon this equilibrium, not only ordinary health, but also the speciarl organic conditions peculiar to adeptship, absolutely depends, T'he line North-Below connects also the northern end of the line East-Below, assigned to the letter Cheth, and to l(ey 7, to the northern end of the line West-Below, assigned to the letter Ayin ancl to I(ey 15. This relation, like that between Zainand Samekh, mentioned in Lesson 20, must wait explanation until we study i(ey I5. In the meantime, you should take careful note of'all the symbols on the lefl-hand, or northern, side of Key 7. In these you will find inclicatior-rs as to the sources ol'power expressed through I(ey 9 and brought to bear through the agency o{'what is pictr\"rrecl by Key 15. The picture of the Herrnit tells Lrs that above the merely personal level of our daily experience is a r:eal Presence, which is all that we aspire to be. Tliat Presence, however far off it may seefit, horvever inadequately rve rnay lrnderstand it, however shrouded in darliness and obscurity its real nature, is always fiiendly and helpful.

Actii'cly present in all we think, or sily, or do is this One Identity, the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the fundamental and sole Will. whence all manifestation proceeds. I(ey 9 has direct connection r.r'ith each of tiie I(eys preceding it. As the number 9, it is the end of a uumerical cycle and includes within itself each of the preceding numbers in the series of digits. For instancc, the Ilermit is connected in many ways with the Fool. I-Ie is the Fool afler the lattcr's itsccnt from the valiey of rnanil'estation. The Fool is Spirit in its aspect of Eternal Youth. 'Ihe l:Iermit is the same Spirit in its aspect of all-embracing experience. Both are really one, fbr youth and age are but appearances of the No-Thing which is at once the oldest and the youngest reality in the universe. This week, try to establish a logical connection between Key 9 and the other Keys, from 0 to 8 inclusive. You will find this exercisc of great benefit in your Tarrot work since it is essential that yel iearn to recognize the relationships existing among the l{eys. Skill in this comes by practice.

',Extension',, iu the title of this supplementary text, is related to space, ers when we say that extension is that property of a body r'vhcreby it occupies a portion of space. Our title has ancient occult associations' It is the English of a Greek phrase used in 1he Eleusinial Mysteries. In l(cy 9, tlte idea of the extension of light is represented by the star in the Fle''it,s lernter.n. 'fhe I'lcfmit is the Self, the one, indivisible lleing of whom persons are centers of expression. That Self is the only Will-sourcc in the utriverse. Allpersonal volitiops are really only our responscs to that One Will. 'l'lte basis o1'all personal activity is our participation in that One Light zrnd in the power of that Onc Will. 'l'he syrnbolism of Key 9 is associated with tlre funclamental letter of the l{ebrew alphabet, Yocl' which is a compottent part of'every letter in the Flame Alphabet. I1 eabalisrn, the trumber 9 is named \"I;ottudaticln\", so tl\"ratthe number of this Key stands fbr all that is basic i' our lives. Put simply, the lessou of l(ey 9 is that our personal lives, in even the least pafticulars, are rcsponses to the llorv of ellergy originating in the One Self. Whether we know it or not, that Sell'is what is designated by the prorlourl\"l,\" and the letter Yocl (equivalent to \"1\") is also the initial letter of the worcl i''l'lili.lehovah. inclicatine God. ancl o1'rlre nor-rn nlrnr yekhiclah, the term Qabaiists ernploy to clesignate the One Self. Becattse the hand (Yod) is the creative instrurnent of the greater part of human ac6ievements, the entphasis in this pair of lessons is on the sense of touch. 'Iouch is basic in trll use ol.tools. Ilc wllo sttl'fers from a sensory paralysis which clestroys his sense of touch ca' neithcr Jrold trot'guicle tools. Touch is the founclation for all activities calling for rnanual sftill.

Moreover, to realize our heart's desire, solicl and talgible thi'gs must be brotrght into being. No matter how abstract our ideal may seem to be, there is always sor.uething that can be touched included in the actual realization. 'l'hus the exercise tbr this pair of lessons is fourfold. First, while you zu.e worhing with Key 9, cxpcriurent with touch. Give special attcntion to your hands. Notice more viviclly the sligSt dil'f'crences irt the lcel, say, of apen and apencil.
