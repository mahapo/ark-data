'fhe Law of Equilibriurn is brought to bear through the directive activity of self-consciousness and by means of the serpent power (Keys 1 and 8.) The two curtains suggest duality and polarity and their symmetrical anangement typifies balance. Their folds are reminiscent of the drapery of the High Priestess and suggest vibration. Their color, violet, is complementary to the yellow background. It is also the color associated with the letter I(aph and with Key 10. This means that the mechanical aspect of tttriversal manifestation, symbolizedby the Wheel of Fortune, veils the living, conscious Identity behind. l'he throne repeats the symbolism of the pillars of the High Priestess and the veil between thern.

The orown is surmounted by a triple ornarnent. This refers to the letter Shin, printed on I(ey 20, which is in close correspondence with l(eys 2 and 1 1. This triple ornament rcpresents the serpent power which, in its most exalted manifestation, releases human consciousness from the limitations of three dimensional interpretations of the experiences wliich man receives through his physical senses. The circle and square on the liont of the crown refer to the movement of Spirit within the field of physical form. This little detail of the symbolism is connected also with I(ey 10 which shows a wheel or circle rnoving in space bounded by the four mystical anirnals. 'l-he ornament on the breast of Justice combines a T-cross with an ellipse. The cross is indigo, the color associated with Saturn. This detail foreshadows the mathematical elements combined in the composition of I(ey 21 . It is a reference to the exaltation of the planet Saturn in the sign Libra. The pointed blade of the sword has the same basic meaning as the ox goad. The blade is of steel, the metal ruled by Mars, in reference to the fact that whenever the Venus force dominant in Libra comes into play, the Mars force is active also. Venus and Mars are complements. The activity of the one always excites the activity of the other. us0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"t'A \\to7' TIlN Dt A,,t ENT,l LS. 2(t The hilt of the sword is a'f-cross. Thus the uplifted hilt of the sword is another indication of the exaltation of Saturn in Libra. The sword-hilt is golden, relating it to the Sun whose metal is gold. IIere is a hint of a profound alchemical secret having to do with the transmutation of \"[ead\" into \"gold.\" Rut there is a simpler meaning also. Saturn represents limitation and fonn. l'he Sun stands for light and radiation. When the power of limitation is used positively, it is combined with the radiant energy of the Sun. Thus enlightenment exalts form. ln tlrc I'iebrew alphabet, Zain is the letter wlrich corresponds to the sword, A sword cuts ofl-. Thus it symbolizes the eliminative process, physical and mental. This is, of course, a oorrespondence to Libra, which governs the kidneys, the organs which maintain the chemical equilibrium of the blood by eliminating waste. The practical psychological meaning of the sword is: \"tJse right discrimination to rid yourself of everything useless, to free yourself from attachnrenl, from prejudice, from resentment and regret.\" 'Ihe scales represent weighing and measuring, or the exercise of mental powers related to mathematics. The pans of the scales are semicircular. Hence each semicircle stands lbr I 1, since 22 is the number representing a complete circle. 'fhus the pans of the balance represent the equilibration of the 11 pairs of complementary activities coresponding to tbe 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the 22 Tarot Keys.

The length of the cross-bar of the scales is the same as that of each of the lines supporting the pans. Thus seven equal straight lines are shown. They refer to the seven aspects of the Lif-e- power represented by Keys 1,2,3, I 0, 16, l9 and 21-the Keys corresponding to Mercury, Moon, Venus, .Iupiter, Mars, Sun and Saturn. These seven heavenly bodies correspond also to the seven alchemical metals, and to seven centers in the human body which bear the same planetary names. Again, the seven l(eys just mentioned correspond through their respective Hebrew letters to the six sides and the interior center of the Cube o1'Space. The seven equal lines of the balance rel'er also to the relationship of-I(ey 1 1 to the sign Libra wlrich is the seventh sign of the zodiacal series. This is the same sort of hint that is given in I(ey 9 where the six-pointed star in the Hermit's lantern is a reminder that Virgo is the sixth sign. The seven equal lines remind us of the seven-sided figure, the regular heptagon, which appears so often in alchemical diagrams. This heptagon is the geometrical basis for the construction of the seven-sided vault described in the Rosicrucian manifesto.

The number of the square is 4, and two triangles are twice 3, or 6. I{ence, by their an'angement, the seven equal lines give a hint of the number 10, as well as a direct presentation of 7. In occult arithmetic, 10 and 7 are related. The sum of the numbers from 0 to 7 is 28 and the digits of 28 add to 10. What is weighed and measured by the scales of Justice is the complete manifestation of the personal activities symbolized by i(ey 7. The activities, though secmingly originating in the field of personality, are really cosmic operations also. Hence the chariot moves because it is on wheels and the wheels represent what is more explicitly symbolized by l(ey 10. The Law of i(arma is the consequence of the rotation of the cosmic cycles. The direction assigned to Lamed and to l(ey I I is North-West. Tliis is the line of the Cube of Space at the junction of the western face, assigned to l(aph and I(ey 10, with the northern face, assigned to the letter Peh and l(ey 16. The latter I(ey relates to Mars, and Key 10 is a symbol for.lupiter. Now look at I(ey 1 1, On its lefthand or northern side, yoll see the uplifted sword of Mars. In thc other hand of Justice is the pair of balances whose two semicircular pans, fitted together, would make a sphere or wheel. Thus the outstanding elements of the symbolism of l(ey 1 I are directly connected with the two directions, North and West, joined in the line assigned to Lamed. The line North-West connects the western end of the line North-Above (assigned to Key 8 and T'eth) to the western er-rd of the line North-Below (Assigned to Key 9 and Yod). Because the general meaning of West, as explained in Lesson 24,is the completion of a cycle of activity, it follows that i(ey 11, joining the western ends of the lines corresponding to l(eys 8 and 9, represents the culmination of the activity symbolized by these two I(eys. Key 8 has to do with conscious, and l(ey 9 with subconscious, activities which reach completion in what is represented by Key 1 l. The modif-rcation of Karma by right discrirnination and right judgment, applied to work or action, is the outcome of processes typified by i(eys 8 and 9. i(ey 1 1, as related to the line North-West, is likewise what joins the northern end of the lines West-Above (assigned to Samehh and Key 14) and West-Below (assigned to Ayin and l{cy l5;, but the explanation of this must be de{'erred until we come to the interpretation of these two Keys. fhe cape of Justice is green, the color attributed to Venus.

This force has to do with the function of the adrenal glands, governed by Libra, because the adrenals control the tonicity of the entire muscular system. Thc genelal symbolic meaning of the robe thus relates to what enables us to work. The dais and throne are of stone, meaning that the Law of Equilibrium is operative even in the mineral kingdom. For many persons, the physicai plane is the only one concerning which they have any direct sense-experience. Tarot means us to understand that if we interplet correctly our experience of the physical plane we shall learn all that is necessary to know in ordel to begin using the Law of Equilibrium. \"'l'lrat which is above is as that which is below.\" One need not be able to sense higher planes in order to see the law at worl<.

THE SECRBT OF WORK Loose ernployment of the word Karma among students of occultism who are more or less inlluenced by Oriental philosophy, necessitates some additional explanation. In the minds of many, l(arma lneans: \"ln this lif-e i am in some measure determined by what I did in my {brmer lives. Good luck' is I(arma working itself out. [Jnusual aptitudes are Karma. Bad luck' is l(arma also.\" Because Occidentals have a different racial and philosophic background, what they under stand by the Eastern doctrine is often confused. Thus it needs to be said that Karma is not Fate, nor is it what the Greeks personified as Nemesis. Neither is it the I(ismet of the Mohzrmmedans. Primarily, I(arma means simply \"action\", but it has also the additional comotation of \"work\", which is the special attribution of the letter Lamed in the Qabalah. Lt,\\0304"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TA]1OT F{/ NDAA4ENT'ALS.. 26 Many sllppose that the Law of I(arma is exactly expressed by the scientific truth, \"action and reaction are equal\". Others, rightly, say the Biblical text, \"Whatsoever a man sowetl1, that shall he also reap\", sllms up the Law of Karma. Yet the analogy suggested by \"action and reaction are equal\" is false if the working of Karma be supposed to be exactly the same as that of action and reaction in physics. Throw a ball against a wall and the distance of its rebound will be slightly less than that of the original throw, the difference being accounted for by the energy absorbed by the wall and by the ball at the point of impact between them. But if he who throws the ball runs fbrward toward the wall, and is able to catch the ball hal[way between the wall and the place where the ball was thrown. a new element enters. That is, though action and reaction are always equal, the oonsequences of past action may be considerably modified by subsequent action. Aga.in, though what is sown tnust be reaped, the Bible does not say, \"What you sow you must eat.\" If tares be tnixed with the wheat, they rnay be separated when the crop is harvestecl and gathered into bundles to serve as fuel for the ovens where bread made from the grain is baked. 'fhus the Western School differs fiom exoteric Flinduism, which suffers from characteristic Oriental pessimism, and leads to the conclusion that it is futile to do anything about i(arma. (llsoteric Oriental philosophy, of course, understands that I(arrnamay be modified.) We do not escape the results of past action, but we may change the results by what we do now. This is the outstanding lesson of Key I l. We weigh the meaning of present conditions. We strike a balance by exerting ourselves positively to overcome the negative consequences of past crrors. We use the sword of discrirnination to eliminate mistaken thought and action, and to separate the wheat fi'om the tares. We overcome evil with good, and we begin in our minds by seeing to it every day that we sow and cultivate a crop of positive thini<ing, and carry out oul thinking with corresponding action. Marly Occidental students of Oriental Philosophy have interpreted the teachings on Karma to Inean that each individual is a law unto himself and tliat he will reap exactly as he has sown in this or fbrmer lives. I{owever, there is another aspect which requires deep consideration. Ageless Wisdom teaches that each individual is a particularized unit in the One Self. When the liver is ill, tite entire body is affected. When the liver is healthy the entire body benefits, In iike manner, every individual afTbcts, and is affected by Humanity in general. As a social unit, we reap the benefrts of science, techr-rology, electronics, etc., enjoying a host of the \"good\" things in life, contributed by a fbw individuals. this can be thought of as our participation in the group karma on the positive side. But likewise, the unevolved expressions of individuals will also af1bct the Whole. There is no injustice or pain which we do not partal<e of in some measure. We share the One Life together, in all its aspects. Let us then, wolk unceasir:rgly to transmute our thinking, feeling, and doing.
