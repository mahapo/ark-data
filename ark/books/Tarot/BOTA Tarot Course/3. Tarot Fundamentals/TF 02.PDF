[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMBNTALS Lesson Two THE SYMBoI-Tsm On NUMBERS Number symbols represent truths immanent in all things and manif'est in all phenomena. 'Ihe science of number is the for\"urdation of every other department of human knowledge. Resolve to master thoroughly its elements presented in this lesson. Thus will you prepare your mind to understand principles and laws which you will apply to bring yourself into harmony with the rhythms of the cosmic life. The same principles to which the science of number is a key will make you ruler of your personality and free you from restricting limitations in your environment. Let no fancied inaptitude or dislike fbr mathematics deter you from entering seriously into this study. You need not be quick at figures. You require no natural bent for abstruse abstractions, Set to work, and you can master the main points in a short time. The practice will make you proficient in the various applications of these principles. The numerai symbois, from 0 to 9, represent successive stages in errery cycie of the Life- poler's self-expression, whether on the grand scale of the cosmos, or on the smaller scale of personal unfoldment. The order in the numeral series reflects an order which prevails throughout creation. It is therefore an ancient doctrine that the Master Builder has ordered all things by number, measure and weight. Everywhere the properties of number are manifest, whether in the whirling of electrons within an atom, or in the arrangement of parts in a living body. Thus a 1-amous relativist is reported to have said: \"Number is one of the few things in the universe which is not relative.\" This lesson will attempt nothing like an exhaustive treatment of number symbolism. For the present, an outline of the basic meanings of the numeral signs will suffice. As you proceed with your studies you will gather a great deal more information about numbers and their sigrrificance. Some of the attributions may not seem clear the first time you read them. A fbw may even strike you as being {ar-l'etched or arbitrary. Do not let this disturb you. Keep your purpose in view. You are learning number symbols because they are the basis of the occult language used by initiates to transmit their knowledge fiom generation to generation. .t,t0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TA RO T F' U N D A ]14 E N 7' A L 5., Even if the symbols were purely arbitrary (which they are not), you must know their traditional interpretations in order to understand the esoteric language of the mysteries. No satisfactory substitute fbr this language has been devised. By means of it, two initiates may carry on a long conversation even though neithel knows a word of the other's native tongue. By means of a few lines and figures, an adept can express more meaning than he could pack into pages of words. When you have memorized the basic ideas of this numeral system, you will begin to see the connections between them and others related to them. ln this lesson, the key-ideas are underlined at the beginning of every paragraph of attributions. The other meanings fbllow. An irnportant part of yonr mental training is to trace the links of association which ioin the key-words to the others in the same paragraph. i3e sure you do this. In Lesson I you learned that there is a connection between the numbers and the corresponding sentences of The Pattern on the Trestleboard. The key-words in the Patteln are capitalized, and there is a sense in which every key-word may be taken as the name of the corresponding number.

The meaning of a number consisting of two or more digits may be ascertained by combining the ideas indicated by each symbol, beginning always witli the digit on the right-hand or units place. 'I'hus the number 10 combines the ideas of 0 and 1, with l considered as being the agency expressing the power represented by 0. Furthermore, since 10 follows 9, it implies that 9 stands for a finality which refers to a single cycle of evolution only. The completion of a cycle is always a return to the Eternal No-Thing, 0; but since 0 is essentially changeless in its inherent nature, the Eternal Source is eternally a self-manifesting power. Consequently, a new cycle begins as soon as the preceding cycle ends. Thus the number 10 symbolizes the eternal creativeness of the Life-power; the incessant whirling forth of the Self-expression of the Primal Will; the ever-turning wheel of manifestation.

Set aside ten pages in your occult diary. Flead each page with one of the numeral signs and its key-word. Then copy each paragraph on the meaning of the numeral symbols. This is important. To copy anything is to make it more surely yours than if you merely read it. As the days pass, whenever you get an idea about the meaning of some number, make a note of it on the proper page o1'your book. If you come upon anytliing in your reading, copy it under its appropriate heading. Do not consult other texts on numbers, or look up articles on the meanings of numbers, in order to fill the pages of your book. Make notes of ideas which coilre to you from your own inner consciousness, but copy only what seems important whenever you encounter it in the course of your ordinary reading and study. Just at present, do not go in quest of numerical information. What you need will come to you. It will come without special effort. You will be astonished at the quantity of material bearing upon the significance of numbers which will seem to flow in your direction, as if by magic. By magic it will be, because your work sets going the hidden fbrces of subconsciousness as explained in Seven Steps. In time, this section on numbers will become one of the most valuabie items in your oersonallv constructed reference library of occult science. Another good practice is to look r.rp the exact dictionary definitions of the numbers from 0 to 9, and of evely word in the ten paragraphs of explanations given in this lesson. This will make you realize that the occult science of number is part of the fundamental structure of lruman thought. You will gaina great deal of insight fiorn this exercise. During your study period, affange your Tarot Keys thus: I 8 15 2 9 16 J 10 L7 0 4 11 l8 :t t2 l9 6 13 21) 7 t4 2l lncluding the placing of the Fool, this is the same arrangement as on the tableau you received with Introduction to Tarot. Examine it carefully, paying particular attention to the numbers of the l(eys. Try to connect them with the pictures. in the Keys from 10 to 21, try to work out the meanings of the numbers from what you have learned concerning the ten symbols. t_i,\\'0 300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T' A R ()7' t' (t At D A I,I E N T' ti l. S Transclibe your findings and your coniectures into your notebook. Do this, no matter how trivial or vague your first attempts may seem. You must make a beginning. These first endeavors to formulate ideas for yourself are like seeds which will bear a harvest of good fruit later. In the foregoing affangement of the Tarot Keys, the zero card is placed above the others to indicate that No-number, to which it corresponds, is logically superior to, and precedes, the idea of beginning represented by 1. 0 is also separated fiom the other number symbols because it is not really in the sequence of manifested appearances. Number, however far the series may be extended, oomes always to a final member or term of that particular series beyond which there is the No-Thing. Between any two numbers in a series, moreover) nothing intervenes, Thr\"rs the zero Key of Tarot represents: l. What precedes the series; 2. What follows itl 3. What may be thought of as occupying the place of mediator between any two consecutive nnmbers of the series. To indicate this last idea, Eliphas Levi, when he published his intentionally incorrect attribution of tire Tarot Keys ro the ietters of the Hebrew aiphabet, placeci the zero Key between those numbered 20 and2I. For your information, though you may not be able to use it now, the seven Keys in the top row refer to powers or potentialities of consciousness. Those in the middle row are symbols of laws or agencies. The Keys in the bottom row represent conditions or effects. Thus I(ey I is the power which works through the agency of Key B to modify the conditions or effects symbolized by Key 15. In this tableau, again, ten pairs of Keys balance numerically through 1 1, the Key named Justice, a symbol of equilibrium. Notice that this Key occupies the central position in the tableau. The number 11 is one-half the sum of any two numbers which are placed diametrically opposite in the tableau. Any such pair of Keys always bears numbers whose sum is 22, such as 1 and 21,9 and 13, 6 and 16, and so on. Key 1 1 is both the arithmetical and the geometrical center, or mean, between the two Keys in each of these ten pairs. Next week you will begin to color your Keys. There are many fine types of coloring rnaterials available in stores these days. The Prang box of watercolors, made by The American Crayon Cclmpany, is a satisfactory and inexpensive set consisting of sixteen colors. These include the twelve semitones fi'om Red to Red-Violet, and four extra pans: White, Black, Brown and Turquoise Blue. In addition to these, you may provide yourself with a pan each of silver and gold. Prang also off-ers sets of colored pencils for those who prefer them. You can purchase r ts0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TAROT' IIUN DAMENT'AI,S: 2 your water colors or other coloring medium at any stationery store or art shop or you may purchase the Prang watercolors or pencils directly from B. O. T. A. Color only one card at a time, and wait fbr the instructions in the lessons. Begin by reading the directions straight through. Before applying color to any Key try to visualize exactly how it will look when it is finished. Tliis is a practical exercise of great value. It tends to clarify and make definite your mental imagery. It also intensifies the suggestive power of the Keys. Be sure to do it before coloring any I(ey. For the best watercolor results, you will need two watercolor brushes, a No. 3 and a No. l We recommend Devoe & Reynoids red sable, since they are satisfactory and comparatively inexpensive. A porcelain dish with at least six chambers will also be of help, though not absolutely necessary. Flesh color should be a combination of red, yellow, brown, black and white. This is to be representative of all five races. Each person should proportion the mixture of these five colors according to his or her own desires. Apply the colors in the order given for each Key. Long experience has enabled us to detennine this order, because of the qualities of the various kinds of watercolor. For instance, the reason we recommend you to wait until last to apply the red is that it runs very easily. Consequently\" if applied too soon, it mai'run into a color you are applying next to it, and so spoil your work. To give a lif-elike appearance to the cheeks of the human figures, use a diluted red solution. A dih-rted brown with a trace of orange over the eyes enhances the appearance, but we recommend that you do not try tl-ris unless you are sure you can do it skillfully. Blond hair is yellow with a little brown added. You can tell how much brown to add by testing on white paper. l-he l(eys can be made more striking if you use white, but this is an opaque color and difficult to use without covering up the black lines. Gold and silver may be used where indicated in the coloring directions This is not by any fireans neoessary, and gold and silver are difficult to apply. Wherever gold is called for, you may use yellow, or yellow with a trace of orange added to make golden yellow. For silver, use white, or leave blank. If your colors do not appear bright enough, it is because yoll have applied them too diluted. This can be remedied by going over them again until the desired shade is secured. When this is necessary, be sure the first coat is thoroughly dry beforc you apply another.

If you try your colors before applying them, you will have little difficulty. By lbllowing these directions carefully you should be well pleased with the results. Let us suggest again that you read the directions for each card carefully before applying any color. In this way you will avoid coloring portions which should be left blank fbr another color. llxperience has taught us that this precaution is very necessary. You will frnd that coloring your Tarot Keys will make them come to life for you. You will start to develop a response to the pictorial images from a f'eeling level, and this in turn will give you an extraordinarily increased ability to transmute old subconscious habit patterns into positive states of being and doing. Coloring your Tarot Keys will increase your ability to live vividly in the here and now. You will become aware of subtleties of color, miracles of form, and the increased awareness of the sense of touch will do much to develop your inner contact with the Higher Self. All these intensified aspects of consciousness must have their effect on environment! No amount of affirmations as taught in elementary n:retaphysics will be effective if the inner responses to every day life experience remain unchanged. Colol your Tarot Keys and work with them as instructed. The impact it will have on your subconsciousness will become discernible to you in ever greater measure.
