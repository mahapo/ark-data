[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FI.INDAMBNTALS Lesson Thirtv-five AWAKENING We come now to the second stage of spiritual unfoldment, which is the awakening from the dream of sense, from the nightmare of bondage. The first stage represented by I(ey 15, is therealization of the nature of bondage and the perception that it is, after all, only a bad dream. Key 16 is obviously a picture of destruction. But notice that the source of the destructive power is the sun, and that the disintegrating force comes forth as a flash of lightning. This refers to the flash of superconsciousness which constitutes the first awakening. It is the first moment of clear vision, after which the pelson to whom it comes is never again quite the same as he lvas before. Like the hatching of a chick from the egg, another life opens before it. So it is with man. At the moment of sudden illunination, which is pictured by I(ey 16, he receives an initiation, and from there on he belongs to a new order ofcreatures. In THE BOOI( OF TOKENS, the meditation on the letter Peh to which Key 16 is attributed, says: \"Verily, destruction is the foundation of existence, And the tearing-down thou seest Is but the assembling of material For a grander structure.\" Destluction is really the basis of existence. Our entire lives are spent in the disintegration of forms for the sake of building up other forms. Power is released by disintegration. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the automobiles we ride in, are all in process of destruction from the first moment we put them to use. In the act of destruction itself lies all the utility we can extract from any of these things. (In the material universe, the second law of thermo- dynamics postulates that all forms of energy are derived fi'om the destruction of some previously existing physical or energy structure. Entropy is the word used in physics to describe this down-grading process. Ed.) usa300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS 35 In the experience of spiritual unfoldrnent, awakening is clistinctly a destructive process. All the customary wrong thinking and wrong acting must go. The false sense of personal will, or personal autonomy, of personal self-action, must be utterly destroyed. This is not a comfortable process. When one is forced to recognize the truth that some of his most cherished beliefs are false, the consequent readjustment is not easy. yet the wise in every age have testified that this destruction is essentially a gathering of materials for a grander structure. (All tme scientists must stand ready at any time to discard even their most deep-rooted convictions when competent observation ancl experiment . . . \"new awakening,, in the sense of this text . . . show such beliefs to be inconsistent with newly established facts. As this is written, the Law of Parity a cornerstone of physical science, upp.urc about to fall. Ed.) The first chaptel of the Gospel according to St. John says: \"In the beginning was the Worcl, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Hirn; and without Him was not anything made that was made. That which hath been made was life in Him, and the life was the light of men.', This passage refers to the power you have been studying since the first lesson of SEVEN STEPS. You have learned that this power is not only the source of the forces used in creation, integration and reproduction, but that from it spring also the forces rnanifest in the opposites of these. THE BOOK OF TOKENS, in the meditation on Peh which means \"the mouth of man as organ of speech,\" states: \"I aln the mouth whence issueth the breath of Life; I am the all-devouring one Whereunto all things retllm.\" This is the power which is active in the disintegration of the old fonns of personal consciousness. It rends the veil which hides truth fi'om our eyes. The doctrine that this brealcing-down of form is frrndamental in the process of the Life-power's self-manifestation deserves most careful consideration. A practical occultist has to learn that he cannot hope to reach any goal he may have set for himself without first breaking down the conditions in which he finds himself whel he formulates his desire. In occultism, as in everything else, we cannot have our cake and eat it too. Before we may find release from the chains which bind us, we must leam how to break them. The time to begin this plocess of breaking down the old, limiting forms is now, not some time in the fliture. You have already made a good start. You are aware of your limitations. you"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS: 35 are making an effod to transcend them. This is witnessed by the fact that you have followed the instruction this far'. As you proceed with it, other practical methods for combating your limitations will be given you, and things of splendor will unfold within you. Your first step is to apply in your daily life the principles represented by the Tarot Keys so as to build those principles into the structure of your own being. The number 16 says as much. Right discrimination, the principle represented by Key 6, is necessary in this work. Apply this principle through acts of concentration typified by l(ey 1, and you will find that each day's experience brings you some measure of the awakening so strikingly pictured here. Superficial observation will not suffice. You must give attention to the mealing of your thoughts, desires and actions. Thus you apply the plinciple of limitation to overcome the forms of limitation which constitute your present bondage. He who is proficient in concentration rarely places himself in embarrassing situations by rash and unconsidered action. He thinks before he acts and then acts wisely. The planet Mars is r-elated to l(ey 16 through the letter Peh, and in exoteric astrology Mars is the planet of war and of r.ash action. Yet it is also the planet of the driving force behind all successful activity. The way the Mars force manifests itself in us depends therefore, on whether we direct it so as to make ftill use of its clriving power, or whethet we permit it to control us, thus inducing rash and foolish activity. The Mars force is the propulsive energy which drives our desires into manifestation. Direction of desire is not repression. No one lacking powerful desires and emotions ever attails to tire heights of mastery. When one tries to repress the Mars fotce, it sooner or later breaks loose in a bru'st of tenific destruction. Books on analytical psychology tell of many honible examples of human wreckage caused by the repression of desire. The charurels thlough which desire force finds expression are normally undel our conscious control. It is natural and proper to manage the desire nature. I(ey 1, th.e Magician, shows how. Formulate your desires, using intelligent discrimination, and then bring them into nalifestation by concentration. Malce your mental irnages of the desired results sharp and clear so that subconsciousness will receive definite impressions. Then the activity of the dynamic Mars force will make your dleams come true. Sonre very old versions of I(ey 16 arenamed \"The House of God.\" Others are called \"The Fire of Heaven.\" Still others bear the title, \"The Lightning-struck Towel'.\" The title in our version is a short form of this third variant. There is a tradition that it refers to the Tower of Babel ancl thus to the confusion of tongues. Readers familiar with the figurative use of the worcl \"Babel\" i1the wlitings of Jacob Boehme, and in other productions of the Inner School of Western Occultism, will understand how to interpret the title, \"The l{ouse of God'\" Here us?300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAA,IENTALS: 35 too, is a clue to the channels through which the doctrine symbolized in Tarot came into Europe fiom fafther East. Specifically, the title we use is related to the notion of speech. The Bible story about the Tower of Babei indicates that it is a mistaken use of language to try to reach heaven by meals o1'a structure of words. The correct use of language is to direct the forces of nature by rnaking words the tools of organized thought.
