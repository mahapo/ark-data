[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMBNTALS Lesson Thirty-eight THE STAR 'I'llE GREAT yellow star is the Blazing Star of Masonic symbolism. lt stands for the Quintessence (fifth essence) o1'the alchemists. This is clearly indicated by the star's eight plincipal rays. Ihe eight-spoked designs on the dress of the Fool, the Wheel of Fortune, and this eiglit-rayed star, are all emblems of the Quintessence which is Spirit, the power behind the energy transmitted to their world-systems by suns, The star has also eight short secondary rays. fhese rays are fully developed in the symbolism of I(ey 19. The seven lesser stars are also eight-rayed to show that they are manifestations of the same Qr,rintesscnce. They represent also the seven alchemical metals; lead, iron, tin, gold, silver, copper and mercury. These correspond to the seven astrological planets; Saturn, Mars, .Tupiter, Sun, Moon, Venus and Mercury. Thus the stars o1'I(ey 17 are symbols for the seven interior stars called \"chakras\" by yogis, which are centers through which the One Force manifests itself in the human bodv. The above is a forerunner to instruction you will receive in later lessons. You will then be told more concerning these centers, and will learn practical methods for utilizing the forces wiriclr work tl-rough them. For the present, this is work for which you are not sufficiently prepared. Coticerning the development of these centers, much has been published. Much of the material fbuncl in books is dangerous because it gives technical knowledge to persons who are not clualiliecl to use it, so they often do themselves grave injuries. Worse even than this are those books which fill the mincl of the student with a lot of time-wastins nonsense o{'which he must ricl himself befbre he can receive senuine instruction. We relirse to enter into argument with persons who cannot see the need for keepirrg secret certain aspects of occult instruction. They cannot receive the l<nowledge they clamor for-nor will they find it until they become wise enough to see how vitally necessary is the old rule of soorecy. Thus we frankly admit tiiat in these lessons we hold back not a little, in accordance r.r'ith ancient usage which we f'eel to be binding on us. On the other hand, we give yoll no \"blincls\" of false interpretation, nor do we waste your time with fruitless plactices. When you have taken these preliminary steps in your training, detailecl explanation of more advanced work r,vill be available under suitable reserves.

She represents truth, and the practioe of rneditation reveals truth to us without disguise, hence she is nude. Fler legs are bent so that each forms an angle of 90 degrees. 90 is the nnmber of the letter Tzaddi, and an angle of 90 degrees is an ancient symbol lbriLrstice and rectitr\"rde. The wcight of her body rests on her lefl knee and is supported by earth, representing the facts of physical existence. IJer balance is maintained by her right leg, and her right foot rests on the surl'ace of the pool. This means that in meditation something occurs which gives to the usLrally unstable mind-stuff, symbolized by water, a solidity and stability like that of the physical world. Here is a hint of what alchemists mean when they speak of the \"flxation of the volatile\". 'l'he two vases ale the two personal mocies of consciousness, like the two ministers in l(ey 5, or the man ancl woman in l(ey 6. The ellipses on the sides of the vases represent the zero sign, symbol of Spirit and o1'1he \"Akasha Tattva\". Only two ellipses are shown, but there are really four to signify the expression of Spirit through the four worlds and the four elements. Fr'om the vase in the woman's right hand falls a stream which sets up waves in the pool. The waves are concentric rings, like the circies on Key 10. These waves represent the activity set r-rp in subconsciousness by rneditation. From the o'.hcr vrsc o sticai.ir falls on larid, ivhcrc it js dilitlcd iiito tir,'c pai',s. This icpi'cscnis the pulilication and perfection of thc five senses by means of meditation. Two important clues to the rneaning of I(ey 17 are that the woman lifts the vases, and the water comes fiom the pooi and goes back to the source whence it came. The mountain in the bacl<ground is the same as the one in Keys 6 and 8. It represents the perfection of the Great Work, which is man's conscious control of the inorganic forms of the I-ife-power's self--expression. 'fhis control begins with man's mastery of his owr mind and body so that they become open channels for the outflow of the higher aspects of the Life- poweL's true consciousness. Whcn this prelirninary work with the personal vehicle is completed, then becomes possible the culmination of the Operation of the Sun. This is the actual mastery of the patterns of the inorganic world by what appears to the uninitiated as a mysterious, miracle-working power of the adept. The adept himself, however, knows that this power is latent in all men, and he sceks eagerly fbr those who are ready to begin the journey to the mountain-peak of mastery. The tree in the middle distance refers to the human nervous system, which occult diagrams often typify as a tree. The upper part of this tree stands fbr the brain, ar:rd the trunk represents the spinal cord, the sympathetic nerves, and the ganglia o1'the sympathetic system.

Here in i{ey 17 the bird of l{ennes reminds us that meditation is begun by, and supervised by, the sel{-conscious aspect of human personality pictured in T'arot by Key 1,'fhe Magician. Orr the diagrarn of the Cube of Space, the line corresponding to the letter Tzaddr and to I(ey 17 is the line South-Above, which is the southern boundary of the upper face of tire cube. This upper face is represented in Tarot by the Magician, and since the line corresponding to I(cy 17 is the southern boundary of tliis face, we see that Key 17 must represent the southern half of i(ey 1 where we see a table with the implements of ceremonial magic. Celcmonial magic itself is one fonn of meditation because everything done in a magical ccremonial is intended to emphasizethe central idea, or seed thought, of the ritual. In this conneotion, review Lesson 6. We shall now indicate the direction of the currents of energy in the twelve boundary lines of tho Cube of Space. In the diagrams accompanying Lesson 18, some of thcse are shown in Irigure 1. You can add the others to Figure 2. In the line North-East (I(ey 4), the current moves down'uvard fiom Above to Below. In the line South-East (I(ev 5). jt rnoves upward from Below to Above. In the line Easf-Abo've (Key 6), it moves from South to Norlh as may be seen by careful inspection of the symbols on that l(ey. In the line East-Below (Key 7), it moves from North to South like the river in the picture . fhus it is possible to trace a continuous line round the boundaries of the eastern face of the cube, beginning with Key 4 from Above to Below, then through the line East-Below from North to South, then from Below to Above up the line South-East, and fiom the South-East upper corner, through the line East-Above, back to the North-East upper corner. OIr the North face of the cube it is impossible to trace a continuous line, for the current in the lines North-Above (Key 8) and North-Below (I(ey 9), moves in both lines from East to West; and the outtent in the line North-West (Key l1) moves, like the current in the line North-East (I(ey 4), from Above to Below. It is intpossible also to trace a continuous path round the western f-ace, because although the lirre South-West carries a current fiom Below to Above (Key 13), the lines West-Above and West-ilelow both caffy currents from North to South (Keys 14 and 15). On the Llpper face of the cube however, we may trace a continuous line, starting from any corncr, for llast-Above (I(ey 6) moves liom South to North; North-Above (Key 8) carries a U50300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TA1IO7' III]NDAA,IENT'A],5 38 current from East to West; West-Above (Key 14) runs from North to South; and South-Above (Key l7) carries a current fiom West to East. No continuous line may be traced round the lower face because the lines East-Below and West-Below both move from North to South. Nor may a continuous line be drawn round the southern face because the lines South-East and South-West both move frorn Below to Above; and the line South-Below, like the line South-Above, carries a ourrent from West to East Note that the line South-Above (l(ey 17) begins at the upper end of the line South-West (I(ey I3) and runs back to the upper end of the line South-East (I(ey 5). Thus this line does actnally.join the line of Nr-rn, the fish, to that of Vav, the hook (See Lesson3T). Observe also that the curent from the line West-Above (Key 14) and that from the line South- West (I(ey 13) meet at the point where the line South-Above begins. This indicates that the forces represented by l(eys 13 and 14 are blended in Key 17. In every act of right meditation the secret force of Scorpio is airned by the arrow of Sagittarius. Furthermore, since the line corresponding to l(ey 17 ends at the upper point of the line corresponding to Ke1' 5, and the currcnt in the latter moves upward, it is evident that the folce carried by I(ey 17 cannot move dou'nward against the current in the iine South-East. What ocolus is that, at thc cnd of a successful period of rleditation, orre receives, i\"hrough the activity pictured by the Flierophant, a revelation of some eternal principle which bears directly on one's problern and leads to its solution. After this has occurred, the current fiom the line South-Above passes into the line East- Abot e, symbolized by I(ey 6. The revelation we receive at the end of a successful meditation becomes part of the conscious awarelless of the person mcditating. This additional enlightenment then contributes to the exercise of discliminatior.r pictured by I(ey 6. At this time we shall not follow the course of the cube boundaries fartirer. Yet the alert reader will be able to make his own discoveries by applying the principles outlined. Finally, think well upon this passage from the BOOK OF TOI(ENS. It contains an important secret concerning I{ey 17. 'Ihinkest thou, O seeker for wisdom, That thou bringest thyself into the Lighl I3y thine own search'?

Entering that sphere, They must die to their old selves Even as a fish cast uporr the land must die! Yet do they die only to live again, And what befbre seemed life to them, Now weareth the asoect of deatl-r. Men think they seek me, But it is I who seek them.

DIVINE WISDOM SOLVES PROBLEMS With Tarot Key 17 we come to definite application of eternal truth to the every-day problems that reat'against us. Iivery bit of B. O. T. A. instruction is intensely practical. As you tread the occult path, you will find this knowledge the reverse of nebulous theory. It is knowledge tl-rat you can put to work, and you will find it alrvays works if you work it. By rneans of it you will know and experience fuifillment in the deepest sense. First of all, seek the Divine Order which is the true \"kingdom of heaven within you\". Then seel< the expression of the Order in wisdom, love, power, peace, health, riches, or whatever other form your heart desires. All things are good. There is only one basic requirement. You mLtst seek in order to be able to share. Your desire must be truly constructive, and must zrlways take into account the fact that you are a unit of human society. This I(ey, the Star, is specifically related to meditation. Yet we like to have you think of it as pointing the way to the correct solution of every problem, big or little, complex or sirnple. T'hc principlcs that are emphasized by I(ey 17 are universal. Tliey apply to all humanity. Put thern to work, and you can receive definite ancl correct answers to anything that perplexes you. { ts'0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"'ftl llOT I; Ll At DA A4 11N'l't1 LS. 38 The letter on this card, Tzaddi, is the fishJrook, symbol of the specific means whereby you nrzry get right answers to your questions. This is the fish-hook of silent contemplation. Each o1'us must ttse it for himself. So to say, we must angle for the fish-that is, fbr the right answer, the correct solution. Wherc shall we angle'/ The number of the letter gives us a hint. It is 90, and 90 is the value ol the naffle of tl-re letter on I(ey 12, the letter Mem, meaning \"water\". Wtat is this water? l{ight here we could write pages and pages. Indeed, rve have already written at great length about occult \"water\" in a lesson frtr the course on alchemy. Now, however, it is enough to say tliat this \"water o1'life\" is the universal mind- stuff which is the First Matter of alchemy; and it is to be found inside us. Each personal sr-rbconscious mind is like a bay in the cosmic mental ocean. In that bay swim the fish (ideas) for which we must ansle. Divine Wisdom has no problems. [t already knows all the answers. .lust as you put bait on a hook, and jr\"rst as each kind of bait attracts its own appropriate kind of fish, so does the bait of yolrt present problern have a special attraction for' the special fish of Divine Wisdorn which will give y'ou the right answer. Your part is to bait the hook by formulating your questions clearly. 'fhcn like a good fisherman, you must be still until the fish takes the bait, tliat is, until you begin to get some icleas. This is the simple essence of meditation. First, choosing a problem. Second, fbrmulating a clear-cut cluestion (baiting the hooli). Third, casting the hook into the bay of inncr cor.rscior-rsness. Irourth, patient r,vaiting until you fbel a nibble. 'I'lris practice has other consequences. Being perfectly still helps to synchronrze the activities of certain inner centers of force, symbolized in Key 17 by the stars grouped round the large central star. These are the same as the seven \"chakras\" of the yogis, the seven seals of the Book of Life, and the seven metals of alchemy. They corespond to seven major whorls of lbroe in your body. Purified and concentrated thought helps to synchronize these whirling forces. A rhythm is establishcd which attunes us to the greater rhythm of the Cosrnic Order. In consequence, poisc and balance are established because personality is by this attunement perfectly adjusted to thc rhythms of Mother Nature, the hneeling woman of this i(ey. She is eternally poised, eternally balanced. She rests on a physical basis, the land, but she balances herself with a fbot that rests on the srrface of the pool. Wren we achieve stillness, we ourselves do not meditate, we merely participate in the eternal cosmic meditation which lifts the veils hiding the beautif'ul perfection of the Divine Mother. t_t.\\0300"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TAI]OT IITI NI)AA4ENT'AI.S.. 38 Thus we make no attempt to concentrate directly on the body centers. Except under the personal direction of a master teacher (and master teachers do not give public instruction), such concentration, though it often does force centers to open, does not do it in an orderly way. Seldom do real master teachers permit their personal pupils to engage in this dangerous practice. For the ordinary student it will only release a flood of energy he cannot contlol, ancl rvhich will ahnost certainly iniure him. This is like blowing a breach in the wall of a clam. The pent-up energy will rush forth, but it will only wreak havoc. Right meditation is like turning the water through the proper channels into the turbines. lfere is a word to the wise. Sce that you heed it! Iror similar reasons, avoid trick breathings. Simply watch your breathing to makc sure that you establish the habit of breathing deeply, rhythmically, and quietly. One hears people tlyitig to meditate while they puff like locomotives on a grade-and, lil<e the puffing locomotive, they are apt to lose traction. Thus all their wheels spin madly without getting them a foot ahead. When we tell you to ireep mentally and physically still, we mean, among other things, that yott must not try to grapple with your problem. That is exactly like a fisherman making a cast and hooking himself in the seat of the pants. And don't continually \"iiggle your hook\". I(ecp still. I'hese fish are scared away by mental or physical fussiness. Don't bother to wonder what will come, or whether you're meditating correctly. All there is to it is quiet, steady contemplation of the problem as formulated in the question. When yott do get a bite, land your fish! Keep your paper and pencil handy, and as soon as an idea strikes, get a good loolc at it by writing it down. Sometimes just a word. Sometimes you u'ill get sentences, paragraphs, pages. More often than not, wlrat you get won't be what you expected. For in meditation you are, most of the time, like one fishing for a species of hsh he has never seen. You don't know the answer. That's why you meditate. Why, then, be amazed whctr you fincl the answer diflererrt fiom the frantic guesses ivhich got you nowhere? A1l who solve problems successfully use this method to some extent. We are giving yolr an opportt-rnity to carry it much farther than do most. Always precede your meditation by loolcing at I(ey 17. Just let your mind soak it up through your eyes. Then follow the simple directions. You will get results! t.t:;0 3 00"}]
