[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUI\\DAMENTALS Lesson Forty-three REALIZATION I{ey 20 shows the sixth stage of spiritual unfbldment in which the personal consciousness is on the verge of blending with the universal. At this stage the adept realizes that his personality is nothing but a manifestation of thc relation between self'- consciousness and subconsciousness. He sees\" also. that self- r:onsciousness and subconsciousness are not themselves personal, but are modes of universal consciousness. He knows that in reality his personality has no separate existence. At this stage, his intellectual conviction is confirmed by a fourth- dimensional experience which blots out the delusion of personal separateness. The nurnber 20 has already gained special significance for you as the number of the letter l(aph to which Key 10, the Wheel of Fortune, is assigned. Thus 20 is for yoll a number symbolizing grasp, or comprehension. This iclea is basic in connection with Key 20, because in this i(ey we see the result of completing the cycie of manifbstation represented by the Wheel. In thc lessons on I(cy 10, it was pointed out that hurnanity at large is yet in the position of Hermanubis and that the completion of the Great Work consists in the extension of the light of intelligence through that segment of the Wheel which is rnarked by the letter Yocl. ln other r,vords, when man comprehends his true nature, he sees that this nature is identical with the One Reality, the One Will, of which the universe is a manifestation. Then he says, \"I have no wili but to do the will of Hirn that sent me.\" Or-r the other hand, he hnows that Will. He knows it as a will to freedom, as a will to joy, as a will to abundance. Ile knows that it is a will to good, to the impartation of every good and pcrfect gift. He comprehencls it as the Will lr,hich has its expression in all activity. I{ere and now he sees tirat Will expresses no lack, no disease, no failure, no poverty. I{e grasps the truth tl-rat whatever appearances of evil surround us, they seem as they do because we are not vet seeing the true relations."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":",f,4 RO7' I; UN DA A,1 [)NT'A LS : 4 3 For such an one, daily experience is a succession of miracles. When we begin to see the light, it is like the lightning-flash of I(ey 16. Wrile it lasts, it breaks down structures of'error and shows all existence as it really is. Then the darkness of ignorance closes in again and we have to wait lbl the next flash. In thc state represented by I(ey 20, however, there is perpetual recognition of the power of Spirit. Thus 20, reacl fiom units to tens, expresses the operation of the No-Thing through memory, or the working of the Fool's vision through the law of the I-ligh Priestess. Here there is freedom fi'orn the lapses of memory which assail us earlier in the work. Moment by moment, without cessation, we see the truth and live it. With this recognition comes a new kind of consciousness. We do not sleep any more. Our bodies are put to rest, but we remain awake, able to firnction consciously in the fburth dimension so that we actually do \"serve God day and night\", in the ranks of the Great Companions. 'I'his is one of the meanings of conscious immortality. The writer of these pages testifies to lris certerin lcnowledge that this is an experience shared by thousands of perfectly normal men and women. To be unconscious eight hours out of the twenty-four is as unnecessary as to wear a gas-mask in ordinary air. We are immortal ancl whetlier we know it or not, we can function consciously while our bodies sleep. 'fhe greater number of persons, however, do not recall their nocturnal experiences because they have uoi yet developed tire physical instruments for recording them. Once this power of recalling the experieuce is developed, it becomes possible to plan a whole night's work and rccolleotion of it will be part of the day's activities. Until this is known experimentally, no hnman language can convey the alteration it makes in one's life. The IJebrew letter Shin (U) means \"tooth\", or \"fang\". In its {brm this letter resembles three tortgues of llame rising fiom a fiery base. Thus the element of fire is attributed to this, the third and last of the Flebrew Mother letters. Tl-re sound of the letter, \"sh!\" is an admonition to silence, understood by all men. So, but more emphatic, is the sharper hiss of which this letter is also a sign in Hebrew. 'Ihus Shin corresponds by sound to the occult counsel: \"Be Silent.\" Serpents, everywhere recognized as symbols of Wisdom, are silent, subtle creatures. Jesus told his disciples to be wise as serpents, thus indicating, fbr those who had ears to hear, his agreement with the ancient doctrine o1'the importance of silence. Evidently then, in beginning our study of the letter Shin, we are approaching a deep wisdom, which has always been reserved, something about which we must keep silence. It is not because I(nowers of the Secret are niggardly with their spiritual possessions that they observe the rule of silence. Nor do they keep silence because any order of beings higher than man imposes a censorship on speech. Neither is silence observed by the wise because the Great Arcanum is dangerous. The reason for silence is thus phrased by Lao-tze: Lts0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7'AROT ItUNDAMENT'ALS: 43 \"The Tao which is the subiect of discussion is not the true 'l'ao.\" We may compare this with a statement of the alchemists which is really negative, though its wording, seems to be positive. 'l'hcy say: \"Our matter has as mal1y names as there are things in this world; that is why the foolish know it not,\" Thc Great Secret simply cannot be told. To try to tell it, therefore, is utter folly. The wise waste no tinte, invite no misconception, expend no energy in vain endeavors to tell. When they clo speak, it is not to impart the secret, but to point out the way. On tl-re other hand, they who know the Secret are forever telling it, not only by their words, but also by their lives. 'fhus a correspondent r,vrites: \"How strzrnge that though i had read the same staternent hundleds of times, it is only now that I perceive it!\" As when we leam a foreign tongue, so it is with the speech of the wise. At first the words are rleaningless noises. 'fhen we apprehend some of the meanings. If we persist in our study, a day arrives when not only the dictionary definitions of the words, but also the subtle connotatiotts and implications no lexicographer may hope to capture, are conveyed to us jn the very same words which meant nothing in the beginning. So it is with thcse Tarot studies, where not only the written word, but also the more expr.essive language of'piotorial syurbols, is used to cornmunicate the mysteries. We must again remind )'ou that in these lessons vou are qiven hevs rvhicl, u'ill open the doors of the prison of iguorance and admit you to the freedom of the True World. The language of symbol is the corlmon speech of the inhabitants of that True World. All tongues of mankind are but poor trarnslations fi'om it. In old versiotts of 'I'arot, as in ours, Key 20 is invariably named.iudgement. On the surface this ref'ers to that day which theologians regard as being afar offl-the clay when all souls shall be.jtrdged; but this is a veil for the real meaning. Judgment is the consequence of weighing evidencc. I-lence Justice is always represented by the scales and in ancient Egyptian pictures of the judgment oI'the soul, the candidate's heart was put in the balances to be weigl-re<J against the t-eather of \"Maat\", or truth. Again, judgment implies estirnation or measurement. One rnight say that the Great Arcanum answers the question, \"How much do you weigh?\" We have to see that since all that is real in us is idcntical with the One Thing, our true weight must be the same as Its weight. George Br,rrnell has expressed this beautifully in liis axiom: \"Truth is that which is; there cannot be that which is not. Thercfore that which is, or Truth. must be all there is.\" When the rveight of the heart . . . the central consciousness in illal1. . . coffesponds to the r,veight of the feather of truth, then the scales of.iuclgment are balanced.

The sages forever say: \"Come now, let us reason together.\" St. Paul, writing of the giving up of the false sense of personality, calls it a reasonable sacrifice. 'l'he Chaldean Oracles bid us to join works to sacred reason. Thus in the symbols of I(ey 20 we shall find many ref-erences to tlre number 4,the Tarot number particularly associated with reason. Yct, since a.judgment is a reasoned conclusion, and reasoning leads to that conclusion, juclgment is also the end of reasoning. In Key 20, reasoning has come to its term and a new order of knowing is manifested. Old things have passed away through the operation of the law pictured by I(ey 13 which is the agency of the principle of right discrimination pictured by l(ey 6. 'fhere is no more weighing of evidence, no more discussion of pros and cons, no more argllment 1br or against. That is all done with and in the picture we shall find abundant witness to this. Irinally, a.judgment is a decision. It has direct consequences in action. Note that word \"clecision\" and its derivation from a Latin root meaning \"to cut\". In this you have the same hint that is given by the correspondence of the letter Shin to a Hebrew word meaning \"separation\". The Jttdgment cuts off forever our connection rvith tlie false knowleclge of \"this worlcl.\" It puts an end to our limitation to three-clirnensional consciousness. It termiuates our sense of mortality. Thr-rs in a llible proniise dir\"ectly related to ihis doctrine of Judgrnent, w-e reacl: \"They shail hunger no more, neither thirst any more.\" To have done with all this misery. Nothing less. That is the promise, and to have done with it forever. Not a makeshift alleviation. A devourins flame of realization which consumes the whole brood of lies. 'fhis week practice silence. Speak as little as you can. Keep your emotions under control and above all try to make your thoughts quiet. You will soon realize that this conserves enelgy for useful endeavors. Continue this practice the rest of your life. us0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"7'tROT tt{t NDAA4EN't'At,,\\. 43 COLORING II\\STRUCTIONS I(BY 20.
