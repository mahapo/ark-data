[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNIDAMENTALS Lesson Twenty-eight T}IE IIANGED MaN The gallows fiom which the Hanged Man is suspended is shaped like a Hebrew letter Tav. Each upright line of the letter is a tree-trunk having six lopped branches. They coruespond to tlre twelve signs of the zodiac and thus they typify the twelve astrological types of personality. In the state of mental reversal symbolized by I(ey 12, personal peculiarities are reduced to a minimum (the branches are lopped), and emphasis falls on the Inner Self, the true Spiritual Identity. The correspondence of the gallows to the letter Tav takes us ahead in the Tarot series to the last I(ey bearing the number 21, for this Key represents the esoteric significance of Tav. In the state of Samadhi, or the suspension of personal consciousness, an adept in concentration becomes aware of the real nature of the universe. This is depicted by Key 21, named The World. Ti; icversc one's tnetttal aiiitude is to have a irew woriti-view wirich sees the universe as a dance of life, full of joy and fieedom. Furlhermore, the suspension of the Hanged Man from the letter Tav intimates that, in the state of consciousness represented here, one realizes the utter dependence of personality on the universal lif'e. That uriversal life, moreover. is understood to be the perfectly adequate support of personality. Water reverses by reflection all images thrown upon it and Key 12 is related to water. Also 12,the number of this Key, is a reversal of the number 21 which is assigned to the l(ey named The World about which you will learn later on in this series of lessons. This indicates that Samadhi, or that state of consciousness in which Reality is directly perceived (depicted in I(ey 21 as the World Dancer) is the reverse of the state of restriction or bondage depicted in I(ey 12. In Samadhi, the personal vehicle is in a state of motionless trance. The physical body is cold, the heart-beat slow, and the respiration almost imperceptible. All the organic functions are in a state of suspension. This is only the outward seeming. Interiorly, an adept in this state of consciousness experiences the bliss of union with the Central Reality of the universe. 'l'hat Central Reality is a lbcus of intense activity, though itself'at rest. Here the limitations of language force us into the use of paradox. Yet what we have said is the report of the wise who have had the experience no words can describe. t.ts0300"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"7',,1 ROT Itt/N D,4 hIENTA LS: 2B Again, the letter Tav is associated with the direction Center. It is said to be the Ter-nple of I{oliness which stands in the midst, supporting the six directions of space represented by the six I'aces of a cube as shown in the diagrarns which accompany Lesson 18. Thus Key 12, showing the Hanged Man supported by a letter Tav, indicates that the state of Samadhi is one o1'union with the supporting Center of all tliings. Mem, being one of the three Mother letters, is attributed to one of the three co-ordinate lines clefining the Cube of Space. This line is the one connecting the center of the eastern face with the center of the western face. Mem is attribr.rted to this line because Mem is the Mother letter corresponding to the element of water. The \"water\" is the stream of substance which flows from the mental oris.ins represented by the direction East and I(ey 3. The final lbrm of the letter Mem, used at the end of Hebrew words, is E. In the Cube of Space, this is attributed, along with Tav, to the interior center of the cube where it is a symbol of the completion of the Great Work by the adept's conscious union with the Central Self.

The system thus brought into expression is symbolized in Tarot by I(ey 10 which represents the direction West. IJere we touch on another occult doctrine. It is often objected that the practice of concentration leading to Samadhi is a selfish procedure. Persons who labor under the impression that nobody does anything unless his muscles are involved in action sneer at the motionless recluse, seated in his retreat, and accuse him of heartless escape fiom the responsibilities of li fe. It must be conf'essed that a certain type of quietist mysticism is open to this criticism. There are pelsolls who seek escape Ii'om reality by mystic practices, j ust as there are other persons who try to avoid reality by rushing madly from one form of occupation to another. A true adept is never idle, even though his body may be in a state of motionless trance. True Samadhi is union with the sustaining principle of all manifestation, and a sage in this condition is actually sharing the burden, the responsibility, and the joy of cosmic administration, Thus we find that to the letter Tav is attributed the Administrative Intelligence which directs and associates the motions of the planets, directing them all in their propcr courses. u:i0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"7'ARO7'FUNDAMENTAI.S 28 'l'hc legs of the Hanged Man form an inverted figure 4. This number refers to Reason. His bocly and arms fot'm, with his head, an inverted triangle corresponding to the number 3. The symbolism here is a correct statement of the situation depicted. The practices which lead to mental reversal are based on rational grasp of the principles of Reality, among them being the necessary real presence of the Universal Life of God at the center of human pelsonality. This grasp is a reasoned consequence of the truth that Gocl, being omnipresent, must be present at every point in space. 'fhis realization is the result of subconscious response to the seed-idea that the Divine Plesence must logically be thought of as being central in human personality. 'Ihis idea is a suggestion which subconsciousness elaborates. In response to it are effected subtle physiological changes which set going the f'unctions of the higher brain centers. Through their activity, which begins as no more than a rational grasp of the principle, there comes an ccstatic experience of the Real Presence of the I AM. To the glory of this experience every great mystic has bome witness. The 4 over the 3 shows also the subordination of imagination to reason. Most persons permit reason to be dominated by imagination. A few have discovered that reason can determine what mental images shall occupy the held of attention, These few imagine creatively, and their imagery is governed by their rnental vision of the place of human personality in the cosmic order. Mcrst persons merely lationalize their uncontrolled imaginations, which arc at the mercy of race thclught and of suggestions engendered by external appearances. Not so the adept pictured in I(ey 12. I.Iis subconsciousness is always under the direction of the reasoning self'- cottsciousness. He is not the slave of moods, nor swayed by race-thought. When others are tossed about by ternpests of passion, he remains unmoved. The Constituting Intelligence pictured in Tarot by the Emperor is the ruling principle in every detail of his life-experience. Ry clear mental vision he sees: I'hat there is only One Power. 'fhat the One Power is centered everywhere. That the One Power is therefore the central fact behind every mask of personality. 'I'hat, consequently, whatever is done, apparently by some human being, is really zrccomplished by the One Power which acts through that person and, since the same power is the energy which takes form in all the immensity o1'manifestation we call the \"Lutiverse\", it must be true tlrat whatever seems to be done by a person is actually performed by the sum-total of cosmic forces operating by rneans of the personal instrument. 1. 2. a A ( r,s0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7'A]lO7' 1;UNDAA4ENTALS: 28 The l-langed i\\4an's jacket is blue like the robe of the I'Iigh Priestess. This color is attributed to the element of water. The lunar crescents forming the pockets of the coat are also related to subconsciousness because their shape is connected with the moon, attributed to the High Priestess. They are shown as pockets to emphasize the idea that subconsciousness is the container of the powers and stored-up experiences which are the equipment of personality. These pockets, the ten buttons, and the trimming of the jacket, are of silver, the metal of the moon, to give ILrrther emphasis to the iclea we have just mentioned. The ten buttons are also an allusion to the ten aspects o1'the Life-power which Qabalists term Sephiroth, or numerations.

The racliant halo surrounding the Hanged Man's head suggests that he is an embodiment of the One Light. To calry out this suggestion, his hair is white, like the hair of the Emperor and the Ilermit. This means that the Hanged Man, even though his face be young, is to be identified with the Ancient of Davs. Below his head, the ground is hollowed out, as by a watercourse. l'his is a firrther leference to the letter Mem. All that palt of his head from the eyes to the top of the skull is actually below the surface of the soil from which spring the trees. Thus we are shown that his vision and his brain functions are active below the surface. This is what differentiates an adept from most persons. He sees through the surface of things.

To attain to any degree of illumination, he must turn away from the materialistic concept of life.

A practical occultist is one who has trained himself to live from and by this hidden inner principle of perfection. Trained himself to attribute all action to That, and to That alone. Trained hirrself to deny every appearance to the contrary. -[his training begins in the conscious mind as rational understanding of the truth that the omnipresence of Spirit means the actual, real presence of First Cause at the heart of every human personality.

The truth is that a \"recl\" object has chemical properties which make it absorb everything but red rays from whatever light shines on it. Contrive to eliminate the red rays fi'om the light-source and the appearance of the object will be black. So, through all our daily experience, truth reverses appearance and gives the lie to popular opinions based on the looks of things. A practical occultist can work \"miracles\" because he has established himself in knowledge that the real Worker within him is Omnipotence-not his limited personality. LIis training does not give him powers. It enables him to become an unobstructed channel for the One Power that accomplishes everything.
