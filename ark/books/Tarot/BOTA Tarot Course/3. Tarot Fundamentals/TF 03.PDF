The Absolute is THAT conceming which nothing may be positively affirmed. We cannot define it because it transcends our comprehension. We may call it the Rootless Root of all being, or the Causeless Cause of all that is, but these words, or any others we may employ, merely point our rninds toward the Absolute without at all adding to our positive knowledge concerning it. To indulge in speculation as to its essential nature is futile. We shali be much better occupied if we consider the ways in which the Absolute manifests itself Among names which have been given to this manit'estation are: Lif-e-power; the One Force; the One Thing; Limitless Light; L. V. X; the Primal Will. Learn these names. They designate the force you use in every thought, in every f-eeling, in every action. To enable you to gain a better practical understanding of the nature and possibilities of this force is the primary object of this instruction. Your advancement will be rreasured strictly by your growing comprehension of the real meaning of these terms. The first syrnbol of the Life-power is 0. Review now the list of its meanings. Do so rnentally if you can. If not, consult the list in Lesson 2. The Life-power is the NO-THING. It is nothing we can define, nothing we can measure. Yet it really is, and it is limitless. 0 looks like an egg, and an egg contains pctencies of growth and development. As a living body is formed inside the shell of an egg and then iratched from it, so is everything in the universe brought into embodirnent rvithin the Cosmic Egg of the Life-polver. Wren this process of ernbodiment is perfected, and only then, it becones possible to achieve the ultirnate liberation, 'uvhich is union with the Absoiute itself. But this attainment is far beyond our present objective which is to make the best possible use of the potencies of the Life-power lvithin the limits of the \"Ring Pass-Not\" symbolized by the outline of the zero sign. The Life-power has within it all possibilities. All manifestation, every object, every force in the universe, is an adaptation of the one Life-porver. Because its possibilities are truly limitless, it may be specialized in any particular form of expression the human mind can clearly conceive. Many extlaordinary results may be achieved by purely mental means. Because the Life-power is the force behind growth and development, it is obviously the cultural power. This is intimated by the attribution of the letter Aleph to this Key. Aleph means \"bull\" or \"ox\". Oxen were the motive-power in the early civilizations where the alphabet of occultism was invented. They were used to plow fields, to thresh grain, and to cany burdens. Agriculture is the basis of civilization, hence the ox represents the power at U50300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAA,TENTALS rn'ork in every activity whereby man makes use of the folces surrounding him, and adapts thenr to the realization of his pllrposes. Oxen themselves are symbols of the taming of natural forces. Every ox begins life as a bull. Thus the letter Aleph is a symbol of creative energy, and of the vital plinciples of living cleatures. This vital principle cortes to us in physical form as the radiant energy of the sun. The Life-power, therefole, is not an abstraction far removed fi'om our every day life. We make contact with it everywhere, in every form. Our senses leveal it to us physically as light and heat from the sun, and modern science has confitmed the truth of the ancient intuition that solar energy is the basis ofphysical existence. Just as sunlight is a mode of electro-magnetic radiation, so is everything else composed of electro-magnetic vibrations. Man's instruments for recording these vibrations have a relatively narow range, even though it does extend far beyond the limits of physical sensation. Yet there is an instrument not made by man which does register the higher vibr-ations of cosmic radiation, and by means of this instrument, those who know how to use it may become aware of, and utilize, the most potent forces in the universe. This ilstrument is human personality which has possibilities far beyond what most persons realize. In ordel to make these possibilities actual human poweLs, the instrument must be rightly adjusted, and, in a sense, cornpleted. For the untrained personality is like a delicate precision tool lacking the completion of some of its parts, and some of the higher functions of iir. hrr** organism cannot be exercised until proper training has brought about actual alterations of its structure. Yet we shall find, when we take up this work, that the whole power of the coslllos is with us in ou1effolts to reach the higher state of unfoldment. The prirnary function of human personality is to give free expression to the highest potencies of the Life-power. (Recall statements 0, I and 2 in The Pattern on the Trestleboard.) A most important form taken by the radiant energy, and the first you should leam to use, is air. You must learn to control it by learning how to breathe. Just learn to take a really deep breath which fills your lungs, by giving free play to the abdominal muscles during the act of inhalation. Remember, you do not have to pull in the breath. Atmospheric pressule takes care of that. You simply have to expand your ribs and the air will rush into your lungs. Do not make the mistake of trying any forcible expansion of the chest. Let the muscles just below the ribs do most of the work. If you do it properly, you will feel the expansion in the small of your back and at the sides, as well as in the front of the body. Lts0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TAI?OT F UNDAA,lLNTALS I(eep in mind the picture of the air penetrating into every part of the lungs so as to provide your blood stream with the oxygen it requires. At first it takes watchful attention to make breathing deep and regular. Consistent practice will establish you in good habits. Make no particular effort to keep up the fullest deep breathing all day long. When you rise in the morning, take four deep breaths. Exhale as completely as you can manage without strain. Remember to exhale before taking the fir'st of these four breaths. During the day, repeat your four breaths at noon, just before the evening meal, and just before going to bed. The rest of the day you need only determine to get full value fiom the act of breathing. Your subconsciousness will attend automatically to the establishment of the proper rhythm. Don't try any trick exercises such as are given in some books purporling to teach the arl of breathing for occult development. Most of these breathing stunts have no practical value. The f-ew which are really useful are also dangerous unless practiced under the snperuision of a skilled teacher competent to judge the condition of the pupil. Listen to your breathing. It should be practically inaudible. If your breathing exercises are noisy, they ale wrong. The remedy is to slow dowr the alternate expansion and contraction of the abdominal muscies. Adhere strictly to the rule of observing four stated periods for taking the deepest possible bleaths. Observe these religiously. The rest of the time, let your subconsciousness do the work. It will, if you make up its mind fbr it by your definite intention. If you are suddenly upset by something, stop for four deep breaths before you try to thiril<, or say, or do anything whatever. The imporlance of breath is shown in the symbolism of the Fool. In Hebrew esotericism, the letter Aleph is the speciai sign for air and for breath. The noun \"fool\", moreover, is derived from the Latin follis, meaning a \"bag of wind\", and to this day we call a noisy, silly person a \"windbag\". Follis also means \"bellows,\" an instrument which uses air to stir up a fire. This is precisely the office of our lungs. The yellow tint in the background of the picture is used in the schools of the Westeln Tradition as a symbol for air. Add to this the fact that in almost every human tongue words which lnean air, wind ol brenth are employed also to designate life and conscious energy. Then you will begin to understand better why occultism stresses the importance of beginning practical work by learning to breathe. The Tarot title for the Life-power is highly ingenious. It tells us what we need to lanow, and at the same time throws the idly curious and the superficial dabblers off the track. us0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDA]VIENTALS: One clue to what Tarot means by \"Fool\" is the saying: \"The wisdom of God is foolishness with rnen.\" Because this is true, the wise men of every generation, who gain unusual knowledge of the Life-power, are often called madmen or fools by their less enlightened brethlen. Thus the title of I(ey 0 hints at a state of consciousness which many rnaterialistic psychologists term abnonnal or even pathological, because they do not understand it. Those who do comprehend its significance call this state superconsciousness, or cosmic consciousness. To enter into this state of consciousness is to arrive at a profound understanding of the cosmic order, and at the same time to become aware of the true significance of what it is to be a human being. This attainment may be legalded as being the ultimate objective of your Talot study. Do not look for miracles. Youl study and practice will help you to organize the forces of youl personality so that it will become an adequate instrument for the expression of slrperconsciousness and for the exercise of powers which belong to this high level of awargness. The only way we can conceive of the Absolute is in terms of our own experience. We cannot help investing it with something of our own human characteristics. This is true of the highest philosophical ideas conceming a Creative Intelligence, just as certainly as it applies to the grossest types of anthropomorphism. Hence the Fool is a human figure. Behind this personal semblance, however, sages discem sornething higher, pictured here as a white sun. Beyond the personal there is the impersonal, manifested as the limitless energy radiated to the planets of innumerable world systems fi'om their sun. I1the process of manifestation, this energy (symbolized also by the fair hair of the traveler) is temporarily limited by living organisms. Of these, the vegetable kingdom, represented by the green wreath, is the primary class from which, in the older of evolution, spling animal organisms, typified by the red feather. The Life-power is forevel young, forevel in the morning of its might, forever on the verge of the abyss of manifestation. It always faces unknown possibilities of self--expression transcending any height it may have leached. Hence the Fool faces toward the Nolth-West. This direction, according to the rituals of occult schools which dramatize the ancient mysteries in their ceremonies, is particularly associated with ilitiation and with the begiruring of new enterprises. He looks toward a peak beyond and above his present situation. He is THAT which was, is and shall be. This is indicated by the Hebrew letters illilr, Yod- Heh-Vav-Fleh shown dirnly among the lines in the folds of the collar of his undergarment. For \"That which was, is and shall be\" is the precise meaning of Yod-Fleh-Vav-Heh. us0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"TAROT- FUNDtIMENTALS. His irurel robe stands for the dazzling white light of perfect wisdom. It is concealed by the black coat of ignorance, lined with the red of passion and of physical force. This outer gannent is embroidered with a floral decoration; but the unit of design is a solar olb containing eight red spokes, and symbolizingthe whirling motion which brings the universe into manifestation. The coat is encircled by a girdle consisting of twelve units of which seven are showing. The girdle symbolizes time, and just as the girdle must be removed before the coat may be taken off, so is it impossible to overcome ignorance and passion until man frees his consciousness fiom the limitations imposed on him by his belief in the reality of time. No single symbol in Tarot is more important than this. What you should notice is that the girdle is artificial, made by man himself, and not a product of nature. This means that man's concept of time is an artificial product, a device of man's creative imagination. It is a most useful invention when rightly employed, but when it is abused, as it is by most persons, it becomes a prolific source of enor. The mountains in the background lepresent those abstract mathematical conceptions which are behind all knorvledge of reality. These conceptions seem cold and uninteresting to many. Yet the melting ice and snow on the peaks feeds the streams which make fertile the valleys below. So will the principles of Ageless Wisdon feed your consciousness and make fertile your mental imagery, thus transforming your whole life. The little dog represents intellect, the reasoning mind which functions at the personal level. In some of the older exoteric versions of Key 0, the dog bites the Fool's leg. When the Tarot Keys were first invented, the inteilectual consciousness of humanity, distorted by centuries of wrorlg thinking, r,vas actively inimical to spiritual truth, and did all it could to impede the progress of the human spirit toward a better knowiedge of reality. In our version the dog is fi'iendly to intimate that even the iower intellect of man has become the companion, rather than the adversary, of those who seek the higher knowledge. Today the human intcllect goes with supelconsciousness on the great spiritual adventure; but it is, nevertheless, at a lor,ver level, and must have superconsciousuess for its master' During yotu'practice period this week, read this lesson once every day.
