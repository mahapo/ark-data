[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Forfv-one RncrNnRarroN The fifth stage of spiritual unfoldment, symbolized by Key 19, is the stage of the new birth from natural humanity into spiritual humanity. Every ceremonial presentation of the process of regeneration employs this symbolism of rebirth. In the natural man, the powers of subconsciousness are stifled and perverted by negative suggestions implanted as a result of enoneous conscious thinking. By applying the correct conscious self-direction to his efforts to grow, a man becomes truly a new-born being, one \"twice-born\". In this new birth the physical body is transformed, and the practical method which effects this change is concisely summarized in the injunction: \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" Meditate on these words. The new birth includes both mental and physical alterations. There is in it a deep inner realization of the true place of man in the cosmic order. Besides this, there is an actual alteration of the physical body. This fifth stage of unfoldment is a degree of adeptship, that of liberation from the limitations of physical matter and circumstance. It is also a grade of conscious identification with the One Life. Yet it is not final. For though it is a stage wherein all material resources are under the control of the adept who, having himself become childlike, experiences the fulfilhnent of the promise: \"A little child shall lead them.\" The person who reaches this grade still feels himself to be separate, or at least, a distinct entity. This is not full liberation, but it is a stage higher than any of those preceding it. It is, in particular, the stage at which all physical forces are dominated by the will of the adept because he is an unobstructed vehicle for the power of the One Will which has ruled these forces ever since the beginning. The number 19 stands for the expression of the power symbolized by 9 through that syrnbolized by I . In Tarot, this is the expression of the force represented by the l.Iermit through the activity represented by the Magician, Remember what you learned from Lessons 21 and 22, namely that the Hermit represents Universal Will, the only free will-power there is, the Will of the One ldentity. The Magician"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS: 4 I represents the plane of personal self-consciousness. Thus in Tarot the number 19 denotes the expression of the One Will through human self-consciousness. The Hebrew letter Resh ('t) means head. With the noun \"head\" we associate the idea of beginning, since what is in the beginning comes first, or takes the lead, and therefbre has precedence, priority and superiority. The head of a government is its ruler, the head of a class is its brightest pupil, and the heads of a speech are the principle points of exposition. Again, we speak of \"head\" in the sense of power, when we say \"a full head of steam\", suggesting concentrated energy. The ideas of completion and accomplishment, moreover, are indicated by phrases like \"to bring to a head\", or \"to come to a head\". The sun is the heavenly body attributed to Resh. This connects the esoteric meaning of the letter with all ideas associated with the sun. ln both Testaments, the Bible calls God the \"sun of life and light\", and in other sacred books, the sun is a principle emblem of Deity. In alchemical writings we read that the Great Work is the Operation of the Sun. The sun is also the symbol fbr alchemical gold, of which Eliphas Levi wrote: \"'l'hc gold of the philosophers is, it-t religion, the absolute and supreme reason, in philosophy it is trr-rth; in visible nature it is the sr\"rn. rvhich is the emblem of the sun of truth, as that itself is the -qhador.v of the First So'.rrce whene.e all splend.ours spring; in the s..rbterranean vrorld it is the putrest and most perfect gold. For this reason the search after the magnum opus is called the search after the Absolute, and the Great Work is itself called the work of the sun.\" The correspondence between the sun and gold is a clue to the whole Hermetic mystery. Thus Sendivogius says the Philosophers' Stone is nothing other than gold digested to the highest degree. Similarly, the anonymous German author of THE GOLDEN TRACT says: \"The reader now knows that the substance of our Stone is neither animal nor vegetable, and that it cloes not belong to the minerals or the base metals, but that it must be extracted fiom gold and silver, and that our gold and silver are not the vulgar, dead gold and silver, but the living gold arrd silver of the Sages.\" This living gold, in its physical manifestation, is the radiant energy of the sun which is truly the First Matter of the Great Work. The alchemists say the First Matter has as many names as there are things on earth, that it swims with the fishes in the sea, and flies with the birds in the air. Compare their doctrine with the following quotation fiom Tyndall's Twelfth Lecture on Heat: \"Every tree, plant, and flower, grows and flourishes by the grace and bounty of the sun. \"As surely as the force which moves a clock's hands is derived from the ann which winds up the clocl<, so surely is all terrestrial power derived from the sun."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TA RO T' F' LI N D A M EN T A L S : ,ll \"Leaving out ofaccount the eruption ofvolcanoes, and the ebb and flow ofthe tides, every manifestation of power, organic and inorganic, vital and physical, is produced by the sun. His warmth keeps the sea liquid, and the atmosphere a gas, and all the storms which agitate both are blown by the mechanical force of the sun. He lifts the rivers and glaciers up to the mountains; and thus the cataract and the avalanche shoot with an energy derived immediately fiorn him. \"Thunder and lightning arc also his transmuted strength. Every fire that burns and every flame that glows dispenses light and heat which originally belonged to the sun, \"In these days, unhappily, tl're news of battle is familiar to us, but every shock and every charge is an application or misapplication, of the mechanical force of the sun.

He forms the muscle; he urges the blood; he builds the brain. His fleetness is in the lion's foot; he soars in the eagle, he glides in the snake. Qrlote here Tyndall's subconscious mind, drawing on its treasure house of inages for the symbols of Leo and Scorpio). \"He builds the forest and hews it down, the power which raised the tree, and which wields the axe, being one and the same. The clover sprouts and blossoms and the scythe of the mower swings by the operation of the same force. Qrlote here another working of the scientist's iutuition, emphasizing that the reproductive power and that which is, for the clover, the scythe ofdeath, are one). \".fhe sun digs the ore from our mines, he rolls the iron, he rivets the plates, he boils the water; he draws the train. He not only grows the cotton, but he spins the fibre and weaves the web. There is not a hammer raised, or a wheel turned. or a shuttle thrown. that is not raised and turned and thrown by the sun. \"l Iis energy is turned freely into space, but our world is a halting place where this energy is conditioned. Here the Proteus works his spells; the self-same essence takes a million hues and shapes, and finally dissolves into its primitive and almost formless form. Tlre sun comes to us as heat; he quits us as heat; and between his entrance and departure, the multifbrm powers of our globe appear. They are all special forms of solar power-the molds into which his strength is temporarily poured in passing from its source through infinitude.\" This quotation is a brilliant exposition of the physical manifestations of the One Radiant Energy. In Tarot, as in alchemy, this All Power is often represented as water, for, as Levi says: \"It is substance and motion at one and the same time; it is a fluid and a perpetual Lts0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AROT FI-]NDAA,IENTALS,. 4] vibration.\" One of the alchemists, speaking of this spiritual radiance as the First Matter or Primal Substance, declares: \"If you call it water, you will not be wrong.\" Down through the ages, the wise men who compose the Inner School have transmitted their knowledge of this living fluidic radiance. Modern science has gone far since Tyndall's day, and now its high priests follow a method diflbring from Ageless Wisdom in just one particular. The modern method is a combination of (1) speculative but logical reasoning basecl on analysis of the elements composing man's environment, and (2) empirical observation of the results of repeated and repeatable experiments. Ageless Wisdom while applauding the so-called scientific method and recognizing the value of its many uses in reaching Truth and Fact, arrives at these twin goals by the short cut of clirect experience. A blind man, for instance, can laboriously leam the intricate and complex theories concerning, say, the electro-magnetic spectrum. He can compare by elaborate mathematical analysis the relationships between, say, the different colors of the visible spectrum. Thus in his own way he can reach his own parlicular apprehension and comprehension of the meaning of, and difference between, red and green. But a seeing child, or sage, dispensing with these laborious procedures of wliich he has no need, directly perceives these colors and the difference between them. This type of direct experience is possible for all but knorvn to relatively few. The spiritual, fluidic, golden water of the alchemists is a reality and may be perceived, as immediately and definitely as any other phenomenon in nature. Hence the Sages aver that they have seen their first matter with their own eyes, and have also touched it with their own hands. Furthermore, they say their First Matter is seen by all, but known by few. lt is then, something within range of our physical senses. Its activities and effects are perceptible by orclinary sensation, but only a few persons know the significance of what is seen by all. Ageless Wisdom is a record of the experience of those who, looking in the right direction, have seen into something which the uninitiated only look at. In the human body, the point of entrance which admits this living radiance into the field of personality is a group of nerve cells fbrming what anatomists call the cardiac ganglion. This ganglion is in the sympathetic nervous system just above and behind the heart, the beat of which it controls. The r-rndifferentiated Life-power enters the body through this center as an electric current enters a bLrilding through the main switch. The nerve-cells of this sun-center charge the blood stream, as it passes through the heart, with this current of radiant energy. Persons having the finer vision which is one of the consequences of occult training are able to see the fine vibrations of this force as they enter our bodies through this cardiac \"main switch\". I 1s0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TAITOT FUNDA14EN tALS: 41 In astrology, the sun rules the sign Leo, which governs the heart, and this confirms the Inner School's attr:ibution of the sun to the cardiac ganglion instead of to the solar plexus. Modern writers who adhere to this latter mistaken attribution do so because they are misled by the anatomists' name for the great nerve center behind the stomach, which in our work, is correctly attributed to Jupiter. In relation to Tarot, this makes I(ey 19 the symbol of the dominant force manifested by the process depicted in Key 8. You will profit by re-reading Lessons 19 and 20 with the thought in mind that they explain the result of the operation of the power symbolized by I(ey 19. Astrologers say also that the sun is exalted, or raised to its highest form of expression, in Aries, corresponding to I(ey 4. Here it will be advisable to review Lessons l1 and 12, thinking of what is pictured by the Emperor as being the highest manifestation of what is syrnbolized by I(ey 19. ln studying l(ey 18, we noted that its number indicates a correspondence between the body- bttilding processes symbolized by that Key and the functions of the Virgo region, typified by I(ey 9. In our study of Key 19 we have to do with the same functions. For what alchemists call their \"Stone\" is termed also their \"Medicine\". (In this connection, review the explanations of the word \"Stone\", given in Lessons 8 and 14). Consider now the separate letters of the noun f !N \"ehben\", Stone. The first is Aleph, symbol of the Life-Breath, typified by Key 0. The second is Beth, representing self-consciousness and Mercury, symbolizedby the Magician. The third is Nun, conesponding to Scorpio, and to I(ey 13. Add together the numbers of I(eys 0, 1 , and 13, and the total is 14, the number of Temperance, which symbolizes the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Wren we establish communication with the Higher Self, we enter into a state of conscious recognition of the truth that the Father (lN) and the Son (f !) are truly in perfect union. We enter into this consciousness through an influx of the All-Power (I(ey 0) into the field of self- consciousness (I(ey I ), whence it is directed to subconscious levels so as to modify the operation of the setpent power, or Scorpio force. Thus the Magician cultivates flowers in his garden, fbr flowers are the reproductive organs of the vegetable kingdom. As a result of exercises used by practical occultists, the force which analytical psychology terms \"libido\" is raised or sublimated so that it awakens brain centers which bring us into the higher order of knowing. I{ere the Father M and the Son ll instead of being regarded as being separate, are seen to be in perfect union. This conscious realization is not only the \"Stone\", but also the \"Medicine\", for it heals all diseases of mind and body. Sometimes it is called the Medicine of the Metals. because the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T'AllO7' FUN DAMENT'ALS: 4 I alchemical metals are the seven interior stars pictured by l(ey 17, and these are made whole, and their powers are equilibrated in the state of consciousness indicated by the inner significance of l5N, \"ehben\", the STONE. The result is a physiological, as well as a psychological, transformation. The adept's body chemistry is changed. 'fhe subtle structure of the cells composing his organism is changed. -I'hus he becomes newly born, or regenerated. As you color i(ey 19, fix its details in mind so that you will the more easily follow the explanations in the next lesson. I(eep up the practice of reviewing the day's activities; but this week endeavor to intensify your realization that the entire physical aspect of these activities is, as the long quotation fiom fyndall shows, really a series of transformations of solar radiance into zrll the multiform events and things of your daily experience.
