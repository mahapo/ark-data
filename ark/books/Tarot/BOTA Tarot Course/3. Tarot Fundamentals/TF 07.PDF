Remernber, Talot uses the universal language of pictorial symbolism with which the deeper part of your mind is perfectly familiar. One purpose of the Tarot Keys is to evoke thought, and by looking at a Key before yotr begin to read oul explanations, you bring closer to the surface the knowledge already present in tire depths of your subconsciousness. This will make it easier for you to grasp the significance of the written words. Devote at least five minutes to this preparatory practice. Longer whenevet you have time. Among the meanings of the number is subordination. This wold gives a clue to the relationship existing between s'rbconsciousness, represented by I(ey 2, and objective mind, or self-consciousness, r'epresented by the Magiciarr. The syrnbolisrn of Key 1 shows the Magician controlling the powers of subconsciousness which ale always amenable to his suggestive influence. It is because of this that you ale able to ernploy these Keys to bring into vigorous manifestation the latent folces of your inner life. The principle involved has been explained in Lesson 3 of SEVEN STEPS. Review that lesson. and Lesson 2 of the sane course. iu counection with your pr:esent study. The psychological law there stated, that subconsciousness is perfectly amenable to control by suggestion, makes it obvious that what you must consider very carefully is how you use your self-conscious mind. For it detetmines what you plant in subconsciousness. Subconsciousness, you will recall, is represented by the garden in I(ey 1. The fertile soil of this garden will grow any seed planted by the Magician. if he plants careless qbservatiass and incorect lgasoning, the weeds of conscious thou_ght, subconsciousness will devel.op these seeds of error a thousandfold, with all sofis of uncomfoltable consequences. On the other hand, if you learn to co4_centrate, to rnake your mental imagely.clear and definite, if you make accurate obselvations fi'om which you draw coLrect inferences. the seed you plant iu yout- subconscious garden will bear fi'uit in the renewal, revivification and regeneration of your' pelsonality.

If you arc not certain as to the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning, consult a dictionary before ploceeding farther'. Always, when you study, have a good dictionary at hand, for you will need it often in the course of this instruction. You will find that the practice of making sure of the precise meaning and use of words will be of inestimable benellt to you in the orderly organization of your mental processes. Geometrically, the number 2 is the line, the extension of the point (number l). This is related to the subconsciotts power jnst mentioned whereby the consequences of conscious tliought and observation are developed. Note that the extension of the central point of a circle into a diameter (an extension in two opposite directions) divides the circle into two parls, each the exact duplicate of the other. In this power of duplication may be perceived the basic fr-rnction of subconsciousness, mernory. This brings us to a third psychological principle: Subconsciollsness keeps a perfect record of ail experience and therefble has perfect memory. Not only does it retain every experience of a single person, but it holds also a summary of tire race experience, and this is one of the sources of our intuitions and of our scientific discovelies. When Hebrew letters were scratched nrdely on stone. the character fol t. Gimel- the letter plinted otr l(ey 2, was a picture of a borv. This is one reason Gimel follorvs Beth in the alphabet. The primitive character for Beth was an an-ow-head, and, in the development of weapons, bo'r.vs follow affows. Men began by thro'\"ving their darts by hand. The invention of the bor,v came later. A bow speeds an arrow to its malk, yet it is secondary when it is considered as a weapon suggested by the dart or arrow. A bow, lnoreover, extends the range of an arrow. So the subconsciousness represented by Girnel carries yolr conscious detelminations to successftil conclusions. It makes your decisions \"hit the mark\". Yet the activities of subconsciousness ale derived fi'om, and are secondaly to, the operations of self-consciousness which are pictured by I(ey 1. Subconsciollsness is the propulsive, driving force in human personality. Keep in mind tlds idea of propulsion. Link it up with the noun plopeller, that which drives a boat ol an airplane. Self-consciousness aims and steers. The motive force is provided by subconsciousness. As a syrnbol the bow is ferninine and the characteristics of subconsciousness are those which, fiom tirne immemorial, have been associated with the t-eminine sex. Subconsciousness is the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAA4ENTILS: protective, maternal, nutritive, reproductive aspect of consciousness, always represented in esoteric litelatue under the guise of feminine symbols. Arnong these, besides the bow, are the ark, the crescent moon, the cup, the sirip, the sistrum of Isis, almonds, ovals, lozenges (diamond-shaped figures), and many others, including some we shall find in the series of Tarot i(eys. The letter-name, Gimel, means \"camel\". The early fonns of the letter may have suggested the name because the head and neck of a camel bear sorne resemblance to a bent bow. Again, the Hebrew verb gawmel, spelt witli the same letters (inl; as tl-re noun Gimel, means: 1. to carty aload; 2. to t'ipen, as fruits; 3. to recoinpense, whether fol good or for evil, so that it includes the ideas of reward and of punishment. AII these meanings are connected with the action of subconsciousness. One farniliar activity of subconsciousness is \"mind-wandering\". This enables us, when we fall into a state of reverie, to pass from one thought to another until we have traversed a vast field of ideas. Until we leam to control this powel of associating irnage with image, it interferes with concentration and with all other directed use of our mental powers. It is like a camel running wild. Wien we leam to drive it, this same power of association will take us quickly to any chosen goal. As the seat of memory, subconsciousness \"calTies the load\" of our personal experience. It bears a greater burden than this, because subconsciousness is a universal phase ofthe Life- power's activity, and \"personal\" subconsciousness is rnerely a particular manifestation, tluough a single organism, of this great and all-inclusive universal subconsciousness. Flence, when we learn how, we may gain access to the recolds of all experience by tapping the cosmic subconscious memolies. By this means it is possible to arrive at accurate reconstructions of the past. Sometimes only the general principles are recovered, and the discovelies of scientists are often simply this, as more than one of them has admitted. Occasionally tire particular dctails of sorne ancient era are also recoveled, and occuit literature contains many authentic examples of this type of recovery. Other implications of the letter-name Gimel are transportation; rnotion from place to place; m.oventent to and fi'o, as of tlie regular joumeys of caravans over trade routes. Hence, commerce, change, r'eciprocity, interchange, alternation, correlation, correspondence and communication, dissemination of infbrmation, consequently, education and science. Study all these words with the aid of a dictionary. They describe your subconsciousness and its powers. in the esoteric doctrine of Israel, Girnel is said to correspond to the Moon which is a \"ship of the skies\", just as a camel is a \"ship of the desefi\". The Moon center in the human brain is the pituitary body, which, besides the function known to physiologists, is understood by occultists to act as a transrnitting station thlough which the mental states of self-consciousness are relayed to centers of the nervous system located in tire physical body below the brain. us0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7'A ROT I; U N D A A,T ENTA LS. Among the icleas suggested by the Moon are: reflection; periodicity (because it waxes and wanes); association, accolrpaniment, correlation (because the Moon is a satellite, consort or follower of the earth, and in like manner subconsciousness follows the lead of self- consciousness). As a crescent, the Moon suggests a bow, the original form of Gimel. Thus it is connected with the goddess named Diana by the Romans and Artemis by the Greeks. Diana is a huntress, and to hunt is to follow, to inquire, to pursue. Even while we sleep subconsciousness is reviewing all or-rr experiences, mrninating (like a camel chewing its cud) over what we have sensed, felt and leasoned. During sleep this nocturnal mcntal luminary carries on the mental processes which lead to the consequences of r,vhat we have observed, fblt and conscior\"rsiy leasoned out during the day. Diana or Arternis was a virgin godcless, and because she presided over child-bifth she was closely related to Hecate, who, for the ancient Greeks, combined the characteristics of moon goddess, earth goddess, and queen of the under-world of shades, the abode of the dead. Hecate had a share in the rulership of earth and sea; gave aid in war, in athletic contests and in hunting, plotected herds and children; but she was particularly the goddess of magic, mystery aud occult powers generall5z. She also presided over the rneeting place at which roads oross. Indeed, it is principally fi'om the attlibutes of Hecate tl-rat the symbolism of the second Tarot I(ey is derived. All the Powers attributed to these moon goddesses are actual, living powers of your subconsciousness. One key word for tl-ris picture, based on its connection rvith Girnel ancl the Moon, is association. Not only ordinary association of ideas within tire limits of youl personal mind. but a r'vider kind of association, symbolized by the camel because the journeys of caravans connect distant places. Subconsciousness has perfect connection with all points in space. This law is the basis of the phenomenon of telepathy. It is also the law which will put you in touch with your own personal Teacher when you have developed to a point where you are leady for higher instruction. This same law has many other applications in practical occultism. During your practice period this week, aftel coloring I{ey 2 in accordance with the dilections given at the end of the lesson, try to get the \"feel\" of the powers of your subconsciousness. Try to rcalize that everything you thinl< aid feei, as it is recolded on your own scloll, is also inflttencing the universal substance within which yon live and move and have youl being. There is not a single thought or emotion which is completely private. If you feel rnisunderstood, yottl faraily, fi'iends and br-rsiness associates will be influenced by this subtle emanating substance and respond in like lneasule. If instead, you use the Magician to focus your attention on attempts to understand others, with feelings of good-will, subconsciousness will transforrl yotr relationships.
