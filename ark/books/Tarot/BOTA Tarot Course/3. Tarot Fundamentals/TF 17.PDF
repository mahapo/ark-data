[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Seventeen RECEPTIvITy-Wu.I Review the meanings of 7 in Lesson 2 before reading this lesson. In Hebrew, which has greatly influenced the philosophy of Tarot, the idea \"seven\" is expressed by a noun spelt with the same letters as a verb meaning \"to be full, filled, satisfied\". Another noun denoting \"abundance, plenty\", is spelt the same r,vay. So is an adjective translated \"satiated, full, satisfied\". F-inally, these same letters form a verb meaning \"to swear, to vow, to confirm by oath, to express solemn intention\". Among the meanings of 7 you find mastery, conquest, peace, safety, security. All these are related to the root-meaning of the verb which signifies \"to be filled, satisfied\". We associate peace and safety with abundance and plenty. Conquest, another meaning of 7, is the result of carrying definite purpose into action. Peace follows conquest, and conquest itself leads to the establishment of equilibrium between contending forces. As an ancient occult ritual says: \"Two contending forces, and one reconciler between them.\" Hence we may expect to find that the Tarot Key numbered 7 symbolizes a power which can establish harmony, can bring order out of chaos. It is a power of adaptation and adjustment. This power is WILL; but the occult concept of Will is different from ordinary notions because occultists regard Will as being in no sense a personal faculty. Will is not something strong- minded people possess while the timid are devoid of it. Will is the living, motivating power behind the entire universe. Every person and thing in creation has an equal share in it. Remember the words of the Pattern; \"A11 the power that ever was or will be is here, now.\" The difference between persons is not in the degree of Will-power as a possession. We all have access to an unlimited supply. That wherein we differ is in the degree of our ability to express this power through our personalities. Will-power is a cosmic energy, not a personal force. So long as men suffer from the delusion that they possess wills of their own, they remain in bondage.

One might as well claim to own the air he breathes. In all tlie universe there is only one Will-power. It is the power expressed through all the various laws of life. Through want of right discrimination a man may suppose himself to have something he calls \"will\". He may go so far in his delusion as to suppose he can pit that imaginary \"will\" of his against the laws of being. He who can discriminate is not so deluded. Hence, in Tarot, the l(ey picturing the true Will-power, and man's relation to it, follows the I(ey which represents discrimination. If one sees what Key 6 shows, that the power-source behind and above man's self'-consciousness and subconsciousness (the two aspects of personal life) is a superconscious reality superior to every personal limitation, then it is a logical consequence to see that Will-power must be super-personal, So much for reasoning. If we tum to the report of those men whom history designates as masters of life, what do they say? Invariably they whose achievements express the superlative degree of mastery are persons who most emphatically deny that they have any will of their own. Moses was one such. So was Buddha. So was Jesus, who said\" \"I have no will save to do the will of Him that sent me.\" -fhe counsel of these masters of life to those who seeh to follow in their footsteps is ever the saiiie : \"Above all elsc, .itl yuerrscif uf iiie cieiLisiul t-rf scif-wiii. Lcarn io be reoeplive i\"o tlte inner guidance of the only Will-power there is. Obey the true Will which is above you and behind you. Remember always that the true Will is never your own.\" 'fhe meaning of the letter Cheth printed on Key 7, is field or fence. Both meanings imply inclosure. Primarily, the field intended is the universe, including all manifested objects and energies. In man, the field is the personality, and the master or cultivator of this field is the true I AM, or Inner Self. The idea of a field brings out the fact that personality may be cultivated. That is, the potencies of Will-power may be brought into active manifestation through the functions of a personal vehicle which has been properly prepared. Will-power may be likened to the seed from which all possibilities are developed. [t is also the fruition of those possibilities when they have been brought from latency into active manifestation. Give this idea earnest and attentive consideration. It will shed a flood of light on the true function and purpose of personality. You will begin to understand the true value of personality as an instrument whereby you may make progress."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROT F-UNDAMENTALS: ]7 Personality must be regarded ahvays as an instrument. lt must never be mistaken for the worlcman who employs it. It is always the field, not the cultivator. You are not your body. You are not your emotions. You are not your mind. If you were, you could not apply the possessive case to them. You do not possess what you are. Hence the letter Cheth is said to stand for a mode of consciousness named \"The Intelligence of the House of Influence.\" The noun translated \"influence\" means also \"wealth. abundance\". The purport of this is that the master-consciousness, the mental state which permits the greatest possible expression of Will-power and the highest degree of control of circumstances is one which grasps the truth that human personality is the abode or dwelling of a power which flows into the conscious and subconscious levels of personality from a plane above those levels. This descendiug influence is the only true Will-power. lt is free from every restriction whatever. the only free Will there is. A field is a definite idea linked to a form which makes it intelligible. A word endows an idea with specific, concrete meaning. There are mere noises having no true meaning, and not a few of our troubles may be traced to our want of ability to distinguish these meaningless noises from genuine words. All true and definite words are words of power. lt is to such that the wise referred when they assigned the function of speech to the letter Cheth. By speech, they meant not oniy what is uttered audibly, but had in mind also the silent language of thought. Our habits of speech reveal the degree of Will development. Words we use continually, every day, and the meanings we attach to them, are the patterns of our life-expression. This does not mean that persons who use big words, or unusual ones, express life more completely than do those whose speech is simple and homely. Quite the contrary; but accuracy in the use of words, care in selecting them, so that they express true meanings, choice of positive, strong, courageous words-these are among the most important requirements for unfoldment of Will- power. Such words result in correspondingly positive mental, emotional and physical states. Their opposites result in confused thinking, chaotic feelings, physical disease, and disorderly environment. Certain words have specific vibratory power when spoken or sung. Among such are the mystic syllable Om, various divine and angelic names in many tongues, together with certain artificial sound combinations. The use of such special words is a difficult art. Hindus call it Mantra Yoga. us0300"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T'AIIOT T.'UN DAMENTAL,S.. ] 7 One should not experiment with such word forms unless one knows just what he is doing. The early stages of this work clemand the supervision of a competent personal teacher. Of the powcr of sound, Madame Blavatsky says, in THE SECRET DOCTRINE, that it is a \"tremendous fbrce, of which the electricity generated by a million Niagaras could never oounteract the smallest potentiality, when directed by occult knowledge.\" Not exactly aplay- thing fbr the idly curious who merely \"want to see what will happen!\" Cancer, the Crab, is the zodiacal sign attributed to the letter Cheth as fence, and to the meaning of 7 as denoting safety and security. Astrology says Cancer rules the chest, the fence of bones which protects the most important vital organs, and this also agrees with the basic meaning of the letter. Cancer is ruled by the moon and the planet Jupiter is exalted therein. Our habitual subconscious mental states (the moon, Key 2) have rulership over our expression of Will- power. The fact that the power of Will always expresses itself in some kind of cyclic activity has to do with the connection between the planet Jupiter and Key 7, as you will understand better after you have studied I(ey 10. The title,'Ihe Chariot, slrms up all we have been considering. A chariot is a movable fence, a protection for its rider. The Key-word to an understanding of this title is \"vehicle.\" Buddha used to liken personality to a chariot. So did Pythagoras. In THE BHAGAVAD-GITA we read: \"The Sclf is the rider in the chariot of tlie bodv. of w-liicli the senses are thc horses\" and the mind the reins.\" This is what is meant by \"Intelligence of the House of Influence.\" Right discrimination shows that personality has no power of its own. Personality is a vehicle of power, an instrument through which power is made rnanifest. The place of personality in the cosmic order is that of an intermediate agency through which the one Will-power, itself the energy of superconsciousness, is brought to bear upon the states and conditions which constitute man's environment. To see this and to shape thought, word and action to agree with such right discrimination as to the true significance of personality, is to adopt the method which will insure the highest possible development of Will-power. This week, as you look at I{ey 7 and color it, bring again and again to rnind the thought that your personality is an instrument or vehicle for the expression of the same limitless Will- power which manifests itself throughout the universe as the power which marks out specific lields of concrete expression for the One Life. Remember thatT is the number related to the idea expressed by the verb \"to vow\". Dedicate yourself to an ever-increasing msasure of leceptirzity to the influence pouring into your field of personal consciousness from the supercollscious plane above. Frame this vow of dedication in a sentence which expresses the idea briefly and clearly. Watch your habits of speech and thought so that you may make them harmonize with your vow of dedication.
