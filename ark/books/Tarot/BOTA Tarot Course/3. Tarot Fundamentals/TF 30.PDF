[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Thirty DEATI.I On the sutface, the skeleton of l(ey 13 is a conventional representation of the \"Grim Reaper\". 'fo the eye of the initiated it conveys a reminder that the bony structure of the body is the fcrundation of its every motion. Because our muscles are attached to our bones we can walk, move our hands and feet, and so on. Even the involuntary muscles are connected with the skeleton, and could not move otherwise. Thus what is shown here is really the basis of all our bodily activities. Symbolically, therefore, it stands for that which is the basis of all function and of all growth and development. This something is the One Power, specialized in the reproductive functions of the body. lt is the seed power, and it is to this that the conventionahzed picture of a seed, in the upper leIl- hand corner of the I(ey, ref-ers. This little seed is composed of tr,vo ovals, that is, of two zeroes. l''rom the smaller oval tive rays extend toward the limits of the larger one. The two ovals are joined so that they are really one. Here is a simple hieroglyphic for the process of manif'estation. 'fhe inner and smaller oval is the source of radiant energy differentiated as ether, fire, water, air and earth. (In later lessons you will learn more about the inner meanings of these elements.) This energy fills the space enclosed by the larger oval which is one with the smaller oval. 'l'his expresses a fundamental doctrine of Ageless Wisdom: The Inner Power projects itself, or a seeming extension of itself, as a space (the large I i oval) and fills that space with forms of energy whose combination constitutes the body of , I the universe. i F- Copy this r.rnderlined statement into your notebook. Read it several times, and if you can, add to it some thouglrts of your own. ln due course, you will come to understand that it is a concise and accurate statement of the way the universe comes into being. (\"Comes\" is used in the present tense because Ageless Wisdom has always taught that creation is a continuing and everlasting process. While modern scientists have as yet not accepted the f-act of continuing and spontaneous creation of matter and energy in the inter- stellar spaces, interesting theories on this subject have recently been advanced by eminent physicists.

'l-he figure is twisted at two points, one just above the pelvis, the other at the neck. 'fhis would be obvious were the skeleton covered with flesh. It would be a posture no contortionist could imitate, The fbrce here symbolized must be twisted, or reversed, in order to perfbrm its highest function. The skeleton walks from north to south, from the darkness of ignorance to the light of perf-cction. It represents the fiamework of all progress-the disintegration of form for the sake of releasing energy and the growth of new fbrrns. .l'he handle of the scythe is shaped like a letter'f. Thus it has the same meaning as the gallows of the Flanged Man, fol'I'and Tav are two forms of the same letter. 'fhus the handle of tlrc scythe is connected with ideas Tarot symbolizes by Key 2l,the World. The blade of the scythe is shaped like a crescent suggesting the moon and referring to sttbcotrscious powers symbolized by l(ey 2. Yetthe material of the blade is steel, a metal attributed to Mars. 'Ihe red background of Key 13 is another reference to Mars. 'Ihe river flows toward the sun. It starts in the north and makes a bend so that it also florvs eastward. 'fhe bend in the river has the same significance as the twist in the skeleton's spine. Il ili.imates a cirange of direction in the cunent oienergy. Remember tirat this is the river which begirts in the robe of the i'ligh Priestess, and makes a r,vaterfall in the Empr-ess' garden. Tlace it through the other'farot Keys. The sun is another important detail, Tire idea of death as the end of personal existence is ttsually associated with west and with sunset. In this l(ey, however, the sun is rising. This intitnates that the power men call death is really the power of life. Every dissolution of- fbrm brings about the birth of new ones. The rising sun is connected with the letter Daleth and with the symbolism of the Empress. A littlc rneditation on this relationship will deepen your understanding of Key i2 which prccecles l(ey 13. Note that the digits of l2 adcl to 3. The rising sun refers to the clawn of the highcr <;onsciousness in the state of Samadhi symbolized by the l{anged Man. This dawn of a new knowing is what is behind the transfbrmation shown by Key 13. 'fhe rvhite rose refers to the planet Uranus and has the same meanings as the rose in the left hand o1'the Fool. Review what is written concerning it in Lesson 4. Remember also that the rose is related to the number 5 and review what is said of this in Lesson 6. The key thought is that mastery of the subtle forms of the Mars force is a work of adaptation, symbolized by the number 5, and by the five-pointed star or pentagram which is explained in Lesson 13."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAROI' FllNDAMENTALS: 30 The woman's head at the left of the picture is a symbol of understanding for reasons which will be evident to you when you take up the study of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. In the Qabalah, the Sephirah named Understanding is usually called the Mother, but we are told that in the perfection of the Great Work, the Queen and the Mother are made one. 'l'he man's hcad represents Wisdom, and also Beauty, fbr it is the Qabalistic symbol of that which, as Father, is termed Wisdom, and, as Son, is called Beauty. Yet remember that the Father and the Son are in perfect union and that unity is intimated here. Three hands are shown. 'fwo are active, springing up from the earth. The third is passive, restiug palm downward on the surface of the ground. The active hands represent the new works which result from the transfbrmation indicated by Key 13. The passive hand is a reference to Yod, the Great lJand, of which we become aware in the higher order of knowing. Only one fbot is shown because this picture refers to the end of the Piscean Age and the zocliacal sign Pisces rules the feet. That is to say, we are in the latter end of the Piscean Dispensation. fhese details of tlie three hands and the one foot are in strict conformity to the esoteric Tarot whicll has never been published. They are also in agreement with the early exoteric Tarot shown in Court de Gebelin's MONDE PzuMITIF, and reproduced in Papus'TAROT OF THE IIOI{EMIANS, and in THE KliY OF I)ESTiNY, by f)r. and Mrs. Cltrti-ss. For good reasons, much has been left to your intuition with respect to this Key. Lessons likc these are not a proper medium fbr practical instruction in the reversal of the currents of the Mars force. Yet we believe enough has been said to pr.rt you on the track of principles. If you follow this lesson thlough, with l(ey l3 before you, many valuable intimations should present themselves to you, especially in rneditation. In the language of pictorial symbolism, understood perfectly by your suboonscious mind trecause it is the one truly universal language transcending the limitations of human speech, Key 13 tells the secret of secrets and passes on to you our inheritance from the wise men who have gone this way before us. It is a secret w'hich kills out the old mistaken conceptions of the place of personality in the schcme of things. It is a secret which truly makes one fi'ee from the \"last enemy\" by giving us direct perception of life eternal. As you progress in the path of practical occultism, this will become to you more and more an open secret. As you begin to understand it, you will understand also the reasons for the careful reserve concerning it which is characteristic of all truly wise instruction, both ancient and modern."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T.4 RO'r l;UND,'tAl]iNT'ti 1,,\\ 30 He rvho knows this secret has in his hands a power which might be used to overturn the worlcl. Yet no person leams it until he is truly prepared, and, more than anything else, this lneans such ethical preparation that no temptation to misuse this power could ever be sufficient to turn the knower from the path of strictly constructive and beneficent application of the force he is able to control.

To rnan's ft\"ame, as there come infancy and youth and age, so come there raisings-up ancl laying down of other and of other lif-e-abodes, which the wise know, and fear not.\" THE MEANING OF L. V. X. Frequentiy in the course of your lessons and correspondence, 1,ou will come upon the word \"1,.V.X.\" 'fhis is intended as a brief explanation of its meaning. L. V. X. stands prirnarily for Lux the Latin noun for Light. In the Western School of occultism this word is often written with capital letters separated by perinds to call attention to the valttes of the letters in the Roman system of numeration. L indicates 50, V stands for 5, and X is 10. Thus the total value of the word is 65. This number represents the operation of the power symbolized by 5 as that power is expressed through the agency symbolized by 6. In occultism, therefbre, 65 sums up the Great Work, since it is the numerical sign of the manifestation of the power of the pentagram (5) through the agency ofthe hexagram (6). ln practical occultism, the pentagram, or five-pointed star, is the sign of the Christos, the spiritual fbrce of the I AM seated in the hearts of men; and the hexagram, or six-pointed star, is a symbol of the cosmic forces surrounding man and constituting his environment. The perrtagram is the sign of the mind's clomination of the forces of nature. The hexagram represents the cosmic forces and laws which rnake up the whole field of activity revolving round the central I AM. Thus thc nurnber 65 expresses the occult truth that the Christos (5) at the center of the temple of human personality is actually in control over all natural fbrces (6). The indwelling Self is ruler of the cosmic order. I{ence we find that tl-re number 65 is the value of the Hebrew noun 'tJ'tN Aclonai, \"Lord\" (literally \"my Lord\"), a Divine Name which refers particularly to the One Lif-e-power as ruler of the universe. 1t,10300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T'AROT FLlNDAMENTILS,. 3O fhe same number 65 is also the sum of the values of the letters in the noun !:tn, Haikal, mcaning \"temple\" or \"palace.\" In'IIIE BOOK OF FORMATION we are told that this \"Palace of Holiness\" is located \"in the midst\", or \"in the center\". In the Biblical ternple syrnbolism, of which F'reemasonry has preserved some fragments, the midst is called the sanctum s:rnctorum or Floly of lJolies. This room had the dimensions of a perl'ect cube, and is related to the whole series of symbolic ideas expressed by thc cube which is shown on the seal of the B.O.T.A. In Solomon's Ternple, the Holy of Flolies contained the Ark of the Clovenant and the mercy-seat on which rested the Shekinah or Radiant Presence of God. In i{osicrucian tradition, L. V. X. is comected with the mystery of the cross, because the letters of the word may be formed from three equal-armed crosses. In the rituals of certain societies conforming to old Rosicrucian traditions, three signs or tokens are given to represent the three letters of this woLd, and with these signs is uttered the phrase: \"L. V, X., the Light of tite Cross.\" Because our more esoteric work has a link of connection with these traditions, we use the conclusion, f'Your Brother (or Sister) in L. V. X.\" or sometimes simply, \"In L. V. X.\" at the end of all our letters.
