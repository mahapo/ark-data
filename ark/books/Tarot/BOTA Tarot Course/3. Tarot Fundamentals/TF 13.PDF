[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Thirteen IilrurrroN By this time you will have become used to a definite method for studying these lessons which you will follow through the entire series. For every Key there are two lessons. In the first of these, the meanings of the number, title and letter are dealt with, the emphasis being on the general meaning of the l(ey. During the week that you study that lesson you also color the I(ey to fix its details in memory and prepare you fbr the longer analysis of the symbolism given in the second of the pair of lessons. Every day begin your study period by meditating five minutes on the Tarot Key. Then study the lesson, reflect on it as you read, and write in your diary whatever observations occur to you. This week your Key is number 5, the Hierophant. After inspecting it for five minutes, review the meanings of the number 5 given in Lesson 2. Note that 5 symbolizes the results of the classifying activity represented by the nunber 4. A sr-rbconscious elaboration of these classifications, and the formation of deductions therefrom, which are projected back into the self-conscious level, results in the mental states termed intuitions. Even the form of the hgure 5 suggests this. The top is a right angle composed of straight lines. The bottom is a swelling curve. T'he straight lines are masculine and relate to self-consciousness. The curve is feminine, syrnbolizing subconsciousness. A cyclic mental process gives rise to intuitions. Every idea projected intuitively from subconsciousness into self-consciousness becomes another suggestion to subconsciousness and is the beginning of yet another series of deductions. 'fhe working out of this process may be instantaneous. This is what occurs when we \"think quickly\". On the other hand, it may be a matter of days, or longer. A common example of this, one which you have probably experienced many times, is what occurs when one reads some difficult passage, At first it may seem to be obscure. Yet the next time one sees it, the meaning is perfectly clear even though no conscious thought may have been given it in the interval.

As here treated, intuition is understood to be direct perception of eternal principles which may be applied to the solution of human prnblems and to the perfecting of human control over man's cnvironment. Tbis direct perception is the result of the union of personal consciousness with the superconscious I AM, the Central Self, which a poet has called \"the blaze of God\". Such perception makes a human being immediately aware of eternal principles, but it does not stop there. Included in this awareness is also a perception of methods whereby the principles may be applied to the solution of'particular problems. Intuitions of this kind differ greatly fi'om those whose roots go no deeper than the \"upper layer\" of subconsciousness, which is rnerely a record of personal experience. The deeper strata of subconsciousness record the race experience and correspond to what Carl Jung names \"the collective unconscious.\" Intuitions coming from the upper, personal level of subconsciousness are what we commonly call \"hunches\". Intuitions originating in superconsciousness clothe themselves in the symbolic imagery of the race experience, stored in the collective subconsciousness. These may be correctly termed spiritual intuitions. The word union is the key to the reception of spiritual intuitions. Unless there be a real union between the personality and the Central Self, there never can be an expression of superconsciousness, and one does not touch the high plane where eternal principles are perceived. I(ey 5 syrnbolizes this idea of union in many ways. The I-Iebrew letter Vav (l) means \"nail\" or \"hook\". Both meanings represent union since nails are used to join various parts of a house and a hook.joins the obiect fastened to it to the support to which the hook is attached. Notice that the idea of sustenance is also connected with the nail or hook since it is by nails that the house is sustained and a hook is that from which something depends. Wren the Cenlral Self is linked consciously with the personality, one gains first-hand knowledge that all things are sustained by, and depend on, that ONE SELF. The idea of union is carried out still f'urther by the primitive form of the letter Vav. This was a picture of a yoke such as is used to harness oxen. Remember that the letter Aleph means \"ox\" and you will see that here is a hint as to the means for \"harnessing\" the limitless energy of the Life-power. Think this over and record the results of your thinking in your occult diary. The root of the English noun yoke is the Sanskrit yoga, of which the exact translation is \"union\". As commonly taught, yoga is a system of practices designed to bring about the us0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TAllOT' t'-UNDIMENTALS: I 3 union of the higher and lower natures of man. The religious doctrine of atonement (at-one- ment) is another expression of the same idea. The practical application of the conception of union is to be found in the function of hearing which is attributed to 't and thus to I(ey 5. As employed here, \"hearing\" means interior, spiritual audition, as well as ordinary physical hearing. Knowledge of the higher aspects of reality often comes to us through the \"soundless sound\" of an Inner voice. The reason for this is that the hearing centers in the brain, when they reach a certain stage of finer development, are stimulated by higher rates of vibration which serve as a means of communication with the Central Self. The same receptivity of the hearing centers also puts us in communication with those advanced human beings who compose the membership of the Inner School. I{ere a word of warning is necessary. The awakening of the greater receptivity of the hearing centers may put us in comtnunication with intelligences which are neither wise nor good. Do not let this fiighten you. There is a way to distinguish between these \"voices\" and the VOICE. Ollen the voices flatter. 'lihey promise great things-wealth, power, knowledge, prominence, and so on. Sometimes they appeal to spiritual pride by announcing that the person who hears them is destined to save humanity from some dire catastrophe. Always they dernand impticit obedience. If they give what purports to be occult instruction, they require its recipients to follow the teaching without criticism, and often they insist that all other instruction be abandoned. 'fhe true VOICE never flatters. Often it gently, but firmly, points out our shortcomings. Seldom does it promise anything. Never does it coerce. Invariably it indicates some universal and therefore eternal principle which applies to an actual problem confronting the person who hears the instruction. The VOICE does not say, \"Do thus and so.\" It instructs us concerning some law of nature which is involved in our problem so that we may see for ourselves what we ousht to do. I-Ience this mode of consciousness associated with Vav and Key 5 is called \"The 'Iriumphant and Eternal Intelligence\" because the Inner Voice, by indicating a principle which will work out in a successful course of action, reveals a law of nature which applies not only to our personal problem of the moment, but also to many others having similar characteristics. 'fhrougliout the ages, wise men have taught and practiced union with the Central Self. Everywhere aud always they have agreed that release from every kind of limitation comes to those who awaken recognition of this power which is always present in human life. This power sets men free when they know it and act in obedience to its law.

The pentagram is one of the most important occult symbols. Each of its five lines is divided in exact extreme and mean proportion (the famous Golden Section or Divine Proportion). With a single point uppermost, it suggests the head and four extremities of the human body. On this aocount it is a symbol of man and especially of man as the microcosm. Again, 5 is the number of mediation because it is the middle term between I and 9. So is man, whose number is 5, the mediator between God and nature. Flere is a clue to many mysteries of Tarot and of practical occultism. The sign Taurus, the Bull, is attributed to Vav and Key 5. Taurus is an earthy sign, yet the symbol of the bull is closely related to that of the ox, represented by the letter Aleph. Aleph, you have learned, is a symbol for the Life Breath, Spirit, slrperconsciousness. Yet here is a symbol which is practically the same, attributed to the element of earth, which stands for the physical plane. What seems at first to be a conffadiction is really a clear intimation that the spiritual and the material are essentially the same. The Divine Force which is health to the soul, medicine to the body, and the source of all true wealth, is omnipresent. The average person, i1'he recognizes this Divine Force at all, thinks of it as being far away. Such a person makes a sharp distinction between Spirit and Matter, but the wise know better. Thcy r,r'ho have achieved union with the One Self perceive that in reality there is no such separation. For Knowers of Reality, the substance of anything whatever is the actual presence of the One Spirit. Taurus is ruled by Venus and is the sign wherein the moon is exalted. Intuitions are the progeny of the Empress (Venus), and this Empress is the High Priestess (Moon) in her highest expression of active creation. Thus we learn that superconsciousness is to be reached through the functions of subconsciousness . In the older exoteric Tarot, I(ey 5 was named The Pope. This refers to the attribution of the function of hearing to this I(ey. For tradition has it that the first pope was the Apostle Simon, nicknamed \"Peter\", the \"Rock\". Simon (in Hebrew, Simeon) means \"hearing\". Read the passage in St. Matthew 16: 13-19, which is the basis of the papal tradition. There you will find a clear intimation that Simon's al1swer, for which Jesus blessed him, was the result of interior hearing. I{ierophant, the esoteric title of Key 5, means \"revealer of mysteries\", or, \"he who shows that which is sacred\". In the Eleusinian Mystelies, the hierophant was the teacher who explained the meanings of the sacred symbols.

When this occurs, you have not only a true understanding of the meaning of life and its expression, but you are also enabled to employ all your powers to the best advantage. Finally, I(ey 5 follows the Emperor, who represents Reason, in order to show: (1) that he who would be instructed by the Inner Voice must first have trained his mental vision so as to see his situation clearly, even though that situation presents a problem; (2) thatthough intuition goes beyond reason, it is not a substitute for reasoning. Be sure you get this last point clear. Some lazy-minded persons think their \"hllnches\" (echoes frotn the personal level of subconsciousness) and the messages from flattering \"voices\", fi.ee thern fi'om all need of reasoning. Their sad failures should, but seldom do, teach them better. Read this lesson carefully with your occult diary at hand. Remember that I(ey 5, besides being a symbolic presentation of esoteric doctrine, has power to arouse your intuitive ability because the symbols act as forceful suggestions to your subconsciousness which is the channel of intuition. The force of these suggestions will be intensified as every detail of the symbolism is impressed on subconsciousness while you carry out the directions below. us0300"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"7'lllOT-l;'tlND/1 A4 liNT'lLS. l3 COLORING INSTRUCTIONS KEY 5.
