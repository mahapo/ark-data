[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Fortv-seven A MONTH OF TAROT PRACTICE You now possess the fundamental knowledge required for your fuither progress. You know enough about each Tarot Key to enable you to grasp more advanced instruction. Yet to make Tarot serve you as it should, you need to become even better acquainted with it. In the hands of experts, it is a powerful instrument for self-transformation and self-mastery. Yet even the greatest adepts in its use once knew less about it than you do now. Do not make the mistake of trying to review Tarot Fundamentals at this time. You don't repeat the formula of introduction every time you meet a new acquaintance. No, you watch his behavior every time you see him in a different set of circumstances. You get to know him better by hearing what he says and seeing what he does. So it is with Tarot. The best way to broaden and deepen your knowledge of it is to see it from as many different points of view as possible. In the course you are now frnishing, you have been taught the alphabet of a universal language. Through symbol and color you will have developed an increased awareness of your self-conscious and subconscious processes. Many of you will already have had flashes of Superconscious states of being. Having come this far, do not sit down by the wayside in order to attempt greater understanding of the alphabet. In the next course, Developing Supersensory Powers, you will learn how to use the Tarot Keys in a way that can change your life immeasurably. In Superconscious states, we see many apparently separated aspects of life as a Whole, and the deeper, underlying meaning of many things in our life becomes clear to us, The next course aims at helping you to develop this state of awareness and teaches you how to apply these insights in your daily life. The Meditations given in this lesson will prepare you for the more intensive Tarot training which is to follow. Remember, you can arrange these twenty two Keys (using them all in each arrangement) no lessthanonesextillionways. Theexactnumberis1,124,000,727,777,607,680,000. There are innumerable other groupings, in which only part of the series is used. Thus the total number of possible alrangements is practically infinite. Every combination has its own special meaning, calls forth its own particular subconscious response, and brings to the surface of your mind some fresh perception of relationships between ideas and things. Thus every combination helps you to organize your mind and enables you to knit more closely the fabric of your thought."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS. In the following pages you will find twenty four combinations. Use one each day, six days a week, beginning the Monday after you receive this lesson.

Write this on a slip of paper and carry it with you during the day. As the day passes, repeat it at least three times. By carrying out this instruction carefully, you will accomplish several desirable results. You will charge your subconsciousness daily with seeds of creative thought. You will also review the entire series of Tarot Keys from a fresh point of view. You will begin to understand from actual experience how wonderfully Tarot can aid you in living the liberated life.
