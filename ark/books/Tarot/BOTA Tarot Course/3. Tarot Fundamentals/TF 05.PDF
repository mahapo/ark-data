[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS Lesson Five SnIr-CoNSCIoUSNESS Begin this lesson by examining careftrlly, as a whole and in detail, Key 1, the Magician. Review the meanings of the number l, given in Lesson 2. Everything represented in the symbolism of this I(ey is a development of ideas associated with this number. 'fhe Magician typifies the beginning or inception of the process whereby the limitless possibilities of the Lifb-power are brought into expression as manifested actualities. The Key represents the initiation of the creative process on all planes. ln human personality the creative process is begun by self- consciousness, sometimes called objective mind. Self- consciousness is the ciistinctively human aspect of mental activity. Objective rnind is the waking mind you are using to read these words. Self-conscioLlsness initiates the creative process by formulating premises or seed-ideas. Subconsciousness accepts these as suggestions, which it elaborates by the process of deduction, and carries out in modifications of mental and emotional attitudes. and in definite changes of bodily function and structure. The two sentences you have just read outline a process of utmost importance. You use it continually, whether or not you know you do, because it is tlie basis of your intellectual knowledge, and the determinant of tlie state of your physical health. All your physical and mental states are results of your mental imagery. When you thoroughly understand what is implied by the statement that any mental irnage tends to materialize itself as an actual condition or event, you have the clue to success in occult practice. Geometrically, the number 1 is a point, particularly the central point. In The Pattern on the Trestleboard, the statement attributed to I is: \"l am a center of expression for the Primal Will-to-good which eternally creates and sustains the universe.\" 'Ihe beginning of the creative process is the concentration of the Lif-e-power at a center, and its expression through that center.

It transmits the Lif-e-power as radiant energy which man may utilize in ways innumerable. 'l'his idea is shown in two ways by the letter Beth (5), printed on Key 1. Ancient forms of this character represented an arrow-head, and in Greek the name lbr this implement was kentron, whence come the English words center and concentration. The letter-name Beth nteans \"house,\" whioh is a definite location used as an abode. In the sense used here, it refers to whatever form may be termed a dwelling-place for Spirit, and the form particularly referred to in this lesson is human personality. Personality is a center thror,rgh which the Spirit or real Self of man expresses itself. Do not be abstract about 1his. Think of your personality as a center of expression 1br your own inner Self. Try to realize that this was what Jesus meant when he said: \"The Father who dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.\" 'Ihe title of this Key, the Magician, identifies the picture with Hermes or Mercury who presided over magic. You will remember that Mercury was messenger of the gods and in this capacity served to transmit or express their wisdom and power. This correspondence to Hermes is connected also with another meaning of 1, which, as reprcsenting singlcncss, ai-id therefbre isolation, stands also fbr privacy and concealnrent, and thus for occult or hidden knowledge. Magic is the art of transformation and it is closely allied to the Hermetic art, alchemy. In human personality, self-consciousness is the transformer. 11, and it only, is able to set in motion lbrces which bring about change, variation, etc. The fundamental magical practice is concentration-one-pointed attention to some selected area of one's environment. For example, two people wake up to find that it is raining. The first person gives attention to unhappy associations and expectations connected with rain. I{e will think how dreary the sky looks. F{e will cringe from getting wet. He will stimulate subconscious processes associated with depression and hopelessness. It will have a deleterious eft-ect on his bodily condition as well as emanating forces which nrake for poor relationship with his environment, The second person gives attention to happy associations and expectations connected with rain. He sees the rain washing the laces of the llowers and trees. He rejoices that the plants are drinking from the water of Life and that the conditions for the sustenance of all creatures is herein provided. As he goes out of doors, his heart is lifted in gratitude to the Lord of Lif-e. The rain clroplets caress his cheeks. He is stirnulating subconscious processes associated with richness and joy. It will have a healing effect on his bodily condition. He is emanating a fbrce-the same fbrce. But in this case it brings harmonious and fulfilling relationship with his environment. He is living the Magician. Lts0300"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TARO7\" FUNDAMENTALS: j The practice of concentration enables one to perceive the inner nature of the object of his attention. 'fhis leads to the discovery of natural principles. By applying these, one is able to change his conditions. Henoe concentration helps us solve our problems. Thus we may understand why alchemists wrote : \"Our Mercury enables us to prepare the universal solvent.\" The higher phases of the art which begins with concentration are those which have to do with the underlying principles of human existence. Thus one reason you are using Tarot Keys as objects for concentration is that they represent basic modes of human consciousness. Learn the following definition: Concentration is the collection, at a center or focus, of units of power. These are alr.vays units of the Life-power because every unit of force in the universe, regardless of what form it takes, is a manifestation of that One Force. Understand that you do not concentrate attention. Attention is only the means that enables you to concentrate units of mental fbrce. The result is that you intensify this energy so that you may direct it usefully. When you intensify the rays of the sun by means of a convex lens, they will burn your hand if you direct them upon it. If you place your hand in the sunshine passing through a pane of window-glass, the result is merely a slight sensation of warmth. Never forget that when you practice concentratioll yoLl are working with a real fbrcc. Note the posture of the Magician. With his right hand he draws down power from above. Witli his left hand he makes a gesture of concentration. He is directing power clrawn from higher levels to planes below that of his self-conscious existence. He does this for a specific reason. This picture shows clearly the magical process involved in an understanding of the correct practice of concentration. 'rhe plane below the Magician is represented as a garden which is a symbol of subconsciousness. When you concentrate you seek always to impress some definite image on subconsciousness to the end that yoll may bring about some particular modification of subconscious activity, one selected in advance. One important point to observe is that the Magician himself is not active. He stands perfectly still. He is a channel for a power which comes from above his level, and after passing through hirn, that power sets up a reaction at a lower level than his. As in the illustration of the convex lens, the lens, though it is the agency which intensifies the rays of the sun, does nothing of itself. Self-consciousness in concentration is not itself active. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the old Hebrew name for the mode of consciousness represented by the Magician is Intelligence of Transparency, clearly intimating that self-consciousness effbcts transformations because something works through it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T'I ROT F I] N D A fuT EN 7-A LS Again, the digit 1, as the beginning of the numeral series, is the sign of a thing standing in relation to other things. What stands in relation to other things is connected with them by various links or bonds. Magic is the science of hidden relationships. The practice of magic is based on the law of correspondence expressed in the Hermetic axiom: \"That which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above.\" 'Ihe bond between things is fundamentally their co-existence as nranif-estations of the Lif'e- power. All things are governed by one great Law. All things are masks of appearance for a single Reality. All things are parts of one great Whole from which nothing can be detached. Whatever is done to a part affbcts the whole. In human relationships this is unalterably true. Therefore was it said: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye lrave done it unto me.\" Magic is the art whioh produces effects by mastery of the secret forces of nature. It is the science of Zoroaster and of Hermes-the science of which all other sciences are but branches, the science which sent its representatives to pay homage to the Child of Bethlehern. Magic is the science of initiation. An initiatol is one who has mastered this hidden science of causes. FIe knows how to direct the universal creative force so as to bring about, by methods which seem miracitlous to those r,vho do not ltnor,v the secret, the full realization ancl physical embodiment of the aims and purposes expressed by his mental imagery. A perfbcted magician uses his objective mind, or self-consciousness, in the manner depicted by this Tarot I(ey. Endeavor, therefore, as yoll color the picture, to impress all its details on your memory. In the next lesson you will find their significance explained. For the coming week, concern yourself only with the coloring and with getting the picture, as a whole and in detail, into your mind. tls0300"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TAROT FUNDAMENTALS., -' COLORING INSTRUCTIONS KEY I.
