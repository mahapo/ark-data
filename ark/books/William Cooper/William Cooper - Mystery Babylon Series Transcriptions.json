I'm your host, William Cooper. (opening music: Also sprach Zarathustra (theme song of 2001: A Space Odyssey ) by Richard Strauss) When I first saw the movie 2001 , I was amazed, awed, to say the least. The entire scope of the movie was overpowering and, for most of the people of the world, was completely baffling. Most people who saw that movie did not understand from beginning to end what it was that they had experienced, but they knew, everyone who saw it, knew that they had experienced something profound. That something had been communicated to the dark, deep recesses of their mind which they did not understand and, indeed, which they were incapable of understanding. For you see, the movie was not meant for the \"profane\" as most of us are called by the Adepts, or the Initiates, or the priests of the Mystery Schools. For that movie was a message to those Initiates who were well versed in the symbology and the Mystery Religion of an ancient religion that is practiced to this day in secret. Now, I’m going to tell you the meaning of the symbology that you saw in the movie 2001 , and then each and every listener should go to their local video rental store and watch the movie again from beginning to end. For it is the story of the entire human race, according to the history of the Mystery Religion of ancient Babylon. Now, I can assure you that you will not understand any of what you are going to hear without ample preparation, and without a basic understanding in the symbology of the ancient religion. And you're going to get that. And this is going to be a series of programs that will, in fact, take probably many hours to complete. But let me just go over the symbology of the movie 2001 quickly with you, and then we will go back to the very beginning, to the first primitive human, probably sitting on his haunches, munching upon some vegetable, watching the sun rise in the east. In the beginning of the movie 2001 , most people who sat in the theater were struck by the imagery which was presented to them, as they first saw a dark and grey and ugly world. And as that world begin [sic] to move down from the center of the scree, they saw behind it, a moon. And as the moon begin to come down with the world that was sinking to the lower part of the screen behind it you saw the emergence of the sun. What you are witnessing was an eclipse of the sun, partial eclipse, and as the light from the sun spilled across the edge of the moon, it took the shape of the boat of Isis and the sun, of course, for anyone who has studied, the Osirian cycle became Osiris. And the symbology was Osiris riding across the heavens upon the boat of Isis. Now, this will all have much deeper meaning to you as we progress toward your education in the ancient Mystery Schools, which are today known by many different names, and we will get to some of those names as we go along. This signified, of course, the creation of the universe and of the world. And what we saw next was a barren plain: nothing growing, barren rocks, barren desert. And then we saw the sun begin to rise in the east over the horizon, signifying the birth of the world. As the sun traveled across the heavens, you saw the wind begin to move across the face of the earth, signifying that something was happening. Then, as the sun began to reach its zenith on a prime longitude, we began to see shrubs. Small green plants began to emerge. Now, the sun traveling across the heavens did not, of course, signify a day. It signified an age. An age, dear listeners. As the sun sank deeper into the afternoon, we saw the emergence of animal life: birds, and we could hear the birds singing, and we can see the animals. And then, we can see primitive, primitive man in the form of an ape, mingling amongst the animals, neither harming the other, living in a state of innocence. And you saw man only eating plants and roots. You saw that, even when the animals and man were in competition for food, no one was injured or hurt, but there was a display of waving of arms, and yelling and grunting until one or the other moved away. The significance of this was the age of innocence, when man lived in the Garden of Eden. Innocent; with the animals, it was a vegetarian [sic]. And as the sun progressed farther toward the west, we saw man begin to retreat into the womb. For you see, the passage of the sun across the sky, from the time that it rose in the east, signifying the birth of the world, we saw that as it reached its zenith, its most powerful aspect in the heavens, life began to emerge, first in the form of plants, and then animal life, and that the animals and early man lived in harmony together in a state of innocence. This was the symbology of the movie. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"During this process, you saw a rock formation in the shape of the male organ, the penis. This was the symbol of the Mystery Schools, of the generative force of creation. When you watch the movie again, pay attention to the symbology of the movie. Now, as the sun begins to sink even farther in the west, man and his little tribe goes to the water hole and confronts another group of primitive man, all in form of the ape. And there is a confrontation, but you notice that no one was injured or killed. There was a lot of waving of arms, jumping up and down, grunting and screaming and screeching, until the group that was at the watering hole and had already quenched their thirst moved away, and then the new group moved in. And then they scurried into the womb signified by the cave. And there was more symbology there, as they all sat in the darkness with their eyes open in fear, and one of the female apes held a child to her breast. And you were seeing man in the transformation from ape to human. Primitive man, evolving to the point where he could think. And then what happened in the movie, toward the dawn, you heard the humming of bees, millions of bees. And the beehive and bees were a prominent symbol in the Mystery Schools. It signifies societal cohesion; industry. Now, not industry as you may know it in the manufacture of cars, but industry in working together in a societal form. In this case, the very basic rudiments of society. And as the sun again begin, began to rise up in the east, signifying the dawn of the new man, the audience beheld an obelisk, a monolith in front of the cave, or the womb, from which the apes emerged. And it appeared that the humming of the bees was emanating from this block of stone. Now, notice I said three words: monolith, obelisk and stone. All of these are significant symbols in the ancient Mystery Religions. And you saw that this was not God, because creation had already taken place. The world had been created, plants and animals had been created, and primitive man existed on the earth before this monolith, this obelisk, this stone ever made its appearance. It is also known as, the stone that you saw earlier, the generative force or the penis. Now, don’t get all confused by this terminology. It will begin to make sense to you as we go along. It took me many years of study to understand what I am now imparting to you. You watched as the apes milled about in great excitement, and one encouraged by another, signifying Adam and Eve (the one encouraging was the symbol of Eve, the one being encouraged was Adam) until he actually reached out and touched the face of the stone and he was imparted intellect. You can tell that something significant had happened because the tone and the general volume of the music changed at that point. And then the other apes began to touch and rub the statue. Now, most people that I knew attributed what happened to some extraterrestrial force, and they were receiving the exoteric interpretation, or that which is meant for the profane, those who were not illumined and cannot understand what it is they are seeing. But for the initiated, what they witnessed was the creation of the world by God and the impartation of knowledge to man, the forbidden knowledge, by Lucifer through his agent, Satan. For in the religion of the Mystery Schools, they believe that man was held prisoner in the Garden of Eden by an unjust and vindictive God, and that man was not told by this unjust and vindictive God that he could have the same powers. And man was set free from the bonds of ignorance by Lucifer through his agent, Satan. And many believe that the two are the same, and that’s OK, because maybe they are. And that, through the gift of intellect, man, himself, will become God. Now, for those of you who understand what I am imparting to you now, you may not even have to listen any farther, for it explains everything that has ever happened in the history of man, and everything that is happening now, and all that is to happen in the future. As it progressed, you saw the first primitive man form the first original thought with the use of the gift of intellect when he squatted in the dust, and picked up a bone, and flopped the bone over, and saw it hit a rib, and the rib flew up into the air and he looked at it. Then he flopped it to the other side and hit another piece of rib bone that flew up into the air, and you could see the wheels turning in the mind of this primitive individual, as he lifted the thigh bone and then struck down in front of him and watched bones fly. And then he struck again and again, and then he crushed the skull of the dead animal that was lying in front of him. And you notice that the portrayal of this was absolutely accurate, because the next thing that happened was that this new gift, this intellect and this original thought, led to the murder of another primitive human being. In this case, of the tribe that had not been given the gift of intellect, did not have the ability to use a bone as a weapon because they had not made the connection. And you watched, in the symbology of that movie, the murder of Abel by his brother Cain. And you watched as he threw the bone up into the air, and the progression of the use of the gift of intellect led you to a space station spinning around the earth. And then the story began of man's journey toward illumination. And everything in that movie was a symbol for something else. Now, the audience sitting who are what the Adepts, or the Initiates, call profane did not understand what they saw. They thought that it was really about a journey into space by an astronaut, or a group of astronauts, and the bad things that happened to some of them and one survived [sic]. And none of them understood the significance of the obelisks, the monoliths: one on the moon, one in orbit around Jupiter, and the ultimate transformation of the astronaut into a giant fetus floating in space. And to tell you the truth, when I first saw the movie, I didn’t really understand it either, but I knew that there was something of such import there, that I needed to know. And I never stopped studying until I found out. And of course, one discovery leads to another. And every time I answered a question, a hundred more popped up until I reached a point, dear listeners, where I realized that if I studied for the entire rest of my life, there is not enough time in my life to learn what it is that I need to know. But I have learned enough along the way to impart some of my knowledge to you, and maybe you can help me find the ultimate truth that all of us, all of us, ultimately learn to look for, although not all of us ever realized that we are looking, and most of us never even understand what it is that we are looking 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for, but some of us do understand that we are looking. The Adepts, or the Initiates, the priesthood of the Mystery School, believe that they have found it and that they know all of these things. And I'm not really sure that they do. Because in my search in my ultimate illumination – (laughs) and yes, I have become, to a degree, illumined, illuminated – I have discovered that I am more illuminated then most of those who have gone through the process of initiation in the Mystery Schools and believe that they know more then I do, and it's not true. I have surpassed them by so far, and they believe that they are so far ahead. That it has become difficult for me to place myself in any kind of logical progression along a path that I am following, and I know not where it will ultimately lead. But I know that many have been misled along this path, and are worshiping the fallen angel that we know as Lucifer. Many believe that Lucifer and Satan are the same; many people believe that they are totally different entities, and that Satan is evil and Lucifer is not. But Lucifer rebelled against God, according to the Bible, and was expelled from heaven and flung to the earth to be the master of the material world, the master of the earth. Now, if Lucifer is indeed Satan, how this transformation took place, I am not wise enough to know. If they are different, then I have not yet discovered where Satan came from, if Lucifer is not Satan. Now, there are people who have professed to know the answers to these questions, and have have sat down and we have talked for hours, and I still am not sure that they are right or that they are wrong. And I’m still looking for the answer to that question. But I do know this: ancient man witnessed something that he described in his oral history and in his writings. And it could probably be called the first UFO sighting in the history of the world. [reading from Isaiah 14:12] \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning [star]!\" Now notice, Lucifer was called the \"son of the morning star\". He was also called the \"morning star\", and there is a great mystery here, because Christ also called himself the \"morning star\". Now, how all that fits together, I do not know, but I have been told by those who have been initiated in the Mystery Schools that Christ and Lucifer are one and the same being. However, I cannot bring myself to believe that. What you believe, of course, is your own business, and it is not my intention to make you believe anything, but rather to impart to you what I have learned over many, many years of study into the secrets of those who worship the ancient Mystery Religions in secret for thousands of years. For you see, that monkey who sat there squatting on his haunches in the desert, striking the earth and the pile of bones with this great thigh bone, was the first priest of the Mystery Schools. And it was this first priest who then began to initiate others into the secrets. And they are the ones who have been responsible, according to my research, for most of the scientific developments and the forward movement, as far as material progress goes, of the human race, for they were the learners. They were the ones who developed science. They were the ones who hid their developments, and used their science and their knowledge and their secrets to govern others. Usually not as kings, but as advisors and as priests, and, in all actuality, the powers behind the thrones in ancient times, and even today. They have ruled from the shadows, you see. And they have call themselves the Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages. And their first, their first, religion was called astro ‐ theology, or the worship of the heavens, and their first object of worship was the sun. The second object of worship was the moon. And everywhere you see this Mystery Schools, or the Mystery Religion, you will see the symbols of the sun and the moon, also known as Osiris and Isis, and the child Horus, which I will explain the meaning of later. Right now, folks, we must take a break. Don't go away, I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: continuing Also sprach Zarathustra (theme song of 2001: A Space Odyssey ) by Richard Strauss) Man's new found intellect set him upon a quest that, according to those who say that they know, has never ended, even unto this day. And the modern ‐ day equivalent of this ancient Mystery Religion calls itself the Order of the Quest. And you will see it reflected in many of their outward, exoteric branches, where they disseminate information to the public, or manipulate the public, or deceive the public, as the profane to them are nothing more than cattle to be herded, and occasionally to be led to the slaughter. In the movie 2001 , the quest led them ultimately into space and to the moon, where they were further imparted knowledge, by Lucifer again, in the form of the obelisk, the monolith, the stone, the penis. And you will understand what that means later when we get into the Osirian cycle, or the legend of Isis, Osiris and the child, Horus. When they were imparted knowledge again on the moon, it set them off on a further quest to the planet Jupiter, where they found a huge tremendous, again, another obelisk, monolith, stone, the generative force, the penis, floating in space, orbiting the planet Jupiter. Now, the journey from the moon to Jupiter is significant, for the astronauts on board this spaceship represented the entirety of the human race, and it represented that some will evolve, and those who cannot will not be allowed into the future. You see, this was a message from those who rule to all of the Initiates of the world. It was a message that the new age is now dawning. And you see that, at one point during this journey from the moon to Jupiter, man, represented on a microcosm by the astronauts making this voyage, came in conflict with their own technology. The technology of the human race was represented by the computer called HAL, 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"and for those who were intelligent enough to experiment with the name HAL, and progressed the letters one forward in the alphabet from what they were in the movie, H became I, A became B, and L became M, and they were able to see that the symbol was of the largest at that time when the movie was made and the corporation that was on the cutting edge of computer technology, IBM [sic]. It was significant that man had built this technology, this computer, which had an artificial intelligence and was capable of communicating with the astronauts, and yet they had forgotten to put a switch in the machine which could be turned off at will. Now, you have to understand that this is all symbology. HAL represented many things. He represented the atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb, chemical warfare, bacteriological warfare. Represented the state of the art of technology, where it became so complicated that no one man could be an expert in it, and thus might unknowingly participate in the building of a technology which could destroy him, yet he only worked on a part or portion of it. The knowledge of which did not indicate to him that the end product could be a danger, and we see that happening now, don’t we? Where everybody has to specialize in one small portion of technology, because the overall picture is so complicated and so far beyond our understanding, that we see the prediction made in the movie 2001 actually becoming true before our very eyes. Just in my lifetime, I’ve seen automobiles that I can take apart and put together blindfolded myself as a teenager, to driving automobiles that I can lift the hood and not even recognize most of what I’m looking at, except that I know that it's an engine in there, and I know that it's got a fuel delivery system, and some kind of system that ignites the fuel, but the technology has surpassed my ability to take it apart and put it back together again without many months or years of specialized training. And this has occurred across the board in our technology, and as I told you before, I will tell you again tonight, dear listeners: in secret, whatever you perceive as the state of technology in the public eye, the very cutting edge, in secret, they are a minimum a 50 to 100 years ahead, to the point where science fiction is no longer fiction, and hasn’t been for quite some time, but is, in all actuality, science fact. You saw this battle play itself out on board this space ship, where ultimately there was only one astronaut left fighting the battle against HAL. And he was able to make this jump in his evolutionary consciousness, and he was able to fool HAL and turn off the computer. But when he did so he knew that he had relegated himself to permanent separation from his fellow human beings back on earth. And, folks, the message was not that he went into space to affect this separation. Space was just the vehicle through which it was conveyed in the movie. The message was that the new man will go into the future and the rest of us will perish. We will not be allowed into the future. If we are, it will be as slave labor until we were no longer useful, and then we will simply be exterminated. The message to the vast army of Initiates, the Mystery School, was we are on the threshold of the new age, and into this new age will march only one, one, man. It is the new man, it is the illumined man, it is the man that is able to make the evolutionary jump to no more war, to no more rape, no more pillage, to the level in the Mystery School known as 666. It is the number of a man. It is the illumined man to the Mystery Schools. To those of us who are Christians, it is the symbol, mark of the beast, the indication that the Antichrist has arrived, and the beginning of the time predicted in the Book of Revelation known as the Tribulation. Now, all of this that I thought I knew so well and understood has become even more mysterious to me now, as I know that I am battling against something that is almost incomprehensible and I have had to do it alone, by myself, not trusting anyone else, not letting them in, for fear that they would corrupt my mind and I would be led down the wrong path. And I still do not know the answers, but I have an awful lot of clues, and a lot of facts, and I have learned an awful lot, and maybe I am more confused than I ever was in my entire life. But after you hear the results of what I have learned, and after I’m [sic], for the first time since I’ve learned all of this, communicated to other human beings to let you know how really confused I am, maybe all of us being confused together can put the pieces in the places, and patch this mystery together, and come up what we need as answers to formulate a future that we can all, all enjoy, without fear, without wars, without lies and deception and manipulation, without elitists and terrorists, crooks and liars. For I am going to impart to you during all of this that the priests of the ancient Mystery Religion are the ones who have caused most of the misery in the history of man. And if they have not learned this knowledge, the Secrets of the Ages that they keep from the rest of us and use to manipulate us, maybe, maybe we would have reached peace in this world hundreds of years ago. I don’t really know the answer to that, but I don’t think much of what has happened in the history of the world that was miserable, terrible, would have happened without these people. But I may be wrong, and as always when you listen to this show, don’t believe a word you hear unless you can substantiate it in your own research. Now at the end of the movie, what you saw as the astronaut became older and aged, and this was the symbol of gaining knowledge and wisdom, and he looked at himself and he saw himself younger, and he looked back and saw himself older, and he looked back and he was older still, and he looked back and he was young again, and then old, and then he saw this unbelievably overpowering, stunning vision of a fetus, a human fetus, floating in the great vastness of the universe, signifying the birth of the new age, and the new man, that will go into the future. And on the sequel to 2001 , you saw that this astronaut, who had made the jump, came back and talked to some select few, signifying that he had then become a teacher to the rest of us, and when he was asked what happened to him, he said, and I quote, “something 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"wonderful.” Now, that was supposed to tell the rest of the Initiates of the world, who really understood the symbology of the movie, that if they were able to make this transition, the future would be a Utopia. Now, I don’t know whether it will be or not, but I can tell you this: the priests of the ancient Mystery Religions are in charge right now, and we had better damn well find out, and we had better do it very quickly, for the new age is the age of Aquarius, and the exact date of the dawning of the Age of Aquarius can be determined astrologically and I’m not going to tell you what that date is although I have it right here on a piece of paper in front of me. I want you all to help in this search. God knows I need help. I can’t save us all alone, and there is always the possibility, because I am human, that I can make the wrong decision, or make the wrong interpretation, and that’s why I formed CAJI, because many of us working together and digging and searching for information are much more likely not to make the mistakes then one man working alone. Let's go back now to the beginning, when man was in his infancy on the evolutionary scale of development. Man was alone. Alone in the sense that he did not have all of the help and the knowledge that we have today that enables us to survive. You see, man was then subject to the cold, to the wild beasts of prey. He didn’t have a home, he didn’t have air conditioning in the summer, didn’t have heating in the winter, didn’t have medical doctors. If he became ill or injured, he was most likely to die. So, it did not take ancient man very long to decide that, in this world, the single greatest enemy to be feared was the darkness of night, and all the unknown dangers that came with it. And simply stated, man's first enemy was darkness. Now, understanding this one fact alone, one can readily see why the greatest and most trustworthy friend the human race could ever have at that time was, by far, heaven's greatest gift to the world: that glorious rising orb of day that we call the sun. And that was the beginning of the battle between light and darkness, and it was man's first understanding of the birth, the death, and the rebirth of a deity. For the sun rose (was born in the morning), traveled across the heavens, where it reached its most powerful point, the zenith (and that will explain why so many things occur at noon, or near noon), and then, signifying old age and the end of its life, sank into the west and then died. And man was subjected to the rigors, the dangers, the cold of night until as god again was reborn the next morning. Now, folks, I’m not making any of this up, and it took me many, many, years of study to figure this out. Man noticed that the moon also rose, lived a different life than the sun, and then set and died, and was reborn again. The sun, because of its brilliance, became the master, or the greatest deity, and the moon took on the feminine aspect, because the moon reflected the light of her master. And all of this will begin to make sense to you, eventually, as we go through this, because from now on, every program that I do is going to be devoted to this, to the explanation of the esoteric religion, the ancient Mystery Religion. And it's important that we all understand it, because these are the people in charge, and don’t ask me to tell you the truth of religion, for I really believe in the Constitution, and that we all have a right to worship our own god in our own way, and no one has the right to tell anyone, unless asked, what they should believe. You all know by know that I am a Christian, but I'm not a Christian in the sense that I follow the dogma of any church, or the preachings of any preacher, or necessarily, word for word, the Bible. I stick strictly and only to those words that are directly attributed to Jesus Christ, and I attempt to follow those words in my daily life. And it doesn’t matter to me whether anyone proves that he never lived, or that he lived or not. I have found that those are the most profound teachings amongst all of the books and teachings that I have ever heard or read in my entire life. And until someone can prove to me that there is something better, that is what I will always adhere to. I do not advise you what you should believe not believe. But I do advise you that we all need to learn as much as we can about everything that we can, because one thing I have learned in my life is that most of what he have ever been taught has been a lie. And that whoever these people are – and I know who they are, and I will impart that knowledge to you – who are the priests, the Adepts and the Initiates of the Mystery Schools, they are in control and they are shaping the future, and that future will affect all of us. So we had better learn as much about them as much as we can. You cannot identify an enemy unless you know the enemy, and you cannot fight a battle if you know nothing about the battle tactics of your opponent. And when you understand that Lucifer is the son of the morning star, or the morning star itself [audio cuts off for a few seconds] then the creations of the members of the Mystery School begin to make much more sense. Good night, and God bless you all.

I’m your host, William Cooper. Tonight, ladies and gentleman, we begin the origin, the history, the dogma, and the identity of the ancient Mystery Religions, which are now known as the Mystery Schools, the Order of the Quest, Freemasonry, the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross, The Knights Templar, the Sovereign and Military Order of the Knights of Malta, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Prieuré de Sion , the Thule Society, or sometimes known as the Thuley Society, the Order, the Skull and Bones, the Russell Trust, the Jason Society, the Scroll and Key, the Illuminati, and I could go on, and on, and on, and on. But the most important thing to realize is that they all have been collectively known throughout the ages as the Mystery Schools. The Illuminati, which literally means, “illumined ones”. International Socialism, Communism, they are all one and the same as you will come to know, and you will understand perfectly how they've been able to infiltrate all of our society. What you hear tonight does not necessarily reflect my views, or beliefs, or religion...nor those of WWCR. (opening music: I Can See Clearly Now , written by Johnny Nash, performed by Liza Minnelli) That song will have a clearer meaning to you as we progress in your education into the Mystery Religion. But we have to begin in the beginning, with every story and every history. And we have to begin at the beginning of mankind. And the beginning is the beginning according to the Mystery Religion. And they believe, wholeheartedly, that man is a product of evolution, not of an extraterrestrial race, and not of the creation of some benevolent god. [Reading from The Future of Man , written by Robert Klark Graham]: “[They believe that] the tree ‐ dwelling ancestors of man were among the most intelligent beings of their distant age. “And when these creatures finally abandoned the trees and walked fully upright, freeing their hands to serve as implements of their minds as well as their bodies, there began the most successful evolutionary drive toward higher intelligence ever witnessed in Nature. \"As ground dwellers, these creatures were easy victims of the great predators, who hunted them down by day and surprised them at night as they huddled in clearings or in caves. They could not compete in strength, ferocity or speed with their attackers. Armed with little except their hands and what their complex brains enabled them to do with those hands, they had to think or die. For untold thousands of years most of them met early, violent deaths. Only a few in each generation had the good fortune and the ability to outwit their enemies. [And] these favored ones survived long enough to have and rear offspring. The unwary, maladroit or stupid died early. [William Cooper: And folks, I'm afraid that the stupid, who live today, are going to die early also. But back to the beginning.] Their offspring, if they had any, were left to starve or be eaten by predators. \"Natural selection was operating on the earliest types of man with grimmest intensity. Perhaps no other extant creature has undergone so severe and protracted a period of selective elimination. Yet here and there small groups managed to survive because they had the intelligence to use sticks, stones and clubs to defend themselves. Crude and puny as these implements were, they were weapons and their possessors were the first creatures who could kill without having to come in direct contact with their antagonists. \"'As the great beasts grew larger and either faster or more formidable, man became ever more watchful, ever more successful in pitting 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"his wits against mass and power, more and more adept at slipping out of trouble, and as the challenge grew greater, so did his brain, for the laggards on both sides got left behind in the race for the future.' [Quoted from Norman J. Bernill's Man's Emerging Mind ]\" [William Cooper]: ...and we are still engaged in that race for the future. \"The steps in the development, of man's brain are revealed by the progressively larger braincases which appeared with the passage of centuries. Basing our judgment on the improvements in tools and weapons which took place as the intelligence of their inventors increased, we can construct some of the ways in which natural selection may have worked to bring about a doubling in size of the human brain. \"Many edible nuts are too hard for even a caveman to crack between his teeth. Accordingly, they were useless to early man, until some genius of his day discovered that any nut could be opened if it were just placed up on one stone and stuck hard with another. Better fed, the family of this innovator proliferated while the others died off. \"Perhaps centuries later, while a man sat cracking nuts between two stones, one stone broke and the broken edge cut his hand. Previously, men in the same situation had thrown the broken stone away and nursed their cuts. But this man, this man started thinking. [William Cooper: He possessed an original thought.] Since the edge had cut through his skin and drawn blood, it might also cut through the skin of the small animals he caught, making it easier to get at the meat. The first knife was invented! He and those close to him, and those intelligent enough to imitate him, increased in number [William Cooper: and the rest died off]. They had a cutting tool which made it possible for them to skin and eat meat in less time, so they had more time for hunting. Many of the descendants of this exceptional man became increasingly skillful at breaking and chipping hard stones into sharper tools and weapons.\" [William Cooper]: And if you’ve been to a museum of natural history, and you’ve seen these fine, beautiful flint arrowheads and spearheads, then you know that it took patience and great skill, and this means a further development of the human mind. \"Natural selection, favoring better knife makers, went on for hundreds of thousands of years [William Cooper: according to those who guard the Secrets of the Ages, and even according to modern science]. \"A great many centuries later a young father foraging for his brood, may have come upon a long straight stick, splintered at one end. [Well] he pulled and chewed at the splinters until only one stout point was left [William Cooper: or at least that's how we can imagine that it was done]. It seemed to him a very useful stick, for it was sharper than the digging sticks, which the women used. He may have remembered a night during his boyhood, when a great cat had charged his family's campsite and dragged away a younger sister. Now that he had small children of his own, the memory of that attack was ever present. Lately, he had seen fresh panther tracks. Another family, not far away, had been attacked and the mother had been killed. His dawning intelligence told him his pointed stick might be a better weapon against big cats than the clubs which he and the other men carried. [So] for many days he kept the long stick near him, even when he was laughed at for having what was regarded as a woman’s tool.\" [William Cooper]: Not only did he possess a greater intellect than his fellow man, but he possessed more courage to resist their laughter. \"Then one night, he heard a faint rustling. He whispered a quick warning to his family. Suddenly, a dim shape charged at him in the darkness. Kneeling, he raised the point of his long stick toward the beast. It sprang, clawed at him savagely, then fled! The creature had struck the point so hard that the blunt end of the stick was shoved deep, deep into the ground. \"Next morning, following a trail of blood, the man found a panther dead from a punctured chest. The long, sharp stick had saved his life and the lives of his family members. In the same situation less perceptive men, armed only with clubs, would have been killed. \"From that time he, his sons and their sons, carried impaling sticks whenever big predators were near. Foresight, genetically transmitted to their descendants, had given them a new weapon, which they used with devastating effect against their natural enemies. \"Perhaps many generations later a bright descendant of the inventor of the impaling stick mated with the daughter of a man who had thought of throwing a club at fruits, nuts and small animals on the lower branches of trees. Now and then, this brought down an extra meal. \"The man who knew how to defend his family from feline prowlers soon learned from his woman the new way to collect additional food. [And] their young family thrived and some of the children, with good mental inheritance from both sides of the family, showed an even higher order of intelligence than either of their parents. With impaling sticks added to their clubs and cutting stones, men no longer had to be such furtive food gatherers. The hunted gradually evolved into hunters. And in times of famine when battles over food were fierce, those with impaling sticks threw them with deadly 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"accuracy at members of other hunting bands. Sharper stone knives and spears gave a double survival advantage during times of crisis, but the most telling gains were the increasing sharpness of minds. \"'However incomplete our knowledge of human ancestry, there [was] scarcely any doubt that the development of brain power, of intelligence, was the decisive force in the evolutionary process which culminated in the appearance of the species to which we belong. Natural selection [they believe] has brought about the evolutionary trends towards increasing brain power because brain power confers enormous adaptive advantages on its possessors. It is obviously brain power, not body power, which makes man, by far, the most successful, biological species which living matter has produced.' [quote from Theodosius G. Dobzhansky's book, Evolution, Genetics and Man ]\" [Reading from That Old ‐ Time Religion , written by Jordan Maxwell]: \"[Even with man's new weapons and tools] it did not take him very long to decide that in this world the single greatest enemy to be feared was the darkness of night, and all the unknown dangers that came with it. Simply stated, 'MAN'S FIRST ENEMY WAS DARKNESS.' \"Understanding this one fact alone, one can readily see why the greatest and most trustworthy friend the human race could ever have was, by far, heaven's greatest gift to the world...that Glorious Rising Orb of Day [the Sun].\" [William Cooper]: And with this simple truth understood, we can now begin to unravel the most ancient, and still the most successful, religion upon the face of this earth. Its success lies in its ability to remain hidden from the rest of the people. But first, let me assure you, folks, that no people of the ancient world believed that the Sun to be God. In point of fact, every ancient culture and nation on earth have all used the Sun as the most logically appropriate symbol to represent the glory of the unseen creator of the heavens. In the Old Testament, it says, “The heavens are declaring the glory of God.” That's in Psalms 19, verse 1. In the Old Testament, “The sun of righteousness will arise.” Malachi, chapter 4, verse 2. \"The ancient peoples reasoned that no one on Earth could ever lay claim of ownership to the Great Orb of Day. It must belong to the unseen Creator of the Universe...[It became], figuratively speaking, not man's, but 'GOD'S SUN'. Truly, 'God's Sun/Son was...THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. \"As I stated before, [folks,] in the dark cold of night man realized his utter vulnerability to the elements. Each night, mankind was forced to wait for the [rising of the sun] to chase away the physical and mental insecurity brought on by the darkness. Therefore, the morning Sun focused man's attention on heavenly dependence for his frail, short existence on Earth, and in doing so, it became the appropriate symbol of divine benevolence from heaven.\" [William Cooper]: For without the sun, there was no light, there was no warmth, and nothing could grow or live upon the face of this earth. So, just as a small fire brought limited light into man's own little world of darkness, likewise, the great fire of day served the whole earth with its heavenly presence. For this reason, it was said that the God of the Bible was a consuming fire in heaven, and so he was. \"It was accepted by all that man was bound to a life on Earth, but the sky was the [William Cooper: abode of God's son. He resided up there, in heaven]. \"Ancient man saw in his male offspring his own image and likeness, and his own existence as a father was proved by the person of his son. It was assumed that God’s 'Sun' was but a visible representative of the unseen Creator in heaven. So it was said, 'When you have seen the Sun, you have seen the Father.' [Said another way,] 'The Father is glorified in his Sun.' \"Ancient man [William Cooper: even with his limited intelligence at that time] had no problem understanding that all life on Earth depended directly on life ‐ giving energy from the Sun. Consequently, all life was lost without the sun. It followed that God's 'Sun' was nothing less than [man's savior]. \"Since...energy from the Sun gave life, and we sustained our very existence by taking energy in from our food (which came directly from God’s Sun), the Sun must give up its life supporting energy so that we may continue to live. 'God’s Sun [must give] his life for us to live.'\" [William Cooper]: I know that if you are intelligent out there listening, you are making some connections here. You see, the Mystery Schools believe that Christianity is a perversion of the Mysteries. \"While it was plainly true that our life came from and was sustained each day by 'Our Savior...God's Sun', it was and would be true only as long as the Sun would return each morning. [And] our hope of salvation would be secure only in a 'RISEN' savior. For if he did not rise 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"from his grave of darkness, all would be lost. All the world waited for his 'imminent return' [each morning]. The...Father would never leave us at the mercy of this world of darkness. [The] Heavenly promise...was surely that...'He would come again'...to light our path, and save those lost in the darkness... \"Logically, even if man himself died, as long as the Sun comes up each day, life on Earth will continue forever. Therefore, it was said in the ancient texts that everlasting life was 'the gift'...the Father gives through his Sun. For... 'God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten SUN that we may have life everlasting'...on Earth! [William Cooper: And the ancient text did not mean] for you personally ‐ but ON EARTH...everlasting life!\" [William Cooper]: That is the interpretation of the Mystery Schools. \"Since evil and harm lurked at every turn in the fearful dark of night, all evil or harmful deeds were naturally, the...'works of darkness.' \"[And] with the return of the Sun each morning, man felt more secure in his world and therefore, was at peace. Therefore, God's 'Sun' was with his warm rays of hope...The Great 'Prince of Peace'. \"And of course the reverse was equally true. The...evil of night was ruled over by none other than...[the] 'Prince of Darkness' [William Cooper: Hence, evil is of the dark, or the Devil].\" It was only a short step to see [that] 'The Light of God's Sun' equated with [righteousness and] truth ‐ and evil with darkness. From then on, it was simple to understand...LIGHT was GOOD ‐ DARK was BAD.\" [William Cooper]: And the priests of the ancient Mystery Religion always followed the light. They always looked toward the East. They considered themselves to be illumined. \"That being true, then the Great Orb of Day (God's Sun) could rightly say of itself [that], 'I AM THE LIGHT' [and the truth]. \"We should all [William Cooper: in their words, not mine] 'give thanks' to the Father for sending us His 'Sun'...\" [William Cooper]: ...spelled S ‐ U ‐ N, in case some of you are getting confused. In every instance where I have mentioned the word sun , it has been in reference to the sun, S ‐ U ‐ N. \"For the peace and tranquility he brings to our life is even called 'Solace' [William Cooper: solace is from the word solar, which means sun]...\" [William Cooper]: Are you beginning to see the light? (laughs) \"We now have before us two cosmic brothers ‐ one very good, and one very [bad]. One brings the 'truth to light' with the 'light of truth'. The other is the opposite, or in opposition to the light ‐ 'The Opposer'...[the] Prince of [the] World of Darkness... \"It is at this point...we come to Egypt. More than 3,000 years before Christianity began, the early morning [Sun, the Savior] was pictured in Egypt as the 'New Born Babe'. The infant savior's name was 'HORUS'. \"The early morning Sun, or 'New Born Babe', was pictured in two ways: the Dove ‐ [known as the] Bringer of Peace, the Hawk ‐ [the] God of War (who punishes the enemies of God!).\" [William Cooper]: Today, in government, we still use these terms, doves and hawks, and that’s how powerful this hidden religion is; is that we use the terms of this religion even today and know it not. \"At daybreak, this wonderful newborn child is of course 'Born Again' (hallelujah). Horus is Risen. [William Cooper: That is what hallelujah means.] Even today, when the Sun comes up, we see it on the \"Horus ‐ Risen\", or \"HORIZON\". His life was also divided into 12 parts or 12 'Horus=hours' [William Cooper: the twelve signs of the Zodiac]. \"But now, what about the evil brother of God's Sun, that...old Prince of Darkness himself? In the Egyptian belief system he was called 'SET' [William Cooper: or sometimes Typhon]. We are told in the Bible that when God's Sun died, the world was left in the hands of the Prince of Darkness at... SUN ‐ SET.\" [William Cooper]: SUN ‐ SET. Do you understand? God's Sun was killed by the Prince of Darkness, \"SET\", at SUN ‐ SET. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"It was generally observed that 'God's Sun' could be depended upon to return in the same manner that he left ‐ namely, 'On a Cloud'...and 'Every eye will see Him'...(unless, of course, you're blind or dead). \"Keeping in mind that 'God's Sun' not only represented the light of truth, but was put to death by His enemies who could not endure the light of truth in their life, it was taught by the ancients that the very act of opposing or denying the light of truth to the point of killing it, happened in one's own mind! When we are confronted with harsh realities of life [the truth], the light of truth, which we do not wish to face, and which runs counter to our views, such truth is put to death by your mind, and in your head ! Therefore, 'God's Sun' ‐ The Truth and The Light ‐ is put to death at the 'PLACE OF THE SKULL,' or 'SKULL PLACE,' located somewhere between your ears! This putting to death of the light of hope in your mind is always accompanied by the two thieves: Regret for the past and Fear of the future.\" [William Cooper]: Don’t go away folks, we have to take a short break. I'll be back right after this pause. (break music: unknown instrumental piece) [continuing reading from That Old ‐ Time Religion ]: \"And of course 'God's Sun' goes to his death wearing a 'corona' ‐ [Which in] Latin [means] 'CROWN OF THORNS'. Remember the Statue of liberty? [William Cooper: It was given to us by Masonic France.] To this day, kings still wear a round crown of thorns , symbolizing the [rays of the sun]. \"[Now] as far back as we can go into the ancient world [in our research], we find that all known cultures had a 'THREE ‐ IN ‐ ONE' [or] TRIUNE GOD. The very first trinity was simply the three stages of life of the sun: New Born at dawn, Mature or full grown [in its full power] at 12 noon , and old and dying , at the end of day (going back to The Father . All three were of course ONE DIVINITY! THE TRINTIY IS NOT MYSTERY [in the Mystery Schools]!! \"The Egyptians knew that the Sun was at its highest point in the sky (or high noon) when no shadow was cast by the pyramid. At that point, all Egypt offered prayers to the 'Most High ' God! \"As stated before, to the ancients, the sky was the abode, or heavenly temple of the 'MOST HIGH.' Therefore, 'God's Sun' was doing his heavenly Father's work in the temple at [noon]. \"The world of ancient man kept track of times and seasons by the movement of the Sun ‐ daily, monthly and yearly. For this, the sundial was devised. Not only was the daily movement of the sun tracked on the round dial, but the whole year was charted on a round calendar dial. Examples [are]: Ancient Mexican, Mayan, Inca, Aztec, Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Celtic [or Celtic as some pronounce it], Aryan, etc. [And] with this method, certain new concepts emerged in the mind of ancient man. \"Since the Earth experienced four different seasons, all the same and equal (in time) each year, the round calendar was divided into four equal parts. This represented the complete story of the life of 'God's Sun'. This is also why we have, in the Bible, only four gospels. Of this point there can be no doubt. [For] Tertullian and many early church fathers stated this [exact fact themselves in their own writings]. \"[And] this [the Mystery School claims] is why the famous painting of the 'Last Supper' pictures the 12 followers [or houses] of the Sun in four groups (of 3)...the seasons [with the Sun in the center alone.]! \"On the round surface of the yearly calendar, you draw a straight line directly across the middle, cutting the circle in half ‐ one end being the point of the winter solstice , the other end being the point of the summer solstice . Then draw another straight line (crossing the first one). One end of the new line being the spring equinox , the other end being the autumn equinox . You now have the starting points for each of the four seasons. This is referred to by all major encyclopedias and reference works, both ancient and modern, as ' The Cross of the Zodiac '. Thus, the life of God's ' Sun ' is on ' the Cross '. This is why we see the round circle of the Sun on the crosses of Christian churches. The next time you pass a Christian church, look for the circle (Sun) on the cross. \"On December 22nd, the Sun , going south, reaches its lowest point in the sky (our winter solstice). At that lowest point, the Sun stops moving on the sundial for three days , Dec 22nd, Dec 23rd, and Dec 24th in the Southern Constellation known as the Southern Cross . Hence our Savior (dead for three days) died on THE CROSS . The 'SOUTHERN CROSS CONSTELLATION,' that is. \"This is the only time of the year [folks] that the Sun actually stops its movement in our sky [William Cooper: according to the Mystery Schools]. On the morning of Dec. 25th, the Sun begins its annual journey back to us in the northern hemisphere, bringing, of course, our 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"spring. Therefore, on Dec 25th, the Sun is BORN AGAIN. And to this day, His worshipers celebrate His BIRTHDAY! \"It is at this point that we should look at the significance of the recurring number 12 in the Bible. First, 13 is said to be unlucky for humans. It is a heavenly number and represents...the Sun + 'the 12' = 13!\" [William Cooper]: Or Christ plus the 12 disciples equals 13. It's unlucky for a different reason, folks, and I will explain that on another program. But it has to do with the persecution of the Mystery School, the Mystery Religion. \"It would be well to get a Bible Concordance and look to see how many times the number 12 is used in the entire Bible.\" [William Cooper]: Remember, the Mystery Religion is a religion of the heavens. Also, in the Bible you will find many combinations of the number seven. In the Mystery Religion, that represents the seven stars of the Pleiades. And you can see the emergence of the Mystery Religion in the UFO movement, when the Pleiadians come to talk to Billy Myers in Switzerland. (laughs) Oh my, how we are deceived by these people! \"[Here are a few examples of the use of the number 12 in the Bible]: the 12 Months of the Year, the 12 Apostles of the Sun , the 12 Tribes of Israel, the 12 Brothers of Joseph, the 12 Judges of Israel, the 12 Great Patriarchs, the 12 [Old Testament] Prophets, the 12 Kings of Israel, the 12 Princes of Israel, God's Sun in Temple at 12 [and there are many more.] \"All of these examples and countless more derived directly from the ancient world's fascination with the 12 Signs of the Zodiac .\" [William Cooper]: Now remember, folks, what I'm given you is the teachings of the Mystery Schools. This does not necessarily reflect any of my own beliefs, or my own religious beliefs, or those of WWCR. We cannot fight against these manipulators unless we know who they are and what they believe. Now, what you want to believe is your own business. \"As we noted before [folks], the year was divided into 12 equal parts, or months. And to each month was appointed a heavenly symbol or astrological 'SIGN.' [William Cooper: Each of these signs made up one season in the world of the heavens, thus divided into four separate seasons.] Each of the 12 monthly signs were called 'HOUSES' OF THE HEAVENLY ZODIAC... \"...The astronomers of Babylon divided the sky into twelve 'houses.' [William Cooper: They did this to account for the fact that the planets were not always exactly in the ecliptic, but appeared to wander a certain number of degrees either side of it.] They [therefore had to assume that] each sign of the Zodiac extended its influence through a fixed [portion] of the sky, which they thought of as a house [William Cooper: to which a planet could return when it completed one of its journeys about the sun]...The great god of the day had its house in Leo [William Cooper: Leo, the Lion of Judah], where he ruled at the head of his splendor; the Moon ruled in Cancer, at the right hand of the Sun...The other planets were given two houses. One for day and one for night. And since the Zodiac divided the sky into twelve equal [portions], each of these houses was also equal, comprising 30°, [or] one ‐ twelfth of the 360° circle. \"[And] THE HOUSES/SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC were as follows: Aries was THE RAM or LAMB of God. Taurus THE BULL/GOLDEN CALF, Gemini THE TWINS [which represented] Cain ‐ Abel, Jacob ‐ Esau [or] Jesus ‐ Satan [William Cooper: for in Mystery Babylon, Jesus and Satan are brothers, and in some sects of the mystery religion, they are the same entity], Cancer THE CRAB, Leo THE LION/of the tribe of Judah [that can be found in Revelations 5, verse 5], Virgo the VIRGIN/spring birth of God's Sun...\" [William Cooper]: or Mary. Mary or Marie means pure, thus Mary the virgin, the mother of God, when God is reborn or born in the spring. And that is where the mother holding the child, Isis with the child, Horus, and all through the history of the world you will find a virgin holding a child in every culture, every language, in every continent, of this Earth. \"...Libra THE SCALES, Scorpio THE SCORPIAN, the back ‐ biting traitor...Judas, Sagittarius THE ARCHER, Capricorn THE SEA ‐ GOAT [or the goat of Mendes]. Aquarius, MAN WITH THE WATER PITCHER, Pisces THE TWO FISH.\" [William Cooper]: The age that we are leaving at this point in time, is the age of Pisces. And, according to the Mystery Religion, we are entering into the Age of Aquarius very soon in our future. And to them this has great meaning, for it means the dawn of the New Age, the age of the illumined man. The number of the man is 666 in the Mystery Religion. \"Today we have expressions when someone dies. We say things like, 'They passed' or 'They Passed On' or 'They Passed Away.' The ancients said 'They Passed Over ' (from one life to another). [William Cooper: Over what? Over the river.] And so it was with the coming of spring, as God's Sun is 'Resurrected' from the Death of Winter to His New Life (in spring ). This is why Christians celebrate 'The Resurrection' with a Sun ‐ Rise service at...'EASTER'...and the Jews, who knew [William Cooper: this ancient religion from their time in captivity in Babylon] celebrate the same with their...'PASSOVER.' 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"With this knowledge, we now add the fact that the first [Decan] of the astrological sign of Virgo is 'Coma' ‐ or the 'desired one' ‐ of the nations. This was pictured by the ancient astrologers as a virgin girl holding a new born babe. Hence, our 'Madonna and Child' motif, so in the spring, or Virgo , God's Sun is ' Born of a Virgin .' Incidentally, the astrological symbol for Virgo is the letter 'M' [or] 'Marie' [which] means 'pure', hence 'M' ‐ ary...the pure virgin!\" [William Cooper]: And all through every culture, you will sign...find other representations by other names of the virgin mother with the child. Isis with the child Horus, born of a magical intercourse, when Isis changes into a bird and flutters over the dead Osiris. Osiris representing the sun, Isis representing the moon. I will tell you the meaning of the child Horus, other than the Sun in the morning, probably on another episode of the Hour of the Time. Now, we belong to one another, according to the Mystery School. We are part of God's creation. We are part of a great fraternity of man, according to them. We are creations voiced to sing praises to God as we gather in the morning, (laughs) the morning, folks, to pray. The very time of day recalls our creation and our new creation in Christ during the gathering time reflect on this mystery [sic]. Using the silence, the sounds of morning, the Psalms and other scriptures, be aware that the rising sun is the image of Christ, our sun and source of life, and that is taken right out of a Protestant church's leaflet calling for the congregation to gather for the Easter sunrise service. \"Next, we read at I Peter [chapter 5 verse 4] that God's Sun is the 'Chief' shepherd. This word 'chief is very important. For at I Peter [chapter 2 verse 6] and again at [Ephesians chapter 2 verse 20] God's Sun is called the 'Chief Cornerstone' . \"[William Cooper: Now in our research in the mystery schools we find that the] word in Greek for 'Chief Cornerstone' simply meant the 'Peak of a Pyramid' . [The 'Peak of a Pyramid.] [The] corner foundation (stone) or, peak of the pyramid. \"The prefix akro ‐ [or] (topmost) was added by the Jews to the already existing Greek adjective, goniaios [or] (at the corner). In that way the translators of Isaiah rendered the Hebrew word for 'corner' (pinna Isaiah 28:14), describing the stone which was a 'sure foundation' and which probably had reference to the future Messiah...well understood by the Christian writers, was that of an important Stone which was both akro ‐ (a Peak) and a goniaios (a cornerstone). But there are four or more corners to a building, and a stone and a corner cannot be uniquely significant.\" [William Cooper]: Although you will find in Freemasonry the ceremony of laying a cornerstone for every building that is built, and you look at all the buildings in Washington, DC. You will see a cornerstone with the Masonic symbols and Masonic date of the Mystery Schools of the calendar of six thousand years. \"[Well, we found that we don’t believe that it can be] significant unless the stone be at the apex[, apex,] of a pyramid where all corners meet and bond together.\" [William Cooper]: ...and that is the secret of the truncated pyramid missing the cap stone, on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. For we have found in our research, that in the Mystery Religion the Master Mason is the cornerstone, or the peak, of the pyramid. The illumined man who functions as the eye of Horus, or the spy for the Mystery Schools, wherever he is at. \"Just as the great pyramid near Mexico City is called...the ' Pyramid of The Sun ,' so also The Great Pyramid of Egypt was [actually] dedicated to Horus, ' The Sun .' A picture of this you may see on the back of any one ‐ dollar bill. Above the pyramid [folks] is The Eye, the Sun ‐ The Eye of Horus, The Sun (of God). \"The New Testament tells us three different times that God's Sun was taught by and learned all things from the Father. He was...the PUPIL . \"We are told at Matthew [chapter 14 versus 17 and 19] that God's Sun tends to His people's needs with 'Two Fishes'. The two fishes being the astrological sign all astrologers know as Pisces . \"Thus, we have had for almost 2000 years God's Sun ruling in His 'kingdom' or sign of Pisces/Two Fishes. As stated before, these signs are called houses. Therefore, Pisces is the 'Lord's House' at this time. Truly, the Greatest 'Fish' Story Ever Told! \"According to astrology, sometime after the year 2010...\" [William Cooper]: Catch that date, folks: the year 2010 and remember when I told you about 2001 . Arthur C. Clark is obviously a member of the Mystery Schools, and Stanley Kubrick, who's responsible for making the movie, is obviously a member also. \"According to astrology, sometime after the year 2010 the Sun will enter into His new Sign , or His new Kingdom , as it was called by the ancients. This next coming Sign [or] Kingdom, soon to be upon us, will be, according to the Zodiac, the House or Sign of Aquarius . So when we read at Luke [chapter 22 verse 10], we now understand why God's Sun states that He and His followers, at the last Passover, 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"are to go into 'the house of the man with the water pitcher'. So we see in the coming millennium , God's Sun will bring us into His new Kingdom or House of Aquarius (the man with the water pitcher). \"Once we realize that in Astrology, each month is assigned one of the so ‐ called 'Houses' of the Zodiac and in heaven are 12 houses [or] (12 monthly signs), then the words we read of God's Sun saying 'In my Father's house are many mansions', makes sense (when translated correctly). The proper translation is as follows: Father's House = Heavenly Abode, Mansions = Houses. \"So, correctly read in the original text, we read: 'In my father’s heavenly abode are many houses.' Yes, 12 to be exact [according to the Mystery Religion of Babylon]! \"...[By careful intention and study of the houses,] you will be enable to interpret Horoscopes. [It is well to] remember [that] just as the influence of one Planet in one Sign may be affected for good or ill by another Planet in another Sign, so the influence of Planets in Signs in general may be [strengthened, weakened, enhanced, afflicted or otherwise altered] by the influence of Planets and houses [according to their beliefs]. \"...[A rule of thumb to remember is that] signs measure your inherent qualities, the Planets influence those qualities, and the Houses indicate directions for them. In other words, the Houses indicate certain things, and a Planet in a House influences or activates the things indicated.\" [William Cooper]: Now, this is all according to their religion. If you want more explanation, please ask Nancy Reagan. \"Anyone familiar with modern ‐ day Christianity must surely know we are said to be living in the 'Last Days'. This teaching is, in part, based on the idea expressed in Matthew [chapter 28, verse 20] of The King James Bible. Where God's Sun says, “I will be with you even to the End of the world.” End of the world??!! [In] another simple mistranslation to clarify [William Cooper: and there are many in the Bible] with a proper understanding of the actual words used. This 'end of the world' is translated differently in the various Bibles. Some say 'End of Time', [some say] 'End of the Days', and still others say 'Conclusion of this system of things.' So what does all this talk of the 'End Times/End of Days' really mean? \"[Well] here is the simple answer [folks, according to the Mystery Schools]. When the scripture speaks of 'the end of the world,' the actual word used is not , I repeat, is not end of the world . The actual word in Greek is 'Aeon, which, when correctly translated, means 'Age,' that’s spelled [folks] A ‐ G ‐ E ! Any library will have Bible concordances. Strong’s Bible Concordance is a good reference work to use here. Look up the word 'age' in any secular dictionary or Bible Concordance. There you will find the word for 'age' is from the Greek 'Aeon' [or A ‐ E ‐ O ‐ N]. Remembering that in Astrology each of the 12 houses (or signs) of the Zodiac corresponds to a 2000 year period of time, called an 'age,' we now know we are 1992 years into the House or Age of Pisces. Now, correctly understood, it can rightly be said that we today, in fact, are living in the 'LAST DAYS.' \"Yes, [according to the Mystery Schools] we are in the last days of the old 'Age of Pisces '. Soon, God's Sun will come again into His New Kingdom or 'New Age' [William Cooper: and that is where all this new ‐ age movement and new age comes from...'New Age'] of Aquarius (man with the water pitcher – Luke [chapter 22 verse 10]).\" [William Cooper]: That’s right, folks, the new Aeon or the New Age. This, according to the Mystery Schools, is the perversion of Christianity. This is the theme of the Bible, God's Sun in his coming kingdom age, the new age of Aquarius. Now, what you choose to believe is your business. Remember, don’t get mad at me. I am teaching you the Mystery Religion of ancient Babylon, and I am telling you right now many people practice this mystery religion in secret, and they hate Christians. They hate Christians because they believe that Christianity is a perversion of their religion, and thus is their enemy. \"When viewing the shimmering rays of sunlight on a body of water at dawn or sunset, [according to the Mystery Schools] one can still see today, how God's Sun 'walks on water.'\" [William Cooper]: Good night, and God bless you all.

(opening music: unknown orchestral piece) [reading from That Old ‐ Time Religion , by Jordan Maxwell]: \"The Sun enters each heavenly Sign or House of the Zodiac in what is called the 30th degree and leaves at the 33rd degree. Thus, God's Sun is said by the ancients to begin his ministry at 30 and dies at 33. [William Cooper: A Freemason is not told the truth of the object of his worship until he attains the 30th degree, and] This is why the highest degree in Freemasonry is the 33rd [degree] – for no one can rise higher than the Sun! \"When viewing the shimmering rays of sunlight on a body of water at dawn or sunset, one can still see today how God's Sun 'walks on water.' \"It was well understood by ancient man that our weather was caused and controlled by the Sun. It was a simple fact that God's Sun had the power to control storms at will. The ancient Egyptians taught that He did this as He rested in His heavenly boat while crossing the sky. Thus, we read that God's Sun quieted the tempest, or great storm on the sea, while in His boat. [William Cooper: Which boat? The boat of Isis.] \"Ra, the sun ‐ god, [also known as Osiris,] in the Barque of Millions of Years in which he transversed the heavens. He wears on his head, and accompanies, a vast sun ‐ disk symbolizing his powers as lord of the heavens. The boat, formed of a serpent, bears his Eye; and the god is seated on a pedestal representing Mayet, the divine order. \"[Folks,] when we stop to realize that every single king, prince, lord, governor, dictator, despotic ruler, civil and social institution, national flag, coat of arms, educational institution, military medal, award, organizational insignia, medallion, badge, emblem, citation, trophy, banner, pendant, political standard or ensign, agency of government or religion, uses the Sun as a primary symbol , then it can truly be said [in the Mystery School] that God's Sun is...'King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.' \"Here we note another cleverly disguised part of the whole, [according to the Mystery School] misunderstood [and plagiarized] story.\" 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: For they believe that Christianity is a perversion of the mysteries and that’s why they hate Christians. \"In the ancient world, months were counted according to the phases of the moon. They were called the 'lunar months' on the 'lunar calendar.' [Now,] since Scorpio/the Scorpion is the astrological sign starting in late October, the first month of autumn, it follows that October/the Scorpion , with his deadly, back ‐ biting 'tale', betrays the Sun in autumn, leading directly to His death in winter!\" [William Cooper]: ...and is known as Judas, and that’s where the October surprise comes from, and I’m telling you right now that Barbara Honegger was a plant. \"And the 30 pieces of silver were, as the North American Indians would say, 30 moons of silver needed for the month to 'betray ' the Sun and cause His unhappy death! \"In relation to this, another interesting point: Factually speaking, when a person is bitten by a deadly scorpion the wound appears to be, or looks like , two human lips. The ancients called this 'The Kiss of Death! ' This is why we read that Judas [or] (October) gives God's Sun 'the kiss ' – leading to His death in winter!\" [William Cooper]: ...and that is the original October surprise. There was an October surprise in France on Friday, October the 13th in the year 1307. Look it up, but in case you don’t, I will cover it extensively later. \"The next point to be made requires first, a little background. Christians have always referred to God as 'The Father.' But viewing God as a father didn't start here – it goes back far into the ancient world. The reason is: [according to the Mystery Religion] Our planet was always viewed as our 'Mother Earth or Mother Nature.'\" [William Cooper]: ...and that's where all of this Mother Earth and Earth Goddess comes from in the New Age movement. \"And since rain (the life ‐ bringing fluid [William Cooper: or the semen]), falling from heaven, impregnated and brought life to Mother Earth, it was therefore believed that our Father was in Heaven. \"All this life ‐ bringing intercourse between God the Father and Mother Earth would be after a proper marriage ceremony at a spring wedding. In the area today called Israel, anciently called 'The Land of Canaan,' the (sexual/fertility) rites of spring were celebrated each year in what was called...'The Marriage Feast of Canaan .' \"And so the New Testament story was...Mother Earth asked God's Sun to draw water (from the sea) for the grapes to make fine wine for the wedding feast. [And] this marriage feast story is over 5000 years old – 3000 years before the New Testament story...[And the mystery schools believe it is] Just one more case of pious plagiarism. \"[Now] it is at this point we need to go back to the ancient Egyptians to further understand [this story]. Though all of the essential pieces of the Christian story were long in existence before Egypt, [William Cooper: the only thing different, folks, is the names were changed to protect the innocent,] it was with the coming of the Pharaohs that the story was finally codified and became religious dogma. Though the story varied in some details from place to place in Egypt, the essence was always the same: God's Sun [spelled S ‐ U ‐ N]/our risen Savior was the 'Light of the World,' who gave His life for us.\" [William Cooper]: Now remember, this is according to the belief of the Mystery Religion of Babylon. \"From the Egyptian records we learn that the new born Sun, Horus, was given the title 'The Logos,' which means 'The Word.' Egyptians further said 'The Word' was made flesh and dwelt among us. And since we enjoy only one Sun in heaven, He was said to be ' The Only Begotten ' (of the Father).\" [William Cooper]: The word was lost and that story is told in the Osirian cycle of Isis, Osiris and the child Horus, and you will learn that the symbol of the word today is the obelisk, the monolith, the stone. It is also called the Lost Word of Freemasonry, and I will explain the meaning of all of those things later. \"Another interesting point not to be missed concerning Horus: Later in Egyptian history He was given a second name – Iesos , or Iesus , meaning 'holder of the light.' Still later, in Roman Latin, 'I' became interchangeable with 'J.' So from Iesus , we get Jesus. \"All of this can be read by anyone in a public library!! [William Cooper: If you so desire.] \"In ancient Egypt it was said that if you wanted to follow the life of God's Sun and thereby 'live in the light of God's Word' [or] (Logos), one would first have to leave his old ways of life to 'Follow the Sun [faced to the east].' But before beginning this new life in 'The Word,' 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"one must die to the old way of life and be 'BORN AGAIN.'\" [William Cooper]: George Bush, when asked at a press conference by a reporter if he was a Christian, Mr. Bush said this: \"If you’re asking if I have been born again, the answer is yes.\" \"Your first birth was 'out of the water' your mother formed you in. Because her water broke and your new life began, rebirth is symbolized by coming out of total immersion in water ‐‐ [or] baptism ‐‐ or being born again. \"These points here mentioned are just some of hundreds, if not thousands, of direct connections that can be made between the Judaic ‐ Christian Bible Story and the far more ancient, original Story. [The] purpose for drawing your attention to this literary plagiarism [William Cooper: according to the Mystery School; this is what they believe,] is best stated by Alfred North Whitehead who said, 'No lie can live forever.'\" [William Cooper]: They hate Christians; they hate Christianity, and the first object is to destroy the Christian church and Christians, to wipe them off the face of the earth. If you are a Christian, you are in the greatest danger that you can even imagine at this moment as the New World Order takes shape around you. \"...Egyptologist Gerald Massey [said], 'They must find it difficult, those who have taken authority as the truth, rather than truth as the authority.' \"[And now] for a few thoughts on the 'Old Testament' Word of God...\" [William Cooper]: ...according again to the Mystery Religion. Remember, I am revealing the secrets of the Mystery Religion of Babylon during this broadcast. \"At Malachi 4:2 the God of Heaven is described as the 'SUN of Righteousness with healing in His wings [William Cooper: and it is spelled S ‐ U ‐ N]. The Sun with healing in His wings ?? [Then in] the New Testament at [Matthew] 23:37 and Luke 13:34 we see God's Sun wanting to gather all under 'His wings .' This is most appropriate for, in Egypt, the Sun was always pictured with His wings .\" [William Cooper]: ...and you see a disk with wings. Now, all these pitiful little twits running around calling themselves ufologists and Zecharia Sitchin, who has perverted the interpretation of the ancient writings, claims that this means that the Egyptians – whenever they drew these, or put these hieroglyphics in their writings – were indicating that UFOs came from other planets, and nothing could be farther from the truth. But this is part of the Mystery Babylon deception trying to convince the people of the earth that we are threatened by some other species from some other planet so that they can more quickly bring about their New World Order, their one ‐ world totalitarian socialist government. Don't fall for it, folks. I have found that most of these people involved with the so ‐ called \"UFO research,\" who are trying to convince you of this, are Freemasons. Most of them, 32nd degree of the Scottish Rite. And evidently they are attempting to do their best toward the furtherance of the Great Work in order to attain the 33rd degree, which can only be attained by meritorious work to bring about the completion of the Great Work, which is the destruction of the church, the state and the enslavement of the mob, which is all of us. I hope you hear me out there. \"In the most ancient Egyptian understanding of things, mankind was called 'the sheep of God.' And the great Orb of Day, God's Sun, was the overseer or, in the exact words from the ancient Egyptian manuscript, ' The Good Shepherd ' – and we are His flock . All ancient kings thought of their people as sheep to be pastured, with themselves as 'the shepherd.' Sheep are ideal followers, you see, for they do not think for themselves but will blindly follow anyone without question [William Cooper: and that is why I call most people 'sheeple']. [It's truly] admirable behavior for animals, but [it is very, very] unwise for humans. Sheep were born to be fleeced , and have 'the wool pulled over their eyes.'\" [William Cooper]: ...and are eventually always led to the slaughter.] Lastly, they end up as a tasty meal, eaten by their masters [William Cooper: and their skin, or their hide or their wool, is worn as an apron around a Freemason’s waist. (laughs) How about that? \"[Keep] all of the foregoing in mind, [folks,] we read again from the Old Testament Book of Psalms . At Psalms 23:4 we read that old, dog ‐ eared, tired exhausted and equally misunderstood chestnut [according to the Mystery Schools], used by every 'man of the cloth' to put the sheep to sleep, we quote it here: 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy Rod and thy Staff , they comfort me.' 'Thy Rod and thy Staff '!!?? \"Here in the Book of Psalms the Old Testament God is pictured with His... Rod and Staff . \"The rod here mentioned is the king's 'Rod of Discipline.' And the staff is the 'Shepherd's Staff,' or crook. Now for the correct understanding of this old verse. Any good library book on the Egyptian religion will tell you that the ancient Pharaohs were said to be 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ruling for God's Sun [spelled S ‐ U ‐ N] on Earth. He was called 'King of the Kingdom' and 'The Great Shepherd of His Sheep.' In the hands of the Pharaoh/God (who's arms form the 'sign of the cross' on his chest), were placed the royal symbols of heavenly power...the Rod [William Cooper: which was a flail] and [the] Staff .\" [William Cooper]: The rod was used to beat those who were disobedient and the staff, with the crook, was used to herd the sheep. \"Incidentally, Jesus is pictured not only with His shepherd's staff but, at [Revelation] 12:5 & [Revelation] 19:15, is also said to...'rule with a rod of iron.'\" [William Cooper]: And I have pictures here of all of this. You can’t see it, but you can go to the library and find this stuff. Our research has been thorough and we have managed to place members of CAJI within the Masonic lodges and we have verified everything that we are telling you now. We have infiltrated the lodge. \"In [Jeremiah] 18:2 ‐ 6 and [Isaiah] 64:8 we see the God of the Old Testament portrayed in a different way. Here He is said to be The ' Great Potter ' who fashions man on a potter's wheel . All Mighty God...The Great Potter ??\" [William Cooper]: In Jeremiah 18, let me read to you what it says: \"The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 'Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.' Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.\" [William Cooper]: In Isaiah 64: \"But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.\" The potter story was Egyptian, 1000 years before it was written by the writers of the Bible, and I have a picture here taken from Egyptian hieroglyphics, and you can find this in a book called, The African Belief in God . It shows the hieroglyphics taken right of the Egyptian temples and it shows the god Khnemu fashioning the body of one of Ptolemies on his potter's wheel. And here is another picture: the god Khnemu fashioning a Man upon a \"Potter's Table,\" [and] behind him stands Thoth marking his Span of Life [on a staff]. \"In Egypt, God's Risen Sun was Horus. At 12 noon he became the 'Most High.' In this exalted position, He became the mediator between God and man. His name was Amen ‐ Ra. Ra = ray (of the sun). His shepherds on Earth were called 'Priests of Amen.' They would direct their prayers to the invisible God – The Father – through His mediator, Amen ‐ Ra. [And] God's Sun was 'The Great Amen' with His Rays. In the New Testament He – The Sun – is still called (at 2 [Corinthians] 1:20 & [Revelation] 1:7 & [Revelations] 3:14) ' THE AMEN. ' At the end of prayers in the temples of Egypt they would say 'Amen.'\" [William Cooper]: How does that grab you? Now look at the word Israel. I ‐ S (Isis), R ‐ A (Ra), EL (God). It is the androgynous God, and it’s been in front of your eyes all the time...all the time, folks. Anyone who goes to any library and does the research that we have done can reveal that the religion of Mystery Babylon is exactly as I have stated it last Friday night and during this broadcast, and will continue to state it because there is a lot more, folks. We have, in fact, not even yet begun, for this is only the ancient portion, the beginning of the ancient worship of Baal. Or ' Bay ‐ yel ' as some pronounce it. Ba was the Sun, al means God. [William Cooper]: And that was the beginning of the end of our civilization as we know it if we do not wake up now. I firmly believe and I live my life according to this: that I owe my first allegiance to my God and Jesus Christ, my second allegiance I owe to the Constitution of the United States of America and my third allegiance to my family. And the reason my allegiance is in that order is because God endowed man with unalienable rights. The Constitution protects those rights, and the family is thus able to survive and be protected and thrive. And the family is the basic unit of civilization, period. And I further believe that any man or woman without principles that they are ready and willing to die for at any given moment that they are called upon to do it, are already dead and are of no use or consequence to anyone ‐‐ not even themselves. Understand what I just said. I have to take a short break, folks. Don’t go away. I’ll be right back after this short pause.

The use to which magic should be put is revealed in the Osirian cycle where Isis applies the most potent of her charms and invocations to accomplish the resurrection of Osiris. In other words, the redemption of the human soul. That the gods of Egypt were elements of a profound magical system and possessed a significance far 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"different from that advanced by modern Egyptologists is certain. The various deities of the Nile valley were elements of an elaborate magical metaphysical system, a kind of ceremonial Cabbala. This cannot be denied. But even when impressed with the reality of this fact, the modern Egyptologist still balks. “Supposing,” he asks, “that the Egyptians did possess an elaborate metaphysical doctrine? Of what value is its rediscovery in an age when the natural has been demonstrated to be mediocre and the supernatural non ‐ existent? Even if these extinct persons whose mummies clutter up our museums were the custodians of some mysterious lore, we have simply out grown it. Let the dead pass bury its dead [William Cooper: they say]. We prefer to live in an era of enlightenment, an enlightenment which you would blight by asking us to espouse the superstitions of our remote ancestors. \"These so ‐ called superstitions, however, it is interesting to note, die hard. In fact they do not die at all, but insinuate themselves as a discordant note in our matter ‐ of ‐ fact existences. McCall’s magazine published some time ago an article by Edgar Wallace entitled The Curse of Amen ‐ Ra , dealing with the phenomena attendant upon the opening of the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamen. After vividly describing the curse of Amen ‐ Ra the author sums up the effect of this curse upon those who came in contact with the tomb or its contents. His statements are in substance as follows: At the time the tomb was opened the party present at the excavations included the Earl of Carnarvon, Howard Carter and his secretary, Dick Bethel, M. Benedite the French archaeologist, and M. Pasanova. Of these, only one, Howard Carter, remains alive. [William Cooper: Now, that was at the time of the article.] Colonel Aubrey Herbert, Carnarvon's half ‐ brother, and Evelyn ‐ White who also entered the tomb were both dead within a year, one by suicide. Sir Archibald Douglas Reed, the radiologist who took an X ‐ Ray of the mummy, was also dead within twelve months; and Professor Laffleur of McGill university, the first American scientist to examine the death chamber, did not leave Luxor alive. Woolf Joel visited the tomb and was dead within a year. Jay Gould was taken ill within the tomb and died. Attendants whose duty it was to look after the exhibit from the tomb in Cairo Museum also sickened and died. Seven French authors and journalists visited the tomb and six were dead within two years. When they unveiled Tutankhamen they found a mark upon his face, and by a strange coincidence (?) the mark left upon the face of Lord Carnarvon, which presumably caused his death, was in exactly the same spot and of similar appearance. Nor does this list include the numerous native workmen who perished from the curse. Only recently another name was added to the long list associated with the tragedy. Arthur Weigall, after a long and mysterious illness similar to that defined in the curse, is the most recent victim. The eminent authority on antiquities, Dr. Mardus, said, 'The Egyptians for seven thousand years possessed the secret of surrounding their mummies with some dynamic force of which we have only the faintest idea.' \"Over the entrance to the tomb of Tutankhamen was a magical tablet inscribed with strange hieroglyphics. Dr. Mardus named this tablet the 'Stela of Malediction,' for it pronounced a fearful curse upon any sacrilegious person who might violate the sanctuary of the deified head [William Cooper: and it was called the stele]. The words upon the stela were as follows: 'Oh ye Beings from Above, Oh ye Beings from Below! Phantoms riding the breasts of men, ye of the crossroads and of the great highways, wanderers beneath the shade of night! And ye from the Abysses of the West, on the fringes of the Twilight, dwellers in the caverns of obscurity, who rouse terrors and shuddering: and ye, walkers by night whom I will not name, friends of the Moon; and ye intangible inhabitants of the world of night, Oh People, Oh Denizens of the Tombs, all of you approach and be my witnesses and my respondents! Let the hand raised against my form be withered! Let them be destroyed who attack my name, my foundation, my effigies, the images like unto me.' \"Can modern Egyptologists and scientists and all branches and departments view likely the culture of the Egyptians if their researches into the forces of nature gave them such strange power and enabled them to master natural laws of which modern learning has no knowledge or conception?\" [William Cooper]: Did you know that Lars Hansen was reared in The Stelle Group? Did you know that a very famous talk show host who covers for the Masons all the time was a member? Also was heavily involved with the Communist party? Did you know these things? Do you ever bother to check, you who listen to these people and believe them blindly, you, the sheeple of the world? \"Circumstances so extraordinary is the curse of King Tutankhamen simply overtax the theory of mere coincidence [folks]. Nor is this an isolated case as those will remember who read the accounts of the Cleopatra mummy curse many years ago. It will also be noted that in this age of moral certitudes the story of the Tutankhamen curse had no sooner been broadcast than several of our large museums were deluged by gifts of Egyptian antiquities from private individuals who no longer desired to own them. And these, persons most of them well educated (as modern education goes), were not superstitious ‐‐ they were just careful. \"The following article appeared in an English newspaper in 1923: 'The death of Lord Carnarvon has been followed by a panic among collectors of Egyptian antiquities. All over the country people are sending their treasures to the British Museum, anxious to get rid of them because of the superstition that Lord Carnarvon was killed by the 'ka' or double of the soul of Tutankhamen. These fears are, it is hardly necessary to state, absolutely groundless.' \"It’s also hardly necessary [folks] to add that the journalist fails to give his authority for the last sentence. The newspaper article continues: \"'An avalanche of parcels containing mummies' shriveled hands and feet, porcelain and wooden statuettes and other relics of the 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ancient tombs descended this week on the British Museum. Fear inspires these gifts, brought by every post. The belief that a dead king's curse is potent for evil after thousands of years won thousands of adherents on the day when Lord Carnarvon became ill. *** Few of the parcels received at the museum bear the sender's name. The owners, in their eagerness to wash their hands of the accursed things, have tried to keep their identity secret. *** The British Museum is a godsend to the superstitious. It offers a means of shifting the liability to expert shoulders. The museum authorities are used to such liabilities, having harbored the coffin lid of the powerful priestess of Amen ‐ Ra for years, but they are not at all grateful for the present flood of gifts. The museum weathered a similar storm some years ago when the story of the curse of the priestess of Amen ‐ Ra became public. Sufficient scare gifts were received to fill a large showcase. A long chain of fatalities has been attributed to the curse of the priestess. Men who have made fun of the superstitious have died within the year. Another story is that a photographer took pictures of the priestess and placed the plates in his safe. When he went to look at them some weeks later, the glass had become a thin brown powder.' \"[Now,] let us consider the 'rational' explanations, so ‐ called, adduced by science in disposing of the superstition of the king's curse. Dr. Frederick H. Cowles, F.R.G.S., famous British scientist, declared in an interview...years ago that Lord Carnarvon and a number of workmen engaged in excavation met their deaths as the result of a poisonous and almost invisible dust placed there purposely by the wily priests to bring destruction upon the violators of the dead. 'This poisonous dust,' says Doctor Cowles, 'analysis of which has baffled scientists, was scattered about the tomb. *** Lord Carnarvon was not the only to note its fatal property, as a number of workmen engaged in the excavation were likewise stricken. Most of these died a lingering death, but others, greatly impaired in health have recovered.' There is nothing in the learned doctor’s explanation, however, to account for the fact that Howard Carter did not chance to breathe any of the noxious vapors, although he was more steadily engaged in the work of excavation then even Lord Carnarvon. [It’s also questioned] how much science actually knows about this mysterious dust which defies analysis, for if it cannot be analyzed how can it be either identified with certainty or even proved poisonous. The term 'poisonous dust' is evidently the charitable term that covers a multitude of scientific shortcomings.\" [William Cooper]: Several years later there was another revelation: that they were stricken with some virus that inhabits ancient tombs, and who knows what the real story is. \"Though sorcery has been accorded no official recognition by modern science, there is, nevertheless, a certain quasi ‐ official acceptance of the reality of occult phenomena through out the civilized world. In a newspaper interview Sir Arthur Conan ‐ Doyle illustrates the wide ‐ spread recognition of the idea that the Egyptians knew how to surround their dead with mysterious guardian agencies which throughout the centuries visited their vengeance upon grave ‐ robbers, scientific or otherwise. In discussing with the correspondent of the Daily Express the death of a certain Mr. Fletcher who had felt the wrath of Egypt’s dead, Conan ‐ Doyle declared that the tragedy was caused by Egyptian 'elementals' guarding a female mummy because another student of Egyptology, a Mr. Robinson, had begun an investigation of the stories of the mummy's malevolence. 'I warned Mr. Robinson,' he says, 'against concerning himself with the mummy at the British Museum, he persisted, and his death followed.'\" [William Cooper]: You may wonder where all this is going, but it becomes clear when you understand that the Egyptians inherited the religion of Babylon. \"[So] are we to presume...that the single phase of ceremonial magic constituted the entire repertoire of Egyptian thaumaturgists. [You see,] if they could manifest such surprising power, is it not probable that they possessed a knowledge of natural hidden forces ‐‐ forces as yet unknown to the modern public world which is possibly of inestimable value?\" [William Cooper]: Which may still be contained within what is called the Secrets of the Ages? Which is guarded by the modern Mystery School? Which is still the ancient Mystery School brought forward through the ages? \"We are assured in the 'authorized version' [William Cooper: and note, I say 'authorized version'] of Holy Writ that the magicians of Egypt changed their staves or rods into serpents in the presence of Pharaoh. The modern scientist does not live who can duplicate that phenomenon, yet if he happens to be a good Christian he is in somewhat of a dilemma... \"...We [can] pass over all the desperate efforts to disprove the magical powers of the Egyptians as arising, not from a mature knowledge, but from a desperate prejudice. [You see,] magic is too ancient and too universal to be explained away by mirrors, wires and hinges. In Egypt we are dealing unquestionably with true manifestations of occult power. The learned author of Art Magic presents what maybe accepted as a reasonable accurate estimation of the priest ‐ magicians of the old Egyptian Mysteries. 'They were highly educated, scientific men. They understood the nature of the lodestone, the virtues of mineral and animal magnetism, which, together with the force of psychological impression, constituted a large portion of their theurgic practices. They perfectly understood the art of reading the inner most secrets of the soul, of impressing the susceptible imagination by enchantment and fascination, of sending their own spirits forth from their body which many modern metaphysical teachers claim that they can do, as clairvoyance, under the action of powerful will ‐‐ in fact, they were masters of the art now known as mesmerism, clairvoyance, electro ‐ biology, etc. They also realized the virtues of magnets, gums, herbs, drugs and fumigations, and employed music to admirable effect.'\" 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And no one since has been able to perfect and even come close to their art of embalming the dead. \"The highly gifted Egyptologist Lenormant acknowledges Egyptian magic as an essential part of their religious philosophy. James Bonwick, F.R.G.S., thus summarizes the powers possessed by Egyptian adepts: 'Egyptian mystics could levitate, walk the air, handle fire, live under water, sustain great pressure, harmlessly suffer mutilation, read the past, foretell the future, make themselves invisible and cure disease.'\" [William Cooper]: Now, I have no idea whether to believe that or not, but that is what this expert says. Now, if you doubt the power of magic wielded by the priests of Mystery Babylon listen to this, for we can compare James Bonwick’s account with some other news from Tibet, another land long famous for magic. \"...Dr. Alexander Cannon, a distinguished scientist, a Doctor of Medicine, a celebrated psychiatrist, a Master of Arts, and a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society, brought back a strange record from the land of the Lamas. He [claimed he] saw a tree withered by a pointed finger, a dead man raised to life, the Grand Lama surrounded by a blue aura three inches thick, and a human being lifted into the air by pure mental effort. The London County Council called upon Dr. Cannon to resign his post, as the head of a noted institution, for his remarks, but later, strangely enough, after further enquiry, withdrew the demand. It would seem [folks] that the age of miracles or at least magic is not dead.\" [William Cooper]: You know, Plato ‐‐ I wrote this in my book ‐‐ was an initiate of Mystery Babylon and was actually initiated in the Great Pyramid in Egypt where he lay in the sarcophagus for three days and three nights. He entered as a mortal man and, according to his writings, emerged as a god given, or imparted, knowledge which [with] he was to guard and keep. Remember, they called themselves the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages.\" \"From the writings of Proclus and Iamblichus we can gain a considerable insight into the principles of Egyptian magic. To the old philosophers, even Pythagoras and Plato, magic was no mystery. According to Proclus the initiated priests so fully understood the mutual sympathy between the visible and invisible worlds that they were able to change the course of action and focus divine virtues upon inferior natures. And according to Plato the highest form of magic consisted in the divine worship of the gods [William Cooper: plural], and according to Iamblichus the priests, through sacerdotal theurgy, were able to ascend from a material state of [unconsciousness (*note ‐ book says, 'consciousness')] to a realization of the universal essence, thus coming to an understanding of universal purpose by which the performance of high feats of magic became possible.\" [William Cooper]: Thousands of years later Aleister Crowley claimed the same thing. Now this is significant. \"[It’s] proper at this point to establish a clear line of demarcation of magic and sorcery. [You see,] the term magic was not associated with occult jugglery by the Egyptians but arose from a profound understanding of natural law... \"...[William Cooper: 'Magic,' said General Albert Pike, and you will be hearing an awful lot of General Albert Pike during this series of shows,] 'Magic,' says General Albert Pike, 'is the exact and absolute science of nature and its laws.' From the knowledge of this absolute science arises occult science. [William Cooper: Occult merely means \"hidden\", folks.] From experience in occult science in turn arises the theurgic art, for as surely as man has adapted his physical universe to his purposes so surely the adept of the Mystery School adapts the metaphysical universe to his purposes. To acknowledge that the Egyptians possessed the power of adapting mystical forces to physical ends is to bestow upon them proficiency in the most perfect and difficult of the arts [William Cooper: according to the Mystery Religion of Babylon]. Yet to deny this ability on the part of the Egyptian priests is to deny the evident, and we must resign ourselves to the undeniable fact that they possessed a form of learning which has not been conferred upon this present race...\" [William Cooper]: ...at least publicly. Men like Aleister Crowley have proven that it has been passed down through the ages and is kept and practiced secretly by those who call themselves the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages.\" [William Cooper asks for donations and advertises CAJI memberships] Good night, folks, and God bless you, and remember this is what can happen if you just wake up.

I'm your host, William Cooper. (Opening music: Fur Elise , played with electronic instruments) [Reading from Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians , by Manly Hall]: \"The fable of Isis and Osiris, as it has descended to us in the account given by Plutarch has not been greatly amplified by any modern research. The Egyptian fragments which have been translated in recent years offer no complete account of the birth, life, death and resurrection of Osiris, nor has any new key been found to unlock this great drama which may well be termed \"The Passion Play of Egypt.\" It is not our intention to perpetuate Plutarch's account merely for its outward appearance but rather, from the same motive that inspired Synesius, Platonic philosopher and Christian bishop, to compile his account of the same fabulous history. Synesius in his treatise On Providence [William Cooper: and you hear that word a lot in the Secret Societies, and especially in Freemasonry] thus introduces the Osirian myth: “'This fable is Egyptian. The Egyptians transcend in wisdom. Perhaps therefore this also been a fable, obscurely signifies something more than a fable, because it is Egyptian. If, however, it is not a fable, but a sacred discourse, it will deserve in a still greater degree to be told, and committed to writing.' \"In presenting a summary of Plutarch’s account [I am omitting] nothing which could in anyway be regarded as relevant. [I am taking] the liberty, however, of somewhat expanding the fable by incorporating therein some small fragments derived from other Greek writers and occasionally a few words bearing upon the account from fragments from Egyptian religious literature. The story then is in substance as follows: \"The goddess Nut, whom Plutarch identifies with Rhea, was the daughter of Shu and Tefnut. She is the wife of Seb [also known as Saturn] and the mother of Ra [or Helios, also known as the sun]. [Now] if we are to trust Plutarch, she afterwards becomes the wife of Ra, or the sun. Nut is unfaithful to Ra who, discovering that she is with child by Seb, pronounces a curse upon her that she should not be delivered of her progeny in any month or year . Thoth [which is] (Hermes or Mercury), who is also in love with Nut, comes to her assistance with a stratagem. He plays at tables with the moon ‐ goddess (Selene) and wins from her the seventieth part of each of her illuminations, and joining these parts together he forms of them five days which he adds to the calendar; previous to that time the Egyptian year consisted of three hundred and sixty days [William Cooper: the exact number of degrees in a circle]. [Now] these five days, being not part of any month or year, Ra was outwitted[, you see, because] upon these days Nut brought forth her five children at different times and different places. Upon the first of these days she brought forth Osiris and the place of his birth, according to Diodorus was Mount Nissa, in Arabia the Happy. (Mount Nysa is now Mount Sinai [folks].) At the moment of the birth of Osiris a voice sounded through out the world saying,'The Lord of all the earth is born.' On the second day Nut gave birth to Aroueris, the elder Horus; on the third day, Typhon or Set; on the fourth day, Isis; and on the fifth and last day, Nephthys. The Egyptians, therefore, regard the five days which they termed the Epact or super ‐ added, as the birthdays of the gods, especially venerating the fourth of them, upon which the benevolent goddess Isis came into being. \"Plutarch further on announces that the five children of Nut were not all of the same father, thus contradicting his earlier statement. [For] he says that Osiris and the elder Horus were the children of Ra, that Isis was the daughter of Thoth, and only Typhon and Nephthys were actually the offspring of Seb. There is another and even more recondite legend regarding the elder Horus which denies him the fathership of Ra, declaring him to be the offspring of Osiris and Isis while they were still in the womb of Nut. [Now] these accounts we shall consider later. \"Osiris was given to Pamyles to be educated, and having come to the years of majority, became the king of Egypt. In this high capacity Osiris applied himself to the civilizing of his nation, turning the Egyptians from their previously indigent and barbarous course of life to a 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"happy and community existence. He taught them agriculture, compiled for them a body of laws for the regulation of conduct, instructed them in the reverencing in worship of the gods, thus establishing Egypt in all the essentials of truth [William Cooper: according to the legend. Now] having brought his own nation to prosperity and enlightenment, Osiris traveled over the rest of the world, converting peoples to his discipline, not by force but through persuasion of reason. Osiris was accompanied on this journey by a procession of nymphs and other superphysical beings who filled the air with music and song. \"In the meantime Typhon, brother or half ‐ brother of Osiris, had ambition to usurp the throne, but the vigilant Isis, sister ‐ wife of Osiris, was too watchful. Typhon, however, having persuaded seventy ‐ two other persons to join him in his conspiracy, with the aid of a certain queen in Ethiopia named Aso, perfected a plot against Osiris. He fashioned a chest exactly to the [measurement] of the body of Osiris which chest he caused to be brought into the banquet hall where the princes of Egypt were feasting their king's return. Typhon, simulating jest, promised this elaborately ornamented box to the one whose body, upon trial, most nearly fitted it. [Now] each of the princes in turn lay down in the box, but each was too short or too tall, until last of all Osiris himself lay down in it. Immediately the seventy ‐ two conspirators rushed to the box, clamped the cover up on it, fastened it with nails and poured melted lead over all the cracks and crevices. After this they carried the chest to the bank of the Nile and cast it into the river where it joins the sea. [Now] this evil deed was executed upon the seventeenth day of the Egyptian month of Athyr when the sun was in Scorpio. According to some it was in the twenty ‐ eighth year of the reign of Osiris, and to others in the twenty ‐ eight year of his life.\" [William Cooper]: Now, try to remember these numbers if you can. Jot them down, but these numbers will prop up again and again and again. Scorpio crops up, seventeen crops up, twenty ‐ eight crops up and many other numbers. And they all have significance in the Mystery Religion of Babylon, the Secret Societies and to the Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages. \"As soon as Isis received word of this crime she cut off one of the locks of her hair and put on the mourning apparel of widowhood, for which reason the spot, where she did this, was afterwards called Coptos [William Cooper: that’s Coptos] or the city of mourning. After donning the widow's weeds, Isis set forth in search of her husband’s body and wandered about all [William Cooper: Europe... (laughs)...Europe...wandered about all] Egypt, asking all with whom she came in contact.\" [William Cooper]: You see, I may be back here in the United States but a lot of my thoughts, folks, are still in Europe. \"Finally some children, who had been play, told [Isis] that they’ve seen the accomplices of Typhon carrying the chest to the Nile; for that reason Egyptians regard the words of children as oracular and pay great attention to them. While Isis was searching for her husband's body she learned that Nephthys, her sister, had by magic insinuated herself into the presence of Osiris before his death and in the guise of Isis had conceived a son from him. [Now] Isis sought out the child which Nephthys had deserted for fear of Typhon’s anger, and adopting it, attached it to her person as a constant guard and attendant. This was Anubis, the dog ‐ headed god who appears in the Book of the Dead [William Cooper: and in many of the Egyptian hieroglyphics]. \"[After some time] Isis learned that the chest had been carried by the sea to the coast of Byblos [William Cooper: Now, Byblos is also the name for book or Bible ], where it had lodged in the branches of a bush of tamarisk which had grown up miraculously about the sacred receptacle and concealed it within its trunk.\" [William Cooper]: Now remember this tamarisk, and remember that it is a tree. \"The king of Byblos, amazed at the miracle, caused the tree to be cut down and from the trunk, containing the box, he made a pillar to support the roof of his palace. [Now] by magic Isis discovered this and, traveling immediately to Byblos, attached herself to the suite of the queen as a nurse to her children. At night, when all the palace was asleep, Isis transformed herself into a swallow and fluttered around the column, bemoaning her fate in strange, sad notes. In due time Isis revealed her divine nature and asked that the pillar be cut down; taking therefrom the chest, she departed with it into a desert place where she performed certain magical rites by which the body of Osiris was temporarily animated and by this animation she received from Osiris a son who was called the younger Horus, the child who was conceived of the dead. \"[Now] there is some confusion in the account at this point. Plutarch says that Isis left the body of Osiris temporarily to visit her son Horus, just mentioned, but the context of the fable would rather call for her departure to a secluded place where the child could be born without the knowledge of Typhon who certainly would have destroyed him. Isis hid the chest in a remote and unfrequented place but Typhon, hunting one night by the light of the moon, chanced upon it. Knowing its contents and realizing Isis to be proficient in magic, he resolved to thwart her purposes, and tearing the body in fourteen parts, he scattered them over Egypt.\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember \"fourteen parts,\" folks, don’t forget that. \"From the inscriptions on the Metternich Stele it seems that Set must have imprisoned Isis and her son Horus. The goddess is made to say, 'I am Isis, and I came forth from the house wherein my brother Set has placed me.' Thoth, the 'Prince of Law,' again came to her 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"assistance, and aided Isis to escape from the house...\" [William Cooper]: Was it really a prison, or was it really the House of Set? \"...Thoth, also, at this time, prophesied that Horus would set upon the throne of his father and rule the double empire of Egypt. Upon the advice of Thoth, Isis hides the child in a papyrus swamp, thus saving him from the wrath of Set. \"Isis, returning, having left her son at Butos, and fashioning a magical boat out of papyrus, traversed the whole of the empire. As she met with the scattered parts of her husband, she buried each one separately, first, however, encasing it in a magical mummy composed of wax, incense, and grain seed. She finally recovered all of the parts of Osiris except the phallus [William Cooper: or the penis] which had been thrown into the river and devoured by three fishes. This organ Isis reproduced in gold...\" [William Cooper]: Remember this also, remember the three fishes, for they represent ignorance, superstition, and fear. They also represent the church, the state, and the mob, and remember that Isis reproduced this member, this organ... \"...in gold and having performed all of the ceremonies necessary to insure the life of Osiris in the underworld, she returned to her son Horus and by the theurgic arts, of she was mistress, saved him from death from the stings of scorpions. \"Horus, having grown to man's estate, and having received from his mother the tradition of his father’s murder, longed to avenge the evil deed. Osiris appeared to his son in a vision, instructing him in the means by which he could overcome the hosts of Typhon. [Now] we are lead to infer that Horus gathered about him an army which, meeting the hosts of Typhon, battled with them for many days, achieving victory. Typhon [according to the legend] was taken prisoner and turned over to the custody of Isis. [Now, Isis,] being his sister, could not [bring herself] to put him to death but set him at liberty which so incensed Horus that he laid hands upon his mother and removed from her head the insignia of royalty; thereupon Thoth gave her a new helmet made in the shape of an ox’s head. Typhon next accused Horus of illegitimacy, but Thoth proves his royal descent. Typhon again goes into battle against Horus, in fact, two battles are mentioned in both of which Typhon is worsted, and Horus regains the kingdom of his father and is regarded, to at least a certain degree, as the actual reincarnation of Osiris.\" [William Cooper]: So, here you have a death and a resurrection. \"After its resurrection in the underworld, the shade of Osiris visits Isis and in consequence thereof she gives birth to another son, as it were, by a Holy Ghost, for she knew no living man. This child is called Harpocrates and Plutarch says of him that he 'came into the world before his time, and lame in his lower limbs.' Harpocrates is usually depicted as a nude figure, his head adorned with a single curling lock of hair on the right side, this being with the Egyptians a symbol of youth or adolescence. He is sometimes depicted with an elaborate plumed headdress or wearing the double crown of the northern and southern empires. His finger is placed to his lips which Plutarch interprets as a gesture symbolic of his childish and helpless state. The Greeks and Romans, however, considered this gesture to be a symbol for silence [William Cooper: or secrecy] and from this has arisen the custom of placing the finger to the lips as a motion for quietness and secrecy [William Cooper: and we do it today]. Statues of the god Harpocrates were placed at the entrances to temples and sacred retreats where the dramas of the Mysteries were performed as a sign that silence and secrecy should be observed in the holy places and that all Initiates were bound by vows of discretion. Harpocrates is [also] sometimes shown standing, and another times he is depicted seated on a blossom of a lotus [William Cooper: (laughs) just like Buddha]. Although he is usually figured with childish immaturity of body, the imperfection of his lower limbs, as described by Plutarch, is not apparent in any of the Egyptian drawings. It, therefore, seems that the statements concerning this deformity should be more carefully examined. Samuel Squire, whose translation of Plutarch's Isis and Osiris , made in 1744, is still the most often quoted by Egyptologists, [well it] states definitely, 'lame in his lower limbs.' G.R.S. Mead translated the same essay much later and gives a slightly different rendering of Plutarch's words. Mr. Mead says: \"weak in his limbs from below upwards.' This difference in wording, though slight, may have an unexpected significance. \"[You see,] there is some general information contained in Synesius's treatise On Providence that should be included in this...Osirian epic. Synesius is of the opinion that Osiris should be regarded as an historical king whose father transcending in wisdom, instructed his benevolent son in all the secrets of the divine science of government. Synesius is moved to this conclusion by a desire to keep all speculation within the sphere of the reasonable. The Platonist bishop seems to have derived much of his account from origins foreign to Plutarch’s treatise, or possibly he interpreted differently the restrictions imposed by his vows. Synesius...a prudent and conscientious author, wary of myths and fables, and exhibiting a truly Platonic conservativeness in his handling of subject matter, yet Synesius was beyond question a deeply religious philosopher and an Initiate of pagan Mysteries prior to his conversion to the Christian faith [William Cooper: and therefore may have hidden the true meaning of the fable]. Thomas Taylor is of the mind that the treatise On Providence was written while Synesius was still a votary of pagan Mysteries. [Now,] if so, the writing is unbiased and trustworthy and presents a fair picture on the mystical traditions of the Egyptians interpreted in terms of platonic metaphysics.\" [William Cooper]: But only the exoteric would be allowed to be seen by the profane. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"Synesius inserts into his narrative a considerable description of the various [*note: book says virtuous] character of Osiris which he sharply contrasts with the vice ‐ ridden nature of Typhon. He also explains in detail the process of election by which Osiris came to the throne of Egypt. The electional ceremony, as described by Synesius, is evidently itself a fragment from some secret ritual relating to the installation of a hierophant of the Mysteries. Next Osiris receives from his father an elaborate dissertation in the Platonic temper concerning the relative power of good and evil in which he is fully warned against the machinations of Typhon. Possibly the most important sentence in Synesius’s treatise occurs during this dissertation. The father of Osiris is made to say to his son: 'You also have been initiated in those Mysteries in which there are two pair of eyes, and it is requisite that the pair which are beneath should be closed when the pair that are above them perceive, and when the pair above are closed, those which are beneath should be opened.' \"[Now,] these words unquestionably have an arcane meaning and are incorporated into the narrative that the true significance of the whole Osirian cycle might not be entirely obscured.\" [William Cooper]: And I can tell you that the meaning, folks, is that the eyes above are the exoteric meant for the outer world, for the profane, and the eyes below are the esoteric, meant for the initiate, the adept, the priests of the Mystery Schools only. \"Synesius does not describe the death of Osiris, but merely reports his banishment and final restoration to the throne. In the latter part of the story there is also introduced 'a certain philosopher, who was a stranger in Egypt.' This philosopher predicts the fall of Typhon and is an eyewitness to the recrowning of Osiris. Synesius says of this philosopher: 'He, likewise, then learned some particulars about Osiris which would shortly happen, and others which would take place at some greater distance of time viz., when the boy Horus would choose as is his associate in battle a wolf instead of a lion. But who the wolf is, is a sacred narration, which it is not holy to divulge, even in a form of a fable.'\" [William Cooper]: Well the lion, we know, has always been of the Tribe of Judah. \"Such is the amazing tradition of the good king Osiris, the first victim, the first mummy, and the first resurrection. He dies and is born again in three forms. First, as god of the underworld where he rules the justified dead; second, as the younger Horus in whose form he battles for his own honor; and third, as Harpocrates, the silent child. The latter two forms are regarded as incarnations or embodiments of his very self, yet he exists independent of them as the judge of shades and the lord of the resurrection.\" [William Cooper]: Now, we know that Osiris was also known as the sun, and Horus was known as the child or the young Osiris, the young Horus, the baby Horus. So, after the sun set in the west, when it rose the next morning it had rose as the young Horus, and, as it went across the sky, it became Osiris, and then the elder. But in the legends, it’s differently, at different times, Osiris or Horus: Horus the younger, Horus at his peak strength at noon and Horus the elder. It is also Osiris. So you see that these figures intermingle in the legend, but it all has meaning and it will all be clear to you in a later time. [William Cooper]: Now, just because you don’t understand some of this and you may be a little lost...don’t worry, it will come together. Don’t , don’t miss one single word of this series of episodes of the Hour of the Time. If you do I can guarantee you, you will regret it for the rest of your life. We’re going to stop right now, folks. We have to take a break. I will be back right after this very short pause. (break music: dark, forbidding instrumental music) \"Nearly all writers attempting an interpretation on the Osirian Cycle have recourse to Plutarch. It has seemingly never occurred to Egyptologists that this imminent priest of Delphi might have purposely confused or distorted the fable, or, if not that, might certainly have misdirected the attention of the reader from relevant to irrelevant explanations. Two factors must certainly be taken into consideration when reading Plutarch. First, he was an initiated priest of the Mysteries; of this there can be no doubt for he himself says, 'For the mystic symbols are well known to us who belong to the Brotherhood.'\" [William Cooper]: In those days it was known as the \"Brotherhood of the Snake,\" and those who possessed the knowledge of the Secrets of the Ages wore the symbol of the snake on their headdress. And in the Egyptian Hieroglyphics, you can see the members of the Mystery Religion of Babylon in the hieroglyphics as they wore the snake from the front of their forehead. \"It should be evident [to everybody] that, as an Initiate, Plutarch would not have unveiled the secret meaning of the Osirian myth [William Cooper: and I found that to be absolutely true]. No man of his priestly station or philosophic mind, who so greatly venerated the gods as to attach himself to their service, would have been guilty of the impiety of profaning their Mysteries [William Cooper: and he would not have violated his oath of secrecy]. Furthermore, had his treatise actually exposed any of the secrets of the rites, he would most probably have perished miserably or at least have been publicly disgraced. These evils, not descending upon him, we must suppose 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"that his book was regarded as harmless and for our purpose, therefore, at least not directly informative... \"...The second factor, which gravitates against the likelihood of Plutarch’s interpretations being correct, is the condition of Egyptian metaphysics in the first century after Christ. If, as Budge maintains, the Egyptians were unaware of the meaning of the word 'Osiris' long prior to the Christian era, into what decay had the old rites fallen even prior to the Ptolemaic period? [Now] Plutarch based his accounts upon popular traditions, they were most certainly inaccurate and it is not impossible that even the priests themselves were for the most part ignorant of the origins of their doctrine. It should not be inferred [folks,] from the general literature available concerning [William Cooper: this Osirian cycle and] the Mysteries that all of the priests were themselves initiates of a high order. Only a small part of them ever actually received the greater secrets of their order; for the rest, rite and ritual suffered [*note: book say sufficed] [William Cooper: and it's the same today]... \"...Democritus spent a great part of his life in Egypt and from the priests of that nation he secured the foundation for his celebrated doctrine of atoms [William Cooper: that’s right, folks, atoms, A ‐ T ‐ O ‐ M ‐ S], a doctrine which has survived as a scientific fact to this day. From all these different philosophers who visited Egypt we shall secure a better estimation of the profoundity of Egyptian learning then from even the Egyptian writings themselves.\" [William Cooper]: Plato went to Egypt and was initiated into the Mysteries in the Great Pyramid, where he lay for three days and three nights in the sarcophagus during which he was imparted knowledge which he was to guard...protect. He describes his initiation in his writings. I suggest that you read it. \"If we may assume the Pragmatic viewpoint that the substance of matter is to be determined from its consequences, [then] we must indeed highly reverence the wisdom of the Egyptians for it seems that first among the consequences of that wisdom is civilization itself [William Cooper: that cannot be doubted]. Civilization is no fable, nor is it a progeny of myths, but that which is real and substantial in it bears witness to a profound and superior wisdom which must have existed over a great period of time and have then communicated to at least a privileged few, since the very beginning of man's cultural impulse. \"[Now,] we can also take the example of Pythagoras. This great philosopher while a youth, if we may credit Iamblichus, associated himself with Thales of Miletus from whom he gained a considerable knowledge of the Mysteries. Thales, being at that time of great age and infirm body, apologized for his incomplete understanding of the sacred doctrines and urged Pythagoras to visit Egypt the mother land of wisdom [William Cooper: as it was called in those days]. Iamblichus wrote that Thales confessed that his own reputation for wisdom was derived from the instruction of these priests; but that he was neither naturally, nor by exercise, induced with those excellent prerogatives which were so visibly displayed in the person of Pythagoras. Thales, therefore, gladly announced to Pythagoras, from all these circumstances, that he would become the wisest and the most divine of all men, if he associated with these Egyptian priests. Iamblichus then describes the journey which Pythagoras made to Egypt, how en route he was initiated into the Mysteries of several nations and at last arriving at his destination, was received by the Egyptian priests with respect and affection. He associated with the Egyptian philosophers for some time and after demonstrating by his sincerity and consecration that he was worthy to associate with the initiated, he was at last admitted into the secrets of their orders. \"'He spent, therefore,' observes Iamblichus, 'two and twenty years in Egypt and, in the adyta of temples, astronomizing and geometrizing, and was initiated, not in a superficial or casual manner, in all the Mysteries of the gods.' \"Pythagoras must be acknowledged among the first of those divine men to whom the race is indebted for the principles of science, art and philosophy; and are we to presume that so noble an intellect could have twenty ‐ two years pursuing fabulous shadows in Egyptian crypts? If, as some have asserted, [that] Osiris signified merely the Nile, and Isis, the black earth rendered fertile by its inundation, could such a fable have so greatly stimulated the admiration of Pythagoras that he would have spent a score of years in the assimilation of the idea? [William Cooper: I don't think so.] Or, again, would he have spent this great length of time, the very best years of his life, in memorizing the myth ‐ encrusted history of an ancient king who at some remote period have reigned in Egypt and whose memory seems sufficient to inspire a vast civilization for some 6,000 years?\" [William Cooper]: By the way, that's the exact number of years in the calender of the Mystery School and of the Freemasons. \"Or, to approach the matter from another of these 'explanations' would Pythagoras have pounded himself for a score of years against the walls of Memphis and find himself fully rewarded by being informed with bated breath by some archi ‐ magus that Isis is the dog ‐ star? [William Cooper: I think not.] \"It is not impossible that in the course of it’s long and illustrious history [, folks,] Egypt devised many opinions relative to her sacred myths; but no such explanation has involved Egypt alone, her histories, her heroes, or her agricultural problems, could have caused illustrious men from all parts of the world to have visited her in quest of essential wisdom [William Cooper: the central core of which is the myth of Osiris, Isis and Horus, known as the Osirian cycle]. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"The Nile meant nothing to the Greeks who cared little whether it rose or fell...\" [William Cooper]: The sneezing you hear in the background is my dog, Sugarbear, who always accompanies me into the studio to do these programs. \"...Not Egypt but the umbos of Delphi was the center of their universe [in Greece], and local fables derived from Egypt’s forty ‐ two nomes could never have won for the double Empire its illustrious reputation as patron of all learning, human and divine. So, we must look deeper...\" [William Cooper]: ...and look deeper we did, folks, and what we found is amazing. For we found that Osiris and Isis and Horus were not ever have meant to be, nor were they ever, real people, or real gods, or spacemen who came from some other world. Not at all. As we have found in our research, and as I have found in my over twenty some odd years of research into the Mystery Schools, they're like all the other symbols of the Mystery Religion for the public, for the profane. They are the exoteric, and you may make of them what you wish. The Adepts, the Initiates, the priests...they don’t care what interpretation you give the exoteric meaning. And the esoteric is so entirely different from what you may suspect that the answer will surprise you. [William Cooper]: You see, we cannot be deceived by the obvious, and you can never be deceived by the obvious or even consider the obvious when looking at any of the Mystery Religions or the secret doctrine. And we cannot allow ourselves to be misdirected by the evident subterfuges, the deceptions, of these ancient priests who so carefully concealed their arcana from the uninitiated world that we, at this late time, may even doubt its existence. Yet now, today, it is thriving to the point that it controls all levels of our society, military and government. The ignorant, the sheeple, even among the Egyptians, might derive their inspirations from the processionals and rituals of the state religion, but that’s just for the sheeple. For those great philosophers who came from afar were in search of the highest form of human knowledge, the ancient arts, the Secrets of the Ages, and could not be satisfied by such outer show. Had these fables been but hollow and unsubstantial forms, Egypt would have been the ridicule of the wise, who would speedily have exposed her sham and reduced her vain pretense to a humble state. But this did not occur. You see, the initiates of her Mysteries returning to their own countries not only felt themselves more than repaid for their hazardous journeys and long vigils, but furthermore, they became founders of distinguished systems of thinking, disseminators of useful knowledge and in all cases bore witness to a broad and deep learning. And they always took with them a plan, a plan for the unfoldment of a world Utopian government, which plan exists still today, and is still being carried out in secret as the completion of the Great Work. \"Diodorus describes two famous columns erected near Nysa in Arabia, one to Isis and the other to Osiris.\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, Osiris and Isis never lived. They were not real people and they were never gods. They are symbols for something much deeper. So, when you listen to the interpretations of the inscriptions on the columns, remember that. \"The column to Isis bears this inscription: 'I am Isis, Queen of this country. I was instructed by Mercury. No one can destroy the laws which I have established. I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, the most ancient of gods. I am the wife and sister of Osiris the king. I first made known to mortals the use of wheat. I am the mother of Horus the king. In my honor was the city of Bubastis built. Rejoice, O Egypt, rejoice, land that gave me birth.' \"The column to Osiris bore these words: 'I am Osiris the king, who led my armies into all parts of the world, to the most thickly inhabited countries of India, the north, the Danube, and the ocean. I am the eldest son of Saturn; I was born of a brilliant and magnificent egg, and my substance is of the same nature as that which composes light. There is no place in the Universe where I have not appeared, to bestow my benefit and make known my discoveries.' [And] the rest of the inscription [, of course,] was destroyed.\" [William Cooper]: Now, while the inscription on the pillar, or the obelisk, in honor of Isis may be veiled, the inscription on the obelisk dedicated to Osiris is certainly not. He 'was born of a brilliant and magnificent egg and its substance is of the same nature of that which composes light. There is no place in the Universe where I have not appeared.' Osiris, of course, was the sun. \"In examining Plutarch's treatise, the introductory remarks appear of special significance, yet [folks] these remarks are wholly ignored by Egyptologists who are contempt to confine themselves entirely to the fable which constitutes the larger part of the writing. If Plutarch, by any word or symbol, revealed even a small part of the sacred mystery, it is to be found in the following words: 'For Isis, according to the Greek interpretation of the word, signifies knowledge ; as does the name of her professed adversary Typhon, [signify] insolence and pride , a name therefore extremely well adapted to one, who, full of ignorance and error, tears in pieces and conceals that holy doctrine , which the Goddess collects, compiles and delivers to those, who aspire after the most perfect participation of the divine nature.' [William Cooper]: Now, if you have a keen intellect, you can all decipher everything else that I'm going tell you on this program and probably the next one in that short paragraph, and I let you ponder that as I continue. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\"Osiris, the black god of the Nile, must be regarded as the personification of an order of learning, for Plutarch identifies him beyond question with the holy doctrine, or the Mystery tradition.\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, I told you Osiris is the symbol of the sun, but the sun was the symbol of the power of the all ‐ encompassing god of the universe. And later you’re going to learn that the light, or the sun, represents something even deeper. It represents, dear listeners, [ primordial knowing , the gift of intellect. And where people can read these myths and think that these people really worshiped the sun or some god somewhere, they are mistaken. For the true object of their worship is the intellect, and through the use of that intellect they believe that man will become god. \"As Thoth personifies the whole sphere of knowledge and it was through his assistance that Osiris came into being, so Osiris embodies the secret and sacred wisdom reserved for those who were proficients in the ancient rites. Unquestionably Osiris was later confused with other members of that vast pantheon of divinities which developed in the decadent period of Egyptian religious culture, but to the elect, [the initiate, the adept, the priest,] he represented to the end primordial knowing , that utter realization of truth undefiled by intellection, unlimited by any mortal procedure, uncircumscribed by the limitation of thinking. [You see,] he signified not only that divine at ‐ one ‐ ment with the Absolute which is the end of all illumination, but by his life, death and resurrection, revealed the means by which mortal consciousness could achieve that end. [William Cooper: Now remember, 'at ‐ one ‐ ment.'] Thus Osiris becomes a dual symbol, being in first place the esoteric wisdom , [William Cooper: esoteric folks means 'hidden', so he represented in the first place the esoteric wisdom] itself, and in the second place, the composite order of Initiates through whom that tradition was perpetuated [William Cooper: and now we begin to strip the veil from the Mysteries]. The personality of Osiris thus typifies the institution erected by the ancients to perpetuate the deathless truths of the soul. The living head was crowned with the plumes of wisdom and power, the hands bore the scepters of the three worlds, but the body was bound with the mummy wrappings of the dead. Here we find spirit, the living head bound incongruously to matter, the mummified body. The soul was imprisoned in the narrow bounds of flesh. One thing [in my research] is certain: Osiris represented the Secret Doctrine prior to that time when the omnific Word [William Cooper: or the Lost Word of Freemasonry] was lost. \"Osiris is the first of the five children of Nut...\" [William Cooper]: ...and here you begin to part some more veils behind which the mystery resides... \"...he therefore corresponds with the first of the five divine kings of China and the five exoterically known Dhyana ‐ Buddhas of Lamaism. The five children of Nut are the five continents which have appeared upon the earth and the five races which have populated these continents. Osiris is the primitive revelation of the first race, but as Isis was born upon the fourth day, we find that this tradition coming into Egypt through the Atlantean Mystery School of which Isis is the symbol.\" [William Cooper]: And you will find at the base of all these things: Atlantis. Francis Bacon wrote about Atlantis. Hitler believed in Atlantis. In this country the Freemasons established the city of Atlanta as the new Atlantis. And all of this will come together for you. It took me many, many, many years of study deep into the night and trying to discuss this with other people who had no idea what I was talking about. So most of it was put together in loneliness late at night, and then when I established my organization known as the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence [CAJI], many others began to help and furnish bits and pieces of information. And we have succeeded folks in infiltrating the Lodge. We have members in the Lodge who feed us information constantly; members whom we taught how to take an oath so that the oath of Freemasonry would not be binding upon them. You have to play sometimes by the rules of the enemy in order to beat the enemy and we are beating the enemies now. \"From the reign of Osiris we glean the following philosophical history. [They believe that] there was a time, the Golden Age, when truth and wisdom ruled the earth, and this aristocracy of wisdom was a benevolent despotism [William Cooper: and that’s what they want to reestablish. Benevolent to who? (laughs) That’s the question.] in which men were lad to a nobler state of being by the firm kindly hand of the enlightened sage. This was the divine dynasty of the mythological priest ‐ kings who were qualified to govern humanity by virtue not only temporal but by divine attributes. Through his priests, Osiris, representative of the hidden tradition, ruled the entire world by virtue of the perfection resident in that tradition.\" Don’t miss tomorrow night, folks. You have not even begun your journey. Good night, and God bless each and every one of you.

(opening music: Also sprach Zarathustra (theme song of 2001: A Space Odyssey ) by Richard Strauss, electronic/disco version) [William Cooper does commercial for the Pilot Connection] Well, folks, we left off with a great revelation, for those of you who were listening last night. For those of you who weren't, you need to order the tapes, beginning with the tape of February the 11th, Thursday night, February the 11th. This was ‐‐ the name of the tape was, \"The Dawn of Man.\" And this series actually starts on Friday night, February the 12th, but you need the tape, \"The Dawn of Man.\" Order all the tapes in this series, because if you really want to know what's going on, how it has been kept alive for thousands of years, and what the ultimate goal is: their origins, their histories, their dogma and their absolute identity, then you need this whole series. [William Cooper gives contact information to order tapes] Well, let me continue. And I think tonight is really going to open your eyes, and remember, we're nowhere near even begun. We've got a lot of shows to do on this, folks, and it's going to blow your mind if it hasn't already. I think some of you out there already know that. [Reading from Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians , by Manly Hall]: \"[Now,] if we concede that Osiris is the positive pole of the universal life agent, [William Cooper: as the Mystery School does,] then Isis becomes the receptive pole of that activity. He is the doctrine, she is the church. As in Christianity it is customary to refer the church as the bride of Christ, so in Egypt the institution of the Mysteries was the great Mother, the consort of Heaven itself. From this interpretation we gain a deeper insight into the symbolism of the whole of Osirian cycle. Isis [you see] becomes the temporal order of the priesthood, the accumulative body of Initiates. She is personified as the temple; she is the mother of all good, the protectress of all right, and the patron of all improvement.\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, this is the belief of the Mystery Schools. I'm not telling you what I believe. What you're learning on this program is what the Mystery Religion really is: its origin, its history, its dogma, and its identity. So don't get confused, here...don't get confused. \"[According to the Mystery Schools] she insures nobility, inspires virtue and awakens the nobler passions of the soul. As Diana of Ephesus she is the multimammia who feeds all creatures from herself.\" [William Cooper]: And many of you may have seen illustrations and books, or little statues or portraits or pictures on someone's wall of Isis in the role of the Multimammia where she has many breasts all over her torso, and on her legs and her arms, all over her body. Well, that's what this represents. \"As Diana of Ephesus she is the Multimammia who feeds all creatures from herself. Like the moon she shines only with the light of her sovereign sun [William Cooper: spelled S ‐ U ‐ N] even as the temple can only be illumined by its indwelling truth.\" 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: So, Isis is the Moon. Osiris is the Sun. And remember, remember what this means folks. He is the doctrine. She is the church. You see, the Osirian legend, the Osirian cycle, was never about real people, was never about gods or goddesses, but it is the method by which the real object of worship and the real mystery of the Mystery Religion of Babylon has been concealed. And it is only one of the ways, as you will see. \"Typhon [according to the Mystery Schools] is the embodiment of every perversity. He is the negative creation, the Ahriman of Zoroasterism.\" [William Cooper]: And remember, we talked last Thursday about the movie 2001 , and in the beginning of the movie, the musical score that you hear, the name of it is Also sprach Zarathustra , which is a tribute to Zoroaster, which is the androgynous god. The combination in one of the positive and negative, good, evil, male, female, etc., etc., etc. It is the concept that Christ is also Lucifer, or that they are twins, and that's what they teach in the Mormon church. \"Typhon [according to Mystery Schools] is black magic and sorcery ‐‐ the Black Brotherhood [William Cooper: also known as the Jesuit Order]. Nephthys, his wife, is the institution through which it manifests. He is neither a single evil nor even a sequence of ills, but an infinite diversity of them, indescribably insidious, empowered to infect the fabric of...church and state.\" [William Cooper]: The enemy of the Mystery Schools are three: the church, the state and the mob, and, of course, the mob is us. \"Typhon lured Osiris in to the ark of destruction at the time when the sun enters the house of the Scorpion, hence, we know him to be the eternal betrayer, [or Judas,] that ageless Judas, who undoes all good things and inevitably presages ruin. He is the power of the physical universe which is constantly seeking to destroy the spiritual values locked within its substances.\" [William Cooper]: You will see that they have a talent for turning things around. \"He strikes in the eighth month, and now it is supposed that a child delivered in the eighth month of the prenatal epoch cannot live because of the curse of Typhon. Osiris was born in the seventh month and therefore it may be said of him that he was delivered prior to the rule of Typhon...\" [William Cooper]: ...and that's why our forefathers, all Freemasons, established this country by the signing of the Declaration of Independence in the month of July. And this will all become clearer to you as we go along. \"Of all good things Typhon is the opposer [according to the Mystery Schools], occupying the position of the eternal negative. This evil monster made well be generalized under the appellation of the Adversary. In the initiation rites he also the tester or the tryer, 'the lord who is against us.' [According to the Mystery Religion,] he is the personification of ambition, and ambition is the patron of ruin. It was ambition that set Typhon plotting for the throne of Egypt, designing how he could destroy the power of his brother. A learned Jesuit father sees in Typhon, Cain, and his brother Osiris, Abel. If such a parallel actually exists, then the Biblical allegory is susceptible of the same interpretation.\" [William Cooper]: But, you see, they have twisted everything around. [William Cooper]: Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was a Jesuit priest and a professor at Ingolstadt University, which is a Jesuit university. The Jesuit Order was founded by Ignatius Loyola. He was the head of the Alumbrados in Spain, which is the order of Illuminati long before Adam Weishaupt even came along. He was arrested by the Dominican Monks under the Inquisition and used his power of association, of those who had influence and power, to beg an audience with the pope. Now, nobody knows what occurred during this audience. But he emerged as the head of a new order called the Jesuits. Now, the Jesuits was just another name for the Alumbrado, for he took his organization that he already controlled and made it into the brotherhood of the Jesuits. The Jesuits went on to foment rebellion everywhere that they went and the pope gave them incredible power and made Ignatius Loyola immune to any prosecution from any source. And it was they who trained Adam Weishaupt, and it was Adam Weishaupt who formed the branch of what we all know as the Illumined Ones known as the Illuminati in Bavaria. For he sent out agents to infiltrate the lodges of the secret societies throughout Europe. [William Cooper]: Now, you will begin to understand this even more, folks, as we go along. Right now I understand how shocking some of this may be to some of you out there. But just hang on, continue to listen because we have many, many more hours of this to go before it will all come together for you. But I would suggest that you begin study on your own. Doesn't matter if you get ahead of us, because you'll always need some of the information that I'm putting out here no matter how ahead you may get or what you already may know simply because I've done well over 23 years of research into this and I must know something that you don't know. And if you know something that I don't please send it to me immediately and if we can substantiate it, we will incorporate into this series. Now let 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"me continue: \"Typhus lured Osiris into the ark of destruction at the time when the sun enters the house of the Scorpion. Hence, we know him to be the eternal betrayer or Judas, that ageless Judas who undoes all good things and inevitably presages ruin.\" [William Cooper]: Now, this may sound to you that we're talking about Satan or the Devil, but you see, in the Mystery Schools, they consider their god Lucifer to be the true good god, and they consider the God of Christianity to be the evil god. [William Cooper]: Now if you listened on the night of the 10th you ‐‐ er, excuse me, the 11th of February, Thursday, you already understand this concept. Because the Mystery Religion of Babylon believes that man was held prison, in the bonds of ignorance in the Garden of Eden by an unjust, vindictive God. Lucifer through his agent Satan, and many believe them to be the same entity and that's okay, Lucifer through his agent Satan released man from the bonds of ignorance with the gift of intellect and through use of that intellect, man himself will become God. And that's the heart and soul of the dogma of the Mystery Religion of Babylon. [William Cooper]: Now, since I am taking the content of all these episodes directly from their own teachings in their own writings so that's you'll know that this is exactly what they believe. Sometimes it may sound you like these are the good guys. But remember, they are the ultimate perfection of deception, and they have intentionally made it this way so that they can get people to join them and stay with them until they are so deeply involved and committed that it's too late. And that is why the degrees of initiation. So stick it out and you'll find out with these guys are the greatest liars, deceivers, manipulators and scum that exist upon the face of the earth. \"Typhon [in their teachings] is the desire of the few pitted against the good of the many. [William Cooper: Now if you understand what I just said, you understand that these are communists, socialists. They believe Typhon] is the spirit of dissension and discord that breaks up unity of purpose by setting factions against each other so that great issues lose the name of action. The desire for riches, pomp, power, and [listen to this, folks,] sovereignty by which this evil genius was obsessed, reveals the temptation by which humanity is deflected from its ultimate goal and led into the byways of sorrow and despair. Typhon, the Queen of Ethiopia, and the seventy ‐ two conspirators represent the three destructive powers, preserved to modern Freemasonry as the murderers of the Master Builder...\" [William Cooper]: Hiram Abiff. You will see Hiram Abiff was never murdered. In fact, in the Bible you will see that, when the Temple of Solomon was completed, he went back home to Tyre, but in the Freemason Legend, Hiram Abiff, the Master Builder, was killed and the temple was never completed. So everybody is blaming all of this upon the Jews. It is not the Jews, folks, because all of this is a front. It's symbology for what they really, really mean. Hiram Abiff was really, folks, Jacques de Molay of the Knights Templar. And all of this will make much more sense to you several shows down the road because we have lots and lots of information to go through before you put it all together. [William Cooper]: Now these three destructive powers preserved to the Modern Mystery School known as Freemasonry as the murderers of the Master Builder, Hiram Abiff, who was really Jacques de Molay, \"are ignorance, superstition, and fear, [what they call] the destroyers of all good things.\" [William Cooper]: When you get even deeper into their teachings, you find out that ignorance, superstition and fear stand for the state, the church and the mob. And those are the things that they have sworn to destroy and substitute themselves as the ruler of the world in a benevolent despotism. A totalitarian socialist state because from the very beginning, these people have been pure, true communists, socialists. They are the heart and soul and core of international socialism. \"[They believe] the advent of greed and perversion marked the end of the Golden Age ‐‐ the Osirian Age...\" [William Cooper]: ...which the Osirian Cycle is just a symbology of this and the Golden Age, of course, golden, or Oro , always has stood for the sun. Osiris is representative of the sun and outwardly these people worship the sun, but the sun is just another symbol for their god Lucifer, the light, the intellect. \" ‐‐ and when the good prince Osiris, the deeper truth, returned to his own land, he became the victim of a hideous plot. [So,] what is this mysterious chest, so beautiful in its outer appearance but so fatal in its application? [Well, folks, Plato, who was] wise in the wisdom of the Egyptians [William Cooper: and who was an initiate of the Mystery School] would have answered that it was the body that lures the soul into the sorrows of generation. [Now] if this interpretation be projected into the social sphere, the chest becomes symbolic of material organization. Witness the application of this thought to Christianity where the pomp and glory of the outer show of a vast ecclesiastical mechanism has all but destroyed the simplicity and dignity of the primitive revelation [of the Mysteries].\" [William Cooper]: That is their exact words. See, I didn't make that up. Those aren't my words. Those are the words of the Mystery School and it is an indication, if you didn't think so yet, that Christianity is their enemy. They intend to destroy Christianity and all Christians. The blood will flow when the New World Order takes power in the world and if you sit back and say, \"Well, I'm not worried 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"because I'm going to be raptured,\" I feel sorry for you because you are going to suffer tremendously. Because in my research I have found that most of the theologians in the Protestant religion of all denominations who were responsible for this doctrine of the rapture are Freemasons and they are in control of the World Council of Churches. They are responsible for the bringing together of the different religions in the World Council of Churches to attempt to merge them all into one and then change the doctrine to the New World Religion. [William Cooper]: Now, if you don't believe that, you get off your little butts and go out there and start looking instead of just listening and accepting. For it is true, and their doctrine, folks, is Zionism. I can tell you right now, Jerry Falwell has admitted publicly that he is a Zionist, and we know that he is also a member of the Mystery Schools and many others that you follow blindly instead reading the words of Jesus Christ. You're all split up. You know the original teachings of Christ have been so perverted, that there are thousands of different sects of the Protestant religion and the Vatican is the original perversion of the Mysteries, established by a pagan Roman emperor, a worshiper of the sun. [William Cooper]: I hope you're all beginning to open your mind. Now I know I'm going to get a lot of letters from a lot of fanatics who don't believe this and those are the people who will be hurt the most when they find out that it is all true. When they find out that it is all true. Back to their doctrine... \"The murderers rushed from the palace with the lead ‐ sealed casket and cast it and its kingly contents into the dark waters of the Nile. Thus are the ideals, which lead men into the paths of truth and righteousness, obscured, and with truth no longer evident, [William Cooper: according to them] error [which is the Christian church] can rule supreme. Typhon [William Cooper: by now you should know that Typhon is their designation for Christianity. Typhon] ascended the throne as regent of the world, swinishly gloating over a dejected humanity he had led into dark and devious byways. By the Nile may we not understand the river of generation, in the current of which souls, imprisoned in mortal nature, move helplessly on the never ceasing current?\" \"[Now, they believe that truth is dead and according to their belief] with truth dead, or at least exiled to the invisible world, material facts were superseded by opinions; opinions bred hatreds, and men finally fought and died over notions both senseless and soulless.\" [William Cooper]: And that is another deception and another lie, for in my research I found that in every instance of the most terrible things in wars that have ever happened on the face of the earth, these men are the ones who have brought it about...have brought it about. \"Greed became the dominating impulse, [they say] gain the all ‐ absorbing end, and ruthlessness the all ‐ sufficient means. In the dark ages of uncertainty when reality hid its face and no man dared to know, the leering Typhon ruled his ill ‐ gotten world, binding men to himself by breeding a thousand uncertainties to sap courage and weaken conviction. Men asked, 'Why seek to know? Knowledge does not exist and life is a cruel jest, purposeless and of short duration.' Because the human mind demanded intellectual expression, Typhon sowed the seeds of intellectual confusion so that numerous orders of learning appeared which were convincingly plausible but untrue. These various order of thought survived by catering to the weaknesses and limitations of the flesh. Today our great industrial civilization is feeling the heavy hand of an outraged destiny; the evil genius of our ambitions has again undone us and made our follies crumbled about us. Typhon rules the world, for earth today is the arena of the ambitious.\" [William Cooper]: Remember, Typhoon is their symbol for Christianity. Don't go away, folks. I've got to take a short break. I'll be right back after this short pause. I want you to have a pencil and paper with you. I'm going to give you some information. I shall return. (break music: none) Well, that didn't take long, did it? [William Cooper does commercial for the Pilot Connection and CAJI memberships] [William Cooper]: Well let's get back to where we left off, folks. \"What, then, of Isis, the mother of the Mysteries? She who was so defiled and desecrated by the profane that her sages and prophets were forced to flee into the wilderness to escape the machinations of the evil one? Is she not the 'woman clothed with the sun' of Revelation who flees with her man ‐ child into the wilderness to escape the evil purposes of the great dragon?\" 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Well, folks, that's what the Mystery School believes, but I can tell you that's not true. You see, the Mystery School was the original college run by Nimrod in the city of Babylon, and the college was a college of priests who practice the religion of the sun. The college, the adepts, the initiates, the priests were scattered all over the world when Seth, the son of Noah, came with an army and defeated Nimrod, and this is where the legend really comes from because Seth chopped Nimrod up into little pieces and scattered him all over the land. In the legend of the Osirian cycle, Osiris was chopped into fourteen pieces. Isis came to put him back together again and bring him to life. She could find all the pieces save one, the phallus, or the generative force. It is now known as the Lost Word Freemasonry, and the phallus is represented by the obelisk, the monolith. It is the penis of Osiris, the generative force. It represents Lost Word of Freemasonry, it represents the Luciferian philosophy. It represents the light, the sun, Lucifer the intellect. [William Cooper]: In Dealey Plaza, you will find an obelisk. In Washington D.C., you will find obelisk, known as the Washington Monument. In the courtyard of the Vatican, you will find an obelisk. Should I continue? The family in England, whose estates are called Syon House, has an obelisk on their lawns. Should I go on? I will. I will go on and on and on and on until you either wake up or I am dead, one or the other. And if you don't wake up, I would rather be dead than live in slavery in the New World Order with our Constitution destroyed, the family broken, the children taken from the homes to be raised by the state, Christians and patriots locked in prison camps, labor camps, until they are no longer useful, and then they will be executed. And the blood will run in the New World Order. If you don't believe me, look back at every single nation where international socialism has triumphed over Christianity. And you will see that tens of millions perished or destroyed. Socialism, folks, sucks, and I will not live under such a system and I hope you agree with me. If you don't like my language, that's tough. I'm fighting a battle against people with no morals, no decency, no heart, no soul ...no soul. They do not even believe in God. They do not even believe in God. \"The glory of Egypt [according to these people] ceased with the death of Osiris. The mighty temples still stood but the god who illuminated them had gone. The priests bowed helplessly before the dead embers of their altars. [And] one by one the sanctuaries crumbled into ruin in the custodians of these ancient truths hid themselves in obscure corners of the earth lest they be hunted down and slain for the sin of dreaming and hoping for better day. Isis, then, as the scattered but still consecrated body of Initiates, began the great search for the secret that was lost.\" [William Cooper]: And this is all in reference to Seth's army scattering the college of priests in the ancient city of Babylon. And later, it refers to the Knights Templar who brought the Mysteries from the Middle East to Europe. In the beginning, folks, they were never a part of the Catholic Church, as you will learn. And they still exist today irregardless [sic] of what you've ever been taught, for they are the Mystery School today. \"In all parts of the world [according to their teachings] the virtuous raised their hands to the heavens, pleading for the restoration of the reign of truth. This congregation of those who prayed who labored and who waited, the great congregation of a world in anguish ‐‐ this is Isis in sackcloth and ashes, searching for the body of her lord. \"Searching in all parts of the earth and throughout innumerable ages, inspired men and women, the congregation of the just, at last rediscovered the lost arcana and brought it back with rejoicing to the world over which it once ruled. Isis, by magic ‐‐ for the initiated priests were all magicians ‐‐ [William Cooper: and they are magicians today] resurrected the dead god and through union with him brought forth an order of priests under the collective title of Horus, the hawk, the all ‐ seeing bird [William Cooper: whose eye is on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States of America]. These were the Herj Seshta or the companions of Horus, and the chief of these, called by Lewis Spence 'the Chief of the Mysteries par excellence,' appears to have worn the dog ‐ headed mask of Anubis. Anubis was the son of Osiris by Nephthys, the material world, therefore represents the divine man or the mortal being who rose to enlightenment.\" [William Cooper]: And those who rose to enlightenment were considered illumined. Collectively they are known as the Illuminati, and of all of you who have fallen in for the scam that Illuminati does not exist, they do, for the term Illuminati merely refers to the collective body of those who are illumined or enlightened. And they are the Illuminati. \"Ambition, however, personified by Typhon, knowing that temporal power must die if divine power, in the form of truth, be reestablished, put forth all its power again to scatter the doctrine, this time so thoroughly that it should never be rediscovered. If Typhon, as Plutarch has suggested, in one of his manifestations represents the sea, then it appears that this second destruction of Osiris may refer to the Atlantean deluge...\" [William Cooper]: There's Atlanta again. Atlantis, Atlanta, the same. Go to Atlanta, Georgia, folks. Drive around in that city. You will see pyramids everywhere. You will see 666 everywhere. You will see the symbols, the all ‐ seeing eye. \"...Osiris may refer to the Atlantean deluge by which the doctrine was swallowed or lost and its fragments scattered among all of the existing civilizations of that time. [And] the story continues. The body of Osiris, the Secret Doctrine, is divided into fourteen parts...\" 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And remember, Osiris was chopped into fourteen parts. They found all, save one: the phallus or the penis of Osiris. Well, the body of Osiris represents the Secret Doctrine. It's \"divided into fourteen parts and divided...among the parts of the world.\" And the Lost Word of Freemasonry is the generative force, the lost part of Osiris, the lost part, the secret of the Secret Doctrine. \"[So,] we must therefore understand that it was scattered through the seven divine and seven infernal spheres, the lokas and talas of India, or by different symbolism, through the seven worlds which are without and the seven worlds which are within [William Cooper: the Cabbala of the Jews]. Bacchus was torn into seven pieces by the Titans and Osiris into fourteen pieces. To use the words of Faber, 'Both these stories are in substance the same, for the second number is merely the reduplicate of the first. By a variation of much the same nature, the ancient mythologists added seven Titanides and seven Cabiri to the seven Titans.' \"The parts of Osiris were now scattered so hopelessly that ambitious Typhon [or the Titans] felt his authority to be secure at last. But Wisdom is not thus easily to be cheated. [William Cooper: Listen to this carefully, folks. This is their own words.] In the dark retreats of Islam, the Sufi explored the depths of Nature; among the Jews the learned Rabbins unravelled the intricate skein of Cabbalism; among the Greeks, Initiates rose to life through the nocturnal rituals of Eleusis; in Indian neophytes were brought to the contemplation of the triple ‐ headed Brahma at Elphanta and Ellora. Through the Middle Ages the alchemist in their retreats explored the infinite chemistry of existence, the Illuminati sought the pearl of great price, and Rosicrucian adepts sought to recast the molten sea. All these together were but Isis, still searching for the members of her lord. At last, according to the tradition, all these parts were restored again but one; but this one could not be returned.\" [William Cooper]: Now you understand why I tell you it's not the Jews, folks. If you're persecuting the Jews, you're making a big mistake. It is some of the Jews, it is some of the Catholics, it is some of the atheists, it is some of all the people of all of the nations and races and religions of the world. And outwardly, if they attend a church in your neighborhood and profess to believe in that religion, it is a lie. It is how they gain influence and power in that community, for they worship one god and one god only in the temple without windows. The headquarters of which, in this country, is exactly thirteen blocks from the White House. \"The Egyptian allegory tells us that the phallus of Osiris was swallowed by a fish. [Now, folks,] this is most significant and we may even infer mankind itself is the fish...\" [William Cooper]: But it even goes any further [sic], for this age has been known as the age of Pisces, the fish. The significant force and the power in the age Pisces was Christianity, and the fish actually referrers to Christianity. \"...the phallus being the symbol of the vital power of the Mystery School and so used in Egyptian hieroglyphics. The phallus, then, is the Lost Word [of Freemasonry] which is not discovered but for which a golden replica is substituted. In the Egyptian hieroglyphics the physical body, after the death of the soul or its departure therefrom, is called the khat [or K ‐ H ‐ A ‐ T], and the hieroglyphic for this is a fish. Thus the physical body of man is definitely tied up in symbolism with the creature which conceived son, Horus, a term concealing the collective body of the perfected adepts who were born again out of the womb swallowed the triple phallus of Osiris ‐‐ the threefold generative power. This golden phallus is the three ‐ lettered word of Freemasonry concealed under the letters A ‐ U ‐ M.\" [William Cooper]: And all of those of you in the New Age movement, or all of those of you who fell for all these gurus who came over here and taught you to sit and meditate, and while you were meditating, hum this: AUMMMM. A ‐ U ‐ M. (laughs) The golden phallus is the three ‐ lettered word of Freemasonry concealed under the letters A ‐ U ‐ M. How do you feel sheeple? And why to do these things? Because somebody tells you to. \"Isis, by thus modeling and reproducing the missing member of Osiris, gives the body of the god the appearance of completeness, but the life power [folks] is not there. Isis, the priesthood, with their initiatory process, had accomplished all that could be accomplished by natural philosophy. Therefore recourse is again had to magic. The golden phallus is rendered alive by the secret processes rescued from the lost Book of Thoth . Thus the divine power of Osiris is restored through the regeneration of the man himself and the processes of initiation. In the Greek system man was rendered divine because his composition contained the blood of Bacchus, [they believe] and in Egypt, because it contained the seminal power of Osiris. The institutions raised in the world to perpetuate the deeper truths of life [according to them] labored on through the centuries seeking for the lost key (the living Crux Ansata) which, if rediscovered, would enliven and impregnate the whole world and restore the good king Osiris to the throne left empty by his cruel death. \"The purpose of the Isiac Rite, is therefore, revealed is twofold. The first motive was the almost hopeless effort made by the bereaved Isis to restore her husband to life. She hovers above his corpse in the form of a bird, trying to restore his breath by the fluttering of her own wings. The ceremony is concealed in the Book of the Respirations . The causing of Osiris to breathe again is the great abstract ideal. The second and more imminent motive which actuated Isis was to avenge herself upon Typhon [William Cooper: Christianity] and destroy his power over world. This she determined to accomplish through her immaculately conceived son, Horus, [which is] a term concealing the collective body of the perfected adepts who were born again out of the womb of the Mother ‐‐ Isis, the Mystery School. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"\"[Now,] we can apply this analogy to a great modern system of initiation, [called] Freemasonry, which has certainly perpetuated it at least the outer form of the ancient rites [William Cooper: to the profane or to the members on the lower rung of the initiatory ladder. To the adepts of the priesthood, the higher initiates, then it is clear. You see, for] Freemasonry as an institution is Isis, the Mother of Mysteries, form whose dark womb the Initiates are born in the mystery of the second or philosophic birth. Thus all adepts, by virtue of their participation in the rites, are figuratively, at least, the Sons of Isis. As Isis is the widow, seeking to restore her lord, and to avenge his cruel murder, it follows that all Master Masons or Master builders, are widow's sons. They are the offspring of the institution widowed by the loss of the living Word, and theirs is the eternal quest ‐‐ they discover by becoming. \"In the Egyptian rites Horus is the saviour ‐ avenger, son of Isis, conceived by magic [or the ritual] after the brutal murder of Osiris. Hence, he is the posthumous redeemer. Freemasons are Hori, they are the eye of Osiris, whose body therefore, is made up of eyes. Each Initiate is a Horus, each is a hawk of the sun [spelled S ‐ U ‐ N], and for one reason is each raised and that is that he may join the army which is to avenge the destruction of wisdom, and restore the reign of the all ‐ seeing lord [William Cooper: Lucifer]. Each one is dedicated to the over ‐ throwing of the reign of Christianity [*note: book says Typhon]. The great battle, in which the sons of the hawk rout out the hosts of darkness, is the mysterious Armageddon of Revelation...\" [William Cooper]: You see, they believe Lucifer is the god of light and Jehovah, or Yahweh, is the god of darkness. \"[They believe that the Armageddon of Revelation is] the Kurukshetra of the Mahabharata and the Ragnarok of the Eddas. In this battle the host of the Adversary shall be routed forever. \"The great purposes of the Osirian rite are thus revealed in an unsuspected clarity. The Hershesti are philosophically opposed to the reign of ambition. It is their duty to reestablish that Golden Age when wisdom, personified as Osiris ‐‐ and not selfishness, personified by Typhon ‐‐ shall dictate the whole course of human procedure. The day must ultimately come when the Hori, by virtue of their royal purpose, (laughs) accomplish the consummation of the Great Work.\" [William Cooper]: The Great Work, folks, is the elevation of man to the illumined man, or 666, in the establishment of a one ‐ world totalitarian socialist Utopia on earth. \"The missing Word will be found and the golden substitute will be replaced as promised in the ancient rite. Osiris will rise in splendor from the dead and rule the world through those sages and philosophers with whom wisdom has been has become incarnate. \"It should be particularly noted that the Egyptians do not regard Osiris as wholly dead, but viewing him as continuing to live in the underworld where he superintends the ceremony of the psychostasia. The underworld is not the sphere of the dead alone; it is the world of the Mysteries. [William Cooper: Lucifer] is therefore god of the hidden fane, the temple which is beneath the earth, the house of the low celling, the crypts into which the Initiates go in search of truth. He is the Dweller who abides in the darkness of the innermost. His throne is not in the objective world but in that subjective sphere which is the inner life of man. [They believe that] thus is it arcanely intimated that while truth may perish from society, it cannot die from a heart which preserves the sacred tradition through that natural inspiration by which all men are gradually moved to truth. \"In the meantime the widow Isis, the Mystery School, continues to produce out of herself the host of potential redeemers. Spiritual education continues from age to age [in secret], and though temporarily obscured in this generation or in that, its onward process [they believe] is inevitable. Out of the Hidden House, guarded by the silent god, must some day issue the glorious and illumined Horus, [William Cooper: 666 is the number of that man] the very incarnation of his own father [Osiris or Lucifer], the personification of the lord of Abydos, the avenger of all...and the just god in whom there is no death.\" [William Cooper does commercial for the Pilot Connection] Good night, and God bless you all.

That’s Monday, March 15th, 8pm to 11, the Lafayette Hotel, 2223 El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego. I’m going to be giving a lecture that night, entitled \"The Sacrificed King,\" and I will prove to you, beyond any shadow of any doubt, that John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the religion known as \"Mystery Babylon.\" Specifically, by the arm of Mystery Babylon that calls itself the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. I will prove it to you folks. I want to see you. I want to meet you. I want to shake your hand. I want to see who my radio audience is. If you’re a CAJI (Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence) member, I specifically, really, really look forward to meeting CAJI members. You are my heroes. You are the ones who do the dirty work, who are constantly digging out and sending in information. So if you’re a CAJI member, I want to meet you, I want to see you, I want to shake your hand.

The price of admission is $40. If you’re a CAJI member, it’s $30. CAJI members get a 25% discount to this lecture. Sometimes CAJI members get a bigger discount, but this was all I was able to negotiate with the promoters of this event in San Diego. By the way, I will be there all weekend. I will be there the 13th, 14th and 15th. Actually, I will be there the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th. I’ll have a room at the hotel. If you want to come earlier, I’d like to meet you. I’d like to sit down and talk to you. I plan on having some conferences with some good people, some patriots, in my room. And you’ll get to meet my wife and my little daughter Pooh. They’re both looking forward to meeting you also. So, please, put it on your calendar. Start saving your money. Make sure that you are there. It is important. Now at the same time in this hotel the \"National New Age and Truth About UFOs\" conference is going on, so if you are interested and into this nutty, loony tunes stuff, you might want to come down and go to some of that too. Now some of these speakers have something to say. Most of them, however, are as nutty as a fruitcake, and so is what they say. I know. I’ve been to many of these. I’ve talked to these people so many times it’s pathetic. I’ve sat in and listened to them, and you talk about lies and deception and just plain old bullshit (laughs), you hear a lot of it at these conferences. But don’t get me wrong folks, because sometimes it’s a lot of fun. I mean, sometimes loony tunes is just fun. Escape from the real world a little while and listen to some of these people.

Something is destroying everything that we’ve ever held dear in this country. What is it? Well, if you’ve been listening to this show, many of you already know what it is. If you’ve just been listening to this show for a little while, you may have some idea, but you’re not quite really sure yet what’s going on. Well, I’m going to tell you right now it’s all about religion. Whether you’re religious or not, doesn’t make any difference. It’s all about religion. Whether you believe in God or not, it doesn’t make any difference. It’s all about a big battle between good and evil. And most of it, I got to tell you, exists in the minds of men. Some of it’s real. The question is, what’s real, what’s deception, what should we be paying any attention to? What is it that’s driving us insane? Yes, something is wrong in America. [plays audio of trailer for the 1960 movie, La machera del demonio , a.k.a.

Why are all of the legacies of the past, the family, national borders, the right to practice any chosen religion, the right to private property, amongst other things, under such an attack? Is it possible that there are actually people and organizations who really want to change the basic order of things?\" [William Cooper]: Well, my regular listeners know the answer to that. \"Clues to the answers to these questions[, folks,] can be gleaned from some comments made by people and organizations that are talking about these wide ‐ ranging changes in the nature of our lifestyle. \"An Associated Press dispatch on July the 26th, 1968 reported [this]: 'New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller says as President he would work toward international creation of \"a new world order\"...'\" [William Cooper]: And you thought George Bush coined that phrase? Surprise, surprise. \"On January the 30th, 1976, a new document called The Declaration of Interdependence was introduced to the American people. [And] it was signed by [124 traitors:] 32 Senators and 92 Representatives [altogether 124 traitors] in Washington D.C. and [it] read in part: 'Two centuries ago our forefathers brought forth a new nation. Now we must join with others to bring forth a new world order.'\" [William Cooper]: And you thought George Bush coined that phrase? Surprise, surprise. \"Another individual who has commented is Henry Kissinger, [William Cooper: probably the greatest traitor this nation has ever known,] former Secretary of State. According to the Seattle Post Intelligence of April 18th, 1975, Mr. Kissinger said: 'Our nation is uniquely endowed to play a creative and decisive role in the new order which is taking form around us.' \"...George Bush gave the commencement address at Texas A&M University on May 12th, 1989, and he used similar words as well. His speech was on the subject of Soviet ‐ American relations, and he was quoted as saying, in part: 'Ultimately our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union back into the world order. Perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nations.' \"Historian Walter Mills maintained that prior to World War I, Colonel Edward Mandell House, the major advisor to Woodrow Wilson, the President at the time, had a hidden motive for involving America in the war. The historian wrote [this]: 'The Colonel’s sole justification for preparing such a batch of blood for his countrymen was his hope of establishing a New World Order of peace and security.'\" [William Cooper]: You see how these people fool themselves? (laughs) They always say that the end is peace and security, a world Utopia. But to get it, they spill more blood than ever has been spilled in history. Each time they try to bring about their utopia, the blood runs in the streets. They’re liars. They’re hypocrites. They’re manipulators, deceivers. They are the worshipers of Lucifer. \"Adolf Hitler, a Socialist, and the head of the German government prior to and during the nation’s involvement in World War II, is quoted 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"as saying [this]: 'National socialism will use its own revolution for the establishing of a new world order.' [William Cooper: Adolf Hitler was a Socialist. \"Nazi\" means National Socialism.] Hitler confided to Hermann Rauschning, the President of the Danzig Senate, 'National Socialism is more than a religion; it is the will to create superman.'\" [William Cooper]: And what is the number of the man? 666. You see, in the New World Order, only one man will be allowed to live ‐‐ the new man, the illumined man, and the number of that man is 666. You will see that number increasingly all around you. You will also begin to see pyramids increasingly all around you, and the eye in the pyramid, and the eye alone. And you will see circles with the dot in the center. And you will see obelisks appearing all over the place. And these are not the only signs. There are many, many, many more. They are the signs of the religion Mystery Babylon. \"Hitler added this thought: 'Well, yes! We are barbarians, and barbarians we wish to remain. It does us honor. It is we who will rejuvenate the world. The present world is near its end. Our only task is to sack it.' \"Another book on his background quoted his comments that his Nazi...party had a hidden purpose, one that was not perceived by the world at large. Mr. Hitler was quoted as saying [this]: 'He who has seen in National Socialism only a political movement has seen nothing.' [William Cooper: For it is a religion.] \"The Humanist religion issued a manifesto in 1933 stating its beliefs about the world in general. It took the following position about the need for the wealthy governments to share their wealth with the less fortunate nations: 'It is the moral obligation of the developed nations to provide ‐‐ through an international authority ‐‐ ...economic assistance...to the developing portions of the globe.'\" [William Cooper]: Now that is a lie, folks. It means that it's OK for some of us to lay back and do nothing and reap the rewards of the labor of others. That’s socialism! That’s what it’s all about. Communism, socialism...it’s the same. And these people, the worshipers of Mystery Babylon, are the original Communists. They are international socialism. They invented it. It is their creation. It is their dream of a world Utopia ‐‐ a one ‐ world, totalitarian socialist government. \"The April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs , the quarterly periodical issued by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, had an article in it by Richard N. Gardner, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations in the Lyndon Johnson and John Kennedy administrations. [And] he stated [this]: 'We are likely to do better by building our \"house of world order\" from bottom up rather than from the top down...an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, is likely to get us to world order faster than the old ‐ fashioned assault.' \"Even the Communist Party is voicing similar thoughts. The People’s Daily World for Thursday, March 9th, 1989, contained an article written by Angela Davis. [William Cooper: You remember her?] Those familiar with Ms. Davis will remember that she was the Vice Presidential candidate for the Communist Party a few years ago. She currently is a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States [and she] is quoted in the paper as saying: 'One underlying effect of anti ‐ communism in this respect is to encourage a certain hesitancy to embrace solutions which call for deep, structural, socio ‐ economic transformation.' \"Another Communist, Alexei Kovylov, spoke at an evening meeting held at Windstar, Colorado in August 1985, and gave the participants in attendance a surprise presentation. He spoke about the 12th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscow a few months prior to his lecture. He said: 'There were three programs. The first was political and dealt with the various issues of peace and disarmament. The second was dedicated to environmental [issues] and to the new international economic order.' \"The alleged need for a change in the basic way things are done is consistent with the teachings of the 'Father of Communism,' Karl Marx.\" [William Cooper]: He’s not really the father of Communism, but it’s a name that’s been tagged onto him. You see, he was just a hack writer hired by the Mystery Religion of Babylon to write the Communist Manifesto. It was not his idea, but he’s reaped the benefits of it, if you can call them benefits. \"[But] he co ‐ authored the Communist Manifesto with Frederick Engels, another hack writer, in 1848. Mr. Marx wrote that the Communists: 'openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.' \"Nesta Webster, a writer on the subject of conspiratorial organizations in the past, wrote this in her book, entitled Secret Societies : 'The revolution desired by the leaders [of world revolution] is a moral and spiritual revolution, an anarchy of ideas by which all standards set up throughout nineteen centuries shall be reversed, all honored traditions trampled under foot, and above all [above all] the Christian ideal finally obliterated.' 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"\"Some of the Catholic Popes in the past have commented on the major changes coming in the future. One such Pope was Pope Pius XI, who wrote the following in 1937: 'Communism has behind it occult forces for which a long time have been working for the overthrow of the Christian Social Order.' \"One of the Popes who preceded him, Pope Pius XI, oh excuse me, Pope Pius IX, wrote this in November, 1846 about the changes that he saw in the future: 'That infamous doctrine of so ‐ called communism...is absolutely contrary to the natural law itself, and if once adopted, would utterly destroy the rights, property and possessions of all men, and even society itself.'\" [William Cooper]: Now, don’t get all worked up about what the Pope says, because they have succeeded now, with this Pope, in putting one of their own upon the throne of the Vatican. It had long been their dream, and now it is true. And the bans have been lifted against Catholics joining secret societies. And many of the hierarchy of the Vatican belong to the secret societies: the Freemasons, Propaganda Due ['P2'], etc., etc., etc. You will find an obelisk (chuckles) ‐‐ the symbol of the phallus, the penis of Osiris ‐‐ in the Vatican courtyard. You don’t believe me? Go look. \"Another individual who wrote about the future was Dr. José Argüelles of an organization known as the Planet Art Network. Dr. Argüelles wrote, 'Also implicit in all these events is a call for another way of life, another way of doing things...a redistribution of global wealth...in short, a New World Order.' \"[Now,] just what the future society was that these people are talking about was described, in a brief manner, by Marilyn Ferguson in her book, entitled The Aquarian Conspiracy . [And] she wrote [this]: 'The new world is the old ~ transformed.' \"Another clue about what is in store for the future world was offered by Dr. James H. Billington, who received his doctorate as a Rhodes...\" [William Cooper]: Rhodes, Rhodes, Rhodes, Rhodes Scholar. Where have you heard that before? You have a Rhodes Scholar sitting in the Oval Office right now! \"[He] received his doctorate as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and has taught at Harvard and Princeton Universities. He wrote this in his book, entitled Fire in The Minds of Men : 'This book seeks to trace the origins of a faith ‐ perhaps the faith of our time. What is new is the belief that a perfect secular...order will emerge from the forcible overthrow of traditional authority.'\" [William Cooper]: You hear that? They believe a perfect, secular order will emerge. Nothing perfect will ever emerge from the minds of imperfect men, and no men will ever be ruled by other imperfect men in any kind of a perfect Utopian order, secular or otherwise. That is why we must be eternally vigilant...eternally vigilant. \"That these future changes would involve force and slavery was confirmed by B.F. Skinner, chairman of the Psychology Department at Harvard University, in his book, entitled Beyond Freedom and Dignity . Dr. Skinner has been called '...the most influential of living American psychologists' by Time magazine. So the world should listen to the professor when he speaks. The magazine told the reader what the message of Professor Skinner’s book was: 'We can no longer afford freedom, and so it must be replaced with control over man, his conduct, and his culture.' [William Cooper]: Not long ago in the Los Angeles Times there was an article called \"Ten Forecasts for the Coming Decade,\" and one of these was chemical, or electronic, implants to control individual behavior on a twenty ‐ four hour basis. \"Another student of these changes is Alvin Toffler, who wrote this in his book, entitled The Third Wave [William Cooper: and you should read everything he’s written, by the way, because what he’s writing is what is coming]: 'A new civilization is emerging in our lives...This new civilization brings with it new family styles, changed ways of working, loving and living; a new economy; new political conflicts; and beyond all this an altered consciousness as well. The dawn of this new civilization is the single most explosive fact of our lifetimes.' \"Another scientist involved in commenting upon the future changes was Dr. Carl Sagan [and he’s] observed [this]: 'It’s clear that sometime relatively soon in terms of the lifetime of the human species people will identify with the entire planet and the species...' \"[Now] the reason[, folks,] why these changes are necessary was explained by Manly P. Hall, perhaps the world’s leading authority on esoteric words and language. [William Cooper: He was a 33rd degree Freemason.] He wrote in his book, entitled Lectures on Ancient Philosophy : 'The time has not yet arrived when the average man is strong enough or wise enough to rule himself.' \"And he explained who he considered worthy enough to rule those on the world considered by the experts to be incapable of governing themselves. He wrote this: 'Never will peace reign upon the earth until we are ruled by the fit.'\" 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And who is the fit? (laughs) Why, them of course ‐‐ the illumined, the priests of the Mystery Religion of Babylon. \"Mr. Hall even indicated that these changes would occur soon. He wrote this comment in his book previously cited: 'One hundred years ago [meaning in 1884 [folks]] it was predicted that within a few centuries men would revert to the gods of Plato and Aristotle...We may all look forward with eager anticipation to that nobler day when the gods of philosophy once more shall rule the world...' \"Aldous Huxley in his book, called Brave New World Revisited , quotes a character called the Grand Inquisitor in one of Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski’s parables as saying [this]: 'In the end they [the people] will lay their freedom at our [the controllers'] feet and say to us, \"Make us your slaves, but feed us.\"' \"The Tucson Citizen newspaper of November the 3rd, 1988 printed a photograph of a group of people involved in a 'march for literacy,' and it clearly demonstrated that at least some people in America are now asking their government to make them their slaves. The picture showed a demonstrator carrying a picket sign that read: 'Uncle Sam, we want you to support us.' \"Mr. Huxley gave us a date when we could expect these changes to occur. He wrote the following in his book, written in 1958: '...The twenty ‐ first century...will be the era of World Controllers.' \"And then he told us why these controllers would not fail: 'The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles and mysteries. Under a scientific dictatorship education will really work ~ with the result that most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be overthrown.' \"Someone who might have given the world the date for the commencement of these predicted changes was Zbigniew Brzezinski, [a Marxist and] President Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor during his four year administration. [And] he wrote the following in his book, entitled Between Two Ages [William Cooper: by the way, you should read every book that he’s every written...you will be angered]: 'Either 1976 or 1989 ‐‐ the two hundredth anniversary of the Constitution ‐‐ could serve as a suitable target date for culminating a national dialogue on the relevance of existing arrangements, the workings of the representative process, and the desirability of imitating the various European regionalization reforms and of streamlining the administrative structure.' [William Cooper: And it did begin exactly when he said it would.] \"So, the people of the world can now determine what those changes are that those in the positions of implementing changes have in store for them. In summary, [folks,] these changes are: \"The old world is coming to an end. It will be replaced with a new way of doing things. The new world will be called the 'New World Order.' This new structuring will re ‐ distribute property from the 'have' nations and will give it to the 'have not' nations. The New World Order will include changes in the family...the workplace...religion. \"The United States will play a major role in bringing it to the world. World wars have been fought to further its aims. \"Adolf Hitler, the Nazi Socialist, supported the goal of the planners. The majority of the people will not readily accept 'the new world order' but will be deceived into accepting it by two strategies: \"1. Those in favor of the changes will have become seated in the very thrones of power, generally without the public realizing that fact [William Cooper: and this has already occurred]. \"2. The 'old world order' will be destroyed piece by piece by a series of planned 'nibbles' at the established format. \"The Communist Party is actively supporting the changes to the 'new world order.' The basic tenets of Christianity, which were the base for the 'old world order,' will have to be eliminated. \"If the slower, methodical techniques of change do not function, violence will be introduced and controlled by the planners [William Cooper: including, possibly, a World War III using atomic weapons]. The people of the world will give up their freedom to the 'controllers' because there will be a planned famine, or some other serious occurrence such as a depression or war. \"The change to the 'New World Order' is coming shortly[, folks, and it has already begun]. However, if that is not the [case], it will be introduced, one step at a time, so that the entire structure will be in place by the year 1999.\" [William Cooper]: We’ve got to take a short break. Don’t go away, folks. I’ll be right back after this very short pause. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"(break music: audio of trailer from the 1959 movie, The Mummy ) [continuing reading from The New World Order , by A. Ralph Epperson]: \"[Yes folks,] something is indeed wrong in America! And many sense that changes in this nation’s lifestyle are occurring.\" [William Cooper]: Most of us know full well that these changes are taking place. \"The newspapers are saturated with articles reporting the activities of those advocating increased governmental spending for a variety of unconstitutional purposes; organizations supporting a globalism concept urge the world to adopt a one ‐ world government; psychologists preaching the destruction of the family unit and recommending that the society rear the nation’s children; governments closing private schools; and nations forming regional governments under which national borders are scheduled to disappear.\" [William Cooper]: And, still, the sheeple think that all of this is happening by accident, and any concept that it is being brought about by a carefully orchestrated plan is the product of crazy conspiratorialists (mmm ‐ hmm). \"Since these changes appear to be part of the new philosophy known as 'the new world order,' anyone desiring to know the future has to become familiar with this new phrase and what it portends for the world of tomorrow.\" [William Cooper]: And you will quickly see that is the result of a well ‐ thought out, well ‐ conceived, and well ‐ orchestrated plan. Indeed, it is called the \"Great Work.\" \"As an indication that major changes are coming in tomorrow’s world, one of the current trends mentioned is the call for a 'one ‐ world government'. [And] one of those supporting this leap forward is Norman Cousins, President of the World Federalist Society. And he is on record as saying [this]: 'World government is coming. In fact, it is inevitable. No arguments for it or against it can change that fact.'\" [William Cooper]: And I say, that is a lie. Two hundred and forty million Americans standing up in concert with each other, holding a rifle in their hands, can stop it instantly in its tracks. And that’s the truth of why we were given the 2nd article and amendment to the Constitution. It has nothing to do with hunting or preserving your private property. It has to do with preserving our freedom. \"The goal of a one ‐ world government[, folks,] is not a new thought. One of the earliest formal organizations that supported the concept of that goal was the Illuminati, founded on May 1st, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt [William Cooper: a Jesuit priest, a professor at Ingolstadt University, a Jesuit university, a teacher of Canon Law]...Professor Weishaupt was quoted as saying [this]: 'It is necessary to establish a universal regime and empire over the whole world...'\" [William Cooper]: Now, let me tell you the truth about the Illuminati. Adam Weishaupt did not establish the Illuminati, nor did the Illuminati die with Adam Weishaupt. Make sure you understand that. \"A more modern organization that supports the coming changes is the Masonic Order called simply the Freemasons, or [for short] the Masons. [William Cooper: It has nothing to do with bricklayers, folks. The term originally comes from the French frère ‐ maçon , which literally means, 'the sons of light.'] This worldwide fraternity has members in America, as will be discussed, and they, too, support a call for a one ‐ world government. One who has written about this secret organization is Paul Fisher, and he says this about them in his book, entitled Behind the Lodge Door : 'Masonry will eventually rule the world.' (laughs) [William Cooper: Benevolent fraternal organization?] \"Albert Pike [William Cooper: and you’re going to hear an awful lot about Albert Pike during this series] the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry here in the United States from 1850 to 1891 [William Cooper: the man who founded the Ku Klux Klan and B’nai B’rith] wrote a book, entitled Morals and Dogma . [William Cooper: And when and if you can find that book, don’t pass it up ‐‐ buy it and read it.] Mr. Pike has been praised by his fellow Masons as a member almost without parallel in the history of the Masonic Order. [William Cooper: He was a great friend of Giuseppe Mazzini, the ruler of the European branch of the Illuminati.] Carl Claudy, himself a Masonic writer of great esteem, wrote this about Pike: 'Albert Pike, one of the greatest geniuses Freemasonry has ever known. He was a mystic, a symbolist, a teacher of the hidden truths of Freemasonry. \"So the outsider can know that whenever Mr. Pike speaks he speaks with authority and knowledge. He is perhaps the greatest Masonic writer of all time [William Cooper: and I would add, next to Manly P. Hall]. \"His book is given to each Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction Freemason, who is asked to read it. (There seems to be a difference of 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"opinion as to whether or not this book is still required reading for each Scottish Rite Mason. [As we were] told that it was given to each Scottish Rite Mason in Tucson. Other Masons say that that is not true.)\" [William Cooper]: But you have to remember, they’re sworn not to reveal the secrets of the lodge, and therefore you can never trust them to tell you the truth, no matter what they’re telling you. \"[But in this book, Morals and Dogma , Pike] informs the new Mason about the moral teachings of the Masonic Lodge. He instructs the Masonic reader that the Order will eventually be asked to rule the entire globe. And he wrote [this]: 'The world will soon come to us for its Sovereigns...and Pontiffs...We shall constitute the equilibrium of the universe and be rulers over the masters of the world.' \"He wrote this supportive statement in a book, entitled Legenda : 'And thus the warfare against the powers of evil that crushed the Order of the Temple goes steadily on, and Freedom marches ever onward toward the conquest of the world.' [William Cooper]: Reference to the Order of the Temple is reference to the Knights Templars, who were destroyed in concert by King Philip of France and Pope Clement V. And the \"powers of evil,\" referred to in this paragraph, is the Christian Church ‐‐ the Christian religion, Christianity as a whole. [William Cooper]: Let me read it to you again, just in case you weren’t paying attention. \"And thus the warfare against the powers of evil that crushed the Order of the Temple goes steadily on, and freedom marches ever onward toward the conquest of the world.\" \"The Order of the Temple Mr. Pike was writing about was the Knights Templar which was, according to him: 'devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara [the Pope’s triple crown] and the crowns of Kings.' [William Cooper]: Well, then, is it any wonder that the King of France and the Pope crushed the Templars in France? For that is the only place that they were truly crushed. \"Mr. Pike said that the Catholic Church was a 'power of evil' because it had 'crushed' the Templars, even though he admitted that they were 'devoted' to opposition to the Church and its leader, the Pope. \"But the major point of that quote is that these forces of opposition, presumably meaning the Masons, are marching 'onward towards the conquest of the world.' Mr. Pike repeated his devotion to the conquest of the world with this comment at the end of his book, entitled Morals and Dogma : 'Such, my Brother, is the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason; such the true ROYAL SECRET, which makes possible, and shall at length make real, the HOLY EMPIRE of true Masonic Brotherhood.' [William Cooper]: Now, all of you Master Masons out there who have been writing me letters, don’t write to me anymore. You are my enemies, and if I can, I will destroy you. Don’t write to me and profess your innocence, for your own have proclaimed your guilt. And if you are truly innocent, then you are just a foolish dupe, and you better get out while you can. \"...the major worldwide movement that champions a one world government[, folks,] under a religious leader, is a new phenomena occurring worldwide called, 'The New Age Movement.'\" [William Cooper]: a creation of Freemasonry. The newspaper put out by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is called The New Age . \"Texe Marrs, a researcher into this new religion, has written two books on the subject. Both of these books are excellent primers for those who wish to know more about the beliefs of this religion. The two books are entitled Dark Secrets of the New Age and Mystery Mark of the New Age . He has written: 'The New Age movement has undeniably taken on the definite form of a religion, [William Cooper: Of course, because it is Mystery Babylon! He goes on to say] complete with an agreed ‐ upon body of doctrine, printed scripture, a pattern of worship and ritual, a functioning group of ministers and lay leaders.' \"Another writer who has written two books on the New Age religion is Constance Cumbey. Her two books are called The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow and A Planned Deception . She has written this: 'The New Age movement is a religion complete with its own Bibles, prayers and mantras, Vatican City/Jerusalem equivalents, priests and gurus, born ‐ again experiences (they call it ‘rebirthing’), spiritual laws and commandments, psychics and prophets, and nearly every other indicia of a religion.' \"The new religion has a series of leaders. One is a woman named Alice Bailey, a prolific writer on the subject of the New Age. She was the founder of an organization called the Arcane School, one of the major Lucis Trust divisions. The Lucis Trust was a major publisher of books supporting the religion [William Cooper: and published a newsletter, or newspaper, called Lucifer ]. In her book, entitled The Externalization of the Hierarchy , she told her readers who the organizations were that were going to bring the New Age religion to the world, and she identified them as being: 'the three main channels through which the preparation for the New Age is going on might be 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"regarded as the Church, the Masonic Fraternity, and the educational field.'\" [William Cooper]: And, folks, that is exactly who is bringing it to realization. \"(The main thrust of this program is going to be to examine only one of the three organizations mentioned by Alice Bailey, that being the Masonic Fraternity. There are numerous works by other writers[, lecturers, researchers] exposing the involvement of the Church and the educational field in the New Age movement [and in the New World Order], so I’m not going to attempt to duplicate those efforts. However, only a few are aware of the involvement of the [Freemasons], and that is why I have chosen to concentrate on that organization[, Mystery Babylon].) [William Cooper]: And the reason I’m concentrating on that organization is because it is their members who have infiltrated the Church and the educational field who control those other two organizations. So, really, there’s only one organization that needs to be dealt with, and that is Freemasonry. \"Another major writer on the New Age movement is Benjamin Creme, and he admitted in his book, entitled The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of Wisdom that: 'The new religion will manifest, for instance, through organizations like Masonry. In Freemasonry is embedded the core of the secret of the occult Mysteries.' \"So Masonry conceals a great mystery inside its temples, one that is connected somehow to the New Age movement. The Masons admit in some of their writings that they too are anticipating a new age, a series of major changes. Henry Clausen, the past Sovereign Grand Commander (the equivalent of their President) of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, has been quoted as saying [this]: 'We look towards a transforming into a New Age using, however, the insight and wisdom of the ancient mystics.' \"The Masons claim that the things that they believe in are as old as the ancient civilizations. They also claim that these 'mystics,' the ancient philosophers, had the wisdom of all ages, and that somehow this knowledge has become lost through the centuries. Humanity today does not possess this knowledge, but it has become the task of the Masons and other 'truth' seekers [William Cooper: who turn out in every case of investigation to be liars, deceivers, and manipulators] to rediscover these principles for the benefit of all mankind. Those possessing this knowledge will correct the world’s current problems. Some of the Masons also claim to have identified the cause of these problems. \"One of the most prolific writers on the subject of this 'lost' truth [as I have mentioned earlier] is Manly P. Hall, a 33rd degree Mason. \"(For those unfamiliar with the Masonic degrees, all Masons in America start through what is called the Blue Lodge, consisting of only three degrees...)\" [William Cooper]: A Master Mason is of the third degree, and really knows nothing even though he thinks that he has been illumined. And I get letters from them all the time: \"I’m a Master Mason and I never heard of any of the stuff that you’re talking about!\" (laughs) Oh boy! I ‐‐ it amazes me, folks, it just absolutely amazes me that people are so stupid! Drives me wild. \"(...The initiate into the Blue Lodge goes through three separate and different initiation ceremonies, one for each degree. After completing these ceremonies, he may stay where he is or choose to affiliate himself with either the York Rite [William Cooper: which has thirteen degrees] or the Scottish Rite [which has thirty ‐ two and then the meritorious 33rd]. The latter is divided into two separate jurisdictions, the Southern and the Northern. These are based primarily on state borders, and whether one joins one or the other depends on where the initiate lives. The two Scottish rites have an additional twenty ‐ nine degrees, making for a total of thirty ‐ two. There is one more degree, called the 33rd degree, which is honorary, and only a few are invited into that degree...)\" [William Cooper]: And to even be considered, they must perform some major work toward the completion of the great work, which is the plan to bring about the Utopia on earth ‐‐ the socialist dream. \"(...The York Rite has a total of nine degrees. However, since little has been revealed about this order, we will concentrate on only the Scottish Rite, and, in particular, the Southern Jurisdiction.)\" [William Cooper]: Well, I’ve since discovered that the York Rite has a total of thirteen degrees, folks, not just nine. \"Mr. Hall has written a book, entitled Lectures on Ancient Philosophy , in which he talks a great deal about the Masonic fraternity. This is his comment about the coming changes: 'A new day is dawning for Freemasonry. From the insufficiency of theology and the hopelessness of materialism, men are turning to seek the god of philosophy.' \"Notice that Mr. Hall has said that current 'theology', obviously current 'religion', has proven insufficient. Also, he feels that 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"'materialism,' meaning the right to private property, is also a failure. But more importantly, he points out that this new 'God' of the Freemasons is somehow different from the God of the Jews and Christians. As will be illustrated later, some of the Masons believe that the God of the Bible is a God of evil. \"Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, perhaps the founder of the current New Age movement, has also determined that the Masons are somehow supportive of her religious views. She wrote this in her book, entitled The Secret Doctrine : '...at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries many Freemasons travelled to Tibet where they were initiated into the esoteric [defined as intended for or understood by only a chosen few, as an inner group of disciples or initiates] by an esoteric order of the Masters of wisdom.' \"It should be expected that she would support the Masonic fraternity. In 1875, she founded an organization called the Theosophical Society, basically dedicated to teaching the world about her new secret religion. One of the earliest members of that organization was Albert Pike, later to become the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. \"Albert Pike, who later became a 33rd degree Mason, the highest degree attainable, also saw that there were some significant changes coming, and that he was supportive of those changes. He wrote the following in his book, entitled Morals and Dogma : 'We can look on all the evils of the world and see that it is only the hour before sunrise, and that the light is coming.' \"[Now,] if Mr. Hall is right, the 'evils' that his fellow Mason Albert Pike saw are connected to current religion, and that which is coming is somehow different from these religious views. Mr. Hall, who as mentioned previously is another 33rd degree Mason, also wrote that a new day was coming, and that it was not too far into the future: 'A new light is breaking in the east [the significance of the location, 'the east', [I have already] pointed out [William Cooper: ‐‐ it is the point where the sun rises]] a more glorious day is at hand. The rule of the philosophic elect ~ the dream of the ages ‐‐ will yet be realized and is not too far distant.' \"So, Mr. Hall is also expecting that these changes are about to occur in the not too distant future. \"Someone who attempted to zero in on when these changes were expected to occur was Alice Bailey, previously mentioned. She wrote about when she thought the New Age would arrive: 'Eventually, there will appear the Church Universal, and its definite outlines will appear towards the close of the century.' [William Cooper]: And you have already seen the emergence of the Universalist Church. \"Since she wrote early in the 20th century, we can see that she was predicting the eventual arrival of the New Age, sometime around the 1990s. This estimate of that date is not too far wrong, as will be demonstrated later [in this series of programs]. \"Whatever is coming in the future, some New Agers have told us that they expect that it will last for a long time. One such writer is Ruth Montgomery, who wrote that she saw that the new religion would rule the earth for a thousand years. She wrote the following in her book, entitled Herald For The New Age : 'The New Age, the millennium [a millennium is a period of one thousand years], will see an end to that strife, at least for a thousand years.' \"[Now,] just what is the New Age religion that will last for at least one thousand years on the earth? [William Cooper: What is it?] \"One who attempted to answer that question was Constance Cumbey in her book, entitled The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow . She wrote that these were the basic tenets of the new religion [William Cooper: Listen closely]: \"1. 'The Plan' for the future includes the installation of a New World 'Messiah', the implementation of a new world government and new world religion under Maitreya (an individual who will be examined later in this [series of programs]). \"2. A universal credit card system will be implemented [as a cashless society]. \"3. A world food authority will control all of the world’s food supply. \"4. A universal tax. \"5. A universal draft [and] \"6. They intend on utterly rooting out people who believe the Bible and worship God and to completely stamp out Christianity [from the face of this earth]. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"\"As was discussed prior to this summary, certain people have indicated that they see the Catholic Church as an enemy. Here, Mrs. Cumbey says that they see not only Catholicism as the enemy, they also see all of Christianity as an enemy. \"Whatever the New Agers believe in[, folks,] it appears to be growing in popularity. Bantam Books, one of this nation’s leading publishing houses, has reported that the sales of their New Age titles has increased tenfold in the past decade. Time magazine reports that the number of New Age bookstores has doubled in the past five years to a total of about 2,500. According to an article in Forbes magazine: 'publishers estimate that total sales of New Age titles today are at least $100 million at retail.' \"So, whatever they believe in, many believe in it. \"But perhaps the most insightful comment about the nature of what the New Age religion believe in, and who they worshiped as their god, was written by Mrs. Cumbey in her book, entitled The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow . She wrote that they had: 'the intent of bringing about a New World Order ‐‐ an order that writes God out of the picture and deifies Lucifer.' \"So, if Mrs. Cumbey and the other writers on the subject are right, the New Age movement needs to be studied in some depth.\" [William Cooper]: We know that the goal of Freemasonry, at least that which is stated, is to bring about the new man, the illumined man. And the number of the man is 666.

(opening music: Hail, Hail, Rock and Roll , performed by Bart Simpson of The Simpsons and Buster Poindexter) [William Cooper advertises upcoming appearance in San Diego, asks for air time donations, and offers CAJI memberships] Folks, something is wrong in America, no doubt about it. There’s a new religion appearing. [reading from The New World Order , by Ralph Epperson]: \"[Many of you call it] the New Age religion [and it] appears to be the exact opposite of the Old Age religion, meaning the religion of the Jews and Christians.\" [William Cooper]: It’s not really that different. I’ve studied it, I’ve talked to people who practice it. They claim it's not a religion but it is. Christ has ceased to be to become a man, the son of God, the actual manifestation of God in the flesh on earth and has become the consciousness, the Christ consciousness. And anyone can be Christ if they have this Christ consciousness in the New Age religion. \"[Now,] these are the two religions [ ‐‐ the Christian religion and the Jewish religion ‐‐ ] that set the United States on its course because these religions taught that mankind had some basic human rights. They held that the family was the basic unit in all of the world; they believed in the right to private property; they believed in the unalienable ([which is] defined as being incapable of being surrendered) right to life; they held that each person had the right to worship their god; and they held that all had the right to freedom of association. As shall be so [disclosed during this series], these positions...were deemed to be 'self ‐ evident' by those who wrote the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, [and] became the cornerstones of the American civilization. (The term 'self ‐ evident' [folks] means that these human rights were not worthy of debate because they stood on their own, simply because they were true. They could not be debated [William Cooper: because they were Creator endowed, endowed by God].) \"Yet, [folks,] today, these cornerstones of American life are no longer 'self ‐ evident' [to many.] They are being publicly discussed: people and organizations are now debating whether an individual has the basic human rights to life, liberty and property. [William Cooper: There's a great danger in this.] \"Frederick Wilhelm Nietzsche, a German philosopher, and one of the teachers of many of the world’s leading communist revolutionaries [William Cooper: in international socialists], put the argument quite succinctly, in this statement: 'I condemn Christianity. I raise against the Christian Church the most terrible of all accusations that any accuser uttered. [That] is to me the highest conceivable corruption.'\" [William Cooper]: Remember, the priests, the Initiates of the Mystery Schools believe that Christianity is a corruption of the Mysteries, the worship of Lucifer, represented by the sun, the light, Osiris. \"Texe Marrs, an author who has written in opposition to the New Age, wrote this about their hatred of the Christians: 'The New Age believers told, \"You can be a god in the next instant if only those horrible Christians weren’t around with their poisonous attitudes.\"' \"That thought was illustrated by another of the important New Agers, David Spangler, who wrote this in his book, entitled Reflections on the Christ : 'We can take all the scriptures and all the teachings and all the tablets and all the laws and all the marshmallows and have a jolly good bonfire and marshmallow roast, because that is all they are worth.' 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"\"So, the New Age, like the Masons, feel that Christianity is the enemy, a force to be countered, not by open debate, but by contempt and ridicule and, as shall be illustrated later, by even murder.\" [William Cooper]: And, remember, the source of the New Age movement is the order of the Freemasons. \"Other parties wish to join the debate. In 1911, the Socialist Party of Great Britain published a pamphlet, entitled Socialism and Religion , in which they placed their position about religion into the arena: 'It is therefore a profound truth that Socialism is the natural enemy of religion. A Christian Socialist is in fact an anti ‐ Socialist. Christianity...is the antithesis of Socialism.' \"So the Socialist, the New Ager, and the Mason have declared war on the Christians. And, as in every war, the enemy must be defeated, even by bloodshed, if necessary. This war has deep roots in history and I will cover those roots so that you will understand it perfectly where this came from. This war is no different. Bloodshed is anticipated by all parties in the battle. \"Lavedi Lafferty and Bud Hollowell, two New Agers, started the discussion about how their religion sanctions the use of violence against the Christian community. They wrote the following in their book, entitled The Eternal Dance : 'This is a time of opportunity for those who will take it [[apparently] meaning the New Agers [the Initiates of the Mystery Religions, Socialists].] For others [apparently the Christians] if the earth is unsuitable for them [if they will not accept the New Age religion] they will go on to other worlds.'\" [William Cooper]: Which simply means they will be exterminated. You better listen to me, folks, I am a messenger and my message is unmistakable and it had better not fall upon deaf ears. For those deaf ears will be rendered dead, in the coming New World Order. \"Another New Age spokesman, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the 'guru' sought out by the rock 'n roll group known as the Beatles [and others], has been quoted as saying: \"There has not been and there will not be a place for the unfit...The fit will lead, and if the unfit are not coming along [if they will not accept the New Age religion] there is no place for them. \"'In the Age of Enlightenment, there is no place for ignorant people. Non ‐ existence of the unfit has been the law of nature.' \"Another example of New Age thinking on this vital issue came from a pamphlet available in a book store selling New Age material. It was published by something called the Guardian Actions Publications of New Mexico and it was entitled Cosmic Countdown . [This pamphlet] alleged that it had received these thoughts from something called 'Higher Intelligence,' and it directed its attention to the hunger/disease problem in the third world. [And] the pamphlet simply stated: 'The world should be forewarned to be on a lookout for diseases which have been suppressed for years, suddenly rearing their ugly heads and decimating the populations already on the verge of starvation in the Third World Nations. \"'Although these peoples will eventually be replaced by the new root race about to make its appearance in a newly cleansed world; nevertheless, for the moment, this is a tragedy.'\" [William Cooper]: You see, they have made incredible admissions, but none of you are looking, none of you are reading, none of you are absorbing. In fact, most of you are so stupid that you think that the only thing you should read is what you personally believe in or agree with. How can you exist in this world ignorant of the opinions and the writings and the thoughts of everyone else, including your enemies? \"The words reveal an incredible scenario: [you see, these] people in the Third World nations are going to be entirely replaced by [what they call] a 'new root race.' That eventuality will not be a tragedy; the tragedy is that these people are dying now due to starvation and disease...\" [William Cooper: But when they die later, or they're all gone and they're replaced by the new root race, that won’t be a tragedy. \"The concept that a new race of people will inhabit the world in the New Age millennium has been expressed by other believers in the religion. Ruth Montgomery, previously mentioned, has written about that change: 'Those who survive the shift will be a different type of people from those in physical form today, freed from strife and hatred, longing to be of service to the whole of mankind...the souls who helped to bring on the chaos of the present century [apparently the Christians and the Jews] will have passed into spirit to rethink their attitudes.' \"To show that the New Agers are talking about the physical death of the 'enemy', one must only search the writings of other New Agers. Another believer to write on the subject of the destruction of those who will not accept the new religion was Ruth Montgomery. [And] she has been quoted as saying in a transcribed interview carried by a magazine called Magical Blend : 'Millions will survive and millions won’t. Those who won’t will go into the spirit state because there is truly no death.' 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"Estimates of the number to perish have been made by some New Agers. One who has made such an estimate is John Randolph Price, who was quoted by Texe Marrs in his book about the New Age. [And] he said that: 'John Randolph Price was told by his spirit guide that up to two and one ‐ half billion [2,500,000,000] might perish in the coming chaos.'\" [William Cooper]: And we already know that the goal of the plan called \"Global 2000\" is to deplete the population by two billion people by the year 2000. \"[Now] that estimate is about half of the current world population[: two and one ‐ half billion]. \"Another estimate of the number required to die because they will not accept the new religion was offered by the so ‐ called 'Tibetan Master,' Djwhal Khul, who has said in one of his channeling experiences, that one ‐ third of all humanity must die by the year 2000. That would be about two billion people [at least]. \"Channeling is one of the strange activities occurring inside the New Age religion.\" [William Cooper]: I have witnessed this and I could tell you most channelers are just fraudulent con artists who are taking the money of those who pay to hear this channeling from dead spirits or ancient teachers or other world spirits. \"Some of the believers claim that they have the ability to call forth the deceased spirit of someone who lived many years before. Quite often these spirits claim to be [the] 'ascended masters,' those who have gone on to discover the eternal truths of all creation. One such believer who claimed to be in touch with a 'master' was Alice Bailey, previously mentioned. Her spirit called himself Djwhal Khul, and she claimed he spoke through her, saying: 'Death is not a disaster to be feared; the work of the Destroyer is not cruel or undesirable...therefore, there is much destruction permitted by the Custodians of The Plan and much evil turned into good.' \"[Now] just what 'The Plan' constituted was told to the world by Benjamin Creme, another New Age leader. He placed an advertisement in about twenty newspapers all over the world on April the 25th, 1982, that defined the term. The ad read, in part: 'What is The Plan? It includes the installation of a new world government and new world religion under Maitreya.' \"But perhaps the most startling examples of the teachings of this new religion came from the pen of Barbara Marx Hubbard, one of their most articulate writers. [And] she wrote in her book, entitled Happy Birthday Planet Earth : 'The choice is: do you wish to become a natural Christ, a universal human, or do you wish to die? People will either change or die. That is the choice.' \"So the people of the world will be given a choice: they will choose to accept the new world religion, or they will choose to die! The battle lines are drawn! Choices will have to be made. [William Cooper: I have made my choice. What is yours?] \"Some of the leading Socialists of the past have shown that they too have chosen up sides. One such individual was Adolf Hitler, the head of the German Government during World War II, who held no conviction that the murder of over fifty million [50,000,000] people during that war was wrong. He considered himself to be an agent of this unseen god in reducing the population of the people that he held to be undesirable. He wrote: 'I have the right to exterminate millions of individuals of inferior races, which multiply like vermin.' \"And he did what he considered acceptable inside his religion. Those who did not believe in his new religion had no choice, and they perished. (The evidence that Adolf Hitler was a New Ager will be presented later in [this series].) \"Another of the leading spokesman for the Socialist position was George Bernard Shaw, a well ‐ known writer [of] his day. He wrote a book, entitled The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Socialism , in which he stated: 'I also made it quite clear that socialism means equality of income or nothing, and under Socialism you would not be allowed to be poor. (Laughter) You would be forcibly fed, clothed, lodged, taught and employed whether you like it or not, whether you are useful or not. Even if it were discovered you had not the character and industry enough to be worth all this trouble, you might be executed in a kindly manner; but whilst you were permitted to live you would have to live well.' Socialism is the greatest perversion, deception, and lie that has ever existed on the face of this earth and has brought nothing but misery, death, poverty, to people who have been subjected to its cruelties. The Masonic writer, Albert Pike, placed the Masonic order into the discussion, when he wrote this in his book Morals and Dogma : 'It is not true to say that \"one man, however little, must not be sacrificed to another, however great, to a majority, or to all men.\" That is not only a fallacy, but a most dangerous one. Often one man and many men must be sacrificed, [to] the ordinary sense of the term, to the interest of the many...the interest and even the life of one man must often be sacrificed to the interest and welfare of his country.' \"The religious view is that the 'sacrifice' of one life for the interest of the 'many' is murder, and those who believe in the God of the Bible 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"are told not to commit this act. The commandment against this practice is contained in Exodus 20, verse 13 of the Old Testament, and in Matthew 5, verse 21 in the New, and is simply expressed in these simple words: 'Thou shalt not kill.' The principle is easy to understand: no person has the right to take the life of another. This understanding is nearly worldwide (there are, of course, cultures that have determined that human sacrifice, cannibalism and murder are acceptable forms of behavior, but these are rare in the history of man.) But, here we are being exposed to a whole new religious view, one growing daily in size and stature, that openly advocates the wholesale slaughter of entire races of people. \"Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the [Bavarian branch of the] Illuminati, has also endorsed this new conviction that murder was not improper by including it in the initiation ceremony into the Order. He has his initiator tell the initiate: 'Behold our secret...If in order to destroy all Christianity, all religion, we have pretended to have the sole true religion, remember that the end justifies the means, and that the wise ought to take all the means to do good, which the wicked take to do evil.' \"The initiate was told that he may use whatever means, murder included, to achieve the goals of the association that he was joining. And that the major goal of the Illuminati was the destruction of all religion, including Christianity. That meant that if Christians physically stood in the way, they would be removed by simply murdering them. \"Weishaupt even went so far as to say that anyone [anyone] not willing to take the life of another was unfit to join the Illuminati. He wrote the following in a letter to a fellow member in 1778: 'No man is fit for our Order who is not ready to go to every length...' \"Weishaupt wrote that again, this time using different words: 'This can be done in no other way but by secret associations, which will by degrees, and in silence, possess themselves of the government and of the States and make use of those means for this purpose, which the wicked use for attaining base ends.' \"[Now] Weishaupt[, folks,] was aware of the enormous power of government and he desired its power for his members. He committed his organization to its infiltration. Then, he committed it to unspeakable purposes: anything that would further the goal of the Illuminati. \"He even went on to grant permission to his members to distort the truth by lying if it would further their goals. He wrote [this]: 'There must not a single purpose ever come in sight...that may betray our aims against religion and the state. One must speak sometimes one way and sometimes another, but so as never to contradict ourselves, and so that, with respect to our true way of thinking, we may be impenetrable.'\" [William Cooper]: And you wonder why politicians continually lie? Continually break their promises? And no matter who you elect, Republican or Democrat, it doesn’t make any difference? \"Perhaps a perfect example of an oath that these initiates take somewhere along the road to the pinnacle inside the secret society was given in a book written by George Orwell entitled 1984 . Mr. Orwell has an initiate into a secret society called The Brotherhood in his story asked these questions: 'Are you prepared to give your life? Are you prepared to commit murder? Are you prepared to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people? Are you prepared to betray your country to foreign powers? Are you prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children? To distribute habit ‐ forming drugs? To encourage prostitution? To disseminate venereal diseases? To do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the people? Are you prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so?' \"This[, folks,] is an example of the philosophy that 'the ends justify the means.' The initiate should do as he was required, as long as the act benefited the Brotherhood. There is no morality under such an oath. \"So murder of the unfit, those unwilling to adopt the new religion, will be acceptable. And those who do the annihilating are to feel no remorse. In the view of the New Age religion, the murderers have served mankind well. \"But this callous disregard for the right to life of every human on the face of the earth has been predicted before. In the New Testament, John was moved to write in John, chapter 16, verse 2: 'Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God’s service.'\" [William Cooper]: The New World Order, ladies and gentlemen, will sail in on a sea of blood. We have to take a short break, folks. Don't go away. I'll be right back after this short pause. (break music: God Bless the Child , sung by Lisa Simpson, written by Billie Holiday and Arthur Herzog Jr.) 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"[William Cooper advertises upcoming appearance in San Diego once again] [William Cooper]: Well, let's continue here. \"The New Age religion[, folks,] is going to have a worldwide leader. A charismatic political and religious leader that they call, Lord Maitreya. [William Cooper: At least, so far that’s who they call him, or that’s what they call him.] This individual [as far as I know] has not made his public appearance yet, but the New Agers claim that he is on the earth, at the present time. They claim that he came to live with the Asian community in East London, England in July 1977, by 'descending' from his ancient retreat in the Himalaya Mountains along the border of India and Tibet. They further believe that 'his imminent reemergence into full public view is assured.' \"They also claim that this individual is the one that the Christians call Christ, the Jews call the Messiah, The Buddhists call the Fifth Buddha, The Hindus call the Krishna, and the Muslims call the Imam Mahdi. In other words, all of the major religions of the world are awaiting the arrival of this one individual. It is their claim that this one individual now [living] in London is the one expected by all of these religions.\" [William Cooper]: However, when we search London with a fine toothed comb, we can find no trace of any living individual named Maitreya, or fitting this description, or recognized as this religious leader. Isn’t that strange? \"And [they say] he is on the earth now, patiently waiting for the appointed time to reveal his existence to the peoples of the world. They say that he will apparently assume the leadership of all these religions, and when does he will create a one ‐ world religion. \"The New Agers have written that in the esoteric tradition (previously defined as being intended for or understood by only a chosen few as an inner group of disciples or initiates) [William Cooper: In other words, the esoteric means 'hidden.' They claim that] the word 'Christ' is not the name of an individual, but the name of an office, or function, within the Spiritual Hierarchy of Masters. [They claim] the masters are a group of perfected men who have guided human evolution from behind the scenes for centuries. And they believe that this Lord Maitreya is that Christ. \"[Now,] Manly P. Hall has written of this individual, by identifying him as 'the way, the truth and the life, which coming to every life, redeems all who accept it.' Texe Marrs has quoted this individual as saying: 'My Army is ready for battle, My Masters of Wisdom and Myself at the head. That battle will be fought for the continuance of man on this earth. Rest assured that my Army shall triumph.' \"[Well,] it appears that the battle to be fought between the followers of Lord Maitreya and the rest of humanity is still in the future. But at least one of the participants has an army already prepared. [William Cooper: How about you?] \"One who claims to have seen the birth in a 'vision' of someone who seems to fulfill the requirements of this Maitreya was astrologer Jeane Dixon. Her major claim to being a 'prophet' is her prediction, reportedly made before the event, of the assassination of John Kennedy in 1963. However, her credentials were dealt a serious blow in 1968 when she also 'prophesied' that the Soviet Union would be the first to put a man on the moon. (Laughter) Another of her 'prophecies' was that the Republican party would be victorious in 1968 (and it was with the election of Richard Nixon, a Republican,) but she also predicted that 'within the following decade (1970 ‐ 1979) the two ‐ party system as we known it will vanish from the American scene. \"She further predicted that Richard M. Nixon had 'excellent vibrations for the good of America' and would 'serve [the] country well.'\" [William Cooper: (Laughter) [Sarcasm] So, you can see she is a very accurate person, from which to judge the course of the future. [End sarcasm] You want to know the truth folks, I am the most accurate prophet of future events in history...in history. \"Those that question her inability to correctly predict that America, not the Soviet Union, would become the first to place a man on the moon; and that the two ‐ party system has not vanished from the scene; and that president Nixon apparently did not have 'good vibrations' for this nation and would later be removed from office by the event commonly referred to as 'Watergate,' can only presume that she must have been given 'inside' information about the assassination of President Kennedy. And that would account for her knowing, at least in that event, the true future. \"Secondly, one can only wonder why this 'non ‐ prophet' should be listened to about anything after her appalling record on 'prophecies,' but there is reason to believe that she might have been asked to write an account of this 'vision' of the important birth by the New Age religion because they wanted the official imprimatur of someone commonly referred to as a 'prophet.' In other words[, folks,] her 'prophecy' might have been written to legitimize his claim to be a man ‐ god so that when this individual made his public appearance himself, the public would marvel at the fact that his birth had fulfilled a 'prophecy.' (Laughter) 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"\"But in any event, Ruth Montgomery wrote a book about her, entitled The Gift of Prophecy , in which she wrote about the very revealing and intriguing vision that Jeane Dixon allegedly had: 'The vision which [Jeane] considers the most significant and soul ‐ stirring of her life occurred on February the 5th, 1962. She saw the brightest sun she had ever seen. [William Cooper: Isn’t it funny how that sun always pops into this stuff? Now, remember that reference to the sun, folks.] \"'Stepping out into the brightness were a pharaoh and Queen Nefetiti. [Remember here that these two individuals were Egyptians. [Now,] this will become significant later on. [William Cooper: In fact, its already significant if you’ve been listening to this show.] The couple...thrust forth a baby as if offering it to the entire world.'\" [William Cooper: Now another interpretation, because they sprang from the sun, could be Osiris and Isis and the child is Horus, and that is exactly is the esoteric real interpretation, although Jeanie Dixon never said this. \"Jeane looked at the baby and said, according to author: 'I knew here is the beginning of wisdom.'\" [William Cooper]: Remember what I told you? Osiris is the doctrine, Isis is the church, the child Horus is the body of illumined Initiates. \"So what Ruth Montgomery wrote can be summarized as follows: A sun deity gives the world a child from Egypt, who possess enormous 'wisdom'. And this event allegedly took place on February the 5th, 1962. The interpretation of these symbols [have already been discussed and will continue to be] discussed [during this series, and the significance will be plain to all.] \"[Jeane then says,] 'A child, born somewhere in the Middle East shortly after 7 a.m. (E.S.T.) on February [the 5th], 1962, will revolutionize the world. Before the close of the century, he will bring together all mankind in one all ‐ embracing faith. \"'Mankind will begin to feel the great force of this man in the early 1980s, and during the subsequent ten years the world as we know it will be reshaped into one without wars and suffering. His power will grow greatly and until 1999, [[and then this] year is extremely significant as will also be [discussed]] at which time the peoples of this earth probably discover the full meaning of the vision.' \"So according to this 'vision', [this] child, born on February [the 5th], 1962, will grow up to bring a one ‐ world religion onto the face of the earth and his efforts will be successful in 1999. \"The New York Times newspaper[, folks,] ran three consecutive articles on the conjunction of five planets, the sun the moon and an 'invisible body that astrologers call Khetu,' starting on February [the 4th], 1962. The first article stated that the various bodies moved into 'rough alignment in the constellation Capricorn at 7:05 a.m., New York time...'\" [William Cooper]: Now Capricorn, remember, is the goat. In history, the goat was the goat of Mendes, or the Ram. \"[And the newspaper article also says] that they would 'remain in that alignment until 7:17 a.m., New York time, Monday.'\" [William Cooper]: The goat of Mendes, the Ram, is also another word, or another name, for Lucifer, Satan. \"However, the article went on to say that most of the people in India became alarmed, because most astrologers were making 'predictions of disasters.' There were a few astrologers who were predicting good for the world as a result of this alignment, but 'few Indians appear[ed] to be paying them much heed.' [William Cooper]: Now couple that with Jean Dixon’s prediction that the child was born on February the 5th, 1962, midpoint in this alignment, and what do you get? (laughter) They are going to great pains to prepare the world for something. \"Astronomers did not consider the event to be rare, however, and the article went on to report that 'the same configuration [had] occurred several times in the past,' the last time being in April, 1821, and then it occurred twice. The article reported that Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin of the Museum of Natural History ‐ Hayden Planetarium in New York, had commented that that year does not seem to be a year of any remembered disasters. He was then quoted as saying: 'And that year isn’t famous for anything as far as I know.' (Laughter) \"Dr. Franklin also commented on the body the astrologers call Khetu. He 'speculated that it may be some sort of astrological addition used to make everything come out right.' He then added that he believed Khetu 'to be the invisible planet that is frequently taken into account in astrological reckonings, but that he had no idea how it was possible to keep track of something that no one could see [William Cooper: and, as far as he knew, didn’t even exist].' \"The Times carried another article the next day, Monday, February [the 5th], 1962, [William Cooper: the date that the supposed child 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"was born] and it repeated the concern of the Hindu astrologers. In fact, that headline read 'Hindu Astrologers Still Say It’s Doomsday.' And the sub ‐ headline read, 'Peaceful Beginning of Planetary Event Is Viewed Gravely.' \"[Now] the third article [in] the series ran on the Tuesday, February [the 6th], 1962, and carried the headline '\"Doomsday\" in India Uneventful.' (Laughter) The article reported that the Indian astrologers had 'predicted a variety of disasters, earthquakes, tidal waves, devastating fires, and warfare, to name but a few,' but that none of these events has occurred. Furthermore, the article reported that Hindu priests had claimed that the reason that nothing had happened was because their prayers to their god had been answered. \"But [folks,] none of these three articles mentioned the birth of anyone on these three days. Furthermore, none but a few astrologers had believed that something good was going to happen, and that only a few in India had even listened to them. Only Jeane Dixon, another 'astrologer,' had seen [a vision of] something beneficial, in this case a birth of a baby 'full of wisdom,' at about the midpoint of the three day affair. \"One can only wonder if, once again, she missed the mark and was involved in another error [William Cooper: or if she was intentionally made to set up the world to welcome someone named Lord Maitreya]. \"In any event, these people claim that the Lord Maitreya will appear shortly to the entire world and start everyone off on a road to a one world religion. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in her book, entitled The Secret Doctrine called him 'the dragon of wisdom.'\" [William Cooper]: So, it appears that the one call that Jeane Dixon made that appears to match other comments is her statement that the baby she saw in her vision was ‘full of wisdom’. If the baby she claimed to have seen in her vision was Lord Maitreya, then she was right because others have claimed that Lord Maitreya is fill of wisdom. \"However, there is still reason to believe that she was given 'inside' information by some New Agers that wanted to have this 'Lord's [Maitreya] birth 'prophesied' so that when he did surface, the New Agers could claim that his birth had been 'a fulfilled prophecy.' [William Cooper]: So the world awaits the visible appearance of Lord Maitreya. Ladies and Gentlemen, dear listeners, so that you would realize that I'm not making any of this up, I took last night’s program and tonight’s program, verbatim, from the introduction all the way through Chapter 3, from a book entitled The New World Order , by my good friend A. Ralph Epperson. Again, the title of the book is The New World Order , by A. Ralph Epperson. And you can order that book in any good bookstore. If you can’t find it in your area, contact us and we will make arrangements with Mr. Epperson to be able to furnish that book to you if you would like to purchase it. I also recommend you purchase my book, Behold a Pale Horse . It's a handbook for what is going to happen in the upcoming years. Especially in this country. And without it, you will be crippled. [Instructions to order the book from the radio show; asks for money to pay for air time] Folks, we are nearing the end of the road of civilization as we know it, unless we wake up. Unless we take control and make sure the future is what we want it to be, and one of the things we must do now, immediately, is to stop fighting amongst each other. Stop fighting the man who doesn't look like you, or the woman who doesn’t look like you. The people who have a different skin color than you do. We must learn to live together and its nobody else’s business what somebody else’s religion is. It doesn’t hurt us if they want to practice their religion as long as they are not hurting us in the process. So why go to war with them? We are all brothers and sisters in this world, no matter who we are. Let’s learn to live together and love each other. Good night, and God bless each and every one of you!

'For the Universal Church, I renew the plea,' he said. 'Could not all Christians come to reconsider the kind of primacy the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, exercised within the early church?'\" Again, folks, that was the Dallas Morning News , October 1st, 1989. This story appeared in the Bakersfield Californian , August 27th, 1989: \"Baptist and Catholic Theologians Find Common Ground. Associated Press ‐ NEW YORK: Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics, the nation's two largest denominations, generally have been regarded as doctrinally far apart, but their scholars find they basically agree.

Countless millions have been slaughtered in the name of God, Allah, Buddha, Mohamed, Christ, for thousands of years. Christian killing Jew, Jew hating Muslim, the Muslim against the Hindu, Christian fighting Christian, Shiite versus Suni, Sikh against Hindu.

Well, is it possible for people of varied faiths and cultures to live at peace in this world? When one considers the fragmentation and division, even among Christians, or the neverending conflict between Palestinian and Jew, prospects for peace seem very, very dim. Some, aware of the dark record of history, would abolish all religion. Some would combine all religion, as is the intent in the New World Order, and anyone who refused will simply be exterminated. Today, something unmatched in history is taking place. Leading statesmen and religious leaders are proposing a New World Order, a plan that many sincerely believe can bring peace on earth. A unity is envisioned that will transcend instinctive barriers that have long separated cultures and religions. Significant progress toward a New World Order is seen in the spirit of ecumenism , or togetherness, now being urged by prominent religious leaders, and being brought to reality, to fruition, by the World Council of Churches [WCC]. In the ecumenical plan, basic theological or ideological differences are set aside, while emphasis is instead placed upon those elements common to most religions. And I can tell you that the new world religion will be a religion that serves man, because man is to become god in the New World Order. And the religion will change with the needs of man. Could the long, desired universal peace be just around the corner? Could this succeed? Is it actually possible for man to forge a lasting peace on the anvil of compromise? Or could it be that we are naively forging not a New World Order, but rather the one ‐ world order of apocalyptic prophecy? Or is it all an invention of the mind of man throughout the ages to manipulate large masses and populations of people? I make no judgment, and I do not try to answer all of these questions. You must do that in your own mind, but I must ask those questions, for many of you have never even thought to ask them. While controversial, folks, it is not the purpose of this program, the Hour of the Time, to disparage or attack the honest convictions of any sincere persons, whatever their politic or faith, for am I true Constitutionist, and I believe that we each have the right to believe whatever we wish, no matter who likes it or dislikes it, and worship at the altar of whichever god we choose, no matter who likes it or who dislikes it. It happens to be one of the precepts of living in freedom. You must understand that. No one's right to believe what they want or practice the religion that they want can be hindered until the practice of that religion, or the activation of those beliefs, infringe upon the freedom of someone else. Now, I sincerely, in my heart and in my soul, believe this. Without this belief, man cannot live in freedom; it must be subjected to slavery, and any intelligent, free ‐ thinking person can quickly make that connection. That is why, even if you do not like the ravings of the Nazi speaker standing on the street corner, he must be allowed to stand and rave. And if you wish to listen, that is your business. If you wish to close your ears and walk away, that also is your business. But when you shut him up, you shut yourself up, no matter who you are or what it is that you say. For what we do to one, we do to all. Therefore, understand that this is a program bringing you information and, we hope, education. It is not designed to attack anyone, but merely to shine some light in the dark corners of history, where light has not been found before. You see, our purpose is bring out facts and principles, which have a bearing upon coming events. For those of you who may not realize it, this is not a religious show. This is not a religious show. This is a show that is designed to educate. Illuminate, if you will, and that's very ironic, because we are illuminating those who call themselves, \"Illumined,\" who have been causing us misery for thousands of years. We're trying to reveal the hidden agenda behind the New World Order, and along with it the ecumenical movement that almost no one dares to discuss, which is a part of the bringing about of the New World Order. But you see, folks, these issues must be freely discussed no matter who you are or what you believe, for those who know history know that history repeats. And those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat the history. As Winston Churchill once observed, folks, \"The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you can see.\" And that is really the secret why my predictions have been so accurate, so accurate that, at this moment, I am the most successful and accurate prophet on the face of this earth. But I am not really a prophet, I am a messenger. And they're not prophecy that I give you, they're predictions based upon actual study, research, of history, and of the plan of those who call themselves the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages,\" the practicers of that religion called Mystery Babylon. And it is real, and it doesn't matter whether you believe in any of this or not. If the practitioners believe it, it will affect you, especially if they hold powerful positions in the world, and I can assure you that they do. So, this is not a religious program, folks, it just happens to be true that the New World Order is founded upon the religious history of the past. And it is all about religion, as you will soon see. [Reading from The Great Controversy , written by Ellen White]: \"When Jesus revealed to His disciples the fate of Jerusalem and the scenes of the second advent, He foretold also the experience of His people from the time when He should be taken from them, [until] His return in power and glory for their deliverance.\" [William Cooper]: This is what the Bible says. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"\"In a few brief utterances of awful significance, Jesus foretold the portion which the rulers of this world would mete out to the church of God in Matthew chapter 24, verse 9, verse 21 and verse 22.\" [William Cooper]: Now, the reason I am quoting this is because, if what is happening is being brought about by religious history, then we must understand the religious history, and the books, and the chapters, and the verses that this religious history is based upon. For whatever belief is driving the minds of the men that are bringing about the New World Order, and the minds of the men who are fighting the New World Order, it must be understood by all the rest of us who don't understand any of this, or we are surely lost. \"The history of the early church testified to the fulfillment of Jesus' words...[As] the fires of persecution were kindled, Christians were stripped of their possessions and driven from their homes...Great numbers sealed with their testimony in blood. Noble and slave, rich or poor, [it didn't matter] learned and ignorant, were alike slain without mercy.\" [William Cooper]: And unless what is coming is stopped, this will repeat itself. \"These persecutions, beginning under Nero the emperor of Rome, A.D. 55 to 68, about the time of martyrdom of Paul, continued with greater or less fury for centuries. Christians were falsely accused of the most dreadful crimes, and declared to be the cause of all the calamities – famine, pestilence, and earthquake...They were condemned as rebels against the empire as enemies of religion and pests to society. Great numbers were thrown to wild beasts or burned alive in the amphitheaters. Some were crucified; others were covered with the skins of wild animals and thrust into the arena to be torn by dogs...Vast multitudes assembled to enjoy these sights and greeted their dying agonies with laughter and applause.\" [William Cooper]: For, in that day, it was known as the great Roman Circus [Maximus] ‐‐ the football, the Super Bowl of that era. \"[Because they] were hunted like beasts of prey, [the early Christians were] forced to seek concealment in desolate and solitary places...Beneath the hills outside the city of Rome, long galleries were tunneled through earth and rock; the dark and intricate network of passages extended for miles beyond the city walls. In these underground retreats the followers of Christ buried their dead...When the Life ‐ giver shall [return to] awaken those who fought the good fight, many a martyr for Christ's sake will come forth from those gloomy [catacombs]. [William Cooper]: In vain were Satan's, or Lucifer's efforts to destroy the church of Christ by violence. You see, God's workmen were slain, but his work went steadily forward. Said a Christian, \"You may torment, afflict and vex us. The more we are mowed down, the more we spring up again. The blood of Christians is seed [Tertullian, in his Apology, paragraph 50].\" \"Thousands were imprisoned and slained, but others sprang up to fill their place...[Now the] Great Adversary [who Christians believe is Satan, also known as Lucifer, but whom the Mystery Schools believe is Jehovah or Yahweh, through adversary] endeavored to gain by artifice what he had failed to secure by force. Persecution ceased, and in its [place] were substituted the dangerous allurements and temporal prosperity and worldly honor.\" [William Cooper]: For if it they could not stamp out the Christians by violence, by killing them, by crucifying them, by throwing them to the lions and to the dogs and to the gladiators...if they could not get rid of them in that manner, and if the empire was threatened by them, then there had to be a way to save the Roman Empire, to save the emperor from that pestilence known as Christianity. \"Idolaters were led to receive a part of the Christian faith, while they rejected other essential truths. They professed to accept Jesus as the Son of God and to believe in His death and resurrection, but they had no conviction of sin and felt no need of repentance or of a change of heart. [And] with some concessions on their part, they proposed that Christians should make concessions, that all might unite on the platform of belief in Christ. \"Now, the church was in fearful peril. Prison, torture, fire and sword were blessings in comparison with this. Some of the Christians stood firm, declaring that they could make no compromise. Others were in favor of yielding or modifying some features of their faith and uniting with those who accepted a part of Christianity, urging that this might be the means of their full conversion...[And] that was a time of deep anguish [for] the faithful followers of Christ [William Cooper: according to the written history of the Christian religion]... \"...This compromise between Paganism and Christianity resulted in the development of 'the man of sin', foretold in prophecy as opposing and exalting himself above God... \"The apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, foretold the great apostasy which would result in the establishment of the papal power. He declared that the day of Christ should not come, 'except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.'\" 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, verses 3 and 4, and that prophecy has come true. As man stands in the temple of the body today and declares himself to be God. And furthermore, the apostle warned his brethren, that the mystery of iniquity doth already worked. And what is the mystery of iniquity? It is the Mystery Religion of Babylon, the worship of the heavens, the Osirian cycle, of which the sun is the symbol of the intellect. \"Even at that early date he saw, creeping into the church, errors that would prepare the way for the development of...[that] gigantic system of false religion, a masterpiece of Satan's power – a monument of his efforts to seat himself upon the throne and rule the earth according to his will... \"...The nominal conversion of [the Roman emperor] Constantine, in the early part of the fourth century, caused great rejoicing; and the world, cloaked with a form of righteousness, walked into the church. Paganism, while appearing the be vanquished, became the conqueror...[Pagan doctrine], ceremonies, and superstitions were incorporated into the faith and worship of the professed followers of Christ.\" [William Cooper]: And the ten commandments were changed to permit idols in the church, and other changes were made. You see, the day of rest was changed from the seventh day to the first day. Why? Because the first day was the date that the pagan religion worshiped the Sun: Osiris, the Light, Lucifer, the intellect. And so, the pure and simple teachings of Christ were corrupted beyond recognition. [reading from The Present Truth , written by Bishop Stephen D. Lewis]: \"[As Christians] consented to lower their standards, a union was formed between Christianity and paganism. Though the worshipers of idols professed to be converted, [they] united with the church [still clinging] to their idolatry, only changing the objects of their worship to images of Jesus, and even of Mary and the saints.\" [William Cooper]: But they still worshiped the same gods, and they always have. If you look at an aerial view of the Vatican, you will see that the outer courtyard is a round temple of the sun, exactly as the druids and the Celts built. And that in the center of this temple to the sun, to Osiris, stands the symbol of the Lost Word of Freemasonry: the phallus, the generative force, the penis of Osiris, the obelisk. You see, folks, the Roman Empire never fell. It just became the Catholic church. And the Roman emperor merely changed his name from \"emperor\" to \"pope\". Now, for those of you who may think that I'm crazy and that I have lost my mind, I'm going to read you verbatim from a book, entitled Dungeon, Fire and Sword . It is the complete history of the Knights Templar and the Crusades, written by John J. Robinson, author of Born in Blood . And I'm going to start at the second ‐‐ third paragraph on page 414, in the chapter entitled, Jesus Wept (1292 ‐ 1305) . That's a date ‐‐ those are dates, folks. \"In London, Edward sent for the master of the Knights Templar in England, Brian De Jaye. He told the master of his plans to chastise the upstart William Wallace in Scotland and ask that the Templar Knights go with him to fight for England. The temple master saw no barrier to committing his knights to a totally secular war that had nothing to do with religion or the true cross. It had been years since the fighting men of the temple had had anyone to fight. The calls for men and money no longer came from the headquarters in the east. They had no need for them. No monarch they knew in Europe was going to go on a Crusade, even if the Pope should call it, which he wouldn't, because the Pope had something much more important on his mind. Boniface VIII had came up with a way to increase the papal treasury, a way that could only come up once in a hundred years. The following year of 1299 marked the turn of a century, and Boniface would turn the usual secular celebration into a jubilee of joy for all Christians. Now there would be new pathways to the total remission of sins, much easier than going off on Crusades. Full absolution was offered to any pilgrim who would come to Rome for fifteen days with his offering for the church, and thus he could fill his coffers. \"Even at his most optimistic, the Pope had not foreseen the flood of pilgrims that would bring new prosperity to Rome. The local merchants and innkeepers were delighted with the business generated by almost two million pilgrims. Two priests stood all day and night behind the altar at the church of St. Paul, using rakes to drag away the steady stream of gold and silver offerings placed there by pilgrims who pushed their way through the mob to leave their gifts. \"Boniface VIII was ecstatic He remembered the words said to him as the papal crown had been placed on his head: 'Take the tiara, and know that thou art the father of princes and kings, the ruler of the world, the vicar on earth of our savior, Jesus Christ.' Now, he indeed felt like the ruler of the world as he staged a regal pageant He put on the dress and the insignia of the ancient Roman emperors and went out into the streets with two swords, held high in front of him, indicating his supreme authority over both the secular and the spiritual worlds, with heralds crying out, 'Behold! I am Caesar!'\" 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And this is just one example, because all through history, the Popes have, on occasion, made public admittance of the fact that Rome just became the church. Displayed on the walls of the Vatican is the double ‐ headed eagle, the insignia of only one man who has ever lived: the emperor of Rome. Now so I may not be accused of invention, folks, everything that I am giving you in this broadcast is coming right out of the writings of the historians of the Catholic church, of the Protestant church, of the Roman Empire, of the Knights Templar, and many others. You see, I'm not inventing any of this; it happens to be historical fact. And if you have eyes and can see, the emperor, now the Pope, to gain converts from heathenism, unsounded doctrine, superstitious rites, and the adoration of images and relics, were gradually introduced into Christendom worship. (continuing from The Great Controversy , written by Ellen White): \"The decree of a general council [the second council of Nice, A.D. 787] finally established this system of [Christian] idolatry. To complete the sacrilegious work, Rome presumed to [erase] the second commandment forbidding image worship [from the law of God], and to divide the tenth commandment...to preserve the number...\" \"[According to Christian historians and the Protestant church] Satan...tampered with the fourth commandment also, and [purposed] to set aside the ancient Sabbath, the day which God had blessed and sanctified [in Genesis, chapter 2, verse 2 and 3], and in its stead to exalt the festival observed by the heathen as 'the venerable day of the sun.' This change was not at first attempted openly. In the first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by all Christians. They were jealous for the honor of God, and...they zealously guarded the sacredness of its precepts. But with great subtlety Satan worked through his agents to bring about his object.\" [William Cooper]: Now don't go away folks, we've got to take a short break. We'll be right back after this short pause. (break music: Ain't No Sunshine , written by Bill Withers) [continuing from The Great Controversy , written by Ellen White]: \"[Early in] the fourth century the emperor Constantine issued a decree making Sunday a public festival throughout the Roman Empire. The day of the sun was reverenced by his pagan subjects and was honored by Christians; it was the emperor's policy to unite the conflicting interests of heathenism and Christianity [to save the Roman Empire]. He was urged to do this by the bishops of the church, who...perceived that if the same day was observed by both Christians and [the] heathen, it would promote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by pagans and thus advance the power and glory of the church.\" (reading from Is the Virgin Mary Dead or Alive ): \"But while [most] Christians were gradually regard Sunday as possessing a degree of sacredness, [some] still held the true Sabbath...holy [and they continued to observe] it in obedience to the fourth commandment... \"[Now, they believe that] Satan had led the Jews, before the advent of Christ, to load down the Sabbath with the most rigorous exactions, making its observance a burden...[He casts] contempt upon it as a Jewish institution...[until finally the pagan Sunday came] to be honored as a divine institution...While the Bible [Sabbath] was pronounced as a relic of Judaism, and its observers were [at last] declared to be accursed.\" [William Cooper]: And the outcome of this, is that the Jews had been persecuted throughout history. They had become the scapegoat that you learned about in an earlier broadcast. \"The spirit of concession to paganism opened the way for a still further disregard of Heaven's authority.\" (reading from The Great Controversy ): \"[The visible head of the church, the pope] came to be almost universally acknowledged as the [vicegerent] of God on earth, [and he 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"was] endowed with authority over church and state...More than this, the pope [appropriated] the very titles of Deity. [He styled himself] 'Lord God the Pope,' [assumed infallibility, and demanded that all men pay him homage]... \"...Faith was transferred from Christ, the true foundation [of the Christian church], to the pope of Rome. Instead of trusting in [Christ] for forgiveness of sins and for eternal salvation, people looked to the pope, and to the priests and prelates to whom he delegated authority. They were taught that the pope was their earthly mediator and that none could approach God except through him; and, further, that he stood in the place of God to them and was therefore to be implicitly obeyed. A deviation from his requirements was [sufficient] cause for the severest punishment to be visited upon the bodies and souls of the offenders. [Through this error] the people were turned from God to fallible, erring...men.\" [William Cooper]: Blasphemous titles claimed for the Pope had embellished and enlarged over the centuries, but a few of these boastful claims appear in an ecclesiastical Roman Catholic dictionary. I'm taking this right out of a Roman Catholic dictionary by Lucius Ferraris, entitled Prompta Bibliothecca Canonica , volume 6, pages 438 and 442, article, Pope, the Catholic Encyclopedia, 1813 edition, volume 6, page 48, speaks of this book as \"a veritable encyclopedia of religious knowledge and a precious mine of information.\" Those are the words of the Vatican. \"The Pope is of so great dignity and so exalted that he is not a mere man, but as it were, God and the vicar of God.\" Remember, the Roman emperors were deified. \"Hence, the pope is crowned with a triple crown as King of heaven and of earth and of the lower regions.\" That is an exact word ‐ for ‐ word description of Osiris. \"So that if it were possible that the angels might err in the faith or think contrary to the faith, they could be judged and excommunicated by the pope.\" [William Cooper]: \"The pope is, as it were, God on earth, sole sovereign of the faithful of Christ, chief King of Kings, having plenitude of power to whom has been entrusted by the omnipotent God direction, not only of the earthly, but also of the heavenly kingdom.\" If that's not blasphemy, according to the definition, then I don't know what is, folks. [William Cooper]: \"The Pope can modify divine law, as since his power is not of man, but of God.\" The Pope can modify divine law? Well, you see that he did. He changed the day of rest dictated by God from the seventh day to the first day, and he changed the ten commandments to allow the worship of idols. But the doctrine of papal supremacy is directly opposed to the teachings of any scripture that I am able to find. \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\" That's in Luke, chapter 4, verse 8. God has never given a hint in His word that He appointed any man but Christ to be the head of the church. The bible exalts God, and places finite man in their true position. The Pope has no power over Christ's church except by usurpation, and that's true only if you are a Christian. If you are Jew, if you are a Muslim, if you are a Buddhist, none of that is true, is it? \"[By the] sixth century [folks] the papacy [was] firmly established. Its seat of power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was declared to be head over the entire church...[William Cooper: Pagan Rome had given place to the papal Rome]...The accession of the Roman church to power marked the beginning of the Dark Ages. As her power increased, the darkness of superstition and error deepened... \"Those were days of peril for the church of Christ. Faithful standard ‐ bearers were few...at times it seemed that error and superstition would wholly prevail, and true religion would be banished from the earth. The gospel was lost sight of, but the forms of religion were multiplied... \"[People] were taught not only to look to the pope as their mediator, but to trust to works of their own for sin. Long pilgrimages, acts of penance, the worship of relics, the erection of churches, shrines, and altars, the payment of large sums to the church ‐‐ these and many similar acts were enjoined to appease the wrath of God or to secure His favor; as if God were like men, to be angered at trifles, or pacified by gifts or acts of penance!\" [William Cooper]: And even then, the church still worshiped the old gods. For in dismantling churches for renovation throughout Europe, throughout Europe, without exception, and the older the church, the more likely it was to be true. Enshrined within the altar, out of sight of the priests and the worshipers, were found stone penises, symbols of the Lost Word of Freemasonry, the phallus of Osiris, the generative force of the pagan religion of the worship of the sun, the light, Lucifer, the intellect. This is historic fact. This is not invention, but fact. \"About the close of the 8th century, papists put forth the claim that in the first ages of the church the bishops of Rome had possessed the same spiritual power which they now assumed. To establish this claim...Ancient writings were forged by monks [William Cooper: and it has been proven they were forged]. Decrees of councils before unheard of were discovered, establishing the universal supremacy of the pope from the earliest times. And a church that had rejected the truth greedily accepted these deceptions... \"...Another step in papal assumption was taken, when, in the eleventh century, Pope Gregory VII proclaimed the perfection of the Roman church. Among the propositions which he put forth was one declaring that the church had never erred, nor would it ever err, according to the Scriptures.\" 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: But I wonder what they told Galileo when they imprisoned him for being right that the Earth revolved around the sun, and that the Earth was not the center of the universe, and that the universe did not revolve around the Earth. I wonder what they told Galileo. How did they justify being right, when they were obviously wrong? And not only with Galileo, but Giordano Bruno and many others. Many, many others as a matter of fact, many of whom were burned at the stake for daring to disagree with was then considered to be politically correct. For many of them had discovered scientific truths, and when they espouse these truths, were declared to be heretics, and were burned at the stake because the pope declared these truths to be falsehoods. And that, folks, was the birth of the doctrine known as \"political correctness.\" And you see it reappearing now, where truths are again declared to be false, because they are not politically correct. What are you going to accept in this world? [William Cooper]: Now, once again, I want to tell you: we're not attacking anyone. I care not what you believe. I care not what altar you worship at, for I am a true Constitutionist. It makes no difference to any of you what my religion is, although I will freely tell you that I attempt in my daily life to follow the true words of Christ, not the doctrine or the preachings of any church or any evangelist or any book, but those words attributed to Christ and only to Christ. And, as the rock upon which those words stand, the ten commandments as given to Moses by God. That is the sum total of my religion, of my beliefs, of what I practice in my daily life. I'm not asking you to do that at all, but I am asking everyone to quit accepting what they are told. To begin an honest, individual, personal search for the truth. [William Cooper]: For we can no longer live in deception, we can no longer live the lies of the past. Great change lies ahead of us, folks. Change will come, whether we want it or not, for that is the way of the world and the way of the universe. And if we are still living in lies and deceptions and manipulations, then that change will be for the bad, just as it has as always been throughout the history of the world. And blood with flow and people will suffer all in the name, once again, of religion. And I, for one, am sick of it. Sick of it! We must discover the truth and we must lead our lives by the truth, and we must take the truth into the future, and we must determine the future from the truth, and nothing else. Nothing else. For if we do not, those who have decided that they are the only truly mature minds and, thus, the only ones capable of rule because the rest of us do not use our intelligence and, thus, are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent ‐‐ no better than animals who do not have intelligence...they have determined that they are going to shackle us, once again, in slavery because we cannot control ourselves, or rule ourselves, or live by the truth. This is what they have determined, right or wrong, whether you believe them or whether you believe that they know what they claim that they know, or not. It is what they have determined and, I assure you, they are in control right now. Right now, right this moment. And in this country, their headquarters is in a temple without windows exactly thirteen blocks from the White House: the headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. \"[Now, when the pope declared] that the church never erred, nor would it ever err according to the scriptures...the [Scriptural] proofs did not accompany the assertion. [Next, the] proud pontiff also claimed the power to depose emperors, and declared that no sentence which he pronounced could be reversed by anyone, but that it was his prerogative to reverse the decisions of all others... \"...The advancing centuries witnessed a constant increase of error in the doctrines put forth from Rome. Even before the establishment of the papacy the teachings of heathen philosophers had received attention and exerted an influence in the church...Prominent among these was the belief in man's natural immortality and his consciousness in death. This doctrine laid the foundation upon which Rome established the invocation of saints and the adoration of the Virgin Mary. From this sprang also the heresy of eternal torment for the finally impenitent, which was early incorporated into the papal faith.\" [William Cooper]: And thus, once again, the worship of Osiris, and Mary, and the child, Horus, disguised under different names, emerged as a religion from the veil out into the open. The only thing that has changed is the names. \"Then the way was prepared for the introduction of still another invention of paganism, which Rome named purgatory, and employed to terrify the credulous and superstitious multitudes. By this heresy is affirmed the existence of a place of torment, in which the souls of such as have not merited eternal damnation are to suffer punishment for their sins, and from which, when freed from impurity, they are admitted to heaven... \"...The Scriptural ordinance of the Lord's Supper had been supplanted by the idolatrous sacrifice of the mass. Papal priests pretended, by their senseless mummery, to convert the simple bread and wine into the actual 'body and blood of Christ.' [William Cooper: And those are the exact words, 'body and blood of Christ,' written by Cardinal Wiseman], The Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the Blessed Eucharist, Proved From Scripture , lecture 8, sec. 3, par. 26.\" [William Cooper]: But no scripture is quoted. \"With blasphemous presumption, they openly claimed the power of creating God, the Creator of all things. [All] Christians were required, on pain of death, to avow their faith in this horrible, Heaven ‐ insulting heresy. Multitudes who refused were given to the flames [were burned at the stake]...\" 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Is it any wonder that the invisible college, the, worshipers of Mystery Babylon, those who call themselves the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages,\" hate Christianity? \"...Still another fabrication was needed to enable Rome to profit by the fears and the vices of her adherents. This was supplied by the doctrine of indulgences. Full remission of sins, past, present, and future, and release from all the pains and penalties incurred, were promised to all who would enlist in the pontiff's wars to extend his temporal dominion, to punish his enemies, or to exterminate those who dared deny his spiritual supremacy. The people were also taught that by the payment of money to the church they might free themselves from sin, and [also] release the souls of their deceased friends who were confined in the tormenting flames. By such means [did] Rome fill her coffers and sustain the magnificence, luxury, and vice of the pretended representatives of Him who had not where to lay His head.\" [William Cooper]: And the old Roman Empire flourished under the guise of the Vatican, the papacy, the Catholic church. \"...In the thirteenth century was established that most terrible of all the engines of the papacy ‐‐ the Inquisition. The prince of darkness wrought with the leaders of the papal hierarchy. In their secret councils Satan and his angels controlled the minds of evil men [who invented tortures] too horrible to appear to human eyes. 'Babylon the great' was 'drunken with the blood of the saints.' The mangled forms of millions of martyrs cried to God for vengeance upon that apostate power.\" [William Cooper]: This is word to word [sic] from history, folks. \"Popery had become the world's despot. Kings and emperors bowed to the decrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of men, both for time and for eternity, seemed under his control. For hundreds of years the doctrines of Rome had been extensively and implicitly received, its rites reverently performed, [and] its festivals generally observed. Its clergy were honored and liberally sustained...But 'the noon of the papacy was the midnight of the world.' [That was written by] J. A. Wylie, The History of Protestantism[, b. 1, ch. 4.]\" [William Cooper]: Now, Protestantism is not lily ‐ white, either. I use that term, \"lily ‐ white,\" because throughout history it's been used to describe good, when in fact, in many instances, there's nothing good about it whatsoever. Protestantism, folks, began in the Reformation, when Martin Luther rebelled against the Pope. But did you know that Martin Luther used, as his personal seal, the rose and the cross? Revealing that he, himself, he himself was an initiate of the Mystery School, the ancient religion of Babylon. You see, I'm not attacking anyone, and I'm not putting anyone on a pedestal I'm not tearing down the Vatican in order to build up the Protestant church, for they are equally guilty. Protestantism has fractured the teachings of Christ into thousands of sects and cults and little groups, all of them professing to know the truth. None of them really do. \"The Holy Scriptures were almost unknown, not only to the people, but to the priests...God's law, the standard of righteousness [in those days], having been removed, [papist leaders] exercised power without limit, and practiced vice without restraint. Fraud, avarice, and profligacy prevailed. Men shrank from no crime by which they could gain wealth or position. The palaces of popes and prelates were scenes of the vilest debauchery. Some of the reigning pontiffs were guilty of crimes so revolting that secular rulers endeavored to depose these dignitaries of the church as monsters too vile to be tolerated. For centuries Europe had made no progress in learning, arts, or civilization. A moral and intellectual paralysis had fallen upon [the world].\" [William Cooper]: \"The noon of the papacy,\" according to history, \"was the midnight of the world.\" \"...Foremost among those who were called to lead the church from the darkness of popery into the light of a purer faith, stood Martin Luther.\" [William Cooper]: And this is what people believe, but Martin Luther himself was an initiate of the Mystery Schools, a follower of the faith of Mystery Babylon, as was the Pope and the hierarchy of the Catholic church. You see, but they were vying for the rulership of the world, and up until not too long ago, have always had throughout history. For the Vatican practices the corrupted worship of Mystery Babylon, the combination of Christianity and the worship of Mystery Babylon, whereas the Mystery Schools retained the pure form of Mystery Babylon. And this is the only difference between the two, folks, and they have been vying throughout history for the rulership of the world: Mystery Babylon attempting to destroy the Pope and Christianity, and the Pope attempting to persecute and burn away the followers, the initiates of Mystery Babylon. And it has always been the goal of worshipers of Mystery Babylon to seat one of their own upon the throne of the Vatican, and they have succeeded. They have succeeded, folks, and now you are seeing the beginning of the combination of all religions into one ‐ world religion.

I'm William Cooper. (Intro music: Stardust , written by Hoagy Carmichael & Mitchell Parish) From Tinkerbell to Artie Shaw to George Bush’s Thousand Points of Light , America has been mesmerized by stardust since its very inception. And now, America is beginning to learn what all these references to the star, the morning star, Wish Upon a Star , Stardust , really is all about. [reading from: A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"There was something [very] strange about the classical mysteries; something which attracted people to them and having attracted them made their initiates with very few exceptions permanent devotees. In Egypt, Greece, India, Rome and a dozen other places and countries, sacred initiations took place in specially prepared sanctuaries [William Cooper: usually in a cave or underground]. Priests of the mysteries enjoyed the profound respect of the masses, as well as that of kings and counselors.\" [William Cooper]: And in those days there was nothing really secret about it except the initiations rites and the knowledge which they retained for themselves, giving only the exoteric to the people. \"What were the mysteries? Until relatively recently, and relying upon comparatively scattered fragments such as Apuleius' Golden Ass , historians and religious writers had formed an opinion of them which has been shown to be extremely naïve [William Cooper: if not, outright false]. They knew that at the ceremonies symbolical teaching took place, and hence inferred that the mysteries were a relic of the times when academic knowledge was guarded by the very few and scientific truths (such as Pythagorean theorems) were given only [and only] to the elect. They knew [also] that orgiastic drumming and dancing formed a part of many of the rituals, and therefore told their readers this was a degenerate form of religion, or a mere excuse for licentiousness. They found that stories of ancient gods and heroes were recited, and were sure the mysteries constituted little more than an underground survival of prehistoric religion, magic or tribal initiation.\" [William Cooper]: Or maybe that’s exactly what they wanted us to believe, knowing full well that it was false. And, of course, if those who did the writing were members of the Mysteries, they would never have allowed the secrets to be revealed to the profane. \"But times have changed [folks]. The study of 'brainwashing' [William Cooper: and mind control] and conditioning the mind within the past decade [or so] has helped to lay bare the essence of the mysteries, and has answered the riddles which surrounded them. [You see,] in this process, those who have tried to keep the celebration of the mysteries alive, who have tried to revive them, have been shown up as relying upon the symbolic interpretation alone. And this revelation has been in its own way has been on of the most startling developments of contemporary religion. [You see, for] almost anyone, for instance, can get away with telling anyone else that he was an Egyptian priest in a former incarnation, because there is so very little verifiable material available to prove the reverse.\" [William Cooper]: It becomes obvious, though, when you attend a party populated by these nuts. When six people introduce themselves as having been Abraham Lincoln in a past life. 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"\"But let anyone attempt to celebrate any of the ancient mystery ‐ cults' rituals, and unless he has a sound idea on how the human mind works, he is unlikely to escape the criticism of those physiologists who now see in the mysteries an almost open book. \"[So] let us return to a sketch of the conventional knowledge about the mysteries. In those of Eleusis, celebrated in Greece, the candidate had to undergo...fasting or abstinence from certain foods. There were processions, with sacred statues carried from Athens to Eleusis. Those who were to be initiated waited for long periods of time outside the hall in the temple [where] the rites were to be held [William Cooper: building up a tremendous tension of suspense]. Eventually a torchbearer led them within the precincts [William Cooper: usually underground]. The ceremonies [usually] included a ritualistic meal; one or two dramas; the exhibition of sacred objects; the 'giving of the word'; (Laughter) an address by the hierophant; and, oddly enough, closure with the Sanskrit words: 'Cansha om pacsha.' \"The elements included the clashing of cymbals, tension and a certain degree of debilitation, eating something, plus conditions which were all ‐ inspiring, strange. The candidate was in the hands of, and guided by, the priesthood. Other factors: drinking a soporific draught; symbolic sentence of death; whirling around a circle. \"Initiation ceremonies of [certain] secret cults, the mystery ‐ type invariably involve tests, sometimes most severe ones. The effect of certain experiences was a carefully worked programme of mind training which is familiar in modern times as that which is employed by certain totalitarian states to 'condition' or reshape the thinking of an individual.\" [William Cooper]: Are you listening to me, all you Freemasons out there who think that you're so smart? Well, you're not. \"This process produces a state in which the mind is pliant enough to have certain ideas implanted: ideas which resist a great deal of counter ‐ influence. This was the secret of the mysteries, this and nothing else. Echoes of such training are to be seen in the rituals of certain secret societies without mystical pretensions which survive to this day: trials, terror, expectancy, drinking and the rest. \"That this fact was known in the past[, folks,] is evidenced by the words of Aristotle, who was exiled because he was said to have revealed something about the mysteries; and he said [this]: 'Those who are being initiated do not so much learn anything, as experience certain emotions, and are thrown into a special state of mind.' \"[Well,] what was this special state of mind? [Folks,] it was a plasticity, in order that the conditioning might take permanent root. The psychologist William [Walters] Sargant, the greatest authority on this subject, says in his classic Battle For The Mind : 'It seems, therefore, that there are common final paths which all individual animals (though initial temperamental responses to imposed stresses vary greatly) must finally take ‐‐ if only stresses are continued long enough. This is probably the same in human beings. [And] if so...may help to explain why excitatory drumming, dancing and continued bodily movement are so much used in such a number of primitive religious groups. The efforts and the excitement of keeping the dance in progress for many hours on end should wear down and if need be finally subdue the strongest and most stubborn temperament, such as might be able to survive frightening and exciting talk alone for days or weeks.'\" [William Cooper]: Now, understanding what I just read to you, this quote from Battle for the Mind by William Sargant...can you still say that music plays no part of the conditioning of the mind? That the words in the music is not being entrapped by the subconscious of those young people who dance for hours listening to this music? If so, I think you'd better rethink that position. For it is a form of mind control, brainwashing. \"Dr. Sargant notes that Chinese experiments in mass ‐ excitation, breaking down and reconditioning are based on same physiological principles as religious conversion and also individual and group psychotherapy treatments. [Folks,] these include the application of tension, fear, anxiety, conflict, to the point where subjects are uncertain. [And] in this state suggestibility is increased and the old pattern of behavior is disrupted. \"The fact that the devotees of the mysteries were thoroughly conditioned to them, and felt they were important in their lives, is seen in much historical evidence. Even in the fourth century of the Christian era, the Greeks were insisting that they 'would consider life unbearable if they were not allowed to celebrate those most sacred mysteries which unite the human race.' \"[Now] the work of those that pointed out the functions of mysteries as mind ‐ training and conditioning has, of course, evoked no answer for those who still think [that] the rituals are mere symbolic representations of knowledge or facts.\" [William Cooper]: And indeed they cannot admit this, simply because they would be admitting their own foolishness and stupidity in the process. So they will resist at all costs and continue to go to their meetings, for to do otherwise would be to confront their own fallibility, and in human nature that is one of the most difficult things for any individual to do. We all realize that. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"...It’s interesting to note[, folks,] that the ecstasy which is produced by excitatory methods and is followed by manipulation of the mind is still sought by members of many secret cults who are aware of the scientific explanation.\" [William Cooper]: You see, irregardless, even when they know this, they still seek it out. Because for them it fulfills some terrible need, way down deep inside their gut. \"There reaction is that the experience may well be induced by physical methods; but in spite of that [William Cooper: and this is what they say] 'it is nothing less than actual spiritual communion with a supernatural power.' This is the point [at which] scientists and mystics cannot agree. The mystic feels sure [that] he has experienced something sublime.\" [William Cooper: And who’s to say that they haven’t? Or, if you have not experienced it, you have no basis upon which to make a decision. But to experience it is to put yourself in a position to be controlled by others. So, we are in a quandary now. How do we explore this? \"The scientist tells [the mystic] that it is an illusion. He [just simply] will not believe it. The situation just reminds one of the time when someone produced the soul of a departed relative to tell a spiritualist, that there was no life after death. (Laughter) Although this is alleged to have happened in Ireland, one can visualize it taking place easily enough in the mutually heated atmosphere of scientist versus mystic anywhere [William Cooper: in the world]. \"The orgiastic side of the mysteries [also] has a place in the sphere of psychology. The catharsis ([or the] cleansing of the mind) which the secret cult of the Cathari experienced after ecstasy is paralleled by the modern therapist's procedure in bringing his patient to a state of excitement and [then] collapse before an implanting what he considers more suitable ideas in the mind. \"Christianity [of course] was not been behind in its use of the mystery ‐ system for initiates. [For] it was not until A.D. 692 that the every believer was ordered to be admitted to the worship of the Christians, following the period when it was thought advisable to celebrate certain parts of worship in secret.\" [William Cooper]: You see, Christianity in the beginning, was a secret society itself. And the correct name for it was the friendly, open secret society, although in the beginning there was nothing open about it. \"Traces of this survive in such customs as that of the Greek Orthodox Church, where the priest celebrates divine worship behind a curtain, which is only taken away during the elevation of the Host, 'since at that moment the worshipers prostrate themselves and are not supposed to see the holy sacrament.' \"The reason given for the secrecy of the practice of the Christian cult gives a clue in explaining that the celebrant must be prepared by expectation. St. Augustine laid down that secrecy was essential because: the mysteries of Christianity were incomprehensible to human intellect, and should not be derided by the uninitiated; secondly, because this secrecy produced greater veneration for the rites; thirdly, that the 'holy curiosity' of those to be initiated into the experience of Christianity should be increased, in order that they might attain to a perfect knowledge of the faith.\" [William Cooper]: And to you all, quite frankly, folks, in my study of mind control, the Christian church would swell, well beyond any conception or imagination of what their numbers could be, if they had continued their [laughter] secrecy. \"St. Basil ( De Spiritu Sancto , cap [let me see, that's 17? *note: it's actually 27.] xxvii) [William Cooper: that’s a writing, folks) tells how the Fathers of the Church 'were well instructed to preserve the veneration of the Mysteries in silence. For how could it be proper publicly to proclaim in writing the doctrine of those things which no unbaptized person may so much as may look upon?'\" [William Cooper]: Now this all sounds silly to us today. But believe me, folks, there is nothing silly about it. And if it were practiced today as it was then, the Christian church would be more powerful then you can possibly conceive. [William Cooper]: Now, remember, this is the results of our research. I myself consider myself to be a Christian. And that I follow the teachings, the words of Jesus Christ in my daily life. Not the dogma of any church, not the preaching of any minister or priest. But simply and only the words of Christ. Seated upon the foundation of that which God gave us in our history, the moral code called the Ten Commandments as they were originally given to Moses, and not as they were changed by man in the form of the Pope. \"The origin of mystery ceremonies seems to be India: or, at least, the place in time when the Brahman priesthood started its initiations. The ceremonies were based upon the Hindu myths; but the procedure followed in training the aspirant as strikingly similar in Egypt. And Egypt profoundly influenced Greece.\" 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Now what's left out here, and the reason it’s usually left out, is because any mention or discussion of the Babylonian Mysteries or the Babylonian religion is usually met with much criticism and derision by those who believe that it was a terrible institution. The Mysteries definitely came from the East, and the East in the Mysteries still survives today. When one Freemason greets another and he is not sure if he is really a Freemason, he will ask if he is a \"traveler\", or if he is \"traveling\" or if he is a \"fellow traveler\". All, I might add, were the same code of identification used by the Communist party in this country, because Communism and the Mysteries are the same entity, as are Socialism and the Mysteries. [William Cooper]: When they meet and this exchange takes place, the one being queried, if he is indeed a member of the Mystery Religion, will say, \"Yes, I’m a traveler,\" to which the first, or the inquirer, will respond with, \"Where are you going?\" or \"Where are you traveling, from where to where?\" And the answer will be, \"From west to east,\" for the east is the position of the rising sun, where the knowledge comes from. You see? For an early history, it certainly can be proven to have come from the east. And the sun was the symbol of the intellect . It began by being the symbol of the unseen god of the universe and slowly transformed into the symbol of the intellect, the light, Osiris, Ra, Lucifer. \"Prayer, fasting, and study were the first requirements, when the Indian candidate prepared himself for the trials which were before him, [William Cooper: All of this, folks, originated in Babylon at the dawn of civilization.] for the actual sight for the Great Gods, and the final 'word' ([or] teaching) which would be implanted in his mind when it had become sufficiently prepared to receive it. [And] if the weather was cold, he would have to sit in the snow or rain, naked. In the torrid heat, he sat in the full blaze of the sun with four fires built around him to give additional heat. This was the first part of the undertaking; while he repeated prayers and repetitions which included the invocation for his complete conversion. This latter concentration [folks] upon the desires of the candidate is applied in more than one of the mysteries. [William Cooper: Some of the initiations ceremonies were cruel and painful.] Coupled with the 'word' which is given during the ceremonies, it means that the power of suggestion is being applied continuously, and should penetrate into the mind at every moment when it is able to receive it. \"This period of dedication was succeeded by one in which he visited the underground cave of initiation.\" [William Cooper]: And when it wasn’t in a cave, it was in a tomb or a crypt, such as the pyramids of Egypt, which were never tombs of pharaohs, but were, from the beginning until the end of their use, they were temples of initiation. \"Passing through a tunnel of complete darkness, [the initiate] emerged into the cavern, where three priests, dressed as gods, awaited him in resplendent and intimidating array. After being addressed and partaking in the oration of prayers, [the initiate] walked rapidly around the temple several times [William Cooper: this called circumambulation] and was then carried through several subterranean and unlit caves. During this time there were wails[, wails, screams] and shouts from every side, while illuminated specters and other horrors abounded. At the end of this terrible experience, the aspirant came to two doors which, when thrown open to the sound of the sacred conch trumpet the conch [William Cooper: folks, is a shell], revealed a scene of brilliance and glory. This hall was full of every delight in the form of pictures, music, and perfume. [The initiate] walked to the altar in the room where he was again harangued, and presented with his sevenfold cord, which was marked his passing through the initiation. \"[Now,] if we compare these proceedings with those that were said to be carried out among the Egyptians, the parallelism is startling [even today]. The candidate was taken to a well, which he had to descend until it came to a tunnel. Torch in hand, he passed through a door, which closed with a resounding noise [William Cooper: as if never to be opened again]. He was met by frightful figures, which offered him a last chance of going back. [Then] he passed through a fire, swam through a dangerous underground stream. [And] as soon as he reached a door and touched a ring to open it, a blast of air blew out the lamp which gave the only available light. [Some type of] machine swung him over a bottomless pit. [And] just as he was on the point of exhaustion, and ivory door opened, and he found himself on the threshold of a resplendent Temple of Isis. Here the priests received him into their company. [He would go through a] series of tests, he had to undergo fasting and what would nowadays be called indoctrination, before he could be considered completely initiated into even the first degree. The foregoing experiences were followed by the higher degrees, those of Serapis and Osiris.\" [William Cooper]: And, in the process, the wives of the priests would tease him and cajole him and try to get him to make love to them. And if he had successfully resisted, then he could say that he had passed all the tests. But if he succumbed to their advances, he was not considered worthy. \"It is needless to outline the beliefs and methods used in the Chinese, Japanese, South American and other mysteries; because while the legends which are inculcated [may] vary [in some way ‐‐ they are all essentially and basically the same], the training hardly varies at all. The real mystery of the mysteries[, folks,] is how and when man first discovered and the use certain procedures to condition other men [William Cooper: and thus rule them and control them], and whether the discovery was instantaneous or gradual, or simultaneous or at different times or places. But one cannot date doctrines as one can archaeological finds, by radioactive carbon [dating]. [William Cooper]: And, so, you have reached another milestone in your education into the Mysteries. And this program has only half 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"completed. And, again, I must remind you we have just begun, for we are essentially covering six thousand years of the history of a hidden religion, known simply as the Mysteries. To Christians, it is Mystery Babylon; to others, it is called the Invisible College. In all cases, it belongs to those who consider themselves in possession of the only truly mature minds, and thus the only ones capable of knowing certain advancements in technology, sociology and many, many other things. They call themselves of the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages.\" And I can assure you, folks, they are in complete control of all elements of our society, military, and government at this time. So it is essential that you learn these facts about them and their organization, so that we can decide our future. [William Cooper]: Don't go away, folks. We've got to take a short break. I'll be right back after this pause. (break music: unknown, dramatic instrumental music) [continuing reading from: A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"The cult of Mithra, the intercessor between man and the Persian divine power Ormuzd, was once an extremely widespread one [William Cooper: for it is the original cult of the sun]. From its origins in Persia, the faith spread to Babylononia, Greece and finally the Roman Empire, where it struggled against Christianity at the latter’s inception. Christianity won, with the decline the material virtues of the Romans, but there are people who worship the solar deity [today], and even London has its Mithra temple. \"Mithra was said to give his worshipers success in this world as well as security and happiness in the next. [William Cooper: Sound familiar, Freemasons?] He was originally a genie, the worldly representative of the invisible power which ruled the affairs of men. Later (and the cult probably has a history of over six thousand years) he became thought of by his devotees as not being just one of the twenty ‐ eight genii, but the only one which mattered, and the only one who could cater to the wishes and needs of the people. Thus it was that the ancient Aryan worship of Ahura ‐ Mazda, the supreme being, was displaced by that of one of his representatives. Now, one way, folks, you can tell who, or which corporations, or which businesses, or societies belong to these cults, is look at these names. Such as Saturn, Mazda, etc. Ahura Mazda, the supreme being, was displaced by that of one of his representatives. Although archaeological research has produced little to give a clear picture of the rituals and beliefs of the Mithraists, a considerable amount of secret lore still survives in the east ‐‐ from India to Syria ‐‐ which gives one a good idea of exactly how the members of the cult thought, and [just exactly] what their magical ceremonies were. \"Three ritualistic objects are used by Mithraists: the crown (equivalent to the sun, and power of the supernatural kind), the hammer or club (symbolizing creative activity of mankind) and the bull, which stands for nature, virility, [and] increase. By the proper understanding of these objects and [just exactly] what they represent, Mithraists have it that the ordinary man can transcend his environment, can become great, or successful, or can achieve what he wants to do; and enters a delightful after ‐ life. What must he give in exchange? Nothing but worship to the principle which presides over all destiny [William Cooper: and control to the priests of the religion]. \" [William Cooper]: Now let’s regress just a moment, and let me explain to you why the bull. Throughout the ancient world you see the symbology of the bull. Now you have to remember, this history goes back six thousand years. The first two thousand, of which, looking back, is the Christian era. Now, remember, this is the age of Pisces, or the two fish. The six thousand year period started in antiquity when the sun was in Taurus, or the Bull. That is the meaning of Baal, the golden calf...was the representation of the house of the sun, or the age of the bull, or Taurus. It was really the same old Mystery Religion, the worship of the unseen God of the universe, represented by the sun which, over the centuries and the millennia, has become the worship of the intellect, with the sun the representation of the light, or Lucifer, the one who gave man the gift of intellect. [William Cooper]: Now after the age of Taurus came the Goat, or the Ram. And this was symbolized by the symbol of the goat, or the goat of Mendes, for in Mendes there was a temple erected to the worship of the Mysteries, and since the sun was in the house of the goat, or the ram, the object of the exoteric worship by the masses was the goat. [William Cooper]: When the sun passed into the house of Pisces, or the two fishes, the Christian era began. We are now on our way out of the age of Pisces into the age of Aquarius. Once you understand that the ancient religion was a religion of the worship of the heavens then everything begins to come together. And when you understand that they ceased believing in an all ‐ powerful unseen God, or hidden God of the universe, and became essentially pantheous (believing everything is God), they call this nature or the natural way. Then you can understand how man became to worship the intellect. The intellect. And the symbol that used to represent the unseen God of the universe came to represent the intellect. The use of which will bring man to the state of Apotheosis, where man himself will become God. And then you begin to look at all the things that are happening today and you see their symbology everywhere. Nowhere will you see it more prominently than in the Loony Tune fringe element calling themselves, \"Ufologists.\" You will see that everything to do with the so ‐ called UFO phenomena, comes right out of the Mystery Schools. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\"One reason[, folks,] for the loss of importance of the cult [of Mithras] undoubtedly is that admission was restricted to those who were thought worthy to receive the blessings which would come through the proper beliefs and use of the magical powers presided over by the Mithra priests. Christianity, for instance, was open to a far greater section of the population, even although the Christian mysteries were not accessible everywhere to all to until relatively late [in our history]. At the same time, some of the Mithras ceremonials were of such obvious emotional appeal that scholars are agreed, that the purely ritualistic side of Christianity owes much to those of the sun ‐ god of the Persians.\" [William Cooper]: And if you have been listening to this program, you already know that: that Christianity was actually merged with the religion of the worship of the sun into what is now known as the Vatican. \"The lowest degree of initiation was known as the Sacrament, and could be administered to anyone, theoretically, who could be relied upon to keep a secret, and would develop into a regular and devout worshiper This degree was called that of The Crow, and it symbolized, according to the present ‐ day Mithras, the death of the new member, from which he would arise reborn as a new man [William Cooper: and today The Crow is known as a phoenix]. This death [or symbolic death] spelt the end of his life as an unbeliever and canceled his allegiance to former and unaccepted beliefs. The use of the word ‘crow’ probably derives from the ancient Persian practice of exposing their dead to be eaten by carrion birds ‐‐ which is still carried on by the Parsi community in India, who follow parts of ancient Iranian religion as supposedly taught by Zoroaster. But if the crow symbolized death, it was also delegate privileged to take over the human body after death. [Of course,] in a sense, it was superior to humanity. Thus it was that the member of the cult was superior to the ordinary run of mortals.\" [William Cooper]: They believed themselves to be a separate race of man and still do. \"The candidate descended seven steps into the temple, which was an underground one, fashioned in the shape of a cavern, and made to look as much as possible like a natural cave. Initiation tests now took place. The newcomer was pursued by 'wild beasts' (priests in animal skins), 'demons' and all sorts of terrors. He had to fast for three days. [And] in this debilitated, altered and plastic state, he was given a lecture by a priest on the responsibilities which were now his. Among these were the necessity to call brother only those who had been initiated.\" [William Cooper]: In the words of a Freemason today, whose son I happen to know: \"If you are not one of us, you are nothing.\" Those words were spoken to his son when he asked his father why the Freemasons that he knew and his father were persecuting a local business man and trying to drive him out of business. Now, bear in mind that his son was not a Freemason. Let me say those words again for you, folks: \"If you are not one of us, you are nothing.\" \"All family ties were severed; nothing mattered but doing one’s job well and carrying out the worship of Mithra. The final ceremony took place amid the clash of cymbals, the beating of drums and the unveiling of a statue of Mithra himself. This latter showed Mithra as a man, carrying a bull by the hind legs. Now the symbolism of this piece of sculpture was explained to him. The bull, in addition to symbolizing fecundity, was representative of animal passion [William Cooper: and it was also the house in which the sun dwelt in the first two thousand years of the religion]. It was through invocations to Mithra that mankind first discovered how to overcome this force, and how to discipline himself. Therefore the secret of religion was partly that the worshiper must restrain himself physically in order to obtain power over himself and over others.\" [William Cooper]: And this is the mystery of the Sphinx that man has been trying to decipher since man discovered the Sphinx in the modern world. It is simply this: that man is nothing but an animal with a brain, with an intellect. It is to remind us, folks. It is to tell us that no matter what you think or how high you get, you are still nothing but an animal with an intellect. Period. \"This graphic teaching of the diversion of sexual power into psychic channels shows that the Mithraists followed in essence the pattern of all [Mystery Schools] which believed in the production of power through discipline. In this they are clearly distinguished from the more primitive and the less important of the orgiastic schools, which merely practiced indiscriminate indulgence, mass immorality and so on. \"The neophyte [in this initiation] then drank a little wine from the cymbal, to show that he realized that the cymbal is the means whereby ritual ecstasy comes, which puts him in touch with the 'higher powers'. \"[Now] two long lines of initiates knelt on either side of the low stone benches which traversed the crypt...\" [William Cooper]: Remember, George Bush was initiated in the crypt, or the tomb, at Yale University, into what is known as the Skull and Bones, the Russell Trust, the Brotherhood of death. 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"\"[Now, remember,] two lines of initiates knelt on either side of the low stone benches which traversed the crypt, [and] as the new member, accompanied by the priests who were initiating him, walked along the central isle for the Eating of the Bread. A number of pieces of dried bread were placed on a drum, similar to those which were being softly beaten by one of the priests. The candidate ate one morsel, signifying that he accepted Mithra as the source of his food. This bread, according to their beliefs, had been exposed to the rays of the sun to absorb some of its quality; and thus the worshiper was partaking of the nature of the sun itself in this ritual observance.\" [William Cooper]: But it goes deeper than that that, folks, because the sun is what enables all life to exist on this planet. Being that the planet is at the perfect balance, where it is neither too hot, nor too cold. And that the planet is tilted upon its axis, creating the seasons, which enable food to be grown in the more northern latitudes, than if the earth was stable on an axis where only one portion of the globe always was in direct alignment with the sun. Then it would be too hot at the equator; there would be one narrow band in the northern, southern hemisphere where crops could be grown; and it would be too cold in the northern and southern hemispheres. So, this ritual observance has scientific fact behind it, in that the bread, indeed, did come from the sun. \"[And] now [the initiate] was taught the password of the cult, which was to identify him to other members, and which he was to repeat to himself frequently, in order to maintain the thought always in his mind: 'I have eaten from the drum and drunk from the cymbal; and I have learned the secret of religion.' \"This is the cryptic phrase an early Christian writer, Maternus, reports as being taught to the Mithraists 'by a demon.' \"The second phase of initiation was called The Secret, and during this the candidate was brought to a state of ecstasy in which he was somehow made to believe that he had actually seen the statue of the god actually endowed with life. [Folks,] it’s not likely that there was any mechanical method by which this was done, because no such apparatus has been found in Mithraic temples unearthed. The candidate was brought up to the idol, to which he offered a loaf of bread and a cup of water. [And] this was to signify that he was a servant of the god, and that [he was] 'By what sustains my life I offer my entire life to your service.' The grade of Soldier may show that the military arts were responsible for a good deal of the power of Mithra worship in ancient Persia. Certain it is, in any case, that this degree greatly appealed to the Roman warriors who formed a very large part of the rank and file of the cult during its Western expansion. A sign similar to a cross, signifying the sun, was made on the forehead of the initiate, who was thus marked as being owned by the deity. A crown was placed before him, hanging from the point of a sword. This he took and placed it aside with the words: 'Mithra alone is my crown.'\" [William Cooper]: And this, folks, this takes place, in every, every mystery that there have ever been. Remember when Christ had went into the desert for forty days and forty nights and was tempted by Satan? Satan offered Him the crowns of any, or all, of the nations of the earth, if He [Christ] would just follow him [Satan]. And Christ rejected it. The same thing happens in the Mystery School: the initiate is always offered a crown, sometimes by the king or emperor himself. And if he accepts the crown, he is considered unworthy and, being as it would be interpreted as a threat to the real wearer of the crown, probably would have been executed. He was considered only worthy if he rejected the crown symbolic of the ruler, the ruling of the nation, or people, or area. \"The Persian crown, it will be remembered, from which pattern all present ‐ day crowns are eventually derived, is a golden sun ‐ disc with a hole in the centre for the head. [It’s] jagged at the edges (representing the sun’s rays) [William Cooper: just like that worn by the Statue of Liberty], and these projections are turned up, to make what is still known in Western heraldry as the Oriental crown.\" [William Cooper]: You can also see this representation as the halo in Christian art. \"Now the candidate has to prove himself in a mock combat with soldiers and animals in a number of caves. When the Emperor Commodus went trough this degree of initiation, he actually killed one of the participants, although he was supposed to only make a symbolic slaying. \"Passed through the Soldier degree, the Mithras was eligible, after a lapse of time, to be promoted to the rank of Lion. He was taken again to the cavern, and honey was smeared upon his brow, as opposed to water that had been used in his acceptance into the earlier degree ‐‐ his 'baptism.' The degree of Lion was taken only by those who had decided to dedicate themselves completely to the cult, and who would henceforth have no truck with the ordinary world. The Lion was then, a sort of priest, but rather more of a monk. He was trained into the rites of the cult and told certain secrets. \"The degree of Lion of Mithras could only be conferred only when the sun was occupying [in] the Zodiacal sign of Leo ([and that is] about July 21st to August 20th) during the Persian month of Asad, The Lion. [Now,] there is a good deal of astrological lore in Mithraism, and also an admixture with cabbalistic numerology. The Greek branch of the Mithraists, for example, worked out that the numerical equivalent of the name (spelt by them Mitrus) was 365, and thus corresponded [of] the days in the solar year.\" 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Well, since the deity was the sun, then this is exactly what it should have been. \"In the purely magical sense, Mithraism has it that both the name of the god and the rank which the individual holds in the cult have magical power. Thus, if a person wants to achieve anything, he has to concentrate upon the word 'Mithra', while preparing for himself the ceremonial repast and beating alternately a drum and cymbals. \"That the effect of initiation was to produce someone of an upright character is amply evidenced by literature of Roman times, in which the Mithraists were generally considered to be thoroughly trustworthy and improved people. Even their enemies could reproach their own followers [that showed the] vitality of the Mithras creed. Tertullian, in his De Corona [William Cooper: which is Latin for, 'The Crown'], which he composed in the third Christian Century, upbraids the Christians, inviting their attention to the Mithrists as examples:\" [William Cooper: De Corona actually means, \"the Crown of Thorns.\" \"'You, his fellow ‐ warriors, should blush when exposed by any soldier of Mithra. When he is enrolled in the cave, he is offered the crown, which he spurns. And he takes his oath upon this moment, and [he] is to be believed. Through the fidelity of his servants the devil puts us to shame,' [he said.] \"[Now] there were seven degrees of initiation in all, although there are some branches of the ecstatic side of the lore which includes certain others, making the total twelve. After Lion came the Persian, then the Runner of the Sun, then Father, and finally, Father of Fathers. The twelfth degree, it is said, is King of Kings, [William Cooper: and where have we heard that before?] and properly, this can be held only by the supreme king, and preferably the Shahinshah (King of Kings) of Persia. \"This very ancient cult, from which more than one present ‐ day secret society [is] derived, is thus seen to contain many of the elements which underlie organizations of this sort. [You see folks,] it is a training system; it attempts to produce in its members a real or imagined experience of contact with some supreme power. The magical element is there too, shown in the belief in the power of certain names to achieve things which cannot be done by men. Mithraism was not an anti ‐ social society, in the sense that it did not conflict in its aims with the objectives of the countries in which it flourished. And hence it did not threaten the established order. It was tolerant of other creeds.\" [William Cooper]: Just like Freemasonry is now. You can belong to any religion and join at the lowest level. But I guarantee you that, when you reach the highest level, you will only belong to one religion. \"[The tolerance] of other creeds...meant that [it] did not intend to supplant them. Its greatest festival, the Birth of the Sun, on the 25th of December, became Christianized; and it is claimed by those that still believe in the mysteries and celebrate them, that Christianity did not so much supplant Mithraism as absorb it, accepting some of its externals and diverting to its own use [William Cooper: and that is exactly what has happened]. Perhaps incongruously, a present ‐ day follower of Mithra in England recently likened this phenomenon to the eclipse of the Liberal Party, 'because the two other Parties have taken over its objectives, and widened the basis. Only the actual initiates of Mithra know what has been lost in the process.' So the young man in the Phrygian bonnet, sometimes seen as the conqueror of the bull, or even as a man with a lion's head, still has his devotees. And [folks] the sun still shines.\" [William Cooper]: So, what does all this got to do with stars and stardust? Many people believe that Venus is the morning star and, in the ancient days, they say that it was Sirius that rose before the sun with a red cast to it, and then turned a brilliant white as it rose up into the heavens. Well, folks, if you really think about it, the sun is the morning star. Good night, and God bless each and every one of you.

I'm William Cooper. Many of you have written letters and asked, “How does one get into the Mystery Schools since no one ever hears anything about it? And there appears not to be a campaign of recruitment,” and you're absolutely right. In our research, we have found the requirements to be simple: be of sound mind and body, have a sincere desire to be illumined, and simply knock up on the door. (Opening music: Opening theme from Phantom of the Opera ) Remember folks, Monday, March 5...(William Cooper plugs an appearance, asks for donations to stay on the air and offers CAJI memberships) Well, to continue...remember that the first religion in the world was the religion of the worship of the heavens. And man eventually came to recognize the sun as the representation of the power and the ability of the hidden god of the universe. The invisible god of the universe, the all ‐ powerful creator of everything. But man, as he gained his intellectual ability, began to look toward himself, toward the intellect as that god. And the sun, the representation of what used to be the invisible god of the universe then because the representation of the intellect, the light, Lucifer. And man began to worship the Luciferian philosophy. He believed ‐‐ these people who call themselves the \"Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages,\" and still believe ‐‐ that man was held prisoner in the Garden of Eden by an unjust, vindictive and very cruel God, the God of the Bible. And that he was set free from the bonds of ignorance through the gift of intellect, given to him by Lucifer through his agent, Satan. Now, many people believe that Lucifer and Satan are the same individual entity, and they may be. I don't know the answer to that, I just know what the Mystery Schools believe, and I know what I personally believe and what I personally believe doesn't have any bearing on anything. Knowledge, the truth, is what counts, and that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of here. Now, eventually this philosophy of worshiping the intellect, or wisdom, or the mind became known as Gnosticism . And the followers of Gnosticism began to be known as the Gnostics. (Reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul): \"In extraordinary number [folks] of exceedingly bizarre talismans and inscribed stones bear witness to the power of the secret Gnostic organizations which flourished in various forms during the few centuries immediately before and after the rise of Christianity in the Middle East. [You see,] one of the oddest emblems of these schools was the figure of Abraxas. [Now, that's] a human body clothed in a Roman soldier's garb wielding a battle ‐ axe, as if threatening an enemy. [Now] in its left hand it carried an elliptical shield, upon which the words of power 'IAO' and 'Sabaoth' were sometimes written. The head of this fearsome being was that of a cock with open beak. [William Cooper: Now, that symbolized the rising of the morning sun, because the cock crows with the sunrise.] For legs, it had twin serpents [William Cooper: The serpent throughout history has always been a symbol for wisdom, the gift of intellect], coiling to either side. Underneath the figure sometimes lay a conventionalized thunderbolt. \"[Now] who was Abraxas? His name, in accordance with cabalistic computation, is decoded to mean 'three hundred and sixty ‐ five' ‐‐ [William Cooper: Isn't it absolutely incredible that every single time we investigate one of these, it leads directly to the sun. For three 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"hundred and sixty ‐ five days are] the number of days in the year. [William Cooper: or the exact number of days that it takes for the earth to make one revolution around the sun. Amazing!] There was no god or idol belonging to the society. [William Cooper: And this is where man made the transition from worshiping a god to worshiping the mind.] The Abraxas figure merely represented the aspects for power which went to make up the supreme intelligence, the all ‐ power. The body was man himself; the bird stood for intelligence, and the hailing of light [illumination] which is the cock's habit at dawn. The tunic represented the need for struggle [or revolution, Socialism], the arms the protection and power given by the dedication to the Gnosis – [or] knowledge. The shield was wisdom, the club or whip, power. The two snakes meant nous , insight, [or] logos , understanding. [William Cooper: primordial knowing, which was the gift from Satan, the snake, the serpent.] \"By means of this diagram Gnostic teachers inculcated the theory that man comes to his power by developing certain facets of his mind. He must struggle to arrive at gnosis ; but this knowledge if of the mystical kind and it is not the mere collection of facts. [You see] great stress was laid upon personal mystical experience, to and through which the initiate was guided under conditions of great secrecy. \"The Gnostics did not confine their studies, or their teachings, to anyone of religion, but borrowed illustrations from all that were accessible to them. This caused them to be considered Christian, heretics, Jews, who were trying to undermine Christianity, remnants of the Persian sun ‐ worshipers. They have been widely studied by early Christian sages, and it is upon the opinions of these latter that many conclusions have been formed. Little or no investigation of these 'People of Wisdom' has been done by research workers on the spot ‐‐ in Asia and North Africa ‐‐ where strong and interesting traces of their beliefs and practices still remain. \"The main teaching states that there is a Supreme Being, or power which is invisible and has no perceptible form [William Cooper: it is pantheism ]. This power is the one which can be contacted by mankind, and it is through it that man can control himself and work out his destiny. The various religious teachers through the ages, putting on their creeds in many different ways, were in contact with this power [they claim], and their religions all contain a more or less hidden kernel of initiation. [Now] this is the secret which the Knowers can communicate to their disciples. But the secret can be acquired only through exercising the mind and body until the terrestrial man is so refined as to able to become a vehicle for the use of this power [William Cooper: or, in their terms, 'illumined']... \"...Eventually, the initiate becomes identified with the power, and in the end he obtains his true destiny as purified personality, infinitely superior to the rest of unenlightened mankind [William Cooper: to the state of Apotheosis , where he himself is god]. \"The symbolism in which this teaching is concealed, the methods by which the mystical power is attained, vary from one Gnostic society to another. But the constant factor is there: the attainment of that which humankind unconsciously needs. [You see] the Gnostic claims that within every man and woman, there is an unfulfilled urge which cannot be given expression in the normal way because there is social means by which it can be fulfilled. This feeling has been put into man in order that he may seek the fulfillment which the Gnostics can give him. His search for completeness in love, trade, professions, theology is vain and unsuccessful. \"The theories of the various schools [folks] of Gnosticism with which the Christian clerics came into contact are very much secondary to the [rituals and] practices which are used to produce the Gnosis, the enlightenment [the illumination]. This has not been fully understood by too many [people], who devote much space to trying to work out the beliefs of the Knowers by a perusal of their writings, or by reports which had been given them by others.\" [William Cooper]: Simply, folks, because they do not understand the symbolism. It is not clear to them; it is veiled. It is the esoteric wisdom. \"What were ‐‐ and are ‐‐ the Gnostic practices? [Well] first, discipleship and the inculcated belief that the initiate must struggle, must devote himself as much as possible to the identification with the power which inspires all. Secondly, there are two kinds of men, those who are bound to the earth and matter, and those who can refine themselves. It is from the latter class that the aspirants are chosen [William Cooper: they claim. In every instance that we investigated, they many choose them from the latter class, but they all end up in the first]. Thirdly, the methods by which the divine illumination may come are many and varied; and it is the providence of the teacher to choose which path he will give to his disciple to follow. Some Gnostics believed that frenzy and excitement would produce the necessary liberation of the mind from the fetters of the body [William Cooper: Remember the sphinx?]; others [consider] that this could be done best by fasting and meditation. Present ‐ day Gnostic practice in the East has it that different methods suit different temperaments: and this [could] be one cause for the historical confusion as to which branch of 'heretics' practiced what. \"The Gnostics believed themselves to be intellectual aristocrats: their knowledge was only for the few who were ready to receive it. [William Cooper: And that's why they do not recruit. You must knock at the door. And you, and only you, know when you ready to receive it.] And this is what made them a secret cult, not the fear of persecution. They had their own passwords, in shaking hands they tickled the palm as an identification signal, and they helped one another in every conceivable way.\" [William Cooper]: Just as Freemasons do today, for they are one and the same, as they have always been one and the same with all the 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"different versions of the Mystery throughout the ages. \"[Now some say that] they could not pantheists...that the doctrine was secondary to the experience of religion; and the theologians and ordinary priesthood of any religion did not approval of that. They were not, in fact, a religion like most others, because they stressed the importance of the individual before that of the community. Those who were more enlightened were more important in every possible way, because they were valuable, refined, aristocrats. At the same time they taught that providing the wellbeing of the Gnostics was assured, so was that of the community at large. [And] this meant that they could subscribe to the outward doctrines of any religion, and could continue to operate under many different politico ‐ religious systems. Gnosticism profoundly influenced men's minds even in Europe up to and after the Middle Ages, and its basic way of thinking is probably an underlying factor in other secret societies whose members would be surprised to know it.\" [William Cooper]: Because the pyramidal, organizational structure of membership of these organizations means that nobody below the top, the very top, really knows anything of the true religion and goals of the society to which they belong. And so these people could truly be said to be the greatest group of followers and fools in the history of the world. For they think that they are illumined, but, in fact, they were never given any real secrets, and only those at the top truly know what is really going on. \"Terrible obscenities and other crimes have been laid at the door of the Gnostics by the early ecclesiastical writers. Although there is little doubt that some of them did believe in mass ecstasy, it seems unlikely that their secrets were well enough known to enable the commentators to assess them.\" [William Cooper]: And in most cases whenever the commentators try to assess them, they were trying to assess the exoteric, or the appearance, but not the esoteric, or the real truth of the object of the worship of the Gnostics. The belief that certain special men could control their destiny and obtain extra powers thought dedication to Gnostic practices meant that, inevitably, there was a belief in magic. [William Cooper]: Remember on previous shows we discussed that belief in magic? Magic is real, folks. I have seen it work, and it is not to be played with or laughed at or scoffed about. It is dangerous, extremely dangerous. \"The myriad Gnostic 'gems' (inscribed stones) decorated with serpents, cabbalistic names and the rest, are more likely to be proofs of initiation and talismans than mere identification tokens presented to ensure admission to meetings, as some authors have thought. The reason for supposing this is that (1) the 'gems' are very similar in many respects to talismans in use by other communities [William Cooper: including the ancient Egyptians]; and (2) they can often be interpreted as containing magical messages or 'diagrammatical invocations'. \"Ethically speaking, Gnostic belief is that there are two principles: that of good and that of evil. A balance must be struck between these forces; and the balance is in the hands of the Gnostic ‐‐ the Knower ‐‐ partly because nobody else can tell whether an action is for the eventual good of the individual or the community. [And] this secret knowledge comes through the mystical insight which the supermen ‐ Gnostics attained.\" [William Cooper]: There's that reference to a super ‐ race or a \"superman\" again, which always crops up with these people, as it did with Hitler and many others. \"The rise of individuals who wrongly believed that they had attained to Gnosis ‐‐ all knowledge ‐‐ some of whom were leaders of Gnostic societies, produced notorious characters. Those who followed the way of the Ophite branch glorified the serpent who tempted Eve [William Cooper: and they still do that today]. They did this because this snake by his actions brought knowledge into the world. [William Cooper: Gave man the gift of intellect, the use of which will bring him to the state of Apotheosis , where man himself will be God.] \"...Basilides was a leader who taught that Jesus did not die on the cross. [William Cooper: And you will see this crop up all through the history of the Mystery Schools, even in the Knights Templar.] Since matter and material things were considered to be a part of the inferior, non ‐ spiritual world, the sect known as the Cainites called upon everyone to destroy those things which belonged to the world. [William Cooper: And they called themselves 'the destroyers,' and their god is the Destroyer.] \"These deviations and aberrants have attracted the greatest attention – as is natural – and the quieter teachers of the creed have received less attention. The pious horror with which the less respectable Gnostics were viewed by the early Christian father has stamped itself for ever on Western literature and belief about the ['Enlightened Ones']. But, in more than one place in the Middle East, as well as in small groups in Western Europe, there are still followers of various schools of Gnosticism. They mainly follow the ideas held by Valentinus, with some variations. [And] this school teaches its initiates that matter is more evil than good; that man must be purified by mental concentration; that after death man will rejoin that from which he has been severed, and will be unified with those whom he 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"loves [William Cooper: in the Great Intelligence ]. They also believe that all matter will eventually be destroyed by fire.\" [William Cooper]: And if they have their way, that could be absolutely true. \"The Mandaeans, a small but tenacious community which dwells in Iraq, follow an ancient form of Gnosticism, which practices initiation, ecstasy and some rituals which have been said to resemble those of the Freemasons.\" [William Cooper]: And of course they do, because they are. (laughs) In every Masonic temple you will see somewhere up on the wall a big letter 'G'. And you will see it in their symbology, in their books. You will see this letter 'G'. And if you ask a Freemason, being bound by the oath never to tell you or reveal you the secrets to the profane ‐‐ which is what they call those who are not initiates, or adepts in the Mysteries ‐‐ he will tell you it's for God, but that is a lie. That does not stand for God, for I have researched it deeply, all the way up the ladder of the stages of initiation. And at the top, those adepts known as the Priesthood know this large letter 'G' to represent Gnosticism. And it is an admission that they are indeed the recipients of the ancient Gnostic. They are Gnostics, and they are looking to attain the gnosis , through which they will receive Apotheosis . And they believe that they are the only ones in the world who possess truly mature minds and, thus, the only ones in the world capable of ruling the rest of us, whom they refer to as cattle. Cattle. [William Cooper]: Well, it's time to take a break, folks. Don't go away, I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: Overture to Sleuth , written by John Addison) That was Overture to Sleuth , conducted by Erich Kunzel, the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. Cincinnati is the home of the order of Cincinnatus and the Knights of the Golden Circle. You see, everything that I do on this show has meaning ‐‐ even the music, folks. Now, whether you like the music or not makes no difference. Listen to the words . Research the title. Try to find out what the music means before you condemn it. And remember that you're not the only one out there. Your age group is not the only age group listening. So, whether you like the music or not, it doesn't make any difference. It all has a message. All has a message, folks, and I hope you get the message, for it is extremely important that you do. \"[The] most detailed account on what was said to be the seven highest degrees of secret Egyptian initiation was first published in Germany in the eighteenth century. This strange and very exhaustive document combines many elements from the ancient mysteries...It seems to come from Greek sources, because many of the words used are Greek; and it [could] well be that we have here the modern beginnings of an attempted revival of ancient mysteries. Whatever [it is], it is not one of those fanciful and spurious ones which used to be printed merely to attract the credulous: because it is plausible in containing the sort of material which might well have formed the content of an initiation and mind ‐ conditioning system.\" [William Cooper]: And if you understand the secret religions as I do, and specifically the modern ones, you will quickly recognize this as authentic. \"The earliest version known is in the form of an anonymous pamphlet (probably not intended for public sale) or thirty ‐ odd pages, [which was] printed in 1785. (laughs) [William Cooper: Right in that area of history is momentous occurrences [sic].] It was republished in a French translation thirty years later, purporting to be the ritual of the Master degree in Freemasonry. [William Cooper: And if you know anything about the Master degree in Freemasonry, you will soon see that it's certainly (laughs) is exact in its description.] The French editor claims that it is a composite ritual, derived from the works of some fifteen Greek and Roman writers. \"This degree, we are told, was open to Egyptian kings and priests alone; and only those specially recommended by an initiate could enter it. The usual procedure was that the Pharaoh himself introduced the candidate to the priests. By them he sent from Heliopolis [William Cooper: the city of the Sun, and you will never escape from the sun when you're studying the mysteries] to the Memphis priests; from there we went to Thebes. He was circumcised, forbidden to eat pulse or fish; and generally had to abstain from wine. He was put for several months in an underground cave, and asked to write down his reflections. [After] he had done this, he was led to a passage supported by the pillars of Hermes where he had to learn certain things which were inscribed thereon. As soon as he was word ‐ perfect, the Themorphous (introducer) came to him with a strong whip, to keep the uninitiated at bay. He was blindfolded, and his hands bounds with cords. \"Now follow the procedure from the first degree of this elect body. The candidate was led to the Gate of Men, where the introducer touched the shoulder of an apprentice (Portophorus) standing there on guard. He in turn knocked on the gate, which was opened. When the aspirant entered, he was questioned on various matter by the Hierophant, after which he was led around the Birantha in an artificial storm of wind, rain, thunder and lightning. If he showed no sign of fear, Menies the Expounder explained the laws of the Crata Repoa, to which he had to agree. He was then taken in front of the Hierophant, made to kneel, and vowed fidelity with a sword ‐ point at this 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"throat. As witnesses he called upon the sun, moon and stars.\" [William Cooper]: And where have you heard that before? \"'His eyes were then unbandaged, and he was placed between two spare pillars, called Betilies, where lay a ladder of seven steps, behind which were with doors of different metals of gradually increasing purity. The Hierophant then addressing those present as Mene Musae , or children of the Work of Celestial Investigation, exhorted them to govern their passions and fix their thoughts upon God.'\" [William Cooper]: Now the sun, the moon and the stars, you should know by now, represent the doctrine, the church, and the initiates. The sun, of course, is the doctrine, the moon is the church, and the stars are the body of initiates, or the \"thousand points of light.\" \"The candidate was taught [folks] that the ladder symbolized the wanderings of the soul; he was told the causes of wind, thunder and lightning; and given other valuable information, such as medial lore. He was given the password of recognition of this degree, which was [William Cooper: and I spell it because I don't know the correct pronunciation...A ‐ M ‐ O ‐ U ‐ N], meaning secrecy. He was taught a grip, given a pyramidal cap and an apron called Xylon. Around his neck was a collar; and he word no other clothes. His duty was to guard the Gate of Men in his turn. \"The Portophorus was now able, after showing his devotion, to proceed to the Second Degree. Following a prolonged fast he was taken to a dark chamber called Endimion, the invitation grotto. He was now of the degree of Neocoris. 'Handsome women brought him dainty food; they were the wives of the priests, who endeavored to excite his love.' \"If he resisted these advances, he was further lectured by the Master of Ceremonies and led into an assembly, where the Stolista ([or] water ‐ bearer) poured water over him. Then a living serpent was thrown at him. The whole room was full of snakes, to test his courage. 'He was then led to two high pillars between stood a griffin driving a wheel before him. The pillars symbolized East and West, the griffin the sun and the wheel of four spokes the four seasons. He was taught the use of the level and instructed in geometry and architecture. He received a rod, entwined by serpents [William Cooper: and that rod is still used today by the medical community. It's called the caduceus ] and [he received] the password HEVE ([meaning] serpent), and was told the story of the fall of man. The sign consisted in crossing the arms over the chest [and] his duty was to wash the pillars. \"[Now when the initiate] was initiated into the Third Degree, the member was given the title of Melanophoris. He was led to an anteroom, over whose door was written 'Gate of Death'. The room was full of copies of embalmed bodies and coffins. Here too were a number of dissectors, embalmers and so on. \"'In the centre stood the coffin in Osiris. The Melanophoris was asked if he had had a hand in the assassination of his master. On his denying the question , he was seized by two Tapizeites, or men who buried the dead, and led into a hall, where he found all the other Melanophores clothed in black. The King himself, who always was present on these occasions, addressed him in an apparently friendly way, begin him if he did not feel courage enough to undergo the test no to be applied to him, to accept the golden crown he was offering him.' \"[Well] he had already been coached to refuse the crown and tread it underfoot. At this 'insult' the King called for revenge. Raising his sacrificial axe he touched the head the initiate.\" [William Cooper]: And in one famous initiation, the King actually beheaded the man. \"The two corpse ‐ carriers threw him to the ground, and the embalmers wrapped him in bandages. All who were present wept. Now he was led to a gate over which was written Sanctuary of the Spirits .\" [William Cooper]: Now, the initiate was not supposed to be beheaded in that one famous initiation. And I don't know what they chalked that up to. Now, standing before the gate, the initiate waited. \"'On its being opened, thunder and lightning struck the apparently dead man. Charon received him as a spirit into hit boat and carried him to the judges of Hades. Pluto sat on his judgment seat, while Rhadamanthus and Minos as well as Aethon, Nycreus, Alaster and Orpheus stood beside him. Very severe questions were put to him as to his former life and finally he was sentenced to remain in these subterranean vaults.'\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, this was an initiation which sometimes lasts for months, and even years. \"The bandages were removed, and he was told never to desire blood, never to leave a corpse unburied; and to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the judgment to come.\" 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Now remember, this was long ...centuries before Christianity. \"He was taught coffin ‐ decoration and the peculiar hierogrammatical script. The sign was an embrace, to express the 'days of wrath'. He was kept in these underground chambers until thought fit to proceed to a higher degree. \"These 'Days of Wrath' generally lasted for a year and a half, until the initiate was ready for promotion to the Fourth Degree: 'The Battle of the Shades'. He was handed a sword and a shield and taken though dark passages. He met 'certain persons, presenting a frightful appearances, carrying torches and serpents\". He was attacked, with the cry of PANIS! He defended himself bravely, but was [always] taken prisoner, his eyes were bandaged and a cord placed around his neck. Dragging him into a hall, the specters disappeared. He was led into the assembly of initiates, and his eye unbandaged. Before him saw a magnificent hall, decorated with beautiful paintings; the King and the highest dignitary ‐‐ the Demiurgos ‐‐ were present. \"All were wearing their Alydei, and Egyptian Order composed of sapphires. Among those present were the Secretary, the Treasurer and the Master of Feats. The Orator made a speech, congratulating the new member on his fortitude. He was given a drink, called Cyce, which he drank to the dregs. This was probably the ritual drink of honey or milk, water, wine and gruel ‐‐ and perhaps some hypnotic drug. He donned the boats of Anubis, took up the shield of Isis, put on the cloak and cap of Orcus. He was handed a sword and told that he must cut off the head of the next person he met in a cave and bring it back to the King. \"This cave was pointed to him. Entering it, he saw that seemed to be a beautiful woman, but in reality was a model of one. [William Cooper: And notice it's a woman.] He seized this by the hair and severed the head. This he brought back to the monarch, who praised him, telling him that he had symbolically won the head of the Gorgon, wife of Typhon, who had caused the death of Osiris. He was not permitted always to wear the dress which had been given to him, and he was entered in a book as one of the judges of the land. [William Cooper: Notice that: one of the judges of the land.] He was able to communicate at any time with the King, and received an allowance from the court. He was invested with an Order (that of Isis in the shape of an owl) and it was revealed to him that the secret name of the lawgiver was 'JOA', which was also the password of this Degree. But the password for the meetings of the Christophori (as the Fourth Degree initiates were called) was 'SASYCHIS'. \"The Fifth Degree, that of Balahate, could not now be refused to the Christophoru. He was led to a hall to watch a play, at which he was the only onlooker. Other members of the degree went through the hall, as if looking for something. One drew this sword, and the terrible figure of Typhon appeared. [Of course] he was slain. Now the new Balahate was told that Typhon represented fire, a terrible element which was at the same time indispensable. The password was 'CHYMIA', and the teaching was in chemistry [or alchemy]. \"In order to become an 'Astronomer at the Gate of the Gods' ‐‐ the Sixth Degree ‐‐ the candidate was taken to the hall of assembly, bound, and led to the Gate of Death. He was shown corpses which had been cast into water, and warned that he might be similarly treated if he broke his oath. He was given some teaching in astronomy, and taken back to the Gate of the Gods, where he looked at the pictures of the gods while their histories were explained to him. A priestly dance took place, symbolizing the course of the heavenly bodies; he saw a list of members of the Order throughout the world, and learned the password: 'IBIS', for watchfulness. \"The last and the highest degree was that of 'Propheta', in which all secrets were laid bare. It was conferred following public processions, and when the permission of the King and all the highest members had been obtained. The members secretly left the city by night, 'and retired to some houses built in a square and surrounded by pillars by the sides of which were placed alternately a shield and a coffin, whose rooms were painted with representations of human life'. [Now] these houses were called maneras , for the people believed them to be visited by the manes of departed men. On their arrival at these houses the new member, now called prophet or Saphennath Pancah (a man who knows the secrets), was given a drink called oimellas and told that now all trials were over. He received a cross of peculiar significance, which he was always to wear. He was clothed in a wide, white ‐ striped dress, called etangi . The usual sign was crossing his arms in his wide sleeves. He could peruse all the sacred books written in the Ammonite language...his greatest privilege was having a vote in the election of a king [and] the password was 'ADON'.\" (Reading from Behold A Pale Horse , written by Milton William Cooper) \"These mystical societies always continued, and one of special interest is the powerful society of Afghanistan in ancient times called the Roshaniya ‐‐ illuminated ones. The major tenets of this cult were: the abolition of private property; the elimination of religion; the elimination of nation states; the belief that illumination emanated from the Supreme Being who desired a class of perfect men and women to carry out the organization and direction of the world; belief in a plan to reshape the social system of the world by first taking control of individual countries one by one, and the belief that after reaching the fourth degree one could communicate directly with the unknown supervisors who had imparted knowledge to initiates throughout the ages... 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"\"...The Roshaniya also called themselves the Order. Initiates took an oath that absolved them of all allegiance except to the Order and stated, 'I bind myself to perpetual silence and unshaken loyalty and submission to the Order... All humanity which cannot identify itself by our secret sign is our lawful prey.' The oath remains essentially the same to this day. The secret sign was to pass a hand over the forehead, palm inward; the counter ‐ sign, to hold the ear with the fingers and support the elbow in the cupped other hand. Does [that] sound familiar?\" [William Cooper]: If you sit in a courtroom in just about any city in this land, you will see those signs exchanged between lawyers and defendants and judges. And you will see that whenever that...these signs are exchanged, whoever initiated the exchange will usually, in fact, most often does, win the court case. \"The Order [of course] is the Order of the Quest. [And] the cult preached [there was no heaven and no hell, only] a spirit state completely different from life as we know it. The spirit could continue to be powerful on earth through a member of the Order, but only if the spirit had been itself a member of the Order before its death. Thus members of the Order gained power from the spirits of the dead members. \"The Roshaniya took in travelers as initiates and then sent them on their way to found new chapters of the Order.\" [William Cooper]: and they were called 'fellow travelers’. You see, this order, as all before it, and all since, are Socialist, Communists. \"It is believed by some that the Assassins were a branch of the Roshaniya. Branches of the Roshaniya or 'the illuminated ones' or the Illuminati existed and still exist everywhere. One of the rules was not to use the same name and never mention 'the Illuminati.' That rule is still in effect today [and it's probably] the breaking of [that] rule that resulted in Adam Weishaupt’s downfall.\" [William Cooper]: Remember, folks, that we have really only just begun. And you are just beginning to understand, although some of you may think that you do already understand. I can assure you that may be only a very small minority of you really do. Most do not. We have a long way to go in this history and in your own particular, individual illumination. (laughs) Oh, I just love it! I just love it; exposing these people who claim that they are doing everything for the benefit of mankind, who really have all the guilt of everything bad that has ever happened to mankind squarely upon their shoulders. [William Cooper]: Now, if you'd like a packet of information, if you would like to know how to join CAJI, if you'd like to purchase my book, or if you would like to donate... (William Cooper asks for donations to stay on the air and offers CAJI memberships) Next time, folks, we're going to talk about the Old Man of the Mountain. And we're going to continue the history of the order through the ages. Good night, and may God bless you all.

(opening music: In the Hall of the Mountain King , written by Edvard Grieg) [Reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"Two men in the year 1092 stood on the ramparts of a medieval castle ‐‐ the Eagle's Nest ‐‐ perched high upon the crags of the Persian mountains: the personal representative of the Emperor and the veiled figure who claimed to be the incarnation of God on earth. Hasan, son of Sabah, Sheikh of the Mountains and leader of the Assassins, spoke: 'You see that devotee standing guard on yonder turret ‐ top? Watch!' \"He made a signal. Instantly the white ‐ robed figure threw up his hands in salutation, and cast himself two thousand feet into the foaming torrent which surrounded the fortress. \"'I have seventy thousand men ‐‐ and women ‐‐ throughout Asia, [and] each one of them ready to do my bidding. Can your master, Malik Shah, say the same? And he asks me to surrender to his sovereignty! This is your answer. Go!' \"[Now] such a scene may be worthy of the most exaggerated of horror films. And yet it took place in historical fact. The only quibble made by the chronicler of the time was that Hasan's devotees numbered 'only about forty thousand.' How this man Sabah came by his uncanny power, and how his devotees struck terror into the hearts of men from the Caspian to Egypt, is one of the most extraordinary of all tales of secret societies [William Cooper: the Mysteries]. Today, the sect of the Hashishin ([or] druggers) still exists in the form of the Ismailis ([or] Ishmaelites), whose undisputed chief, endowed by them with divine attributes, is the Aga Khan. \"Like many another secret cult, the Assassin organization was based upon an earlier association. [And] in order to understand how they worked and what their objectives were, we must begin with these roots. \"It must be remembered [William Cooper: dear listeners] that the followers of Islam in the seventh century A.D. split into two divisions: the orthodox, who regard Mohammed as the bringer of divine inspiration; and the Shiahs, who consider that Ali, his successor, the Fourth Imam ([or] leader), was more important. It is with the Shiahs that we are concerned here. \"From the beginning of the split in the early days of Islam, the Shiahs relied for survival upon secrecy, organization and initiation. Although the minority party in Islam, they believed that they could overcome the majority (and eventually the whole world) by superior organization and power. To this end they started a number of societies which practiced secret rites in which the personality of Ali was worshipped, and whose rank and file were trained to struggle above all for the accomplishment of world dominion. \"One of the most successful secret societies which the Shiahs founded was centered around the Abode of Learning in Cairo, which was the training ‐ ground for fanatics who were conditioned by the most cunning methods to believe in a special divine mission. In order to do this, the original democratic Islamic ideas had to be overcome by skilled teachers, acting under the orders of the Caliph of the Fatimites, who ruled Egypt at that time. \"Members were enrolled, on the understanding that they were to receive hidden power and timeless wisdom which would enable them 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"to become as important in life as some of the teachers.\" [William Cooper]: ...and you find that these same precepts in every branch, in every nationality, on every continent where the Mysteries prevail. \"The Caliph saw to it that the instructors were no ordinary men. The supreme judge was one of them; another was the commander ‐ in ‐ chief of the army; a third the minister of the Court. There was no lack of applicants. In any country where the highest officials of the realm formed a body of teachers, one would find the same thing. \"Classes were divided into study groups, some composed of men, others of women, collectively termed Assemblies of Wisdom. All lessons were carefully prepared, written down and submitted to the Caliph for his seal. At the end of the lecture all present kissed the seal: for did the Caliph not claim direct descent from Mohammed, through his son ‐ in ‐ law Ali and thence from Ismail, the seventh Imam? He was the embodiment of divinity, far more than any Tibetan lama ever was. \"The university, lavishly endowed and possessing the best manuscripts and scientific instruments available, received a grant of a quarter of a million gold pieces annually from the Caliph. Its external form was similar to the pattern of the ancient Arab universities, not much different from Oxford. But its real purpose was the complete transformation of the mind of the student. \"Students had to pass through nine degrees of initiation [William Cooper: the same number that are claimed in the York Rite of Freemasonry]. In the first, the teachers threw their pupils into a state of doubt about all conventional ideas, religious and political. They used false analogy and every other device of argument to make the aspirant believe that what he had been taught by his previous mentors was prejudiced and capable of being challenged. The effect of this according to the Arab historian, Makrizi, was to cause him to lean upon the personality of the teachers, as the only possible source of the proper interpretation of facts. At the same time, the teachers hinted continually that formal knowledge was merely the cloak for hidden, inner and powerful truth, whose secret would be imparted when the youth was ready to receive it. [William Cooper: None ever questioned why no secret was ever put forth.] This 'confusion technique' was carried out until the student reached the stage where he was prepared to swear a vow of blind allegiance to one or other of his teachers. \"This oath, together with certain secret signs, was administered in due course, and the candidate awarded the first degree of initiation. The second degree took the form of initiation into the fact that the Imams ([the] successors of Mohammed) were the true and only sources of secret knowledge and power. Imams inspired the teachers. Therefore the student was to acknowledge every saying and act of his appointed guides as blessed and divinely inspired. In the third degree, the esoteric names of the Seven Imams were revealed, and the secret words by which they could be conjured and by which the powers inherent in the very repetition of their names could be liberated and used for the individual especially in the service of the sect. \"In the fourth degree, the succession of the Seven Mystical Law ‐ givers and magical personalities was given to the learner. These were characterized as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and Ismail. There were seven mystical 'helpers': Seth, Shem, Ishmael, Aaron, Simon, Ali, and Mohammed, the [sons] of Ismail. This last was dead, but he had a mysterious deputy, who was the Lord of the Time: authorized to give his instructions to the People of Truth, as the Ismailis called themselves. This hidden figure gave the Caliph the power to pretend that he was acting under even higher instructions. \"The fifth degree named twelve apostles under the seven prophets, whose names and functions and magical powers were described. In this degree the power to influence others by means of personal concentration was supposed to be taught. One writer claims that this was done merely by the repetition, for a period of three years to train the mind, of the magical word AK ‐ ZABT ‐ I. \"To obtain the sixth degree involved instruction in the methods of analytical and destructive argument, in which the postulant had to pass a [very] stiff examination. The seventh degree brought [revelations] of the Great Secret: that all humanity and all creation were one and every single thing was part of the whole, which included the creative and destructive power [William Cooper: the androgynous god]. But, as an Ismaili, the individual could make use of the power which was ready to be awakened within him, and overcome those who knew nothing of the immense potential of the rest of humanity. This power came through the aid of the mysterious power called the Lord of the Time. \"To qualify for the eighth degree, the aspirant had to believe that all religion, philosophy and the like were fraudulent. All that mattered was the individual, who could attain fulfillment only through servitude to the greatest developed power ‐ the Imam. The ninth and last degree brought the revelation of the secret that there was no such thing as belief: all that mattered was action. And the only possessor of the reasons for carrying out any action was the chief of the sect. \"As a secret society, the organization of the Ismailis as outlined above was undoubtedly powerful and seemed likely to produce a large number of devotees who would blindly obey the orders of whomever was in control of the edifice. But, as with [many] other bodies of 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"this kind, there were severe limitations from the point of view of effectiveness. \"Perhaps the phase of revolt or subversion planned by the society did not in the end get under way; perhaps it was not intended to work by any other means than training the individual. Be that as it may, its real success extended abroad only...to Baghdad [in 1058], where a member gained temporary control of Baghdad and coined money in the Egyptian Caliph's name. [Now] this sultan was slain by the Turks, who now entered the picture, and the Cairo headquarters was also threatened . By 1123, the society was closed down by the Vizier Afdal. The rise of Turkish power seemed to have discouraged the expansionist Cairo sect so strongly that they almost faded out, and [very] little is heard of them after that date. \"It was left to Hasan, son of Sabah, the Old Man of the Mountains, to perfect the system of the ailing secret society, and found an organization which [has] endured for nearly another thousand years. \"Who was Hasan? [Well,] he was the son of a Shiah (Ali ‐ worshipper) in Khorasam, a most bigoted man, who claimed that his ancestors were Arabs, from Kufa. [Now] this assumption was probably due to the fact that such a lineage bolstered up claims to religious importance, then as now, among Moslems. [You see,] the people of the neighborhood, many of them also Shiahs, stated very decisively that this Ali was a Persian, and so were his forebears. [So] it is generally thought that this is the truer version. As the Governor of the Province was an orthodox Moslem, Ali spared no efforts to assume the same guise. [Now] this is considered to be completely permissible ‐‐ the Doctrine of Intelligent Dissimulation. As there was some doubt as to his reliability in the religious sense, he retired into a monastic retreat, and sent his son Hasan to an orthodox school. This school was no ordinary one. It was the circle of disciples presided over by the redoubtable Imam Muwafiq, about whom it was said that every individual who enrolled under him eventually rose to great power. \"It was here that Hasan met Omar Khayyám, the tentmaker ‐ poet and astronomer, later to be the poet laureate of Persia. Another of his schoolmates was Nizam ‐ ul ‐ Mulk, who rose from peasanthood to become prime minister. These three made a pact, according to Nizam's autobiography, whereby whichever rose to high office first would help the others.\" [William Cooper]: And that tenet has survived to this day. It is how their own infiltrate all levels of society, military, and government, and then pull their brothers up into positions below them. It is the method of infiltrating and controlling large masses, populations, governments, military organizations, and society as a whole. \"Nizam, the courtier, became Vizier to Alp ‐ Arslan the Turkish sultan of Persia [William Cooper: in a very relatively short time. He helped Omar], in accordance with his vow, and secured him a pension, which gave him a life of ease and indulgence in his beloved Nishapur, where many of his Rubá'iát poems were written. Meanwhile Hasan remained in obscurity, wandering through the Middle East, waiting for his chance to attain the power of which he had dreamed. Arslan the Lion died, and was succeeded by Malik Shah. Suddenly, Hasan presented himself to Nizam, demanding to be given a place at court. Delighted to fulfill his childhood vow, the vizier obtained for him a favored place, and relates what transpired thus in his autobiography: \"'I had him made a minister by my strong and extravagant recommendations. Like his father, however, he proved to be a fraud, hypocrite and a self ‐ seeking villain. He was so clever at dissimulation that he appeared to be pious when he was not, and before long he had somehow completely captured the mind of the Shah.' \"[Now] Malik Shah was young, and Hasan was trained in the Shiah art of winning people over by apparent honesty [William Cooper: which means it has the appearance, or the look, of honesty, but truly is not. Just as the notice of apparent violations sent by the FCC (laughs)]. But Nizam was still the most important man in the realm, with an impressive record of honest dealing and achievements. Hasan decided to eliminate him. \"The king had asked in that year, 1078, for a complete accounting of the revenue and expenditure of the empire, and Nizam told him that this would take over a year. Hasan, on the other hand, claimed that the whole work could be done in forty days, and offered to prove it [William Cooper: and there's that forty days again]. The task was assigned to him. And the accounts were prepared in the specified time. Something went wrong at this point. The balance of historical opinion holds that Nizam struck back at the last moment, saying, 'By Allah, this man will destroy us all unless he is rendered harmless, though I cannot kill my playmate.' [Now] whatever the truth may be, it seems that Nizam managed to have such disparities introduced into the final calligraphic version of the accounts that when Hasan started to read them they appeared so absurd that the Shah, in fury, ordered him to be exiled. As he had claimed to have written the accounts in his own hand, Hasan could not justify their incredible deficiencies [William Cooper: and could not sluff the blame off upon his friend]. \"Hasan had friends in Isfahan, where he immediately fled. There survives a record of what he said there, which sheds interesting light upon what was in his mind. One of these friends, Abu ‐ al ‐ Fazal, notes that Hasan, after reciting the bitter tale of his downfall, shouted these words, in a state of uncontrollable rage: 'If I had two, just two, devotees who would stand by me, then I would cause the downfall 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"of that Turk and that peasant.' \"Fazal concluded that Hasan had taken leave of his senses, and tried to get him out of this ugly mood. Hasan took umbrage, and insisted that he was working on a plan, and that he would have his revenge. He set off for Egypt, there to mature his plans. \"Fazal was himself later to become a devotee of the Assassin chief, and Hasan, two decades later, reminded him of that day in Isfahan: 'Here I am at Alamut, Master of all I survey: and more. The Sultan and the peasant Vizier are dead. Have I not kept my vow? Was I the madman you thought me to be? I found my two devotees, who were necessary to my plans.' \"Hasan himself takes up the story of how his fortunes fared after the flight from Persia. He had been brought up in the secret doctrines of Ismailism [William Cooper: the Arab branch of the Mysteries], and recognized the possibilities of power inherent in such a system. He knew that in Cairo there was a powerful nucleus of the society. And, if we are to believe the words of Fazal, he already had a plan whereby he could turn their followers into disciplined, devoted fanatics, willing to die for a leader. What was this plan? [Well,] he had decided that it was not enough to promise paradise, fulfillment, eternal joy to people. He would actually show it to them; show it in the form of an artificial paradise, where houris played and fountains gushed sweet ‐ scented waters, where every sensual wish was granted amid beautiful flowers and gilded pavilions. And this [dear listeners] is what he eventually did. \"Hasan chose a hidden valley for the site of his paradise, described by Marco Polo, who passed this way in 1271: \"'In a beautiful valley, enclosed between two lofty mountains, he had formed a luxurious garden stored with every delicious fruit and every fragrant shrub that could be procured. Palaces of various sizes and forms were erected in different parts of the grounds, ornamented with works of gold, with paintings and with furniture of rich silks. By means of small conduits contained in these buildings, streams of wine, milk, honey and some of pure water were seen to flow in every direction. The inhabitants of these places were elegant and beautiful damsels, accomplished in the arts of singing, playing upon all sorts of musical instruments, dancing, and especially those of dalliance and amorous allurement. Clothed in rich dresses, they were seen continually sporting and amusing themselves in the garden and pavilions, their female guardians being confined within doors and never allowed to appear. The object which the chief had in view in forming a garden of this fascinating kind was this: that Mahomet having promised to those who should obey his will the enjoyments of Paradise, where every species of sensual gratification should be found, in the society of beautiful nymphs, he was desirous of it being understood by his followers that he also was a prophet and a compeer of Mahomet, and had the power of admitting to Paradise such as he should choose to favor. In order that none without his license should find their way into this delicious valley, he caused a strong and inexpugnable castle to be erected at the opening to it, through which the entry was by a secret passage.\" [William Cooper]: ...and thus the legend of Shambala, or the paradise in the mountains, a valley of lush greenery, unending fruits, fair, beautiful maidens...thus the legend began. \"Hasan began to attract young men from the surrounding countryside, between the ages of twelve and twenty: particularly those whom he marked out as possible material for the production of killers. Every day he held court, a reception at which he spoke of the delights of Paradise and at certain times he caused droughts of soporific nature to be administered to ten or a dozen youths, and when half dead with sleep [William Cooper: drugged out of their minds] he had them conveyed to the several palaces and apartments of the garden. Upon awakening from this state of lethargy, their senses were struck by all the delightful objects, and each perceiving himself surrounded by lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the most fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicious viands and exquisite wines, until, intoxicated with excess and enjoyment, amidst actual [real] rivers of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, and felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights. When four or five days had thus been passed, they were thrown once more into a state of somnolency [drugged], and carried out of the garden. Upon being carried to his presence, and questioned by him as to where they had been, their answer was, 'in Paradise, through the favor of your highness'; and then, before the whole court who listened to them with eager astonishment and curiosity, they gave a circumstantial account of the scenes to which they had been witnesses. The chief thereupon addressing them said: 'We have the assurance of our Prophet that he who defends his Lord shall inherit Paradise, and if you show yourselves[, if you show yourselves] to be devoted to the obedience of my orders, that happy lot awaits you.' \"[Now] suicide was at first attempted by some [William Cooper: to be able to return to the Paradise that they had just left, not knowing that it was an illusion]; but the survivors were early told that only death in the obedience of Hasan's orders could give the Key to Paradise. [And] in the eleventh century it was not only credulous Persian peasants who would have believed such things were true. Even among [the] more sophisticated people the reality of the gardens and houris of paradise were completely accepted. True, a good many Sufis preached that the garden was allegorical ‐ but that still left more than a few people who believed that they could trust the evidence of their senses. \"The ancient Art of Imposture , by Abdel ‐ Rahman of Damascus, gives away another trick of Hasan's. [You see,] he had a deep, narrow pit sunk into the floor of his audience ‐ chamber. One of his disciples stood in this, in such a way that his head and neck alone were visible 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"above the floor. [And] around the neck was placed a circular dish in two pieces which fitted together, with a hole in the middle. This gave the impression that there was a severed head on a metal plate standing on the floor. [Now] in order to make the scene more plausible (if that is the word) Hasan had some fresh blood poured around the head, on the plate. \"[Then the] recruits were brought in [William Cooper: the initiates]. 'Tell them,' commanded the chief, 'what thou hast seen.' [Then] the disciple [William Cooper: appearing as a head on the plate]...described the delights of Paradise. 'You have seen the head of a man who died, whom you all knew. I have reanimated him to speak with his own tongue.' [William Cooper: And then, he would really sever, treacherously, the man's head] in real earnest, and stuck for some time somewhere that the faithful would see it. The effect of this conjuring trick plus murder increased the enthusiasm for martyrdom to the required degree [William Cooper: and gave him unbelievable control over his flock]. There are many documented instances of the recklessness of the fidayeen (devotees) of the Ismailis, one witness being a Westerner who was treated a century later to a similar spectacle to that which had appalled the envoy of Malik Shah.\" [William Cooper]: But we've got to take a break first, folks. Don't go away, I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: Theme from The Twilight Zone ) [Continuing reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"Henry, Count of Champagne, reports that he was traveling in 1194 through Ismaili territory. 'The chief sent some persons to salute him and beg that, on his return he would stop at and partake of the hospitality of the castle. The Count accepted the invitation. As he returned, the Dai ‐ el ‐ Kebir ([or] Great Missionary) advanced to meet him, showed him every mark of honor, and let him view his castle and fortresses. Having passed through several, they came at length to one of the towers which rose to an exceeding height. On each tower stood two sentinels clad in white. \"These,\" said the Chief, pointing to them, \"obey me far better than the subjects of your Christians obey their lords;\" and at a given signal two of them flung themselves down, and were dashed to pieces. \"If you wish,\" said he to the astonished Count, \"all my white ones shall do the same.\" The benevolent Count shrank from the proposal, and candidly avowed that no Christian prince could presume to look for such obedience from his subjects. When he was departing, with many valuable presents, the Chief said to him meaningly, \"By means of these trusty servants I get rid of the enemies of our society.\"' \"Further details of the mentality of Hasan are given in what is supposed to be an autobiographical account of his early days, and it probably is in fact such, because the method of his conversion does seem to follow the pattern which has been observed in fanatics, of whatever religious or political persuasion. \"He was, he says, reared in the belief of the divine right of the Imams, by his father. He early met an Ismaili missionary (Emir Dhareb) with whom he argued strenuously against the Emir's particular form of creed. Then, sometime later, he went through a bout of severe illness, in which he feared to die, and began to think that the Ismaili doctrine might really be the road to redemption and Paradise. If he died unconverted, he might be damned. Thus it was that as soon as he recovered he sought out another Ismaili propagandist, Abu Najam, and then others. Eventually he went to Egypt, to study the creed at its headquarters. \"He was received with honor by the Caliph, due to his former position at the Court of Malik Shah. in order to increase their own importance, the high officials of the Court made a good deal of public play of the significance of the new convert; but this fact seemed in the end to help Hasan more than it did them. He entered into political intrigue and was arrested, then confined in a fortress. No sooner had he entered the prison than a minaret collapsed, and in some unexplained way this was interpreted as an omen that Hasan was in reality a divinely protected person. The Caliph, hurriedly making Hasan a number of valuable gifts, had him put aboard a ship sailing for north ‐ west Africa. This gave him the funds which he was to use for setting up his 'paradise' ‐‐ and also, through some quirk of fate, the disciples whom he sought. \"A tremendous storm blew up, terrifying the captain, crew and passengers alike. Prayers were held, and Hasan was asked to join. He refused. 'The storm is my doing; how can I pray that it abate?' he asked. [William Cooper: And then says this:] 'I have indicated the displeasure of the Almighty. If we sink, I shall not die, for I am immortal. If you want to be saved, believe in me, and I shall subdue the winds.' \"[Well] at first the offer was not accepted. Presently, however, when the ship seemed on the point of capsizing, the desperate passengers came to him and swore eternal allegiance. Hasan was still [very] calm; and continued so until the storm abated. The ship was then driven on to the sea ‐ coast of Syria, where Hasan disembarked, together with two of the merchant passengers, who became his first 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"real disciples. \"Hasan was not yet ready for the fulfillment of his destiny as he saw it. For the time being, he was traveling under the guise of a missionary of the Caliph in Cairo. From Aleppo he went to Baghdad, seeking a headquarters where he should be safe from interference and where he yet could become powerful enough to expand. Into Persia the road led him, traveling through the country, making converts to his ideas, which were still apparently strongly based upon the secret doctrines of the Egyptian Ismailis. Everywhere he created a really devoted disciple ([or] fidayi) he bade him stay and try to enlarge the circle of his followers. These circles became hatching ‐ grounds for the production of 'self ‐ sacrificers', the initiates who were drawn from the ranks of the most promising ordinary converts. Thus it was that miniature training centers, modeled upon the Abode of Learning, were in being within a very few months of his return to his homeland. \"During his travels, a trusted lieutenant ‐‐ one Hussein Kahini ‐‐ reported that the Iraki district where the fortress of Alamut was situated seemed to be an ideal place for proselytism. Most of the ordinary people of that place, in fact, had been persuaded into the Ismaili way of thinking. The only obstacle was the Governor, Ali Mahdi, who looked upon the Caliph of Baghdad as his spiritual and temporal lord. The first converts were expelled from the country. Before many months, however, there were so many Ismailis among the populace that the Governor was compelled to allow them to return. Hasan, though, he would not brook [William Cooper: would not allow him]. The prospective owner of Alamut decided to try a trick. He offered the Governor three thousand pieces of gold for 'the amount of land which could be encompassed by the hide of an ox'. When Mahdi agreed to such a sale, Hasan produced a skin, cut it into the thinnest possible thongs, and joined them together to form a string which encompassed the castle of Alamut. Although the Governor refused to honor any such bargain, Hasan produced an order from a very highly placed official of the Seljuk rulers, ordering that the fortress be handed over to Hasan for three thousand gold pieces. [Well] it turned out that this official was himself a secret follower of the Sheikh of the Mountain. \"The year was A.D. 1090. Hasan was now ready for the next part of his plan. He attacked and routed the troops of the Emir who had been placed in the governorship of the Province, and welded the people of the surrounding districts into a firm band of diligent and trustworthy workers and soldiers, answerable to him [and him] alone. Within two years the Vizier Nizam ‐ ul ‐ Mulk had been stabbed to the heart by an assassin sent by Hasan, and the Emperor Malik Shah, who dared to send troops against him, died in grave suspicion of poison. Hasan's revenge upon his class ‐ fellow was to make him the very first target of his reign of terror. [You see,] with the king's death, the whole realm was split up into warring factions. For long the Assassins alone retained their cohesion. In under a decade they had made themselves masters of all Persian Irak, and of many forts throughout the empire. This they did by forays, direct attack, the poisoned dagger, and in any other manner which seemed expedient [William Cooper: indeed, the ends always justifies by the means]. The orthodox religious leaders pronounced one interdict after another against their doctrines; all to no effect. \"By now the entire loyalty of the Ismailis under him had been transferred from the Caliph to the personality of the Sheikh of the Mountain, who became the terror of every prince in that part of Asia, the Crusader chiefs included. 'Despite and despising fatigues, dangers and tortures, the Assassins joyfully gave their lives whenever it pleased the great master, who required them either to protect himself or to carry out his mandates of death. The victim having been pointed out, the faithful, clothed in a white tunic with a red sash, the colors of innocence and blood, went on their mission without being deterred by distance or danger. Having found the person they sought, they awaited the favorable moment for slaying him, and their daggers seldom missed their aim.' \"Richard the Lionheart was at one time accused of having asked the 'Lord of the Mountain' to have Conrad of Montferrat killed; a plot which was carried out thus: 'Two assassins allowed themselves to be baptized and placing themselves beside him, seemed intent only on praying. But the favorable opportunity presented itself; they stabbed him and one took refuge in the church. But hearing that the prince had been carried off still alive, he again forced himself into Montferrat's presence, and stabbed him a second time; and then expired, without a complaint, amidst refined tortures.'\" [William Cooper]: Do you see? The method of controlling men's minds that Hasan had perfected was extremely effective and powerful. And not one, not even one, incidence of one of his followers failing to carry out his orders exactly can be found. \"The Order of the Assassins had perfected their method of securing the loyalty of human beings to an extent and on a scale which has seldom been paralleled. \"The Assassins carried on the battle on two fronts. [You see,] they fought whichever side in the Crusades served their purposes [William Cooper: They fought with the Knights Templars and fought against the Knights Templars]. At the same time they continued the struggle against the Persians. The son and successor of Nizam ‐ al ‐ Mulk was laid low by an Assassin dagger. The Sultan, who had succeeded his father Malik Shah and gained power over most of his territories was marching against them. One morning, however, he awoke with an Assassin weapon stuck neatly into the ground near his head. Within it was a note, warning him to call off the proposed siege of Alamut. [Well,] he came to terms with the Assassins [after that], powerful ruler though he undoubtedly was. [William Cooper: You see, the assassins eventually] had what amounted to a free hand, in exchange for a pact by which they promised to reduce their military power.\" 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: It was during their pacts, their treaties, their battles with the Knights Templars that many, some say most, some few even say all, of the Knights Templars were initiated into the Mysteries. \"Hasan lived for thirty ‐ four years after his acquisition of Alamut. On only two occasions since then had he even left his room; yet he ruled an invisible empire as great and as fearsome as any man before ‐‐ or since.\" [William Cooper]: ...they say, but his empire may still exist today, changed and melded with other sects of the Mysteries. \"[Hasan] seemed to realize that death was almost upon him, and calmly began to make plans for the perpetual continuance [folks] of the Order of the Assassins.\" [William Cooper]: And we now begin the latter days of the Assassins which we will not finish in this hour but will finish in the next. \"The ruler of one the most terrifying organizations the world has ever known was without a lineal successor. [In fact,] he had had both of his sons killed: one for carrying out an unauthorized murder, [and] the other for drinking wine; certainly a case of 'do as I say, not as I do'. He called his two most trusted lieutenants from the strongholds which they maintained on his behalf: Kia Buzurg ‐ Umid (Kia of Great Promise) and Abu ‐ Ali of Qaswin. Kia was to inherit the spiritual and mystical aspect, while Abu ‐ Ali attended to the military and administrative affairs of the Order. It is said that Hasan bin Sabah died almost immediately afterwards, in 1124, at ninety years of age; having given the world a new word; assassin. 'Assasseen' in Arabic signifies 'guardians', and some commentators have considered this to be the true origin of the word: 'guardians of the secrets [William Cooper: which the Knight Templar took to Europe].' \"The Organization of the Order, under Hasan, called for Missionaries...Friends... who were disciples, and Fidavis, devotees. The last group had been added by Hasan to the Ismaili original, and these were the trained killers. Fidavis wore white, with a girdle, cap or boots of red. In addition to careful coaching in where and when to place the dagger in the victim's bosom, they were trained in such things as languages, the dress and manners of monks, merchants and soldiers, any of whom they were ready to impersonate in carrying out their missions. The chief was known as Sayedna ([which means] Our Prince, [or] Leader), and popularly (because of the mountain stronghold of Alamut), as the Sheikh of the Mountain.\" [William Cooper:] Now, Alamut, or the stronghold of the mountain, was also known as \"The Eagle's Nest,\" and this is what Hitler named his mountain retreat, and there's also an Eagle's Nest near Santa Barbara, California, which very few people know anything about...yet. \"[Now, the Sheikh of the Mountain] is the figure referred to in Crusaders' writings as 'Sydney', or 'Senex de Monte', the first word being a literal translation of the word 'Pir': Persian for Ancient, or Sage. There were three Great Missionaries, who ruled three territories. After the Friends and Fidavis came the Laziks, aspirants who were being trained for membership of the society, but were as yet uninitiated. \"Hasan reduced the original number of degrees of initiation from nine to the mystical number of seven. A similar number of regulations formed the rules of the Order. This, in fact, comprised the working plan of the spreading of the Faith. The First Rule was that the Missionary must know human psychology in such a way as to be able to select suitable people for admission to the cult; and was summed up in the mnemonic: 'Cast no seeds upon rocks.' The second rule of procedure was the application of flattery and gaining the confidence of the prospective member. Third came the casting of doubt into the mind, by superior knowledge. Fourthly, the teacher must apply an oath to [the] student never to betray any of the 'truths' which were to be revealed to him. Now he was told, as the fifth stage, that Ismailism was a powerful secret organization, supported by some of the most important figures of the time. After this, the aspirant was questioned and studied, to discover whether he had absorbed the opinions of the teacher and attached himself sufficiently into a position of dependence upon his ideas. [And] at this stage he was asked to meditate upon the meaning of the reported saying of the prophet that 'Paradise lies in the shadow of swords.' In the final degree, many difficult passages of the Koran were explained in terms of allegory. \"How is it that the rules of this extraordinarily successful Order are known in such detail? [Well,] it so happened that when the Mongols eventually overthrew Alamut by force of arms, their chief Halaku ([meaning] 'Destruction') Khan, asked his chief minister to examine their library. This most learned man, 'Father of Kings' Jawani, later wrote a careful book in which he detailed the organization of the Assassins, whose name he attributed to the use of the drug Hashish, which they were said to use in stupefying candidates for the ephemeral visit to 'paradise'. \"It is possible that recruits were made in another way than by selecting gullible, fully grown youths. Legend has it that Hasan, once master of Alamut, used to buy unwanted children from their parents, and train them in implicit obedience and with the sole desire to die in his service. \"Buzurg ‐ Umid ([meaning] 'Great Promise'), the second Grand Master [William Cooper: 'Grand Master' is still used today, folks], 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"maintained the power of the Assassins on much the same pattern: building new forts, gaining fresh converts, terrorizing those whom he did not want to have killed and using them to further his design of world conquest. Sultan Sanjar of Persia, in spite of several expeditions against the Viper's Nest, as Alamut was now being called, could do little about him.\" [William Cooper:] \"Viper's Nest\" was the term given by the Assassins' enemies. The Assassins themselves call it the \"Eagle's Nest.\" \"Ambassadors on each side were slain; a notable religious leader was captured by the Assassins, given a mock trial and flung into a furnace. The Grand Master at this time seldom put on the field more than two thousand men at a time: but it must be remembered that they were killers acting under an iron discipline, and more than a match for any organized army that they might ever have to face. Now the Order began to spread in Syria, where the continued contact with the Crusaders was established. \"The warriors of the Cross were in fairly effective control of an area extending from the Egyptian border to Armenia in the north. Bahram, a Persian leader of the Assassin cult from Astrabad, gained control of a mighty fortress in Syria, in the region known as the Valley of Demons (Wadi ‐ el ‐ Jan), and from there spread [out] from one fort to another. The Grand Prior Bahram now moved to an even more substantial fortified place, Massyat. Bahram's successor, Ismail the Lash ‐ Bearer, planted a trained devotee on the saintly Vizier of Baghdad, into whose confidence he worked his way to such an extent that this Assassin, now called the 'Father of Trust', was actually made Grand Judge of Baghdad. \"The Crusaders had by now been about thirty years in the Holy Land, and the Assassins decided that they could usefully form an alliance with them aimed against Baghdad. A secret treaty was therefore made between the Grand Master and Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, whereby the Ismaili Grand Judge would have opened the gates of Baghdad treacherously to the Crusaders, if the fortified city of Tyre were handed over to the Assassins for their part in the transaction. \"[William Cooper: Well, (laughs) as with most plans,] something went wrong. The judge had ordered an underling to open the city's gates. This servant had told the military commander of Damascus, who lost no time in killing the man, the Vizier and six thousand people believed to be secret Assassins within the city. The Damascus garrison fell upon the Crusaders and beat them back in a thunderstorm which the Christian warriors attributed to divine anger at their unworthy pact, and the Assassins as an attempt by the powers of Nature to allow the Crusaders into the city under its cover. \"Meanwhile the Grand Master was indulging in an orgy of destruction of individual rulers who opposed his creed; the list is interminable, but this is a fair example: 'The celebrated Aksunkur, Prince of Mosul, was a warrior equally dreaded by the Christians and the Assassins. As this Prince, on his return from Ma'ara Masrin, where the Moslem and Christian hosts had parted without venturing to engage, entered the Mosque at Mosul to perform his devotions, he was attacked at the moment when he was about to take his usual seat by [William Cooper: not one, but] eight Assassins, disguised as dervishes. Three of them fell below the blows of the valiant Emir; but ere his people could come to his aid, he had received his death ‐ wound and expired.' \"The fanaticism which inspired the killers was shared, it seems, by other members of their families, who had been thoroughly trained in the bloody creed: for the historian Kamal ‐ ed ‐ Din relates, 'On this occasion when the mother of one of the youths who attempted Aksunkur's life heard that he had been slain, she painted her face and donned the gayest raiment and ornaments, rejoicing that her son had been found worthy to die the glorious death of a martyr in the cause of the Imam. But when she saw him return alive and unscathed, she cut off her hair and blackened her countenance, and would not be comforted.' \"Things thus continued for the fourteen years and a quarter of the Second Grand Master's rule. When he died he nominated his son Kia Mohammed as his successor. Under Mohammed the killings continued, a part of the sea ‐ coast of Palestine came into Assassin hands, and the cult leaders reaffirmed their overt belief in orthodox Islam. In public, Ismailis were ordinary Moslems; the secret doctrine of the divinely guided leader was not to be discussed with the uninitiated.\" [William Cooper]: Don't miss tomorrow night's show. Good night, and God bless each and every one of you.

I'm your host, William Cooper. (opening music: Long As I Can See The Light , by Creedence Clearwater Revival) Tonight folks, I come to you with a heavy heart. For another one, actually two, of my predictions...one has come true, one is about to come true. The one that has come true involve the loss of life and the injury of over five hundred people. And of course, I'm talking about the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City. As far back as 1989, and ever since, I've been predicting major terrorist attacks upon the United States. The primary number one target: New York City. I have said it so many times, and so many people attending my lectures, listening to my broadcasts, and who have read my book, are familiar with it. I never, never enjoy being right when it involves the loss of life and human injury. Nevertheless, it is another chalk mark on the board, and I remain the most accurate predictor of future world events in the history of the world. But the one that is about to come true, and has not yet, is the prediction that I made that the United States would send troops to Yugoslavia, and it appears that that is going to happen in the very near future. Anyway, we will see, won't we, as we move into the New World Order, and all of these events are planned to take us directly into one ‐ world totalitarian socialist government. To all those people in New York who lost relatives, or who had friends or relatives that were injured, I offer you my deepest compassion, sympathy, and I wish that I could tell you that that was the end of it, but I can tell you that it is only the beginning. Unless people wake up, it will escalate and there will be more. Don't forget, folks, Monday, March 15th, 8pm, LaFayette Hotel, 2223 El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego. I'll be there, I'll be giving a three ‐ hour presentation, entitled The Sacrificed King: On the Assassination of John F. Kennedy . In it, I will directly connect to the occult worship of Mystery Babylon, the secret societies, and specifically to the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which really is just the outward form of the old Knights Templar. And I also believe, have reason to believe, that the sovereign and military order of the Knights of Malta was involved, which is just another branch of the old Templar order.

Well, let's continue where we left off and, uh, this is about the society in the Middle East known as the Assassins, and we've covered 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"quite a bit of their history already: [Reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"But this secret society, [the] most successful of secret societies showed that its strength ultimately depended upon a powerful leader. [Well,] Kia Mohammed was no such leader, and little by little it became obvious that his son, Hasan the Hated, was the stronger personality.\" [William Cooper]: Now remember, Kia Mohammed was the Old Man of the Mountain, and the mountain lair was called, \"The Eagle's Nest.\" \"Now Hasan, through some magnetic power, was able to capture the imagination of the Assassins, soon having it believed that he himself was none other than the Power of All Powers, the Hidden Imam, who had been mentioned by the first Grand Master; an incarnation of all greatness. So important was [Hasan] that he was the fountain of power, and others only held a [very small] measure of authority because he allowed them to have it [William Cooper: for no other reason]. \"This final absurdity was lapped up by members who had been conditioned to believe in things which were not, shall we say, exactly self ‐ evident to the ordinary man. The doctrine of the all ‐ powerful Invisible Imam was a part of Ismailism; and Hasan was ready even during his early manhood to assume the role. But, since his father was able to assert himself by having some two hundred and fifty of Hasan' followers murdered, he thought it wiser to hold his hand. In 1163 his chance came. Mohammed died, and Hasan II issued an order to all Ismailis to collect below the castle of Alamut. \"Never before had such an assembly of killers, fanatics and dedicated perverters of the truth been seen. Hasan, probably in a state of megalomania, assured them that he had received a message from the Almighty that as from now, all the bond of religion were loosed: everyone might do as he liked.\" [William Cooper]: Later, in the modern age, we would hear that again as, \"The whole of the Law shall be: do as thou wilt.\" \"It was not necessary [he said] to keep up pretences. And, furthermore, he, Hasan, was none other than the Hidden Imam. His word was law; and he was a form of the divinity, not merely relaying instructions from above [William Cooper: but the divinity]. \"There was one further obstacle [folks]. According to Ismaili doctrine, the Hidden Imam was to be of the Family of Hashim, the blood of Mohammed the Prophet. Such descendants were known and revered: and it was common knowledge that Hasan II was not one of them. He overcame this difficulty by stating that he was not in fact the true son of Kia Mohammed the Persian, but an adopted child of the Caliphial family of Egypt. This pretence was carried on for four years, during which the crazed Hasan showed that he was not as mad as he might have been, by consolidating quite efficiently the power of the cult. Eventually, he was assassinated by his brother ‐ in ‐ law, Namwar ('The Famous'). Now the father ‐ to ‐ son succession seemed to be established. Mohammed II, son of Hasan II, began the cultivation of letters and sciences which was to distinguish successive Grand Masters of the Order. It was a conceit of his, in the time of the greatest flowering of Persian literature, that he was supreme among poets and philosophers. He used his assassins [also] to drive this point well home. The Imam Razi, one of the greatest thinkers of the time, refused to acknowledge the Assassins as the most advanced theologians: so Mohammed II sent an envoy to him, promising either a swift death by dagger or a pension of several thousand gold pieces a year. Suddenly [William Cooper: Oh yes, suddenly!] the learned Imam's discourses seemed to lose their bite. One day, soon afterwards, he was asked why he did not attack the Assassins as of old. 'Because,' said the old man, with a nervous glance around the assembly where a murderer might lurk, 'their arguments are so sharp, and pointed [William Cooper: and indeed, they were].' \"For thirty ‐ five years Mohammed II ruled the Ismailis with a rod of iron; the only law was that of obedience to the Assassin will. The observances of ritual Islam were abolished. A new star had arisen [William Cooper: Remember that star?]: a power to stiffen resistance to Crusader penetration; Saladin, who was to become an implacable foe of the Assassins. \"The Syrian branch of the cult grew in power, while the activities of the Eastern Assassins were carried out much more quietly, with missionaries being sent to India, Afghanistan, even the remote Pamir mountains which straddle China and Russia, where even today adherents of the sect are to be found. Saladin had overcome the other Ismaili branch and original home of Assassinism ‐ Egypt ‐ and restored the true faith to the people of the Nile. He now had enough booty for ten years' war against the Crusaders in Palestine, and troops to spare. His first task was to unify the forces of Islam; and this he determined to do by force, if necessary. Sinan, Ancient of the Assassin cult in Syria, decided to oppose this terrible enemy of the Fatimites. Three assassins fell upon Saladin and nearly killed him. This made the sect a priority target for the Saracen chief. The Old Man of the Mountain, for his part [William Cooper: Who was now Mohammed II], now unleashed a succession of fanatics, in every kind of disguise, upon Saladin. By 1176, Saladin decided that an end 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"must be put to the cult. He invaded their territory and started to lay it waste, when the Assassin chief offered him freedom of action to fight the Crusaders, and no, no further attempt upon his life, if the cult were spared. These terms were agreed to, and henceforth no Assassin ever again attempted to molest Sultan Saladin. \"This period introduces Sinan as yet another strange and terrible Assassin leader. [For] he had decided that he was the incarnation of all power and deity, and that he would live the part. Sinan was never seen to eat or drink, sleep, or even to spit.\" [William Cooper]: Now can you imagine this? A living, human being never seen to eat or drink, sleep, or even to spit. \"Between sunrise and sunset he stood on a pinnacle of rock, dressed in a hair ‐ shirt, and preached his own power and glory to delighted Assassins.\" [William Cooper]: Have you ever worn a hair shirt? Have you ever stood on a pinnacle of rock between sunrise and sunset? I mean, every sunrise and sunset, and wearing a hair shirt every sunrise and sunset? Well, folks, this is historic fact. This is not something that someone made up. \"Thus, at one and the same time, there were two chiefs of the Order, each busily telling his own followers that he, and he alone, was God [was God!]. Hasan in Persia, Sinan in Syria, each commanded legions of devoted killers, all committed by oath to follow his path. \"When Mohammed II died, he was succeeded by his son Jalaludin, who completely reversed the orders that the Assassins were to have no outward religious observances. [You see] he felt that he could do a great deal by adopting the cloak of orthodox piety, and sent ambassadors far and wide to announce his maintenance of the true faith. He went so far as to curse his predecessors publicly, in order to convince the incredulous that such a people as the Assassins could turn over a new leaf. As a result of what would today be called a long ‐ term and comprehensive propaganda plan, he was acknowledged as a religious leader by half the orthodox monarchs of Islam, and (the first Assassin to be so styled) came to be termed Prince Jalaludin. \"Jalaludin died in 1203, after twelve years of leadership of the cult, handing over to Alaeddin ([or] Aladdin [William Cooper: And you guys thought that it was just a storybook tale, didn't you? Aladdin), a child of nine years of age. Weak, inefficient, stupid, Alaeddin made little mark upon history.\" [William Cooper]: Except in the classic tales of Arabia, the 1001 Arabbian Nights , for Aladdin in the 1001 Arabbian Nights is Aladdin, the leader of the Assassins. \"It is said that his main activity was tending sheep, to which he was passionately attached, and he even had a small hut built in a sheepfold, where he spent most of his time. [Aladdin] was extraordinarily cruel, in spite of the contact with the sheep, and continued to terrorize in time ‐ honored fashion any person, great or small, who did not pay tribute or otherwise co ‐ operate with the organization. [William Cooper]: And even today, those in power who are in contact with sheep most of the time (laughs) ultimately turn out to be same. And we all know who the sheeple are, don't we? \"The Assassins' hands, ears and eyes were everywhere. Once fully initiated, a man might be sent to a place a thousand miles away...to take up residence and live: waiting for the moment when orders came to him from Alamut to fulfill his fatal destiny [William Cooper: and all the while in ‐ between, furnishing intelligence to the central headquarters of the Assassins]. A story is told of the court of the Shah of Khwarism, thus: 'The Ismaili ambassador spent some time with the Vizier. One day, after a splendid banquet when the wine which they had been drinking in violation of the law had mounted into their heads, the ambassador told the Vizier by way of confidence that there were several Ismailis among the pages, grooms, guards and other persons who were immediately about the Sultan. The Vizier, dismayed and at the same time curious to know who these dangerous attendants were, besought the ambassador to point them out to him, giving him his napkin as a pledge that nothing evil should happen to them. Instantly, at a sign from the envoy, five of the persons who were attendants in the chamber stepped forth, avowing themselves to be concealed Assassins, \"On such a day and at such an hour,\" said one of them, an Indian, to the Vizier, \"I might have slain thee without being seen or punished; and if I did not do so it was only because I had no orders from my superiors.\"' \"The Vizier [of course] begged for his life. But word got the Sultan, who ordered the Assassins to be apprehended and burned alive, and 'the five chamberlains were cast on the flaming pyre, where they died exulting at being found worthy to suffer in the service of the great Sheikh of the Mountain [William Cooper: so powerful was their devotion to the cult].' The Assassins had the last laugh, for an order arrived immediately afterwards from Alamut, that the Shah must pay ten thousand pieces of gold as compensation for each man killed ‐ which he did [William Cooper: or be killed himself]. \"Another subsidiary activity which the Assassins delighted in was holding captive in Alamut of useful, rare and distinguished personages 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"who could be of value to them in educational, military or other spheres. One was a physician, another a famous astronomer, a third the greatest painter in Persia, who worked to the order of the chief alone. \"The end of a chapter was near, for the Mongol hordes under Halaku, lieutenant of Chinghiz, were steadily destroying all the civilization of Islam which lay in their inexorable path westwards. Rukneddin, son of Alaeddin, succeeded him and tried at first to turn the Mongol tide. After a series of encounters, pitched battles, intrigues and counter ‐ intrigues, Rukneddin was taken. He played for time as long as he could, but was eventually murdered in his own turn by the victorious Mongol chief's men. Assassin power in Persia was broken, and what remained of the members were ordered ‐ none knows by whom ‐ to conceal their faith and await a signal that the cult was in full operation again. Alamut was silenced, and the Syrian headquarters alone remained.\" [William Cooper]: And if it had not been for the refusal of the Christian kings in Europe to send ambassadors to make a treaty, or a new Crusade, with the Mongol horde, then all of Islam would have been decimated. But it was not, for the Christian kings, even though they would have liked to regain their foothold in the Middle East, had problems of their own and ignored the Mongol emissaries. \"It was a long time until the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt was able to overcome the Mongol thrust. In 1260, however, he carried the banners of Islam victoriously against them, and restored the fortress of Alamut and other properties to the Assassins, who were strongly surviving underground. They soon found that they had exchanged one master for another, for the Egyptians were now employing them for their own purposes [William Cooper: and required them to undergo a new initiation, that of the ancient Egyptian Mysteries of Babylon]. Ibn Batuta, the great traveler of the fourteenth century, found them well entrenched in their former strong places, being used as the 'arrows of the Sultan of Egypt with which he reaches his enemies.' \"The supposed suppression of the creed which followed the Mongol destruction did not in fact take place. Copying each other, historians (laughs) have asserted that Assassinism died six hundred years ago [William Cooper: nothing could be further from the truth]. Now and again, however, fresh facts of their continued existence still come to light. In the eighteenth century an Englishman, the British Consul at Aleppo in Syria, was at pains to make this better known: 'Some authors assert,' he writes, 'that these people were entirely extirpated in the thirteenth century by the Tartars... but I, who have lived so long in this infernal place, will venture to affirm that some of their spawn still exists in the mountains that surround us; for nothing is so cruel, barbarous and execrable that is not acted, and even gloried in, by these cursed [Assassins].' \"The Assassins were widely dispersed throughout Asia. The rise of the Thugs, the secret society of assassination of India, followed the Mongol invasion of Persia. indeed, at least one of the Thug recognition ‐ signals (Ali bhai Salam!) indicates salutations to Ali, the descendant of the Prophet most greatly revered by the Assassins. Ismailis, not all of them recognizing the one chief, reside in places as far apart as Malaya, East Africa and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). They would not necessarily feel that they are Assassins in the same sense as the extremists who followed the old Sheikhs of the Mountains; but at least some of them revere the descendants of the Lords of Alamut to the extent of deification. \"The modern phase of Ismailism dates from 1810, when the French consul at Aleppo found that the Assassins in Persia recognized as their divinely ‐ inspired chief a reputed descendant of the Fourth Grand Master of Alamut, who then lived at Kehk, a small village between Isfahan and Tehran. This Shah Khalilullah 'was revered almost like a god and credited with the power of working miracles... the followers of Khalilullah would, when he pared his nails, fight for the clippings; the water in which he washed became holy water.' \"The sect next appear to the public gaze through an odd happening. In 1866, a law case was decided in Bombay. There is in that city a large community of commercial men known as Khojas: 'A Persian,' the record tells us, 'Aga Khan Mehalati (i.e., a native of Mehelat, a place situated near Khek) had sent an agent to Bombay to claim from the Khojas the annual tribute due from them to him, and amounting to about £ 10,000. The claim was resisted, and the British court was appealed to by Aga Khan. Sir Joseph Arnold investigated his claim. The Aga proves his pedigree, showing that he descended in a direct line from the fourth Grand Master of Alamut, and Sir Joseph declared it proved; and it was further demonstrated by the trial that the Khojas were members of the ancient sect of the Assassins, to which sect they had been converted four hundred years before by an Ishmaelite missionary, who composed a work which has remained the sacred book of the Khojas.' \"In the First Afghan War, the then Aga Khan contributed a force of light cavalry to the British forces. For this he was awarded a pension. Hitti, in his History of the Arabs, notes (p. 448, 1951 edition) that the Assassin sect, known as Khojas and Malwas, gave over a tenth of their revenues to the Aga Khan, who 'spends most of his time as a sportsman between Paris and London.' \"The influence of the new form of organization and training, as well as initiatory techniques, of the Assassins upon later societies has been remarked by a number of students [William Cooper: and I have found in my research that it's absolutely true]. That the Crusaders knew a good deal about the Ismailis is shown from the detailed descriptions of them which survive. S. Ameer Ali, an Orientalist of considerable repute, goes further in his assessment: 'From the Ismailis the Crusaders borrowed the conception which led to the formation of all the secret societies, religious and secular, of Europe. The institutions of Templars and Hospitallers; the Society of Jesus, 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"founded by Ignatius Loyola, composed by a body of men whose devotion to their cause can hardly be surpassed in our time; the ferocious Dominicans, the milder Franciscans ‐ may all be traced either to Cairo or to Alamut. The Knights Templar especially, with their system of grand masters, grand priors and religious devotees, and their degrees of initiation, bear the strongest analogy to the Eastern Ismailis.'\" [William Cooper]: We've got to take a break, folks. I'll be right back, right after those short pause. (break music: Moonglow , words by Eddie De Lange, music by Will Hudson and Irving Mills, made famous by Benny Goodman) [William Cooper]: In the year 1110, a mysterious order called the Prieuré de Sion appeared upon the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This mysterious secret order, the Prieuré de Sion, was eventually to crown the first king, the first Christian king of Jerusalem. When they appeared in the Temple Mount in 1110, they recruited nine knights to comb, to scour the Temple Mount, the passages and caverns and tunnels beneath for the ancient remains of the relics of their religion. [continuing reading from A History of Secret Societies , by Arkon Daraul, starting on page 39]: \"Later in A.D. 1118, nine knights, [supposedly] concerned for the welfare of pilgrims to the Holy Land, bound themselves together in the creation of a knightly Order.\" [William Cooper]: This order, again existing of nine knights, just like the original nine knights, were commissioned by the Prieuré de Sion. \"In under two hundred years [folks] this organization had become one of the most powerful single entities ‐ if not the greatest ‐ [William Cooper: power ever to exist] in Europe.\" [William Cooper]: They were the first international bankers. The first that ever existed in the world. \"A few years later it was utterly destroyed.\" [William Cooper]: They say, however, as you're going to find out, they were not destroyed at all, but merely driven underground. \"The zeal of religion, the conditioning which made men support a dedicated cause with all of their might, was likewise the instrument of their destruction. Nothing less than religious fervor could have smashed the Order: as nothing less could have created it.\" [William Cooper]: And folks, you're going to find it difficult to believe, but the rise of this order and destruction, at least publically, of this order has such a great bearing on events today that you could say that everything that has happened since has been brought about by this one series of acts. \"Were the Knights Templar devil ‐ worshippers, secret Saracens indulging in obscene orgies? Did they adore a head, spit on the Cross, use the word, 'Yallah' [William Cooper: which means literally in Arabic, 'Oh, Allah,'] in their rituals? Did they learn their ways from the terrible sect of the Assassins?\" [William Cooper]: Well, yes folks, they did. And they are the link ‐‐ at least, in that day, would have been considered the modern link ‐‐ between the ancient Mystery Religion of Babylon and Europe. For the religion had come to Europe long, long before the Templars ever emerged, and made their appearance in the ancient worship of the sun by the druids and the Celts, and the tribes, the Germanic tribes who had made their way thousands of years ago from the Middle East up through Asia, and across Russia and into Europe. They brought Mystery Babylon with them, and practiced it as what we now know of today is the pagan religion. And Stonehenge is actually an ancient Babylonian temple of the sun. And you will find how all this connects later. [William Cooper]: But the origin of this was lost, and the ability to control large numbers of people, by the use of the hidden knowledge of the ages, was lost. It wasn't until the Knights Templar [bought] and brought the Mystery Religion of Babylon to Europe, that the ancient, ancient worship of the sun again took hold. Amongst the Christian countries, in the guise of Christianity, which was itself at that time ‐‐ I'm not talking about the teachings of Christ now, I'm talking about the perversion of the teachings of Christ ‐‐ the melding of the teachings of Christ with the ancient worship of the sun, the Mystery Religion of Babylon which became the Catholic church was indeed another branch of the ancient Mystery Religion of Babylon. And some of you out there may be confused from all of this. 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: If you've been listening from the beginning of this series, then you're right on target; you're not confused, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

The Sweet Mother of God [William Cooper: at least outwardly they say] was chosen as their patroness; and they bound themselves to live in accordance with the rules of St. Augustine, electing as the their first leader Hugh de Payens. King Baldwin II granted him a part of his palace to live in and gave them a grant toward its upkeep.\" [William Cooper]: Now the part of the palace they lived in was an ancient mosque, which was built upon the actual location of the old Temple of Solomon, on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. \"[The Knights Templar] vowed to consecrate their swords, arms, strength and lives to the defense of the mysteries of the Christian faith; to pay complete and utter obedience to the orders of the Grand Master; to fight whenever commanded, regardless of perils, for the faith of Christ as they understood it. Among the vows taken which were forbade their yielding even a foot of land to the enemy [whoever the enemy was] and not to retreat, even if attacked in the proportion of three to one. They choose the name militia templi ‐ Soldiers of the Temple ‐ after the temple supposedly built by Solomon in Jerusalem, near which they had been assigned quarters by the King.\" [William Cooper]: ...but in reality had nothing to do with the Temple of Solomon. \"Some say that the Templars derived their idea of their Order from that of the Hospitallars, who looked after Catholic pilgrims to Palestine; for there was little hospitality to be had from the native Orthodox Christians of those parts. Others hold that there was an even older Order from which they received their inspiration. No reliable evidence is, at this point however, available...\" [William Cooper]: ...according to the \"establishment\" historians, although for those who really, really research the true history of the secret orders, and specifically the Knights Templars, there's a direct connection to the Assassins and the Roshaniya. \"Although the Templars were so poor than two men had to share a horse [William Cooper: they say, but that is not true at all] (and their Seal commemorated this decades after they became one of the richest communities of their time), they soon attracted favorable notice and support.\" [William Cooper]: Now, the two knights riding a horse was a symbol of sacrifice. It denoted their vows of poverty. In truth, each knight now only had a horse, but he had what they called a yeoman. He had a spare horse, he had a pack horse, and he had several horses in reserve, and a whole train of servants. But the Knights Templar were the first true ‐ as we know it in modern times, in modern times there were others before, but they were the first true in modern times ‐ and by modern, I'd say, from the time that Europe escaped from the tribe of paganism. In other words, I consider 1110...I consider that to be beginning of the modern age. Although historians may disagree with me, it's the beginning of everything that has happened since, and everything that's happening today can be traced right to the door of the Knights Templar, and that's why I say that. They were the first modern order to practice what we now know as true Communism. They were the ones who brought international Socialism into Europe, which has always been the tenet and the creed of the Mystery Religion of Babylon. \"Only after one year of their establishment, Fulk, Count of Anjou, who had come to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, joined as a married member and gave them an annual grant of thirty pounds of silver. This example was soon followed by other devout Western princes. \"For the first nine years of their existence, the knights continued to live a life of chastity and poverty in accordance with their vows. They adopted a striped black and white banner, called the Beauseant , after their original piebald horse; and this word also became their battle ‐ cry. Special raiment they had none, and they wore whatever clothes were given to them by the pious. But little by little, as one writer puts it, they were to become 'haughty and insolent.'\" [William Cooper]: And the black and white banner, the translation of the meaning of which was for the, again, exoteric, for the real meaning of the black and white banner was the meaning of the androgynous god, the positive and the negative, the black and the white, the yin and the yang, the male and the female combined into one, and that was the real meaning of the black and white banner. And it's carried forth today on the floor of many of the temples of Freemasonry where the black and white checkered pattern exists, and in one famous cathedral in Europe built by the Knights Templar. They disguised their esoteric religion in an exoteric manner that would 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"be accepted by Christianity. \"Baldwin of Jerusalem, who had been a prisoner in the hands of the Saracens and knew of their disunity, realized at about this time that Islam must eventually unite against the Christian invasion, and the decided that the Templars who prove ideal allies in the battles which were to come. In 1127, therefore, he sent two Templars with his strong recommendation to the Pope, applying for official recognition of the Order by the Holy See.\" [William Cooper]: And this is the first time that the Templars even were considered to be close to the center of religion, the Christian religion in that day, the Catholic church, the Pope. For they were not commissioned as a Christian order; they were not commissioned by the Pope or by the church, and this is a big myth that the Knights Templar started out to protect the church and to protect the pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. They were established first, primarily, and foremost as a branch of the ancient order of the Religion of Mystery Babylon. And it's indicative of the strategies that they've used since to endear themselves to whatever the established power, or the beliefs of the majority of the people might be. \"[When they went to see the Pope, they had an] introduction to St. Bernard himself, the Abbot of Clairvaux, who was known to be admirer of theirs, and who was a nephew of one of their envoys. Then the Grand Master himself arrived in Europe, and received the eulogistic opinion of the Abbot: 'They go not headlong into battle, but with care and foresight, peacefully, as true children of Israel. But as soon as the fight had begun, they rush without delay upon the foe...and know no fear...one has often put to flight a thousand; two, ten thousand...gentler than lambs and grimmer than lions; theirs is the mildness of monks and the valor of the knight.'\" [William Cooper]: Now folks, this was a strong recommendation, and this testimonial was part of the campaign of the Templars in their efforts at recognition of the Pope. All of you who have thought that they began as a religious order in the first place are so way off base that's it's pathetic. And neither were the Jesuits a religious order in the first place, but we'll get that together in another broadcast. \"[But on] the 31st [of] January [in the year] 1128, the Master appeared before the Council of Troyes. This formidable body consisted of the Archbishops of Rheims and Sens, ten bishops and a number of abbots ‐ including St. Bernard himself ‐ presided over by the Cardinal of Albano, the Papal legate. They were approved; and Pope Honorius chose for them a white mantle, completely plain. The red cross was added by order of Pope Eugenius III in 1146.\" [William Cooper]: And see, you thought the Templars thought of this...nope, not at all. This was mandated by two Popes: first, the white mantle, completely plain; and then later the red cross was added by Pope Eugenius III in 1146. \"Hugh de Payens now took his delegation through France and England, and collected a number of recruits. Gifts and grants were showered upon the Order; lands, rents and arms were forthcoming from all quarters. Richard I of England was enthusiastic about them. By 1133, King Alfonso of Aragon and Naverre, who had fought the Spanish Moors in twenty ‐ nine battles, had willed his country to them; although when the Moors finally laid him low his nobles prevented the Templars from claiming their rights.\" [William Cooper]: Nevertheless, this was of great honor. In fact, to my knowledge and the knowledge and research of the history that it never had before been done. \"In 1129 the Master, accompanied by three hundred knights, recruited from the noblest houses of Europe, led a huge train of pilgrims to the Holy Land. It was at this time that the Templars formed part of the Christian contingent which, allied with the Assassins, tried to take Damascus.\" [William Cooper]: And it wasn't the first time nor the last that the Christian Knights Templar, or supposedly Christian Knights Templar (they really weren't Christian at all) were allied with the Assassins. \"Were they (as the Orientalist von Hammer alleges) connected in some secret way with the Assassins? [William Cooper: Yes, our research shows that it is a historical fact. And it is also a historical fact that the Assassins were prepared to adopt Christianity if they could gain greater power thereby (Christianity, that is, on the surface, just as the Knights Templar had done)]. Hammer points to the similarities of the two organizations. the followers of Hasan Ibn Sabah were in contact with the Templars, and had a similar method of organization. They were in existence before the Templars were formed: 'The Ismailians (Assassins) was the original, and the Order of the Templars, the copy.'\" [William Cooper]: And folks, the order of the Templars was the copy. \"The balance of Western opinion is against this contention; more particularly because, one feels from wide reading of historians, great sympathy is felt for the cruelly treated and a arbitrarily dispossessed Templars. Thus Keightley, who made a close study of the Order 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"those who would claim that the Templars were an Assassin branch...\" [William Cooper]: ...but, when you do research into the (laughs) associations and memberships of Keightley, you'll find that Keightley was himself a Knight Templar. And he said: \"'When, nearly thirty years after their institution, the Pope gave them permission to wear a cross on their mantle, like the rival Hospitaller Order, no color could present itself to well suited to those who daily and hourly exposed themselves to martyrdom as that of blood, in which there was so much of what was symbolical. With respect to internal organization it will, we apprehend, be always found that this is for the most part of the growth of time and the product of circumstances; and it always nearly the same where these last are similar.'\" [William Cooper]: And you find this kind of rhetoric, semantics, all throughout the writings of those who wish to cover the true origin and the true meaning of Mystery Babylon. \"The famous question of the three thousand gold pieces paid by the Syrian branch of the Assassins to the Templars is another matter which has never been settled. One Opinion holds that this money was given as a tribute to the Christians; the other, that it was a secret allowance from the larger to the small organization...\" [William Cooper]: ...which it really was, as the Assassins wished to expand their control and remember, their original goal was to take over the entire world by the systematic infiltration and control of each individual country. \"Those who think that the Assassins were fanatical Moslems, and therefore would not form any alliance with those who to them were infidels, should be reminded that to the followers of the Old Man of the Mountains only he was right, and the Saracens who were fighting the Holy War for Allah against the Crusaders were as bad as anyone else who did not accept the Assassin doctrine.\" [William Cooper]: And it is true today: \"If you are not one of us, you are nothing.\" \"The ends justify the means.\" \"The strength of our Order exists in the fact that we manifest ourselves under many different names and many different occupations, and sometimes even seem to oppose ourselves. But at the highest level, we are of one mind.\" And I could go on, and on (laughs), and on, and you all know that I could go on and on and on. For I have studied this for so many years that I eat, drink and sleep it. Oh yes. \"[Well, eventually] grave charges against the Templars during the Crusades included the allegation that they were fighting for themselves alone. More than one historical incident bears this out. The Christians had besieged the town of Ascalon in 1153, and were engaged upon burning down the walls with large piles of inflammable materials. Part of the wall fell after a whole night of this burning. The Christian army was about to enter, when the Master of the Temple (Bernard de Tremelai) claimed the right to take the town himself. This was because the first contingent into a conquered town had the whole spoil. As it happened, the garrison rallied and killed the Templars, closing the breach. There seem good grounds for believing that the power which they had gained caused the Templars to devote their efforts as much to their own Order's welfare as to the cause of the Cross, in spite of their tremendous sacrifices for that cause. Having no loyalty to any territorial chief, they obeyed their Master alone, and hence no softening political pressure could be put upon them. [Well,] this might well have led to an idea that they were an invisible super ‐ state [and that is exactly the fact]; and this does show some similarity with the invisible empire of the Assassins. If none can deny their bravery, their high ‐ handedness and exclusivity, in less than a hundred and fifty years after their founding gave them the reputation of considering themselves almost a law unto themselves.\" [William Cooper]: And now, dear listeners, we get into the meat, the direct connection between the historical events and the events that are happening today. Don't miss even one episode of this series. Good night, and may God bless each and every one of you.

Well, folks, we've been getting calls from all over the nation, and even in some foreign countries. They have been worried. They've called Stan; his phone has been ringing off the hook. It seems some rather spurious and ambitious individuals have been spreading a rumor by word ‐ of ‐ mouth, by the written word, and even on talk radio all across this country that I am dead. Well, folks, here's my answer to that: (opening music: Still Crusin' , by The Beach Boys) To all of my regular listeners and all the ships at sea around the world: it’s me, William Cooper, speaking to you from the dead where I have, indeed, seen the light and I turned it off. [Reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"'One of the most disgraceful acts which stain the annals of the Templars,' says even one of their ardent admirers, 'occurred in the year 1155, when Bertrand de Blancford (whom William of Tyre calls a 'pious and God ‐ fearing man') was Master of the Order. In a contest for the supreme power in Egypt, which the viziers, bearing the proud title of Sultan, exercised under the phantom ‐ caliphs, Sultan Abbas who had put to death the Caliph his master found himself obliged to fly from before the vengeance of the incensed people. With his harem and his own and a great part of the royal treasures, he took his way through the desert. [Well,] a body of Christians, chiefly Templars, lay in wait for the fugitives near Ascalon. The resistance offered by the Moslems was slight and very ineffectual; Abbas himself was either slain or he fled, and his son Nasiredin professed his desire to become a Christian. The far larger part of the booty of course fell to the Templars; but this did not satisfy their avarice. They sold Nasiredin to his father's enemies for 60,000 pieces of gold...'\" [William Cooper]: Now, if you think that's a lot of money in this day and age, it was a veritable king’s ransom in that. \"'...and [they] stood by to see him bound hand and foot, and placed in a sort of cage or iron ‐ latticed sedan, on a camel to be conducted to Egypt, where a death by protracted torture awaited him.' \"It was not the Templars alone [folks] who were guilty of arrogance and worse. The Hospitallers had deteriorated from their first fine beginnings; and the annals of both Orders are not innocent of unpleasantness, though they are indeed well filled with tales of glory. The Hospitallers, for instance, refused to pay tithes to the Patriarch of Jerusalem, even going so far as to erect immense buildings in front of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, as a practical demonstration of their own importance. [Now] when the Patriarch entered his church, they rang [their bells] so loudly that he cannot make himself heard. There is an occasion recorded when 'the congregation was assembled in church, the Hospitallers rushed into it in arms, and shot arrows among them as if they were robbers or infidels. These arrows were collected and hung up on Mount Calvary, where Christ had been crucified, to the scandal of these recreant knights. On applying to Pope Adrian IV for redress, the Syrian clergy found him and his cardinals so prepossessed in favor of his enemies ‐‐ (laughs) bribed by them in fact, [it] was said ‐‐ that they had no chance of relief.' \"This, then, [folks] was the background of the rise of the Templars, and the flavor of their environment. [Now] if one adds to these elements the fact that various very heterodox sects ‐‐ gnostic, Manichae and the rest ‐‐ still lurked in the Holy Land, together with a 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"great deal of magic and superstition of every kind, [then] there is a possibility, to say the least, that the Templars were infected by it.\" [William Cooper]: The facts, indeed, show that they were not only infected, but taken by it, and were initiated into not only by the branch known as the Assassins, but veritably arose from the secret sects in Syria. \"The contention which has been made, that such heresies and archaic religions and practices do not survive until the Templar period, is demonstrably false, although much play has been made of it by those who defend the Order; for do such sects not endure there until this very day? [Hmm? Well,] this is not to say that the Templars were guilty of the practices which formed the substance of the confessions later to be wrung from them by barbaric torture, which we will examine in due course. But a secret tradition and magical rites may well have played a part in their hidden lore and practices. It should also be remembered[, folks,] that towards the end there were Templars who were of actual Palestinian birth, who would have every opportunity of absorbing the unorthodox beliefs of the many schools of a magico ‐ religious nature which existed in the area. The Grand Master Philip of Naploos ([in] 1167), for instance, was a Syrian, and many Crusaders were Levantine lords, whatever their original blood, speaking Arabic with perfection. \"It was 1162 that the Magna Carta of the Order was obtained by the Templars: the Bull Omne Datum Optimum , often described as the keystone of their power. [And] through this instrument they were able to consolidate their authority and preserve their secrets against intrusion. [They] were to find, too, that [it] did much to excite the envy of their opponents. \"Pope Adrian IV had died[; the] two rival popes were elected: Alexander III by the Sicilian group, and Victor III by the imperial party. At first the Templars acknowledged Victor; but in 1161 they switch their allegiance to Alexander. There was probably some sort of secret arrangement behind this, for by January 7th of the following year the famous Bull was issued. By the terms of this document, the Templars were released from all spiritual ties except to the Holy See [itself]; they were permitted to have special burial ‐ grounds in their own houses; they could have chaplains of their own; they had no tithes to pay; [William Cooper: which in that day and age was miraculous] and were allowed to receive tithes [William Cooper: which was absolutely incredible]. Nobody who had once entered the Order could leave it, except to join one with a stricter discipline. The stage[, dear listeners,] was set for clerical hatred of the Templars and Hospitallers (who had similar privileges) [William Cooper: and in fact were one and the same and still are today], although the advantages to the Pope [from] the combined support of these two Orders could hardly be overestimated. \"In 1184 an incident occurred which inspired a great deal of distrust of the Order although the rarity of its occurrence should have underlined the fact that it was nothing of much consequence. [You see,] the English knight, Robert of St. Albans left the Templars, became a Moslem, and led an army for Saladin against Jerusalem, then in the hands of the Franks. The charge against the Templars that they were secret Mussulmans or allies with the Saracens does not seem borne out by the fact that Saladin accused them of treacherous truce ‐ breaking and other crimes and ‐‐ unlike his usual chivalrous self ‐‐ took a solemn oath that he would execute such Templar captives as he could obtain, as 'beyond the limits of Islam and infidelity alike.' Nor did they make any [attempts] to invoke any religious bond with Saladin when they were captured, as we know from the Arabic Life of Saladin written contemporaneously by his secretary, Qadi Yusuf. Strong evidence of this is given in the events which followed the terrible Battle of Hittin. Two years before, Saladin had made a pact with the Assassins that they would give him a free hand to continue [his] Holy War against the Franks [William Cooper: which we discussed on an earlier program]. On July 1st, 1187, he captured Tiberias. He attacked nearby Hittin at dawn on Friday, July 3rd. Thirty thousand [William Cooper: Christians... 30,000 Christians ] were captured, including the King of Jerusalem. No Templar[, not one,] is mentioned in the detailed Arab account as asking for mercy on religious or other grounds, although all knew that Saladin had issued a war ‐ cry: 'Come to death, Templars!' The Grand Master, Gerard of Ridefort, and several other knights were among those taken. Saladin offered them their lives if they would see the light of the True Faith. [William Cooper: Well, according to history,] none accepted, and all these knights were beheaded except, admittedly, the Templar Grand Master.\" [William Cooper]: Could it be that he did accept the true faith, or the \"light of the true faith,\" as Saladin had put it? \"A non ‐ Templar, Reginald of Chatillon, tried to invoke the sacred code of Arab hospitality, and other Crusaders claimed that they were Moslems, and were spared: none of them were Templars or Hospitallers. Reginald and the Templars collectively were sentenced to death for breaking the truce and the 'war crime' of killing unarmed pilgrims to Mecca. Arab accounts include only a few references which could be construed as indicating any collusion with the Christian army. One says that on the Friday at midday ([and] the battle lasted for two days), Sultan Saladin issued the attack cry to be passed along the Sarasin host, 'On for Islam!', at which the striped banner of the Templars was raised, 'and [the] Emir Lion ‐ of ‐ the ‐ Faith said, \"Are those [Sultans] (Saladin) Yusef’s allies, of whom I have heard from the Reconnaisance men?\"' [Well,] this cannot be regarded as anything at all conclusive. The only other reference is to a body of Templars who went over to the Saracen side, and whose supposed descendants survive to this day as the Salibiyya ([which means] Crusader) tribe in north Arabia. \"This engagement[, folks,] spelt the end of real Western power in Palestine for over seven hundred years, although it did stimulate the unsuccessful Third Crusade. Although the Templars ‐‐ and some other Crusaders ‐‐ were still in the Holy Land, they had lost almost all [of] their possessions there. But in the West lay the real seat of their power. At this time their European possessions numbered over 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"seven thousand estates and foundations. Although principally concentrated in France and England, they had extensive properties in Portugal, Castile, Leon, Scotland and Ireland, Germany, Italy, and Sicily. When Jerusalem was lost, their headquarters were transferred to Paris. This building, like all their branch churches, was known as the Temple. It was here that the French King Philip the Fair took refuge in 1306, to escape a civil commotion. It is said that this visit gave him his first insight into the real wealth of the order...\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, the wealth was not for the members, for they practiced the first true Socialism ‐‐ international Socialism, or Communism. \"...the fabulous treasures which his host showed him giving the bankrupt monarch the idea to plunder the knights on the pretext that they were dominated by heresies. \"Phillip the Fair was not entirely without some grounds for attacking the Templars. [For] in 1208 we find Pope Innocent III, a great friend of the Order, censuring them publicly for 'Causing their churches to be thrown open for Mass to be said every day with loud ringing of bells, bearing the cross of Christ on their breasts but not caring to follow his doctrines which [forbid] to giving offense to any of the little ones who believe in him. Following the doctrines of demons, they affix the cross of their Order upon the breast of every kind of scoundrel, asserting that whoever by paying two or three pence a year became one of their fraternity could not, even if interdicted, be deprived of Christian burial...and thus they themselves, being captive to the devil, cease not to make captive the souls of the faithful, seeking to make alive those whom they [knew] to be dead...' The first sign of an attempt to bring some sort of physical restraint upon the Templars came from Henry III of England. [For] in 1252 he hinted that he might try to seize some of the property of the Order: 'You prelates and religious,' he said, 'especially you Templars and Hospitallers, have so many liberties and charters that your enormous possessions make you rave with pride and haughtiness. What was imprudently given must therefore be prudently revoked; and what was inconsiderately bestowed must be considerately recalled.' [William Cooper: Those were the words of the King.] \"The Master of the Templars immediately replied: 'What sayest thou, O King? Far be it that thy mouth should utter so disagreeable and silly a word. So long as thou dost exercise justice thou wilt reign; but if thou infringe it, thou wilt cease to be King!'\" [William Cooper]: Now remember that the Knights Templar at that time were the very first international bankers. They were the wealthiest Order, wealthiest group, then known in the world ‐‐ even surpassing the kings of the different countries that existed. And even though the Hospitallers were created before the Knights Templar, eventually the two became the same Order, though to the public and to the rulers of Europe, they were different orders with different names. \"The haughty Templars of the fourteenth century owned land and revenues, gained steadily in honor and importance. They might have thrones had they wanted them; for such was their power towards the end that, banded together (as one historian points out), they could have overcome more than one of the smaller countries of Europe. Perhaps though, they [aimed] even higher than that. If their eventual aim was world hegemony, they could not have organized themselves better, or planned their aristocratic hierarchy more thoroughly. [William Cooper: And you will see that that's been carried over even onto the modern ‐ day.] The pride, arrogance, and complete confidence and self ‐ sufficiency of the Order is something [which] shows through even the least inspired pages of the chroniclers. Their power was legendary: \"'Everywhere they...had churches, chapels, tithes, farms, villages, mills,...rights of pasturage, of fishing, of venery, of wood. They had also in many places the right of holding annual fairs which were managed and the tolls received by some of the brethren of the nearest houses or by their donates or servants. The number of their [preceptories] is, by the most moderate computation, rated at nine thousand; the annual income of the Order put at about six million [pounds] sterling: an [unbelievable, unimaginable] sum [for] those times! Masters of such a revenue, descended from the noblest houses in Christendom, uniting in their purses the most [esteemed] secular and religious characters, regarded as the chosen champions of Christ and the flower of Christian knights, it was not possible for the Templars, in such lax times as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, to escape falling into the vices of [extravagant] luxury and overweening pride.' \"The Order, [folks,] when fully developed, was composed of several classes: chiefly knights, chaplains and serving ‐ brothers. Affiliated were those who were attached to the Order in worked for and received its protection, without taking its vows. [And] this affiliation was said to be derived from the Arab 'clientship' association, analogous to blood ‐ brotherhood and tribal associations. \"A candidate for knighthood should prove that he was of a knightly family and entitled[, yes, entitled,] to the distinction. His father must have been a knight or eligible to become one. He had to prove beyond any doubt that he was born in wedlock. The reason for this last requirement was said to be not only religious: there was the possibility that a political head such as a king or...prince might influence the Order by managing to have one of his bastard sons enter it, later perhaps to rise to high rank therein, and finally attaching it to the service of his dominion. 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"\"The candidate [for initiation] had to be unmarried and free from all obligations. He should have made no vow, nor entered any other Order; and he was not to be in debt. Eventually the competition for admission was so great from eligible people that a very high fee was exacted from those who were to be monk ‐ warriors of the Temple. \"All candidates were to be knighted before entry into the Order. But the period of probation which was originally demanded was before very long entirely abolished. No young man could be admitted until he was twenty ‐ one years of age, because he was to be a soldier as well as a monk, and this was the minimum age at which he could bear arms. \"When a new knight was admitted to the Order, the ceremony was held in secret. This fact, and persistent rumors, caused the belief that certain ceremonies and tenets were put into practice which deviated more than a little from the rituals of the Church. The ceremony was held in one of the Order's chapels, in the presence of the assembled chapter alone. \"The Master (or the Prior, who took his place in chapels other than those at which he was present) opened the proceedings: 'Beloved brethren, ye see that the majority are agreed to receive this man as a brother. If there be any among you who knows anything of him, on account of which he cannot lawfully become a brother, let him say it; for it is better that this should be signified beforehand then after he is brought before us.' \"[And] if no objection was lodged, the aspirant was sent to a small room with two or three experienced knights, to coach him in what he had to know: 'Brother, are you desirous of being associated with the Order?' If he [had] agreed, they would dwell up on the trials and rigors of being a Templar. [William Cooper: They would prepare him for initiation.] He had to reply that for the sake of God he was willing to undergo anything in remain in the Order for life; they asked him if he had a wife or was betrothed; had he made vows to any other Order; did he owe money more than he could pay; was he of sound mind and body; was he [the] servant of any person? \"[Well,] after satisfactory answers, the result was passed to the Master. The assembled company was then asked again if they knew anything that might disqualify him. [And] if none objected, they were asked: 'Are you willing that he should be brought in God's name?' The knights answered, 'Let him be brought in, in God's name.' \"He was now again asked by his sponsors if he still desired to enter the Order. Receiving an affirmative reply they led him to the chapter, where he folded his hands and flung himself upon his knees: 'Sir, I am come before God and before you for the sake of God and our dear Lady, to admit me into your Society, and the good deeds of the Order, as one who will be all his life long servant and slave of the Order.' \"'Beloved brother', answered the receptor, 'you are desirous of a great matter, for you see nothing but the outward shell of our Order.'\" [William Cooper]: Now let me repeat that again in case you weren't listening, folks. \"'Beloved brother,' answered the receptor, 'you are desirous of a great matter for you see nothing but the outward shell of our Order. It is only the outward shell when you see that we have fine horses and rich caparisons, that we eat and drink well and are splendidly clothed. From this you conclude that you will be well off with us. But you know not rigorous maxims which are in our interior. For it is a hard matter for you, who are your own master, to become the servant of another. You will hardly be able to perform, in future, what you wish yourself. For when you may wish to be on this side of the sea, you will be sent to the other side; when you will wish to be in Acre, you will be sent to the district of Antioch, to Tripolis, or to Armenia; or you will be sent to Apulia, to Sicily, or to Lombardy, or to Burgundy, France, England, or any other country where we have houses and possessions. [William Cooper: Where we wish you to do our will.] \"'[Further he says:] When you will wish to sleep, you will be ordered to watch; when you will wish to watch, then you will be ordered to go to bed; when you will wish to eat, then you will be ordered to do something else. And as both we and you might suffer great inconvenience from what you have mayhap concealed from us, look here on the holy evangelists and the word of God and answer the truth to the questions which we shall put to you; for if you lie you will be perjured, and may be expelled the Order, from which God keep you!' \"Now all the former questions were asked [on] Holy Writ. If the answers proved acceptable, the receptor continued: \"'Beloved brother, take good care that you have spoken the truth to us: for should you have spoken false in any one point, you might be put out of the Order ‐‐ from which God keep you! Now, beloved brother, attend strictly to what we shall say unto you. Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary to be, all your life long, obedient to the Master of the Temple, and to the Prior who shall be set over you?' \"[And initiate answers with:] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"\"[Again, he is asked,] 'Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, to live chaste of your body all your life long?' \"[And he answers,] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' \"[And he's again asked,] 'Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, to observe all your life long, the laudable manners and customs of our Order, both those which are already in use and those which the Master and Knights may add?' \"[And he answers,] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' \"[And then he's asked,] 'Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, that you will, with the strength and powers which God has bestowed on you, help as long as you live to conquer the Holy Land of Jerusalem; and that you will, with all your strength, aid to keep and guard that which the Christians possess?' \"[And he answers,] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' \"[And he's asked,] 'Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, never to hold (leave) this Order for stronger or weaker, for better or worse, than with permission of the Master, or of the chapter which has the authority?' \"[And he answers,] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' \"[And then he's asked,] 'Do you finally promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, never to be present when a Christian is unjustly and unlawfully despoiled of his heritage, and that you will never, by counsel or by act, take part therein?' \"[And he answers,] 'Yea, Sir, with the help of God!' \"[And then:] 'In the name, then, of God, and our dear Lady Mary, and in the name of St. Peter of Rome, and of our father the Pope, and in the name of all the brethren of the Temple, we receive to all the good works of the Order which have been performed from the beginning, and shall be performed to the end, you, your father, your mother, and all of your family whom you will let have share therein. In like manner do you receive us to all the good [work] which you have performed and shall perform. We assure you of bread and water and the poor clothing of the order, and labor and toil enow.' \"Then the candidate was admitted.\" [William Cooper]: Don't go away, folks. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: unknown orchestral music) [William Cooper, talking over music]: You're listening to the Hour of the Time. I'm William Cooper ‐‐ I am still alive, I am still kicking and I'm going to be around for a long, long time, much to the dismay of the Mystery Schools and international Socialism. Don't go away, folks. We'll begin again in just a few moments. (break music continues) [William Cooper]: With a joyous celebration the candidate was admitted.] \"The white mantle with its red cross was placed by the Master over the neck of the candidate, and clasped firmly by him. The Chaplain recited the 132nd psalm and the prayer of the Holy Ghost, and each brother repeated a paternoster. \"Then the Master and the Chaplain kissed the new entrant on the mouth. As he sat down before the Master, the latter delivered him a sermon on his duties. \"Knights were equipped more lightly than other Crusaders, and were issued with shields, sword, lance and mace. They were allocated three horses each, [William Cooper: not one with two knights riding, but three horses each] plus an esquire, who was either a serving ‐ brother or a layman, perhaps a youth from a noble family anxious to become a knight in his own turn. \"Retired knights were looked after by the Order, became counselors at meetings, and were eventually buried in coffins in their Templar 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"habit, with the legs crossed. Many Templar gravestones show the Knight with his feet up on a dog.\" [William Cooper]: But most show the crossed thighbones and the skull known as the Skull and Bones ‐‐ the same Skull and Bones as the Russell trust, the Brotherhood of Death at Yale, and the same Skull and Bones displayed upon the flag of the Pirates. \"It was Philip the Fair of France, bankrupt and fearful of the growing power of the warriors of the Temple, who laid the conspiracy for the suppression of the Order for all time. It has been hinted that Philip had some forewarning that a plot against the throne was afoot; that the Templars, frustrated in their attempts to win back the Holy Land, were about to turn upon Pope and King alike and try to overcome all Christendom.\" [William Cooper]: And, believe it or not, that's closer to the truth than anything that you ever heard about the Templars. \"In 1305, Pope Clement had been crowned through the assistance of the French King [William Cooper: and was actually under the control of the French King]; and Philip was ready to bring all the power of Church and State against the Knights of the Temple. \"There had been continued rivalry between the Templars and the Hospitallers [William Cooper: on the surface, underneath, they were one and the same]; and Clement, six months after his enthronement, wrote asking them to visit him for a conference, ostensibly for the purpose of making plans for aiding the kings of Armenia and Cyprus. The Pope was, however, hoping that he could effect a reconciliation between the two Orders, which would in turn strengthen his own position as their only ultimate head. William de Villaret, Master of the Hospital, was fully engaged in an attack upon the Saracens of Rhodes, when the invitation arrived, [and] could not obey it; but Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Temple, decided to accept. He handed over the defense of Limassol in Cyprus to the Order's Marshall, collected sixty knights, packed 150,000 gold florins plus much other treasure, and set sail for France. \"At Paris, De Molay was received with honors by the King who was plotting his downfall. In Poitiers, he met Clement, and discussed the possibilities of a fresh Crusade. De Molay opined that only a complete alliance of all Christendom could be of any avail against the Moslems, and that the amalgamation of the two Orders was not a good idea. The Grand Master returned to Paris; and almost at once rumors began to circulate about certain serious charges to be preferred against the Order. Troubled at this campaign, the master (together with Rimbaud de Caron, Preceptor of Outremer; Jeffrey de Goneville, Preceptor of Aquitane, and Hugh de Peraudo, Preceptor of France) returned to Poitiers to justify the Order before the Pope. \"An audience took place about April of 1307, in which the Pope mentioned the charges which have been made. The commission understood that their answers satisfied Clement, and returned to the capital in good heart. But this[, dear listeners,] was only the beginning. \"The method by which the charges were originally said to have been made was through a former Templar who had been expelled from the Order for heresy and other offenses. This Squin de Flexian found himself in prison, together with another man (a Florentine named Noffo Dei) and they thought (or were told) that they could obtain their release and a pardon for the crime of which they were currently accused if only they would testify against the Order. One account has it that de Flexian called for the governor of the prison, saying that he had a disclosure to make which he could tell the King personally; and which would be more to him than the conquest of [an entire] kingdom. Another chronicle has it that both men were degraded Templars, and had been actively engaged in the revolt against the King during which Philip had been forced to take refuge with the Templars. It is further stated that Cardinal Cantilupo, the Chamberlain to the Pope, who had been in an association with the Templars since he was eleven years old, had confessed some of their doings to his master. \"Ten main charges were made by de Flexian against the Order: \"1. Each Templar on his admission swore never to quit the Order, and to further its interests by right or wrong. \"2. The heads of the Order are in secret alliance with the Saracens, and they have more of Mohammedan infidelity than Christian faith. [And] proof of the latter includes that they make every novice spit upon the cross and trample upon it, and blaspheme [the] faith of Christ in various ways. \"3. The heads of the Order are heretical, cruel and sacrilegious men. Whenever any novice, on discovering the iniquity of the Order, tries to leave it, they kill him and bury the body secretly by night. They teach women who are pregnant by them how to procure abortion, and secretly murder [such] newborn children. \"4. They are infected with the errors of the Fratecelli; they despise the Pope and the authority of the Church; they scorn the sacraments, especially those of penance and confession. They pretend to comply with the rites of the Church simply to avoid detection. \"5. The superiors are addicted to the most infamous excesses of debauchery. If anyone expresses his repugnance to this, he is punished 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"by perpetual captivity. \"6. The Temple ‐ houses are the [receptacle] of every crime and abomination that can be committed. \"7. The Order works to put the Holy Land into the hands of the Saracens, and favors them more than the Christians. \"8. The Master is installed in secret and few of the younger brethren are present at this ceremony. It is strongly suspected that on this occasion he repudiates the Christian faith, or does something contrary to right. \"9. Many statutes of the Order are unlawful, profane and contrary to Christianity. [William Cooper: In fact, some of them are stone penises.] The members are therefore forbidden under pain of perpetual confinement to reveal them to anyone. \"10. No vice or crime committed for the honor or benefit of the Order is held to be a sin. \"[Now] these charges were later augmented by others which were collected through testimony from other enemies of the Order, and included such assertions as the use of the phrase Ya Allah ([which means] O, Allah!) and the adoration of an idol called the Head of Baphomet.\" [William Cooper]: In fact, the Head of Baphomet was not an idol that they worshiped but represented the receptacle of the intelligence, or the seat of the intelligence: the brain, the light, Lucifer, the gift of intellect, primordial knowing ‐‐ and that is what really the object of veneration was. \"Philip and his advisers prepared a great secrecy for the dissent upon this powerful organization[, the Knights Templar]. [And] on the 12th of September, 1307, sealed letters were sent to all the governors and Royal officers throughout France, instructing them to arm themselves on the twelfth of the next month and open the sealed orders ‐‐ and to act upon them forthwith. By the morning of Friday, October 13, [and on that day] almost every Templar in France was in the hands of the King's men.\" [William Cooper]: And thus was born the legend that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. And notice that it was October , Friday the 13th, the very first October surprise. \"Hardly one seems to have had any warning.\" [William Cooper]: But they did because, before the king acted, the Templars had moved their wealth, their treasure, and their holdings out of the country of France. \"On the day before his arrest, the Grand Master had actually been chosen by the King to be a pall ‐ bearer at a state funeral. \"The secret orders had it that all Templars were to be seized, tortured and interrogated. Confessions were to be obtained from them; pardon might be promised only if they confessed. And all their goods were to be expropriated.\" [William Cooper]: But the only thing that they really got was the actual real estate property held by the Templars in France and nowhere else. None of the gold, none of their wealth, none of their jewels, none of their treasures, none of the relics that have recovered from the Holy Land were ever found. \"The King himself took possession of the Temple at Paris as soon as the Grand Master and his knights were arrested. The next day the University of Paris assembled, together with canons and other functionaries and ministers; and the Chancellor declared that the knights had been proceeded against for heresy. Two days later the University met in the Temple and some heads of the Order, including the Grand Master, were interrogated. They are said to have confessed to 'forty years' guilt [William Cooper: whatever that means.] \"[Now] whether de Molay and others confessed on that occasion or not, the King was emboldened to publish an accusation, in which he called the knights 'polluters of the error and devouring wolves.' A public meeting was called in the Royal Gardens and addressed by monks and representatives on this subject. Edward II was the son ‐ in ‐ law of the French Philip, and to him was sent a priest who invited the English monarch to act at once against the Order in Britain. [Well,] Edward almost at once wrote to say that the charges seemed to him to be incredible. But Pope Clement wrote on November 22nd to London, assuring Edward that the Master of the Temple had confessed of his own free will that knights on their admission to the order had denied Christ. Others had admitted idolatry and other crimes. He therefore called upon the King of England to arrest all Templars within his domains, and to place their lands and goods in custody until their guilt or innocence should be ascertained; he condemned them to torture by the Dominican monks under the Inquisition until they confessed their guilt or were dead.\" 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: Now notice the date folks: November the 22nd in the year 1307 . That's a significant date in our history and has direct bearing, as you will see, many hours down the line. (William Cooper does an advertisement for an upcoming lecture) \"Before [the King of England] received this missive, [he] seems to have been sorely troubled by the allegations. He wrote, on November [the] 26th, to the Seneschal of Agen, asking about the charges. On the 4th of December he wrote to the kings of Portugal, Castile, Aragon and Sicily, asking 'what they had heard, and adding that he had given no credit to it.' He wrote to the Pope himself on December [the] 10th, expressing disbelief of what the French King said, and begging His Holiness to institute an inquiry [Well folks,] by December [the] 15th, when the Papal Bull arrived, Edward felt that he must act upon it without question. On December [the] 26th he wrote to the Pope that his orders would be obeyed. [But] in the interim, Edward had sent word to Wales, Scotland and Ireland that the Templars were all to be seized, as in England; but they were to be treated with kindness. \"On October [the] 19th, less than a week after they had been arrested [in France], 140 prisoners were being tortured by the Dominican Imbert, in the Paris Temple. Promises and the rack produced many confessions. Thirty ‐ six of the examinees died during these proceedings. Throughout France the racks worked overtime, and the confessions poured forth. [William Cooper: Many good men were crippled for the rest of their lives.] Many of these were contradictory and confused; [and] perhaps there is little wonder of that.\" [William Cooper]: How many of you could resist, even for five minutes, the tortures of the medieval Inquisition? \"The Pope now seemed a little uneasy at the arbitrary methods which were being employed. Philip wrote sharply to him saying that he, the King, was doing God's work, and rendered accounts to God alone. He offered to turn over all the goods of the Templars to the service of the Holy Land, Clement, still a weakling, merely stipulated that the inquisitions of each Bishop should be confirmed by a Provincial Council, and that the examination of the heads of the Order should be reserved to himself. Now we hear a constant succession of confessions and retractions, allegations that the heads of the Order confessed completely and spontaneously to the Pope himself. The Pope himself, for some unexplained reason, [folks,] tried to escape to Bordeaux, but was stopped by the King. Now he was the monarch's captive as well as his creation. \"Detailed confessions of individual Templars have been kept on record, many of them undoubtedly obtained by extreme racking and other tortures. The Templars who were prepared to defend the Order in court were brought to Paris, to the number of five hundred and forty ‐ six. Deprived of their knightly habits, and the sacraments of the Church, they [had] no means to acquire defense counsel. Their numbers rose to nine hundred, and now they clamored for the presence of the Grand Master, who was held elsewhere. An Act of Accusation in the name of the Pope was drawn up, and seventy ‐ five Templars throughout the Defense. \"The accusation had it now that 'At the time of their reception they were made to deny God, Christ, the Virgin, etc., and in particular to declare that Christ was not the true God, but a false prophet, who had been crucified for his own crimes and not for the redemption of the world. They spat and trampled upon the cross, especially on Good Friday. They worshiped a cat, which sometimes appeared in their chapters. Their priests, when celebrating Mass, did not pronounce the words of consecration. They believed that their Master could absolve them from their sins. They were told at their reception that they might abandon themselves to all kinds of licentiousness. They have idols in all their provinces, some with three faces, some with one. They worshiped these idols in their chapters, believed that they could save them, regarded them as the givers of wealth to the order and of the fertility to the earth; they touched them with cords which they afterwards tied around their own bodies [William Cooper: underneath their robes ‐‐ and that is still practiced today by Freemasons and by the Mormon Church]. Those who at the time of their reception would not comply with these practices were put to death or imprisoned.' \"The reply of the Templars denied every charge and stated that they had been subjected to every kind of illegality since their arrest. Fifty ‐ four of the knights who [had] volunteered to defend the Order were committed to the flames, having been declared relapsed heretics, before the trials had even started.\" [William Cooper]: And you'll see this number fifty ‐ four crop up later, and even in the modern ‐ day, and sometimes it's fifty ‐ four plus one ‐‐ the Grand Master, who later was burned at the stake. \"Four years to the day after the first arrests, the Pope led a convocation of one hundred and fourteen bishops to come to a final decision about the Templar Order. [Well, folks,] the prelates of Spain, England, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, and Scotland called for the Templars to be allowed to defend themselves. The Pope reported by closing the Session almost at once. [William Cooper: He would not hear of it.] Out of fifteen hundred to two thousand Templars who were in hiding in the vicinity, nine knights came forward to testify for the Order. The Pope doubled his guard and sent a message to the King to do the same, as there was still danger from the hidden knights. They were 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"not heard. Only one Italian prelate and three French ones voted to prevent the Order from putting in its defense. \"[Now] Philip, deciding that something should be done to hasten affairs, sent off for Venice and the conference. His arrival had an electric effect. On his sole authority the Pope almost immediately abolished the Order of a secret consistory. [And] this was on March 22nd, [in the year] 1313.\" [William Cooper]: And 1313 plays a significant number later on as that was a famous address in New Orleans, as some of you may remember. \"On May 2nd, when the Bull was published, the Order ceased officially to exist. The Grand Master, assumed but not proved to be guilty, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. Most of the other knights were released and many of these past their remaining days in poverty. De Molay and one of his chiefs, Guy of Auvergne, [pronounced or] proclaimed their innocence on the public stage to which they had been taken to have sentence announced. The King, upon hearing [William Cooper: them recant their confession], immediately had them committed to the flames.\" [William Cooper]: And some say that, while he was being burned at the stake, that De Molay cursed both the Pope and the King of France, stating that within a certain short period of time, he would meet them...he would meet them in another life, in front of God, who would judge them for their crimes. And, believe it or not, folks, well within the period of time, which was not very long, both the Pope and the King of France were dead, and I'm sure joined Jacques DeMolay in front of God for their final judgment. [William Cooper]: We are in no way finished with the story of the Knights Templar. But until tomorrow night, good night, and God bless each and every one of you.

(opening music: The Rose , written by Bette Midler, performed by unknown artist) Ah, yes, the seed that lies beneath the snow, in the springtime becomes the rose. I'm going to begin tonight's broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, by reading a portion of the introduction of a book, entitled Born in Blood: , by John J. Robinson, The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry . Now, you should seek out this book, purchase it and read it. It is a wonderful edition to your own library, and I begin now: [Reading from Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry , written by John J. Robinson]: \"The research behind this book is not originally intended to reveal anything about Freemasonry or the Knights Templar. Its objective had been to satisfy my own curiosity about certain unexplained aspects of the Peasants' Revolt in England in 1381, a savage uprising that saw upwards of a hundred thousand Englishmen march on London. They moved in uncontrolled rage, burning down manor houses, breaking open prisons, and cutting down any who stood in their way. \"One unsolved mystery of that revolt was the organization behind it. For several years, a group of disgruntled priests of the lower clergy had traveled the towns, preaching against the riches and corruption of the church. During the months before the uprising, secret meetings had been held throughout central England by men weaving a network of communication. After the revolt was put down, rebel leaders confessed to being agents of a 'Great Society,' said to be based in London. So very little is known of that alleged organization that several scholars have solved the mystery simply by deciding that no such secret society ever existed. \"Another mystery was the concentrated and especially vicious attacks on the religious order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John, now known as the Knights of Malta. Not only did the rebels seek out their properties for vandalism and fire, but their prior was dragged from the Tower of London to have his head struck off and placed on London Bridge, to the delight of the cheering mob. \"There was no question that the ferocity that was unleashed on the crusading Hospitallers had a purpose behind it. One captured rebel leader, when asked for the reasons for the revolt, said, 'First, and above all...the destruction of the Hospitallers.' What kind of secret society could have that special hatred as one of its primary purposes? \"A desire for vengeance against the Hospitallers was easy to identify in the rival crusading order of the Knights of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. The problem was that those Knights Templar have been completely suppressed almost seventy years before the Peasants' Revolt, following several years during which the Templars had been imprisoned, tortured and burned at the stake. After issuing the decree that put an end to the Templar order, Pope Clement V had directed that all of the extensive properties of the Templars should be given to the Hospitallers. Could a Templar desire for revenge actually survive underground for three generations? \"There was no incontrovertible truth, yet the only evidence suggest the existence of just one secret society in fourteenth ‐ century England [William Cooper: just one], the society that was, or would become, the order of Free and Accepted Masons. There appeared to be no connection, however, between the revolt and Freemasonry, except for the name or title of its leader. He occupied the center stage of English history for just eight days and nothing is known of him except that he was the supreme commander of the rebellion. He was called Walter the Tyler, and it seemed at first to be mere coincidence that he bore the title of the enforcement officer of the Masonic lodge. In Freemasonry the Tyler, who must be a Master Mason, is the sentry, the sergeant ‐ at ‐ arms, and the officer who screens the credentials of visitors who seek entrance to the lodge. In remembrance of an earlier, more dangerous time, his post is just outside the door of the Lodge room, where he stands with a drawn sword in his hand [William Cooper: even to this day]. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"I was aware that there had been many attempts in the past to link the Freemasons with the Knights Templar, but never with success. The fragile evidence advanced by proponents of that connection had never held up, sometimes because it was based on wild speculation, and at least once because it had been based on a deliberate forgery. But despite the failures to establish that link, it just will not go away, and the time ‐ shrouded belief in some relationship between in two orders remains as one of the more durable legends of Freemasonry. That is entirely appropriate, because all of the various theories of the origin of Freemasonry are legendary. Not one of them is supported by any universally accepted evidence.\" [William Cooper]: Ah, here I break from reading from the introduction of the book and interject a comment here. There was never any universally accepted evidence until you hear what you're going to hear tonight, produced by John Galt, an agent of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence [CAJI]. The connection, dear listeners, is in the genealogy of the families of the elite. You are going to be amazed, and now I continue from the introduction to Born in Blood : \"I was not about to travel down that time ‐ worn trail, and decided to concentrate my efforts on digging deeper into the history of the Knights Templar to see if there was any link between the suppressed Knights and the secret society behind the Peasants' Revolt. In doing so, I thought that I would be leaving Freemasonry far behind. [And] I couldn't have been more mistaken. \"Like anyone curious about medieval history, I had developed an interest in the Crusades, and perhaps more than just an interest. Those holy wars hold an appeal that is frequently as romantic as it is historical, and in my travels I had tried to drink in the atmosphere of the narrow defiles in the mountains of Lebanon through which Crusader armies had passed, and had sat staring into the castle ruins Sidon and Tyre, trying to hear the clashing sounds of attack and defense. I had marveled at the walls of Constantinople and had strolled the Arsenal of Venice, where Crusader fleets were assembled. I had sat in the round church of the Knights Templar in London, trying to imagine the ceremony of its consecration [by] the Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1185, more than three hundred years before Columbus set sail west to the Indies. \"The Templar order was founded in Jerusalem in 1118, in the aftermath of the First Crusade. Its name came from the location of its first headquarters on the site of the ancient Temple of Solomon, helping to fulfill a desperate need for a standing army in the Holy Land, the Knights of the Temple soon grew in numbers, in wealth, and in political power. They also grew in arrogance, and their Grand Master de Ridfort was a key figure in the mistakes that led to the fall of Jerusalem in 1187. The Latin Christians managed to hold on to a narrow strip of territory along the coast, where the Templars were among the largest owners of the land and [the] fortifications. \"Finally, the enthusiasm for sending men and money to the Holy Land waned among the European kingdoms, which were preoccupied with their wars against each other. By 1296 the Egyptian sultan was able to push the resident Crusaders, along with the military orders, into the sea. The Holy Land was lost, and the defeated Knights Templar moved their base to the island of Cyprus, dreaming of yet one more Crusade to restore their past glory. \"As the Templars planned to go on a new Crusade against the infidel, King Philip IV of France was planning his own private crusade against the Templars. He longed to be rid of his massive debts to the Templar order, which had used its wealth to establish a major [international] banking operation. Philip wanted the Templar treasure to finance his continental wars against Edward I of England. \"After two decades of fighting England on one side and the Holy Roman Church on the other, two unrelated events gave Philip of France the opportunity he needed. Edward I died, and his deplorably weak son took the throne of England as Edward II. On the other front, Philip was able to get his own man on the Throne of Peter as Pope Clement V. \"When word arrived on Cyprus that the new pope would mount a Crusade, the Knights Templar thought that their time of restoration to glory was at hand. Summoned to France, their aging Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, went armed with elaborate plans for the rescue of Jerusalem. In Paris, he was humored and honored until the fatal day. At dawn on Friday, the thirteenth of October, in the year 1307, every Templar in France was arrested and put in chains on Philip's orders. Their hideous tortures for confessions of heresy began immediately. \"When the pope's order to arrest the Templars arrived at the English court, young Edward II had took no action at all. He protested to the pontiff that the Templars were innocent. Only after the pope issued a formal Bull [William Cooper: on November the twenty ‐ second in the year 1307] was the English king forced to act. In January [William Cooper: in the year], 1308, Edward finally issued orders for the arrest of the Knights Templar in England, but the three months of warning had been put to good use. Many of the Templars had gone underground, while some of those arrested managed to escape. Their treasure, their jeweled reliquaries, even the bulk of their records, had [totally] disappeared. In Scotland, the papal order was not even published. Under those conditions England, and especially Scotland, became targeted havens for fugitive Templars from continental Europe, and the efficiency of their concealment spoke to some assistance from outside, or from each other. 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"\"The English throne passed from Edward II to Edward III, who bequeathed the crown to his ten ‐ year ‐ old grandson who, as Richard II, watched from the Tower as the Peasants' Revolt exploded throughout the city of London. \"Much had happened to the English people along the way. Incessant wars had drained the king's treasury and corruption had taken the rest. A third of the population had perished in the Black Death, and famine exacted further tolls. The reduced labor force of farmers and craftsmen found that they could earn more for their labor, but their increased income came at the expense of land ‐ owning barons and bishops, who were not prepared to tolerate such a state of affairs. Laws were passed to reduce wages, and prices to preplague levels in genealogies were search to reimpose the bondage of serfdom and villeinage on men who thought themselves free. The king's need for money to fight the French wars inspired new and ingenious taxes. The oppression was coming from all sides, and the pot of rebellion was brought to the boil. \"Religion didn't help, either. The landowning church was as merciless a master as the landowning nobility. Religion would have been a source of confusion for the fugitive Templars as well. They were a religious body of warrior monks who owed allegiance to no man on earth except the Holy Father [William Cooper: according to the Holy Father. But according to the Templars, in secret, their allegiance was only to themselves]. When their pope turned on them, chained them, beat them, he broke their link with God. In fourteenth ‐ century Europe there was no pathway to God except through the vicar of Christ on earth. If the pope rejected the Templars and the Templars rejected the Pope, they had to find a new way to worship their God, at a time when any variation from the teachings of the established church was blasted as heresy. \"That dilemma called to mind a central tenet of Freemasonry, which requires only that a man believe in a Supreme Being, with no requirements as to how he worships the deity of his choice. In Catholic Britain such a belief would have been a crime, but it would have accommodated the fugitive Templars who had been cut off from the universal church. In consideration of the extreme punishment for heresy, such an independent belief also...made sense of one of the more mysterious...of Freemasonry's Old Charges.\" [William Cooper]: The ancient rules that still govern the conduct of the fraternity. The charge says that no Mason should reveal the secrets of a brother that may deprive him of his life and property. That connection caused me to take a different look at the Masonic Old Charges. \"They took on new direction and meaning when viewed as a set of instructions for a secret society created to assist and protect fraternal brothers on the run and in hiding from the church. That characterization made no sense in the context of a medieval guild of stonemasons, the usual claim for the roots of Freemasonry. It did make a great deal of sense, however, for men such as the fugitive Templars, whose very lives depended upon their concealment. Nor would there have been any problem finding new recruits over the years ahead: There were to be plenty of protesters and dissidents against the church among future generations. The rebels of the Peasants' Revolt proved that when they attacked abbeys and monasteries, and when they cut off the head off of Archbishop of Canterbury, the leading Catholic prelate in England. \"The fugitive Templars would have needed a code such as the Old Charges of Masonry, but the working stonemasons clearly did not. It had become obvious that I needed to know about the Ancient Order of Free and Accepted Masons. The extent of the Masonic material available at large in public libraries surprised me, as did the fact that it was housed in the department of education and religion. Not content with just what was readily available to the public, I asked to use the library in the Masonic Temple in Cincinnati, Ohio.\" [William Cooper]: By the way, folks, Cincinnati, Ohio is an extremely important location in this country, the United States. \"I told the gentlemen there that I was not a Freemason, but wanted to use the library as part of my research for a book that would probably include a new examination of the Masonic order. His only question to me was, 'Will it be fair?' I assured him that I had no desire or intention to be anything other than fair, to which he replied, 'Good enough.' I was left alone with the catalog and the hundreds of Masonic books that lined the walls. I also took advantage of the publications of the Masonic Service Association in Silver Springs, Maryland. \"Later, as my growing knowledge of Masonry enabled me to sustain a conversation of the subject, I began to talk to Freemasons. At first, I wondered how I would go about meeting fifteen or twenty Masons and, if I could meet them, would they be willing to talk with me? The first problem was solved as soon as I started asking friends and associates if they were Masons. There were four in one group I had known for about five years, and many more among men I had known for twenty years and more, without ever realized that they had any connection with Freemasonry. As for the second part of my concern, I found them quite willing to talk, not about the secret passwords and hand grips (by then, I had already knew them), but about what they have been taught concerning the origins of Freemasonry and its ancient Old Charges. \"They were as intrigued as I about the possibilities of discovering the lost meanings of words, symbols, and ritual for which no logical explanation was available, such as why a Master Mason is told in his initiation rights that 'this degree will make you a brother to pirates 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"and corsairs.'\" [William Cooper]: And folks, I'll explain that to you (laughs) a little later. \"We agreed that unlocking the secrets of those Masonic mysteries would contribute most to unearthing the past, because the loss of their true meanings had caused the ancient terms and symbols to be preserved intact, lest subject to change over the centuries, or by adaptations to new conditions. \"Among those lost secrets were the meanings of words used in the Masonic rituals, words like tyler , cowan , due ‐ guard , and Juwes . Masonic writers have struggled for centuries, without success, to make those words fit with their preconceived convictions that Masonry was born in the English ‐ speaking guilds of medieval stonemasons. \"Now I would test the possibility that there was indeed a connection between Freemasonry and the French ‐ speaking Templar order. By looking for the lost meanings of those terms, not in English, but in medieval French. The answers began to flow, and soon a sensible meaning for every one of the mysterious Masonic terms was established in the French language. It even provided the first credible meaning for the name of Hiram Abiff, the murdered architect of the Temple of Solomon, who is the central figure of Masonic ritual. The examination established something else as well. It is well known that in 1362 the English courts officially changed the language used for court proceedings from French to English. So the French roots of all [of] the mysterious terms of Freemasonry confirmed the existence of that secret society in the fourteenth century, the century of the Templar suppression and the Peasants' Revolt. \"With that encouragement I addressed other lost secrets of Masonry: the circle and mosaic pavement on the lodge room floor, gloves and lambskin aprons, the symbol of the compass and the square, even the mysterious legend of the murder of Hiram Abiff. The Rule, customs and traditions of the Templars provided answers to all of those mysteries. Next, came a deeper analysis of the Old Charges of ancient Masonry that define a secret society of mutual protection. What the 'lodge' was doing was assistance brothers in hiding from the wrath of church and state, providing them with money, vouching for them with the authorities, even providing the 'lodging' that gave Freemasonry the unique term for its chapters and its meeting rooms. There remained no reasonable doubt in my mind that the original concept of the secret society that came to call itself Freemasonry had been born as a society of mutual protection among fugitive Templars and their associates in Britain, men who had gone underground to escape the imprisonment and torture that had been ordered for them by Pope Clement V. Their antagonism toward the Church was rendered more powerful by its total secrecy. The suppression of the Templar order appeared to be one of the biggest mistakes the Holy See [has] ever made. \"In return, Freemasonry has been the target of more angry papal bulls and encyclicals than any other secular organization in Christian history. Those condemnations began just a few years after Masonry revealed itself in 1717 and grew in intensity, culminating in the bull Humanum Genus, promulgated by Pope Leo XIII in 1884. In it, the Masons are accused of espousing religious freedom, the separation of church and state, the education of children by laymen, and the extraordinary crime of believing that people have the right to make their own laws and to elect their own government, 'according to the new principles of liberty.'\" [William Cooper]: You see, folks, and this is an aside, all of our forefathers who have established this country were Freemasons, and their intent is spelled out in Latin on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States of America, where it plainly says, Novus Ordo Seclorum : the New World Order. And I will interpret all of the meaning of the symbols on that Great Seal according to their true meaning , and not the meaning the you read in certain disinformation books written by Freemasons to steer you down the wrong road. \"Such concepts are identified, along with the Masons, as part of the kingdom of Satan. The document not only defines the concerns of the Catholic Church about Freemasonry at that time, but, in the negative, so clearly defines what Freemasons believe that I have included the complete text of that papal bull as an appendix to this book.\" [William Cooper]: ...and I urge you all to get this book and read it. \"Finally, it should be added that the events described here were part of a great watershed of Western history. The feudal age was coming to a close. Land, and the peasant labor on it, had lost its role as the sole source of wealth. Merchant families banded into guilds, and took over whole towns with charters as municipal corporations. Commerce led to banking and investment, and towns became power centers to rival the nobility in wealth and influence. \"The universal church, which had fought for a position of supremacy in a feudal context, was slow to accept changes that might affect that supremacy. Any material disagreement with the church was called heresy, the most heinous crime under heaven. The heretic not only deserved death, but the most painful death imaginable. \"Some dissidents run for the woods and hide, while others organize. In the case of the fugitive Knights Templar, the organization already existed. They possessed a rich tradition of secret operations that had been raised to the highest level through their association with the 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"intricacies of Byzantine politics, the secret ritual of the Assassins [and the Roshaniya], and the intrigues of the Moslem courts which they met alternately on the battlefield or at the conference table. The church, in its bloody rejection of protest and change, provided them with a river of recruits that flowed for centuries. \"More than six hundred years have passed since the suppression of the Knights Templar, but their heritage lives on in the largest fraternal organization ever known. And so the story of those tortured crusading knights, of the savagery of the Peasants' Revolt, and of the lost secrets of Freemasonry becomes the story of the most successful secret society in the history of the world. [William Cooper]: I've got to take a break, folks. Don't go away. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: When You Wish Upon A Star , music by Leigh Harline, lyrics by Ned Washington, performed by unknown artist) [No longer reading]: Spurned by God in the form of the vicar of Christ on earth, the Pope, and spurning God in their turn, the Knights Templars banded together in secret and formed what was to become known as Freemasonry. Now, the legend goes that Freemasonry sprang up from ancient stonecutters, guilds, and the men who built the stone buildings of the age. But \"Freemason\" actually comes from the French: frère ‐ maçon , which literally means, \"The Sons of Light.\" Which light will certainly, in researching the problem, that it is not the light of Christ. It is the light of the fallen angel of light, for when they were forsaken by the church, by Christ vicar on earth, the Pope, they spurned God and turned to Lucifer. They held to the Luciferian philosophy that the gift of intellect by Lucifer, through his agent Satan, would in its turn make man god. These men were always on the run. They took the hidden Templar wealth and built a financial empire that stands to this day is the most powerful on the earth [sic]. Jews, who had traditionally been persecuted throughout Europe, flocked to the hidden Temple, for there they could believe as they wished and worshiped whatever god they wished, for all were welcome. Many of the Templars running [to ground] flocked to England and to Scotland, where they fought for Robert the Bruce, who was engaged in an intense battle with the King of England. Now, let me regress just a little bit. King William the Lion, who was born in 1165 and died in 1214, had a daughter, Isabel of Scotland. Well, Isabel married a certain Robert Rose [Roos] . Robert Rose [Roos] was a Knights Templar who was heavily involved in the first efforts ‐‐ and was very successful ‐‐ at international banking. Plus, he established the first overt and covert international intelligence gathering organization which all, all subsequent intelligence organizations had been based upon since. His son, Sir William Roos, and his daughter, Lucy Roos, figure prominently in the story to follow. Lucy married Sir Robert Plumpton. They sired two children: Sir William Plumpton and Alice Plumpton. During this period of time, this family, this family, as the Knights Templar were going to ground, in the male progeny of this family always followed in their father's footsteps and entered into the order. They established, in secret, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and may have had a significant role in the establishment, for intelligence reasons, of the order known as the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross. Now, Alice Plumpton married Sir John Boteler. They gave birth to a daughter, Alice Boteler, who then married John Gerard, who had a child, Constance, who married Sir Alex Standish. The following children issued from that marriage: Ralph Standish, Sir Alex Standish, Roger Standish, and Alice Standish, who then married James Prescott. The children of this marriage were Roger Prescott, Ralph Prescott, John Prescott, and Captain Jonathan Prescott. Jonathan Prescott married Rebecca Buckley. They had two children, Abel Prescott and Lucy Prescott, and Lucy married Jonathan Fay. They sired three children: Samuel Prescott Phillips Fay, Samuel Howard Fay, and Harriet Eleanor Fay. Harriet married Reverend James Smith Bush, son of merchant Obidiah [Newcomb] Bush. Their son, Samuel Prescott Bush, became the president of Buckeye Steel Castings Company of Ohio. A pioneer family of Franklin, Ohio between Dayton and Cincinnati, and was one of the members of the Golden Circle and Order of the Quest, also known as the JASON Society, which gave issue to most of the political elite of the United States of America, who are, by the way, all (and I mean all without exception ) related to each other. Now, Samuel Prescott Bush married, and his son Prescott Bush became a U.S. Senator from Connecticut, the director of Prudential Insurance, the director of CBS, a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, chairman, National Republican Finance Committee, funds placed in Merrill Lynch accounts in Switzerland under the guidance of Donald Reagan. When he married, that marriage gave issue to the following: Prescott Bush II: an investment banker indicted for fraudulent banking practices. George Bush: Chairman of Zapata Oil from 1963 ‐ 64; Chairman of Republican Party, Harris County, Texas, when J.F. Kennedy was killed; delegate to the GOP National Convention (1964); 1968 member of the 90th and 91st Congress from Texas; from 1965 ‐ 66, Nixon appointed Bush as ambassador to the United Nations to deal with China; he was the director for the Central Intelligence Agency; Chairman of the GOP party; Vice President of the United States of America; and President of the United States of America. 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Four other children were William H. Bush, James Bush, Jonathan Bush, and Nancy, who married Alex Ellis. The issue of George and Barbara Bush was: Dorothy, who married William LeBlond; John Ellis Bush; Neil Bush, son of the director of CIA, becomes director of Silverado Savings and Loan and launders CIA drug money. Silverado loses over $100 million dollars and Neil goes unpunished. And the two other children? Marvin Pierce Bush and George Bush II. Folks, this intelligence was gathered by one of our agents, code named \"John Galt,\" who spent literally years in dusty libraries and books of genealogy. And I'm not going to tell you which libraries or how he arrived at this information. But it has been checked, it is absolutely accurate and this is just one portion of the pedigree of George Bush, who's literally related to most of the royal families of Europe. Now, you can have a copy of this chart if you want it. I'll tell you how to get it later, so have your pencils and paper ready. I'm going to tell you exactly where the money goes. One half of the money goes to help pay for the airtime here; the other half goes to our agent, John Galt, to pay for the years of toil and dusty library books that nobody ever looks in, tracing genealogy. And folks, this is only one of the charts that he has furnished to us, along with others, other agents of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence [CAJI], who are engaged in the exact same research. And we have found that our most productive connections of the secret societies, the royal families, and what's happening in the world today, is through genealogy. We have found a direct connection between the Peasants' Rebellion [Revolt] in England, the French Revolution, the Ronald Reagan and George Bush political campaign, and the George Bush political campaign. As far as the Peasants' Rebellion goes, the Encyclopedia Britannica calls it a \"curiously spontaneous rebellion.\" Barbara Tuchman, in her fourteenth century history, a distant mirror, said the rebellions spread \"with some evidence of planning.\" Winston Churchill went even further. In his work, The Birth of Britain , he wrote: \"Throughout the summer of 1381, there was a general ferment. Beneath it all lay organization. Agents moved round the villages of central England, in touch with a 'Great Society' which was said to meet in London...the spark of rebellion was being fanned vigorously, and finally the signal was given. Even though he had been arrested, excommunicated, and even now was a prisoner in the Ecclesiastic prison at Maidstone in Kent, letters went out from priests John Ball and from other priests who followed him. Clerics were then the only literate class, so letters must have been received by local priests who were obviously intended to be shared with or read aloud to others. They all contained a signal to act now, which could put to rest the concept that the rebellion was simply a spontaneous convulsion of frustration that just happened to affect the hundred thousand Englishmen all at the same time.\" This, from a letter from John Ball. In it he says, \"John Ball greeteth you well all, and doth you to understand that he hath rongen your bell. Now right and might, will and skill. Now God speed [haste you in] every dele [William Cooper: which means 'ideal'], [now is time].\" From priest Jake Carter: \"You have great need to take God with you in all of your deeds, for now is time to be war.\" From priest Jake Trewman: \"Jake Trewman doth you to understand that falseness and gile reigned too long and truth hath been set under a lock, and falseness reignth in evervil flock. God do bote, for now is time.\" Now, you'll notice that in every one of those quotes, there was one phrase that stands out and that phrase is \"now is time.\" One letter from John Ball, \"Saint Mary Priest,\" is worth quoting in its entirety. Even with the medieval English spelling, the meaning will be clear. Lechery and gluttony were frequent points in his accusations of high church leaders: \"John Ball, Saint Mary’s Priest, greets well all manner [of] men [and] bids 'em in the name of the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, stand manly together in truth, and helpeth truth, and truth shall help you. Now reigneth pride in price, and covetousness is held wise, and lechery without shame, and gluttony without blame. Envy reigneth with treason, and sloth is taken in great season. God do bote, for now is time. Amen.\" Now, folks, if you research the history of the French Revolution, you will hear that the spark, the word that spread through the country like wildfire that ignited the rebellion in France was \"now is the time.\" Literally, the same phrase. Some say that in the American Revolution the same phrase was heard and we find mention of it in several texts, but not like it was heard in the Peasants' Revolt in England, and not like it was heard in the French Revolution. But it was heard again in modern times. It was the campaign slogan of the Bush/Reagan campaign, and was used again in the Bush campaign: \"Now is the time.\" Now is the time. One famous photograph staged by George Bush [Sr.] and selected by George Bush for publication in Life Magazine shows him lying in bed, holding the pyramid with the capstone in place, signaling to Masons, Freemasons, and members, the priests of the Mystery Schools 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"around the world, that he is the one who will bring into fruition their ages ‐ , centuries ‐ , millennia ‐ old dream of the New World Order. In our search for the Templars, we have followed them right to their gravestones, and on some of their gravestones it shows the knight, leaning back, reclining with his feet resting up on a dog, denoting that he is the master. On most of the tombstones, however, we have found something unexpected: the skull and crossbones. Now, when the Knights Templars were persecuted, the fleet ‐‐ they have vast fleets, an entire navy ‐‐ disappeared. And no one, at least no one in the establishment historian group, claims to know where they went. But we have found them folks. They became the pirates and hoisted their symbol of the skull and bones to the yardarm. They became the vast fleet of pirates who roamed the seas of the world and terrorized nations, navies and merchantmen. And thus arose, from the initiation rights of the Templars, the initiatory rights of crossing the equator, the International Date Line and others; and accounts for the brotherhood amongst the pirates of the world. Even to establishing seaports that they owned and operated, and where they could always find safety. Those on the land established what they called the \"Brotherhood of Death.\" Chapters were formed throughout the world. George Bush was initiated in the crypt, or what is known as the tomb at Yale into the Brotherhood of Death, also known as the Russell Trust, also known as the Skull and Bones. The research of many people have revealed what the interior of the crypt, or what is known as the tomb at Yale, the fraternity house of the Bonesmen, contains. And Anthony C. Sutton, in his monumental work, America's Secret Establishment , all about the Skull and Bones, and one other who wrote a magazine article and published it, revealed the initiation ceremony, revealed that swastikas were found inside the tomb, revealed that the altar is a pile of bones and that the secret ceremony that George Bush underwent during his initiation was thus: [reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"On the day of his initiation, [George Bush] was conducted through a long dark passage into an immense hall draped with black. He was able to see, by the faint light of sepulchral lamps, corpses [William Cooper repeats: corpses ] in their shrouds. The altar, built of human skeletons, stood in the center. Ghostly forms moved through the hall, leaving behind them a foul odor. At length two men, dressed as spectres, appeared and tied a pink band or ribbon smeared with blood around his forehead. Upon this was an image of the Lady of Loretto. A crucifix was placed in his hand, and an amulet hung around his neck. His clothes were removed and laid upon a funeral pyre [William Cooper: in a fireplace], while upon his body crosses were smeared in blood. Then his pudenda were tied with string [William Cooper: that's his genitals]. \"Now five horrid and frightening figures, bloodstained and mumbling, approached him and threw themselves down in prayer. After an hour, sounds of weeping were heard, the funeral pyre started to burn, and his clothes were consumed. From the flames of this fire a huge and almost transparent form arose, while the five prostrate figures went into terrible convulsions. Now came the voice of an invisible hierophant, booming from somewhere below [as George Bush lay in a coffin naked]. The words were those of these oaths, which the candidate had to repeat: \"'In the name of the crucified one, I swear to sever all bonds which unite me with mother, brothers, sisters, wife, relatives, friends, mistress, kings, superiors, benefactors, or any other man to whom I have promised faith, service, or obedience; \"'I name the place in which I was born. Henceforth I live in another dimension, which I will not reach until I have renounced the evil globe which has been cursed by Heaven; \"'For now onwards I shall reveal to my new chief all that I have heard or found out; and I shall also seek out and observe things which might have otherwise have escaped me; \"'I honor the aqua toffana ; it is a quick and essential medium of removing from the earth, through death or robbing them of their wits, of those who oppose truth, and those who try to take it from our hands; \"'I shall avoid Spain, Naples, and all other accursed lands, and I shall avoid the temptation to betray what I have now of heard; \"'Lightning will not strike as rapidly as the dagger, which will reach me, wherever I may be, should I betray my initiation.' \"Now a candelabrum, bearing seven black candles, is placed before the candidate, and also a bowl containing [what is supposed to be] human blood. He washes himself in the blood, and drinks a quantity of it. The string around his [genitalia] is removed, he is placed in a bath to undergo complete ablution. After this, he eats a meal composed of root vegetables.\" [William Cooper]: At this time, he is given his new name by which he will be known to all of the others in the order, the Brotherhood of Death. And with the completion of his initiation, George Bush joined all of the male members of his family in a long line of ancestry, 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"traced from Robert Roos to the modern day. He took his place in the order, the Knights Templar, Freemasonry, and has worked diligently to fulfill his role in the completion of the plan, The Great Work the formation of the New World Order, the one ‐ world totalitarian socialist state, the destruction of all existing nation states, all existing religions, and enslavement of the mob. \"The very highest degrees of the order show that the rationalism and materialism of the thinkers who developed it were determined to stamp out belief in religion. God and any faith in a deity, the initiate were told, were human inventions, and no real meaning. Subsequently this was developed further, and the member who arrived at the highest position (that of Rex, or King) learned that he is now equal to a king, and that all men were capable of equal advancement: hence, the need for kings over ordinary mortals was an illusion.\" [William Cooper]: And that at the highest rank, the title of Rex Mundi, or King of the World, is assumed.

I'm William Cooper. (opening music: Main theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark , written by John Williams) [reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"The sixteenth century saw the rise of a very powerful society based upon a secret cult, in the mountains of Afghanistan ‐‐ the Roshaniya, [or the] illuminated ones. References to the existence of this mystical fraternity exist from the time of the House of Wisdom at Cairo, several hundred years before.\" [William Cooper]: In fact, the Roshaniya are just a later emergence of the old cult of the Assassins. \"It seems likely the small branches were founded in various parts of the near and Middle East; which would account for the special usage of the names of the eight degrees of initiation among them. \"The earliest figure named in the history of the cult is one Bayezid Ansari, of Afghanistan, whose family claimed descent from the Ansar ‐‐ the 'Helpers', who assisted Mohammed after his flight from Mecca nearly fourteen hundred years ago. As a reward for this service, he stated, his ancestors had been granted initiation into the mysteries of the Ishmaelite religion: the secret, inner training [which] dated from Abraham's rebuilding of the Temple at Mecca, the mystical Harem.\" [William Cooper]: To the Assassins, through the Roshaniya and into Europe via the Knights Templar. \"Bayezid’s own father, however, was known to be as narrowly conventional as anyone in the country, and one account of the rapid rise of the sect has it that Bayezid, after a period of preparation for the normal priesthood, was converted to his strange doctrine by a missionary from the Ismailis, the sectarians holding a secret doctrine supposedly handed down in the family of the Prophet, who maintained hidden lodges throughout the world of Islam and also claimed (after the Crusades) to have penetrated with their ideas even Spain, Germany, France and parts of Britain. \"However this may be, the Illuminated Ones soon became more than a headache for the governors of Afghanistan, the Mogul rulers of India, and their Persian neighbors. Not far from Peshawar, which is now in the north ‐ west of Pakistan, Bayezid set up a small school, where he carefully coached those who had been initiated by him in the knowledge of the supernatural that he claimed. A period of probation was expected from each candidate, during which [he] would go into periods of concealment or meditation, known as khilwat ‐‐ [or] silence. During this time he was to receive the illumination which was emanated from the supreme being, who desired a class of perfect men ‐‐ and women ‐‐ to carry out the organization and direction of the world. \"Bayezid collected in this way, over a period of three years, about fifty staunch disciples, whom he had trained in obedience and to whom ‐‐ so we are told ‐‐ he had shown a way whereby they could liberate their 'inner powers'. [Well,] this meant that they were ready to follow his further instructions. These orders, according to what his opponents say, were that the whole sect would now become bandits, to prey upon the rest of the world.\" [William Cooper]: And all those who could not identify themselves by their secret signs were their legal and lawful prey. \"Little information is available from the other side, but three letters said to have been written from one branch to another contain in 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"outline a plan to reshape the [entire] social system of the world: first, taking control of individual countries, one by one.\" [William Cooper]: And where have we heard that before? We’ve heard it from every one of the histories of all of these different sects of Mystery Babylon, which on the outward appearance seem to be different from each other. On the esoteric level are one and the same religion with one and the same same plan, with one and the same same goal, all working toward that end. And the end always, always, justifies the means. \"[Now,] something does survive the degrees of initiation. The first was Salik (seeker); followed by Murid (disciple); Fakir (humble devotee); Arif (enlightened one); Khwaja (master); Emir (commander); Imam (priest), and Malik (chief or king). This succession does not follow the usual pattern of promotion in the Moslem mystical secret societies, the tarikas; and seems to have been especially devised for this one. In the first three degrees, the candidate perfected himself by repetitions of certain phrases which were believed to carry power. Examples are these: rabba; aferinaa; hayya; hafida; quwwaya . \"Of these words (all Arabic or Persian) the first stands for the concept of lordship, the second for creation, the third for life, the fourth for protection, and the last for absolute power. If they were repeated, with deep meditation upon various forms of their manifestations in human life, it was believed, the appropriate power would come into the devotee. [Now,] no special deity was worshiped; but it was believed that there was a supreme overall power, which was known by the sum of its individual powers (lordship, protection, and so on)...\" [William Cooper]: A type of pantheism which works its way into the modern mystical societies of today. \"...and that when one had meditated upon them all, and they had become the 'property' of the invocant, he would thenceforward be a man of complete power. [Now, folks,] this kind of idea underlies a good deal of religious and magical thinking in many faiths; though it is seldom put in this as concise a manner. The Enlightened One of the fourth degree was he who could attain, during the rituals, complete identification with this overall power, and was guided by it in all that he did.\" [William Cooper]: It was said that he could communicate directly with the unknown or hidden supervisors. \"[Now,] this meant that, apart from the guidance of the chief, he was free to seek his own pleasure in life. No theological or social bonds limited him. \"It is at this stage, said the Illuminated, that the Arif could perform acts of wonder and magic; influence the physical world, and know the secrets of others. He attained this degree through the acceptance of him by the master, to whom he had confided his dreams and mystical ecstasies. The master alone really knew whether these were true or false experiences, and promoted him accordingly. Some people proceeded to the higher degrees without going through all the lower ones; because they were helped by the spirits of former Illuminates who had died. \"The Master, Emir, Imam and Malik degrees were reserved for the very highest men and women initiates. After the fifth degree the segregation of the sexes in rituals was no longer practiced. Anyone of the degree of Imam and higher could start his own lodge and make his own disciples. \"Bayezid decided to move his headquarters into the most inaccessible mountains of Afghanistan, where he set up a large and luxurious castle; and from which he directed his military and bandit operations, designed to overcome the rest of the East. His missionaries were sent far and wide, but received little official support. The cult did, however, spread among merchants and soldiers who thought that this gave way to mystical experiences was something to enter. They contributed lavishly to the chief’s upkeep and his most expensive military, political and espionage system. \"The heady wine of this success seems to have affected the prudence of the head illuminate more strongly than it should; for his claims became more and more extreme and public [William Cooper: as most usually do]. There was, he now preached, no after ‐ life of the kind currently believed in: no reward or punishment, only a spirit’s stake which was completely different from earthly life. The spirits, if they belonged to the Order, could continue to enjoy themselves in the earthly powers, acting through living members. But that was all. The preaching of this spiritual vampirism seemed to delight his followers as much as it infuriated his enemies, because Bayezid now gave out more and more of the new doctrine based upon his no after ‐ life creed. Eat, drink, be merry. Gain power, look after yourself. You have no allegiance except to the Order, he told them: and all humanity which cannot identify by our secret sign is our lawful prey. The secret signal was to pass a hand over the forehead, palm inwards; the countersign, to hold the ear with the fingers and support the elbow in the cup of their hand.\" [William Cooper]: And you can see that sign being exchanged even today in the courts of law all over the United States of America between lawyers and judges, defendants and judges, prosecutors and judges, prosecutors and defending lawyers, etc, etc, etc. 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"\"Bayezid took to himself the style of Pir ‐ i ‐ Roshan (Sage of Illumination), and founded a city at Hashtnagar, which was to be the center from which Illuminism was to spread all over the world. \"[Now,] each member of his following was given a new name upon entry [William Cooper: Does that sound familiar?]; and this name depended upon the guild to which he in theory belonged. According to Bayezid, all of humanity was divided into professions; his were lamp ‐ makers. Some members were the makers, others sold lamps. Some were known as this kind of lamp, some another. 'Lamp of the Darkness' was the typical example. Among the other guilds noted was those of the Builders [William Cooper: Does that sound familiar?]...soldiers, merchants of various kinds and scribes.\" [William Cooper]: They can be found today in organizations such as the American Medical Association or the American Bar Association, etc., etc. \"Writing in the nineteenth century, an Afghan scholar who was by no means fond of the society of the Roshaniya, claimed that they were in fact an organization devoted to fighting against the tyranny of the Moguls, and that the banditry and strange doctrines attributed to them were untrue allegations by interested parties. He bases this upon two manuscript copies of the objectives of the Order, which seem to have stated that it was dedicated to influencing people of importance throughout the East and West towards greater justice and self ‐ training into the immense capacities of the human mind, whereby wonders can be caused, and through which the harmony of the world will be established. '[Now,] these ideas taken from those enshrined in our ancient literature and practices, as well as those of those of the Persians, many of whom have followed the True Illuminated Path before the New Message was revealed[, they stated].' \"In the end, the Imperial Mogul decided that something must be done about the widespread power of the the militant mystics of the Hindu Kush mountains. The Governor of Kabul arrested Bayezid, clapped him in irons, and paraded him in the streets, to show that here was no supernatural being. To give further point to the proceedings, his hair and beard were half ‐ shaved. But this Governor, Moshin Khan, was under the ascendancy of his religious guide, one Sheik Hatari ‐‐ who may even have been a secret adherent of the Illuminated One. For the cult was spreading with rapidity. In any case, he told the governor that Bayezid was undoubtedly a man of great and holy attainments, and that considerable suffering would inevitably attend anyone who treated this man harshly. Bayezid was allowed to escape. \"The indignities to which he had been subjected candled his Illuminism still higher. Calling his numerous companions, he retired to tribal Tirah, where he set up a military and court atmosphere which is still remembered for its glamor, fervor, and mystery. \"India and Persia were to be overcome by force of arms, he announced. To that end, many more were to be enrolled into the ranks of the Illuminated. Enthusiastic scenes throughout Afghanistan resulted from the proclamation, which was carried far and wide, to the accompaniment of kettle ‐ drums, wild sword ‐ dances. [And] when he was ready Bayezid attended by his halka , or circle of dervishes, led the campaign into the lush land of India. Intercepted by the Moshin Khan whom he had earlier escaped, he was wounded, put to flight, and [he] eventually died as a result of this encounter. \"His son, Omar Ansari, proclaimed himself leader, and immediately ordered an attack upon the Pathan tribe of the Yusufzai who had allied themselves with the Moghul. He was killed by the hillmen, and his own son, 'The Servant of the One', took over the leadership. [And] by the middle of the seventeenth century this youth had been killed defending his castle against a Moghul expeditionary force. His infant son escaped with some of his followers, into Afghanistan proper, where the cult was restarted. The descendants of this Abdul ‐ Qadir (Servant of the Powerful) continued to rule the fanatics, and to send their teachers far and wide. The creed eventually split into two divisions: the military and the religious, and nowadays it is only the followers of the latter [Way] who survived, still a secret cult, which might, given the right conditions, have touched off a movement as important as that of the Assassins. \"[Now,] forty years after the last religio ‐ military leader of the Afghan Illuminated Ones died, a society of the same name (the Illuminati) came into being in Germany, formed, it is said, by Adam Weishaupt, the [young Jesuit priest, a] professor of Canon Law at [the Jesuit] Ingolstadt University. Coincidences of date and beliefs connect these Bavarian Illuminati with the Afghan ones, and also with the other cults which called themselves 'Illuminated'. [William Cooper: In actual fact, they are all the same.] [In] the beginning of the seventeenth century saw the foundation of the Illuminated Ones of Spain ‐‐ the Alumbrados, condemned in an edict of the Grand Inquisition of 1623.\" [William Cooper]: Out of which the condemned Ignatius Loyola emerged as a man, as a man immune to prosecution, arrest, or accusation from any king, prince, or prelate, as the head of one of the most powerful secret societies ever organized, the Society of Jesus, now known as the Jesuits. Ignatius Loyola had been the leader of the Alumbrados in Spain. And it was his sect, the illuminated ones, or the Alumbrados, which became the Society of Jesus. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"\"In 1654, the 'Illuminated' Guerinets came into public notice in France. \"[Now,] documents still extant show several points of resemblance between the German and Central Asian Illuminists: points which are hard to account for on the grounds of pure coincidence, and yet which still might, one supposes, be nothing more than that. The Prophet Mohammed, for example, is claimed as an initiate by the Western Illuminati. Their calendar is the very same which survived in current usage in the former Iranian territories among the Afghans of the time. New Year’s Day with them was the same day as the Persian (and Afghan) Nev Roz festival. Further the degrees of initiation, although seemingly artificial ones coupled with some of the degrees of Freemasonry, were also eight, and there are parallels in the naming of the individual degrees. Like the Roshaniya, the Illuminati stated that they had the objective of gaining important converts for the purpose of improving the state of the world. A comparison of the degrees shows the similarity: \"[In the Roshaniya , the Seeker; and in the Illuminati , the Apprentice.] \"[In the Roshaniya , the Disciple and in the Illuminati , the Fellow ‐ craft.] \"[In the Roshaniya , the Devotee and in the Illuminati , the Master.] \"[In the Roshaniya , the Enlightened One and in the Illuminati , the Illuminatus major.] \"[In the Roshaniya , the Master and in the Illuminati , the Illuminatus dirigens.] \"[In the Roshaniya , the Commander or Emir and in the [ Illuminati , Prince.] \"[In the Roshaniya , Priest and in the Illuminati , Priest.] \"[In the Roshaniya , King or Chief and in the Illuminati , King.] \"[Now,] the early stages of initiation were designed to admit people into the brotherhood to test them for reliability, and possibly to train them for responsible tasks connected with the greater diffusion of knowledge. Even in higher degrees it seems that tests are also applied. Those who were to become priests, for example, were taken to a secret place, where a throne stood, with before it the choice of priestly or royal regalia. The aspirant had to make his choice. Those who opted for the symbols of worldly power were dismissed [promptly]; but candidates taking up the sacred vestments were saluted with the phrase: 'Hail, O Holy One!' The members of this degree were considered teachers, in whose hands was the training of disciples. \"Priests identified themselves with a secret sign: both hands, crossed, were placed flat upon the head. In shaking hands, the priest extended his palm, with the thumb held vertically upwards. The countersign was the fist, with the thumb enclosed within it. \"Princes were those who can influence events at a very high level, either in academic or political affairs. The room in which the initiation to this high and secret degree was celebrated was hung with red; the garments which the prince was to wear were red and white. [Now,] these are, of course, the colors of the Ishmailis as well. In the ritual the candidate is presented as a slave, and states that he wants to liberate society from tyranny. The sign of the degree was the extending of both arms. As the countersign, before taking the hand of another, the prince gripped both his elbows. \"In 1786 a raid upon the house of an influential lawyer, Zwack, reveals secret papers connected with the Order, and it is through these that many of the inner workings of the organization became known. Men were to be influenced through their women folk and a large ‐ scale plan for initiating women members was at an advanced stage of development... \"...It has been widely claimed and touted that many of the charges which were made against the German illuminati were false; and that the possession of instructions, for instance, on forging seals was due to the fact that the lawyer Zwack had a collection devoted to that subject, as a matter of legal interest to him. It is also said that the project of enrolling women and young girls had in actual fact been taken from the aims of a very different society, the Mopses. While this matter still remains open, however, one may as well examine some of the documents which are stated to have belonged to the Society. \"Zwack had written, in his own hand, a document describing the manufacture of a strong ‐ box which would blow up if it were tampered with. He also had a collection of impressions of the seals of several hundred important persons; and the already mentioned data on how to forge or substitute them. These, he stated in a letter of protest, were a part of the [exhibits] of his criminological collection. (laughs) \"The famous memorandum detailing the plan to win over women for the cause comes from papers seized at the home of Baron Bassus, one of the members. The document states that women are the best means of influencing men. They should be enrolled, and into their minds put a hope that they might themselves in time be released from the 'tyranny of public opinion'. Another letter asked how young women can be influenced, since their mothers would not consent to their being placed under the Illuminati for instruction. Five women were suggested by one member, as a start. They were four step ‐ daughters of one of the Illuminati, who were to be placed in the care of the wife of yet another Illuminated One. They, in their turn would, enlarge the society through their friends. It was further mentioned that women are not considered to be really suitable for such an undertaking, because they are 'fickle and impatient'. But the Order was most sorely hit by the fact that something quite discreditable to the character of the founder was discovered; and it was thought that he might be trying to use the organization for personal reasons. 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"\"[Now, the establishment version goes something like this:] Weishaupt, upon the suppression of the Order, refused a pension which he was offered after he had been dismissed from his professorial chair. He attributed his downfall to the machinations of the Jesuits, whom be hated and who had opposed him that as he was not of their number, whereas they considered the university post which he held a long ‐ standing prerogative of their own.\" [William Cooper]: And nothing could be farther from the truth, for Adam Weishaupt was himself a Jesuit priest, holding a professorial chair at a Jesuit university. \"[Now,] he and Zwack were both banished, and little is heard of them thereafter, although there are rumors that they carried on the Society respectably in Saxe ‐ Coburg and the Netherlands.\" [William Cooper]: Another incident that you will not hear in establishment accounts is the story of the messenger writing from one Bavarian illuminati lodge to another, who was literally struck by lightning ‐‐ divine intervention, if you will. Struck dead from his horse, in his pouch carrying the papers of a secret plan to take over individual nations, and ultimately the world, were put into the hands of the Bavarian government and many of the portions of these papers are almost word for word what later became known as the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion. [William Cooper]: We've got to take a short break, folks. Don't go away. We'll be right back after this short pause. (break music: Unknown harpsichord music, then unknown pipe organ music) [continuing reading from A History of Secret Societies , written by Arkon Daraul]: \"Illuminism had spread to France, however, some years before its suppression in Germany. Influential personages were members, many drawn from the ranks of the important Masons of Paris. As in the case of the German branch, it was soon alleged that they pursued terrible aims and practiced frightful orgies. An extract from a French book (almost certainly grossly exaggerated) of the seventeen ‐ nineties ‐‐ La Secte des Illuminés ‐‐ will give a fair idea of this: \"'The huge château of Ermenonville near Paris was one of the chief lodges of the Illuminated. It belonged to the Marquis of Gerardin, who protected Rousseau and later gave him a tomb on his estate. St. Germain, the notable impostor, presided over it. He claims to be a thousand years old, and to be able to make gold. He was said to be immortal, but [(laughs) strangely] died in 1784.\" [William Cooper]: And even today, some Looney Tunes wackos claim that they converse with St. Germaine, who still alive walking around in a modern ‐ day suit and tie. \"[Well,] on the day of his initiation [at the Château of Ermenonville], the candidate was conducted through a long, dark passage into an immense hall draped with black. [There were]...faint...lamps [sat around the room]...[There were men dressed as] corpses in...shrouds. [There was an] altar...of human skeletons, [which] stood in the center [of the large hall. And, in the flickering, low lamplight, the priest conducting the initiation resembled] ghostly forms [moving] through the hall[. And everywhere there was the stench of some terrible] odor. [Two men], dressed as specters, [always] appeared and tied a pink band or ribbon [which was] smeared with blood around [the] forehead [of the candidate]. Upon this was an image of the lady of Loretto. [William Cooper: Does this sound familiar, ladies and gentlemen?] A crucifix was placed in his hand, and an amulet hung around his neck.\" [William Cooper]: He was asked to remove his clothes; and if he showed any hesitancy, his clothes were removed for him. \"...and laid upon a funeral pyre[. Crosses of blood] were smeared [upon his body and his genitalia] were tied in [a ribbon] or [with] string. \"[Then,]...frightening figures, [covered with blood] and mumbling [strange incantations], approached and threw themselves down in prayer. After [a long period of time,]...weeping[, crying, wailing broke out as if a herd, a plethora of mourners were bereaved upon the death of their closest and deepest love]...the funeral pyre [burned brighter and brighter. All the] clothes [of the initiate] were consumed. [And] from[, behind or near this] fire, [one of the priests emerged almost as if he had taken form from the smoke of the pyre itself. And] the five...figures went into...convulsions [and loud wailing and screaming took place. And then] came the voice of [someone concealed behind a curtain]...these oaths, which the candidate had to repeat: \"'In the name of the crucified one, I swear to sever all bonds which unite me with mother, brothers, sisters, wife, relatives, friends, 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"mistress, kings, superiors, benefactors or any other man to whom I have promised faith, service, or obedience; \"'I name the place in which I was born. Henceforth I live in another dimension, which I will not reach until I have renounced the evil globe which has been cursed by Heaven; \"'From now onwards I shall reveal to my new chief all that I have heard or found out; and I shall also seek out and observe things which might otherwise have escaped me; \"'I honor the aqua toffana ; it is a quick and essential medium of removing from the earth, through death or robbing them of their wits, of those who oppose truth, and those who try to take it from our hands; \"'I shall avoid Spain, Naples, and all other accursed lands, and I shall avoid the temptation to betray what I have now heard; \"'Lightning will not strike as rapidly as the dagger, which will reach me, wherever I may be, should I betray my initiation.\" \"[Then, a seven ‐ branched ]candelabrum, bearing seven black candles, [was] placed before the candidate, and [a large] bowl containing human blood. [The candidate washed] himself in the blood, and [drank] a quantity of it. The string around his [genitalia was] removed, [and then he was carried to] a bath to undergo complete ablution. After this, he [was given] a meal composed of root vegetables.' \"[Now, folks, (laughs)] while it is possible that such ceremonies as this have actually taken place...\" [William Cooper]: And we know that they have, because it is exact...the exact ceremony that George Bush underwent in the crypt, or what is known as the tomb, or the skull and bones at Yale University... \"...[that] it will be recalled that such items as 'human blood' are generally not of the genuine variety in any society other than those reputed to be dedicated to criminal or perverted ends.\" [William Cooper]: Well, I have this to say: no one knows but those who actually take part in the ceremony, whether it's chicken blood or human blood or pig blood or cow’s blood. \"[And, as it is] with the initiations of other societies, there is no doubt that the candidate may have been made to believe that he was actually going through an initiation which involved horrible things of this nature [such as human blood]. Initiation into the ancient mysteries was often accompanied by the exposure of the candidate to fear [another] emotions, in order to make [him] receptive to the oath or message which was to be made manifest. \"It has been said[, folks] that the European version of the Order of the Illuminati contributed in no small measure to the development of revolutionary doctrines which eventually culminated in the Russian and other Communist machines.\" [William Cooper]: And in fact, those of serious study, who have perused the depths of the available material as I and others have, have no doubt, have no doubt whatsoever that Communism ‐‐ international Socialism ‐‐ is the direct product of the Mystery Schools of the Illuminati, as was the formation of this nation which was guaranteed to lead us in to what is known as the New World Order ‐‐ Novus Ordo Seclorum: the formation of a one world totalitarian state ruled by benevolent \"despotism,\" is the way that they put it. \"[And] there is little doubt that the Order was dedicated to the overcoming of princely power as it was then known, and to the diffusion of anti ‐ religious ideas. [And] this can best be seen by examining the development of the teaching of the member, as he progressed from one degree of initiation into the next. \"[Now, folks,] many young enthusiasts with a taste for mystery and a desire to fight oppression in any form were drawn, through a deliberate plan, from the ranks of [all of the colleges and universities and from all of the other supposedly benevolent fraternital organizations]. After an oath of obedience and silence [had] been extracted from the candidate, he was then handed over to a Director [or Teacher, or, if you will, Hierophant], to be taught that the Order was one of the discipline and effort, and that the final objectives were to do good through leaving aside all preconceived notions and upon the basis of free thought to lead mankind to salvation.\" [William Cooper]: But salvation granted by who, and salvation from what? That is the question that intelligent men should be asking. However, it's been my experience that most men and most women don't ask any questions whatsoever ‐‐ or very few, anyway. \"Those who managed to show that they were likely to accept the next stage in teaching, were advanced to the rank in which he was made to swear that he would work under the orders of his masters without doubt or question. He would not use his critical faculties in any way in any matter connected with such instructions. 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"\"[Now,] in the lower ranks ‐‐ [or] (laughs) the 'nursery'...\" [William Cooper]: For all of you Blue Lodge Master Masons out there who think you know so much, that are nothing more than the greatest group of followers that ever conceived and let loose upon humanity. \"[Yes, in the 'nursery'] ‐‐ the member was very much in the dark as to the way in which the Order was run, and how it should accomplish its design of freeing the world. As he progressed, however, he found that part of his service to the Society was to gain financial and social power, and to place them at the disposal of the group. [Indeed,] he was expected to be a diligent Mason, and to try to gain control over [Freemason] funds. It was not until the tenth rite of promotion had been completed that the member [was] given ‐‐ with the grade of Priest ‐‐ certain definite knowledge.\" [William Cooper]: And now, today, in the order known as the Scottish Rite, this information is not given until the candidate actually reaches the 30th degree, according to the actual writings of the man who was the Grand Commander of all of Freemasonry of the world and of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in the United States, Mr. Pike. General Pike. \"[Well, this knowledge] included the fact that the Illuminati were proposing to destroy princes and prelates throughout the world, and were to remove forever the feeling of local nationality from the minds of men. [William Cooper: Another goal was to destroy all existing religions.] The ways in which this was to be done involved infiltrating high positions in education, administration[, of government, the military and, of course,] the Press. \"The very highest degrees showed that the rationalism and materialism of the thinkers who developed it were determined to stamp out all belief in religion. God and any faith in a deity, the initiate was told, were human inventions, and [they] had no real meaning [whatsoever]. [Now,] this was developed further, and the member who arrived at the highest position [in the Order, or (that [designated as] Rex [or] King) learned that he was now the same as any king, [on the same level, with the same rights and the same divine right of rule,] and that all men were capable of equal advancement [but all men were not equal]: hence the need for kings over [man] was an illusion [perpetrated by those in power, and this perpetration was to be broken at all costs]. [William Cooper]: And the highest, for the men who sat at the head of the Council, the Council of hidden supervisors made up of nine members was designated as Rex Mundi, or literally translated, \"Kings of the World.\" In their machinations to overthrow, topple the Kings and Queens of all the countries of the world from their thrones, they established the United States of America and the English colonies in the New World. And its ultimate goal ‐‐ its secret destiny ‐‐ was to be the catalyst to bring into the world what they called the Great Society or the New World Order. And it certainly worked, dear listeners. As you can look back through history, the granting of the common man of liberty, fraternity, equality, freedom that he had never tasted or known before in history, lit the spark that then ignited the French Revolution ‐‐ of course, with the leadership and the manipulation of the people of the Illuminati, the lodges of Freemasonry, the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross and others ‐‐ the highest level were all the same with the same goals. And this spark of revolution spread throughout the world. And, until we all grow up and learn how to stop this, it will continue. [William Cooper]: As the secret societies propel us, manipulate us, deceive us, lie, operating in secret, infiltrating everything decent and good that man has ever built, destroying it from within, bringing closer and closer their goal of what they believe will be a Utopia on earth: a one ‐ world, totalitarian, Socialist order. They hope to create the world where they will rule as being the ones who possess the only truly mature minds; they will establish a council of advisors to a world, charismatic, political and religious leader who will be the outward rule, but he will really take his orders from this \"benevolent despotism,\" this Council of Learned Elders; and everyone on the face of this earth will be in total control for every 24 ‐ hour period of their lives. There will be one ‐ world religion catering to the needs of man ‐‐ not men obeying the laws of any God. The general rule will be, as has been touted many, many times by these people: \"Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.\" And even murder will be considered to be a learning experience provided that the perpetrator actually learns something. People who exhibit violent tendencies as a matter of normal behavior on their part will simply be eliminated. [William Cooper]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope this is beginning to come together and make sense to you, if it doesn't as yet. We have a long, long, way to go as you have probably already begun to understand. [William Cooper asks for air ‐ time donations] Good night, and God bless each and every one of you.

(opening music: Stars Fell On Alabama , music by Frank Perkins, lyrics by Mitchell Parish, sung by Billie Holiday) Oh, what a great lady! Anyone, anyone who ever, ever comes to me and tells me that music doesn't penetrate directly to the soul, doesn't have a soul. I mean, that's the only interpretation I could ever make to any statement like that made by anyone. Tonight, folks, we've got to get you back into the stream. Now, the way I do that is I quit telling you about my research and I quote exactly from the horse's mouth, so you'll know that what you're hearing on this program, the Hour of the Time, is not being made up by me or anyone else. And it's there for anyone to find if you'll just get off your butts and go to the libraries, start digging and looking and searching and reading. And quit listening to what you're told, including what you're told on this show. Remember, my admonition is not to ever believe anything you hear from the mouth of anyone, or that you read from the book written by anyone, or from Dan Rather and the six o'clock news, or the President of the United States, Archer Carter, Tom Valentine, Rush Limbaugh (the man who's sitting on half of his brain) or indeed, from even your own mother. For, folks, the deception in this world right now that's being promulgated in order to bring about a one ‐ world, totalitarian, Socialist government is so deep that you better be standing on a stump or you might drown. Alice Bailey, folks, one of the key members of the New Age religion, wrote this: \"There is no question, therefore, that the work to be done in familiarizing the general public with the nature of the Mysteries is of paramount importance at this time. These Mysteries will be restored to outer expression through the medium of the Church and the Masonic Fraternity.” And she's absolutely, one hundred percent, correct. The question of just what the ancient mysteries were, folks, was answered in part by Albert G. Mackey, another 33rd degree Mason. He wrote a two ‐ volume work, entitled Encyclopedia of Freemasonry , and wrote this under the subject of the Ancient Mysteries: \"Each of the pagan gods had (besides the public and open) a secret worship paid [to] him, to which none were admitted but those who had been selected by preparatory ceremonies, called initiation. This secret worship was termed the Mysteries.\" The student of the Masonic order can know that, when Mr. Mackey writes, his writings can be relied upon. He is considered to be one of the premiere Masonic authors of all ‐ time. These are the comments from the biographical information presented on Mr. Mackey in front of his encyclopedia: \"His writings are universally esteemed for their sincerity, honest records and common sense. He was a leader in research who valued accuracy.\" Carl Claudy, another Mason who writes on the subject of the Lodge, also has words of praise for Mr. Mackey: \"He was one of the greatest students and most widely followed authorities the Masonic world has ever known.\" And in his book, entitled Introduction to Freemasonry , he praised Mr. Mackey with these words: \"Albert Gallatin Mackey: one of the greatest students and most widely followed authorities the Masonic world has known...He is the great master of Freemasonry.\" So, Mr. Mackey certainly can be believed when he tells his readers that the worship of pagan gods had a secret, non ‐ visible worship beside the public one. The reader can believe him when he identifies the name of this secret worship. He told his readers, \"This secret worship was termed, 'The Mysteries'.\" Another who was written on the subject on the ancient Mysteries was Manly P. Hall, another 33rd degree Mason whom I have quoted extensively before in this series. He has written in his book, entitled What the Ancient Wisdom Expects of Its Disciples : \"In the remote past the gods walked with men and they chose from among the sons of men the wisest and the truest. With these specially ordained and illumined sons they left the keys of their great wisdom, which was the knowledge of good and evil...These illumined ones founded what we know as the Ancient Mysteries.\" 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Now, in case you weren't listening there, this is a dead giveaway and an admission that the gods that walked with men were known (at least in the Bible) as Satan.

If the word 'sheeple' apply to you makes you angry [sic], then folks, it is an indication that it fits you like a shoe, like a glove, that you are indeed one of the sheeple. Let me read it again: \"With these specially ordained and illumined sons they left the keys of their great wisdom, which was the knowledge of good and evil.\" According to the Bible, the knowledge of good and evil was imparted to Adam when Satan enticed Eve to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge and she, in turn, enticed Adam. And what was the fruit of the tree of knowledge? It was the knowledge of good and evil. It was forbidden for man to know that. Now, I'm not making judgment on any of this, I'm just telling you what my research says. Remember, this is not a religious program. And while I, myself, personally, have my own idea of what my own religion is, I am in no means trying to foist it off on anyone else. Let me continue. He wrote ‐‐ and we're talking about Manly P. Hall, 33rd degree Freemason ‐‐ he wrote additional comments about these Mysteries in another of the books he was written, called The Secret Teachings of All Ages . And I would urge you, if you can afford it, to buy that book. It's a very expensive book. I have a copy of it in my library. It cost me one hundred and fifty dollars, and it was worth every single penny of it, I can assure you. \"The arcana [William Cooper: defined as being a secret or hidden knowledge] of the ancient Mysteries were never revealed to the profane [William Cooper: defined as those not initiated into the inner Mysteries] except through the media of symbols.\" You're going to find, folks, that symbols mean more than you will ever begin to understand, unless you waded deep into the end of the stream that is Mystery Babylon, as I have. \"Symbolism fulfilled the dual office of concealing the sacred truths from the uninitiated and revealing to those qualified to understand the symbols.\" Mr. Hall dedicated the latter book to \"the proposition that, concealed within the emblematic figures, allegories and rituals of the ancients is a secret doctrine concerning the inner Mysteries of life, which doctrine has been preserved in toto [which means, 'in the whole'] among a small band of initiated minds since the [very] beginning of the world.\" He went on to mention that the Mysteries \"were secret societies, binding their initiates to inviolable secrecy, and avenging with death the betrayal of their sacred trusts.\" And to this day they take blood oaths. Mr. Hall told the reader that no one is to know the identity of those who have received the secrets. In fact, he wrote: \"The true Adept and initiate shall reveal his identity to no man unless that one is worthy to receive it.\" He further explained where some of these initiates lived when he wrote: \"No reasonable doubt can exist that the initiates of Greece, Egypt, and other ancient countries possessed the correct solutions to those great cultural, intellectual, moral and social problems which, in an unsolved state, confront the humanity of the 20th century.\" He further amplified that thought he had with this: \"Neo ‐ Platonism [defined by Mr. Hall as a school founded by Plotinus around 240 A.D. concerning itself with the problems of metaphysics which he calls 'the study of knowledge'] recognized the existence of a secret and all ‐ important doctrine which from the time of the earliest civilizations had been concealed within the rituals, symbols, and allegories of religions and philosophies.\" So, in summary, it is possible, folks, to understand what these ancient Mysteries were. And there appears to be at least four truths gleaned from the information provided in the comments made previously and these truths appears to be: 1. The ancient Mysteries had two forms of worshiping the same god. 2. The knowledge of the true god was reserved for those who had been entrusted with the secrets, and not for those whom they call the 'profane'. 3. Those who understood those secrets were sworn to the strictest secrecy, and 4. Those who have knowledge of the secrets claimed to possess all of the answers to all of the problems of mankind. Now, there was an additional secret for the secret ‐ bearers. They had to be initiated in a private initiation ceremony. Albert Pike, General Albert Pike, a southern Confederate General during the Civil War, wrote this: \"Initiation was considered to be a mystical death, and the perfect Epopt was [then] said to be regenerated, new ‐ born , restored to a renovated existence of life, light , and purity .\" In fact, folks, this \"new ‐ born\" experience is similar to the experience the \"born ‐ again\" Christians go through. The Christians call their experience a second ‐ birth, just as the Masons do. In fact, Albert Pike calls a similar ceremony a \"born ‐ again\" experience, and he wrote this: \"In the Indian Mysteries, the third degree, the Initiate is said to be born ‐ again.\" The ceremony in the ancient Mysteries has been described by the Masonic writer Manly P. Hall: \"In the ancient system of initiation, the truth seeker must pass through a second birth, and those who attained this exalted state were known thereafter as 'the twice born'. This 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"new birth must be personally earned through a complete regeneration of character and conduct.\" This new ‐ birth ceremony involves a symbolic death according to the Mason Kenneth MacKenzie. And he wrote this: \"In the ancient Mysteries, the aspirant could not participate in the highest secrets until he had been placed in the coffin. In this, he was symbolically said to die and his resurrection was to the light.\" Now, remember I told you about the initiation that George Bush underwent in the crypt, also known as the tomb, the Skull and Bones, the Brotherhood of Death at Yale University? This is what they're talking about. During a press conference, a reporter asked George Bush if he was a Christian and he replied thusly: \"If you're asking if I have been born ‐ again, the answer is yes.\" And indeed, he has. Modern ‐ day Masons participate in an almost similar ceremony to the one described by these Masonic writers. In the third degree called the Master Mason degree, inside the blue lodge the candidate is actually knocked off of his feet by several of the Masons in attendance. He is wrapped up in a blanket and moved to the western end of the temple. There, after further ceremony, he is raised up by a grip called \"the Master's Grip\" or the \"Grip of the Lion's Paw\". Those who learned the Mysteries also learned that they had a secret project, one that was described by Albert Pike in his book, entitled Morals and Dogma . Mr. Pike wrote this, \"Behold [our] object, the end, the result of the great speculations...of antiquity; the ultimate annihilation of evil, and restoration of Man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Masayah, a Christos, the incarnate Word, Reason, or Power of Deity.\" I urge you all, if you could find a copy of Morals and Dogma by Albert Pike, to purchase it, take it home and read it. Mr. Hall told his readers that those who had been initiated into the Mysteries were the secret power behind the governments of the past. He wrote this about these ancient initiates in his book, entitled What the Ancient Wisdom Expects of Its Disciples : \"They are the invisible powers behind the thrones of earth, and men are but marionettes, dancing while the invisible ones pull the strings. We see the dancer, but the master mind that does the work remains concealed by the cloak of silence.” Now remember, I told you, folks, that if you don't open your mind, and if you don't quit believing dogma, if you don't quit believing what people tell you, if you don't stop believing what Dan Rather tells you on the six o'clock news, or your local minister down at your church, or your mother or the President of the United States, and if you don't start digging to find the truth yourself, you, you, the sheeple, are the marionettes, dancing while the invisible ones pull the strings. And until you change that pattern of your life, you will always be the puppet on the end of someone else's string. And I know that that's not what you want to be, is it? Well, if it's not, change your life now. Stop believing what you are told, including what you hear on this show unless it checks out in your own research, your own experience, your own digging. Each of us must find our own truth, and if we are really looking and digging, we're ultimately going to come to something near the same truth for all of us. And I can tell you now that most of us have been living in fantasyland for all of our lives. We don't even know anything near what the truth of any matter is. And we must begin an honest search, starting from the beginning, wiping the slate clean, cleansing our mind, and looking at the world, beginning again as though through the eyes of a new ‐ born child. And you will find that most of what you ever been taught in your entire life is a lie...is a lie. Other writers, folks, have confirmed the thoughts of Mr. Hall. A Masonic scholar named George Steinmetz also acknowledged that these Mysteries exist, and that some of the members inside the Masonic lodges are custodians of the secrets. He has written this in his book, entitled Freemasonry: Its Hidden Meaning : \"Ancient secret doctrine, which is concealed in Masonic allegory and symbolism...it was but to preserve these truths for future generation that Masonry itself was perpetuated.\" And if that is true, why is it a secret? Why not tell us all what this secret doctrine is, for modern man is not like ancient man when he didn't know how to read or reason or understand? Modern man has the capability to understand anything that is put before him and accept it if it is the truth, and reject it if it is a lie. So why the secrecy? The secrecy is because, folks, the real secret of Mystery Babylon is how to control everyone else. And if they reveal these secrets, they won't have the control, for it will be in the hands of everyone. That is the greatest secret of the secret societies. Another writing of Manly P. Hall was this: \"Much of the ritualism of Freemasonry is based upon the trials to which candidates were subjected to by the ancient hierophants [William Cooper: 'hierophant' is defined as the high priest of the Mysteries] before the keys of wisdom were [enthroned] to them.\" The ancient Mysteries had a beginning. According to Mr. Mackey, he wrote about where they started: \"The first of which are those of Isis and Osiris in Egypt, the most important of these Mysteries were the Osiric in Egypt.\" Another writer, Edmond Ronayne, an ex ‐ Mason, confirmed that the Masons were involved in the worship of Osiris when he wrote this in his book, entitled The Master's Carpet : \"Masonry's ceremonies, symbols and the celebrated legend of Hiram in the Master Mason's degree, were directly borrowed from the 'Ancient Mysteries,' or the secret worship of Baal, Osiris or Tammuz.\" This is a direct admission that Freemasonry stems directly out of Mystery Babylon, the ancient Mystery Religion, the worship of Baal, the golden calf representative of the house during which that two thousand ‐ year period the Sun resided. The Sun, the symbol of the Light, Lucifer, the intellect, the gift, primordial knowing. Albert Pike then detailed where the Mysteries went after their beginnings in Egypt. He wrote this in Morals and Dogma : \"From Egypt, the Mysteries went to Phoenicia, and were celebrated at Tyre. Osiris changed his name, and become Adoni or Dionusos, still the representative of the Sun... In Greece and Sicily, Osiris took the name of Bacchus.\" So the ancient Mysteries concealed an important 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Mystery, kept secret from the average person. The mystics claim that this Mystery has been concealed from the world for centuries. Even though they had taken the Mystery to other continents, those who believed in this religion were yet to take it to America. That was yet to come, and we will get to that, I promise you. And it will, I also promise you, amaze you. [Gilbert] Lafayette, who was a very famous and noted pirate and a member of Freemasonry and the Knights Templar, said this: \"An invisible hand is guiding the populace.\" Arthur Edward Waite, a prolific writer on secret societies has written this: \"Beneath the broad tide of human history, there flow the stealthy undercurrents of the secret societies, which frequently determine in the depths the changes that take place upon the surface.\" Another who wrote about the power just underneath the surface was President Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States of America, who made this startling statement. He made this statement, yet it was ignored, but it should never go ignored from this point forward. \"There is a power so organized, so subtle, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\" So, these two writers have warned America that secret societies had been arranging the major events of the past, and President Wilson warned those who were quick to condemn these organizations that they had better be cautious. Albert Pike had also connected the secret societies with a secret belief in his book, entitled Morals and Dogma . He wrote that all secret orders and associations, quote ‐‐ now remember, he said, all...all secret orders and associations \"had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the masters, the other, public.\" Now, one such secret society with two doctrines was the Illuminati, and Professor [Adam] Weishaupt, its founder, boasted of his organization's secrecy. He realized that this secrecy would enable them to decide the fate of nations, and because their deliberations were secret, no outsider could interfere. He wrote this: \"The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment; let it never appear...in its own name, but always [covered] by another name, and another occupation.\" Weishaupt later wrote about that secrecy in a letter to a fellow member of the Illuminati, \"Nothing can bring this about but hidden societies. Hidden schools of wisdom are the means which will one day free men from their bonds...Princes and nations shall vanish from the earth.\" Folks, don't go away. We've got to stop for a break. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: When You Wish Upon A Star , performed by Wynton Marsalis from the album, Hot House Flowers ) Don't forget, folks, this Monday night, March 15th, 8pm to 11, I'll be at the Lafayette Hotel, 2223 El Cajon Blvd in San Diego, California. That's this coming Monday night, March 15th at 8pm 'til 11. I'll be at the Lafayette Hotel at 2223 El Cajon Blvd in San Diego, California. I'll be giving a three ‐ hour presentation, entitled The Sacrificed King . This is on the Kennedy assassination and I'm going to footage there that you've never seen before. I'm going to show you the direct, I mean direct, absolute occult connection to the Kennedy assassination, I'm going to tell what group killed our president, murdered our president if you will. I'm going to show you the footage of what Dealey Plaza really is so you'll see that this is not just an innocent park in the city of Dallas. I'm going to show you where Dallas really is, and what the occult significance of its location means. And when you leave there, folks, you're going to understand more about the workings of the world, and who assassinated our president and why then you'll ever have before. You're also going to see that, uh, Oliver Stone knew all of this and chose to deceive the American people, because he is one of those who are bringing about the New World Order. And his movie, JFK , was designed to convince all of us that our government doesn't work. The Constitutional government can't work, that it's turned against us, and it's not true, folks. Our Constitutionally instituted and established government had absolutely nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination, as all of those who show up on Monday night, March 15th, 8pm will find out. [William Cooper further plugs the appearance and offers CAJI memberships] Well, folks, you've heard all through this series of broadcasts about a group of men supposedly with the only truly mature minds in this world, who are going to setup a Utopia on earth, a heaven of earth if you will. And that there's the ones who are going to rule through a benevolent despotism. And they call this Utopia the Great Society, the New World Order, the Utopian philosophy, all of these things. Now, Lyndon Johnson, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a member of this secret society. He was, in fact, a 33rd degree Freemason, and his Great Society that he envisioned was exactly what we're talking about here. And you can see that Johnson, a great Socialist, a Marxist secretly, set us on the road to Socialism by setting up this great welfare state, which he called the Great Society. It's one and the same, folks. It's the same. George Bush's New World Order is the same. The New World Order that our forefathers envisioned was the same. The Great Society talked about during the Peasants' Revolt in England was the same. The same that is coming, unless we wake up to stop it. And you can see, by the welfare state, how well it really works. (laughs) It doesn't work at all, it never will work, it can't work! These people are Looney Tunes. If you believe the exoteric version of what they intend to bring about ‐‐ you see, they have no intention of bring about a Utopia, a heaven on earth, a Great Society, not at all. That's to lure the unwary, the foolish, the great mass of followers that make up the lower degrees of this secret society so that they will support the completion of the Great Work, the plan. They really intend us to be something along the lines of what Hitler attempted to establish. They talk about in terms of a great cleansing, where certain religions, certain 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"people, certain races, will literally be eliminated from this earth. And they are convicted through their own words, ladies and gentlemen, as you hearing tonight and you've heard in other broadcasts. For when I feel that you are getting to the point where you're not understanding what's happening, I go back as I'm doing tonight and quote these people directly from their own mouths. I'm going to do that again tomorrow night, folks, so be ready. Let me continue. The secret societies were created to bring the world to the new society known as the New World Order. The members of these organizations obviously feel that their goals are so noble that they may perform whatever tasks are required to bring them to that goal, and that goal to fruition. This means, folks, that murder, plunder and lying all become acceptable as long as these methods assist its members in obtaining their goal. But the Freemasons, or frère ‐ maçon , as the true term began, want to world to know that they are not one of the societies involved in changing the world's civilization, and they're quick to rush to their own defense. However, when you go back and read their own history and their own words, you can see that they have literally no defense, for they are convicted by the words of their leaders. By the words of their leaders. And folks, by their deeds. For it was General Albert Pike who created, through the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. It was the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry that created the branch known as B'nai B'rith, which then created the ADL, or the Anti ‐ Defamation League, which is nothing but an organization of criminals who have murdered, who have bombed, who have lied, and just recently, one of their crimes was spying. Putting spies within police organizations in the United States of America, and spiriting out files and records. And all of Jews in the United States support this criminal organization to their great shame, and those of you who feel that the Jews are responsible for all of this, you are wrong. Most Jews don't know any more about this then you did, and they are being used, just as you are being used. Just as I have been used in my life. \"In all time, truth has been hidden under symbols,\" wrote Albert Pike. And he also wrote this, \"[Symbols] are nevertheless, ingenious veils that cover the Truth.\" Now, Albert Pike was the Sovereign Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. The Scottish Rite now controls world Freemasonry. There certainly seems, folks, to be a power in knowing something that you can't tell your family, friends, children, or business acquaintances. And Adam Weishaupt said it best with this selection from his writings: \"Of all the means I know to lead men, the most effectual is a concealed mystery.\" And that is true, I've found in my research, that the vast fools, the followers flock to the Mysteries and the promise of learning some secret during their climb up the ladder of degrees of initiation. The truth is that only a very few ever learn anything, and what they learn is how to control the rest. The power of hidden symbols was alluded to by another writer, this time Foster Bailey in his book, entitled The Spirit of Freemasonry : \"A symbol veils or hides a secret, and it is that which veils certain mysterious forces. These energies when released can have a potent effect.\" And indeed they can, as we are all feeling now the [pinch?] of the power. There are many who can attest to that simple truth. Organizations with concealed or secret initiation ceremonies abound in America and, indeed, around the world. College fraternities and sororities teach the college student to accept secret initiation ceremonies and hidden knowledge at a young age. The Masons, intended for adult males, have similar organizations for their young sons and daughters, and other secret organizations for their wives. And all of these organizations tend to prepare their male members for further service in the master secret organization, the Masons. However, the Masons are quick to point out that they conceal their truths from the general public. Manly P. Hall, for instance, wrote this: \"It is for the Adepts,\" and 'adept' is defined by the dictionary as one who is an expert, but there is an esoteric definition that shall be discussed later. \"It is for the Adepts, one to understand the meaning of the symbols.\" He further instructed his readers that understanding the symbols can make one wise \"and understanding these symbols is the beginning of wisdom.\" Max Toth, a writer about the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, also wrote about the purpose of symbols, and he said, \"The knowledge of the ancient mysteries was never revealed to the laymen except through the media of symbols. Symbolism fulfilled both the need to conceal sacred truths from the uninitiated and to offer a language for those qualified to understand it.\" Now, whatever these secrets are, folks, one writer on the subject feels it's time to make them public. Alice Bailey, one of the key writers supporting the New Age movement, wrote this: \"The hour for the ancient mysteries has arrived. These Ancient Mysteries were hidden in numbers, in ritual, in words, and in symbology; these veil the secret.\" Another writer who writes of the order, Carl H. Claudy, told anyone who read the Masonic literature that he had best understand the language or they would miss the true meaning of the words. He wrote, \"He who hears but the words of Freemasonry misses their meaning entirely.\" Rex Hutchins, a 32rd degree Mason who has written a book for the Masons, one so important that it was used to replace one written by Henry Clausen, a former Sovereign Commander, also informed his readers that his writings also concealed a secret. \"The word 'reveal' means to re ‐ veil, that is, to give one explanation and yet to continue to maintain the mystery of the symbol by not explaining it in a full and complete manner.\" 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"So, the language code must be broken if one is to learn the truth about the Masonic order. The reason that is so is because the Masons have admitted that they have concealed the true meaning of some of their language. However, it is possible, folks, to know the true meanings of at least some of the hidden language, and the listener can be certain that the discovered interpretations are correct, because the Masons themselves have revealed the hidden meanings of some of their symbols in some of their own literature. The secret societies, folks, that have concealed their purposes and hidden meanings, concealed writings, and private initiation ceremonies are, admittedly, very powerful. One who recognized that power was Benjamin Disraeli, the prime minister of England in the late 1880s, who said this in the House of Commons on July 14th in 1856: \"There is in Italy a power which we seldom mention in this House...I mean the secret societies...It is useless to deny, because it is impossible to conceal, that a great part of Europe ‐‐ the whole of Italy and France and a great portion of Germany, to say nothing of other countries ‐‐ is covered with a network of these secret societies.\" What are their objects [sic]? \"They do not want Constitutional government; they want to change the tenure of the land, to drive out the present owners of the soil and to put an end to ecclesiastical establishments [meaning religion].\" The Masons know about concealing secrets from the rest of the world. Carl Claudy, a Masonic writer, told his readers that secrets are inside secrets, which are inside other secrets, and he wrote this: \"[Cut] through the outer shell and find a meaning; cut through that meaning and find another; under it if you dig [deep] enough you may find a third, a fourth ‐ who shall say how many teachings?\" And even the Communists used concealment, for the Communists were created by the Mysteries. The cell system of the Communist party was created by the Mystery Schools, which have used the same system for millennia. Nikolai Lenin, the Marxist Communist who communized the Russian nation in the years following the Russian revolution of 1917 wrote this: \"We have to use any ruse, dodge, trick, cunning, unlawful method, concealment and veiling of the truth.\" Many of the signs for identifying a Communist, or a member of the Communist party, are exactly the same as those symbols and signs used by Freemasons to identify each other. The use of secrecy to conceal thoughts from certain of the members [sic] of an organization or from the public is the device of those who have something to hide. That something is so horrible, so terrible, that knowledge of that secret must be kept from those who would have the most to lose by knowledge of that secret. In the case of the secret societies, it is a belief in Lucifer, also known as Satan, or the devil. In the case of Communism, it is the truth that the people living in a Communist nation know that the system does not work. But those in a non ‐ Communist nation, targeted for a Communist government, are not to learn that simple truth. They're to be told that the system is the culmination of man's upward search for a perfect society. A Great Society, if you will, a Utopia on earth, and they must be deluded into believe that there is no cost in the change from their current form of government to the communist form. One of the things that I find so incredible is that they trap the intellectuals so easily. The intellectuals, the ones who are supposedly so good at using their brain, cannot even use their brain so much as to look into history to see that the first people that the Communists, the international Socialists, destroyed, killed, sentenced to the labor camps, the gulag if you will, are always the intellectuals. And history has recorded the brutality of the Communists, and the fact that millions of people have had to die as the Communists installed that form of government. The evidence to support that convention will be discussed later in some other program. Now, secrecy is certainly not a part of the Christian religion today, although the Christian religion began in secret and was, in fact, a secret society. It is possible to know that nothing Jesus has said has been hidden from the Christians of today. He told the high priest in [the book of] John, chapter 18, verse 20: \"And in secret have I said nothing.\" The intentional concealing of an organization beliefs and purposes through the use of hidden language and concealed symbols is reserved primarily to the secret societies, and the nationwide Masonic lodges are indeed a secret society. And in the beginning, Christians had their secret symbols also. One of the most prominent was the symbol of the fish. The secret is simply the fact that certain of their members [sic] worshiped Lucifer, and that they keep that secret from the overwhelming majority of their own members, and certainly the public is never to know this fact if they can help it. And the evidence to support that conclusion is ample, but only to one who cares enough to look for it. The problem with most people is that they don't care enough to look for anything except Wheel of Fortune on the television set. [reading from The New World Order , written by A. Ralph Epperson]: \"So, the student of history has to discover the hidden meanings behind the symbols and the Masonic literature and in the secret initiation ceremonies to understand the Masonic Order. \"One of the first symbols that needs to be examined is the symbol of the serpent, also called a snake or dragon. 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"\"Manly P. Hall wrote that the use of this symbol is as old as early man when he wrote this in his book, entitled The Secret Teachings of All Ages : 'Among nearly all these ancient peoples the serpent was accepted as a symbol of wisdom...'\" [William Cooper]: For from the serpent has man received the gift of intellect. \"Here Mr. Hall states that the serpent is the symbol of 'wisdom.' It will be remembered that Lord Maitreya, the future New Age leader, also oclaimed to possess 'wisdom.' Mr. Hall continued: \"'Serpent worship in some form has permeated nearly all parts of the earth. The serpent is the symbol and prototype of the Universal Savior, who redeems the world by giving creation the knowledge of itself and the realization of good and evil.'\" [William Cooper]: An admission that the serpent, at least from the point of view of the Christian Bible, is Satan. \"And then Mr. Hall links the serpent with the Ancient Mysteries previously discussed. He continues with the comment that the serpent was worshiped by the priests of that religion: \"'The priests of the Mysteries were symbolized as a serpent, sometimes called Hydra.' \"[And then he] pointed out that the Ancient Mysteries had been passed on to various other cultures, and that they have been brought forward to the present ‐ day.\" Folks, we'll continue this tomorrow night. If you can, reach into your pockets, make out a check or money order... [William Cooper asks for donations] Until tomorrow night, good night and God bless each and every single one of you.

You're listening to the Hour of the Time, and I'm William Cooper. (opening music: sound effects ‐‐ a bugle playing Reveille , followed by two types of warning alarms, followed by various types of gunfire and explosions, followed by a bugle playing Taps ) Ladies and gentlemen, what you have just listened to is a warning...is a warning. For there is a war being conducted right at this moment ‐‐ a war against the American people. It is now a shooting war, and the second battle is being fought. The first was fought in the state of Idaho against the family of Randy Weaver. The second battle is being fought by a brave group of men and women and children in a church, known as Branch Davidian, in Waco, Texas. They are fighting for their Creator ‐ endowed rights. They have committed no crimes. They know what the sound of battle is. They know what it's like to see their friends or relatives die in their arms or at their feet. They know what it's like to have wounded and be refused medicine and medical treatment. Oh, yes, we are at war. Make no mistake about it. And if you don't believe that, you keep your eyes and ears open in the next weeks, months, and years. You will see it escalate across this country like a wild forest fire, out of control. And unless the sheeple wake up and listen and learn and act, I predict that there will be civil war in the United States of America. Because there are many of us who will not ever give up our Creator ‐ endowed rights, our right to keep and bear arms, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights, without one hell of a fight. And what you heard at the beginning of this program, folks, for those of you who have never experienced war, was the real sounds of war. What you heard were real bullets being fired, real bombs being dropped, real machine guns killing real people. And Taps , at the end, of what was a real bugle blowing real Taps over real graves of real fallen men who were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. You see, many people have already died protecting what many of you are giving up. I, for one, will not. When they come for me, there will be another battle. I will not give up. And I don't care who wins or loses, because at the end of my battle it would be just the beginning of yours. Do you understand what I'm telling you? You see, my whole purpose is to wake enough people so that no battles ever have to be fought. But we're already behind because two have already been fought, and more, I guarantee you, are on the way. Guaranteed, folks. Guaranteed. Because the more we allow them to get away with, the more they will attempt. I don't want a civil war in this country. I want to stop it before it even has a chance to start, and the only way to do that is wake up America. You see, if two hundred million people stand up with their right under the second article and amendment to the Constitution, holding a weapon in their hand, and say, \"Enough! We will not put up with this anymore! Stop it now! Get out of our government! Get out of our cities! Get out of our military! And stay out!\" that will be the end of it and no shot will have to be fired. I guarantee that. But what do you think the odds are of that happening?

Hall wrote this:] 'The Serpent Kings [ ‐‐ and notice that Mr. Hall capitalized the two words, as one would do for a deity or for royalty when he wrote this ‐‐ ] reigned over the earth.'\" [William Cooper]: The Serpent Kings reigned over the earth. \"'It was these Serpent Kings who founded the Mystery Schools which later appeared as the Egyptian and Brahmin Mysteries...The serpent was their symbol...They were the true Sons of Light, and from them have descended a long line of adepts and initiates duly tried and proven according to the law.'\" [William Cooper]: And the proper term is not Freemason, it's frère ‐ maçon . It comes from the French, from the Knights of Templar, and it literally means 'the Sons of Light'. \"Another writer, Wilfred Gregson, informed his readers why Mr. Hall capitalized the two words \"Serpent Kings\" when he wrote: \"'One symbol of great prominence throughout all ancient civilizations is the snake, or serpent, where it has symbolized \"Divine Wisdom.\"' \"So, Mr. Hall had reason to capitalize the words, because he had discovered that the serpent represented divinity. Notice also[, folks,] that Mr. Gregson, even though he chose not to capitalize the word 'serpent,' confirmed that Mr. Hall's use of the capital letter was correct when he stated that there was a connection between 'Divine Wisdom' and the serpent. \"Mr. Hall[, a 33rd degree Mason,] made the same connection in these comments: \"'The serpent is true to the principles of wisdom, for it tempts man to the knowledge of himself.' \"A serpent is 'often used by the ancients to symbolize wisdom.' \"The symbol of the serpent has another concealed truth, according to Kenneth McKenzie. [For] he identified that truth in this quote when he described a Brazen Serpent: \"'It was a type of Mediator, and a promise of redemption.' \"The word Brazen[, folks,] is defined as 'bold, or impudent.' And Impudent is defined as 'shamelessly bold or disrespectful.' [Now, you will remember] that Lucifer was an anointed cherub in heaven, who fell because he sought godly power. The story is covered in Isaiah [chapter 14, verses 12 ‐ 14 of the Old Testament [Look it up. It says this]: \"'How are thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground...For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God...I will be like the Most High.' \"Therefore, it can be safely said that Lucifer would be considered to be 'shamelessly bold' and[, of course,] 'disrespectful.' It appears that the Brazen Serpent could be Lucifer! \"Another author, John Anthony West, wrote a book entitled Serpent In The Sky , in which he also connected the serpent with 'wisdom.' [And] he wrote [this]: \"'...the serpent represents intellect, the faculty by which man discriminates. There is a higher and a lower intellect. Thus, symbolically, there is a serpent that crawls and the higher intellect, that which allows man to know God ‐‐ the heavenly serpent, the serpent in the sky.' \"The somewhat veiled worship of this serpent in the sky inside the Masonic lodges was alluded to by another Masonic writer, Kenneth MacKenzie[. For] in his book entitled The Royal Masonic Encyclopedia , he wrote this: \"'Among the charges preferred against the Order of the Knights of Templar, for which Jacques de Molay suffered martyrdom, was that of worshiping an idol or image called Baphomet. It has been suggested that Baphomet is none other than the Ancient of Days, or Creator. 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"More cannot be said here without improperly revealing what we [meaning [the] Masons] are bound to hele, conceal and never reveal.' \"So, according to this Mason, the snake or serpent is somehow a symbol of the [subject of the] Masonic worship, and apparently this fact is the secret [that] the Masons cannot reveal to the rest of the world. \"A Christian minister, Reverend Alexander Hislop, wrote a book that included some discussion on the subject of serpent worship. [And] in that book, entitled Two Babylons , he explained that serpent worship was not something that is recent in time. It was an ancient practice. \"'Along with the sun [this symbol will be discussed later,] as the great fire ‐ god, and, in due time, identified with him, was the serpent worshiped In the mythology of the primitive world, the serpent is universally the symbol of the sun...as the sun [was] the great enlightener of the physical world, so the serpent was held to have been the great enlightener of the spiritual, by giving mankind the 'knowledge of good and evil.'\" [William Cooper]: And, according to the Bible, you know who gave man the knowledge of good and evil: Satan, Lucifer. \"He then discussed a coin minted in Tyre, the center of the ancient Phoenician culture. (This coin was also the subject of an article in the September, 1986 issue of The Good News magazine.) It depicted a serpent entwined around a tree stump. To the left of the stump stood an empty cornucopia, and to the right a flourishing palm tree. The snake on the coin is the symbol of the powerful god whom the Romans called Aesculapius. The name means 'the man ‐ instructing snake,' or 'the snake that instructs man.' And the article then reported: \"'In mythology, Aesculapius was believed to be the child of the Sun, and thus the \"enlightener\" of mankind. As the legend goes, Aesculapius was ultimately struck down by a thunderbolt thrown by an angry Zeus, king of the gods, and cast into the underworld.' \"The tree stump[, folks,] represented the fallen 'god' and his ruined kingdom. In the mythologies of many ancient civilizations, the image of a fallen tree was used to symbolize the cutting off of a great god or hero, someone cut of in the midst of their power. [You see,] the snake on the coin was shown twisting itself around the dead stump, exerting its power in an attempt to restore his fallen kingdom. \"The cornucopia is an ancient symbol of plenty, but it was empty on the coin. This has been interpreted as meaning that the abundance had been cut off because the great 'god' has been cut off. However, [folks,] the implication is that the horn of plenty will return when the fallen 'god' is restored to his 'rightful' position. The palm tree shown on the coin is a well know symbol of victory. So it appears that the coin was minted to depict the anticipated return of the fallen snake ‐ god to the world. \"[And] the Bible talks about a fallen serpent in the book of Revelation, chapter 12, verse 9. However, in this case, [folks,] the snake is connected to another symbol of the serpent: 'a great dragon.' \"'And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan...' \"Is the serpent worshiped in the Ancient Mysteries and a symbol [in the] Masonic ceremonies a symbol of Satan, the devil? As has already been discussed, there is indeed evidence[, folks,] that this is the case.\" [William Cooper]: And once you have confronted the evidence and studied as much as I have studied, you will know that they are one and the same. \"Another symbol that needs to be analyzed is the star. On the page opposite page 124 in Mackey's Encyclopaedia is a drawing illustrating the 'symbols of Freemasonry.' Included in the twenty or so Masonic symbols is a drawing of a shooting star. \"[Now,] it can be fairly claimed that a blazing or shooting star would be one that was on the move inside the universe. One of the directions it could move would be, of course, towards the earth. If it was moving towards the earth, it could be called a 'falling star.'\" [William Cooper]: But we know that most falling stars are actually meteors and not stars at all. \"Lucifer[, however,] is a 'fallen angel,' according to Isaiah, an Old Testament prophet, who wrote this in Isaiah [chapter 14, verse 12]: 'How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer...' \"[Now, folks,] notice that Isaiah also said that Lucifer fell from heaven. And other parts of the Bible report that he fell to the earth. So, it is conceivable that the symbol of the 'falling' or 'blazing' star could be a symbol of Lucifer. 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"\"A variety of authors have used their writings to discuss the star as a symbol. Professor Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the [Bavarian] Illuminati, was one who explained what he considered the star to be a symbol of [listen closely]: \"'...the Flaming Star is the Torch of Reason.' \"Mr. Mackey wrote that the star: 'was a symbol of God.' He then connected the blazing star to another symbol when he wrote: 'The Blazing Star...refers us to the sun...' And then he connected it with the secret initiation [ceremonies] inside the Masonic lodge: 'In the Fourth Degree of the same Rite [the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry] the [Blazing Star] is again said to be a symbol of the light of Divine Providence pointing out the way of truth.' \"And Mr. Hutchens, the Masonic writer who has authored the recent book on Masonry, further interpreted the symbol of the star [thusly]: 'The star as a type of the myriad suns that light other countless systems of worlds is an emblem of that Masonic Light in search of which every Mason travels ‐‐ the correct knowledge of the Deity, and of His laws that control the universe.' \"[Now] closely allied [with the] symbol of the star is the symbol of the sun. Albert Pike identified it with the worship of the past in this collection of quotes from his writings [and pay close attention]: \"'The worship of the sun became the basis of all the religions of antiquity.' \"'...thousands of years ago, men worshiped the Sun...Originally, they looked beyond the orb to the invisible God...They personified him as Brahma, Amun, Osiris, Bel, Adonis, Malkarth, Mithras, and Apollo. Krishna is the Hindu Sun ‐ God.' \"'the Gauls worshiped the Sun under the name of Belin or Belinis.' \"'The sun is the ancient symbol of the life ‐ giving and generative power of the Deity. The Sun was His manifestation and visible image.' \"'The Sun is the hieroglyphical sign of Truth, because it is the source of Light.' \"So, Mr. Pike identified the sun as a symbol of a deity that should be worshiped He chose to capitalize the first letter of the word, the 's', as one would in recognizing the name of a deity.\" [William Cooper]: And if you've been listening to this series, you already know that, of course, it was. \"Albert Mackey repeated Mr. Pike's contentions with comments like these about 'sun worship': \"'...[it was] the oldest and by far the most prevalent of all the ancient religions. Eusebius says that the Phoenicians and the Egyptians were the first who ascribed divinity to the sun.' \"'Hardly any of the symbols of Masonry are more important in their signification or more extensive in their application than the sun as the source of material light, it minds the Mason of that intellectual light of which he is in constant search. \"'The sun is then presented to us in Masonry first as a symbol of light, but then more emphatically as a symbol of sovereign authority.' \"So, [folks,] the sun was a symbol of something that only the believers in the religion known as the Ancient Mysteries understood. These believers, called adepts, certainly knew that the people would not accept their mystery religion, so they had to conceal it from them.\" [William Cooper]: Don't go away, folks. We've got to take a short break. I'll be right back after this pause. (break music: none) [continuing reading from The New World Order , written by A. Ralph Epperson]: \"So the task became one of creating a religion around a belief that they knew people would accept, because it would make some sense, at least as far as the adepts would explain it. But their basic purpose was to create a popular religion as a cover for their secret worship. \"The secret religion would be built around a belief in the sun. 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"\"The sun would be a perfect thing to build a religion around because of its basic nature. It is very visible, and has a very important role in man's life. It rises in the morning (it appears to be born) and [then] sets in the evening, (it appears to die) and then appears to be 'born again' the next morning. It also appears to wander in the sky, setting further north (or south) each night. It then returns back to any given position twice each year. \"So the sun appears to have a major birth or death twice each day and twice each year. It would[, of course,] be very easy for the adepts to explain to the people that only something bigger than mankind, a god, had the ability to die and come back to life. So, the adepts would teach the people that they had to pray to the god or it would chose not to return. They encouraged a worship of the sun so that it would return to mankind again, either once a day, or once every six months. \"Albert Pike confirmed this view with this explanation of why early man worshiped the sun: 'To them [meaning early man]...the journeyings of the Sun, were voluntary and not mechanical...' \"So early man considered the sun to be something that moved voluntarily. In other words, the sun did not have to return each morning. Man must have quickly determined that since the sun did not have to return, man should start asking it to return. For man certainly depended upon the sun for his life. Man certainly must have figured out just how important the sun was to his life and well ‐ being and certainly must have determined that if the sun chose not to return, all of mankind would certainly perish. So it was an easy jump from the belief that the necessary sun was an entity that chose to move across the daytime sky, to a belief that it would return only if man prayed to it to return. (William Cooper does another commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation) \"But[, folks,] there is something even more interesting to be considered that Pike didn't explain with that comment. \"Obviously, to make the new religion work, the believers would have to be able to predict the movements of the sun. It wouldn't be too long before some of the common people would start noticing that the sun was neither an actual being nor a god to be worshiped, but something that moved according to precise laws. [Now,] if the common people figured that out, they would not need the adepts who had computed the sun's periodic cycles. So, to keep their power intact, they would teach the people that if they did not accommodate their wishes, they would make certain that the sun did not return. They could even predict, as their measurements became more sophisticated, the exact time and date when the moon would go between the sun and the earth, causing the sun to 'disappear.' They could then fool the people into believing that they were the cause of the disappearance. They could then[, of course,] explain to the people that if they did not continue to pay them sort of tribute, they would not intercede on their behalf, and the sun would not reappear. \"To keep the minds of the common people[, the sheeple,] away from figuring out that the whole religion was a scam, the adepts would conduct beautiful and ornate ceremonies around the worship of the sun. And they would expect the people to pay them for the elaborate rituals. And to make their rituals valid, the adepts would always claim that the sun obeyed their prayers, thereby convincing the people of their need to keep the adepts around. The people[, I mean the sheeple,] would continue to pay tribute to these adepts as long as they appeared to be successful. \"Now, [folks,] if the adepts knew that the sun was a symbol of something that the people would not support, such as a belief that Lucifer, the devil, was the god that they worshiped, they would have to continue with [their] charade, so that the people would not decide to stop worshiping. Because if the [sheeple] figured it out, they would no longer support their activities. They would have to keep their beliefs from the people, and conceal their secret worship in hidden symbols. So sun worship as a religion prospered. \"Mr. Hutchens discussed that position in his book...\" [William Cooper]: And I also discussed it in mine, Behold A Pale Horse . \"Mr. Hutchens [said this]: 'In the Tabernacle the brethren clothed in black, mourn Osiris, who is representative of the sun, of light, of life, of good and beauty. They reflect upon the way the earth may again be gladdened by his presence.' \"Mr. Pike connected the sun to Osiris, mentioned by Mr. Hutchens as worthy of being mourned: 'The three lights that the Altar [inside the Masonic Temple] represent Osiris, Isis and Horus. Osiris was represented by the Sun.' \"Mr. Mackey went a little further and informed his readers that: 'Osiris was the sun.' 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"\"In his book entitled Introduction To Freemasonry , Carl H. Claudy, the author, himself a Mason, connected the sun worship with ceremonies inside the Masonic Lodge: 'The lodge...sets him [meaning the initiate] upon the path that leads to Light but it is for him to...travel the winding path to the symbolic East.' \"The physical sun rises in the east, and the Masons explain that their search for light begins in the east. And notice that Mr. Claudy capitalizes the word 'East,' apparently in reverence to the spot where they believe that this god resides. The Masons tell the world that they circumambulate (defined as walking around) the Temple floor during their initiation ceremonies. Mr. Claudy explains why this rite is performed: \"'When the candidate first circles the lodge room about the altar, he walks step by step with a thousand shades of men who have thus worshiped the Most High by humble imitation. Thus thought of circumambulation is no longer a mere parade but a ceremony of significance, linking all who take part in it with the spiritual aspirations of a dim and distant past.'\" [William Cooper]: And it is a historical fact that the Knights Templar also performed the circumambulation of their temples. \"[And] he further instructs his readers as to why this ceremony is part of their ceremony: 'Early man circled altars on which burned the fire which was his God, from east to west by way of the south [notice that the north is not included in the ceremony. The significance of that omission will be discussed later.] [But,] circumambulation became a part of all religious observances.' \"In another part of his book, entitled Introduction To Freemasonry , Mr. Claudy reported that this style of walking was traceable to the ancient religions of the past [when] he wrote [this]: 'Circumambulation...was in the ceremonies of ancient Egypt.' \"So, this practice of the modern Masons is based upon the ancient [pagan] religious practices of the Ancients. So the Masons are telling us that early man walked around in a circle because he was worshiping the sun. Then they tell us they are doing it for the same reasons. \"There are reasons that the north as a location to be visited in their walk around the temple floor is not included in their initiation rites, and six of the great Masonic writers have told us why this is so. \"Captain William Morgan offered his readers this explanation with this comment from his book [William Cooper: the writing of which he was murdered for]: '...we, therefore, Masonically, turn the north a place of darkness.' \"Mr. Mackey confirmed that statement in his book: 'The north is Masonically called the place of darkness.' And Mr. Pike confirmed the comments made by the other two Masons with this declaration: 'To all Masons, the North has immediately been the place of darkness, and of the great lights of the Lodge, none is in the North.' \"And Kenneth McKenzie added his confirming thoughts: 'The North was always esteemed a place of darkness.' Mr. Hutchens became the fifth Masonic writer to confirm this detail [as he said this]: \"'As in other degrees, the closing ritual provides a summary of the lessons taught in the degree. We hear in the West the eagles gather and the doom of tyranny is near. In the South, truth struggles against error and oppression. In the North, fanaticism and intolerance wane. In the East, the people begin to know their rights and to be conscious of their dignity and that the sun's rays will soon smite the summits of the mountains.' \"Mr. Hutchens informed his readers that the North was where 'fanaticism and tolerance' resided. What he meant by this and what the symbol of the North represents will be explored...later... \"And the sixth Masonic writer who confirmed that the North was a place of darkness was Carl Claudy, who wrote in his book entitled Introduction To Freemasonry : '...the place of darkness, the North.' \"And the reason the Masons do not include the North in their rites is found in the Bible...[in the Bible]...[repeats: The reason] the Masons do not include the North in their rites is found in the Bible in Isaiah, chapter 14, verse 13: 'I [meaning Lucifer] will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the North.' \"The God of the Bible sits in the North, and Lucifer hopes one day to acquire the throne of God for his throne. But, until then, the 'North is a place of darkness.' But, while the north is an excluded territory, the east is the 'place of light,' and is to be revered. Mr. Hutchens tells his readers why that is so: '...the East ‐‐ the source of light, and thus knowledge.' \"Albert Mackey quotes Etienne Francois Bazot, a French Masonic writer in his Encyclopedia : 'The veneration which the Masons have for 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"the East...bears a relations to the primitive religion whose first degeneration was sun ‐ worship.' \"Rex Hutchens then tells his readers that the masons deploy lights around the Lodge room during the initiation ceremony for the 25th degree called the Knight of the Sun. [And] he writes: 'The ceiling should be decorated to represent the heavens with the moon, the principle planets and the constellations Taurus and Orion. A single powerful light, a great globe of glass representing the sun, is in the South. In a typical sense the greater light comes from the sun and the transparencies provide lesser light...symbolically, the sun or great light is the Truth and the lesser lights are man's symbolic representation of Truth.' \"Mr. Mackey further discusses this Rite of Circumambulation, as he calls it, in his Encyclopedia . He says that the rite: 'exists in Freemasonry...the people always walked three times round the altar while singing a sacred hymn. In making this procession, great care was taken to move an imitation of the course of the sun.' \"He then assisted the reader with understanding this practice in the Masonic temples: 'This Rite of Circumambulation undoubtedly refers to the doctrine of sun ‐ worship...' \"However, in another of the books that he wrote, Mr. Mackey directly states that the rite is connected to sun worship. This is what he wrote in a book entitled Manual Of The Lodge : 'The circumambulation among the pagan nations referred to the great doctrines of Sabaism or sun worship.' \"Sabaism is defined by Mr. Mackey in his encyclopedia as: 'Sabaism; The worship of the sun, moon and stars, 'the host of heaven.' It was practiced in Persia, Chaldea, India, and other Oriental countries, at an early period in the world's history.' He then added this rather cryptic comment: '...and although the dogma of sun ‐ worship does not of course exist in Freemasonry, we find an allusion to it in the Rite of circumambulation which it preserves...' \"[Now,] one can understand what Mr. Mackey meant by that comment: the Masons do not worship the sun, they worship the Sun!\" [William Cooper]: (laughs) With a capitol 'S'. So he was telling the truth, but concealing it in a symbolic language, for he wrote 'sun' with a small 's'. You have to understand the symbology of the Mystery Schools or you will never understand anything, dear listeners. \"Mr. Hutchens then volunteered the information that in the 12th of the 32 degrees the Rite of Circumambulation is preserved. [And] he writes: 'In all the Scottish Rite Degrees thus far, the candidate has made twenty ‐ one prescribed circuits around the altar; this degree adds seven, for a total of twenty ‐ eight. \"'[And] this practice, called circumambulation, is derived from the ancients and existed among the Romans, Semites, Hindus, and others. It is thought to have been a rite of purification. The sun was believed to travel around the earth; the initiates imitated the movement of the sun when they made circuits around the altar.' \"Furthermore, [dear listeners,] in the ninth degree, other symbols of the sun are involved in the ceremony. [And] Mr. Hutchens tells his readers: 'After the obligation is taken, the nine candles of yellow wax are lit. Yellow is representative of the sun, hence light and knowledge.' \"In the tenth degree, further symbols representing the sun are utilized, according to this author: 'There are three sets of five lights: the wax is yellow, meaning knowledge and also, as the color of the sun, represents the Deity.'\" [William Cooper]: A blatant admission that the sun represents the deity that they worship. \"Other clues that the sun and the serpent are both known symbols of the Masonic Lodge are given by the titles of two of the 32 degrees inside the Masonic Lodge. The 25th degree initiate is called a Knight of the Brazen Serpent, and the 28th degree initiate is called a Knight of the Sun [William Cooper: with a capitol 'S']. \"There's another symbol of the sun inside the Masonic Lodge. The Worshipful Master, the equivalent of the President of the Lodge, sits in the east side of the temple. [And] we are told why that is: 'The Worshipful Master represents the sun at its rising, the Senior Warden [another officer of the Lodge] represents the sun at its setting, and the Junior Warden [still another officer of the Lodge] represents the sun at meridian [the half ‐ way point.] [William Cooper: The Most High.] \"Other individuals and organizations besides the Masonic Lodges are also involved, [folks,] in [various...]varying degrees, with sun worship, or with an acknowledgment that the sun plays a central role in their understanding of the nature of the world. \"Elizabeth Clare Prophet has been described as being a leader in the New Age Movement, as she has written this in a newsletter she 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"publishes called The Coming Revolution : 'the healing of the nations begins with the healing of ourselves. We must draw forth from the Great Central Sun ‐‐ that eternal Light with which we were anointed from the beginning.' Adolf Hitler, [William Cooper: I'm sure you've heard of him,] the head of the German government prior to and during World War II, and who was directly responsible for the murder of over 50 million people, was also a sun worshiper Very early in his life, he joined a secret organization called the Thule Society. And forty years after the war, some historians are finally delving into its strange beliefs. Two of these writers, Michel Bertrand and Jean Angelini, have produced a book entitled The Occult And The Third Reich , and one of their conclusions is: 'In the Nazi cosmology the sun played a prime role...as a sacred symbol of the Aryans, in contrast to the feminine and magical symbolism of the moon, revered by the Semitic peoples. \"'The Nazi Party was the name of the National Socialist German Worker's Party, the party that Mr. Hitler joined. It became [the] controlling party of the German government prior to and during war. \"'...the Fuhrer [German for leader, in this case meaning Mr. Hitler] saw in the Jewish people, with their black hair and swarthy complexion, the dark side of the human species, while the blond and blue ‐ eyed Aryans constituted the light side of humanity. Hitler undertook to extirpate [meaning to eliminate] from the material world its impure elements...to lead it back to glory.' \"But sun worship, as the Masons point out, is not new. The Bible talks about is as well. \"[Folks,] Ezekiel was an Old [World] Testament prophet writing sometime during the period of 571 to 592 B.C. [And] he tells about how he was taken by God to see a practice occurring near the Temple. [And] this is what he wrote in Ezekiel, chapter 8, verses 15 and 16: \"'And He [the Lord God] brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and they worshiped the sun toward the east.' \"And Ezekiel points out that the Lord God considered this practice 'an abomination.' \"There is another reference to sun worship from the Old Testament, this time in Deuteronomy, [chapter 17, verses 2 through 4 and then verse 7]. [And] that reference reads as follows: 'If there be found among you,...man or woman...that...hath gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven...and it be true...that such an abomination is wrought in Israel...so thou shalt put the evil away from among you.' \"So[, folks,] the God of the Bible has made it [perfectly] clear that sun worship is something that He does not want[, He does not want] His creatures practicing [this]. The Bible even went so far as to say, in both instances, that He considered the practice to be an 'abomination' or an 'evil.' \"But to show just how far this practice has invaded the Christian community, the following 'prayer' was offered up at a recent funeral in a local Christian church: 'Now you will feel no rain, for your Mother, the earth, will fold her arms around you. Now you will feel no cold, for your Father, the Sun, will always warm you.' \"Sun worship continues. Because some Christian churches pray to the Sun god in their church services. And don't understand who they are praying to. Simply stated[, simply stated, dear listeners,] the Sun god that they were praying to is Lucifer!\" [William Cooper]: Lucifer, also known as Satan, or the devil. Wakes you up, doesn't it? See, all the time you thought religion was something stupid and didn't have anything to do with overall world events, but you're wrong. It has everything to do with everything, whether you believe it or not, whether I believe it or not, it doesn't make any difference. If the people who have the power and are in control believe it, it will affect us all. Understand that, because that's true.

And I am going to give you the names, authors and publishing companies of the books that will start you off to bring you up to speed where I am at. And you're just going to get what you need to get to a beginning level tonight. I suggest, if you can, that you tape record this episode of the Hour of the Time so that you can play the tape back and refer to it. If you do not have the facilities to do this, you may order a studio quality stereo tape done on a digital mixer from Stan Barrington.

It's sort of a mixture, but you have to have the information available to do the research and come up with the answers. 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"OK, and once you have that book, you have everything you need to know about the history, the ideals, the purpose, everything behind the founding of this country, and if you don’t know that, you don’t know anything about this country, so you need it. The next book that I'm going to recommend, because you need to know the symbology and the history and who these people really are, is a book that was originally printed in the 1700’s. In fact, the beginning...it's called the...the Templar’s chart ‐‐ the Masonic Chart , the Templar chart ‐‐ and the beginning has a letter to the editors of the New York Express, and its signed by Benjamin Franklin. It’s a very old book. It has the complete history, according to Freemasonry, of Freemasonry. It's entitled ‐‐ and this is the title of the book ‐‐ The True Masonic Chart or Hieroglyphic Monitor; Containing All the Emblems Explained in the Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason, Mark Master, Past Master, Most Excellent Master, Royal Arch, Royal Master, and Select Master: Designed and Duly Arranged Agreeably to the Lectures , by R.W. Jeremy L. Cross, G.L., to which are added illustrations, charges, songs, etc., with additions and emendations. Also, a complete history of Freemasonry by a brother. This copy that I have is the twelfth and stereotyped edition, printed in New York, published by A.S. Barnes and Company, 51 Johns St. in 1854. You can find treasures like this if you look. Most people though sit back and say, \"(nasally voice: Oh, I don’t know where to find that. I don’t know anything about doing research. Why don’t you tell me?\" (laughs) That’s not the way to do it, folks...not the way to do it. Second book I'm going to recommend here that you get is a book by Joseph Campbell, probably the world's foremost authority on myth and mythology. This book is entitled Primitive Mythology, the Masks of God . Again, it's by Joseph Campbell, Primitive Mythology, the Masks of God , and I believe it's printed by Penguin...Penguin Books. OK, next one is also by Joseph Campbell, Occidental Mythology, the Masks of God , by Joseph Campbell. Entitled Occidental Mythology, The Masks of God . Also published by Penguin...Penguin Books. Now I've got all these books stacked up around here, so if you hear a moment of silence, it's because I'm reaching for something. I literally have surrounded myself with stacks of books. I'm going to give you the title, author, and publisher of as many as I can, starting with the most important for you to use to get started with and working on that. [sic] Next one is by Joseph Campbell again. The title is Creative Mythology, The Masks of God . Creative Mythology, The Masks of God , also by Joseph Campbell and published by Penguin Books. The next one, folks, is The Sacred and the Profane . The title is The Sacred and the Profane . The subtitle is, The Nature of Religion, the Significance of Religious Myths, Symbolism and Ritual Within Life and Culture , and it's by Mircea Eliade. Mircea Eliade ‐‐ it's actually translated from a foreign language. It's printed by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. Next one is an important book once you get to...Once you get into the symbology of the Mystery Schools and the occult, you learn that geometry and Hermetic science become very important. Now, this book is entitled Occult Geometry and Hermetic Science of Motion and Number . Occult Geometry and Hermetic Science of Motion and Number , a combined edition by A.S. Raleigh. A.S. Raleigh, and this is published by Devorss...Devorss Publications. That’s spelled D ‐ E ‐ V (as in Victor) ‐ O ‐ R ‐ S ‐ S. And there’s some treasures in these books. Now, these are books that most people pass by. They look at them and say, \"Ah, this is...this is boring,\" or, \"I would never learn anything from that.\" And most people would never even pick up one of these books. But, I'm telling you folks, you better start. Next one is entitled Celestial Symbols . Celestial Symbols: Symbolism in Doctrine, Religious Traditions and Temple Architecture , by Allen H. Barber. Allen H. Barber, and this is published by Horizon Publishers. Sometimes you get to understand that even the names of the publishers, and, sometimes, the name of the authors, are symbolic. Horizon, as you already learned, means \"Horus rising.\" Horizon Publishers and Distributors, Incorporated, PO Box 490, Bountiful, Utah. And that book contains some revelations. Another one is entitled Many Moons . Many Moons: The Myth and Magic, Fact and Fantasy of Our Nearest Heavenly Body , by Diana Brueton, introduction by Col. James Irwin of the Apollo 11 mission. (laughs) Oh, yes, it gets very interesting...very interesting. And this is published by Prentice Hall Press, New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore. So I know you can find this book. Now, we're going to get into some other areas now, and I'm going to attempt to, sort of, explain to you some of the things that are in these books. And you need to start with some history. The first book that I want to recommend to you is entitled Holy Blood, Holy Grail , by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh. Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh. Holy Blood, Holy Grail . The next one is The Messianic Legacy . The Messianic Legacy , by the same authors: Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh. And then there's another one called, The Temple and the Lodge . The Temple and the Lodge , by the same authors. And then the fourth one by these authors, also, is called The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception . The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception , by the same authors. Now, read those books. Read them in that order. The last one just came out. I just ordered it myself, have not read it, but I know, because I have 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"read the other three, that I need to read it, and it's going to be just as revealing as the first three. Now, none of these books put together the whole picture... I've done that. But they all have pieces to the puzzle that you need to find for yourself, so that you'll know that I'm not leading you down the garden path. That's important. Now, in that series of books, folks, it outlines the history ‐‐ as they have discovered it ‐‐ of a secret society whose sole purpose is to protect the bloodline of the family which, traditionally, throughout history has claimed the divine right to rule the rest of us. It's important that you know about that family, because the same people (laughs) also rule this country, folks. They're all related, if you haven't figured that out yet. And if you want to find out how related they are, start looking into an organization, organized in [Cincinnati], called the Knights of the Golden Circle. The Knights of the Golden Circle. The next book that I want you to pick up and read is entitled Julius Caesar . Julius Caesar , a biography by Michael Grant. Now, in this book, it outlines the...a lot of things about ancient Rome: their political machinery; the way that Rome was really ruled by families, which is going to be the same way in the New World Order ‐‐ I can guarantee you that. And it talks a lot about the ancient religions in this book. It's very revealing. It’s a biography, it’s factual; it's not fiction at all, and you need to read it. The next book is an extremely important book and puts a lot of pieces of the puzzle together. And the person who wrote this book didn’t actually set out to even write about this subject. What he was doing was trying to research the Peasants' Revolt in England, and ended up writing a book about Freemasonry, because of what he found out in his investigation into the Peasants' Revolt in England. And that man is John J. Robinson. John J. Robinson. The title of the book is Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry . Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry . I'm just going to read to you a little bit from the dust jacket here: \"Its mysterious symbols and rituals had been used in secret for centuries before Freemasonry revealed itself in London in 1717. Once known, Freemasonry spread throughout the world and attracted kings, emperors and statesmen to take its sacred oaths. It also attracted great revolutionaries such as George Washington and Sam Houston in America, Juárez in Mexico, Garibaldi in Italy, and Bolívar in South America. It was outlawed over the centuries by Hitler, Mussolini and the Ayatollah Khomeini. But where had this powerful organization come from? What was it doing in those secret centuries before it arose from underground more than 270 years ago? And why was Freemasonry attacked with such intense hatred by the Roman Catholic Church? \"This amazing detective story answers these questions and proves that the Knights Templar in Britain, fleeing arrest and torture by pope and King, formed a secret society of mutual protection that came to be called Freemasonry. Based on years of meticulous research, this book solves the last remaining mysteries of the Masons ‐‐ their secret words, symbols and allegories whose true meanings have been lost in antiquity. With a richly drawn background of the bloody battles, the opportunistic kings and scheming popes, the tortures and religious persecution that were the Middle Ages, it is an important book that may require that we to take a new look at the history of events leading to the Protestant Reformation.\" And you’ve already heard (laughs) about that on this show. But you need this book, Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry . Get it. The next book is by the same author, John J. Robinson. After he wrote Born in Blood , he was intrigued, and so...He wrote Born in Blood about Freemasonry, and then he had to go back and research the history of the Knights Templar. And he wrote this book, entitled Dungeon, Fire and Sword . Dungeon, Fire and Sword: The Knights Templar in the Crusades , by John J. Robinson, author of Born in Blood . And I'm going to read to you from this fly leaf. But...yeah, I will. \"Over the past thousand years, the bloodiest game of king ‐ of ‐ the ‐ hill has been for supremacy on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the site of the ancient Temple of Solomon. This book recounts the stirring saga of the Knights Templar, the Christian warrior ‐ monks who occupied the sacred Mount in the aftermath of the butchery of the First Crusade. Recruited to a life of poverty, chastity and obedience intended to lead only to martyrdom on the battlefield, they were totally dedicated to the pious paradox that the wholesale slaughter of non ‐ believers would earn the eternal gratitude of the Prince of Peace. \"The Templars amassed great wealth, which they used to finance their two hundred years of war against the Muslims on the desert, in the mountains, and up the broad sweep of the Nile valley. The Templars’ reward for those two centuries of military martyrdom was to be arrested by pope and king, tortured by the Inquisition, and finally decreed out of existence. But their legend and legacy just would not die. \"In telling the incredible story of the Knights Templar, the author's clear explanation of the cultural and religious differences among the Templars’ enemies and friends in the Middle East gives fresh understanding of the people who populate this restless region. Here are the Sunnis and the Shiites, the Kurds and Armenians, the Arabs and Turks, who figure so prominently in today’s headlines. The similarity of their antagonisms today and those of eight hundred years ago are often so striking as to be eerie. 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"\" Dungeon, Fire & Sword is a brilliant work of narrative history that can be read as an adventure story, a morality play, or a lesson in the politics of warfare.\" But, folks, be careful when you read these books that you do not believe them blindly, for sometimes the authors are taken in by exoteric. But you still need to read them. Don’t go away folks, we got to take our break. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: This Land is Your Land , performed by Lee Greenwood?) [William Cooper does commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation, asks for air time donations] And now, folks, we continue with our bibliography. I hope you've all got pen and paper and you're writing just as fast as you can. Don’t worry if you don’t get them all; if you just get some of them and start reading, that’s what counts. You can always order this tape and play it back, and copy them down at your leisure. At some future date we will print a bibliography, but right now, to tell you the truth, folks, we just don’t have time to do that. We're so much engaged in producing this radio show and researching, and I'm writing a second book and traveling and speaking. And, I'll tell ya something, right now I barely have time to talk to my wife, and she doesn’t appreciate to much, so (laughs) were going away this weekend. The next book, The Future of Man . The Future of Man . Once again, The Future of Man , by Robert Klark Graham. Robert Klark Graham. You can order this book for seven dollars from S.C. Books, P.O. Box 1562, that P.O. Box 1562, Friendswood, Texas. Friendswood, Texas, 77546. Once again, seven dollars for this book from S.C. Books, P.O. Box 1562, Friendswood Texas, 77546. Boy, I'm really going to have to hurry to get (laughs) a substantial amount of these books in. I hear somebody out there screaming and pulling their hair out, \"I can’t possibly read all these books!\" Yes, you can. I've done it. I've read every book in my library, folks, and my library is bigger than most city libraries. If I can do it, you can do it. The only thing that will stop you is because you don’t want to do it. And if you learn how to do productive research, some of them you don’t have to read the whole books, believe me. [sic] You just have to learn how to do that. But you have to understand what the context of the book is before you take anything out of context. You can get in big trouble by doing that, believe me. Next book is A History of Mathematics . A History of Mathematics , second edition, by Carl B. Boyer. That’s A History of Mathematics , second edition, by Carl B. Boyer, B ‐ O ‐ Y ‐ E ‐ R. And the forward is by Isaac Asimov, and this is published by Wiley (W ‐ I ‐ L ‐ E ‐ Y). Should be able...in fact, you should find that in most good book stores. It should be on the shelf. Next one is the Dead Sea Scrolls. Be very careful about the Dead Sea Scrolls, folks, because everybody who's had their hands on them has been in the pay of the Rockefeller family, and the people who are translating them now are in the pay of the Rockefeller family. And they say that some of them have leaked out and that you're getting the real version...you don’t know that. This could have been intentional leaks and nobody, none of us, know how to really translate these things. So, the Rockefellers, basically, are telling us what the Dead Sea Scrolls say, and I can just about tell you what they're gonna tell us right off the bat: That Jesus didn’t die, and all kinds of things, and, well, just wait and see. Just wait and see. This is called Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls . Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls , a reader from the Biblical Archeology Review, edited by Hershel Shanks. Hershel Shanks, and this is published by Random House. Now, I'm gonna go a little speedy here because I haven’t much time left, folks. And I want you to get as many of these as you can. Next one is Pagans and Christians . Pagans and Christians . This book is worth its weight in gold. If you want to understand the early history of the church, and the antagonism between the early church, the early Christian church, and the pagan religions. Pagans and Christians , by Robin Lane Fox. Robin Lane Fox. Published by Knopf (K ‐ N ‐ O ‐ P ‐ F). Get it, read it. You won’t regret it. The next one is...that alarm you just heard going off, that is the bread maker. (laughs) The loaf of bread is done and I'm fixing to have a hot slice of bread with fresh butter on it as soon as I finish this broadcast, folks. Preparing for the Twenty ‐ first Century , Preparing for the Twenty ‐ First Century , by Paul Kennedy, published by Random House. Now, that’s a modern book about modern things ‐‐ you still need to read it. Next one is a very important book, printed in 1798. It has been reprinted by the Americanist Classics. The Americanist Classics, published by Western Islands, Boston & Los Angeles. You can find this book easily. It's called Proofs of a Conspiracy , by John Robinson A.M., 1798. Proofs of a Conspiracy , by John Robinson A.M., 1798. The Americanist Classics, published by Western Islands, Boston & Los Angeles. If 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"you didn’t get anything else I have ever told you, get that book and read it. Another one that's very important is called Time Bomb . Time Bomb . It will give you the roots of the Liberty Lobby and the spotlight and America Free Radio [sic], and will open your eyes on the Nazi influence in this country. Time Bomb , by Piller, published by Arco. Arco. And this is (laughs) very revealing. Another one is...well, I don’t have it in front of me so I'm not gonna risk misquoting it. This one is The New World Order . The New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies . This is called The New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies , by William T. Still, William T. Still. And who published this book? Let me see here, Huntington House Publishers. Published by Huntington House Publishers' Pick it up, read it. Remember, there are a lot of books called the The New World Order . That’s just one, and I'm going to give you another one with the same title here in a few minutes. The next one is En Route to Global Occupation . En Route to Global Occupation: A High ‐ Ranking Government Liaison Exposes the Secret Agenda of World Unification , by Gary H. Kah. Gary H. Kah, and this, also, is Huntington House Publishers. The next one is pretty good, called Dark Majesty . Now this author, Texe Marrs, has published a plethora of books about the coming New World Order. Unfortunately, he really laces it with his own religious view points, and that’s OK because he has a lot of hard facts in here. But it tends to turn some people off and they don’t want to read the books because of that. If you're a Christian, you will have no problem reading this book; if you're not, you may have some problem with the religious beliefs of Texe Marrs. But if you can struggle with that and get through it, it will open your eyes and you will get a lot of good facts from this book. Its called Dark Majesty by Texe Marrs, The Secret Brotherhood and the Magic of a Thousand Points of Light . You see, he understands this quite a bit, like I do, only I don’t try to hoist my religion off on the rest of you. I'm a Christian, but I'm a different kind of Christian. I'm a Christian only in that I believe in the ten commandments as given to Moses by God, and the actual words attributed to Christ, whether he lived or died, or was the son of God or was just a man walking on this Earth. I believe that what he said is the most profound utterances ever spoken on this earth, whether they were ever spoken or not, folks. And I try to live my life by the ten commandments and by those words that Christ is credited with having spoken. The next work is Satanic Voices: Ancient and Modern . Satanic Voices: Ancient and Modern , compiled by David Musa Pidcock. David Musa Pidcock. Now, this author is the head of the Islamic Party in Great Britain. So, again, you have his fundamental religious beliefs mixed in this book with a lot of cold, hard facts, which I have checked and double ‐ checked and they're absolutely true. So if you, again, like with the other book, if you can get past the religious viewpoint of the author and look at what the history of this thing is, from his viewpoint and the facts that he delivers in this book, then (laughs) believe me, you'll be way ahead of the game. It's published by Mustaqim which, I believe, is the Islamic Party in Great Britain. And Mustaqim publishes Islamic art and literature. Now, remember what I told you a long time ago. If you don’t want to read opposing viewpoints or books written by people who believe in different religious...or different gods than you do; if you don’t want to read something that was written by a blatant Communist, then I'm telling ya right now, you're going to be whipped in this war. You're gonna be beat down and enslaved in this war, because you won't know anything about your enemy, you won't really know what the truth is, because you’ll be stuck, held prisoner, in the dogma of your own beliefs. And I mean that, folks. A lot of us have been believing a lot of things for all of our lives that are absolute, total lies. And once you start your own research you’ll find that out. And you're gonna be probably as angry as I have been at times in my life. And you may do some stupid things like I have done at times in my life. Which is one reason why none of you should ever, ever put me up on a pedestal. Because I'm just like you. (laughs) I'm just like you. I'm not any different. And I may be a lot more human than most, because I've gotten in touch with something inside that lets me feel and express my anger and my emotions and things that most people aren’t in touch with. So when I'm angry, I scream and yell, but five minutes later it's all over with. (laughs) Don’t put me on a pedestal. I'll fall off immediately, and you will all be disappointed. So, if you don’t do it, nobody will be disappointed. The next book is called, The Unseen Hand . The Unseen Hand: An Introduction to the Conspiratorial View of History , by A. Ralph Epperson, my good friend who lives in Tucson, who’s going to be a guest on this program here in about a week or two. And were going to try to do, maybe three or four episodes of the Hour of the Time with A. Ralph Epperson. This book, The Unseen Hand , is an incredible piece of work and I highly recommend it. The next book is also by A. Ralph Epperson, and I've used this book extensively during our revelation of the Mystery Schools and Mystery Babylon in our series, our ongoing series. It’s called The New World Order . The New World Order , by A. Ralph Epperson. Get these books, read them. If you cant find them, just wait. He'll be on this show pretty soon, and we'll give you a phone number and an address and a price, and you can send off and get them directly from him. This next book is extremely revealing. In fact, anything that this author has ever written you should read. In fact there’s a center, a study center set up in Los Angeles called the Philosophical Society which was founded by Manly P. Hall. The name of the author, Manly P. Hall, 33rd degree Freemason. Anything that he's ever written, get it and read it. This particular book is called Freemasonry of the Ancient 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Egyptians . Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians . Another good one to read that he wrote is called, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry , and anything else that you can find that has been written by Manly P. Hall, get it and read it. Make sure you understand the symbology don’t get caught up in the exoteric bullshit, because that’s the way they hide the real meaning. Another one, because a lot of the Mystery traditions is wrapped up in what they call the Kaballah, which is the ancient the Jewish version of the Mystery Schools. And don’t get me wrong, folks. Not all Jews are involved in this, not all Catholics are involved in it, not all Protestants are involved in it, not all blacks, not all Arabs, not all whites, but some of every one of them are deeply involved in this. And they are the people who worship Lucifer. If you worship Lucifer, you can be a member, too. This book is called Judaica . Judaica: The Blackwell Dictionary of Judaica . This is The Blackwell Dictionary of Judaica , by Dan Cohn ‐ Sherbok. Dan Cohn ‐ Sherbok, and it's published by Blackwell, Blackwell Reference, printed in Great Britain by TJ Press, Pat Stone limited, Pat Stone, Cornwall, but you can still order this from any bookstore. The Blackwell Dictionary of Judaica , by Dan Cohn ‐ Sherbok. Make sure you get it, because a lot of the Kabalistic words needs definitions, and you can find them in this book. Next one is A Dictionary of Freemasonry . A Dictionary of Freemasonry: A Compendium of Masonic History, Symbolism, Rituals, Literature, and Myth . A Dictionary of Freemasonry , by Robert Macoy. Robert Macoy. This book is worth its weight in gold if you know how to, again, interpret the symbolism of the exoteric meaning [inaudible] the exoteric writing. Some of you already know what I'm talking about, some of you have no idea what I'm referring to, but you will find out once you get into this. Another book that’s worth its weight in gold is called The Mystery Religions . The Mystery Religions and Christianity . The Mystery Religions and Christianity , by Samuel Angus. Samuel Angus. Published by University Books. Published by University Books, The Mystery Religions and Christianity , by Samuel Angus. And we want to thank our member, Spencer. Thank you very much. Spencer supplied us with this volume. Next one's been around for a long time, but, again, it's worth its weight in gold. But you have to understand, again, the symbolism to read these books. A lot of these books were not meant for us to read and understand. They are meant for an adept, an initiate, to understand. This is A History of Secret Societies , published by Citadel.

A History of Secret Societies . Again, worth its weight in gold. The next one is The Occult Conspiracy . The Occult Conspiracy . Now, this book was written by someone who is in sympathy with the Secret Societies and may be a member, although I doubt, from reading this...it doesn’t sound like he is. But he is defiantly in sympathy with them. So be careful when you read this that you don’t get the wrong message, The Occult Conspiracy: Secret Societies, Their Influence and Power in World History , by Michael Howard. That’s Michael Howard, and this is published by Destiny Books, Rochester, Vermont. And the logo of Destiny Books is the Sun and the Moon. (laughs) That should tell you something. Next one is America's Secret Assignment ...excuse me, I'm wrong. America's Assignment with Destiny . There’s two books, and I had this confused with another one. The other one's called Americas Secret Destiny . Throw that one out. That’s total crap. (laughs) That is exoteric from the word \"go,\" all the way to the end. This one, though, you need to read, America's Assignment with Destiny , by Manly P. Hall, and you will not believe what your eyes are telling you that your brain is reading. For this is an incredible book. It has incredible admissions, and you will begin to understand certain things that happened in history that you could never understand before.

So pay attention, and remember, as always, as always, just because I'm giving you this series of Mystery Babylon doesn't mean that you're supposed to believe what I'm telling you blindly. That's why I gave you the bibliography last night. You've got to go out and find the truth from your own research, and I'm the only one who ever tells you that.

[reading from The New World Order , written by A. Ralph Epperson]: \"[Now] the Bible[, folks,] discusses of a being called Lucifer in both the Old and New Testaments...\" [William Cooper]: And we're going to be talking a lot about the Bible tonight because we have to look at this from every point of view. We've looked at it from the Mystery Schools. We've looked at it logically, we've looked at it historically. Now we're going to look at it from the Bible's point of view, but not strictly from the Bible's point of view. But you need to know this. \"The Bible discusses a being called Lucifer in both the Old and New Testaments. Other names for this creature are Satan, and the Devil. \"One of the first explanations of just who this being known as Lucifer is, is found in the Old Testament in a book written by the prophet Isaiah, who wrote around 740 B.C. He wrote that Lucifer was created 'full of wisdom,' and was 'perfect.' He was created the 'anointed cherub that covereth the throne of God,' and that he actually was 'upon the holy mountain of God.' He later 'corrupted [his] wisdom by reason of [his] brightness.' The Bible then records that God 'cast [him] to the ground.' \"Isaiah wrote this in Isaiah [chapter 14, verse 12]: 'How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations!'\" [William Cooper]: And, folks, this was the very first, very first recorded UFO sighting. If, indeed, it was a sighting at all. \"'For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also up on the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like The Most High.' \"Luke, a writer in the New Testament, records in Luke [chapter 10, verse 18], that Jesus said that he beheld 'Satan...as lightning fall from heaven.' Peter records in II Peter [chapter 2, verse 4] that God has 'spared not the angels...that sinned, but cast them down' as well. \"Paul, another New Testament writer, wrote this about Lucifer in II Corinthians [chapter 11, verse 14], in about 57 A.D.: 'And no marvel, for Satan [has] transformed into an angel of light.' And in II Thessalonians [chapter 2, verse 9], Paul wrote that Satan was capable of 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"working 'lying wonders.' \"[At] around 90 A.D., John, the author of the book known as Revelation, wrote in Revelation [chapter 12, verse 9], that Satan was a 'dragon.' \"Lucifer shows up in the original site of human habitation on earth, called the Garden of Eden. The creator God placed Adam, the first man (and later Eve, the first woman) in this garden, but told them that there were certain rules that they had to abide by. [And] these are spelled out in Genesis [chapter 2, verses 16 and 17]: 'And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree in the garden thou mayst freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die.' \"Later, Lucifer spoke through a serpent to Eve, but in reality to both men and women: 'Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent: We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden [the tree of the knowledge of good and evil] God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, lest ye die. \"'And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.' \"So, from the above information, it's possible to glean a little knowledge about the nature of Lucifer: \"1. He was cast down from heaven, because he desired to ascend directly into the seat of heavenly power, the throne of God. \"2. He is referred to as the 'son of the morning.' This appears to be a reference to Lucifer being similar to the sun, which also rises every morning. \"[3.] His desire [number three, his desire] is to sit on the north side of the mountain of God. \"[4.] Lucifer can deceive the world, [this is number four. Lucifer can deceive the world,] because he has been transformed into an 'angel of light.' \"[5.] [And five,] Lucifer can work 'lying wonders.' \"Now, with those basic understandings[, folks,] of Lucifer in place, it will be possible to examine the views of others about this fallen entity. However, not all agree with the picture of Lucifer being evil. [For] Albert Pike wrote [this]: '...there is no rebellious demon of Evil, or Principle of Darkness and in eternal controversy with God.' \"In fact, Mr. Pike believes that Lucifer was not a force of evil, but could be a force for good [and] he wrote this in Morals and Dogma :\" [William Cooper]: Which I forgot to give you yesterday in the bibliography. That's another one folks, write it down: Morals and Dogma , by Albert Pike. Morals and Dogma , by Albert Pike. He wrote this in Morals and Dogma : \"'For the Initiates [those initiated into the true secrets of Masonry] this is not a person, but a force, created for good, but which may serve for evil.' \"To further amplify that belief of Mr. Pike's, it becomes important to quote a letter that he wrote on July the 14th, 1889 to the 23 Supreme Councils of the world. Judging from the contents of this letter, it appears that Mr. Pike was attempting to tell the leaders of the various Supreme Councils all over the world that they were to know that Lucifer was the secret god of the Masons. This letter clearly indicates that he believed the position that Lucifer was a god who had come to earth for the good of mankind. [And] he wrote this: \"'That which we must say to the crowd is [presumably, Mr. Pike meant that the 'crowd' was all of the non ‐ Masons, [and] the public at large...[William Cooper: that which we must say to the crowd is]] We worship a God, but it is the God that one adores without superstition.' \"[So] it appears that on the purposes of this letter was to advise all of the top ranking Masons that they were to concoct a story that the Masons worshiped the 'traditional' God, so that none could ever accuse them of worshiping a cherub, a non ‐ god, by the name of Lucifer. In other words, they were to deny that Lucifer was their god whenever an outsider was smart enough to break through all of the secrets and figure it out.\" [William Cooper]: Well, of course, folks, they were sworn to secrecy! They would have to deny anything about the true secrets of their 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"order. I mean, what kind of logic is this? That's plain as the nose on your face. You must understand that when you ask a Mason a question about Freemasonry, he's going to tell you a lie because he is sworn to secrecy. And he is sworn by blood oaths. And I know that, by the time they reach the 32nd degree, they taken at least 32 different oaths swearing them to secrecy. Minimum. So, you should know this already. [William Cooper]: Now, let's continue, but I'm going to go back and read that part over. \"It appears that one of the purposes of this letter was to advise all of the top ranking Masons that they were to concoct a story that the Masons worshiped the 'traditional' God, so that none could ever accuse them of worshiping a cherub, a non ‐ God' by the name of Lucifer. [William Cooper: It's very important.] In other words, they were to deny that Lucifer was their god whenever an outsider was smart enough to break through all of the secrets and figure it out.\" [William Cooper]: As I, and many others, have done. As A. Ralph Epperson has done. \"So the secret inside the Masonic order is that Lucifer is their secret god. Any non ‐ Mason today who attempts to explain any of their Masonic friends or relatives that this is the secret inside the Lodge, will be met with an instantaneous denial. Every Mason, whether they know the secret of the Lodge or not, will obviously deny the accusation [because they must]. \"Mr. Pike continued: 'You may repeat it to the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees ‐‐ The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.'\" [William Cooper]: You see, Albert Pike at that time was at the head of all the lodges of Freemasonry of the world, and at the head of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in the United States of America. \"Here, Mr. Pike seems to indicate that it is the 30th, 31st and 32nd degrees that are to be taught the 'Luciferian doctrine.' The direct evidence that the honorary 33rd degree is formally taught that Lucifer is the Great Architect of the Universe will be presented later. But, here Pike seems to say that that lesson is to be taught at an earlier degree. 'If Lucifer were not God, would Adonay [the God of the Christians and the Jews] and his priests calumniate [which is] [defined as spreading false and harmful statements about or to slander] him?'\" [William Cooper]: Would they calumniate him? \"Pike makes two incredible statements about Lucifer: \"1. He is considered to be a god! and \"2. The priests, and the rabbis, have it all backwards, and are all slandering his name. \"As has been illustrated, the Bible states that Lucifer is nothing more than a fallen cherub. He's not a god. Yet Mr. Pike clearly states that Lucifer is a god! [William Cooper: Now, how can that be?] \"And secondly, those who claim that he is the 'wicked one' are 'slandering' him. Those individuals have it all wrong! \"Mr. Pike continued: '...the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay;' \"Adonay, also spelled [William Cooper: well, in the first place here, it's spelled A ‐ D ‐ O ‐ N ‐ A ‐ Y, then he says 'Adonai,' also spelled A ‐ D ‐ O ‐ N ‐ A ‐ I], is the Hebrew word for God. To show that Pike was referring to the God of the Bible, he wrote this in his book entitled Morals and Dogma : '...Adonai, the rival of Bal and Osiris.' [William Cooper]: In other words, Adonay is Typhon. That's an aside from me, folks, that's not written in this book. But as you been listening to this series I've given you, you know that Adonay, if this is true, if he's the rival of Baal and Osiris, then he is Typhon. \"As has been illustrated, Osiris is the sun ‐ god, as the sun has been shown as a symbol of Lucifer. Adonai is the 'rival' of Lucifer, both in the Bible, and in the writings of Albert Pike. 'But Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.' \"[And] here once again Mr. Pike writes that Lucifer and Adonay are rivals, and that the religious world has it all backwards: Lucifer is the 'good [guy],' and Adonay is the God of 'evil and darkness.' 145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"\"(The author would like to interrupt the narrative to make an observation...)\" [William Cooper]: And this observation is being made by A. Ralph Epperson, not me. He wrote this book. \"(That authenticity of that letter by Albert Pike that was just quoted has been questioned by a variety of writers. It has been reported that Mr. Pike made these comments in an 'encyclical' hand carried to a meeting of [the] 23 Supreme Councils of the world on July 14th, 1889 in Paris, France. \"This author [meaning A. Ralph Epperson] is willing to concede that the only evidence for the contents of this 'encyclical' consists of it being quoted in a book written by Frenchman named A. C. de la Rive entitled La Femme et l' Enfant dans la Ranc ‐ Maconnerie Universelle .)\" [William Cooper]: I'm not a French speaker, folks, so that's the best I could do. My tongue doesn't do those things, or at least I haven't practiced to make my tongue do those things. \"(That title, translated from French to English means 'The Woman and Child in Universal French Masonry.' A copy of that page that contains that quote, and the cover of the book has been supplied to this author [meaning A. Ralph Epperson] by a concerned researcher who had someone locate the book in France for him and make copies of the pertinent pages. \"The author has read another book that contains the English translation of that 'encyclical.' That book is entitled Occult Theocracy and was written in 1933 by Edith Starr Miller. She cites the book by Mr. De La Rive as her source. \"She obviously believed that the letter was true and contained the actual thoughts of Mr. Albert Pike.)\" [William Cooper]: He said it in so many other places, including his own book, Morals and Dogma , that I also believe that the letter is true. And now I'm speaking as myself, William Cooper. \"(In other words, [going back to A. Ralph Epperson's words, in other words,] the only source of the letter is a Frenchman who quotes it in his book and not Mr. Albert Pike himself. It must be assumed that Mr. Pike, if we were alive today and was asked whether the letter was his, would deny that he ever wrote such an 'encyclical,' whether or not he not he had written it [William Cooper: because he must be sworn to maintain the secrets]. But, the reader is admonished to remember that if he did indeed worship Lucifer, and wrote the 'encyclical,' he would certainly have to deny it.' So that answer would tell the researcher nothing. \"It is the contention of this writer, [A. Ralph Epperson,] and others who are attempting to decipher the secret symbols of the Masonic Order, that a small percentage of the Masons know that all of the symbols inside the Lodge refer to Lucifer.)\" [William Cooper]: And I am one of those who believe this, folks. My research has shown it to be absolutely true, and I can prove it. And I've already, I've already, given you direct quotes from many Freemasons that already prove it. \"(And it must remembered that these Masons must of necessity do all that they can to deny any [any revelation of any of the secrets of the Lodge]. \"And certainly anyone today who believes that the contents of the letter are a fraud would do all that they could to discredit anyone who said that the thoughts were the actual thoughts of Pike. \"However, this writer [meaning A. Ralph Epperson] is of the opinion that Mr. Pike did indeed worship Lucifer, and is not basing that conclusion on just this one letter. Notice that Mr. Pike has written elsewhere that he considered Lucifer to be the secret god of the Masonic Lodge.)\" [William Cooper]: And I, William Cooper, also found that to be true. Not only in one or two letters, but in many instances. \"(So, it is not essential to this writer [A. Ralph Epperson's position] that this 'encyclical' be proven to be valid. It is the author's contention that there is ample evidence from other sources, including from Masons other than Mr. Pike, that the secret god inside the Masonic lodges is Lucifer [William Cooper: and I wholeheartedly concur with Mr. Epperson]. That evidence is available to anyone who cares to locate it.) \"But there is another Mason who knows that Lucifer is the 'good god' of a particular segment of the Masons. Pike's fellow 33rd degree Mason, Manly P. Hall, also felt that this 'god' was a 'god of good.' He wrote in his book entitled The Secret Teachings of All Ages : 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"\"'Sun worship played an important part in nearly all the early pagan Mysteries. The Solar Deity...was slain by wicked ruffians, who personified the evil principle of the universe. By means of certain rituals and ceremonies, symbolic of purification and regeneration, this wonderful god of good was brought back to life and became the savior of His people.' [(emphasis by Epperson)] \"This 'god' who came back to life is not the Jesus of the Bible, because Mr. Hall refers to him as 'The Solar Deity.' He is referring to the death and resurrection of Osiris, covered in detail in the Masonic rituals.\" [William Cooper]: And I've already, I've already relayed to you who Osiris really is. In fact, in this series of the Mystery Religion, I've proven it time and time and time again. \"[But] Manly P. Hall has further identified Lucifer as the god of some of his fellow Masons. He has written this in his book entitled The Lost of Keys of Freemasonry [It's one of the books that I gave you last night, folks]: \"'When the Mason learns the key to the warrior of the block is the proper application of the dynamo of the living power, he has learned the mystery of his Craft. The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.' \"Mikhail Bakunin, the Russian anarchist, also addressed this question of evil and good gods. He wrote: 'The Evil One is the satanic revolt against divine authority, revolt in which we see the fecund [defined as being fertile] germ of all human emancipations, the revolution. \"'Socialists recognize each other by the words \"In the name of the one to whom the great wrong has been done.\" \"'Satan[, folks, is] the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes men ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge.' [William Cooper]: You see, I've been telling you all along that Socialists and the Mystery Religion of Babylon are the same, the same, the same, and now in his book A. Ralph Epperson has proven it. \"That thought that Lucifer was a 'good spirit, to whom a great wrong' has been done, is the basic thought that holds the New Age together, according to Texe Marrs, the author of two major books on the subject. [And] he has written: 'Many New Agers commend Lucifer because by tempting Eve he enabled man to evolve toward enlightened knowledge and godhood.'\" [William Cooper]: Remember, I told you that, with the gift of intellect, man will develop technology that will make him God? They're working feverishly in laboratories now to uncover the secret of immortal life. \"Mr. Marrs discusses the thoughts of a leader in a mystical organization called the Stelle Group [William Cooper: How many times have I mentioned that? The Stelle Group.], named Eklal Kueshana. He writes...this New Age leader says that: \"'Lucifer is the head of a secret Brotherhood of Spirits...the Brotherhood is named after Lucifer because the great Angel Lucifer has been responsible for the abolishment of Eden in order that men could begin on the road to spiritual advancement.'\" [William Cooper]: Lars Hanson was reared in The Stelle Group. Lars Hanson was reared in The Stelle Group. Tom Valentine was a member of The Stelle Group. Tom Valentine wrote a book called The Life and Death of Planet Earth . Get it, read it, folks. [William Cooper]: Tom Valentine was associated with the Communist party. Now he's a member of the Liberty Lobby, which came right out of the old German Nazi Bund. They used to sing the Horst Wessel song at the beginning of their meetings. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Why do you think every time somebody calls Tom Valentine to ask him about Freemasonry and their complicity in the conspiracy? He covers it up and hangs up on the person as quickly as possible and denies that there's any complicity of Freemasonry. [William Cooper]: Now, this makes me a little hot under the collar. I've got to cool down a little bit, so we're going to take a break. Folks, don't go away, I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: none) Well, folks, I needed that little break. I will tell you right now, Tom Valentine has been attacking me for years because he knows that I know who he is and what he's about, that I know the origins of the Liberty Lobby, that I know their message is that our government is no 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"good. It doesn't work, that it's turned against us and it's all lies. Where it's the people who are in these secret societies who have turned against us who are delivering that message to us to get us to voluntarily overthrow or get rid of our own government, the only government in the history of the world that is ever set man free! And I'm the only one who let's you know this. It's not our government, it's not the Constitution, it's not the Bill of Rights, it's not the structure. It's the secret societies. It's the Tom Valentines. It's the Bo Gritzes. It's all of these people who belong to Freemasonry and the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross, and the Knights Templar, and the sovereign and military Order of the Knights of Malta, and the order of St. John of Jerusalem and many more. Many more. Socialists, international socialism under many, many different names. You see, folks, you see? (laughs) The senator was right. Senator McCarthy was absolutely right, he was correct. He just didn't know the proper name. He thought he was ferreting out Communism...he wasn't. You see, if he understood that what I understand, then he would have survived the attacks of the very people he was trying to ferret out, who owned the media that turned against him and destroyed him. Hollywood, who turned against him, destroyed him through manipulating the opinion of the public. See, Communism, folks, is just a word. It's another bugaboo enemy. (laughs) The real enemy, folks, is Mystery Babylon. I could never say what I said tonight before, because if I had, it would have been misinterpreted. I had to have independent verification that The Stelle Group worshiped Lucifer before I could reply legitimately to attacks upon me by Tom Valentine. Because if I had told you what I know without independent verification, all of you would have turned against me as being a poor sport or some other bullshit. It's a real load off my chest to be able to deliver that message to you. I can tell you that right now. Real load off my chest. Let me continue, and remember, this is chapter nine of A. Ralph Epperson's book, The New World Order. [continuing reading from The New World Order ]: \"So there's a basic disagreement about the nature of Lucifer, also known as Satan or the devil. The Bible depicts him as a force for evil, and Mr. Pike, and others, picture him as a force for good. \"But the connection between Lucifer and the Ancient Mysteries needs to be further amplified. The Mysteries had a purpose: to create a super man...\" [William Cooper]: Where have you heard that before? Hitler said it, and they're working in secret laboratories right now toward the same goal. \"The Mysteries had a purpose: to create a super man, one capable of understanding the true nature of the universe, and to worship the 'true' god. W. L. Wilmshurst, a Mason, wrote these thoughts in his book entitled The Meaning of Masonry : \"'This ‐‐ the evolution of man into supermen ‐‐ was always the purpose of the ancient Mysteries, and the real purpose of modern Masonry is, not the social and charitable purposes to which so much attention is paid, but the evolution of those who aspire to perfect their own nature, and transform it into more god ‐ like quality.'\" [William Cooper]: Indeed, I say as an aside here what a Freemason said to a friend of mine who was his son. He said, “Son, if you are not one of us, you are nothing.” And, of course, the son was not one of them, and to his great credit, has never become one of them. \"[W. L. Wilmshurst] amplified this thought a little later in his book: 'Man who has sprung from the earth [meaning that he was not created by a creator God] and developed through the lower kingdoms of nature to his present rational state, has yet to complete his evolution by becoming a god ‐ like being and unifying his consciousness with the Omniscient ~ to promote which is and always has been the sole aim and purpose of all Initiation.' \"[And he goes on:] 'No higher level of attainment is possible than that in which the human merges in the Divine consciousness and know as God knows.'\" [William Cooper]: (laughs) What have I been telling you all this time, folks? \"So, just as Satan tempted mankind with the ability to know good and evil themselves just like God, without His assistance, now the Masons are teaching that they too could become a god through an initiation into the Ancient Mysteries. \"John Anthony West, in his book Serpent in the Sky , wrote this in support of Mr. Wilmshurst's statement: \"'Egypt started with the concept of divine attributes within man. The gods are not brought down to earth; rather man is raised to the 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"gods.' \"Others besides the above mentioned Masons, like Louis Feuerbach, have joined the discussion with similar thoughts. He was a nineteenth century philosopher and a hero of the Communists like Karl Marx. In fact, Frederick Engels, the co ‐ worker with Karl Marx during the time Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto [William Cooper: as a hired writer hack], wrote this about his friend: \"'All the Communists of 1845 were followers of [Louis] Feuerbach...' \"The reason the Communists supported the ideas of Feuerbach is apparent when the student reads his writings. [For] he wrote: 'Man alone is our God, our father, our judge, our redeemer, our true home, our law and our rule, the Alpha and the Omega of our life and our political, moral, public and domestic activity. There is no salvation, save through the medium of man.' \"John Denver, the well known popular singer, has adopted this same philosophy about his divinity. He has been quoted as saying this after his new conversion: 'It's the single, most important experience of my life ‐‐ I can do anything. One of these days, I'll be so complete I won't be human; I'll be a god.'\" [William Cooper]: It's the same thing that's taught in the Mormon church. If a married couple produced many children and conformed to the teachings of the church, then when they die, they will be gods and they will be given a planet of their own, and they will continue their reproduction, only they will be souls and they will populate the planet and will be the gods of the planet. [William Cooper]: What crap! What absolute crap! Where do these people get their egos? \"I'll be a god!\" Yeah, sure you will. (laughs) If you guys are all gods, then how come you still got to pay your bills? How come you get sick? And how come you got to go to the doctor? And if you go to the doctor, what does that make the doctor if you're god? Huh? [William Cooper]: You're a bunch of fools. You're blithering idiots. You've lost your mind, your egos have run away with the rest of you and you're going to die like everyone else. And you're going to find, like everyone else, what really happens when people die. And as far as I know, no one on this Earth really knows, or is likely to know, 'til it happens to them. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. \"Mr. Hall, the Mason, stated a similar thought when he wrote this in his book entitled Lectures on Ancient Philosophy : \"'We may study the star intellectually, but we have never attained consciousness until we are the star.' \"But this idea that man could become a god is not new. The Bible anticipated it, and Isaiah wrote about it back in 741 B.C. This is what he wrote in Isaiah [chapter 43, verse 10]: 'Thus saith the Lord...understand that I am He: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.' \"And once again, in Isaiah [chapter 45, verse 5]: 'I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me...' [William Cooper]: And remember, all the Roman emperors declared themselves god, and they all died like every other man, and died (some of them) by the assassin's sword or knife. God, yeah, mm ‐ hmm. Boy, you guys just take the cake, I'll tell you. How you can meet and throw that bologna around at each other and swallow it and pump each other up. To believe that you're gods or going to be gods is beyond my understanding. \"The Bible teaches that there is but one God, and that mankind has no possibility of sharing His godhead. \"One who apparently has not believed those statements in the Bible is Shirley MacLaine, who has become a spokesman for the position that man can become a god. She has written several books on the subject of her support of the New Age. (Newsweek magazine described her as 'The New Age evangelist.') [And] she wrote the following statement in her book entitled Dancing in the Light : '...we are part of God...' and this elsewhere in the same book: '...if one says audibly I am God, the sound vibrations literally align the energies of the body to a higher attunement.'\" [William Cooper]: Yeah, I bet it does. Yep, yep, I bet the insanity molecules take over every portion of the body, and you really all feel great until you have to go pay your rent, or you catch the flu, or somebody just knocks the crap out of you to bring you back to reality. Which is exactly what should happen when you do those kinds of things. What's wrong with just living life peacefully with other people and enjoying what we have? What's the big thing that you have to become God? And I'll tell ya right now, you never will. You might as well just....well, never mind. If you want to be God, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. You're deceiving yourself, and that's OK as long as you don't hurt anyone else. \"If each man is a god, mankind is capable of making decisions for their own welfare. Each man has complete control of his decision ‐ 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"making, according to Miss MacLaine. In fact, man's control is extended into areas few have ever claimed for mankind. [And] these are the thoughts of Miss MacLaine: \"'I think we choose to be together...We choose our parents, and I think the parents choose the children they want to have before they ever come into an incarnation.'\" [William Cooper]: Tell that to an abused child. Tell that to a child who's raised by drunken, miserable, stinking parents who don't give a damn about the child. Tell that to all those people who know that that's total false, irresponsible, ramblings of an insane maniac. And you know what they say when they're confronted with this? They say you agreed to it in a previous life, and that you're, you're paying off your karmic debt. You see, they have a rationalization for everything, and it's just more bullshit. More lies, more crap. \"She went further to record another strange thought, when she wrote this: '...there is no such thing as reality, only perception.'\" [William Cooper]: Well, Shirley, let me tap you on the jaw with my fist, and then you tell me that there's no reality. Of course, I don't really want to do that, folks, but that's just a way to bring her to her senses. If it were legal, I might try it. Might try it. Might wake her up. Might show her that her perception is only reality. (laughs) \"One can only wonder where Miss MacLaine got these bizarre thoughts from. Several clues that can assist the student in understanding her have been given by either her own revelations or some articles that have appeared about her in the media. \"In her book entitled Out on a Limb , she wrote about her meetings with her married lover in her apartment.\" [William Cooper]: (laughs) This god is breaking up somebody's marriage, and she's meeting with her married lover in her apartment. \"She commented that he looked at her shelf of books on, amongst other subjects: 'Marxists theory,' including a 'biography of Karl Marx.'\" [William Cooper]: It was wrong with that [sic], I have those books in my library and many more. Many more. But knowing, knowing Shirley MacLaine, and folks, I do, knowing this scatterbrained twit, when she has books on Marxists theory, including a barred biography on Karl Marx, you can bet that she's a Socialist. And of course, she is. \" Parade magazine of December 18th, 1988 had an article on Miss MacLaine which it revealed that her den had 'lots of framed pictures: Shirley with...Fidel Castro, and with [Communist] Nikita Khrushchev [amongst others.]' The magazine reported how Shirley and her lover: 'talked about Democratic ‐ Socialist principles and how it was possible to have them both at the same time if the rich would only share their wealth more.' \"Elsewhere in her book, she wrote about how much of a hypocrite she was when she added this contradictory statement [and they all do]: '...wanted to talk to him...about how I had made a lot of money and that it made me feel elite in a world that was broke to know I could buy just about anything I wished for.'\" [William Cooper]: Just like Jane Fonda, who's been pushing for gun control for years, who was stopped by law enforcement officers on the freeway and her car was found to contain many pistols and weapons, firearms. Hypocrites and liars. \"However, nowhere in her book did she say that she had freely donated any of her own wealth to the relief of the poor. Apparently she believes that the Communist ideas about wealth sharing are acceptable only [if] she does not have to share her wealth like she wants the other rich to do.\" [William Cooper]: You see, most rich purport to be Socialist but, in actual practice, none of them really are. None of them would give away their wealth to the poor, ever. Yet, they pretend to be liberal, Socialist, Marxist. In reality, they demonstrate exactly the opposite. They're liars and hypocrites. For the whole Communist, Socialist idea is for the little people, you and I, who are to be their slaves in the New World Order. \"Miss MacLaine has since gone on a nationwide tour promoting her newfound religious views to the public. Newsweek magazine reported in 1987 that she had made a great deal of money explaining her new thoughts to others: 'Since MacLaine began her tour in... [1987,] more than 10,000 people in 15 cities have paid $300 admission fee.'\" [William Cooper]: Well, you know me, folks. I have absolutely nothing against that. If she could have got $1000 a head admission fee, that would be OK with me. 150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"\"[Now,] 10,000 times $300 equals 3 million dollars.\" [William Cooper]: I still have no complaint with that. This is the United States of America. If somebody wants it, give it to them. If they want to pay it, if they're that stupid, that's fine with me. I believe that people should be giving somebody something though, but I also believe that if they're stupid enough to pay it, then they should be taken. That's how you learn. And a lot of people would disagree with me, but I'm sorry folks, I'm sorry. That's what I believe. \"Obviously, Shirley's tours have proven to be both popular and lucrative. The Newsweek article on her seminar mentioned a little of what she teaches in them. The following are a few of her comments: \"'The Earth is moving off its axis,' she says, and only the 'collective consciousness' of mankind can right it. For the spiritually inclined, 'a window of light' will appear on those days [August 16th and 17th, 1987] that MacLaine says will 'allow us to rise to a higher plain of cosmic understanding.'\" [William Cooper]: Pure bullshit. Pure crap. Pure New Age mesmerism, if you will, for nothing happened on those dates. \"'Evangelist' MacLaine became 'Doctor' MacLaine when she reported some of her new cures for two of the world's most serious problems: AIDS and cancer of the abdomen. According to the Newsweek article, she told her audience: \"'They [or] [those who paid to hear her in the 15 cities of the tour] all got to hear MacLaine's pronouncements on such subjects as AIDS (she thinks sufferers are sick because they have been \"bereft of love necessary to sustain the balance\" of health); and cancer (for cancer of the abdomen, she advises \"putting patients in a yellow room because yellow is the color 'frequency' of that part of the body.\")'\" [William Cooper]: More New Age mesmerism bullshit crap. \"And to think her 'patients' only have to pay $300 for such wisdom! \"But 'Doctor' MacLaine is not as dumb as one might think. The Newsweek article reported: '...everyone who attended had to sign waivers absolving the seminar's organizers from responsibility [from] psychological injury.' [William Cooper: How clever! How clever of Ms. MacLaine!] \"So someone in charge of arranging her seminars is aware that her ideas might cause psychological damage to those attending, and they have moved to protect her from malpractice lawsuits. \"Not not only was this 'New Age evangelist' making money on her personal lecture tours, she was also making money on her best selling books.\" [William Cooper]: Now, I don't know what's wrong with A. Ralph Epperson. I don't know why he's saying this because he purports to believe in the Constitution and the principles and ideals upon which this country was based. And there is nothing wrong with making money on anyone's personal lecture tours or on their books. And I can tell you right now, that A. Ralph Epperson makes money on his lecture tours and on his books and that's how he makes his living. So as far as I'm concerned, that is a partial discreditation of A. Ralph Epperson. \"As of July, 1987, her book entitled Out on a Limb , had sold 3 million copies, and her other major seller, Dancing in the Light , had sold 2.2 million.\" [William Cooper]: Could he be jealous? Is it possible that A. Ralph Epperson is jealous of Shirley MacLaine's ability to sell books? \" Time magazine reported that her 'five books on self ‐ exploration and self ‐ promotion have run to more than 8 million copies.'\" [William Cooper]: Now, to me that's admirable. If someone can write something that is so desirable by 8 million people that it sells 8 million copies, I don't care what they're writing about. That's admirable. She's providing an income for herself, her family and people are obviously buying her books because they want them. Therefore, she's supplying them with a service, whether it's bullshit or not, it doesn't matter. That's the American way, folks. That's what it's all about. There was a lot of people back in the early part of the century who hated automobiles, and therefore, Henry Ford was the devil. But he sold an awful lot of them, and when [sic] he came under the criticism of a lot of people for doing it. [William Cooper]: Sorry folks, that's the American way. As far as I'm concerned, what A. Ralph Epperson is spouting in these few sentences here is Socialism. And I admire him for his research and what he's done, and I know that he makes his living selling books and 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"lecturing. And for him to spout the Socialist attitude when he is doing the same thing is not acceptable. And he is a friend of mine and I will certainly bring this to his attention. You know, I read this book a long time ago and I had forgotten that he had said these things, but I will certainly bring this to his attention. In fact, we may talk about it on the air when he's a guest of the show, and he will be a guest of the show very shortly. So, you can look forward to some kind of explanation of this. \"[He says] it appears that selling the New Age religion can be very profitable!\" [William Cooper]: Well, Barnum and Bailey was very profitable and it was all an illusion, just like the New Age religion. \"But, in summary, perhaps the most cogent comment on the battle between the New [Agers] and the Christians was made by Nesta Webster in her book entitled Secret Societies : \"'The war now begins between the two contending principles: the Christian conception of man reaching up to God, and the secret society...conception of man as God, needing no revelation from on high, and no guidance but the law of his own nature. \"'And since that nature is in itself divine, all that springs from it is praiseworthy, and those acts usually regarded as sins are not to be condemned.' [William Cooper]: You heard me say before that in the New World Order the law will be: Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. And it will. \"The battle lines are drawn between those who believe in a creator God, and those who believe than man can become god. These are the two opposing positions. And the battle between them[, dear listeners,] has [most certainly] begun.\" [William Cooper]: Now, don't get too upset for my criticism of the few paragraphs that A. Ralph Epperson wrote condemning Shirley MacLaine's ability to write books and lecture and bring in a lot of money. For I am sure that in his zeal, which many of us get carried away with, in his zeal to condemn the worship of Lucifer and the secret societies, he carried it a little too far. We'll bring it up when he's a guest on the show, for I am a little curious about it myself. But I haven't jumped off the edge...let's put it that way. Good night, and may God bless you all.

The only hour that ever was, or ever will be, for during this time you will decide your future and, thus, our collective futures. I'm your host, William Cooper. (William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation) If you are one of those who have been engrossed and have been following our series on the Mystery Schools ‐‐ the religion, the ancient religion of Mystery Babylon ‐‐ you are going to love tonight's program. And, once again, it's going to be proof that I have been right all along. So, stay tuned, folks. Don't go away. (opening music: The Rose , performed by unknown artist) Everybody look back, in that corner at the far side of the room, where it's real dark, behind that chair. I'm going to turn on a very, very bright light, and I want you all to watch the cockroaches scatter. For tonight, I'm going to read, verbatim, to you from a book that we found on a dusty shelf, far back in the rear of a used bookstore, that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that what I've been revealing to you in the segment ‐‐ the many segments ‐‐ of the series, entitled the Mystery Schools, on this program the Hour of The Time has been not only true, but right on target, and the first time that this information has ever been exposed in its entirety to the people of the world. Now, had you better go to the used bookstores in your cities and you'd better get there before the cockroaches get there, because I tell you now, they know we are searching for proof and that we are digging for the evidence that we will use in the future to hang them by their own rope. You need to get there first and buy any and every book that is concerned with any and every secret society, mystery religion or cult that you can find. If you don't understand them and if you don't want to use them to help us expose these people, then send those books to us, because we will put them to the best use. I'm holding in my hand an old faded...what use to be red, hard ‐ backed, covered book ‐‐ it's almost orange now because it's faded with age ‐‐ entitled Fundamental Laws: 68th Convocation . On the front of the cover is some of the symbology of the Mystery Schools. There is a rope representing the snake eating its own tail, also known as the Magic Circle. Within this Magic Circle, there is a triangle, actually three triangles, one within the other. Within the triangles, there's the symbol of the skull and bones; there is the symbol of wings around the world; there's the symbol of the ark, the anchor and the three letters T ‐ R ‐ Y beneath the three triangles. This is the verbatim written report, published 1916, ladies and gentlemen, that I'm going to read to you from: \" Fundamental Laws: A Report of the 68th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order . Giving a resume of the proceedings of the Convocation, together with most of the lectures that were delivered during this time of the Convocation, by the several delegates present. Also a report of the work of Ancient Initiation in the Grove of Osiris as especially prepared for the occasion.\" Below that is the symbol of a triangle with three stone steps, representing the three degrees of initiation. Up on the top step is a cross, in the center of which is a rose. And beneath the triangle, again, the three letters, T ‐ R ‐ Y. This is copyrighted, 1916, published by The Philosophical Publishing Company. Allentown, Pennsylvania, for the Members of the Rose Cross Order. On the next page is a roll of honor. One of the names on here stands out and almost knocked me over when I saw it, for the name is Lars Hansen. Now it is not the Lars Hansen that we've discussed on this show, and we're going to look it to find out if this was his father, or 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"grandfather, or great ‐ grandfather ‐‐ could have been either one of the three ‐‐ but we will find out, believe me. We know Lars Hansen's parents were members of the Mystery School and, in particular, the Metternich Stelle Group, where Lars Hansen was reared. [reading from Fundamental Laws: A Report of the 68th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order : \"In explanation of the contents of this book [and I'm reading verbatim from the introduction, 'In Explanation': In explanation of the contents of this book], it is to be stated that these articles do not give the INNER work of the Rose Cross Order but simply the outer, the public teachings. [William Cooper]: Now, you'll remember in the Mystery School series I taught you about the exoteric and the esoteric. What you're going to get in this book ‐‐ because they never publish the esoteric anywhere, it's always hidden in symbology, but there are incredible admissions in this book that you will hear in the exoteric. Reading again, verbatim: \"The Illuminati and its Soul Science work may be called the child of the Rose Cross Order. Years ago it was found that where there was one person who desired to follow the work with heart and soul, in other words, who was willing to LIVE the life as taught by the Order, there were an hundred others who desired teachings from the Order but who were not willing to dedicate their lives to the Sublime Work.\" [William Cooper]: Now, I break from this for a moment to remind you that...I have previously stated that the fraternity of Freemasons, The Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross, The Sovereign and Military Order of the Knights of Malta, The Knights Templars, the Mormon Church, all of these...the Illuminati, the Order, the Skull and Bones, are all the same organization. And what you have just heard is the first admission of that fact. And you are going to hear more as I progress. And remember, I am reading this right out of their own publication, a hardbound book, published by The Philosophical Publishing Company in Allentown, Pennsylvania, specifically for the Rose Cross Order. Continuing: \"These thousands had to be taken care of, and as a result, the Illuminati and its Soul Science work was born. \"When, in April, [now, that's April of 1916, folks, April of 1916. Remember that. When, in April,] the order went forth to the brethren, that Sacred Convocation was to be held, all delegates were requested to prepare articles on Soul Science so that regular lecture sessions could be held. The lectures that follow are the result. All these lectures were given in open session and are to considered as Soul Science work, though in entire harmony with the teachings of the Rose Cross Order. \"The work of the Rose Cross Order as given to its students can never be published. It is a secret, sacred work between teacher and student.\" [William Cooper]: Let me read that again for you: \"It is a secret, sacred work between teacher and student.\" \"It is a Soul Training, an inner Initiation, and such work continues until the student has reached Initiation, after which he is called upon to attend a Convocation, and at which time the degree work is conferred upon him, but the inner work always precedes the outer work, as the outer work is only a bond, binding together the Brotherhood. \"Thus a word in explanation. Many, having heard of the Great Order and its work, and actually knowing nothing of its inner work, have, ignorantly or with fraudulent intent, established so ‐ called Rose Cross bodies, and these bodies, knowing nothing of the true work of the Rose Cross, have nothing but a Ritualistic initiatory rite or degree work. \"We would refer all seekers to authorities on the Rose Cross and on Initiation, and they will then find that the TRUE Rose Cross is actually a School of Spirituality, with a degree ceremonial Initiation as the climax.\" [William Cooper]: And this is signed by the Hierophant of the Order. In the preface: \"Early in the summer, instructions were received from the Hierarchies to call the Inner Circle of the Rose Cross Order into session, and thus to fitly celebrate the 68th year of the Rose Cross Order in America. \"Orders were immediately issued to those who have the privilege of attending this Convocation, and on June the 1st [1916] the Convocation was called to order, and the preliminary lectures were started. \"At this Convocation all delegates were instructed to prepare and to deliver articles which should have a bearing on the conditions of the 154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"present day and which should be the means of helping humanity. \"However, because of the limited amount of time at the disposal of those who could attend, only a few were enabled to prepare such lectures, with the result that there were not as many lectures delivered as might have been had the delegates had more time at their disposal. \"But even so, there were from two to three lectures each day, and most of these lectures will be found in this present volume, though many of the lectures cannot be given in book form, as they were only delivered as from teacher to those of the Inner Circle. \"From the beginning of the month until the day of the thirteenth there were lectures in the Assembly Hall which had been built in 1910 for the express purpose of holding these yearly Convocations, but on the thirteenth, there were no lectures, as all of the day was required for making the preparations necessary in order that the Ancient Mysteries might be given to the delegates in a form of Symbolism, consisting of three degrees. \"I can do no better than to give the article prepared by Grace K. Morey, of Buffalo, N. Y., the Secretary of the Rose Cross Sacred College, for the Buffalo, N. Y., papers, and which appeared in the 'Buffalo Express' July 16th, 1916.\" [William Cooper]: This is entitled Ancient Mysteries of Egypt Given in an Initiation of Three Degrees. Pay close attention, folks, for what you are going to hear now confirms much of what I have been revealing to you in the series on the Hour of the Time, known as the Mystery Schools. Quoting from the book once again: \"Under the authority of the Rose Cross Order founded in America in 1858 prominent delegates of the Order were gathered in the most remarkable conclave held during the last 5000 years, the publication of whose records now opens to the world, the connection of Egypt in her ages of true religion, power and glory, with the Mystic Seal of the United States, whose Heraldric symbolism declaring the mighty destiny of America, has, until now only been known to a limited number.\" [William Cooper]: Not anymore. \"At 'Beverly Hall' in the beautiful Tohickon valley about four miles from the town of Quakertown, men and women of all ranks of life, and from all parts of the world, high Masons, and members of the Eastern Star, physicians, teachers, authors, and members of all denominations inclusive of the Hebrew, all these assembled at the call of the Grand Master of the Rose Cross Order for the sixty ‐ eighth Convocation.\" [William Cooper]: And that should silence the cockroaches, who are now scurrying from the light, who say that they are not all one order. They are known as the Brotherhood, the Order, the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross, the fraternity of Freemasons and, of course, those of you have been listening know the rest. Reading again from the book: \"Some years ago R. Swinburne Clymer, author of the Philosophy of Fire, Ancient Mystic Oriental Masonry, The Rosicrucians; Their Teachings, Mysteries of Osiris, Soul Science and Immortality, and over thirty other works, bought a mountainous tract of land, and on this was built 'Beverly Hall,' an Assembly Hall, press rooms and libraries, and chemical laboratory which, surrounded by orchards, vineyards and rose gardens, set in terraced lawns, presents with its Collie kennels and poultry plants, a splendid combination of the beautiful and the practical. \"To this has been added the Mystic, for in a secluded and wooded tract of fifty acres of this land, an artificial lake was made from a mountain stream, a throne room erected and other improvements made which would be needed for the Initiation of Neophytes in the Egyptian Mysteries. \"The Convocation was called to order on June first in the Assembly Hall, built over five years ago for that purpose, and the delivery of a series of lectures upon practical as well as Mystical subjects began and continued until the close of the Convocation. The delegates and teachers presented the lectures, which were followed by discussions upon the subjects of Eugenics, Scientific Motherhood, Code of Ethics for the Schools and home, Spiritual Christianity [that's a joke], Personal Hygiene, Diet and Health, Sin, Authority and Individuality, Jacob's Ladder, Initiation, Reincarnation, Soul Development, The Second Coming of the Christ, and the Mystic Significance of the seal of the United States. \"In the time of Solomon as in the time of the Egyptian Priesthood, no ceremony was ever held, unless the circle of Solomon, commonly called the Sacred Seal of Solomon, had been previously prepared, but since the fall of Egypt and of the Temple of Solomon, this seal has been practically unknown, except to a limited number of students of ancient religions and mysteries.\" [William Cooper]: Folks, the Seal of Solomon is not the six ‐ pointed star, which is on the flag of Israel. It is not the Seal of David or the Star 155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"of David. It is not the Seal of Solomon, as you will soon discover. \"During the first week in June, in the grove especially prepared for the dramatization of the Ancient Mysteries of Osiris, the Seal of Solomon, often called the Magic Circle, was especially built, and on June 11 the dedication of the Magic Circle took place in the presence of the delegates of the Rose Cross Order, sonic of whom were natives of Germany, England and Russia. This was in accordance with the system as practiced by the ancient Priests of Egypt and the Sanhedrin of the Temple of Solomon. \"On the night of June 13th the first section of the class, including those of the Order taking part in the Initiation, Assembled in the grove of Osiris, which was illuminated by electricity from a central power house especially prepared for the purpose, and the Initiation of the Ancient Mysteries of Egypt in three Degrees and six scenes. \"All students of the Ancient Mysteries and religions know that in the Temple of Solomon there were three Courts, the outer Court for the people being composed of seven hundred selected teachers and leaders. These were members of the First Degree, Illuminati, called also, seekers, travelers or soldiers. The middle Court, or members of the second Degree were seventy in number, and were supposed to be in the Hall of Meditation, and acted as mediators between the people and the inner Sanctuary. Above all was the Inner Court, or circle of the Seven Priests and the Master or High Priest, who were the teachers between God and man, mediators between the seen and Unseen. \"In the Egyptian Mysteries, the first Court was made up of the Royal youth of Egypt, and such students from foreign countries as desired to enter the Temple and Priesthood, and these, during probation, were often known as the 'Soldiers of the Priesthood,' as it was their duty while undergoing the preliminary training and tests to guard the Priesthood and its work even to the death. \"The second class corresponding to a Second Degree were those who had passed this test and who were in the Hall of Meditation, and purification, in preparation for the first vows, and the dedication of the body, mind, soul and spirit to God and the service of mankind. \"The third class called The Third Degree were those who had passed with credit the tests of the first degree, the purification of the second, as well as the various stages of development required of all students in the Halls of Meditation. \"In the Royal Third Degree, which took place in the Temple the Neophyte received the final instruction. After this came the final test in the beautiful ceremony of the death of the old life, the giving up of the body and its temptations and the raising of the slain Osiris or Spiritual body, by his faithful spouse Isis, the Soul, with the final Illumination. \"On the fifteenth of June, the first section of the representatives left 'Beverly Hall,' for their respective homes and the second section began to arrive for the preparatory lectures, and on the nineteenth of June the ceremonies were repeated so that all might witness the Initiation and take part in it so as to become members. \"So far as can be learned either through travel or history never before since the fall of Egypt and its Priesthood and the fall of the Temple of Solomon, has there ever been a grove, a lake to represent the Nile, a Magic Circle, or a Temple prepared, nor is it believed that anywhere in the world does there today exist such a Circle. \"Nearest to this, however, is Stone ‐ henge of the Druids of Britain, to which their descendants travel each year at a certain time to greet the Sun, and renew their vows. \"This is the first time, therefore, in 5000 years that any Order has attempted to build up this Sacred emblem under the stately oak, so that people of modern civilization might witness the beauties of the life and religion of the ancient people, whose teachings of individual soul development, made the glory of Egypt, the lost dreams of all Israel, the teachings of the Magi of Persia, all that was true in India, the splendid philosophy of Greece, the magnificence of the early Romans, the basis of pre ‐ Christian Ireland's great schools, as well as the familiar Holy Grail legends of Briton, Celt and Gaul. In this light of Brotherhood of man and Fatherhood of God was founded this great Republic foretold by Virgil, upon whose seal is set the Egyptian Pyramid, completed by the White stone of Spiritual Purification as the crown of the ages.\" [William Cooper]: It's time for our break, folks. Don't go away, for I'll be right back after this very short pause. (William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation) (break music: The Rose , performed by unknown artist) 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: In the winter, far beneath the bitter snow, lies the seed that, with the sun's love, becomes the rose. Only those of you who have listened to the full series of broadcasts on the Hour of the Time of the Mystery Schools will understand exactly what that means. And you will know and have a entirely different understanding of that song, which is beautiful, to say the least, but does not convey the message that many of you always thought you heard. [William Cooper]: You see, the Mystery Schools speak to each other is symbology, in a symbolic language that they have learned to use over the millennium to hide their real secrets, their real intent, their real work, which has always been from the beginning to re ‐ establish on this earth an ancient government ruled by a council of wise men, a benevolent despotism, a one ‐ world, totalitarian, Socialist government. Don't ever forget that, folks. If you love being free, the New World Order Utopia is not for you and it certainly is not for me. [William Cooper]: Continuing now from the book, entitled Fundamental Laws: , the publication of A Report of the 68th Convocation Of the Rose Cross Order , during which they admit the existence of the Illuminati; they admit the existence of the Order; they admit the existence of the Brotherhood; they admit that all these secret organizations, including Freemasonry, are all the same organization, all working towards the same goal. An incredible admission printed in their own publication, a hardbound book found up on a dusty shelf, way back in the rear corner of an old used bookstore. Such is the work of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence, CAJI. (William Cooper offers CAJI memberships) \"[Quoting again from the book:] The American Constellation of thirteen stars set in the form of a double triangle was foretold by Merlin of King Arthur's Court, and the Philosophy of the Holy Grail and of Egypt's glory and Solomon's Temple, has been the Day star of every great American Statesman from Washington to Abraham Lincoln. [William Cooper]: Now, if you've been listing to this program, you know the Day star is a reference to Lucifer, the light bringer, the angel of light, the morning star...also known as the sun of the morning. \"After the ceremonies in the grove, there was given in the dining room of 'Beverly Hall' at midnight a 'Feast of the Gods' at which neither meat nor spices formed part of the menu, but only fruits, nuts and other products of sun kissed foods.\" [William Cooper]: And that should tell you something about Sunkist oranges. (laughs) \"The conclusion of the rites was held at sunrise in the grove with a musical communion service, in which Nectar of roses, distilled from the thirty thousand roses blooming each June upon the lawns at 'Beverly Hall,' was served as emblematic of the wine of the Soul, and for this service the rose bushes were planted several years ago. [William Cooper: This is also from the book, folks.] \"I wish that all the readers of this book might have been present at the preparation, at the building, and at the Dedication of this Ancient Magic Circle. Or, I wish that I might be able to give a detailed description of these sublime ceremonies in this book. However, I cannot do this here, though I hope that in some future work I will be able to do so. Sufficient be it to say, that when the stone, made out of cement by one of the Brothers, was nearly finished, the Dedication took place, and the emblems placed in the stone itself before it was completed, were: \"The American Beauty Rose in full bloom. This as a representation, or symbol of the Soul that has reached full Illumination. \"The Mystic ring. This was a solid gold ring, belonging to one of the members present, upon which had been engraved the Cross and Pentagram. All members of the Magi will know what this symbol stands for. The ring itself, as is known to the Magi, is a protecting agent against all evil or malignant influences when worn during any ceremonial or developing work. \"[And] The True Magic Mirror. This is an emblem of the Soul, which when fully developed will act as a mirror to the universe wherein may be wisdom and truth. \"Lastly, a complete copy of the private text book, 'Ritualistic Occultism,' which contains the ceremonies as made use of by the Magi, and four of these ceremonials were made use of by four of the Magi, in the dedication of the Magic Circle. \"When all of this had taken place, the stone was completed and then later in the day the characters were engraved upon the stone by the Brother who had completed the stone. \"Of the midnight 'Feast to the Gods' and of the morning services which took place in the grove it is not lawful for me to speak at this 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"time, but it is my sincere prayer that all who are enrolled in the Sacred Schools may some day be present with us and witness these sublime ceremonies, especially as they are conferred in the Spring of the year. [William Cooper: In the spring of the year.] \"Arrangements were made by the delegates present, through voluntary contributions, to either buy another large grove, or if that is found impracticable, to build a much larger Hall in the 'Grove of Osiris' so that advanced ceremonies may be held the coming Spring at the 69th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order.\" [William Cooper]: Now, I'm going to reveal something to you that I've never told you before on this program. I've been working up to it, and now is the time to tell you before I read from the next section of this book. For then you will understand what has been happening in the last fifty years, and what is happening now. [William Cooper]: It was Harry Truman, a 33rd degree Freemason, who signed the United Nations treaty, who pushed through and signed the United Nations Participation Act. It was also Harry Truman, a 33rd degree Freemason, operating in concert with Wild Bill Donovan, the head of the OSS, a member of the Sovereign and Military Order of the Knights of Malta and of the Order of the Knights Templar, who created the National Security Act ‐‐ pushed it through congress. Harry Truman signed it. It created the umbrella of national security, a curtain of secrecy. [William Cooper]: It created the Central Intelligence Agency. And behind this curtain of secrecy, the secret societies have been working to destroy the sovereignty of all nations and bring about a one ‐ world, totalitarian, Socialist government. And, folks, all of the bugaboo enemies that you've been afraid of all your life were never enemies at all. For these were deceptions, manipulations. The only enemy, folks, that the people of the world have ever had is right here. Right here in this country, down at the corner in your town in the temple that has no windows. [William Cooper]: And, now, reading again from the book: The Report from the 68th Convocation Of the Rose Cross Order, Introduction to the Great Seal : \"It is rather a strange and an unknown thing for one to write an introduction to a single chapter appearing in a book, but the conditions are so unusual as to warrant it. \"More than a year ago, Grace K. Morey, the author of the article, 'The Great Seal of the United States and Its Mystic Significance,' prepared a sketch for a short primer of the Illuminati teachings, and in this sketch, as will be shown by the drawings, it was brought out that man is not only a threefold being, but that he is actually a four ‐ fold being as well. In short, that when he has succeeded in reaching Soul Illumination, he is the completed Pyramid or true Triangle. \"If the student will give serious study to the article on the Seal of the United States, he will find that on the reverse side of the seal which is as yet uncut, there is to be found the Pyramid, but with the capstone as yet not placed, and thus he will see that the Philosophy of the Illuminati is the absolute and undeniable Philosophy upon which these United States are founded as is clearly indicated by our four ‐ fold philosophy, by the drawings representing our Philosophy, and by the drawings of the reverse side of the United States seal. \"And thus it would appear that the Unseen Hierarchies which shaped the foundation of the great Republic which must some day rule the world, are the same Hierarchies which gave us the Soul Science Philosophy as taught by the Illuminati.\" [William Cooper]: And, now, you know why what has happened in this country has happened, and you know why what is happening today is happening. And you now know why, on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, are the words Novus Ordo Seclorum , which, literally translated, means \"The New Order of the Ages\" (also known as \"The New World Order), but I won't let you rest with that shock. [William Cooper]: Listen to this, dear listeners. Hold on to your chairs, because the incredible admission that is coming to you right out of the pages of this book is going to knock you flat. Reading again from the book: \"And thus it would appear that the Unseen Hierarchies which shaped the foundation of the great Republic which must some day rule the world, are the same Hierarchies which gave us the Soul Science Philosophy as taught by the Illuminati. \"And now let us look into the future, not far, but just beyond the line. We find that scholars condemn the design of the reverse side of the United States Seal, that it has never been cut but has remained hidden as though it were something to be ashamed of. \"However, though this appears the truth, it is not the truth. The reason why it has never been cut is because the time is not yet as the cap ‐ stone has not yet been set. 158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"\"And what is this cap ‐ stone? My reader, prepare for a shock. \"When Atlantis ruled the word, that which is now America was connected with Egypt by what is now Mexico, and in Mexico, in the territory of Yucatan, there is a Pyramid in which the Fire Philosophers worshiped God as Divine Fire and Life in like manner as did the Initiates of Egypt, for the two were then one . \"America is not complete, and will not be complete, cannot be complete, until Mexico is again part of America as she was in the long ago, and when Mexico is once again a part of the United States, then will the cap ‐ stone have been set on the Pyramid and the reverse side of the United States seal will be cut. \"Thus you will see that the Soul Science Primer with its drawings, is but the beginning of the article concerning the Seal of the United States, while the article on 'Body, Mind, Spirit and Soul' is the finale thereof. \"May it not be long until the Holy Pyramid shall be completed and may it be completed without the shedding of blood. \"Lovingly given, R. Swinburne Clymer. 'Beverly Hall,' Quakertown, Pennsylvania, July 6th, 1916.\" [William Cooper]: And, now, you know the final truth, ladies and gentlemen. Now you know the purpose of the free trade agreements. Now you know the purpose of GATT and NAFTA. Now you know where we're headed. Now you know the middle class in this country is doomed. Now you know that the New World Order is being brought about by the intelligence community and the secret societies, whose headquarters are in the United States of America, just thirteen blocks from the White House. Now you know, in the incredible admissions, in their own writing, in this book, published by the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross. Now you know that the Illuminati is real; that Freemasonry is a part of the Illuminati; that the Rose and Cross is a part of the Illuminati; that they are also called the Order, the Brotherhood; that they also consist of the Knights Templars; they also consist of the Knights of Malta and all of the other secret societies whose organizational structure is in the shape of the pyramid, with a few at the top who really know what the Great Work and the Great Plan is. And a whole bunch of slathering idiots thirsting after the secrets on the bottom, who will never, ever, know anything. [William Cooper]: Are the cockroaches scattering? If this broadcast doesn't do it nothing will. If this doesn't wake you up, nothing will. If you don't understand now, the eighteen hours of the series that I've aired on the Mystery Schools, you will never understand it, now or in the future. If you don't know where we are headed now, then you never will. [William Cooper]: If you are not concerned now, then you have already placed the chains upon your ankles and you have already watched freedom fly. If this broadcast does not do it, nothing will. This is the last voice of freedom. This is the only revelatory media source in the world today. The Hour of the Time is the only outlet for truth left upon this earth. [William Cooper]: Ladies and gentlemen, what you have heard tonight is the final parting of the curtain. It is the opening of the last door that was to be opened. It is the final understanding of where we have been, where we are at and where we are going. It is the light. It is the Illumination in the darkest corners. You are looking at the forbidden fruit. You have heard tonight what you were never to hear, what has been forbidden for thousands of years. You now know what the Great Work is. You know who is bringing it about. [William Cooper]: You, too, can find this book if you search hard enough. And the incredible admissions that are contained within it will give you the ammunition and the armor to march out here on the battlefield with me, and many others, who are trying to stop what is coming. [William Cooper]: Remember what Mr Swinburne said at the end of his article and I'll read that too you again: \"May it not be long until the Holy Pyramid shall be completed and may it be completed without the shedding of blood. Lovingly given, R. Swinburne Clymer. 'Beverly Hall,' Quakertown, Pennsylvania, July 6th, 1916.\" And I am telling you now, their goal is to destroy all other religions save theirs, destroy all existing nation states save theirs, and shackle the mob, and that is you.

I'm your host, William Cooper. (opening music: old commercial for Mr. Clean ) (William Cooper advertises for Swiss America Trading) (continuing commercial) ...Now, I'm going to put a little humor in here. I just talked to Craig Smith at Swiss America trading, and he told me they're issuing three new bonds: the Bush bond with 0% interest, the Quayle bond with, of course, no maturity, and the Clinton bond with no principle. Now, that's funny, and we can appreciate a little joke, but at the same time, there's a lot of truth in what I just told you. There is no confidence in this administration. No world leader has emerged and in Bill Clinton. The United States of America may be the only superpower left on this earth to those who want to believe that, but as we're disarming, as we have taken our B ‐ 52 bombers off alert and are now scrapping them, as we are dismantling our Minutemen missiles, as we are paring down our military forces, no such...no such equivalent is taking place in Russia or any of the satellites that used to make up the Soviet Union. So folks, you may buy all of this baloney about the United States being the last great superpower, but I'm telling you right now, we are not. And if we continue on the road that we are on, not only are we going have a financial collapse, but we are going to find ourselves a third ‐ rate, third ‐ world country very quickly. All you have to do is look around. Stop buying the propaganda, use your own brain, your own eyes and ears and take a hard look at what's happening. And you don't have to be very smart at all to understand that we're going in the wrong direction. Now, what this means for you personally is everything that you worked for, you're going to lose. You're going to lose unless you take action now. Those who already taken action are already realizing an appreciation of their investments. Now, you'll have to understand that it's not a real appreciation, because as the price of gold and silver and coins have gone up, the value of the dollar has gone down and will continue to go down. What you're doing when you make these investments is you're protecting your assets and believe me, in what is coming that is the best that you can hope for at this time on your level. Call Swiss America trading right now: 1 ‐ 800 ‐ 289 ‐ 2646. That's 1 ‐ 800 ‐ 289 ‐ 2646. Talk to the experts there and let them show you how to protect yourself.

So many people tell me that they are just one person and there is nothing that they can do. That everything is lost, and all they can do is wait and see what happens. This program tonight is designed specifically to let you know that that is not true. There is a virtual army of people, individuals, acting independently on their own. CAJI members across this nation and around the world, who are affecting great change, and who are providing a flow of information that we, through this program and through our newsletter and organization, feed to the world. These men and women are unknown, and prefer to stay that way. They are my heroes. (music ends) 160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to have as my special guest today William Morgan, who is one of the members of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence and has been for some time. Now, that's all that we can tell you about his identity. You will hear from him his own story, what he's been doing, how he's been doing it, what kind of information he has collected for our organization for the citizens of this country and of the world. And we're going to talk about...well, I guess you just have to call it \"undercover operations\". This men has been undercover for the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence, and I remember several episodes of the show before, sometime during the series that we call the Mystery Schools, which we've done, I believe, nineteen hours of broadcasting covering that subject. I told you that we had infiltrated the Lodge, the Mystery Schools, Mystery Babylon. In fact, we have not only infiltrated it once, but many times in this country and in lodges around the world. So, the information that we're giving you on the Mystery Schools is not conjecture. It does not come from a bunch of people sitting around making up information. It comes from the books printed by the Ministry Schools themselves. It comes from our members who are actually in the lodge, and we check, double ‐ check everything that they bring to us. Please welcome to the Hour of the Time, William Morgan. [William Morgan (WM)]: Thank you, Bill. You can call me Will, and I really appreciate that gracious and honorable introduction. [William Cooper (WC)]: Well, we're certainly appreciative of everything that you've done. Tell us, Will, how long have you been associated with the Mystery Schools? [WM]: For over two years now. I became a Mason in June of 1991. [WC]: And what happened? How did you ever even know about Freemasonry? [WM]: Um, at first before I was, uh, exposed to your information, I was under the impression, as most people are, that they were a philanthropic organization, dealing mostly with charity, or possibly even some way associated with unions. And, uh, as most CAJI members have come to know, that is entirely not the case. [WC]: Did you have friends who were Freemasons? [WM]: Yes, I worked with somebody who was a Freemason, and I've come to find out that that is usually the most common way that a person is exposed to the craft. 'The Craft,' as they call it. [WC]: So, they call it \"The Craft\" amongst themselves. This is not something that the public is not normally aware [sic]. What does \"The Craft\" mean? What does that term mean? [WM]: Well, they consider themselves Craftsmen because they are building something and, uh, there have been many organizations throughout history with the incredible similarities to the present, modern cult of Freemasonry that have called themselves Builders , [inaudible ‐ common scenes?]. They have associated with themselves always with the erection of the structure, or the building of something that people just do not understand. We have come to understand that what they are erecting is the New World Order, and they've been working on it for thousands and thousands of years. [WC]: That's, uh, correct. Now, did your friend, or friends, try to proselytize you or talked you into joining the Lodge? [WM]: No, not at all. I must admit, I did go to them, and I was not entirely aware of the nature of their organization, or of what was in store for me when I became a member, or brother as they call it. [WC]: Now, if you had not joined CAJI, would you still be sort of in the dark about the true meaning of Freemasonry, or do the members really learn the truth about the organization during their period of time? [WM]: Had I joined CAJI, I would be as empty ‐ headed and as trusting as sheeple, as most of the Freemasons in America and across the world are today. They are not taught what The Craft is about. They do not question authority at all. They, as a rule, and from my personal experience and observation, they obey the rules without question and to the letter. [WC]: Now, a lot of people out there are going to wonder, and I know that Freemasons are going to bring this up, that if you didn't learn what you now believe that you know about the Mystery Schools in the lodge, how do you know that what you've learned while you've became a CAJI member...how do you know that that is true? [WM]: Well, because I can verify for myself. I can get up and check the facts, and look and look again to verify what is going on about the Mystery Schools. But for what the Masons claim to be, they have absolutely no proof or evidence, or even works of their own hand, to prove that they are actually involved in charity work. 161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"[WC]: Now, when you began to study, you were studying actually from two sources. You were studying the Mystery Religion in the lodge, actually, and you were studying what you were learning from the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence in trying to rectify the two, or bring the two together and make it fit. When did you finally decide that what you were learning in the lodge was really a deception? [WM]: The absolute clincher for me, what absolutely decided for me [to become?] a shadow of a doubt, and yes, I had my suspicions since I had very first become a member...You don't take blood oaths kneeling before an altar swearing yourself to secrecy for all time without being...without the group you're becoming a member of being suspect [sic]. [WC]: But, you did take these blood oaths? [WM]: Yes sir, I took all of them and there were many. [WC]: And so by the time you reach the degree level that you are at now, you've taken approximately how many oaths? [WM]: I don't even recollect. I know that there were over two dozen oaths before you could even become a Master Mason in a blue lodge of Freemasonry, which is a bit like primary school for Freemasons. The blue lodge is where they are brought in as new members from off the street, and most men who are involved in Masonry, for their lifetimes consider the blue lodge to be the heart and soul of Masonry because that is where it all begins, and that is where it all grows from. [WC]: But isn't it true that many Masons never advance beyond the third degree and remain in the blue lodge forever? [WM]: That is absolutely true, whether or not as they...they do not choose to go forth, or whether of not they're...whether they're totally unaware there is anywhere to go, is up to personally the Mason that's involved, but many of them stay right where they're at, and seem to be content with what they have [sic]. [WC]: So these Master Masons, who claim that they know everything about Freemasonry, and that they've been a Master Mason for twenty years...do they really know anything? [WM]: They know absolutely nothing. They have been completely deceived from the very first day they entered the lodge. They have been lied to regularly about the nature of The Craft, the work of The Craft, and the charity of The Craft. My own lodge, that I'm a member of, considers its charity work for the entire last year to be a donation of $100, which is a little more than the dues yearly for three members. They gave $100 to a needy family and through these very, very shallow, superficial acts, they consider themselves to be the greatest charity...charity and brotherhood organizations that is ever to walk on the face of the earth. [WC]: A recent thorough investigation of the Shriners, who have literally made their reputation upon the fact that they contribute tremendous amounts of money to charity, but the investigation disclosed that of all the money they take in, less than 3% actually goes to any charity. Were you aware of that? [WM]: (laughs) No, actually I was not. I'm not a member of the Shrine, but I have been exposed to some of their numbers. I was hoping that it would at least a little bit higher than that, because (laughs) that says bad things about the Masons who are members of the Shrine. And as most people know, the Shrine is probably one of the largest \"charity organizations\" that there is... [WC]: And one of the richest. But most of the money seems to go back into the lodge, or to the members, or to their retirement funds, or to the payment of the lodge officers. And this is something people don't realize, that the lodge officers are paid and they have a retirement fund set aside for them. Is that true? [WM]: Yes, that is true. Now, this doesn't apply directly to all officers in the lodge. I, myself, am an officer of the lodge that I was indoctrinated into...duly elected member. They operate in that kind of manner with elected officials that serve one ‐ year terms. But there is an exception to this rule, and that is the Secretary and the Treasurer. And the Secretary keeps the books and the Treasurer keeps the money, and (laughs) that points, that points a very big finger as to where the true power in every lodge lies. Because, these, these two gentlemen who held these gentlemen who held these offices, usually hold them for years and years and years. [WC]: And they're not elected, and they're not accountable, is that correct? [WM]: They are totally unaccountable. They...the Treasurer will give one budget report at a certain time during the year, and I listen to this report not two months ago, and if an account in the business world attempted to give such a superfluous report to his boss, he would be fired on the spot. [WC]: (laughs) Now, just so our listening audience realizes that you're not just some yahoo who walked in off the street and went 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"through the first degree, and are now on a radio program trying to tell them you know something about Freemasonry. What is the level of your status, or your degree or how high have you have progressed through the initiatory levels? [WM]: It's not exactly something that any thinking individual would like to brag about, but I have shot like a rocket up the ranks of Freemasonry. Much like in America today, the Mason like to keep their members busy, busy, busy. They don't want to give them time to think about what they're doing, and they don't want to give them time to think about where they're going. They do this by ritual. All of Freemasonry is tied up in ritual, and you must memorize this ritual, and it is very, very extensive. Each office has its own, whole...whole slew of ritual to remember. But I worked hard, I've got a good memory, I rose through the ranks and am now a 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Southern Jurisdiction, United States of America. [WC]: And this is the same branch of Freemasonry that Albert Pike belonged to that created the Ku Klux Klan, the B'nai B'rith and the branch off the B'nai B'rith, called the ADL or Anti ‐ Defamation League. Is that correct? [WM]: Absolutely true. Albert Pike is considered to be a demigod among Freemasons, and actually a source of light all on his own. He took the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which did exist for some time before him. He took it after the civil war and turned it into what is today. He incorporated much of the pagan symbology into the degrees that are still used in practice today. He...his name is revered. I've seen a bigger than life ‐ sized bust of complete bronze of Albert Pike that was created for $25,000. Some of that money was mine, by the way. They treat him next to Godhood in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. [WC]: Were you aware that Albert Pike was in constant communication and in concert with Giuseppe Mazzini in creating ‐‐ not only creating, but Albert Pike at one time was the Sovereign Grand Commander of all Freemasonry in the world, and operated in concert with Giuseppe Mazzini in control of what we now know is...the world body known as the Illuminati? [WM]: The name Mazzini is familiar to me, and I have come across a connection to the Illuminati in my research, but no, I was not personally aware, and this comes as no surprise. Because, with the exception of my own personal research, most of my information comes from the archives of the lodges I have participated and visited, or from Freemasons themselves. And all information is questionable at best. I never once, with the exception of one word, have I heard any reference to the Illuminati, yet my own research points exactly in their direction for the true source of the Mason's power and the reason for their concealment. But no, I did not know about Mazzini [WC]: Do the members of the lodge consider themselves to be illumined? [WM]: All of them do, without even knowing the definition of the term, the true definition of the term, they consider themselves illuminated. They go around...they have that secret little smile and they generally talk ‐‐ no, not generally, they always talk down about most of the other people in the world. I've even heard grown men refer to other fellow Americans, brothers, as \"profane,\" simply because they have advanced through the ritual of Freemasonry. [WC]: I remember a friend of mine who was a young man, who was not a member of the Lodge but his father was. And he had a friend who belonged to another family who was not a member of the lodge, but owned a small business in town. And his small business was being destroyed by the members of the lodge, simply because he was not a Freemason. And the business was going to members, or lodge brothers. And he asked his father why his friend's family was literally being destroyed by his father and others who profess to be members of a fraternal organization, existing for the community, and his father told him ‐‐ and I'll never forget this because it literally crushed my friend ‐‐ his father told him this: “If you are not one of us, you are nothing”. Is this generally true? Is this the way Freemasons generally think about people who do not belong to their organization? [WM]: I have personally seen Masonry interfere with family ties before. And yes, this is just how they look at the world. They consider the world to be profane, unilluminated, and this just goes hand in hand with the general attitude that is conveyed by all Masons; that they are on the road to their own form of godhood, and this manifests itself in severe racism. For all the people out there that may not be too familiar with Masons or Masonry and this especially goes for members of minority groups who have often and usually continue to be excluded from Freemasonry, and especially for women, I'm here to tell you that you are not welcome in the lodge. You never will be and you have never have been welcome in the lodge. This especially goes for blacks, in spite of the Prince Hall Masonry, which is the biggest joke and the biggest scam and the biggest insult to any single race I've ever seen. And especially for women; they just...they do not want you and they consider you totally ineligible to unable to understand what they do. [WC]: You told me something the other night that I found just incredible. You said that you could go to any Prince Hall lodge in any black community and be...the doors would be open to you and you would be welcome, but if they tried to...if one of those members or brothers of the lodge of the Prince Hall lodge came to your lodge and tried to come in and participate in these ceremonies, or whatever you call them...what would happen? 163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"[WM]: (laughs) It wouldn't happen. It just simply wouldn't happen. I, as a Caucasian Freemasonry, can visit any Prince Hall lodge in the country and as far as I know in the world. I can also visit any lodge, period, across the world. I have been told through my initiation that I am welcome in any lodge, but this just does not apply to blacks, no matter that ‐‐ even if the ritual they go through, and I do not know this for certain but I know it's similar, but even if the ritual were exact, even if the same form of “illumination” that they underwent was exact, they could not ever, and I sit in a lodge with Caucasian Freemasons. I have never seen a black Freemason sit in a lodge among Caucasians, and I don't think I will. Equal opportunity and affirmative action laws are just completely ignored, and considered frivolous and a joke by all Freemasons. [WC]: So, the New World Order that they are bringing into being is going to be racist? [WM]: Entirely. It has an Aryan background, and that is where it comes from. [WC]: And that's been borne out by our research. Why then would the black community form their own lodges and support the bringing about a New World Order that is going to relegate them back into slavery? And I might add along with the rest of us who don't belong to this religion, and it is a religion. Why would they participate in something like that? [WM]: Well, as you've told me yourself, and most people will understand this, the world loves a mystery. And you can control the masses by dangling a secret like a carrot in front of their nose, and promising them the answer to that secret if they just merely do what they say and work for you. This, together with man's own fallible, entirely fallible human nature, and the selfishness of man, and the ego of man, they want to be something. They want to be better than, than the people around them that they see. And since they have been told straight out that they will never advance to the ranks of Caucasian Freemasons, they have have settled for just being better than their own people, and excluding other Blacks from joining their own lodge. [WC]: So, one of the holds that Freemasonry has over people is that ordinary people whether they be black, white, oriental, Hispanic doesn't matter, they want to be part of the elect. Is that true? [WM]: Exactly, that they want to join the elite. They like to look down on their fellow man. [WC]: Okay, now, if nobody coerced you, if nobody proselytized you, how did you get into the lodge? [WM]: I went to the door and I knocked on it. (audio clip: woman knocks on a door and is attacked by a monster) It's time for our break, folks. Don't go away, I'll be right back after this very short pause. (William Cooper advertises for Swiss America Trading) (break music: The Great Pretender , performed by The Platters) [WC]: We're back in the studio, folks, with William Morgan, a CAJI member who has infiltrated the lodge. Now, this man is no dummy. You have to understand, within two years he is risen from Entered Apprentice to 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite of the Southern Jurisdiction. Now, that's quite a distinction in the lodge isn't it? [WM]: Well, yeah it can be considered as such. It does get a measure of respect from those who never advance past the 3rd degree of Master Mason. [WC]: And what is the next step? [WM]: After the 32nd degree there is publicly known only one more degree of Freemasonry and that is the 33rd degree. [WC]: And you said \"publicly known\", does that mean that there's more? [WM]: I suspect that there is... that there really is more. 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"[WC]: Do you know that for sure? [WM]: No, I do not. I do not know it for sure. I've heard...there's a man by the name of Reverend Jim Shaw who was a 33rd ‐‐ well, he actually still is by a Masonic law ‐‐ who still is a 33rd degree Freemason, and when he became a 33rd degree he knew another Mason who was going through the same ritual who said he was going to be even further because he had professed a support for the Luciferian doctrine that they preach. [WC]: So what you have just said, this is coming from your mouth, a 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite, you have just said...I didn't prompt you, I didn't ask you the question, in fact you just surprised me because I was going to lead up to this. But you just said the Luciferian doctrine. Can you explain that? [WM]: I can explain that, absolutely. Masons believe in light. It is a priority part of their entire ritual. Now, light to a Mason symbolizes knowledge and also intellect. And if you've paid attention to the Mystery School broadcasts, you know who the patron god of intellect is: it is Lucifer, and in fact his very name means the Ferryer(?) or the Bearer of Light. \"Luc\" is Latin for light, and \" ‐ fer\" is Latin for Ferryer. This is the true god of Freemasonry and this is also, to my great shame, the god that I knelt at the altar before and swore my blood oath to. [WC]: But when you did this, were you aware you were swearing your blood oath to Lucifer and not to the God of the Christian Bible? [WM]: Absolutely not. Everything about Masonry says and publicly said that their god is the same god as any god, the god of Hindus, the god of Arab [sic], the God of Christians, but it's just not so. It's a lie and it's a scam, and all you do is study paganism, nature worship and the Mystery Religion of Babylon to see who that real god is. [WC]: So, you have done this study on your own, and you've checked out the publications and the doctrines and the symbology within your own lodge and you have arrived at the conclusion that the god of Freemasonry is who? [WM]: The god of Freemasonry is Lucifer, who is actually Satan, cast from Heaven for one specific reason and that is because he, like many other Masons, sought to attain godhood in his own time. [WC]: And isn't that really the goal of Freemasonry; by their works, they will become god? [WM]: Exactly, it is a matter of works; salvation has nothing to do with it. There is no repentance of sin and in their minds, mankind was never separated from God, but is able to be an equal to or superior to God. [WC]: Now mind you folks, I sincerely believe in the Constitution of the United States of America. This is not a religious program, irregardless [sic] of what you may think you are hearing, and I'm not making judgment on any of this whatsoever. I believe that anyone has the right under our Constitution to worship at any altar that they wish to worship at. I do not agree with this Luciferian doctrine. I do not worship at that altar. The only thing that bothers me in the performance of their religion is that they are attempting to control and manipulate the rest of us into a one ‐ world totalitarian socialist government with a one ‐ world religion that we will all have to bow down to, with Lucifer or Satan as the head of the religion ‐‐ actually, incarnated in the human body, they intend to install Lucifer upon the throne of the world. Have you found any credence for this? [WM]: I found great credence for this, and the best place to go to confirm this is just pick up the book, Morals ...pick up the book Morals and Dogma by Albert Pike. He, himself, will state: number one, that Masonry is a religion, and number two, that Lucifer is involved. That is all I needed to confirm my suspicions, and it should be all that is needed to confirm the suspicions of all the other Masons that are out there wandering in darkness, thinking that they are living in illumination. [WC]: So most Freemasons, do they really believe that Freemasonry is a Christian organization? [WM]: No, no, they really don't. They may themselves be Christians and most in America are, but it is a strict rule and law of the lodge, written their own constitutions, that no discussions or debates concerning religion or politics ever be brought into the lodge. They do not want your Christianity broadcast, they do not want it mentioned at all. In fact I had a personal friend of mine, who was a police officer in the lodge of which I'm a member, and when he was asked in whom he put his trust, he said, “The Lord Jesus Christ,” and from that day forward, even though he's a law enforcement officer and vitally important to the New World Order, he has been ostracized, and he has been left out of many of the activities that got me to where I am in the Craft today. And I do not think that he will even be allowed to progress any farther because of that. [WC]: In fact, I think you told me the other night, that that was the first time that you ever heard the name of Jesus Christ mentioned in 165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"that lodge ever and is that true? [WM]: (laughs) Absolutely, or any other Lodge or any Masonic publication, or any writing, or even any words out of another Freemason's mouth. It is just not part of their vocabulary. In fact, I have very firm beliefs that the name itself brings actual pain to their ears. [WC]: Now, we know that the lodge will welcome anyone who attends any church, synagogue, temple, cathedral, that belongs to any religion whatsoever, but we know that Freemasonry is a religion because we've studied it and we have people like you who are a Freemason at a very high degree and have confirmed it, and their own writing confirms it. Albert Pike has stated in writing in his book, Morals and Dogma , and in others of his writings, I might add. And Manly P. Hall has confirmed that. So, if Freemasonry is a religion, yet they accept members, people who go to other churches in the community and many different religions that have doctrines that don't agree at all, how can they rectify – I mean, how can you explain this? How can this be? [WM]: It just is, and any Mason that holds that his religious convictions dear and becomes a member of the lodge, is in direct conflict with his own beliefs and his own, his own faith. The two cannot go together, have never been able to go together, and I don't think they ever will be. And I like to ask all of my...well, I'd like to tell all my brothers in the Lodges out there: how can you possibly believe that Freemasonry is not a religion? You meet in a Masonic temple, you knelt at a Masonic altar with the Holy Bible, or in outer countries a different holy book, Qur'an or many other texts, you knelt there and swore your blood oaths in the name of a deity, and quiet respect is demanded in any and all lodges all over the world, just like in any temple. You have been living a lie and if you don't wake up pretty soon, the New World Order will turn around at eat your lunch for you. [WC]: Isn't it a fact that they believe they are going to be an integral part of this New World Order, however, most of them will not be? [WM]: This is the great joke. This is the punchline to the whole affair. They believe and see themselves as the priests and the priesthood of the New World Order. They think that when all things start falling apart, that they are going to be the ones that rise up Phoenix ‐ like out of the ashes, bring the world together and deliver them into the hands of Lucifer. Like I said, they consider themselves builders, and what they're building is the New World Order, and it's being erected like a prison around us even as we speak. And the capstone, and you ought to look at the great seal of the United States to get a feel for this, the capstone of the New World Order of the building that they are creating is actually Lucifer himself. [WC]: And isn't that the symbol of Lucifer, the all ‐ seeing Eye above the pyramid, the symbol of light? It actually began as the symbol of the sun, which was the symbol of the light, which was the symbol for Lucifer, and over the years it evolved into an eye. Christians are told that is the eye of God, but nobody ever bothers to ask, \"Which god, or who?\" [WM]: (laughs) Right. [WC]: What's the name of this god? And, you know, if a Muslim were to ask in the Middle East, they would say it's the eye of God, and they would think it's the eye of Allah. And in the Far East, somebody might think it was the eye of Buddha, but this is never explained. In effect, it really began representing the sun, it became the eye; the sun has always been the representation of wisdom or the intellect, or knowledge, which is all the Luciferian doctrine. It is the symbol for the light, Lucifer the fallen angel, the Luciferian philosophy. [WM]: These are, these are facts. This is just the way it is. I'm holding in my hand at this very moment, an official Masonic medallion that is handed out to many Masons as a gift, especially at Entered Apprentice. At the very top, and taking up the main position in this medallion, is the all ‐ seeing eye, and this eye is, just as Bill Cooper has said, a combination of the eye of “god” and I stress that quote ‐ unquote more than the other. And also it is the sun, it is a symbol of sun worship. The eye that I'm seeing, the lashes on the eye, on this medallion that I am holding, are actually the rays of the sun coming down to illuminate the fellow Masons. It is, it is more than just a religion, and as Albert Pike has professed, it is the oldest known religion. It is a pagan religion of sun worship, it is nature worship. And it is incredible dangerous to free loving people everywhere. [WC]: You wanted to read something from a book that you have there. This is a book that I highly recommend ‐‐ that everybody in the listening audience must read this book. You must read this book. You can find it at most religious bookstores, Christian or otherwise, they usually stock it. It's called The Godmakers . The Godmakers , by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt, and let me see who the publishers are...Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, Oregon 97402. That's Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, Oregon 97402. Again, the name of the book is The Godmakers , by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt. This book will truly open your eyes. You wanted to read something from that book? [WM]: Yes, sir, I was reading this last night and it just stopped me in my tracks. I'm on page 60 of The Godmakers and the chapter, entitled The Mormon Dilemma , and this book is about the Mormons and, once you begin reading, you'll see through the Mystery Schools just how close Freemasonry and Mormonism actually is. The subtitle of this part is called, The Pagan Connection , and again, I'll read it quickly: 166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\"As C.S. Lewis and a number of other experts have concluded, there are only two religions in the world: Christianity and Hinduism (paganism). One teaches that we are separated from the one true God by sin, and that God became a man to die for our sins. The other declared that men are not separated from God, but that each person has within himself the power to overcome evil and thus to become God [or at least a god with a small 'g']. Hinduism (paganism) embraces and absorbs everything except biblical Christianity, which is its own genuine rival. Though it uses Christian language to disguise its paganism [just as many Masonic lodges do], Mormonism is less Christian than it is Hindu. The basic dilemma faced by every Mormon is the direct result of its Hindu roots. In the Bhagwad Gita , Krishna declares that he comes forth to save the righteous and to condemn the sinner. This is exactly the opposite for the biblical Christ, who saves sinners. The great complaint of paganism and all occult secret societies [of which I am presently a member] is that where as one must be worthy to join them, Christianity deliberately embraces the unworthy.\" And to prove my worthiness to join the lodge, I had to ask them to become a member. At the time that I joined, it was against the constitution's bylaw ‐‐ the constitution of Freemasonry, I must stress ‐‐ for any Mason to come to me, a profane, and ask me to join.\" [WC]: And, in effect, actually, isn't the Mormon church just another branch of the old Mystery Religion of Babylon? [WM]: It can be nothing else. They have three degrees. They have ritual they adhere to. They're sworn to secrecy with blood oaths inside of a temple. They have a structural hierarchy that is in the structure of pyramid, and all those that are initiated into this temple ritual seek nothing else but to climb the pyramid. The reward, the carrot that is dangled in front of their nose to keep them working hard, hard, hard, is that they will experience and attain godhood for themselves. [WC]: And many of the rituals that are practiced in the temple are the exact same rituals that are practiced in the Masonic temple. [WM]: I cannot personally confirm this, but the research that I am involved in at this time supports this – and also the research of experts who are far better and far more along in their work than I am – totally supports this claim. And you should verify it for yourself. [WC]: Absolutely. You know, the warning we always give them on this show...don't believe anything you hear on this show, or any other show, or from the President, Dan Rather, anyone until you check it out for yourself. One thing that I also wanted to mention is that we have nothing against anyone. We have nothing against people who want to worship in the Mormon religion, or the Catholic religion, or go to a temple and worship Buddha We believe in the Constitution, but we also believe that everyone should know what they're getting into. We also believe that, if these people are involved in subverting the freedoms of others and bringing about a one ‐ world totalitarian socialist government, which we have confirmed that they are, then it is our business and our duty to stop them. [WM]: Bingo, Bill, and hit upon something that is a catch ‐ 22 for all Masons. Part of the blood oath says that you can never ‐‐ and you must swear this on penalty of very painful and bloody death ‐‐ that you will never, ever release any of the secrets of Masonry to a member of the profane, to somebody out there in the big world. But, when you become a Mason, and as I did, I always ask questions wherever I go. I ask some hard questions and I got nothing. There were no answers forthcoming. They looked me straight in the eye and I said, \"I can't tell you.\" [WC]: How do you rectify what you're doing on this show, with the oaths that you took saying that you can't do this? [WM]: Well, we've discussed this, and I have had some personal dilemmas that I had to face, but I genuinely believe that when they do not tell me the whole truth about what I'm getting into...in fact, when they deliberately mislead me and deceive me about what I'm getting into, that that must totally invalidate the contract, or the oath, which I have swore. It just cannot be any other way. They have lied, and I have been honest and I have been forthcoming to them, but they have not returned it as such. [WC]: And I found myself in the same position, folks, because when I was in the military, and specifically with the Office of Naval Intelligence, I had to sign security oaths, saying that I would never talk about anything that I was involved with. But later, when I began to realize that I was going to have to, I also understood that the only things that I would talk about were those things that the intelligence community, the military, those in government, were doing, were doing to destroy the sovereignty of the United States of America, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and to bring about, really, a traitorous new government, the New World Order, and that I was not going to be involved in any traitorous activity, and my first and only loyalty was to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights of the United States, and not to some phony manipulation called a \"security oath,\" which many people are trapped under, thinking that they cannot talk about many of the things they participated in that are actually destroying this nation, destroying the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These people are traitors, and I could not be a traitor, nor will I ever be. What do you feel about this New World Order that's coming? [WM]: It makes me want to vomit. You're absolutely right; they are traitors. They have turned their backs on their people, they have turned their backs on their country, they have turned their backs on their family. They're living a lie, and it's not going to turn out exactly how they think. They are like the cops. The police officers in America that are deliberately destroying the Constitution and treating their 167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"own people as an enemy. They can't be a cop forever, neither can you be a practicing Mason forever. One day that protection that you cherish so much must end. And when it does, it will turn around and it will gobble you up, like it's gobbling up so many people right now. [WC]: Well, not only that, but many Americans are waking up. The patriots in this country, the people who really understand and love the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are going to have an awful lot to say about what's happening, and of course there are other people like me, like you. We have the largest civilian intelligence gathering organization in the world operating full ‐ time, breaking this secrecy down, bringing together the truth. And now, we're running out of time for another episode of Hour of the Time, folks [sic]. I want you to remember: we love you and we care about you or we wouldn't be doing this. Good night, God bless you, and remember this: (closing music: Only You (And You Alone) , performed by The Platters) 168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Part 21: William Morgan Interview, Part II audio link: http://www.remnantradio.org/Archives/articles/William% 20Cooper/Mystery%20Babylon/audio/mystery%20babylon%2020 ‐ 22b.mp3 You're listening to the Hour of the Time. I'm your host, William Cooper. (William Cooper begins commercial for Swiss America Trading) (continues commercial): You know, you people out there don't realize what kind of controversy this program stirs up. You don't hear the attempts to discredit this program and try to get our sponsors to abandon us. People have called Craig Smith at Swiss America Trading. They have tried to get them to abandon this program because of the information that we have disclosed, and some of the names of those people would amaze you. Would absolutely amaze you and maybe, at some later date, we might decide to disclose that. But right now, we're not going to. The radio stations that broadcast this program also received phone calls and letters, usually anonymous, with the end of trying to make them drop us. Swiss America Trading has stuck by us this whole time. So has WWCR and WRNO, because all of these people understand the meaning of the information that this program puts out to the world. And they know how important it is that you receive this information. Now, I've got to tell ya, we received requests to be sponsored by many other people, products, companies, and we turned them all down. One reason is because some of them wanted to sponsor us with the intention of restricting what we say. Others, we didn't believe in those products or those people or those companies, and could not (laughs) in good conscience recommend them to anyone. But Swiss America Trading is different... (finishes commercial) Tonight's episode: part two of the interview with William Morgan, CAJI member. We have infiltrated the lodge, folks. Hear it yourself from the lips of a 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite of the Southern Jurisdiction. (opening music: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For , live performance by U2, taken from the film Rattle and Hum ?) Well, as you probably already know, folks, we only use the very best music on this program, the Hour of the Time. That was U2 and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For . You know, many of you write and ask why I let the music go on through the whole selection instead of fading it out and then bringing in the program. And I do that, folks, out of sincere admiration and respect for the talent and the performance of the writer of the music, the lyrics, and, of course, those who perform. I love music, if you haven't guessed that already. Tonight is part two of our interview with William Morgan, and many of you are wondering if that's his real name. No, it is not. We protect CAJI members. We never tell anyone how many CAJI members we have, we're they're at, what their names are, anything. None of that information is given out, not even to other CAJI members. Now, we use the code name, or the pseudonym, of William Morgan, simply because the name William Morgan is significant in the past of the (laughs) secret society called Freemasonry. William Morgan was murdered by Freemasons after having revealed, printed in a book, some of the secrets of the lodge, and this was done back in the 1800s. Of course, the fraternity of Freemasons denies they murdered William Morgan. However, their version differs significantly from the official version and from the proof and the evidence that we have spent many, many hundreds of man ‐ hours digging up, and one of these nights we're going to do a program just entirely on the murder of William Morgan. [William Cooper (WC)]: Will, welcome back to the Hour of the Time. [William Morgan (WM)]: Thank you, Bill. It's a pleasure to be here, and I'm really proud and happy to be here, and doing what I'm doing. 169"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"[WC]: You know, I don't think a lot of people realize that you're risking your life by doing this. The oaths that you have taken, albeit, because they were fraudulent. You thought that you were making an oath to the God of the Bible and, in fact, you were making an oath to Lucifer, which nullifies those oaths. But they still, the Brotherhood, the Order, the Illuminati, the Freemasons, could still carry out the threat of those oaths, which is murder, is that not correct? [WM]: Absolutely correct. No matter what I may personally feel about it, or what common law or the actual law may view about those oaths [I've] taken, the Masons that are involved consider them to be absolutely applicable to any transgression. And they have been enforced, and the bloody punishments that are part of the oaths have happened to Masons before, and they will happen again, I'm sure. [WC]: Now, you are what degree? Let's get that out to the people in case we have some new listeners tonight. What degree are you? [WM]: I am a 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States. [WC]: And what is the official title of that degree? [WM]: The official title is \"The Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret,\" and that is not only the title of the degree, it's also the title of the ritual that the degree is conferred to. And just to show you how important that is, after going through the ritual and getting the degree conferred upon me, I could not remember anything sublime or, even remember what the secret was that they told me. (laughs) [WC]: Why is it that you couldn't remember the secrets of the degree? [WM]: Well, um, that's a bit of a long story and I won't go entirely into it, but it started off the day I was conferred began at six o'clock in the morning, and they just rush through it. There's no memory work to do as in the Blue Lodge, where a person has to memorize the ritual and then give it back. You just sit there and received, in an audience ‐ like capacity. And when it came to swearing the oath, you merely held up your hand and said, \"I do.\" You also did take that oath on kneeling on one knee, as you did in the blue lodge. [WC]: Now, we talked yesterday after we aired the...after we recorded the last program that aired, I believe Friday on WRNO. And this will air Monday on WRNO. It will air at a different date on WWCR. So, if you're listening on WWCR, don't let these dates confuse you. But we talked and I asked you specifically if there was a part of Freemasonry where you raised your arm to the square, and what was your reply? [WM]: Yes, there is a part where you raise your arm to the square. The first time I remember doing that action was in the second degree when it was conferred upon me. You raise your right hand as if you're swearing in...actually, it's exactly the same position as if you were swearing in a court of law. Your left hand is placed flatly upon the Holy Bible, or whatever holy text that depend [sic] on the lodge you're in, and your right hand is held at a right angle with the arm extended. And they...an actual square, like an engineer square, is held around the elbow of the arm. That's...you're swearing in a square within a square, so to speak, as the ritual says. [WC]: Now, if a Freemason were speaking in front of a group of what Masons call \"the profane,\" would it be fair to state that, if the speaker stated something about when he raised his arm to the square, that this could be a recognition signal to notify other Freemasons in the audience that was indeed a Freemason? [WM]: Knowing what I know, I could hardly see it as anything else. There's no square involved in any other oath swearing ceremony that I ever heard of, ever...not in a court of law, only a square is involved in Masonry. It's one of the, uh, it's one of the primary tools that are symbolically referred to in all the ritual of the Blue Lodge. [WC]: Now, many of you heard this, this statement made by someone that you all listened to, and I want you to make that connection for yourselves. If you can't make that connection for yourself, then there's no need telling you any more about it anyway. Let's get into some of the ceremonies. How does this start? It begins in the Blue Lodge with the first degree of Entered Apprentice, and it goes up, and you've actually traversed thirty ‐ two degrees of initiation. Are there side roads off of this? [WM]: Um, yeah...well, it's a bit difficult. The Blue Lodge is where everything begins, and the Blue Lodge where a Mason is initiated at is called the mother lodge from that time after in specific reference to him personally. Now, once you get passed the third degree and become a Master Mason in your Blue Lodge, you are able to hold an officer, or hold a chair as an officer inside the lodge, and you can spend up to ten years going through the chairs and become an officer. But after that, you can either go to the Scottish Rite or the Yorkish Rite. There's a fork in the road of Freemasonry, and the Scottish Rite is by far the most popular and, undoubtedly, the most powerful. [WC]: Now, the York Rite is...has seven degrees, is that true? [WM]: True, the highest of which being the Knight Templar degree. For all those people out there who think that the Knights Templar is 170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"no way associated with Masons, you're dead wrong and you haven't done your homework. [WC]: In fact, the Knights Templar, when they first began as an organization on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, were not an order commissioned or ordained or approved or even recognized by any church, much less the Catholic church, but were, in fact, an order of the Mysteries. They began with seven degrees, and the seventh degree was the highest degree. And later, as they added degrees, when the Knights Templar were persecuted and, in fact, many of them were put to death, others were driven into hiding in other countries, and, in some other countries, they just changed their names and continued the order. And they eventually reached a number of degrees which was thirty ‐ three. And I took that right out of a very old textbook on the secret societies, which we'll talk about in a later program, and we'll get into that. But what is the significance that you've been told of the system of degrees? Why do you have to go through this? [WM]: It's considered a road, it's considered a road to \"illumination.\" I really believe that it's more a system of control and self ‐ government. Lodges are pretty unique in America, in that they are self ‐ sustaining and self ‐ governing, even with their own bit of enforcement. All lodges have been granted a charter from a Grand Lodge, and every Grand Lodge in this country has been granted a charter from the United States government to operate on its own and enforce its own laws and constitutions. If a police officer or any law enforcement officer walks into a lodge while in session, not only does he not have arrest power, but that lodge immediately closes. [WC]: Now, this is something the American people don't know about. Now, if these are lodges, they're in states, they have nothing to do with the federal government, how can they receive a charter from the federal government saying that they're under their own laws, and how it could be the law enforcement officer would not have the authority to arrest, or any of his other authorized duties, in a Freemasonic lodge? [WM]: It beats the hell out of me, Bill. It's really a bit of a contradiction in terms. You have a government that is actually gone out and given government ‐ type status to a completely and secret [sic], and I think subversive, organization right under its own nose. A similar thing can be seen in the Mormon church and in other secret societies that are not nearly so famous as Freemasonry itself. The government has, by granting this charter, I believe undermined its own stability as a functioning organization. [WC]: Well, tell us about this charter. Tell us again what you said before. I don't want anyone to miss this because it's very important. It shows how a secret government can be formed, it tell us that these members of these secret societies literally have diplomatic immunity and can get away with whatever they want to get away with. Not only that, but they have their members sitting in the most powerful posts, both within society on local levels and local cities, local counties and state governments, in the higher echelons of the military, and they permeate all the positions of control within the bureaucracy of the federal government. So tell us what this charter is for? [WM]: OK, it is a...it's a document, put out by the federal government, and it can be any government in the world. To my knowledge, every government in the world that [granted?] has lodges in it, has granted a sovereign charter to the Grand Lodges under its jurisdiction. I really haven't done enough research to speak at length on the nature of the charter, or what it exactly implies universally for Freemasonry, but I do know for a fact that a law enforcement officer ‐‐ and we have many law enforcement officers in our lodge, from state troopers to policemen to military policemen ‐‐ that they're not cops when they walked into a lodge. They leave their power, their badges and their guns outside, and they do so willingly. That's a pretty good example, but I think the best example comes from the Knights of Malta, and here's another one for you guys out there that haven't done your homework. I'm reading from the glossary of a book, entitled Freemasonry: A Celebration of the Craft , which is put out by the Craft itself, and it defines Knights of Malta as a Christian, Masonic degree, based upon the medieval Knights Hospitallers, emphasizing the Christian values, the Christian virtues. (laughs) You can leave the Christian out of it if you'd like, but what's interesting about the Knights of Malta is they actually do have diplomatic immunity as an organization. They can bring goods in and out of this country without going through customs, and they cannot be arrested or they cannot be detained or charged with any crime by any law enforcement officer in the country. They are...they're above sovereign. As far as I know, they're above most government officials in the land. [WC]: That's a fact, and they actually carry diplomatic passports. I know several people personally who are members of the Knights, the Sovereign Order of the Military Knights of Malta, and they carry diplomatic passports and are...they began as citizens of the United States of America. Now, what happens when a police officer, and most police officers, we have discovered, or at least the ones who make law enforcement a career, and most, if not all, judges sitting upon benches in this country are Freemasons. What happens when you're speeding down a highway and you're stopped by a law enforcement officer...what happens when he sees the Masonic emblem on your windshield? [WM]: Usually what you have is a direct turnaround in attitude. I, myself, am a young man. I get hassled by cops a little bit. It seems like they always cop an attitude when they pulled me over. But when they see the Masonic square and compass on my car, and most importantly, when I flip out my dues paying card, a card that all dues paying Masons carry, the police officer...well, let me just put it this way, I've never once got a speeding ticket or a traffic ticket or have even been harassed in any way when they have known that I am a Mason. It just has not happened. That is my personal experience. 171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"[WC]: So the justice system in this country doesn't really work, and Freemasons are, in effect, exempt from the laws that the rest of us are supposed to follow, is that true? [WM]: (laughs) Yeah, that could be probably construed as accurate, Bill, although I disagree...it does work, it just doesn't work the way most people think it works (laughs). It works for them and with them and around them, and it works on the rest of you. [WC]: That's right. Now, what happens when a Freemason goes into court against someone who is not a Freemason, and the judge is a Freemason? [WM]: OK, well, you have a very subtle interaction that goes on. All Masons are taught secret signs and secret words and secret phrases by...and this is some of the most...this is what they don't want revealed more than anything else. You can stand in a particular position, you can hold your arms in a particular position, you can speak certain words, the \"widow's son\", \"traveling man\", key phrases to let this judge know that you are a Mason. And you can almost guarantee the Mason are else he wouldn't be able to lock down a lasting career in the judiciary. [WC]: That's correct, and that would explain why some people just don't seem to ever get prosecuted for anything, and others, who may commit the same crime or a much lesser offense seem to be inordinately punished, given such a heavy burden of punishment, while others who have done the same thing receive either nothing or a pat of the wrist. [WM]: Well, brothers look out for each other. It's just the way the system works. It's a buddy system, it's a \"you scratch my back, I scratch yours\"...as a matter of fact, in the oath that a Mason swears, he swears that he will uphold and defend a Mason, a fellow Mason in any problem that he may encounter; treason and murder alone excepted, but they [left at their] election, which means even if a fellow Mason is a traitor to his country ‐‐ we know that could never happen ‐‐ (laughs) he's a traitor to his country, his brother Mason has his own choice whether he wants to turn him in or not. He is not obligated to do so and, obeying the laws of Masonry above the laws of the land, he's probably not going to even consider it. [WC]: So, in other words, one way of infiltrated and controlling our society and our government, both on a local, state and national level, and the military, is for one of the Freemasons to get into a position where he can then appoint or hire Freemasons below him. When people come to apply for that job, who gets the job? [WM]: That's self ‐ explanatory, the Mason'll get the job every time. Another part of the oath is that you will look out for the interest of your brother Masons in whatever capacity they may be in. In fact, it could probably be construed that not giving the job to a Mason would bring serious repercussions if discovered inside the lodge. It may even be a violation of the oath. [WC]: There you go, folks. All of you who have been telling me that I'm full of crap, and that I don't know what I'm talking about and that they haven't infiltrated and appointed their members below them and literally taken over all [levels] of society, both local, state, and federal and the military...you just heard it from the lips of a 32nd degree Freemason. That is exactly how they do it and that is exactly what has been done. You have to understand that, since this country was conceived and brought into reality, Freemasons have controlled it. And their goal, always, from the beginning, was to bring about a one ‐ world totalitarian Socialist government. Our forefathers knew full well the foibles of human nature, and this country was described, in their own words, as the Great Experiment. And the experiment, folks, was to find out if we truly could be responsible, could rule ourselves, would not give in to the foibles of human nature and give our country and our individual freedoms and rights away. But they knew when they did it that that's exactly what would happen, because they were, they were probably the best at understanding human nature of anyone that I've ever read, and I have read all of their writings, letters and works, and the Federalist papers and everything else that they've done. And they knew full well that this people would give away what they built. And they knew that if we could be responsible, if we would not be apathetic, if we would not cave in to the desires of Socialism, to the weaknesses of human nature, that this would have been the New World Order. We have failed, not them. They gave us every chance, folks, so don't get mad at our forefathers. Is this...would you concur with what I just said? [WM]: I couldn't argue with you and I wouldn't want to start an argument with you, Bill. I have heard high level Masons refer to the United States, in their writings and in person, as a \"Mason nation,\" [that] is erected by them, if you look at the signers of the Declaration of Independence, if you look at the forefathers, you'll see who was involved at the very beginning of this thing. And I'm not saying that all our forefathers were bad or evil, they certainly are not. They created the greatest nation ever known to man. But some of them were Illuminati, and there's just no denying that. The course that they set us upon was, in the end, self ‐ defeating for us. [WC]: OK, folks, don't go away. We've got to take our break. I'm be right back with William Morgan after this very short pause.

Before you accuse me, you better look at yourself. (laughs) Oh boy, does that apply to this program, you Freemasons out there. All members of all the secret societies that is subverting the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights...I call them cockroaches, I don't know what the rest of you call them, but that's what they are. They claim to be looking for the light, but every time you turn the light on them, they scurry under the sink...run for cover. You know, it occurs to me that I need to tell you folks out there something. This young man on this program is a member of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence, and there are literally hundreds of brave men and women all over this country and the world who are gathering information, bringing the truth out into the open. We are all working for freedom. It's the largest and most successful civilian intelligence gathering organization in the world. And our goal is freedom, to preserve freedom in this country, the United States, preserve the Constitution and the Bill of Rights because it's the last bastion, the last wall between us and freedom, and try to institute freedom in all of the rest of the world. That's our only purpose, our only purpose. We are in support of freedom for all peoples, all peoples everywhere. This young man on this show has risked his life to tell you what he's telling you tonight, and if his identity were ever to be discovered, he could be murdered by the secret societies that he is revealing. He is one of my heroes. Most of the people in CAJI who are helping us to do this, most of them are working in intense, secret and dangerous situations. We have people who have infiltrated Satanic organizations and are feeding us the information on their rituals and who they are and what they're all about. And the instant that they were to be discovered, they would be murdered. You don't seem to understand that this organization that I built, the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence, is vital, is vital to the freedom of the United States of America and to the world. The governmental intelligence agencies are in the control of the secret societies and are not working on our behalf and never have been, folks. I hope you understand that. Let's go back to Will. You've got something in front of you, and I believe it's a list of Freemasons throughout history that people would recognize their names, and if they don't readily recognize their names, they could go to any reference book and find these names and their biographies in any library. Would you like to tell our listening audience who some of these people are? [WM]: Yeah, there's some names you'll really recognize, here. But before I do, let me thank you, Bill Cooper, for reminding me that my brothers might murder me just for telling the truth. Um, here's one: Colonel Buzz Aldrin, Simon Bonner(?), Omar Bradley, Edmund Burke, Richard Byrd, Kit Carson, Walter Chrysler, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody, Ty Cobb, Winston Churchill, the list just goes on and on...Gordon Cooper, Edwin Drake, Jack Dempsey, Cecil B. DeMille... [WC]: You know, you mention Winston Churchill, and one of the things that the listening audience does not know is that not only was Winston Churchill was a Freemason, but so was Harry Truman, and so was Mr. [Joseph] Stalin. So, when they had their meeting at Yalta, here was [sic] three 33rd degree Freemasons deciding the fate of the world. And for all of you who couldn't figure out why they made the decisions that they made at Yalta that so screwed up the world, now you know. Please continue. [WM]: (laughs) Thanks, Bill. Yeah, they should have just held that Yalta meeting in a lodge and been open about it. OK, here's some more for us: Duke Ellington, Henry Ford, Benjamin Franklin, Clark Gable, John Glenn, [inaudible], Richard Gatling, inventor of the Gatling gun, Samuel Gompers, Prince Hall, Manly Palmer [Hall]...oh yeah, Joseph Guillotine, who invented the Guillotine, who we'll be seeing that more later [sic]. Oh boy, (laughs) there's just simply not time...Edgar Hoover, Sam Houston... [WC]: For those of you who did not understand his reference to \"we'll be seeing more of the Guillotine later,\" when the New World Order actually succeeds in taking control of the world, executions will be public, and the secret societies believe in blood atonement. In other words, you can only atone for your wrongdoing by your works, or by the shedding of your blood, blood atonement. So, in these public executions, there will have to be the maximum amount of blood, public executions will be held as a object lesson to the rest of the population not to oppose the New World Order, for it is the most terrible, terrifying experience to see someone literally beheaded. It is intended to cow everyone else, and is, in fact, will be, in fact, a ritualistic sacrifice to the god of the secret societies who, we all now know, is Lucifer, also known as Satan. [WM]: Yeah, you know, Bill, it just dawned on me just what a fun guy you really are! (laughs) Here's a short list of presidents of the United States who have been Masons: George Washington, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, James Garfield, William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, William Taft, Warren Harding, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, and I also know for a fact that George Bush is a Mason and that Ronald Reagan was made a Mason on sight. (laughs) Like I said, the list goes on and on, and these are not even a partial, partial, fraction of a percent of the famous Masons that have existed throughout history. [WC]: Well, John Wayne was Mason, wasn't he? [WM]: \"The Duke.\" \"The Duke\" was a Freemason, absolutely true. 173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"[WC]: And, you know, we're not in any way belittling the accomplishments or the contributions to society of any of these people. We just wanted to let you know that his covers all areas of society, all levels of society, all occupations, and that many famous people whom you all recognize have been...are members of these secret societies. Now, many of them are taken in as window ‐ dressing; in other words, they don't really know what they are a part of. They're told that it's a fraternal organization existing for the good of the community, and of course, in any organization, if you can get famous celebrities to belong, it's a feather in your cap because the public, for some reason, thinks that if a celebrity belongs to something, than there could be nothing wrong with it. What sheeple! What, what total crap! But that's the way people believe. [WM]: That's absolutely true. Most of the celebrity names that I mentioned in this list are there just simply as window ‐ dressing, to give a good appearance to the Craft. But some of them absolutely are not, and I'm reading from this book, published by a Mason publishing company, and it states that Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon church, was absolutely and undeniably a Freemason. [WC]: Did you find Giuseppe Mazzini in there? [WM]: Yeah, I sure did, I did my homework. Giuseppe Mazzini, 1805 ‐ 1872, Italian patriot. [WC]: He was also one of the best friends and corespondents of Albert Pike, who was the head of world Freemasonry for a while, and the head of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in this country. He established, with others, the Ku Klux Klan, the branch of Freemasonry known as B'nai B'rith, which the ADL operates out of, and the ADL, folks, for those of you who don't know it, are under intense investigation now for spying upon agencies and departments of the United States government and police departments, and actually stealing records and passing them on to the secret societies and to the state of Israel. So, you really better wake up out there, and don't give me this stuff that it's the Jews, that it's the blacks, it's this, it's that. It's not. It's not. Ordinary people like you and me, I don't care what their skin color is, I don't care what their religion is, are just like you and me and all they want to do is live in peace. There are elements in organizations and people belonging to all the different ethnic groups, all of the different religions, all of the different organizations, corporations, governments, anything that you want to name, belong to these secret societies. The Jews have been used as scapegoats throughout history. The Freemasonic organization, and the secret societies in general, are racist. They believe that the races, the white Caucasian races in Europe and Germany, England, are the superior race, or the real Israelites. They are the ones who have orchestrated and brought about the state of Israel. They are the ones who maintain the force of Zionism, active in the world. The Mormon church is a great part of this. I mean, if you just give down and dirty on this, you'll find that what I'm telling you is absolutely true. And one of their main weapons that they use against us to divide us against each other, so that while we're running around stabbing each other in the back, they are putting the chains on all of us. And when you are people going to realize that and understand it? All during the Cold War, there were no Russian families sitting around their table plotting on how to do away with Americans, and they're weren't any Americans doing that, either. All of us were concerned with our children, with putting food on the table, with educating our children, with trying to build some kind of good life. That's all that ordinary people care about. It doesn't matter what race they belong to, what religion they belong to... [WM]: Bravo, Bill. If there's a lesson that the listeners can go home with, that is...it's that, stop this racist divisionism, come together and see the enemy for who it is. I should...like I said on your program, you cannot be...you cannot enjoy the protection of the secret societies forever. With a little bit of homework, you can find out how financed Hitler in World War II. And, anybody that had knows [sic] history knows that as soon as Hitler got to where he was at in power [sic], who did he initiate a [power grab] against? It wasn't just Jews. He got rid of all the Freemasons who were the window ‐ dressing in German and in Austria, who put him in where he was at and protected his interests...he zapped them. He nuked them. They were gone, they joined the Jews and gypsies in the concentration camps and they were never heard from again. And to this day, many German Freemasons wear a small flower on their lapel in remembrance of that tragic event. You cannot enjoy that protection forever. You are doomed to fail if you depend on these people for your life. [WC]: That's correct. Now remember, the primary method they use is this: conflict creates change. They create the conflict that they know will bring about the solution that they want. They get it to appear as if the people are screaming for the solution, and then they give it to them. Something that the people would never accept it in the first place. But remember, conflict creates change. They believe in the Hegelian principle of conflict resolution. You have a thesis, an antithesis, and these...the clash of these two creates the solution to the problem, which they've been aiming for all along. Now, you also have to understand that controlled conflict creates desired results, or change. So, the method bringing about controlled conflict is to have your people leading both sides of the conflict. So, when you talk about Republican or Democrat, forget it! At the highest level, they're both the same. When you talk about Populist versus Communist, or whatever it is, forget it! At the highest level, they all belong to the same organization. When you look around in the Patriot movement, remember, most of the leaders in the Patriot movement are on the same side, and belong to the same organizations, as the leaders of the secret societies that are trying to destroy this country. The conflict between the two, which are trying to create now, will ensure the destruction of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and then they will step forward with the answer: a thousand ‐ years of peace under the United Nations. But you're going to have to make concessions to get it. You're going to have to give up your freedoms, your individual rights, but they will protect you. If you buy that, folks, you are indeed a fool. Does this confirm what you've discovered in your quest for 174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the truth? [WM]: It certainly does, it is history repeating itself with empty promises of a Nirvana and Utopia on earth that has never come true, and they always have to be the one to pay for it. Always. These people do not believe in a fair fight. They do not join a race that they have not fixed. They don't take those kinds of risks. [WC]: You've got about ten seconds. If you had the ability to say something to the American people, and to the world, what would it be? [WM]: It would be to wake up, folks. Look, you've got an enemy out there that are coming together. There's a convention of Southern Baptists that have come against the Freemasons, meeting in Houston in 15th, 16th, 17th June of this year [sic]. I suggest that you look into that. [WC]: That's right, folks, and good night. Thank you, Will, for being our special guest, for putting yourself in danger for all of the rest of our freedoms, for freedom of the world. I, for one, appreciate that. You are my hero. Good night, and may God bless you all.

(William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss America Trading) Tonight, episode number 21 in our series of Mystery Babylon, and the third hour of interview with William Morgan. (opening music: I Can See Clearly Now , performed live by Liza Minnelli) [WC]: Welcome, Will, once again to the Hour of the Time. [WM]: Thanks, Bill, it's a pleasure to be here. [WC]: Tonight, we decided that we're going to talk about some of the symbology connected with the rites of Freemasonry, the secret symbols of identification and things of that nature...wherever you want to start, go right ahead. [WM]: OK, well, all of the important symbols and passwords are incorporated into the first three degrees. The handshake, I think, is the most widely used Masonic symbol. It consists of [an] ordinary handshake, except the thumb of the person who is a Mason goes onto the third knuckle of the right hand of the person he's shaking hands with. If you ever shaken hands with somebody and they seem to have a funny grip, or possibly even ‐ I always thought it seemed kind of feminine to me because the hand just wasn't strongly wrapped around your hand when you're shaking hands with somebody. You can have a pretty good idea that they're trying to feel you out and see if you're a Mason like they are. The first two degrees ‐‐ that was the handshake of the third degree. The first two degrees are the same, except first degree [sic], the thumb goes on the first knuckle and the second degree, the thumb goes on the second knuckle. But those are very, very rarely used. [WC]: And in the Master Mason, or the third degree, the thumb is on the third knuckle. That's correct? [WM]: Yes sir, and, uh... [WC]: And how would you reply to that if you were, in fact, a Freemason? [WM]: You do the exact same. It becomes a combined grip, and your thumb is on his third knuckle and his thumb will be on your third knuckle, and, uh...(laughs) you can't miss it when somebody tries to slip you this handshake. [WC]: So, it's not really a true handshake in the sense of the word that most people have learned to shake hands. You don't have a full grip of the other person's hand, but, rather, you just have a sort of a loose grip on their fingers, and your thumb is either on the first, second or third knuckle, and you're sort of digging with that thumb to try to get a reaction to see if the other person is, indeed, a Freemason, and at what level. [WM]: That's true, that's true, and if they do not respond as such, that person will withdraw his hand quickly. But if he's not sure, he'll seems to kind of extend his grip just a little bit to give you a chance to, to return the sign...they call it a \"sign\". [WC]: Now, besides the handshake, what other signs or signals are used to identify one Freemason to another? [WM]: The most subtle one, and the one that you often have to look out for in public places, is how a man stands. The position of his feet will be a dead giveaway. Most people stand in just a leisurely position with their feet pointing outward, just a slight...just slightly. But 176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"a Freemason will stand with his feet in an exact square, at a right ‐ angle, heel ‐ to ‐ heel. This is the \"step\"...they call the \"step of a Master Mason\". The step of an Entered Apprentice, a first degree Mason, is where the feet form a sort of 'T' with the heel going to the cup of the other foot, and the second degree is an inverse of the third degree, with the...another square being formed. [WC]: So, if you see someone standing in a room with their two heels joined together and their feet forming a perfect right angle, or 90° angle, you can pretty much bet that that's such an unnatural stance, that that is a dead giveaway that that person is a Master Mason. [WM]: Unnatural and uncomfortable, I might add, too (laughs) to anybody who stood...you're forced to stand like this when you become initiated, you...and also when you return the ritual, you have to do memory work and memorize the ritual, and then give it back before you are raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. Yeah, it's a dead giveaway because nobody stands like that naturally, it's just not a comfortable position to stand. [WC]: And why would someone stand like that? Would they do that in a room full of strangers to let other Freemasons who might be in the room know that it's OK to come and have some kind of a fellowship with them because they're a Freemason? [WM]: I, myself, have had stood just like that for that very purpose, because it's just noticeable. It's a way of broadcasting who you are and talking to the rest of the world, without the rest of the world being able to interpret what, exactly, you are saying. [WC]: In other words, if you're not a Mason, you might look over and say, \"Boy, (laughs) that guy is kind of a nut! Look at the way he's standing.\" Whereas a Freemason would say, \"That's a brother of the Craft. I'm going to go and meet this fellow.\" [WM]: Absolutely, that's generally the way it works. Most people just aren't aware of all these signs and symbols incorporated into the Craft, but a Mason lives and breathes these things. Every time he goes to Lodge, he takes on this position, he does the hand signals, he gives the ...he usually gives the handshake to his fellow brothers just to keep in practice. These things are so much a part of Masonry and of Masons, that they spot them wherever they go. [WC]: OK, so, we know the handshake, we know the heel ‐ to ‐ heel and the right ‐ angle. We talked in the last broadcast about \"I raise my hand to the square,\" or \"I raise my arm to the square.\" What are some of the others? [WM]: Well, the others are the hand signals, and these are also used in every single Lodge, and these are...to Masons, these are what are most easily and most commonly used to communicate between Masons their identity. Of the first degree, you...the hand signal is you take your left hand, palm upward, and put it near your waist, and then your right hand, palm downward just above your left hand, forming a bit of a \"Q\". Then you hold your hands like such, and that's the hand signal of the first degree. Now, the penal sign, as they call it, is taking your right ‐ hand and drawing it in a slashing motion across the neck, and this refers to the penalty of the first ‐ degree, which is having your throat slit from ear to ear. [WC]: Now, if this were truly a benevolent, fraternal organization, why in the world would they have an oath and a penal sign to tell (laughs) other members that they could have their throat slit? And there are many others, depending upon what degree and what oath we're talking about. Why would they do that if they were really and truly a fraternal organization, bearing in my mind that grown men take their oaths very seriously if they understand the oaths and they're not being defrauded or lied to when they take the oath, and fully intended to carry out whatever oaths that they take? This is not a joke, they're not children, this is not play on the playground. [WM]: The question answers itself. You're absolutely right, this is not a joke. In fact, it's deadly serious. These are the heart secrets of the majority of the Craft, even though they're not illuminated brethren, they don't really know what's going on around them or what they're doing. They've sworn to keep these secrets above all else, because this...if a non ‐ Mason or a member of the profane knows these secrets, he can just walk right into a Lodge and sit down and be exposed to everything within. [WC]: Hmm, I hope you're listening, folks. Now, just for the benefit of our listeners, or someone who may have just turned in...or tuned in (turned in!)...or any of our fellow brother Mason out there who may be listening. Now, you took the oath but you're revealing the secrets. Why are you revealing the secrets if you took the oath? [WM]: Because I took the oath under a fraudulent contract, as such. I was told that it was a benevolent organization, that it dealt with charity, that it was arranged around God. All three of those things are bold ‐ faced lies and I can prove their falsehood. In fact, anybody can prove their falsehood with just a moment's bit of research. There are many more reliable sources than I for information that you can go to to find out the true nature of this Craft, and many religions of the world, including the Baptists and the Mormons, have condemned Freemasonry as being exactly what it purports not to be. It's not benevolent, it's not charity organized, and it's not centered around God. [WC]: Well, it's funny that you mention that the Mormons have condemned Freemasonry when they carry out the exact same rituals 177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"that are carried out in a Masonic Lodge in their temple ceremonies, and most Mormons are indeed, as was Joseph Smith, members of the Masonic Lodge. Our research shows that the public statements of the Mormon Church are often, and I mean often, contradictory to their beliefs in what they truly practice in their daily lives and within the temple. They are, in fact, a secret society, a secret organization that practices the same rights as the Masonic Lodge within their temple and have the same goal, and that is that the practitioners of the religion of the Mormon Church will, in fact, become god. That is, of course, what the other secret societies, and we're talking right now the Freemasons. They're really all are the same organization. They're working toward becoming god. [WM]: It is, it's a quest after godhood and all I can say about the Mormons ‐‐ and they're many, many similarities to Masons ‐‐ is that a pagan is a pagan is a pagan. It's nature worship, they believe in the laws of the universe as being what they have to answer to, and if you know these laws, you can manipulate the populace. It's elitism at its very best. [WC]: Now, let me ask you this for the benefit of our listeners also. Many people write me letters and say hey, my dad or my uncle or my cousin or my friend is a Freemason and I ask them about these things and they've told me that it's not true, that it's all a lie. Will Freemasons lie to hide the truth? [WM]: Every single time, if the truth will give away what they don't want to give away. And in fact, I've been lied to by brothers in the Craft, that are allegedly, or supposedly teaching me and instructing me in what goes on. They...if they told the truth, it would scare away their members and it would end up in universal condemnation of what they're doing. No reasonable and moral person could possibly subject themselves to such bloody oaths and to such total secrecy. [WC]: Not only that, but the oaths themselves...they're sworn to secrecy. So, if you were to ask them to tell you the secrets of the truth about the practices, the rituals, the true religion of the Masonic Lodge, they are sworn not to tell you, so therefore they would, they would have to lie. And the only reason that you are telling is because you discovered that the oaths that you have taken and the purposes for which you thought the Masonic fraternity was organized, it just is not true at all. So, therefore, everything that you've participated in, you participated under fraudulent conditions. [WM]: Yeah, that is exactly true, and as such, I don't consider myself to be bound by those oaths because I was lied to before I entered into those oaths. This is common law, this is the law of many lands, and it's also just makes ...it makes perfect common sense that both parties have to know what is going on in all terms of the contract before they can be held accountable for their deeds within that contract. [WC]: That's correct. And the oath, the oaths that you took, you thought were for a different purpose and to a different god then the god that you discovered, and the purpose that you finally discovered. So, folks out there, when you go and ask your relatives or your friends for your cousins or your business associates questions about the lodge, about freemasonry, about any secret society, no matter what name it is: the Rose and Cross, the Knights Templars, the Knights of Malta, the Order of St. John in Jerusalem, any of these people, they cannot and will not tell you the truth because it is forbidden to them and, in fact, if they do, they could find themselves suffering from the consequences of the very oaths they took not to reveal these secrets. Now, what are some of the other signs that we have not discussed? [WM]: OK, I covered the first degree. The second degree we've also partially covered. The sign of the second degree is to hold your right arm, extended outward with the elbow at a right ‐ angle and the hand facing up, palm forward. And the penal sign of that is to draw you right hand across your chest, from left to right in a claw ‐ like motion; [it] refers to the penalty of the second degree, which is to have your breast torn open and your heart and biles taken [inaudible] and given to the birds...\"the birds of the air and beasts of the field.\" That's an exact quote from the ritual, by the way. And the third degree consists of both hands, palm down, extended outward at the waist, and then to draw the hand across the waist, from left to right, which refer to have your body torn in twain , which is the penalty for revealing the secrets of the third degree is to have to your body torn in twain, and the parts carried north and south. That is, again, a direct quote from the ritual. [WC]: So, the first one is the recognition signal and the second is what you call the penal sign. [WM]: Yes, yes, that's true. [WC]: And are there other signs and signals connected with Freemasonry? [WM]: There are many others. There is a recognition signal and a penal sign for every single degree in Freemasonry, and I have been through the 32nd degree and have experienced all these recognition signals and penal signs. But the...all the signs after the third degree are not nearly as important as the first three, and the reason for this is because Masons, in general, are just not invited to know all the secrets of the Order. It is not uncommon to know a Mason, as you stated before, who never ever advances beyond the third degree. And I should state now that a Mason who is in the third degree, he can be the Master of his Lodge, the Worshipful Master, as they call it, of 178"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"his Lodge, which is a bit like an elected...it is an elected office, a bit like President, but lasts for one year. Not all Masons are in the Scottish Rite or the Shrine or the Yorkish Rite, but all Masons do know the signs of the first three degrees and the penal signs. [WC]: And, in fact, most Masons are really only guilty of joining an organization they know nothing about and for giving it protection and favor and helping it along. But they really don't know what it's all about, do they? [WM]: True, true, they don't. They're as ignorant as I was, and if they're out there listening, I'd like to say that you can follow the exact same path I have followed. Now that you know the truth about the Craft – whether you believe me or not – you should go out and verify for yourself. And once you do verify for yourself, you are no longer bound by those oaths, either. They are fraudulent and they are ridiculous, unreasonable and brutal in many ways. [WC]: Not only that, but once you do know about it, you are no longer innocent, but you are...if you don't do something about it, or leave the Lodge, or do as this young gentleman is doing, help us to relieve ourselves from the yolk of these secret societies who are planning on stripping us of our freedoms and our rights. If you don't, then you are...then you are a fellow conspirator and are just as guilty as those who have always known, and you better understand that, because I'm telling you right now, patriots in this country are getting fed up. And the purpose of this show is to prevent bloodshed. We want to wake people up and do something about this while we can, legally and lawfully. Because, folks, there will come a day when people will not take it anymore, and they will take weapons in hand, unfortunately. Uh, we can see it coming. Anybody with half a brain can look around and talk to people, and see that that day is going to come. Because nothing is getting better, it's only getting worse, and we don't want that to happen. That's why we're doing this. That's why I've dedicated my life, and that's why I've suffered so much in my life, to try and wake people up, is to prevent that kind of thing. And they are dead set on seeing their dream come true, aren't they, Will? [WM]: They have dedicated their lives, their labors and, indeed, their entire faith to this, and you have not exaggerated or overrated the problem at all. This is dangerous, people. These men mean business. The Scottish Rite themselves have taken a public stance totally in support of public education by the government. Now, all you need to do is look at how screwed up your schools are, and then turn around and look at how screwed up your kids are, and you've got a big, big , rich organization out there with incredible political power and widespread influence that is supporting this current failed system. This is just one, isolated example. If you are not part of the solution and you have even been, just [a tiny bit] exposed to the truth, then you are part of the problem. [WC]: That's correct, and we know that public education, conducted and supervised and organized and funded by the government, is one of the planks of the Communist Manifesto , written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Now, why would Americans ever support such a thing? The strength of our educational system, before it began to self ‐ destruct, was that is always handled, funded, and governed, and maintained, and approved, and anything else on a local level. In other words, the school system in my town might be different from the school system in someone else's town a hundred miles away, but it would controlled, governed, decided, textbooks would be chosen, everything, on a local level. Our schools did not begin to self ‐ destruct until the state got into the school system, and then the federal government began to poke into it and, specifically, when teachers' colleges by the Carnegie, the Ford and the Rockefeller Institutes began to change what they taught teachers to teach children. And when that happened, when it became an organized, funded, dictated to, type thing [sic], then it began to fall apart. And the less control on the local level, the less our children are educated. [WM]: You've hit the nail right on the head. As you've stated in your own book, Behold a Pale Horse , the true enemy is not Communism, but Illuminism. When the Berlin Wall fell and Eastern Europe was opened up, it wasn't all the American companies that beat a path to their door to go open up these markets to make money. There were two groups, and they were both religious in nature. One were the evangelists who went over there to try to spread the Word of their religion, and the other were Freemasons who stepped in just the very moment the Communists stepped out. Already, lodges have been consecrated in St. Petersburg, in Moscow, and in several other major cities, and they're just popping up all over. You've got people, very old men, who actually remember when the Lodges were around before Stalin wiped them out, and they're bringing them back to replace the Communist masters that they just got rid of. [WC]: And the only reason that Stalin did away with the Lodges in the Soviet Union was because Stalin was a 33rd degree Freemason. He knew how he had risen to power, he knew what the organization was and he didn't want them turning against him, so he got rid of them. [WM]: Absolutely, they're subversive. They got him – just like Hitler – they got him to where he wanted to be, and he's not going to let anybody put him out of place with the same tools that he rose to power with. [WC]: OK, well, this...(laughs)...we're making a lot of progress, here. If you were to walk into a room and see two grown men hugging, what would you look for as identifying traits that would tell you that these two men hugging were Freemasons? [WM]: There is a certain pattern ritual that goes...that has something to do with that. It deals with the interchange of the...one of the most secret passwords of Freemasonry, and you must go...you must stand foot ‐ to ‐ foot with another Mason, knee ‐ to ‐ knee, hand ‐ to ‐ 179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"back, and mouth ‐ to ‐ ear, and then whisper the secret word in a very low voice. And I'm not going to do any of those things, I'm just going to tell you: the word is Marhaba , and I don't even know what it means, but I do know where it comes from, and it comes from the ancient Hindu religion, which is the original pagan religion. And many of the other secret words in Freemasonry are of an exact same source. [WC]: And they call this the \"five points of fellowship,\" do they not? [WM]: They do, you (laughs), you've done your homework, Bill! (laughs) [WC]: Well, I, I know more about Freemasonry and the secret societies than most members of Freemasonry and the secret societies ever will. And I was, as I've told my listeners, and as I've published in my book, a member of DeMolay when I was a teenager. I went to exactly three meetings. And DeMolay, folks, is a branch of Freemasonry for children, for teenagers, actually. And I attended three meetings, and my father was transferred to Japan, and I never attended another meeting, ever. But I do believe that that's what got me – in fact, I know it is – that's what opened the door for me to enter as a member of the Office of Naval Intelligence many years later. When I filled out my forms for security clearance, there was nothing on there for the order of DeMolay, but I knew that it was a branch of Freemasonry. So, I checked Freemasonry, and by golly, all of a sudden, things began to open for me that had never opened for me before, and in which most people who are not Freemasons find impossible to enter into. And I was surprised for a while and a little mystified until I discovered the real reason. But every member of Naval Intelligence that I ever met was a Freemason, and most of them wore their rings. What are these rings? How can someone identify the ring of a Freemason? [WM]: It sticks out like a sore thumb. It looks a bit like a fraternity ring, or a football ring, or any other signet ring, and on the very top of the ring will be a square and compass, set in what looks like a large \"A\" shape, with the square at the bottom and the compass on the top, forming what looks a bit like an \"A\", but it's not. You can tell how seriously one takes their position in the Craft. The Masons who are really there for genuine reasons, philanthropic or charity work, they have their square and compass facing to them, and those that are trying to impress and enforce the buddy system that got you in Naval Intelligence and the back scratch and whole thing [sic], they wear theirs facing the outside to tell everybody else in the world who they are. [WC]: But, really, the only ones who really know, unless you were to ask them what that ring meant, are fellow Craft Masons. [WM]: Absolutely [WC]: I shouldn't say fellow Craft, that's the second degree. (laughs) Are fellow brothers of the Lodge. [WC]: OK, folks, we've got to take our break. Don't go away, we'll be right back after this very short pause. (William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss America Trading) (break music: We Are The People , performed by John Mellencamp) [WC]: Welcome back to the Hour of the Time. Will, you got something there that you want to say, I think. [WM]: Uh, yeah, I just...I'd like to give a little message to my brother Masons out there. I know that all those who are listening are thinking some pretty hard thoughts about me. You're thinking things like I'm a traitor to the Craft. Well, I'm thinking that you're a traitor to your country. And if you think I've betrayed my brothers, I feel that you have betrayed me with your deception. If you believe that I have broken my oaths – and even if those oaths are valid, something I do not believe; I think they're null and void – well, then I just have to say that so what? We all got to go, and my brothers can go quietly into slavery, living a lie and burying their heads in the sand, or you can go like a man, squarely facing the truth, and fighting for freedom. I honestly believe this and I honestly believe that the whole nature of the craft is sinister. [WC]: Wow, that's...that's quite a statement there, and I certainly admire you for saying that. I had no idea that you were going to do that, in fact. You showed me the piece of paper just as the music was beginning to fade out, and indicated to me that you wanted to say something, so...yeah, wow, that's pretty good. Um, OK, let's get on into the rest of the program. What are some of the...are there other signs and symbols that the secret societies, Freemasons in general, use to identify themselves to each other? [WM]: I have never been a member of any other secret society besides Freemasonry, and (laughs) much to my joy and to your good fortune out there, I have already told you most of the secrets that are protected by the Craft, as far as the common laymen of the Craft 180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"will know, with the exception of one, and that is concerning Hiram Abiff, who is a bit of a patron saint, I guess, of Freemasonry, somebody they pulled from the Bible and turned into a character to give meaning to their ritual. When two Masons come together, one of the easiest ways that they'll come to know each other, without having to shake hands, hug in the middle of the street, or do a little foot dance or whatever kind of nonsense that they're doing out there. They'll just come up and say, \"Well hi, Hiram, how're you doing?\", or \"Hello, Mr. Abiff.\" Or if you want to catch a Mason on the phone, you just tell them H. Abiff is calling and believe me, you'll get service right away! [WC]: Well, that's good to know. We can certainly use information like that. But we know that some of the signals...symbols, signals and signs used in the Masonic order were also used by the Knights Templars and others. So, this didn't come strictly from this one society, but literally they are all one. What are some of the vocal signals out there ‐ the speech, what words besides Hiram Abiff? What else would you say to someone to illicit whether or not they were, in fact, Freemasons? [WM]: One of them that I've also come across ‐‐ and I've seen this in writing, and it was a bit of a mystery to me until I sought some advice about it. They'll ask each other if they're a, if they're a traveling man, and what they mean by ‐‐ and this comes directly from the old Templar ritual, and it stands as a positive factual link of the continuity between ancient secret societies and modern Freemasonry, is they'll ask if they're a traveling man, and the meaning behind that is one traveling from west to east, east being the source of knowledge. [WC]: Or illumination. It's also the point where the sun rises, which goes back to the first religion which was cosmology, where all of these religions and secret societies sprang from, which was the worship of the sun, the source of illumination, the source of warmth, the source of all life, the source of everything, rises in the east [sic] every morning. And is, in fact, (laughs) for those who really understand, the morning star. Is that not correct? [WM]: Absolutely, and that's gives a great illumination (laughs), if I may say so, as to why the Worshipful Master sits in the east of the lodge. And also, why during the ritual, when a young unknowing Freemason like myself is brought in and has a degree conferred upon him, he circumnavigates ‐‐ that is, he walks around in a circle ‐‐ from all the points of the Lodge, going from the Worshipful Master in the east to the Junior Ward in the south to the Senior Ward in the west and then back to Master in the east. He is traveling as the earth travels around the sun, in a circle of worship, and it might even be a direct reference to Solomon's circle, and [as] you've told me yourself, Bill, about the traveling man, that too [is] been used by Communists, hadn't it? [WC]: Yes, in fact, if anyone who knows anything about the Internationale, or the secret society known as The International, the Internationale Communist party, the international Socialists, Socialism, if you've study them, the same passwords are used by them. All of these organizations are one. Socialism stems from the Mystery Schools. That's where it comes from. You'll find that most of the Mystery Schools preach the tenets of the Communist Manifesto , written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels whom, by the way, didn't just wrote it [sic], they were the hacks who fronted for it. They did not make it up. It came out of ancient documents and an ancient philosophy. And the password is the same: \"Are you a traveling man?\" And that's how Communists identify themselves to each other from cell to cell and country to country and kept their business secret. And I got that straight out of the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in their investigations of the Internationale, The International, the Communist party, international Socialism. They're all the same: Freemasonry, the Knights of Malta, the Rose and Cross, they're all the same organization, folks. And remember, one of their tenets is...and, in fact, Adam Weishaupt said this, \"The strength of our Order lies in its concealment,\" in its many different names, appearing under many different names and many different occupations, sometimes even appearing to oppose ourselves. But at the highest levels, they are all the same because they use the system to coerce the people to go along what they want [sic]. If they want to change something in a certain direction, they'll look at the population, the society, the problems that exist, and they will intentionally create, foment a problem in order to get the people to cry for an answer to that problem which will be the direction they want to take that society into. They will create two opposing groups. At the top of these two opposing groups will be their people so that it's a controlled conflict bringing about a controlled resolution, or a controlled, a desired end. And (laughs) you guys better wake up to this, I am telling you, you better wake up to it, you better pay attention to what you're hearing here. You better realize that this young man sitting next to me is a hero. He's risking his life to bring you this information, as are many other people operating out of the public eye. You may never, ever in your life know who they are. They're working to save your freedoms for you. And sometimes I have to sit back and [inaudible] why are we all doing this, why am I doing this, why is he doing this, why are all these people doing this when most of you out there sit back and do nothing? I have people write me letters and say, \"I don't want to be in your mailing list because somebody might get your mailing list and they might know who I am.\" I've had other people write and say, \"What is that symbol that's over your name when you sign your name on your documents? That's the sign of something evil and I don't want to be a part of your organization.\" That's fine with me, folks. To tell you what that this, for those who are interested, that's a chop. It was given to me as a gift by the head of the accounting department of the last college where I was the executive director. She was Chinese, went home to Hong Kong for Christmas, and brought that back for me. That's the way the Chinese people sign their name. It literally means, \"the director,\" the boss. And I've used it ever since because, it's...I like it, and I liked her and it was a gift. And it personalizes my signature, it's means nothing more or less than that. But you are right in asking, but you are wrong in assuming and making assumptions. You're also wrong in hiding. I want you to read my lips: New World Order. There's no place you can hide unless you can get off this planet. And forget about aliens bringing all this 181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"stuff about. The only people you have to fear are humans (laughs). And being afraid is not going to solve our problems, because fear itself is a weapon that they use against us. So...I mean, why, if the majority of people are sheeple and aren't going to help save their own butts, why should you be doing this to save them, Will? Why are you doing this? [WM]: I have a very, very easy answer for your question, and you already know the answer. It's obvious that you're doing this for the sake of your audience. Whenever you look at your daughter...whenever I look at my family, whenever I slap my dog upside the head, that's why I doing it. Because I love people in this world, and I love my people, and my people are not going to be safe until I can make this world safe. I see them in direct danger, and I'd like to say, Bill, you have a wonderful way of cutting right to the heart of many matters. You're right about the continuity of the secret societies. They are all one, and I'm here to tell you...he did not just flip through a few books and see a couple of things and say, \"OK, they're all one, they're all evil.\" It's not that easy, folks. You have to read and research, and research, and research and investigate every single corner [of this], and believe me, if it looks like a snake, and it slithers like snake, and it hisses like snake...well, hell, go ahead and step on its head, because it's a snake! [WC]: And, uh...(laughs), well, it is a snake! (laughs) And if we go right to the philosophy of all of these secret societies, is that man was held prisoner in the Garden of Eden by an unjust, vindictive God; that he was denied his own chance to become a god, and that Lucifer, through his agent, Satan, set man free with the gift of intellect, the gift of knowledge. And with that knowledge, man himself can become god. Remember, the promise that Satan made to Eve was that God was lying to them. That if they did indeed eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, they would become gods. Don't ever forget that. Those who say they are god, those who say they're going to become god, the members of the secret societies, the Mormon church, others who profess this belief, are practicing the Luciferian philosophy. They deserted the real true God, and they are following the fallen angel of light, Lucifer, Satan – who's not a god at all. They have all been deceived. If you are one of them, remember: we don't hate you, we are not trying to hurt you. If you want to continue to practice your religion, that is OK with me, and any true person who is an American and [who believes] in the Constitution. It is only when you practice your religion with the aim of taking away my freedoms and forcing me to practice your religion under a new world totalitarian Socialist government, which you intend to bring about, that it becomes not only becomes my business, but my duty to stop you. Understand that. I want to read to you from a book here, so that you'll understand where I'm getting to, and I want you to listen very closely to the closing music at the end of our program tonight. This is taken from The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries . It's in two volumes. It's...the author is [Charles William] Heckethorn. This particular set of two volumes was published, I believe, in 1965 by University Books Incorporated. The Library of Congress number is 65 ‐ 22572. So, I urge you to get this set of books because these books were written back when it was still easy to get a lot of information on the existing secret societies, much easier than it is today. I want to read to you from page 14 of volume two, under Secret Societies, Freemasonry, Rites and Customs , paragraph 391, entitled Masonic Customs : [WC]: \"Some Masonic peculiarities may conveniently be mentioned here. Freemasons frequently attend in great state at the laying the foundation stones of public buildings; they follow a master to the grave clothed with all the paraphernalia [of] their respective degrees; they date from the year of light. The Knights of the Sun, the 28th degree of the Scotch rite, acknowledge no era, but always write their date with seven naughts [or] 0,000,000. No one can be admitted into the Masonic order before the age of twenty ‐ one, but an exception is made in this country and in France in favor of the sons of Masons, who may be initiated at the age of eighteen. Such a person is called a Lewis in England [William Cooper: and that's the source of that name], and a Louveteau in France. This latter word signifies a young wolf; and the reader will remember that in the mysteries of Isis the candidate was made to wear the mask of a wolf's head. Hence a wolf and a candidate in these mysteries were [and are] synonymous. Macrobius, in his 'Saturnalia', says that the ancients perceived a relationship between the sun, the great symbol of these mysteries, and a wolf; for as the flocks of sheep and cattle disperse at the sight of the wolf, so the flocks of sheep and cattle disperse at the sight of the wolf, so the flocks of stars disappear at the approach of the sun's light. We have seen in the account of the French Workmen's Unions that the sons of Solomon still call themselves wolves. The adoption of the louveteau into the lodge takes place with a ceremony resembling that of baptism. The temple is covered with flowers, incense is burnt, and the godfather is enjoined not only to provide for the bodily wants of the new ‐ born member, but also to bring him up in the school of truth and justice. The child receives a new name, generally that of a virtue, such as Veracity, Devotion, Beneficence; the godfather pronounces for him the oath of apprentice, in which degree he is received into the Order, which, in case he should become an orphan, supports and establishes him in life.\" [WC]: Now, the key words here, folks, that I want you to remember and pay very close attention to when you hear the closing theme, or the music, that closes this program tonight, is this. I'm going to quote directly from it: \"Macrobius, in his 'Saturnalia', says that the ancients perceived a relationship between the sun, the great symbol of these mysteries, and a wolf; for as the flocks of sheep and cattle disperse at the sight of the wolf, so the flocks of sheep and cattle disperse at the sight of the wolf, so the flocks of stars disappear at the approach of the sun's light.\" Now remember, in chapter one of my book, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars , there is a quote of these people who have declared a silent, quiet war upon the American people using silent weapons that goes like this: \"A nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent.\" In other words, cattle. I prefer to call them sheeple, the sheeple of the world. And, of course, if they are the wolves, if they are the wolves, then you are the steaks on the table if you are, indeed, one of the sheeple. 182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"[WC]: Well, that takes us almost up to the mark. Will, I want to thank you once again, and since this is the last program that we're going to be doing together for quite a while, I'm going to give you the next thirty seconds to tell the people out there, the sheeple, would they should hear. [WM]: Thank you, Bill. (laughs) There's only one message for the sheeple of America, and that is (makes bleating noise), and as my family [sic], I love you. [WC]: And we're out of time once again. For all of you who have been helping in this great fight, God bless you. For the rest of you, God bless you, too, but God help you to wake up in time and I hope you listen to this closing number.

I'm your host, William Cooper... (William Cooper does commercial for Swiss American Trading) [William Cooper (WC)]: Tonight, folks, you'll notice the absence of our normal lead ‐ in music. You'll also notice that we're not going into any type of a musical selection to introduce the subject matter of this program as we usually do, simply because I want to devote the maximum amount of time to our special guest tonight, Mr. Jordan Maxwell. Now, I never met Jordan Maxwell in my life until today. I don't really know him personally. I have been introduced to him circuitously through a bevy of my own personal friends whom, after listening to my lectures, after reading my book, realize that Mr. Jordan Maxwell and I have quite a bit in common. And they prompted me, pushed me, (laughs) you might say, to meet with this gentleman, and I guess that you had the same treatment on your end, didn't you, Jordan? [Jordan Maxwell (JM)]: I certainly did, yes. [WC]: Jordan has a fascinating background. He has paralleled my research in many avenues, in many areas, and has come up with the same conclusions, the same results, the same answers to the questions that I have asked all my life. And tonight, we're going to be talking about the answers that he has come up. But first, I'm going to ask him to introduce himself to our listening audience. Jordan? [JM]: Well, thank you very much for asking me to be here. My name is Jordan Maxwell, as we've said. As of 1959, I became very interested in this subject of secret societies and subversive movements. I came about it because of my family. When I was very small, my mother's uncle worked in the Vatican's Secretary of State's office as a civilian, and on occasions when he would come back home to visit, back to this country, he would sit and talk for hours about the intrigue going on throughout the world, behind the scenes of religion and politics, and all the nefarious plans that are being fomented by governments and religion, and I became fascinated with this subject. Since then, I have...as I said, since 1959, I have really delved into subject myself, and I find the more that you know about this subject, the more you know how much you don't know, because it is an enormous subject that takes in not only the fraternal orders, the secret societies of Freemasonry, the occult societies going on back into the most ancient world, going back to pre ‐ Sumerian, and those symbols and emblems which were used in the ancient world are now even being used in our world, our modern ‐ day world and we don't even realize it. As a matter of fact, things like the oil companies, the automotive companies, the cigarette companies, use symbols and emblems. And, of course, in government, national institutions, educational institutions...our world is filled with symbols, and symbols are like the letters of the alphabet. If you put enough of them together they spell a word, and you put a lot of them together, and they tell you a story. The story I am talking about is the secret societies and occult orders that go all the way back into the ancient world, and I believe, and is my opinion, that they are still in operation today behind our major religions and major governmental agencies. The symbols and emblems you can see with your own eyes and do some research and you'll find they back into the ancient world. Now, we like to talk about...that there's a separation of church and state in America. The fact of the matter is, no such separation exists. There is a very direct connection between the religious establishment in this country and the political establishment. And, as you probably well know, has always been the case, all the way back to the pre ‐ Sumerians there. The king was always the mediator between God and man, as well as being head of the temple state. The Pharaohs, of course, of Egypt perfected this so that they were both gods and mortals who were ruling the state. The Caesars picked up on this, of course, and it's come down through the ages, and even in our country of America today, we have a direct connection between church and state. And let me draw your attention to this and make you an example, here. Churches, when you go into most churches you will find that they are, like, three tiers high and then the altar sits on the top tier. The same is true in a courtroom. You go into a courthouse and you'll see that the bench sits on three tiers high, and the three tiers high [sic] has been traced in the reference works of Freemasonry to the first three degrees of Freemasonry. [WC]: That's correct. [JM]: Yes, and...so then you have the priest who comes out, the clergy who comes out with a long robe and, incidentally, the reason why clergy always wear long robes is because it's a female garment, and it represents the feminine connection with God, and that's why 185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"clergy wear a long robe. It also has to do with...when the clergy wear the long robe, the judge...when the judge comes out, he wears the same long black robe. It's the same black robe that you wear when you graduate from university or high school. The black robe is a very important symbol. It has to with a very ancient culture called the Saturnalian cult going back into the ancient Sumeric world, the worship of Saturn. Black was a color attributed to Saturn and even today, in Islam, in Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, you have this square of Mecca within the magic circle, within the Masonic circle, and Mecca is black and it's draped in a black robe, and so this is a world fraternity of secret societies that use the same symbols. But let me get back to the government, the courtroom and the church. When you're sitting in a church or, of course, looking up to the altar, and you're looking...the priest is looking down on you [sic]. There was always a fence in the church and then there's a gate, and only the priest could go through the gate to enter the altar. The same thing is true in a court. There is the fence and there's the gate, and only the attorneys can go through, and they're called the Logas (sp?) and they go through and talk to the judge for you and, of course, the judge is sitting three tiers high so he can look down on you, and you look up to him. The same symbols which are used in religion are used in political circles, and I am saying...is my opinion that what we have in America is a religio ‐ political scheme based on a very ancient secret societies [sic] and fraternal orders, and until such time as we understand that concept that things just don't happen...I mean, what was it, Franklin Roosevelt even said, \"Anything that happens in politics, it was planned that way.\" And until such time as you understand that things are planned in politics and that there is a rhyme and a reason to things, you know, we're never going to get to the bottom of this. A classic example of what I'm talking about is, we here in this country, we hear politicians, the President, and the local leaders saying...they just can't seem to get a handle on the crime problem, the drug problem, all of the different problems that are facing us a people, and they just can't seem to get a handle on these things. However, if you don't...if you put a wrong comma on your income tax, they can get a hold on you. (laughs) Yeah, and if you go into the Amazon jungles, they'll follow you and they will find you. And it may take a while, but they'll spend millions and they will find you, and they will bring you back here and they will deal with you in public to show the rest of the people that you can mess around with other people but you don't mess with the money and the government, OK? So, the point I'm making is that they cannot seem to get a hold on crime, but they can get a hold on you. The question should be asked: How is it that a country fifty years ago, which was a lot less sophisticated, got a hold on Adolf Hitler (and he had a standing army all over the world); they can get a hold on the Soviet national economy and destroy peoples and nations all around the world. They can get a hold on anybody they want except for the drug trade, except for the crime, and I'm saying that the crime and the drug trade in this country are purposely allowed to exist and, in certain cases, even promoted. Because, according to the ancient cults of the ancient world, there was a term that has come down to us ‐‐ and many Freemasons in the audience will readily remember this ‐‐ according to the ancient cults, there was something called Ordo Ab Chao , in Latin which meant, \"order out of chaos.\" Right, so the idea was that if you can create enough chaos, that people will be sufficiently frightened and give to you the power and the political power to bring back law and order. Now, there was a television comedy program many years ago called, Get Smart . Now, when people tell you to get smart, it's implying that you're missing something here, alright? Get smart. Remember...you'll remember that on one side in the TV show, Get Smart , on one side was chaos, and the other side was control. Now I'm saying, that's exactly how you get control, by causing chaos. The idea is that, if you're going to...if you're going to pull a scam on somebody, you're going to pick somebody's pocket or something, you always have a diversion. You do something to draw the person's attention while you're picking his pocket. If you're going to break out of a prison, you'll always have the gang fight down at the far end while the guys are crawling out the hole on the other end. The idea is, you set up a diversion; you cause chaos, and out of that you can get control, because people will sufficiently frighten people will give you the power to put down these problems [sic]. Now, Adolf Hitler did this, and he worked it perfectly, and it works. A lot of people are wondering, why is it that the German people would have ever allowed Hitler to do what he did? Hitler was elected to office because of the chaos that he was doing. He was causing the chaos, the people came sufficiently frightened [sic], and so they give him the political power to put down the trouble, because they knew he was the only guy that could put down the problems, because he was the one who was causing it. So, I'm saying that the same kind of scam is being worked in this country today. We're seeing nothing but chaos and nothing but trouble, and I'm saying that it's all orchestrated. That...that you cannot, you couldn't possibly imagine people like the President of the United States making mistakes. I mean, you hear every day...what senator so ‐ and ‐ so made a terrible mistake, or the United States government made a terrible mistake in Vietnam, or they made a horrible mistake on this or that. This country don't [sic] make mistakes. If they do something, they have a reason for doing it. They don't pay these people, these doctors and professional psychologists and this whole army of brains at the Vatican, I mean at, well ‐‐ that's a Freudian slip. Probably (laughs) at the Vatican, too. But at the, at the, what is it? The Pentagon. [WC]: Pentagon. [JM]: Yeah. They don't pay these people big money to make mistakes. The President, when he does something, or this government does something, they know what they're doing. Now, it may not make any sense to you, but according to other plans, if you understand what's going on behind the scenes, it makes a lot of sense. And, ... [WC]: Well, let me interject something in here before you...Jordan, so that you'll understand. My listening audience as had twenty ‐ two hours already. Their education is far beyond anybody that you normally talk to. [JM]: Right, right. [WC]: They understand what we're talking about. They understand the involvement of the Vatican, they understand the symbology of 186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"the Mystery Schools. [JM]: Right. [WC]: Now, we may some listening audience out there [sic] who just tuned into the show, or just found it a couple of shows ago, but most of my listening audience worldwide have been listening since the 4th of May, 1992, and have an extensive education into all of this. So, if you want to cut to the meat of the matter, these people will understand. You don't have to build up to it. [JM]: (laughs) Well, I mean, I talk to audiences so often and I'm aware that, when I'm talking to an audience of people, generally, I have not been initiated into this kind of thinking, and so that's why I try and lay out a foundation for [sic]. There are a lot of occult symbols and emblems in government and religion and I want to get into one in particular. The Nazis, the Communists, the fascists and all of the ancient world powers that have ever existed have used one common symbol continually, and that's the sun. Now, if you understand that the earliest history, the pre ‐ history of the human race goes back into the most ancient times, and God knows how far back that would be, ten, twenty thousand, maybe fifty thousand years, I don't know. But if you go back to the earliest times of the human race, you can appreciate that the world was a very different place than what we live in today. OK? And so, if you understand that it was a very cold and very fearful world at night, OK? And if you'll understand also that in that cold and fearful world, when the sun went down, there was a lot of fear for your life, there were a lot of predatory animals, and so the coming of the sun the next morning was always something to look forward to, that brought warmth, that brought light, and brought security. And around that concept grew a whole religio ‐ political philosophy of the coming of the sun, \"God's Sun,\" the light of the world, and has been used by the ancient Egyptians, all the Mystery Schools and, of course, you probably will know it was referred to as Baal worship at one time. Baal was the son, \"God's Sun\", the light of the world, and...you know, the whole concept in the ancient world was that he had twelve helpers, which were the twelve signs of the Zodiac or the twelve months of the year. And, of course, he died, of course, with a crown of thorns, like the Statue of Liberty has a crown of thorns. It's the corona or the sun rays. And when we begin to see all of these connections...and, of course, in the spring of the year, the sun, which had died in winter, had passed over from the death of winter into the new life of spring, so in the old Semitic world, they celebrated the Passover. And we even say that today when someone dies ‐‐ they passed on, or they passed away, or they passed over. [WC]: Right. [JM]: And so we get the old symbolism out of Egypt of the sun dying in the winter and passing over to the new life of spring. And so, the beginning of spring we have the Passover. Uh, it's an interesting thing, too, about the Sun, is that the ancient world realized that on...the December 22nd, which was the winter solstice, they noticed something interesting on the sundials and, of course, the sundials being round, they could each degree for each date [sic], they noticed that on the 22nd, the sun did not move on the 22nd; it stayed on the sundial on the same degree. On the 23rd, it stayed on the same degree; it didn't move any further south and it didn't start back north. On the 24th, it was still on the same degree on the sundial; it didn't move. So they said ‐‐ the ancient Egyptians said ‐‐ anything that was moving and is now not moving is dead. So, therefore, they say that God's Sun died and was in his tomb, or dead, for three days. Then on December 25th, anything that was dead and in his grave and not moving for three days, and now begins to move back to the northern hemisphere, it moved its first degree, so on December 25th, they said God's Sun is born on December 25th. [WC]: Now, in the real world, this clarifies something for a lot of people that are listening out there. You're not talking anything about Christmas, you're not talking about what Christians traditionally recognize as... [JM]: No, I'm getting into symbolism... [WC]: ...the birth of Christ, you're getting into the symbolism... [JM]: ...the symbolism... [WC]: ...of the ancient religion of the sun... [JM]: Right. [WC]: ...which was later perverted in Christianity to reflect this, in order to capture the pagan worshipers into the Christian church. [JM]: Absolutely, right. Now, what I'm saying is that... [WC]: Yeah, December the 25th is not Christ's birthday. [JM]: No, not at all, no. It's the birthday of the Sun. (laughs) 187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"[WC]: That's correct. [JM]: And then...but then when you understand that this symbolism began to be a...the ancient peoples understood that the sun was revolved and it was a symbol of revolution [sic]. And today in America we have...or at least the western part of the United States, we have an oil company called Union Oil. Union Oil has as its symbol a ray or orange globe with a 76 and, of course, the commercial says, \"Get the spirit, the spirit of 76.\" The orange globe is the sun, because the Communists have always used the rising sun, you know...if you'll recall, on the Soviet national coat of arms is a rising sun that's bringing the dawn of a new day. [WC]: And the symbology of 76 plugs into what's called the... [JM]: ...union, 76, and the 13, 7 [plus] 6 is 13. [WC]: ...and the order of the trapezoid and if you figure out the formula of the ancient religion which says, \"As above, so below...\" [JM]: Yes. [WC]: The creation of this country in 1776 was guaranteed to bring into the world the new man, the illumined man... [JM]: Exactly. [WC]: Three degrees of six [inaudible], or 666. [JM]: Right. And 8 is the number in the old Kabbalistic Freemasonry, and [your] 8 was the number of new beginnings, and the new beginnings was 17, that's 7 and 1, 8, and 13 was, of course, the old mystic number of God and his 12 helpers of God, and his months make 13. And so... [WC]: It's also the number of death and rebirth... [JM]: Absolutely... [WC]: ...and resurrection or reincarnation, depending upon how you look at that, but... [JM]: So, once you get into all of the symbolism, you see that there's a rhyme and a reason to all these emblems and symbols. And something else in relation to word symbols, and God knows we're inundated by innuendos and catchphrases in this country especially. We've been hearing, since George Bush [Sr.] made it publicly known, something called the New World Order. I want to clarify something for your audience; they probably might already know this, but Europe has been referred to as the Old World, and anything coming out of Europe is Old World, alright? The Vatican has dominated Europe for about 1500, 1600 years, the Vatican has dominated Europe, Europe has dominated the world. There was a religio ‐ political economic scheme of things. That was the order of the day; the old banking houses of the Roman Empire, the old, uh, what was some of the families, Arius (sp?), Calpurnius [Piso], the Piso's family, who were a very powerful banking family who were the main brains behind...they were the Rockefellers of the Roman empire... [WC]: The Medici's? [JM]: The Medici's, absolutely. And so, when you understand that there was a banking, fraternal, religio ‐ political order that operated throughout the world, and the Vatican sat on top of that, and that was an Old World Order. Now, with the coming of America ‐‐ of course, America is referred to as the New World ‐‐ and so, what we have now is a New World Order. And that New World Order implies that there is a fraternal order operating throughout the world, operating out of America that seeks to take the place of the Old World Order and bring a new order of the world, but you must understand that you cannot have a new order, or a new building, on the same site as an old building. So, you gotta get rid of the old order first, and bring in the new order. When you get into that, and I'm sorry, I got a frog in my throat. [WC]: That's OK. [JM]: When you get into that, you get into the symbolism of Steve Spielberg and Lucas, George Lucas bring up about Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and, of course, you can't understand the last crusade if you don't understand the first crusade, right? [WC]: (laughs) Or the next crusade. [JM]: Or the next crusade, which is the real crusade, right. And then from there you get the trilogy of Star Wars , and then The Empire 188"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Strikes Back and, of course, New York is referred to as the Empire State. [WC]: That's correct. [JM]: Alright? And so, you get The Empire Strikes Back and then, of course, you might know this...that, in Freemasonry, there is a little ideologue, or a little genie ‐ like mystical character supposedly in Freemasonry that they said was their mediator between the gods and the Freemasons of the Knights Templars. And that little saint, or that little...what I say [sic]...mediator in the old Knights Templar tradition was a little, short, little monster with pointed ears and his name was Yoda, and you go into the old Masonic literature and pictured...you'll see pictures of Yoda, because he was a Jedi Knight, and if you understand that, the Jedi Knights was connected [sic] to the old order of the knightshood [sic] of the Knights Templars. So, what we're talking about here is the \"star wars\", we're talking about a spiritual war in the heavens, so to speak. [WC]: This was a cosmology, a celestial religion, so to speak. [JM]: Absolutely. [WC]: They talk about moving on to the celestial sphere... [JM]: Right. [WC]: ...when they discuss passing... [JM]: The sun was...the ancient Egyptians said that the sun walked across the sky, so, therefore, we have Luke Skywalker, you know... [WC]: ...and from this comes \"a thousand points of light\", and many other things... [JM]: A thousand points of light, or a thousand ‐ year reign of the Nazi empire, or whatever. And what we're talking about here is secret societies and their use of symbols and emblems in religion and politics and philosophy and...incidentally, when you go to...when you graduate from university – [I meant] to bring this out – when you graduate from university you wear a long black robe. The black robe is, or course, the same black robe that the priests wear. It's the same black robe that the judge wears, alright? Because the black robe symbolize...it goes back to the old Saturnalian cult, which was pre ‐ Egyptian, the worship of Saturn. And according to that ancient Semitic cult, when you got married, you wear the ring. The ring was a ring of Saturn. The women would show their submission to that god by wearing the earring. That's where we get the idea of the king being crowned; he wears a crown, or the round circle of the god of Saturn. Saturn, as I said, was assigned the color black and, therefore, the black robe is a worship of Saturn, the Saturnalian god. What was I going to say about...oh yes, and when you graduate, you graduate with a, uh, square mortar board. The square mortarboard is always the symbol of the brick masons used to mark a board. And then, of course, when you graduate, you are referred to as an alumni, which comes from the world allumini ; you have been illuminated, which basically means you now know what to kiss and when, and how to think and what to think and how to act and you have been properly educated... [WC]: Belong to the priesthood. [JM]: That's right, you belong to the priesthood, and if you go along to get along, and don't cause any problems, then you... [WC]: ...don't go along to get along, you get a little, right? [JM]: That's right, exactly. (laughs) [WC]: Nobody else gets any [of it]. [JM]: My point is, and I've said this to so many audiences, that there is...this country, the United States, as no real enemies in the world. After the second world war, especially is that true. [WC]: Every enemy, even before the second world war, were enemies that we've had, and a creation of this country. [JM]: We created them, absolutely. But there is one, there is one legitimate, believable enemy that faces America that the powers behind the throne in this country in America are truly afraid of. And this is legitimate They are totally frightened to death of us, the people, because they realize if the people ever wake up – I mean, something Joe Kennedy was quoted as saying, something to the effect of, \"Beware the American conscience, because if they ever wake up and find out what we're doing, it's going to be [hell to pay].\" And so, I believe there is a legitimate enemy that this country perceives, and that's us: people who think too much, people who read too much, 189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"and people who talk too much. [WC]: But that's always the case though, Jordan, because we know that what's coming is going to be a Socialist state. [JM]: Oh, totally. [WC]: Every time Socialism has won anywhere, the first thing that they've done is that they have literally perverted the Intelligencia, which has brought them to power, and then the first thing that they did was to kill... [JM]: ...to kill, get rid... [WC]: ...the Intelligencia, they killed them. [JM]: Absolutely. [WC]: I mean the Intelligencia aren't that intelligent. They haven't learned this yet because they're still doing it. [JM]: The more we change, the more we stay the same. [WC]: That's right, we'll come back to that in just a few minutes. Folks, I hope you're paying attention to this show, because Jordan has an awful lot to say, and you can hear that he's right in tune with what we've covered before. Don't go away. It's time to take to our break. We'll be right back, after this very short pause. (William Cooper does commercial for Swiss American Trading) [WC]: And now, let's get back to our regular program and our very special guest tonight, Mr. Jordan Maxwell. Jordan, can we talk about some of the symbols, the symbology that people are going to run into in their everyday life as they go about their business, and maybe haven't even understood what these things mean? [JM]: Yes, as a matter of fact, as we were saying before that the world around us is filled with emblems and symbols. And if you know how to read the symbols, you can tell what people are coming from. You can tell what organizations are coming from. For instance, in Washington, D.C., which is a very interesting place, you have the Washington Monument which is, of course, the Egyptian obelisk. Now, the Egyptian obelisk is pointing...is, of course, the male phallic symbol, OK? And the male, phallic on the Washington Monument [sic] is connected to something in the White House called the Oval Office. And when you understand the male phallic with the female Oval Office, you're talking about the coming of life, and that's the life of the nation. You have the Pentagon; the United States Pentagon comes from the word...from the five ‐ pointed pentagram. If you take the arms off of a five ‐ pointed star, which has been used in devil worship and Satanic worship for thousands of years, if you understand, you take the arms off of a five ‐ pointed star, the interior of the star is called a pentagon. And so, we have the United States Pentagon and, of course, the pentagon is used by the Chrysler Corporation as their symbol, the pentagon. Why? Because Chrysler was the company that was chosen to make the military hardware for the United States and they had the contract, so that's why they still use the pentagon as their symbol. And on the back of the dollar bill, of course, we don't want to forget that, because the dollar bill is cram filled [sic] with symbols. And Roosevelt, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, said that the reason why it was all these symbols [sic] were put on a one dollar bill is because you figured that, all over the world, people...any...no matter how poor you were, you would have in your hand the almighty dollar. And if have in your hand the one dollar bill, then you have in your hand all of the symbolism of the secret societies and the occult orders. Of course, one the left ‐ hand side of the back of the dollar bill, you have the pyramid. Now you got to ask yourself, why would you have an Egyptian pyramid on an American dollar bill? And then, you will see the letters, Annuit Cœptis , over the top of the pyramid. Annuit Cœptis , in Latin, means, \"Our enterprise is now a success,\" or \"God has favored our enterprise.\" The enterprise, of course, is on the banner beneath the pyramid, which is Novus Ordo Seclorum , which is the new order of the world. New order, of Seclorum [sic] is where we get the word \"secular,\" anything that's worldly. So, now we're talking about a New World Order on the bottom of the pyramid. You will find that the pyramid has thirteen layers, and there are thirteen letters in Annuit Cœptis, and then if you go to the right ‐ side, you'll see the seal of America with the eagle, and above the eagle you have thirteen stars, which stand for the thirteen colonies originally. But the thirteen colonies and the thirteen stars go back to Jesus and the twelve [disciples], because they are moving in on and using – the ancient societies – moving in on the teachings of Christianity and posing themselves under the thirteen, being Jesus and the chosen twelve. Then you've got the thirteen, let's see...on the right ‐ hand side, you've got the...on one side of the eagle, you have the thirteen leaves and the thirteen berries in the thirteen leaves, and then on the other side, you have the thirteen arrows. Everything is done is sequence of thirteen. Of course, on the...something else I wanted to bring up while I'm thinking about it, is that so much of what we have seen in movies and television are symbols. Are you aware that I have been talking to some doctors in Los Angeles who have been doing some research on this, and I find it 190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"to be absolutely fascinating, that many of the gangs, the Latino and the black gangs in the major cities across America, their graffiti that they are spraying on buildings, their graffiti are actually Masonic emblems and Masonic seals and symbols, and I have seen a whole collection that these doctors have. These are medical doctors, but they are interested in this subject, and they have been collecting hundreds of pictures of graffiti and showing the research into the ancient secret societies, and there's no way that these black and Latino gangs could know these symbols. There's definitely a connection between the gangs and some sort of a higher, orchestrated mind behind the warfare going on between gangs. I don't think those gangs are by chance. I think they have been nurtured, and orchestrated, and promoted, and even financed. I mean, if you think about it, how those gangs have money to travel all around, they can buy guns, they can roam around, they don't have to work...where are they getting their money from? [WC]: Well, not only that, but their main occupation is... [JM]: ...is chaos! [WC]: ...the narcotics business... [JM]: Of course! [WC]: ...and fomenting chaos, confusion and fear. [JM]: Right. [WC]: And they haven't got the background of understanding, learning to put together the kind of logistics network that it would take to supply this kind of an enterprise. [JM]: Absolutely. [WC]: So, someone with an awful lot of money, an awful lot of organization, an absolute ability to provide 100% protection is supplying these city gangs. It's not the mafia. [JM]: You can bet on it. [WC]: (laughs) [JM]: You can bet on it. [WC]: This is a very sophisticated, totally protected organization. [JM]: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, the San Francisco Chronicle had a two full pages [sic] in one of their newspapers I still have [sic], where they were talking about how this federal government was bringing in narcotics from Asia during the Vietnam War in the bodies of American serviceman that were being killed in Vietnam and they were bringing in bags of pure heroin and pure narcotics from Asia in the bodies of American serviceman. And what were they doing with it? They were giving it directly to the mafia, because the mafia is doing a little tricks [sic] for the government...it takes care of business for the government, and so they have to be paid. [WC]: Well, let's clarify one thing here. It's not the government... [JM]: Well, it's... [WC]: ...it is the secret societies... [JM]: ...operating behind our government. [WC]: That's correct. [JM]: Exactly, yes. [WC]: Behind the veil of national security... [JM]: Absolutely. 191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"[WC]: And I might remind you that, back in history when Albert Pike and Giuseppe Mazzini were corresponding and were setting up the core foundation of the Illuminati within Freemasonry, both in their respective countries, and at that time, of course, Albert Pike was the Grand Commander of Freemasonry and throughout the world, and Giuseppe Mazzini was his counterpart in Europe [inaudible]. It was Giuseppe Mazzini who created and fostered and gave the charter to the...what is now known as the mafia. [JM]: That's right. La Costa Nostra was Mazzini. [WC]: That's correct. [JM]: A Masonic order, no doubt about it. [WC]: And this explains the close cooperation between... [JM]: ...between government and the mafia. [WC]: That is right. [JM]: Absolutely. And when we also understand that the old magic practicing priests, that the old Celtic druid priests of ancient England in the person of Merlin the Magician [sic]. When you understand that the old priests, the magicians work their magic on people with their magic wands, and their magic wands were always made out of holly wood. And they're still working their magic today with Hollywood. If you understand how we are being manipulated, we're being programmed...Hollywood is nothing more than an instrument in the hands of the secret societies. And then, Los Angeles...anyone who knows anything about the motion picture industry knows that the real bosses are in New York and back east. Nobody makes any decisions here in Los Angeles. Those decisions are made by some very powerful people behind the scenes in New York and upstate New York. [WC]: And we're not talking about just Hollywood. We're talking about the media overall in general, including print, television, radio... [JM]: Right. [WC]: The whole works and, specifically, what we're looking at is a very sophisticated method of... [JM]: Manipulation. [WC]: ...manipulation and brainwashing. [JM]: And exploitation. [WC]: Correct. [JM]: Absolute exploitation of people's ignorance. Somewhere along the line, and as I said to you before a few minutes ago, the greatest enemy this country will ever face ‐‐ the people who are behind the scenes of government in this country ‐‐ their greatest enemy is you. You who think too much...as a matter of fact, there was a movie, there was a motion picture called...oh, what was it, a few years back called Network , and in the movie, Network , at the end of the movie the star, that was a newsman, and he said something to the effect that you don't have to worry about America being destroyed, America's not going anywhere because we feed everybody. So if we go, the whole world goes because we're feeding everybody. But there is something that is lost forever. There is something that has gone, and is legitimately lost, and that is your freedom as an individual human being to be free, to do your own thinking, to be your own person. That is lost. You have been taken over and you don't even know it. And he said the reason why is because you don't read, you don't think, you want to be entertained by Bugs Bunny and Big Top Pee ‐ wee , all you want is your recappable tires (laughs) like he says, and all of your creature comforts, and you don't want to put yourself out and so, consequently...[commas?] the law of [comma?] of cause and effect. You have not defended your freedoms, and if you don't defend your freedoms and your rights, then you don't have any. [WC]: That's correct. Now, let's go back to the symbology and we're talking about the back, the reverse seal of the United States of America. [JM]: Right. [WC]: We see at the top of this pyramid ‐‐ which, by the way, does not have a capstone ‐‐ we see an eye surrounded by rays, and this eye signifies, really in the beginning, signified the sun. 192"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"[JM]: Yeah, of course. Of course, the god of the sun. [WC]: That's correct, and we see that same symbol as the insignia for CBS. [JM]: Mmm ‐ hmm, CBS eye, that's right. [WC]: (laughs) And we also see, in the NBC peacock, a tail and each feather of the tail is an eye on it. And we also see the symbol of one of the information computer networks, America Online is the pyramid with the, again, all ‐ seeing eye. [JM]: Oh yes, it's everywhere. [WC]: We see the symbol of Prodigy, which is another computer information service... [JM]: Right. [WC]: ...which has as its symbol the pentagram. [JM]: Of course. [WC]: And by the way, folks, there's been a lawsuit brought against Prodigy because it has been discovered that, as you sign on to the Prodigy computer bulletin board database system, built into the program that they send you so you can sign on to this system and use it, is a method whereby they actually read the information on your personal hard drive on your personal computer. And I don't know where they go...where that goes or what they do with it, but there has been a lawsuit that's been brought against Prodigy for...they've been caught in the act is what I'm trying to tell you. [JM]: Yes, right. [WC]: And it's in court right now. We'll let you know how that's resolved and what happens, but I will tell you, if you're signing on to some of these national computer information database systems, there's a good chance that... [JM]: You're the one that's being...(laughs) [WC]: You're the one that is begin... [JM]: ...computerized. [WC]: ...probed for information while you think that you're probing them for information. It's actually the other way around, and it's setup intentionally that way. [JM]:I had an interesting conversation with a very high ranking rabbi in America about three or four years ago. And he had written a book, and I was very interested in it, about symbolism, or occult symbolism in America. Some of the interesting things he brought out was the movie, Frankenstein . If you break the word down, \"Frank ‐ en ‐ stein,\" and it goes back to Jacob Frank, and Jacob Frank in Europe was among the leading members of the Illuminati in Europe. And the idea was is that, in the old movie, Boris Karloff comes out and tells you, in the old original 1933 movie of Frankenstein , he comes out and says that this is a story about a old [sic] mad scientist at Bavarian University of Ingolstadt, and he has put together all of these nefarious pieces and created a monster, and that's what \"Frank ‐ en ‐ stein\" meant. And the rabbi was bringing out that all this...this story of Frankenstein was is that Bavarian professor, Adam Weishaupt, had put together a Frankenstein monster to frighten the world, and what he did is he used different people and put them together, the different pieces, into a monster. And so, Hollywood has known these stories. Hollywood is totally aware of all of these symbolism [sic] that's, you know, that's behind these stories. And so, I'm saying there is no way we are going to remain a free people without facing the facts that it's an educated electorate. We love to go around talking about how we have to right to elect. Boy, in America, we have to right to elect, but we don't have the right to SEE ‐ lect. That's what the problem is. So, without education, without knowledge and understanding, which comes from many hours of study and listening and understanding and researching on your own, we're not going to remain a free people. [WC]: And that's really the key, is not to believe anything that you hear from anyone, including me, including you... [JM]: Absolutely. [WC]: ...including your own mother. People have got to learn to start digging up and researching and studying... 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"[JM]: All of this on their own. [WC]: Absolutely. [JM]: And then you make it your own. Then you will finally see how we have been had as a people. And believe me, we are in serious trouble, because...the secret societies, the Masonic orders today, when I have asked these Freemasons who is it that is actually running your organization, they will tell you that they have a name for them. They're called the \"hidden masters\". [WC]: The hidden supervisors, the... [JM]: The hidden supervisors, the hidden masters... [WC]: ...and it's always nine... [JM]: Right, right. [WC]: ...and that goes back to the legend of the beginning of the Order of the Rose and Cross... [JM]: Right. [WC]: ...and Hiram Abiff, and the whole works, all the way back into history, that there is a round table of nine somewhere who's guiding all the machinations of the secret societies, leading to a one ‐ world government. Now, I don't know if these nine people really exist. [JM]: It doesn't matter. What we do know... [WC]: That's exactly right. It doesn't matter. (laughs) [JM]: It doesn't matter. But what we do know is that it is organized, it is orchestrated and there is a method to the madness. [WC]: That's correct. [JM]: And it may not make any sense to you, because you don't know what's going on. But if you were on the inner sanctums [sic] of these criminals, as they are planning their criminology throughout the world and their bloodshed [sic], if you were a fly on the wall meeting with these criminals, then you would see that the things which are happening in the world make sense. [WC]: That's correct. And also, one of the methods that they manipulate us is to turn us against each other. [JM]: Absolutely. [WC]: Racism is a form of this. [JM]: Yes. [WC]: Getting different religions to fight against each other is a form of this. [JM]: But that's a protection to them. As long as you're out fighting somebody else, you're not joining forces to uncover them. [WC]: It's part of the... [JM]: Plan. [WC]: ...detraction.. [JM]: Right. [WC]: ...the illusion, so that we're not looking in the right corner to see the cockroaches doing the real damage... [JM]: Absolutely. 194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"[WC]: ...when they crawl out from under the sink at midnight. [JM]: And that's a very good analogy, because that's just what they are. They're cockroaches. [WC]: (laughs) [JM]: One of the most...and, as a matter of fact, they have symbolism in words, as I said, and I want to throw this one at you. In California, we have something called a criminal justice system. Think about it, it's a criminal justice system. And they know what they're doing, I mean, they have this thing back in Georgia called the...what is it? The Center of Disease Control. It's not the Center for Disease Eradication, it's the Center of Disease Control. The whole...the way that we have grown up in this country, accepting symbols, emblems, words, institutions, government symbols, we need to educate yourselves that there's a whole world of knowledge there that we have not been privy to know. [WC]: Well, their concept of us, meaning the normal, everyday guy, and I consider myself to be in that category. [JM]: Right. [WC]: I'm just like everybody else out there. Probably, if I never had been a member of the Office of Naval Intelligence, I would never have caught on to any of this and would not be doing what I'm doing right now. So, I'm no different than the average listener out there. It's just that one day I woke up, looked myself in the mirror and said, \"Bill, you've been stupid for all of your life.\" I'm not going to be stupid anymore. Now I've got to do something smart. I've got to wise up, and that's really the only thing that separates me from most other people. So...but, their concept of us is that we're like animals, like cattle. That we don't have any intelligence. [JM]: Precisely, that's why that say that our offspring are \"kids\". We have kids. [WC]: And they rub it in our face. [JM]: Absolutely.

[reading from America's Assignment with Destiny , written by Manly P. Hall]: (start of quote) ===================================================== Those desiring substantial evidence of the unfoldment of the Great Plan should follow the suggestion inscribed upon the monument to Christopher Wren in Saint Paul's Cathedral, and gaze about them. The rapid advancement in the social and political states of man, the increasing richness of human living, and the broadening vision toward individual and collective responsibility herald, with auroral colors, the rising [of the] sun of truth. There is much yet to be accomplished, but already the achievement is impressive. Even the most devout humanist cannot survey the orderly progress of the race and at the same time deny the existence of a well ‐ integrated program. The light of the ancient Vedas is slowly but surely illuminating the whole world. The vision of man's noble destiny and the sacred sciences which made possible the realization of that vision have been guarded and served by \"the Silent Ones of the earth.\" The priesthoods of the sacerdotal colleges, the hierophants of the Mystery Schools, and the adept ‐ masters of the Secret Societies have been the guardians of man's noblest purpose ‐‐ the perfection of his own kind. It is the inalienable right of every honorable person to be grateful for the opportunities which progress bestows. With this appreciation comes also an appropriate measure of resolution. The past proves the future, which is but the extension of good works toward their fullness. The Mystery Schools neither restrained nor limited the unfoldment of human institutions. Man fashioned his civilization according to his natural instincts and convictions. [And] this process must continue, for growth is not hastened by the interference of authority. Man substantiates with his mind and heart that which he fashions with his hands. The esoteric tradition ensouls \"the ordinary works,\" revealing the larger purposes through the smaller ones. Not so long ago, ninety percent of the population of the earth was in physical slavery. Having liberated his body, the audacious creature must now free his heart and mind. Thus, pressed on by a sovereign necessity, the world conqueror becomes the self ‐ conqueror. Under a democratic concept of living, the responsibilities for progress pass to the keeping of the people. The powers vested in the governing body functioning with the consent of the governed include not only provisions for collective security, but also the advancement of such religions, philosophers, arts, and sciences as contribute to the essential growth of human character. An administrative system which ignores ethics, culture, and morality cannot survive as a dominant political organism. Democratic institutions must accept the task for which they were fashioned and become the conscious custodians of the democratic destiny. Progress demands the most from those with the largest spheres of influence. Vast organizations, industrial, political, social, and educational, have been made possible by the modern life ‐ way. These have become the molders of public opinion, feared or respected according to the measure of integrity revealed in their management. The future of human society is intimately associated with the destinies of these vast enterprises which have inherited, along with physical success, the duty or, more correctly, the privilege of world guardianship. Even the continuance of the economic theory now demands the strengthening of ethical convictions. Prominence of any 197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"kind, whether bestowed by wealth or authority, carries with it priestly obligations. The leader, whatever be his field, is looked upon for intelligent guidance. His convictions inspire his followers, his words influence their lives, and his policies dominate their activities. There is every indication that the esoteric tradition will next function through that complex of vast interrelated organisms of production and distribution which now dominates human imagination. While this structure may appear to the superficial ‐ minded as heartless and soulless, it is also the largest and most powerful potential instrument for the advancement of mankind ever yet devised. Education, science, and economics are today indivisible. They have already formed a partnership for their mutual advancement. Equipped with knowledge, skill, and the necessary physical resources, this huge combine awaits the destiny for which it was intended. There is no virtue in burdening the future with the conclusions of today. To prophecy is to restrict, not the will of heaven, but the mind of man. Old principles, as they reveal more of themselves, will be given new names; and progress is always an adjustment of concepts, each of which is in a constant state of change. Assuming, however, that the term democracy, with its numerous imponderable overtones, conveys a conviction of natural unfoldment, it is reasonable to infer that the democratic motion will continue until all of its potentials have become potencies. Progress is not bound inevitably to any nation or people. Social and political structures are instruments for the advancement of the Great Work only to the degree that they keep the faith. If ambition or selfishness breaks the bond, the privilege of guardianship is forfeited. This does not mean that the project fails; rather, that which fails the project loses the privilege of leadership. The Plan then passes to the keeping of other groups and other ages. Man cannot destroy or pervert the works of destiny. He can only divide himself from those works, and by so doing cease to share in the essential vitality of progress. Thus it is that unreasonable doubts and fears concerning providence are philosophically unsound. Failure is always regrettable, but principles do not fail, and that which is foreordained perfects itself. Although empires may collapse, great teachers be martyred, schools and systems perish, and enlightened leaders remain unhonored, the substance of the Great Work remains unchanged and unchangeable. New vehicles appear, even as the older ones are betrayed by human selfishness. The Eternal Commonwealth is an assignment of destiny, and spiritual progress, symbolized by the fabled phoenix, rises victoriously from the ashes of the human ruin. The adept tradition has always available social instruments waiting to be ensouled with the larger vision. All things created by men are mortal and destructible, but the way destined by heaven is immortal and indestructible. Universal enlightenment and universal fraternity are the natural ends which reward the social struggle. The world and all that inhabits it are moving triumphantly toward peace and security. At any given time the vision may be obscured, but in the larger dimensions of time, all things work together for the fulfillment of the greater good. ===================================================== (end of quote) Is that a piece of excellent, retrospective writing, looking back on history? No, ladies and gentlemen it is not, for this was written by Manly P. Hall in Los Angeles, California in April of 1951. What he predicted is what is happening. A wedding, a marriage between the corporate world and the state, which is coming. He's talking, here, about Socialism under a democratic concept of living; the responsibilities for progress passed to the keeping of the people. The powers vested in the governing body functioning with the consent of the governed include not only provisions for collective security, but also the advancement of such religions, philosophies, arts, and science as contribute to the essential growth of human character. Humanism : the concept that man will become god, and the new religion will change with the needs of man ‐‐ not man conforming to the laws of God. Democratic institutions must accept the task for which they were fashioned and become the conscious custodians of the democratic destiny, and so on and so forth. Manly P. Hall was an adept, a highly degreed ‐‐ in fact, he was a 33rd degree Freemason...may of held many, many other degrees in the Secret Societies of Mystery Babylon. He was a priest of the Order. Now, get comfortable. Make sure that you have everything that you need, folks, because I'm going to take you with me on a journey back to the beginning of all that is. And we are going to come forward from that point to the present, so that you will finally have an understanding of America's Assignment with Destiny . (Music playing: theme music from the movie Blade Runner , written by Vangelis) [continuing reading from America's Assignment with Destiny ]: 198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"(start of quote) ===================================================== Three great culture heroes were associated with the origin of Mayan civilization: Votan, who founded the Votanic Empire seated at Palanque; Itzama (Zamna), the Yucatecan hero; and Kulkulkan, whose worship extended throughout the Central American area. All three came from a remote region lying eastward, introduced arts and sciences, and founded religious cults or Mysteries. From the legendary histories of these persons, they should be included as adepts or initiates of ancient Secret Schools, possibly Atlantean. In a book written in the Quichean language and attributed to Votan, the great one declared himself \"a snake,\" a descendent of Imos of the line of Chan. He came to America, by the command of God, from a distant place. He ultimately founded Palanque, and built a temple with many subterranean chambers, which was called the House of Darkness. Here he deposited the records of his nation in the keeping of certain aged men called guardians. There is a legend[, folks,] that this Votan was the grandson of Noah. The original book containing this report was in the possession of Nunex de la Vega, Bishop of Chiapas, but he destroyed it with the other native manuscripts which he was able to accumulate. Fortunately, however, it had been copied by Aguilar. Itzamna, according to Cogullodo, was a priest who came with the migrations from the east. He was the son of the supreme deity, Hunab ‐ Ku ([or] the holy one). Itzamna is pictured as an ancient man with a very prominent and strangely shaped nose, either toothless or with one crooked fang. Likenesses of him have been found indicating his birth from a plant growing from the earth. He is also shown rising from the mouth of a serpent or a turtle, to symbolize that he came from the sea. He healed the sick and restored the dead to life. He lived, according to the records, to a great age, and was said to have been buried at Izamal ([or] Itzamal), where his tombs became places of pilgrimages. Itzamna was sometimes called \"the Skillful Hand.\" [And] after his death, his body was divided. His skillful hand was placed in one temple, his heart in another, and the rest of his remains in a third. One of the best known of his emblems was a Tau or T cross. It is now generally admitted that the Quetzalcoatl of the Nahuatlan people the Gucumatz of the Quiches, and the Kulkulkan of the more southern Mayas were one person. In each language, the word signifies feathered, plumed, or winged serpent . This title may have resulted from Quetzalcoatl casting his lot among, or gathering his first followers from, the descendants of Votan. This tribal group had the serpent as its heraldic device. At a remote time this semi ‐ mystical, semi ‐ divine priest ‐ initiate Quetzalcoatl came from the fabled land of the \"seven colors\" and established his rite at Tulla and Cholula. Quetzalcoatl was the initiate ‐ philosopher and teacher of the Nahuatlan tribes of Central Mexico. Among the appelations of this priest ‐ prophet ‐ king are \"he who was born of the virgin,\" \"Lord of the Winds,\" and \"the Divine Incarnation.\" Quetzalcoatl was the son of the universal creator ‐ god and the virgin Sochiquetzal, and his conception was made known by an ambassador from the god of the Milky Way. Torquemada, in his Indian Monarchies , described a band of people who came from the north dressed in long black robes. Arriving at Tulla, these strangers were well received; but finding the region already thickly Populated, they continued to Cholula. These wanderers were great artists, and skilled in working metals. Quetzalcoatl was their leader. Mendieta, in his Ecclesiastical History , described Quetzalcoatl as a white man with a strong formation of body, broad forehead, large eyes, and a flowing beard. He wore a miter on his head, and was dressed in a long white robe reaching to his feet, and covered with a design of red crosses. In his hand he held a sickle. His habits were ascetic; he never married, and was most chaste and pure in his life, and is said to have endured penance in a neighboring mountain, not for its effect upon himself, mid you, but as an example to others. He condemned sacrifices, except of fruit or flowers, and was known as the god of peace; for when addressed on the subject of war, he is reported to have stopped his ears with his fingers. Fray Bernardino de Sahagun described Quetzalcoatl as very homely, with a long head and a very long beard. There was a recumbent statue of him in the temple at Tulla which was always covered with blankets. \"His vassals,\" writes the good Fray, \"were all workmen in the mechanic arts and skillful in cutting the green stones called Chalchivites, also in the art of smelting silver and making other objects. All these arts had their origin and commencement with Quetzalcoatl, who had houses made with these precious green stones called Chalchivites and others made of silver, still others made of red and white shells, others all made of boards, and again others of turquoises, and some all made of rich plumes... \"Quetzalcoatl also owned all the wealth of the world in gold, silver, and the green stones called Chalchivites, and other precious things; and had a great abundance of cocoa ‐ trees of different colors, which are called xochicacatlao. The said vassals of Quetzalcoatl were also very wealthy, and did not lack anything at all; they never suffered famine or lack of corn; [in fact] they never ate even the small ears of corn, but rather heated their baths with them, using them instead of firewood. They also say that the said Quetzalcoatl did penance by pricking his limbs and drawing blood, with which he stained the maguey points; that he bathed at midnight in a spring called xicapaya.\" The interpreter of the Codex Telleriano ‐ Remensis said that Quetzalcoatl was created by the breath of Tonacatecotli. Quetzalcoatl was born on the day of Seven Canes, and disappeared or died on the day of One Cane. He was identified with the planet Venus. The Codex 199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Vaticanus A. says that the hero founded four temples: the first for the princes; the second for the people; the third, the House of Fear or Serpents; and the fourth, the Temple of Shame. The Codex Chimalpopca says that Quetzalcoatl was born as a nine ‐ year ‐ old child. When he resolved to leave Mexico, he reached the seashore, and, removing his clothing and his snake mask of turquoise, destroyed himself by fire. His ashes changed into birds, and his heart became the morning star. He remained four days in the underworld and four days as a corpse. After that he ascended to heaven as a god. It is specifically mentioned by Sahagun that Quetzalcoatl created and built houses under the earth. [Now] traces of subterranean grottoes and rooms have been discovered in the vicinity of most of the architectural monuments of the Nahuas. There is a vast complex of such apartments near the Pyramid of the Sun at San Juan Teotihuacan. The Amerindians believed the serpent to be an earth dweller, and it is quite possible that the accounts implied these subterranean and secret places to be chambers of initiation into the mysteries of the cult. According to de Bourbourg, the Mexican demigod Votan made a journey through a subterranean passage which, running under ground, terminated at the root of heaven. This passage was \"a snake's hole,\" and Votan was admitted because he was himself \"a son of the snake.\" Quetzalcoatl appeared as the great sorcerer, magician, or necromancer. He performed miracles, and upon his departure his secrets were entrusted to an Order of priests governed by a hierophant or Master. This priesthood practiced the arts and sciences, treated the sick, administered sacraments, and were diviners and prophets. Landa gives some consideration to the activities of these religious Orders. Lucien Biart summarizes the available data [thusly]: \"The most contradictory ideas have been current in regard to this divinity, who, now considered of celestial origin, and now regarded as a man who had acqu...He certainly belonged to a race other than the one he civilized; of that there can be no doubt, but what was his country? He died, announcing that he would return at the head of white ‐ faced men; and we have seen that the Indians believed his prophecy fulfilled when the Spaniards landed on their shores [and of course we have seen the consequences of that action.] According to Sahagun, the most usual ornaments of the images of Quetzalcoatl were a miter spotted like the skin of a tiger, a short embroidered tunic, turquoise earrings, and a golden collar supporting fine shells. The legs of these images were encased in gaiters of tiger ‐ skins, and on their feet were black sandals. A shield hung from the left arm, and in the right hand was a scepter ornamented with precious stones, an emblem which terminated in a crook like a bishop's crosier.\" Quetzalcoatl is credited with the invention of the pictorial or hieroglyphical method of writing, and especially is his name associated with the Tonalamatl , or Book of Fate . This was more than a civil calendar and was reserved for the calculation of human destiny and prophecies concerning the future of the State. It was used by \"master magicians,\" the chief of whom was an astrological adept credited with extraordinary occult powers. While it is likely that Quetzalcoatl brought the Tonalamatl back to Mexico after his journey among the Mayas, a people already advanced in such matters, the Aztecan legend has been summarized by Mendieta. The gods had created a man, Oxomoco, and a woman, Cipactonatl, as the progenitors of the human race. They [according to the legend] dwelt in a cave at Cuernavaca, and in order to regulate their lives these two resolved to devise a calendar. Cipactonatl felt that her descendant, Quetzalcoatl, should be invited to participate in the project. Because she was the mother of all the living and a great prophetess, Cipactonatl was privileged to select and write the first sign or day ‐ symbol of the calendar. The others followed until the thirteen signs were completed. Sahagun, in his General History , gave a number of details of the struggle between Quetzalcoatl, the civilizer, and Tezcatlipoca, who apparently signified the primitive and sanguine religious cult of Mexico. The old priesthood, which practiced human sacrifice and adhered to a policy of war and destruction, resented the peaceful and gentle faith brought by Quetzalcoatl. In the end, Tezcatlipoca, the personification of the sorcerers, contrived to poison the god ‐ king, which implies that his doctrines were corrupted by false teachings and interpretations. The poison worked slowly and insidiously, until Quetzalcoatl, realizing that he could not combat successfully the old perverted priesthood, left Tulla, ordering his palaces of gold and silver, turquoise and precious stones to be set afire. Accompanied by a procession of musicians, youths, and maidens bearing flowers, and flocks of singing birds, the old adept journeyed to Cholula, where the great pyramid was built in his honor. It was written that the Cholulans deeply admired the great priest because of the purity of his life, the kindliness of his manner, and his doctrines of peace and brotherhood. He remained with them for nearly twenty years, slowly sickening from the poison which was destroying his body. At last he realized that his ministry was coming to an end, so he continued his long journey toward the mysterious city of Tlapallan from which he had come. He turned toward the east and proceeded to the sea, which he reached at a point a few miles south of Veracruz. Here he blessed the four young men who had accompanied him and bade them return to their homes, with his promise that one day in the future he would return and restore his kingdom among them. ===================================================== (end of quote) 200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"It's time for our break, folks.

And, of course, I am going to learn as much I can from him. His official title around here is Research Assistant. Mr. Tom Swift will continue with the rest of tonight’s program. [Tom Swift]: Where we left off: [Tom Swift reading from America's Assignment with Destiny ]: (start of quote) ===================================================== [Quetzalcoatl had just promised] the four young men...that one day in the future he would return and restore his kingdom among them. Then the old and weary man called to the sea, and out of the waters came a raft of serpents. He stepped upon this strange craft and was carried away into the land of the sun's beginning. He left behind him a priesthood that perpetuated with esoteric rites the Mysteries of the Feathered Serpent. There is every indication that the cult of Quetzalcoatl was kept secret, a precaution necessary in the face of the opposition of the primitive indigenous sects. There are several accounts of the death or departure of Quetzalcoatl. The conflict is due in part to the legends being derived from different tribes, and in part to the Spanish methods of gathering the reports. These invaders took slight interest in the native traditions, until they had destroyed most of the available sources of information. Later, even the converted Indians were uncertain of their tribal history. There is reason to believe, however, that some sacred records were intentionally suppressed and were never available to the missionaries. The people of Mexico claim to have sacred accounts of the mysteries of their religion and the origin of their race. There is mention of the Divine Book written by Tezcucan, a wise man or wizard, whose name means Lord of the Great Hand. This was supposed to contain the account of the migration of the Aztecs from Asia. Baron de Waldeck claimed that the book had once been in his possession. De Bourbourg thought it was the Dresden Codex , and Bustamante wrote that native historians had a copy in their possession at the time of the fall of Mexico. There is good probability that manuscripts of great value survived the Spanish colonial period and are still available to certain qualified persons. Augustus LePlongeon, known to the Yucatecans as Great Black Beard, was one of the few Americanists to be accepted into the confidence of the ever ‐ reticent Indians. They told him enough to convince a thoughtful man of the existence of Esoteric Schools in the Mayan area. \"That sacred mysteries,\" writes LePlongeon, \"have existed in America from times immemorial, there can be no doubt.” Even setting aside the proofs of their existence, that we gather from the monuments of Uxmal, and the descriptions of the trials of initiation related in the sacred book of the Quiches, we find vestiges of them in various other countries of the Western Continent. \"The rites and ceremonies of initiation were imported to Peru by the ancestors of Manco Capac, the founder of the Inca dynasty, who were colonists from Central America, as we learn from an unpublished Manuscript, written by a Jesuit father, Rev. Anello Oliva, at the beginning of the year 1631, in Lima; and now in the library of the British Museum in London.\" A number of authors have tried to prove that Quetzalcoatl was a foreigner who, reaching the shores of the New World at an early time, attempted the civilization of the aboriginal tribes. Lord Kingsborough favored the possibility that this wanderer was the Apostle Thomas, and that the ancient Central American Indians came under Christian or Jewish influence. Always deeply concerned with the possibilities of linking the worship in the Americas with the religions of the Near East, his lordship writes: \"The Messiah is shadowed in the Old Testament under many types; such as those of a lion, a lamb, a rose, the morning star (or the planet Venus, otherwise called Lucifer), the sun, light, a rock, a stone, the branch, the vine, wine, bread, water, life, the way, and he 201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"is recognized in the triple character of a king, a priest, and a prophet. It is very extraordinary that Quetzalcoatl, whom the Mexicans believed equally to have been a king, a prophet, and a pontiff, should also have been named by them Seyacatl, or the morning star; Tlavizcalpantecutli, or light; Mexitli, or the vine (for Torquemada said that the core of the aloe, from which the Mexicans obtained wine, was so called); Votan, or the heart, metaphorically signifying life; and Toyliatlaquatl, ' manjar de nuestra veda, ' bread (for his body made of dough was eaten by the Mexicans).\" Las Casas, quoting Padre Francisco Hernandez, says that an old Yucatecan described the ancient religion of his people thus: \"That they recognized and believed in God who dwells in heaven, and that this God was Father and Son and Holy Spirit, and that the Father was called Icona, who had created men and all things, that the Son was called Bacab, and that he was born of a virgin called Chibirias, who is in heaven with God; the Holy Spirit they termed Echuac.\" The son Bacab was scourged and crowned with thorns, was tied upon a cross with extended arms, where he died; but after three days he arose and ascended into heaven to be with his father. Dr. Alexander, who reports this story in his book, is inclined that it is confused and probably distorted by the Spanish recorder. On the other hand, the universal distribution of this basic theme may be explained another way. Among the Lacandones, Quetzalcoatl is still represented as a snake with many heads. There is an account that this snake was killed and eaten at times of great national peril, especially at eclipses, which were regarded as portents of disaster. It was believed by the Mayas that Kulkulkan descended invisibly from the sky and personally received the offerings during certain great feasts held in his honor. Daniel Brinton, in his Essays of an Americanist , devoted some thought to the magical powers attributed to the priests of Central America. He mentioned Father Baeza and an English priest, Thomas Gage, who reported cases of sorcerers transforming themselves into animals, and performing miracles. De Bourbourg was not entirely convinced that ventriloquism, animal magnetism, or the tricks familiarly employed by conjurers explained the mysteries of nagualism, as the black art of these Indians is called. Brinton quotes from the Popul Vuh : \"Truly this Gucumatz Quetzalcoatl became a wonderful king. Every seven days he ascended to the sky, and every seven days he followed the path to the abode of the dead; every seven days he put on the nature of a serpent and he became truly a serpent; every seven days he put on the nature of an eagle and again of a tiger, and he became truly an eagle and a tiger;...\" It is evident from available authorities that the Mayas and Aztecs had an extensive body of legendary and lore, which originated in the mysteries of their religions and proves the existence of an elaborate system of secret rites and ceremonies. In the form of a feathered snake, Quetzalcoatl overshadowed a dynasty of rulers and priests, some of whom later assumed his name and even his mask ‐ symbol. These later Quetzalcoatls have been confused, like the several Zoroasters of Persia, into one person, with the resulting conflict in dates. Recent excavations would indicate that the cult of the feathered serpent was established before the beginning of the Christian Era and did not arise in the tenth or eleventh century A.D. as held by some modern archaeologists. It is more likely that the ancient hero was said to have been reborn or to have overshadowed a later leader of the nation. All the accounts imply that the religious Order which served the Mysteries of Quetzalcoatl was long established. Those who followed in the way which he had prescribed lived most severe lives. Children were consecrated to his temples from their birth and were marked by a special collar. At the end of the second year the child was scarified in the breast. When it was seven years old it entered a seminary where it took vows covering personal conduct and public duties, including prayers for the preservation of its family and its nation. There were many of these priestly Brotherhoods, and the Spanish missionaries, in spite of their theological prejudices and intolerances, were forced to admit that the Aztecan priests were excellent scholars and lived austere and pure lives. It was said of these missionaries that \"in Quetzalcoatl, who taught charity, gentleness, and peace, they thought they saw a disciple of Jesus Christ.\" The kings of the Mexican nations, like those of ancient Egypt, were also initiates of the State Mysteries. Torquemada described the attainments of Nazahualpilli, the king of Texcuco. This learned man gathered about him masters of the sciences and arts, and gained a wide reputation as an astrologer and seer. When Montezuma was elected to rule over the complex of Nahuatlan nations, King Nazahualpilli stood before the young man and congratulated the entire nation for having selected such a ruler: \"Whose deep knowledge of heavenly things insured to his subjects his comprehension of those of an earthly nature.\" The interpreter of the Collection of Mendoza described Montezuma as: \"By nature wise, an astrologer and philosopher, and skilled and generally versed in all of the arts, both in those of the military, as well as those of a civil nature, and from his extreme gravity and state, the monarchy under his sway began to verge towards empire.\" The great serpent clothed in quetzal plumes certainly belonged to another race and came from an unknown country. Lucien Biart says: \"It is an incontestable fact that Quetzalcoatl created a new religion, based upon fasting, penitence, and virtue.\" In skillful trades and in metalworking, this Amerindian savior reminds one of the craftsman of Tyre who cast the ornaments for Solomon's Temple.

The Aztecs inhabiting the valley of Mexico certainly derived much of their cultural impetus from the more highly civilized Mayas. These Nahuas practiced elaborate rites and ceremonies, and recognized a large pantheon of divinities. It seems unlikely that the Aztecs patterned their religious concepts from some inferior cultural tradition. There are positive indications that the tribes of Central Mexico had received an important intellectual stimulus from the Mayas, and even found it expedient to acknowledge this indebtedness. The physical remains of the Mayan civilization are sufficiently impressive to indicate a highly advanced people, whose religious institutions and rites had reached a considerable degree of refinement. Most early writers, in an attempt to estimate the cultural attainments of these nations, have been over influenced by the early theologians and scientific enthusiasts who invaded the field with a variety of concepts and preconceptions. The empires of the Mayas and Aztecs were resplendent with edifices dedicated to their faiths. There were magnificent shrines, temples, and altars, some to sanguinary deities, and others to benign and kindly gods. The State Mysteries, however, were seldom performed in the sanctuaries of popular worship. Neophytes traveled to remote places, and if they went uninvited, seldom returned. Throughout the jungles are the ruins of extraordinary buildings constructed for unknown purposes. The Mysteries of Xibalba, as recorded in the Popul Vuh , and traditionally associated with the culture ‐ hero Votan, were given in such an architectural complex, which served as an entrance to a mysterious world beyond the dimensions of the material mind. Such \"gateways\" existed in all the old countries where the Mystery religion originally flourished. Obviously, archaeologists cannot discover the secret rites merely by grubbing among the overturned and broken stones. As the priesthoods were not considerate enough to label their monuments, there is little left today even to excite curiosity. Fortunately, however, the esoteric tradition survives in the racial subconscious, and its violated schools and colleges need not be physically restored. When such restoration is attempted, the buildings usually reveal that they were designed as symbols of the cosmos. If the Mystery system actually existed in the Western Hemisphere, as the landmarks seem to indicate, it must have produced by its initiates and by its adepts. These, in turn, became the leaders and saviors of their peoples. The wonder ‐ working hero, whose deeds enriched all tribal traditions, always and everywhere performed the exact same miracles, possessed the exact same powers, and made the exact same personal sacrifices. The Mystery School required not only a hierarchy for its maintenance and perpetuation, but also appropriate places of initiation partly underground or adjacent to grottoes and caverns. It required also a body of lore peculiarly significant, participation in which conferred special rights and privileges. A people which had reached this mental platform of the Mayas would not have accepted a philosophy of life that was without profound and significant values. Pagan priesthoods did not initiate those of feeble mind, but selected for spiritual advancement persons of high attainment and mature judgment. Albert Reville, in the Hibbard Lectures , 1894, notes of the religion of the plumed serpent: \"There was something mysterious and occult about the priesthood of this deity, as though it were possessed of divine secrets or promises, the importance of which it would be dangerous to undervalue.\" It is fortunate, indeed, that at least one manuscript relating to the religious Mysteries formerly practiced in the Mayan area has been recovered. The Popul Vuh , or The Senate Book of the Quiches , the Record of the Community, has survived the numerous vicissitudes which have conspired to prevent the perpetuation of the literary monuments of Central America. It was tolerated by the early missionaries who, observing certain similarities to their own Scriptures, preserved the work as a means of persuading the Indians to a more speedy baptism. In the seventeenth century, it was rescued from a fate worse than oblivion by the Dominican monk, Don Ramon de Ordonez y Aguiar, dean and chancellor of the archbishopric of Ciudad Real. This work was deposited in the library of the convent at Chichicastenango by its scholiast, Ximenes, where it remained until they year 1830. ============================================== (end of quote) [William Cooper speaking]: Thank you, Tom.

[reading from America's Assignment with Destiny , written by Manly P. Hall]: (start of quote) ===================================================== It was written that the Cholulans deeply admired [Quetzalcoatl] the great priest because of the purity of his life, the kindliness of his manner, and his doctrines of peace and brotherhood. He remained with them for nearly twenty years, slowly sickening from the poison which was destroying his body. At last he realized that his ministry was coming to an end, so he continued his long journey toward the mysterious city of Tlapallan from which he had come. He turned toward the east and proceeded to the sea, which he reached at a point a few miles south of Veracruz. Here he blessed the four young men who had accompanied him and bade them return to their homes, with his promise that one day in the future he would return and restore his kingdom among them. Then the old and weary man called to the sea, and out of the waters came a raft of serpents. He stepped upon this strange craft and was carried away into the land of the sun's beginning. He left behind him a priesthood that perpetuated with esoteric rites the Mysteries of the Feathered Serpent. There is every indication[, folks] that the cult of Quetzalcoatl was kept secret, a precaution necessary in the face of the opposition of the primitive indigenous sects. There are several accounts of the death or departure of Quetzalcoatl. The conflict is due in part to the legends being derived from different tribes, and in part to the Spanish methods of gathering the reports. [Now,] these invaders took slight interest in the native traditions, until they had destroyed most of the available sources of information. Later, even the converted Indians were uncertain of their tribal history. There is reason to believe, however, that some sacred records were intentionally suppressed and were never available to the missionaries. The people of Mexico claim to have sacred accounts of the mysteries of their religion and the origin of their race. There is mention of the Divine Book written by Tezcucan, a wise man or wizard, whose name means Lord of the Great Hand. This was supposed to contain the account of the migration of the Aztecs from Asia. Baron de Waldeck claimed that the book had once been in his possession. De Bourbourg thought it was the Dresden Codex , and Bustamante wrote that native historians had a copy in their possession at the time of the fall of Mexico. [Now,] there is good probability that manuscripts of great value survived the Spanish colonial period and are still available to certain qualified persons. Augustus LePlongeon, known to the Yucatecans as Great Black Beard, was one of the few Americanists to be accepted into the confidence of the ever ‐ reticent Indians. They told him enough to convince a thoughtful man of the existence of Esoteric Schools in the 206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Mayan area. \"That sacred mysteries,\" writes LePlongeon, \"have existed in America from times immemorial, there can be no doubt. Even setting aside the proofs of their existence, that we gather from the monuments of Uxmal, and the descriptions of the trials of initiation related in the sacred book of the Quiches, we find vestiges of them in various other countries of the Western Continent. \"The rites and ceremonies of initiation were imported in Peru by the ancestors of Manco Capac, the founder of the Inca dynasty, who were colonists from Central America, as we learn from an unpublished [manuscript], written by a jesuit father, Red. Anello Oliva, at the beginning of the year 1631, in Lima; and now [it resides] in the library of the British Museum in London.\" A number of authors have tried to prove that Quetzalcoatl was a foreigner who, reaching the shores of the New World at an early time, attempted the civilization of the aboriginal tribes. Lord Kingsborough favored the possibility that this wanderer was the Apostle Thomas, and that the ancient Central American Indians came under Christian or Jewish influence. Always deeply concerned with the possibilities of linking the worship in the Americas with the religions of the Near East, his lordship writes: \"The Messiah is shadowed in the Old Testament under many types; such as those of a lion, a lamb, a roe, the morning star (or the planet Venus, otherwise called Lucifer), the sun, light, a rock, a stone, the branch, the vine, wine, bread, water, life, the way, and he is there recognized in the triple character of a king, a priest, and a prophet. It is very extraordinary that Quetzalcoatl, whom the Mexicans believed equally to have been a king, a prophet, and a pontiff, should also have been named by them Ceyacatl, or the morning star; Tlavizcalpantecutli, or light; Mexitli, or the vine (for Torquemada said that the core of the aloe, from which the Mexicans obtained wine, was so called); Votan, or the heart, metaphorically signifying life; and Toyliatlaquatl, ' manjar de nuestra veda ,' bread (for his body made of dough was eaten by the Mexicans).\" Las Casas, quoting Padre Francisco Hernandez, says that an old Yucatecan described the ancient religion of his people thus: \"That [they] recognized and believed in God who dwells in heaven, and that this God was Father and Son and Holy Spirit, and that the Father was called Icona, who had created men and all things, that the Son was called Bacab, and that he was born of a virgin called Chibirias, who is in heaven with God; the Holy Spirit they termed Echuac.\" The son Bacab was scourged and crowned with thorns, was tied upon a cross with extended arms, where he died; but after three days he arose and ascended into heaven to be with his father. Dr. Alexander, who reports this story in his book, is inclined to feel that it is confused and probably distorted by the Spanish recorder. On the other hand, the universal distribution of the basic theme may be explained another way. Among the Lacandones, Quetzalcoatl is still represented as a snake with many heads. There is an account that this snake was killed and eaten at times of great national peril, especially at eclipses, which were regarded as portents of disaster. It was believed by the Mayas that Kulkulkan descended invisibly from the sky and personally received the offerings during certain great feasts held in his honor. (For details [of this,] consult The Mythology of All Ages, Vol. XI, Latin American , by Hartley Burr Alexander.) [Now,] Daniel Brinton, in his Essays of an Americanist , devoted some thought to the magical powers attributed to the priests of Central America. He mentioned Father Baeza and an English priest, Thomas Gage, who reported cases of sorcerers transforming themselves into animals, and performing [other] miracles. De Bourbourg was not entirely convinced that ventriloquism, animal magnetism, or the tricks familiarly employed by conjurers explained the mysteries of nagualism, as the black art of these Indians is called. Brinton quotes from the Popul Vuh : \"Truly this Gucumatz [Quetzalcoatl] became a wonderful king. Every seven days he ascended to the sky, and every seven days he followed the path to the abode of the dead; every seven days he put on the nature of a serpent and he became truly a serpent; every seven days he put on the nature of an eagle and again of a tiger, and he became truly an eagle and a tiger;...\" It is evident from available authorities that the Mayas and Aztecs had an extensive body of legendary and lore, which originated in the mysteries of their religions and proves the existence of an elaborate system of secret rites and ceremonies. In the form of a feathered snake, Quetzalcoatl overshadowed a dynasty of rulers and priests, some of whom later assumed his name and even his mask ‐ symbol. These later Quetzalcoatls have been confused, like the several Zoroasters of Persia, into one person, with the resulting conflict in dates. Recent excavations would indicate that the cult of the feathered serpent was established before the beginning of the Christian Era and did not arise in the tenth or eleventh century A.D. as held by some modern archaeologists. [In fact,] it is more likely that the ancient hero was said to have been reborn or to have overshadowed a later leader of the nation. All the accounts imply that the religious Order which served the Mysteries of Quetzalcoatl was long established. Those who followed in the way which he had prescribed lived most severe lives. Children were consecrated to his temples from their birth and were marked by a special collar. At the end of the second year the child was scarified in the breast. When it was seven years old it entered a seminary where it took vows covering personal conduct and public duties, including prayers for the preservation of its family and its nation. There were many of these priestly Brotherhoods, and the Spanish missionaries, in spite of their theological prejudices and intolerances, were forced to admit that the Aztecan priests were excellent scholars and lived austere and pure lives. It was said of these missionaries that \"in Quetzalcoatl, who taught charity, gentleness, and peace, they thought they saw a disciple of Jesus Christ.\" The kings of the Mexican nations, like those of ancient Egypt, were also initiates of the State Mysteries. Torquemada described the 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"attainments of Nazahualpilli, the king of Texcuco. This learned man gathered about him masters of the sciences and arts, and gained a wide reputation as an astrologer and seer. When Montezuma was elected to rule over the complex of Nahuatlan nations, King Nazahualpilli stood before the young man and congratulated the entire nation for having selected such a ruler: \"Whose deep knowledge of heavenly things insured to his subjects his comprehension of those of an earthly nature.\" The interpreter of the Collection of Mendoza described Montezuma as: \"By nature wise, an astrologer and philosopher, and skilled and generally versed in all the arts, both in those of the military, as well as those of a civil nature, and from his extreme gravity and state, the monarchy under his sway began to verge towards empire.\" The great serpent clothed in quetzal plumes certainly belonged to another race and came from an unknown country. Lucien Biart says: \"It is an incontestable fact that Quetzalcoatl created a new religion, based upon fasting, penitence, and virtue.\" In skillful trades and in metalworking, this Amerindian savior reminds one of the craftsman of Tyre who cast the ornaments for Solomon's Temple. As a benefactor of his people, as a liberator of men's minds and hearts, this Nahuatlan demigod certainly revealed the attributes of the \"Master Builder.\" [William Cooper: Folks, are you beginning to hear the implications that this may be connected to the Ancient Mysteries and directly to Freemasonry? For that is exactly what Manly Hall is putting across.] Scattered through the jungle of Yucatan and extending northward into Chiapas and southward into Honduras and Guatemala are the remains of ancient cities and the ruins of old cultural centers, religious or educational, dedicated to scientific research and the investigation of the spiritual mysteries of human life. These shrines and temples are adorned with numerous religious emblems and figures, and closely resemble the temples and schools of the esoteric tradition which were scattered through the Mediterranean countries, North Africa, and the Near East.

There were magnificent shrines, temples, and altars, some to sanguinary deities, and others to benign and kindly gods.

The Popul Vuh , or The Senate Book of the Quiches , the Record of the Community, has survived the numerous vicissitudes which have conspired to prevent the perpetuation of the literary monuments of Central America. It was tolerated by the early missionaries who, observing certain similarities to their own Scriptures, preserved the work as a means of persuading the Indians to a more speedy baptism. In the seventeenth century, it was rescued from a fate worse than oblivion by the Dominican monk, Don Ramon de Ordonez y Aguiar, dean and chancellor of the archbishopric of Ciudad Real. The work was deposited in the library of the convent at Chichicastenango by its scholiast, Ximenes, where it remained until 1830. The manuscript of the Popul Vuh was rediscovered about 1855 by Dr. Scherzer in the library of the University of San Carlos, Guatemala City. Through the industry and scholarship of that ardent antiquarian, the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg, this mysterious book of the Quiches came at last to the French language, where it lingered for years awaiting English translation. Dr. Scherzer was responsible for a Spanish version published in Vienna in 1856. The first English translation has remained practically unknown to students of Central American archeology, as it appeared serially in The Word , a magazine devoted to Theosophical and related subjects. The translation was made by Kenneth S. Guthrie, M.A., Ph.D., M.D., and was based upon the French text. A new English translation from the Spanish of Adrian Recinos has just been issued by the University of Oklahoma Press [and, folks, that was in 1951]. This version is by Delia Goetz and Sylvanus G. Morley, and includes important introductory and commentary material. Writing under the pseudonym Aretas, James Pryse issued part of the Popul Vuh with learned commentaries under the title The Book of the Azure Veil . This ran in Lucifer , a theosophical magazine, between September 1894 and February 1895. It concluded with a note that circumstances made it impossible for the translator to finish the work. Pryse suggests that the god Quetzalcoatl was known in Peru under the name of Amaru. He writes: \"From the latter name comes our word America. Amaruca is, literally translated, 'Land of the Plumed Serpent.' The priests of this God of Peace, from their chief centre in the Cordilleras, once ruled both Americas. All the Red men who have remained true to the ancient religion are still under their sway. One of their strong centres was in Guatemala, and of their Order was the author of the book called Popul Vuh .\" Although Dr. Scherzer published his copy under the title Las Historias del origen de los Indios de Guatemala, par el R. P. F. Francisco Ximenes , this is misleading. Ximenes was not the author, but acted in the capacity of scribe, translator, and commentator. The work is said to have been compiled originally in the seventeenth century by a Guatemalan who had been converted to Christianity. Most American Indians are unsatisfactory converts, for they accept new beliefs without discarding old convictions. This is a most fortunate state of affairs, as there is little indication that the indigenous mythology has been compromised. The source of the material compiled by this convert is completely unknown, but it could well have been derived from a secret book or from oral tradition guarded in the sanctuaries of the Mysteries. [Now,] to have secured it, the compiler must himself have been a priest or initiate. Certainly, the Popul Vuh is by far the outstanding available text on pre ‐ Columbian mythology and cosmogony [existing]. The Quichean scribe, in his introduction to the Popul Vuh , writes: \"The following is what we shall write, and we place it in writing because, since the 'Word of God' has been promulgated, and hereafter during the cycle of Christianity, the Book of the Azure ‐ green ‐ veil is no longer to be seen, in which it could be clearly perceived that it had come from the further shore of the Sea; which Book has been called 'The Record of our existence in the Overshadowing World, and how we there beheld Light and Life.'\" ([Now] note [that] this translation by Pryse is somewhat fuller than that given by Guthrie, and seems to be more in the spirit of the Quiche tradition.) [And] the implication[, folks] is that the work originated behind the Azure Veil. This can have two meanings: either the veil which divides the spiritual universe from the material world, or the veil in the temple of initiation, behind which are the Seven Lords of the Great Heart. The Popul Vuh consists of a mythology gradually mingling in its descent with the beginnings of history. The early part deals almost entirely with superhuman beings, and the latter part with the heroic deeds of authentic personages. It opens with a description of the creation. All was calm and silent, and the face of the earth was not yet to be seen. In the eternal darkness and quietude was the Creator ‐‐ the Lord and Maker ‐‐ and Gucumatz, the plumed serpent. They were surrounded with green and azure, and they were those who engendered. Then \"The Word\" came and spake with them, and they joined their counsels. Those who engender then said: \"Let it be done. Let the waters retire and cease to obstruct, to the end that it be sown, and that the light of day shine in the heavens and upon the earth; for we shall receive neither glory nor honor from all that we have created and formed until human beings exist, endowed with sentience.\" Thus the Creator said: \"Earth,\" and immediately it was formed. The book proceeds much in the spirit of the Scriptures of other nations. It is divided generally into four parts: cosmogony, theogony, anthropology, and regeneration through initiation. It is presented in semihistorical form and includes the initiation of its heroes into the Mysteries of Xibalba. The heroes of the Popul Vuh are subjected to several ordeals or tests of courage, fortitude, and skill. The seventh test took place in the House of the Bat. This was a subterranean labyrinth inhabited by weird monsters and ruled over by Camazotz, a fearful creature with the 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"body of a man and the wings and head of a bat.

Don't go away. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation) (break music: theme music from the movie Blade Runner , written by Vangelis) [reading from America's Assignment with Destiny , written by Manly P. Hall]: (start of quote) ===================================================== The Popul Vuh follows the traditional form by involving its principle characters in a series of superhuman and supernatural adventures. The work is certainly an account of the \"perilous journey,\" which is the usual means employed to veil thinly the story of initiation. By comparison with the oral traditions of the Northern Amerindian tribes, the legend unfolds what Dr. Paul Radin beautifully calls \"the road of light.\" Medicine priests have freely acknowledged that in dreams and trances they could leave their bodies and travel to the abodes of the gods and the dead. To make this journey while still living is initiation, for it is conscious participation in the fact of immortality. In some cults the neophyte was given sacred drugs to intensify his psychic faculties, as in the case of the notorious Peyote sect, or was subjected to hypnotic influence, like the followers of the ghost ‐ shirt religion. By some means a condition of death was simulated and the consciousness or superior self passed through certain internal experiences, of which at least a partial memory was preserved. The entire process of creation took place within the green and azure coils of the plumed serpent. On several continents the serpent was among the important symbols of the initiate ‐ priest. Sometimes the serpent stands erect and is crowned, as in Egypt, or it may be winged as among the Mongolians, or feathered and plumed as throughout the Americas. Obviously, the natives did not intend to imply that they believed in the actual existence of winged snakes, for no such creatures ever existed among them. The serpent was a wisdom symbol, and when plumed it meant that wisdom had been given wings and had become spirit ‐ wisdom, or illumination. Pryse suggests that Matthew 10:16 explains the symbolism of the snake ‐ bird: \"Behold, I send you as sheep...into the midst of wolves...: be ye therefore wise as serpents..., guileless as doves....\" [William Cooper: Now, let me read the same passage from Matthew 10:16 again with the Mystery Religion meaning:] \"Behold, I send you as...[neophytes] into the midst of...[the profane]: be ye therefore wise as...[magicians], guileless as...[mystics].\" Mr. Pryse was a Greek scholar and his translation differed slightly from the King James Version [(laughs) as you can see]. He felt that the quetzal had the same meaning as dove, and that the creature combining the serpent ‐ wisdom and the bird ‐ intuition or ‐ inspiration represented the adept, in whom the mind and heart doctrine were completely reconciled. The conflict between the initiate and the adversary, or the paths of white and black magic, is always present. In the story of Deganawida, the power of evil was personified by Atotarho, an old war chieftain, who had a cluster of venomous serpents on his head in place of hair. The Mexican Quetzalcoatl was attacked by the red god of war. The adversary personified either older cults which opposed the establishment of the benevolent Mysteries or later cults responsible for the destruction of these institutions. In either case an inferior state of spiritual enlightenment was implied. The Mysteries were institutions of liberation and were naturally opposed by groups seeking to keep their people in bondage through ignorance. The struggle was, therefore, between religion as temporal authority and the 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Mystery faith ‐ the internal \"road of light.\" The ruins of the past explain why it was the common belief that the men of good spirit, the initiates, were sacrificed to the material ambitions of temporal rulers. [William Cooper: Now, folks, you can apply this same logic to the Mystery Religion of today, where they refer to the adversary. They are talking about the same religious institutions, governments and groups of people that Mr. Hall refers to in discussing the ancient Mystery Religions of the Aztecs and Mayans. Only in their modern writings, they will never disclose that.] All the aboriginal tribes of North America practiced mystical and magical rites, and vestiges of an esoteric tradition, served by a priestly class distinguished for sagacity and personal integrity, are still to be found among surviving groups. Scattered over a vast area and divided further by lack of a common language, these nomadic bands were approaching the horizon of national existence when the European colonists conquered their lands, decimated their tribes, and destroyed their cultural patterns. So diversified were the traditions of these peoples that it is difficult to summarize their beliefs and doctrines, especially after their legends, histories, and religious institutions were corrupted by outside influences. The European colonists were of no mind to search for the mystical secrets of the Indian \"life ‐ way.\" These settlers brought their own religious beliefs, which they were resolved to force upon the natives. There were no ethnologists or anthropologists among the Puritans, and many important landmarks of Indian philosophy were destroyed before the had been honestly investigated or appraised. Most of the tribal lore was in the keeping of priests and elders, and if these were killed or died without finding suitable successors the traditions ended. Even today older Indians find it difficult to select younger men to perpetuate the sacred institutions. Thus it is unwise to assume that from available fragments a complete picture of Indian mysticism can [ever] be reconstructed. The Indian has always been an individualist, and neither circumstance nor inclination induced him to form extensive intertribal organizations. His way of life and the vast silences of his homeland caused him to turn within himself for courage, wisdom, and faith. He could not visit distant shrines of learning or sit at the feet of famous teachers. There were no books to ponder and no ancient sages to guide his religious convictions. Few strangers visited his camp with news or opinions from places. He was part of a small family, and the tribal life, with its simple lore, was his only source of cultural tradition. A thoughtful observer of Nature about him, the Indian lived constantly in the presence of mysteries, with no reference frame other than his own imagination. Though stoical in appearance, he was highly emotional, as indicated by his songs, dances, and festivals. His sensory perceptions were acute, and his legends indicate strong dramatic instincts. Among advanced tribes, according to Dr. Franz Boas: \"...an elaborate series of esoteric doctrines and practices exists, which are known to only a small portion of the tribe, while the mass of the people are familiar only with part of the ritual and with its exoteric features. For this reason we often find the religious beliefs and practices of the mass of a tribe rather heterogeneous as compared with the beliefs held by the priests. Among many of the tribes in which priests are found, we find distinct esoteric societies, and it is not by any means rare that the doctrines of one society are not in accord with those of another...Esoteric forms of religion in charge of priests are found among the tribes of the arid region of the Southwest, the tribes of the southern Mississippi basin, and to a less extent among the more northerly tribes on the Plains. It would seem that, on the whole, the import of the esoteric teachings decreases among the more northerly and northeasterly tribes of the continent.\" The medicine priests were trained by their predecessors or were called to their life work by some miraculous incident. The little Indian boy who early in life showed a tendency to dreams and visions was encouraged to select this career. In a highly organized tribal system, he was initiated into the religious institutions of his nation, receiving the lore of the old priests and fragments of tribal history. If he belonged to some small, wandering band, his entire spiritual education had come from within and was induced by fasting and vigil. The vigil was the most widely practiced religious discipline of the Amerinds. In all matters of emergency or great decision the Indian sought solitude. He went alone to some high place, built a small campfire, planted about him a circle of prayer plumes, smoked the ceremonial pipe, and waited through the long hours of the night for the \"voices.\" The \"voices\" instructed him in the herbs of healing, taught him the songs and dances, and brought him news of what was transpiring in distant places. There are many stories about medicine priests learning to leave their bodies at will and journeying into the shadowland to guide the dying to the home of ghosts. Many of these grand old mystics were wise in the ways of the spirit, and should be regarded as duly initiated members of Esoteric Orders. The miraculous powers of the medicine priests extended over a wide variety of phenomena. They healed the sick, protected their tribes, [they] directed the migrations of their peoples, and sought by extrasensory means the location of food, water, and other necessities. They predicted the future, [they] induced rain and storms, projected themselves to distant places, and read the hearts and minds of their fellow men. It was in their power to induce visions and trances, and to receive the impressions of the star ‐ spirits. They also gained 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"considerable proficiency in the mesmeric and hypnotic arts. [One] Charles F. Lummis, who spent many years among the Southwest Indians of the United States, described the miracles performed by the medicine priests. Although naturally skeptical, his experiences among the Navajo and Pueblo Indians impressed him deeply. Mr. Lummis mentioned how Indians seated in their medicine lodge created miniature thunderstorms within the room, accompanied by flashes of forked lightning, while the outside sky was entirely clear. He says: \"How the effects are produced I am utterly unable to explain, but they are startlingly real.\" He was also impressed by the ability of the priests to change themselves into animals in the presence of spectators. Some priests could create an artificial sun inside the lodge. This miniature luminary rose in the eastern side of the room, crossed overhead, and set in the west during the performance of the sacred chants. [Now,] Amerindian priests grow the sacred corn in exactly the same way that the East Indian mendicant grows his mango tree. The magician plants the seed which grows immediately, and about three hours later the stalk is laden with fully developed ears of corn. Other writers have reported that in some of the medicine lodges the Indians are able to levitate large stones and to cause their own bodies to float in the air. Unprejudiced observers have been forced to conclude that among most tribes of Amerinds magical rituals are performed involving the use of natural forces beyond the normal experience of human beings. The Amerindic concept of cosmogony paralleled, in a general way, that of the Chaldeans and other peoples who dwelt in the valley of the Euphrates. The world consisted of three regions, with human beings inhabiting the surface of the central zone. Above this middle land was an airy expanse extending to the abode of the Sky ‐ Father. Below the surface were subterranean levels extending downward to the place of the earth ‐ mother. This cavernous region was like the dark and shadowy underworld of the pre ‐ Homeric Greeks. In the Southwest legends, human beings originated beneath the earth in a kind of paradisaical land. There, also, were mountains, valleys, and beautiful plains, and a sun and moon that lighted the region. In the beginning everyone was happy, but later an evil deed brought upon them the wrath of the gods. In most accounts this lovely shadowland was destroyed by a flood. In some miraculous manner a few righteous persons were preserved and took refuge on a tall plant, which, growing rapidly, finally broke through the surface of the middle land, bringing the survivors to safety. The secrets of healing, prophecy, and magic came to the Indian from an order of beings called manitos . This Algonquian word is now applied to the concept of powerful governing spirits. The manitos were not actually gods, but superhuman manlike creatures, possessing extraordinary attributes and frequently considered as giants. The size factor, however, is figurative rather than literal. The manitos were a divine invisible tribe ‐‐ masters of magic ‐‐ to whom human beings could turn for help and guidance whenever necessity arose. The effort to explain the term manitos as only signifying a \"wonderful power\" and synonymous with the Iroquois orenda is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the Indian religious philosophy. Orenda conveys more precisely a power or energy universally present in animate and inanimate creatures, and manifesting through the vital processes which cause things to exist, to function, and to affect other existing and functioning things. It might be safer[, folks,] to assume that the manitos represented the intelligence controlling and directing the \"wonderful power.\" The Indian, therefore, was confronted with the same basic question which disturbs even the most advanced physicist, namely: Is there a supreme intelligence governing universal procedure? \"The religious concepts of the Indians,\" writes Dr. Boas, \"may be described in two groups ‐‐ those that concern the individual, and those that concern the social group, such as tribe and clan. The fundamental concept bearing on the religious life of the individual is the belief in the existence of magic power, which may influence the life of man, and which in turn may be influenced by human activity. In this sense magic power must be understood as the wonderful qualities which are believed to exist in objects, animals, men, spirits, or deities, and which are superior to the natural qualities of man.\" Most religions and metaphysical philosophies include hierarchies of divine creatures, or tutelary spirits, as mediators between the Supreme Being and mortals. The manitos acted as wise distributors of the orenda . The Indian fashioned these demigods in his own likeness, but bestowed upon them superior powers. The manitos were aware of the most secret human thoughts and the most pressing human needs, and were capable of responding immediately to the rituals of the priests and elders. When the medicine man journeyed to the spirit land, he might be invited to attend a council of manitos . When he came to the Great Lodge in the sky, it resembled an earthly council place, except that it was larger, more elegant, and usually filled with a strange light. The manitos were venerable sachems, usually handsome old men, their faces full of kindness. There was a council fire, the smoking of the calumet, and the usual speeches and discussions. The Lodge was a kind of superphysical senate where all matters of grave import were decided. When the session was concluded, the priest returned to his people along the \"sky road\" and reported the decisions of the Great Lodge. Between the manitos and mankind were the souls of the illustrious dead. These were the Olds and the Trues, the sages of long ago, the great chieftains, warriors, and statesmen. They had led their people in life, so they continued to guard them from the other land, speaking through the medicine men. It seemed natural to the Amerinds that the heroes who had gone before should continue to serve 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"the tribes they had guided in the long ago. Totemism was a kind of heraldry among the Indians. The totem was the clan symbol; but [even] more than that, it was a channel for the distribution of orenda through the social and political structure of the clan. The totemic animal or bird was a spirit guardian, helpful because the creature possessed attributes superior in some particular to those of man. The attribute might be swiftness, strength, cunningness, or resourcefulness, and these qualities the totem creature shared with those under its guardianship. Each Indian also had his own totem, and while it took a familiar form it was identical in principle with the guardian daemon described in works on the Egyptian and Chaldean Mysteries. It was considered a good omen to see one's totem while practicing vigil, or in dreams or trances. It proved the proximity of a protecting power. The Abbé Phavenet, a missionary to the Algonquians, identifies the totem (from ote , the ototeman of the Chippewas) with the manito concept in these words: \"It is to be presumed that in uniting into a tribe, each clan preserves its manitou , the animal which in the country whence the clan came was the most beautiful or the most friendly to man, or the most feared, or the most common; the animal which was ordinarily hunted there and which was the ordinary subsistence of the clan, etc.; and this animal became the symbol of each family and that each family transmitted it to its posterity to be the perpetual symbol of each tribe [[or] clan].\" Modern ethnologists have emphasized that the popular usage of the term totem is incorrect. The symbol is not strictly religious, but involves a social and family concept with emphasis upon the importance of kinship. ======================================== (end of quote) (William Coopers offers an information packet) Good night, and God bless you all.

This is the only hour that ever was, or ever will be. This is the most important hour in your entire life, for, during this hour, you will decide your future and, thus, our collective futures. I'm William Cooper, and this is the Hour of the Time. (opening music: unknown orchestral waltz) Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we continue with America's Assignment with Destiny . You remember, we talked about the history of the religion in the Mystery School of the ancient Aztecs, the Mayans and the other American Indians of the old Americas, before Europeans supposedly set foot upon the shores. As you will hear, it's entirely possible and, indeed, highly probable that, not only Europeans, but people from the Middle East and from the continent of Africa, set foot upon these shores long, long before Columbus ever dreamed... ever dreamed of reaching India by sailing toward the west. In fact, if you've been listening closely to the previous episodes of America's Assignment with Destiny , you may have already understood that the Indians were practicing almost exactly the same Mystery Religion that was present in the Middle East and in Egypt long, long before the birth of Christ. [reading from America's Assignment with Destiny , written by Manly P. Hall]: (start of quote) ===================================================== Many tribes, especially the Plains Indians, believed that thunder and lightning were caused by enormous birds ‐‐ the rumbling sounds in the sky accompanying storms were due to the flapping of their wings, and the flashes of light were caused by the opening and closing of their eyes. In some groups, only one thunderbird was recognized; in other tribes, there were several of various colors or a family of them. The appearance of the bird, or birds, is not definitely given; it might be similar to a large hawk, an eagle, or even a grouse. The thunderbird could use its wings as a bow to shoot arrows, and small meteors were believed to be the heads of these arrows. On the Plains, thunderstorms were said to result from a contest between a thunderbird and a huge rattlesnake, or dragonlike monster. Persons struck by lightning, if they recovered, were accepted as sages or holy men, having received a very strong medicine from [this] experience. In some areas the thunderbird was closely associated with the religious Mysteries or Societies. Those who saw this creature in their vigils usually considered themselves as intended for a religious life. The myths and legends of the thunderbird are similar to the European and Asiatic accounts of the fabled phoenix, which [you're hearing an awful lot about it, even today. The phoenix] nested in flames and symbolized initiation and adeptship. [And today, it symbolizes the New World Order, rising from the ashes of the Old ‐‐ death and rebirth, resurrection, reincarnation. All of these are the symbols, or symbolized by the phoenix.] Early drawings of the Great Seal of the United States indicate that the bird represented thereon was a phoenix rather than an eagle [that you see today]. Like the Mexican coat of arms, which shows an eagle with a serpent in its claws, the American device is strongly reminiscent of a thunderbird. These creatures were also said to inhabit a sky ‐ world above the clouds, and served as messengers between mortals and the heavenly beings. Farther south the thunderbird symbol merged with the quetzal and the serpent feathered with quetzal plumes. The quetzal was identical in meaning with the phoenix of Asia, North Africa, and the Near East. The feathered ‐ serpent symbolism can be traced back to the hooded Nagas, or serpent gods of India, and to the winged serpents which occur in the writings and sculpturings of the [ancient] Egyptians. 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The serpent was the messenger and servant of the earth ‐ mother because it dwelt below ground. For this reason rattlesnakes were released during the snake dances, in order that they might carry the petitions of the tribe to the mother who dwelt below. Birds were also carriers of tidings, and as they flew upward they bore with them prayers to the Great Father who lived in the Sky ‐ Lodge. The thunderbird was the most powerful and was the lord of flying things. and the feathered snake was symbolic of the mysteries of the upper and lower regions. Priestly Orders served this twofold cult, the secrets of which were revealed only by an internal mystical experience. [William Cooper: Now, remember, the ancient Egyptian religion? They had the mysteries of the upper and lower regions, and the \"Priestly Orders served this twofold cult,\" also, the androgynous god.] ...Brinton, describing various devices used by the Amerindian tribes to conserve their religious secrets, says: \"All these stratagems were intended to shroud with impenetrable secrecy the mysteries of the brotherhood. With the same motive, the priests formed societies of different grades of illumination, only to be entered by those willing to undergo trying ordeals whose secrets were not to be revealed under the severest penalties.\" [William Cooper: Now, anyone who's listened to our 26 episodes of the series on Mystery Babylon, the Mystery Schools, will recognize the exact same religious philosophy that permeated first, the old Mediterranean world and northern Africa, and then through the episodes of the Crusades and the Templars was brought into Europe, and persist to this day, all over the world.] \"The Algonkins had three such grades...[Remember, the three degrees of initiation? Three degrees in six acts, or eighteen...6 ‐ 6 ‐ 6? The three grades of the Algonkins were] the waubeno , the meda , and the jossakeed , the last[, of course] being the highest. To this no white man was ever admitted. All tribes appear to have been controlled by these secret societies.\" [William Cooper: Just as our modern society is controlled by the Mysteries today.] Among the Amerindians, Secret Societies existed for the perpetuation and enlargement of the choicest knowledge of the tribe. [William Cooper: Remember, the heart and soul of the Mysteries is illumination, the light, Lucifer. Lucifer, of course, is represented by the sun, which is the wisdom of the world. (laughs) It represents the intellect. Remember, the Garden of Eden, the story that Lucifer, through his agent, Satan, enticed Eve, and thus, man, to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and told them that they would not surely die, and that they would be as gods? Well, this is the promise. And with that gift of intellect that man received from Satan, indirectly from Lucifer, man himself will become god. This is the heart and soul of the Mystery Schools.] There were war associations, healing cults, and Fraternities concerned with the religious Mysteries, the keeping of records, and the dramatization of myths. There were ethical societies, orders of mirth ‐ makers, fire ‐ walkers, and hunters, presided over by elders who had distinguishing regalia. Women frequently became leaders of these groups. Among the Pueblo Indians there were often a dozen or more Societies in one village. While their objectives were not always parallel, there was no friction [among] the memberships and they united in all common responsibilities The Indian was always a tolerant man on the subject of spiritual convictions. He never inquired as to the faith of his guest, but expected that every true believer would conduct himself in an honorable way. He respected the rites of strangers, and if he did not share in them or did not understand their meanings, he kept a respectful silence. The reference to the dramatization of myths suggests that a member of Indian tribes were practicing the same methods of presenting religious Mysteries that were employed by the Greeks and [the] Egyptians. Most Indian festivals emphasized songs and dances, but the songs were used principally to establish rhythms and the words were of slight importance. Chants were a vital element in most healing ceremonies. Either the Western Hemisphere received a vital religious stimulus from early voyagers and travelers from distance parts or else the Indian himself by mystical experiences shared a common inspiration with the priestly castes of other nations. The psychologists would probably assume that the esoteric tradition originated in the spiritual needs of the human being, regardless of his race or place of habitation. [William Cooper: But that does not fit any test of common sense. In fact, it's ludicrous.] The search for reality gradually brought into being specialized groups of intensive truth seekers. [And] these groups produced their own leaders, and such wise men and women were acknowledged as divinely inspired, received spontaneous admiration and devotion, were obeyed for their superior endowments, and gradually became a priestly caste. [Now,] civilization enlarged the temporal state of the tribe, the religious Societies grew to become powerful institutions, as in Central America. While the tribes remained nomadic, the medicine men were less resplendent and impressive, but their functions were no less significant. 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"These holy persons seldom took part in war, and frequently were distinguished by a costume combining elements of male and female attire. [William Cooper: And, remember, the god is an androgynous god: bi ‐ polar, male/female, positive/negative, bad/good, divine and evil, all within the same. [sic] And this is the truth; this is the reality in all of the Mysteries.] This practice [of wearing male and female attire] has been common throughout the religious world and has influenced the dress of pagan priests and Christian clergy alike. [For example, the Catholic priest...the Catholic bishop.] The androgynous human being, in whom there is a spiritual union of male and female attributes, has been widely accepted as personifying a superior type capable of a greater understanding of the Father ‐ wisdom and Mother ‐ love potencies of Divinity. Such symbolism [ladies and gentlemen] existed in all [of] the great Esoteric Orders of the past. While ethnologists may be reluctant to admit that the Indians had any formal concept of an esoteric religion, examination into the secret beliefs of the priests of the various tribes shows that they were verging toward the adept tradition, even if it had not matured among them. The Midewiwin, or Great Medicine Society of the Ojibways, initiated both men and women into the secrets of the art of healing and the control of the vital current coursing through the nerve centers of the human body. The Society of the Mides, or shamans, had birchbark rolls which depicted the arrangements of the lodges and included many strange pictographs. Of these, W.J. Hoffman writes: \"To persons acquainted with secret societies, a good comparison for the Midewiwin charts would be what is called a trestle board of a Masonic order, which is printed and published and publicly exposed without exhibiting any secrets of the order; yet it is not only significant, but useful to the esoteric in assistance to their memory as to the details of the ceremony.\" The secrets of the Midewiwin were originally communicated to mankind by an initiate ‐ priest, Manabozho, or Great Rabbit, who was a servant of the Good Spirit. The cross was an important symbol in the Midewiwin Rites, and it is interesting that the Mides steadfastly refused to give up their religion and be converted to Christianity. The controversy as to the possible Masonic significance of the Midewiwin Rites may be noted, but has slight bearing upon the essential facts. Although the birchbark rolls have bestowed prominence upon the activities of this Society, other tribes practiced equally significant rituals and ceremonies. Candidates advanced through four degrees, traveling toward the east, [and where have you heard that before, steady listeners?] and the lodge rooms were enclosures open to the sky and connecting with each other through doors and passageways [so that they could look upon the celestial sphere]. The neophyte was tested and subjected to trials and hazards and also was presented with a sequence of visual arrangements of symbols and other esoteric paraphernalia. The purpose of the Great Medicine Society was to enlighten the human mind and soul and to bind the initiates to the service of their people. It included a method for stimulating extrasensory perceptions and personal investigation into the secrets of Nature. In 1919, Arthur C. Parker was invited into a secret lodge of the Senecas to witness their ceremonies. Here he heard the legend of Red Hand, a culture hero, who could hold conversation with the Great Mystery. From the Great Mystery he learned to love all the creatures of the earth, and he spoke the language of the birds and animals. Red Hand was slain by a poisoned arrow because he would not reveal to his assassin the secret of his spiritual power. The animals, discovering by the power of scent that their brother ‐ friend had been killed, gathered in council about his body to find a means of bringing him back to life. Each of the creatures gave part of himself to restore Red Hand to the living. At last the bear came forward, and grasping the hand of the martyred hero raised him by the strong grip of his paw. Those acquainted with the ritual of the Third Degree of the Blue Lodge of Freemasonry will realize that this story must have originated among the rituals of the esoteric schools. [William Cooper: Because it is the exact same ceremony of the raising of the Master Mason at the end of the initiation of the Third Degree by the grip of the Lion's paw.] Mr. Parker, himself a 32° [Freemason], sums up the account of his experience in the rites of the Senecas, [thusly]: \"Little has been told; the door has only been held ajar the slightest space and no[, no] secrets have been revealed. There were feather wands and deerskins, but no purple robes or crowns. Yet, who shall say that the Senecas have not the thread of the legend of Osiris or that they have not an inherent Freemasonry?\" [And, indeed, who can say?] In the area centering in what is now New York State and extending north and south a considerable distance, the five, later six, nations compromising the Iroquois League attained a high state of social and political integrity. The two great leaders of these Amerinds were Deganawida and Hiawatha. It is impossible to study the life of Deganawida, whose coming was announced by a mysterious visitor from the heaven ‐ world, without realizing that he fulfilled all the requirements of the adept tradition. Deganawida was born of an immaculate conception... [William Cooper: Let me say that again for you, folks:] 216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Deganawida was born of an immaculate conception, possessed the power to work miracles, prayed and fasted, practiced the vigils, was confirmed in his mission by the Great Father, and passed through numerous trials and persecutions. Hiawatha became his first and most distinguished disciple, and these two working together sought to establish everlasting peace among their peoples. The founder of the Inca dynasty of Peru was the initiate ‐ statesman, Manco Capac, who flourished in the eleventh century A.D. He reformed the social and religious life of the tribes of the Aymara Quichua race. In the capital city of Cuzco which he built, Manco Capac established the religion of the sun. He was a statesman of ability, and claimed to be a direct descendant of the sun god. The empire of the Incas which he founded is remembered especially for its experiments in socialized living. Peru has the distinction of having cradled the first successful Utopia. [William Cooper: And, folks, I would argue with that. If it was so successful, where is it today? Manly P. Hall probably would disagree with that, saying that for its time it was a successful Utopia. Utopia means \"perfect,\" folks, it means the best. It means the fulfillment of all (laughs) the ideals, and could never pass away, if it was, in fact, a successful Utopia. And that's the problem with these priests of the Mystery Religion and their dream of a world Utopia made up of imperfect men, ruled by imperfect men, who have other agendas; who have selfishness; who covet; who steal and lie. We all struggle with those things every day, and anyone who stands before me and tells me that they do not struggle with these imperfections of man and with the temptations of the material world and of the flesh, then I see before me a liar.] Manco Capac emerges as one of the world's outstanding social reformers, with a vision thousands of years ahead of his time. He is said to have brought with him to Peru a divine bird in a sacred wicker hamper. This golden falcon is a form of the phoenix, and testifies to the presence of the adept doctrine. Manco Capac combines in his own person the offices of priest and king, like the Melchizedeks of Christian mysticism. [William Cooper: Christian mysticism? Oh, yes, ladies and gentlemen. You didn't know this, but Christianity started out as a secret society and later, later was even named the \"Friendly Open Secret Society\". Wasn't open at all. [sic] And it had degrees of initiation, which exist in the priesthood, even today.] Although some historians may be a trifle impulsive when they suggest that Manco Capac was a Buddhist priest, there can be no doubt that the Peruvian culture was heavily influenced by symbols, rituals, and philosophical elements usually associated with the trans ‐ Himalayan area of Central Asia. [William Cooper: Now, if Manco Capac was not a Buddhist priest from the Far East, how did he bring these teachings to the Indian people, who had never seen or heard of him before, and knew not from whence he came?] In Deganawida, with his Great League, Quetzalcoatl ‐ Kulkulcan and his splendid socialized empires in Mexico and Central America, and Manco Capac and the communal system which he set up in Peru, we have three clear and definite accounts of initiates ‐ leaders establishing schools of esoteric doctrines in the Western Hemisphere. From a consideration of their attainments and the systems which they inaugurated, we can come to but one conclusion[, ladies and gentlemen]: The Mystery Schools of antiquity were represented in the Americas by institutions identical in principle and in purpose with those of Asia and the Mediterranean countries. ======================================== (end of quote) How could this be? How, indeed. Is it true that at one time, according to the theory of plate tectonics, that all of the continents were together in one? And that there was free interchange and activity conducted between all of the peoples of the earth? Were they, indeed, at one time ruled by one great ruler in one great city? And was there at one time, one great continent in the whole world known as Atlantis? And was the scattering of the peoples and the mixing of the languages ‐‐ and the tangling of the tongues described in the Bible ‐‐ was this merely the breakup of that one continent as the plate tectonics began to move away from each other? As the Earth's crust shrank and molten magma compressed below began to push up and separate...separate the piece of land from each other? Was this is the scattering of the peoples? Was this the destruction of the Tower of Babel? Was this...was this the real truth of what happened in history? It doesn't say that here. This is what has come to mind in my own research, and may account for many of the legends of all the peoples of the earth. We have much more studying to do; much more putting together of the pieces of the puzzle. But, folks, of all the studies that have ever been made, we believe that our conclusions are probably closer to the truth than anyone else has ever, ever come. In any case, we hope we are, and if we're not, we certainly will pick up the thread the truth, wherever it leads us. And if we turn out to be wrong, you will be the first to hear it. 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"But it appears to us that at one time...at one time, all of the peoples of the world had a common source of religion and knowledge, and that, somehow, these people were scattered over the earth, and lost their contact with each other, and lost their contact with the source of their religion and their knowledge. And even though some...some of the portions of their society and some of their religions may differ slightly, at the heart and core of all of them, they are the same. And that is what is important: that you understand that, somehow, the great Mystery Religions and the great societies that existed in ancient Egypt, and Mesopotamia, and Greece and eventually in Europe were nothing new to the peoples who lived in South America, and North America, and on the Asian continent. And the Mysteries were even known to the Aboriginals in the continent of Australia, in the islands of New Guinea, in the rainforests of the Amazon jungle. So you see, folks, what we are talking about here is not the story...not the story of one sacrificed king; but the story existed amongst all peoples, in all areas, of all the islands, and continents, and lands of the world, to all peoples, there appeared a man who taught the same teachings, who experienced the same persecutions, and ultimately the same death. The sacrificed king that we, in the western world, have always known as Jesus Christ. Was it the same man who appeared to all peoples? Or were they different men, sent by God, who appeared to all peoples? Or were they merely men who pulled off, in their different cultures and societies, the greatest hoax in the world? I don't know the answer to these questions at all. What I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe through faith alone. For, indeed, no one has ever been even able to even prove that the man really lived and walked upon the face of this earth in the Middle East ‐‐ and I am speaking of the man we know as Jesus Christ ‐‐ and not all of the other people who appeared to various cultures and various societies in the world who fulfilled the same role to those people. And maybe...maybe that's why it was so difficult to convert some peoples to Christianity. Maybe they already were, in their own way, Christians. It's time for our break, folks. Don't go away. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: none) Folks, I hope you're enjoying tonight's program. This will the 27th broadcast in the series on the Mystery Religions, the Mystery Schools, the Ancient Mystery Religions of Babylon. Now, I don't know if you've made the connection yet ‐‐ and if you've just started listening to this program, then I would not even expect you to understand what all this means. But for those of you who've been with us for a long, long time, and have listened to that series on the Mystery Religions from the beginning, I certainly expect you to understand the connect between what you are hearing and what is happening in the world today. And if you understand that connection, then you understand this signifies tremendous change, which is going to appear and confront us in the immediate future, then you understand that you must take steps now to protect what you have... (William Cooper does commercial for Swiss America Trading Corporation) (break music: unknown orchestral music) [reading from America's Assignment with Destiny , written by Manly P. Hall]: (start of quote) ===================================================== Prevailing historical accounts which deal with the discovery and colonization of the Western Hemisphere must someday be completely revised. Modern scholars have accepted, without proper reflection, a fabrication of lies fashioned to deceive and to prevent the recognition of facts [which are] detrimental, even dangerous, to the ulterior motives of [very, very] powerful interests. Time[, ladies and gentlemen,] will reveal that the continent now known as America was actually discovered and, to a considerable degree, explored more than a thousand years before the beginning of the Christian Era. The true story was in the keeping of the Mystery Schools, and passed from them to the Secret Societies of the medieval world. The Esoteric Orders of Europe, Asia, and the Near East were in at least irregular communication with the priesthoods of the more advanced Amerindian nations. Plans for the development of the Western Hemisphere were formulated in Alexandria, Mecca, Delhi, and Lhasa long before most European statesmen were aware of the great Utopian program. 218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: For reference to that, see The Mystery of Columbus , by Jennings C. Wise.] The explorers who open the New World operated from a master plan [the same plan that is in operation today] and [they] were agents of rediscovery rather than discoverers. Very little is \"known\"[, folks,] about the origin, lives, characters, and policies of these intrepid adventurers. Although they lived in a century amply provided with historians and biographers, these saw fit either to remain silent or to invent plausible accounts without substance. Does it not seem remarkable that no one is certain whether Christopher Columbus was actually an English prince, a Greek nobleman, or a Genoses sea captain? Was he granted arms without any examination into his ancestry[, something that was unheard of in that day]? Why is it so difficult to ascertain the real name of the man known as Amerigo Vespucci? Who was John Cabot, whose life and exploits are but fragments rather than the sober records of a distinguished citizen? If these men were what they seemed to be, there could have been no advantage gained by such elaborate concealment. If there [was] a mystery, that which was hidden must have been regarded as valuable. Plato described the vast continent of Atlantis, which sank beneath the oceans as the result of a seismic cataclysm. [Now, ]there are several possible interpretations of Plato's account. The lost Atlantis could represent a submerged body of knowledge drowned in a sea of forgetfulness. This would explain and justify Bacon's restoration of the fable, which was nothing more than bringing into the light matters long hidden. According to the Critias , the oceans became so agitated and laden with mud and slime that navigation to the west ceased. Sailors feared to go beyond the Pillars of Hercules toward those Hesperic Isles sacred to the Mysteries. Even had Christian nations dared to violate the edicts of the Secret Schools, such audacity would have been held in check by the power of Islam, seated in the Holy House at Cairo, and the edicts of Lhasa, backed by the armed strength of the Mongol Empire. The East agreed to preserve the boundaries of Europe, if the European states would bind themselves in a solemn alliance to refrain from exploiting the resources of the Western Hemisphere. [William Cooper: Now why would they insist upon that agreement, when no one knew anything about the Western Hemisphere? At least, to the public, [aye]?] Fear of a terrible retribution from beyond the walls of Gog and Magog prevented the Popes from violating their agreement. And without the leadership of the Church, the great families dared not engage in private projects. When the appointed hour came, the Secret Societies selected their own agents to initiate the program of exploration. [William Cooper: And thus began America's secret assignment with destiny.] \"Was Columbus then working,\" asks Grace A. Fendler, \"either as an individual or as a chosen representative of Secret Societies, to bring into expression the old Utopian ideals and to directionalize them across the Seas? Certainly this would go far to explain the charges of 'traitor'; the seizure of all his books and papers; the destruction of all portraiture and likenesses even to the usual mortuary 'busts and arms'; and the complete disappearance of many of his literary works, including the Journal of the First Voyage and the Book of the Second Voyage . All this[, ladies and gentlemen,] would then have been mere inquisitional routine, with the rewriting of his biography more or less both of political necessity and[, of course,] a Holy Duty.\" [William Cooper: See the book for more on this: New Truths About Columbus .] Campanella, in his Civitas Solis , causes a Genoese sea captain to be the guest of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitalers. When Columbus, on the occasion of his first landfall, raised the standard of Castile, he also planted a banner of his own, consisting of a green cross on a white field. Was this a device of the Knights [Templars]? [William Cooper: You bet your booties it was.] The formal education of the man who called himself Christopher Columbus has been the subject of much speculation. The navigator wrote, in 1501, that during his many voyages to all parts of the world he had met learned men of various races and sects and had \"endeavored to see all books of cosmography, history, and philosophy and of other sciences.\" [Now,] if the admiral had seriously endeavored to examine early works on navigation, he undoubtedly had noted the references, brief but significant, by Homer, Solon, Aristotle, Pliny, and other ancient authors to \"distant lands beyond the great oceans.\" Plutarch's voyagers must have explored vast areas, and Verplanck Colvin summarizes the old accounts thus: \"In the days of Homer, or rather before his time, navigators traveled thousands of miles out into the Atlantic, and back across it...they were guided in their voyages by the stars.\" [William Cooper: For reference to that, see Geographical and Mathematical Discussions of Plutarch's Accounts of Ancient Voyages to the New World . Remember, folks, remember my admonition. Don't believe everything you hear on this program unless you go research it for yourself, and verify that it is, indeed, true. This is one of the greatest secrets that have been held by the Mysteries for thousands of 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"years. This needs to be brought to light, for I believe wholeheartedly that this is the truth of the matter. In my research, as has indicated to me, that is it nothing but the truth.] One group of \"authorities\" considers it probable that Columbus was little better than an illiterate sailor, and that his rudiments of learning were derived from a guild school supposed to have been established by the weavers of the city of Genoa. The opposing faction of historians insists that Columbus possessed considerable scholarship even before his celebrated journey. According to Henry Harisse, an outstanding writer on the Columbus mystery, the navigator left ninety ‐ seven manuscripts and over twenty ‐ five thousand marginalia, which may be considered a remarkable achievement for an illiterate. [William Cooper: How many illiterates do you know who have ever written anything , much less ninety ‐ seven manuscripts and over twenty ‐ five thousand marginalia.] The truth is that the admiral cannot be explained without reference to the Secret Societies, which were the peculiar custodians of the exact information which he required. [William Cooper: They were, they were, and are, and always will be, unless the sheeple of the world wake up to the fact, the Guardians of the Secrets of the Ages.] The religious and mystical inclinations of the great discoverer are mentioned by most of his biographers. At times Columbus dressed in a plain robe and girdle similar to the costume of the Franciscan Order. It was reported by his son that Columbus died wearing a Franciscan frock. It is not known however, that he was directly associated with this Order, even as a lay Brother. Several religious groups of the times, including Fraternities known to be connected with the esoteric tradition, favored this kind of habit. Perhaps the peculiarities of his costume were overlooked or conveniently forgotten. The admiral regarded himself as chosen by heaven to fulfill a great mission, and was strengthened by the conviction that he was guarded and guided by the divine providence. [William Cooper: Where have you heard that before? Divine providence was spoken of by Columbus and by all of our forefathers, whom also, by the way, belonged to the same Mystery Religion.] Such contemporary reports[, folks,] could imply far more than modern writers would like to acknowledge [William Cooper: And far more than you probably even want to hear.] In [these] troublous times, it was customary for the members of Secret Societies to conceal the true source of their instructions by some general statement about heavenly guidance. The mystical instincts of the admiral, his belief in miracles, prophecies, and the doctrine of preordination have been advanced by some critics as proofs of his mental instability [a la David Koresh]. Referring to what he calls the \"colossal, mystical self ‐ confidence\" of Columbus. John Bartlet Brebner writes that it was so integral a part of the navigator that \"he could believe on one occasion in his voyaging that God had led him to the New Heaven and New Earth of Revelation, and in his darkest hour he knew that God spoke to him in encouragement.\" On his Third Voyage, the navigator believed that he heard the voice of God speaking words of strength and comfort. On his Fourth Voyage, when great emergencies threatened the entire enterprise, the admiral fell into a trance and a voice spoke to him [and said]: \"O fool, and slow to believe and to serve thy God, the God of all! What did He do more for Moses, or for David His servant, than He has done for thee?\" [William Cooper: For reference to that, see the book called The Explorers of North America .] Columbus[, folks,] may have been a disciple or student of the illuminated Raymond Lully. There is a persistent rumor to this effect. He was also involved with the group perpetuating the political convictions of Dante. The following tribute to the Italian poet is indicative and stimulating: \"Dante himself was a member of the Albigensian church, and, it is said, for a number a years officiated as pastor of that powerful organization in various European cities. He was a friend of Roger Bacon, and an associate and advisor of powerful leaders in the ancient Order of the Temple, which was at the date of his death, while apparently at the summit of its power, actually nearing its disastrous end. Dante is said to have been an initiate of the esoteric doctrines of the Templars.\" Columbus made use of ciphers and cryptic allegorical expressions and figures of speech. While such ciphers are known to exist in his manuscripts, no systematic effort to decode them has come to public attention. Cecil Jane conjectured that Columbus in his cryptic signatures made use of something resembling a Baconian cipher intended to convey information which could not be directly communicated and to supply the clue to a secret otherwise carefully concealed. [William Cooper: See the book, entitled Contemporary Historical Review, Vol. 1:37. 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Incidentally[, folks,] the Columbus signature ‐ ciphers are extremely reminiscent of the Albigensian papermakers' marks [which you can look up]. Seraphim G. Canoutas, J.D., of the University of Athens, in his work Christopher Columbus, a Greek Nobleman , attempted to restore the early life of the great discoverer. His findings, calculated to sustain the title of his book, are most illuminating. The secret preparations for the colonizing of the Fortunate Isles, or \"the Blessed Isles of the West,\" were in the keeping of the Albigenses, the Troubadours, and the chivalric Orders of Knighthood. [William Cooper: Which are in control today. You see, when you started listening to my series on the Mystery Religions of Babylon, I know that some of you thought that I was stark ‐ raving mad. But if you persisted and listened to each episode, you can see the connecting links throughout history and you can see that I am the only one (laughs) who is telling you the truth, the real truth about the hidden powers that control our destinies and, indeed, the destiny of America.] The final phase of the exploration project was left largely to the erudition of Lorenzo the Magnificent and the skill of Leonardo da Vinci. Lorenzo de' Medici was a distinguished Platonist, a patron of Secret Societies, the founder of an important philosophical school, and a subtle adversary of the Borgias. Leonardo was a faithful agent of the great Florentine prince, and one of those men possessed by the spirit of \"towardness.\" Although Lorenzo did not live to see the fulfillment of the Great Plan [William Cooper: quote, unquote], he spoke the magic word which opened for Columbus the most exclusive institutions in Europe and invested him with the temporal means for acquiring a measure of consideration from liberal princes and scholars. [You see,] it was the invisible hand of the Medici that balanced on end the celebrated egg. The conclusions of Columbus concerning the shape of the earth indicate that he was acquainted with the esoteric traditions of Asia and the Near East. He partly revealed the source of his own instructions when he declared the planet to be shaped like a pear, the upper end of which projected toward the sky, like the boss in the center of a shield. [William Cooper: And it was not until we put satellites in the sky that the modern man discovered that the earth is shaped like a pear. And this discovery, ladies and gentlemen, came only recently...only recently. So we know that Columbus did have some source of esoteric truths that was not known by the common man, and was way beyond the ability of those at that time to even perceive, or to know, unless they were the remnant of some great society that had gone before and was destroyed.] [William Cooper: Now, I'm not telling you that's the truth, for no one really knows, but that's what all the evidence seems to point to. And who are these people, the survivors? Well, I would not even want to venture a guess at this point, but I certainly want to continue my research, and I want you to continue yours, and together we will find out.] [Now, what he knew about the earth is at the] top of this protuberance [of the pear ‐ shaped earth] was the terrestrial paradise, where none could go except by the grace of God. The admiral noted that this shape coincided with the opinions of certain holy and wise theologians, but he failed to mention the sects of religions to which they belonged. The earth ‐ mountain was certainly the Meru of the Brahmans and the sacred hill of the Egyptians Mysteries, Mount Meru, like Chang Shambhala, Olympus, and the peak described in The Revelation are all veiled allusions to the Invisible Government of the earth. [William Cooper: In case you didn't hear that, I'm going to repeat it.] The earth ‐ mountain was certainly the Meru of the Brahmans and the sacred hill of the Egyptians Mysteries, Mount Meru, like Chang Shambhala, Olympus, and the peak described in The Revelation are all veiled allusions to the Invisible Government of the earth. Nor should it be assumed[, ladies and gentlemen,] that all historical uncertainties centered around Christopher Colon, the dove of Genoa. The case of John Cabot is equally curious. There may be more than passing interest in the [observation] of one research student: \"When Columbus, in the interim between voyages disappears from public view, John Cabot appears and permanently disappears when Columbus reappears.\" [William Cooper: See the book, entitled New Truths About Columbus , by Grace A. Fendler, for reference to that.] [You see, it's] easy to forget that John Cabot was really Giovanni Caboto, born in Genoa and a naturalized citizen of Venice. It was especially mentioned that in one of his journeys Cabot visited Mecca, and, like Columbus, was acquainted with the wise men of the Near East. It has even been suggested that he had contacted the religious and political convictions of the secret Christian sect of the Johannites, which played so large a part in the esoteric doctrines of the Templars. Cabot conveniently found the ear of the English king, and was immediately entrusted with a delicate diplomatic mission to Denmark to arbitrate disputes over the fisheries of Iceland. Grace Fendler also notes that the records of the English Privy Purse shows a pension paid to one Antonio Cabot for several years after John Cabot was historically dead. The pension passed through the hands of an English merchant named Rici D'Americke. The voyages of Cabot were important inasmuch as they resulted in a division which gave most of 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"North America to the English group which was free from the theological and mercenary pressures of the Spanish program. [You see,] the Great Plan reached the Western Hemisphere through a series of incidents. Many early explorers and colonizers are known to have been associated with Secret Societies. There is no historical way of determining the secret spiritual convictions of so ‐ called conquistadors, adventurers, and founders of plantations. It is a well ‐ established fact[, folks,] that arts, sciences, philosophies, and political convictions accompany less valuable merchandise along trade routes and caravan trails. Some of the colonizers were probably unaware of the parts they were playing and the settlements which they founded remained for generations without the strength or security to advance ideological programs. The work, then as always, was in the hands and keeping of a [very] few initiated leaders. They were responsible for the results, and they built slowly and wisely, thinking not of their own days or of their own reputation, but of the future in which the Great Plan would be fulfilled. ======================================== (end of quote) You all...all of you out there listening all around the world have such unlimited potential, if only your own personal handsome prince or princess could deliver to your lips that magic kiss that would wake you from your profound sleep.

I'm your host, William Cooper. (opening music: The Triumphal March , written by Edvard Grieg) [announcement of radio station broadcast]: What you just heard, ladies and gentlemen, was The Triumphal March from Sigurd Jorsalfar [translation: Sigurd the Crusader], conducted by [Ed] Grieg. And I played it because I got some wonderful news. It is a triumph, in a way, at least I believe it is. I think you're all going to be happy, especially those of you who live in the state of Florida, because you're not going to have to pick through all the static on shortwave to hear the Hour of the Time anymore. In fact, we're going to be on a new radio station there, and it's sort of making history in a way, because it's the first radio station in the United States, and maybe even in the world, that's broadcast on the S ‐ A ‐ P, or SAP channel, the S ‐ A ‐ P channel. It's radio 27, WSAP, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. UHF TV 27, SAP, Separate Audio Program, the executive offices are Skinner Broadcasting Incorporated, 600 West Hillsboro Boulevard, Suite 27, Deerfield Beach, Florida, 33441 ‐ 1609. You can phone them, just in case you don't get this all written down in which you know, if you listen to this program, is a sin. You're not supposed to listen to this program without a pad of paper and a pen or pencil. You're supposed to write everything down. But here's the number: (305) 480 ‐ 2727. All of you folks in Florida, you're going to want to call that number and found out, make sure that you can get this program. (305) 480 ‐ 2727. We'll be broadcast in stereo, folks, in crystal clear stereo. You will love it, especially if you're used to hear it in shortwave radio through all the static and the [inaudible] and the jamming and the teletype stuff and everything else that they tell me is out there interfering. For release, August 16th, 1993, you're hearing this broadcast on Tuesday, our first broadcast on 27 was actually last night, folks, last night. Some of you may have had your TV accidentally set on the SAP channel and you may have heard it. If you did, that's fine. If you didn't, you can hear it from now on. I think it's too late when you hear this in Florida to get our broadcast tonight, but you'll be able to listen to it tomorrow night in primetime. You don't even have to stay up late anymore, folks. Isn't it wonderful? A new radio station, WSAP, signed on the air Monday, August 16th, 1993. The first of its kind in the nation. America's first radio station on television. \"What,\" you say, \"a radio station on television?\" That's right, folks, you heard it correctly. Home of the all ‐ American talk show team, 24 ‐ hours a day, WSAP broadcast with 70,000 watts on the SAP, or separate audio program, channel over UHF TV 27, Fort Lauderdale. Listeners may tune to the station in one of either two ways, so listen very carefully. Write this down. If you live in Florida, you may hear your cable system read to you right now. Here's how you can get the Hour of the Time on WSAP all over the state of Florida. Number one, by tuning in to channel six on the following cable systems: Continental Cable, Coral Springs Cable, Jones InterCable, TCI Cable of Hollywood, TCI Cable of North Dade, Gulf Pacific Cable of Weston, Bonn Adventure and Gold Coast Cable, Miami Beach. Did you hear that, folks? We're going to be at all the major hotels. After tuning to channel six on cable, then press the SAP button on your TV or remote control to hear radio WSAP, the Hour of the Time. Now, the second method by which you can receive WSAP is by connecting a UHF loop antenna, which you can go down and get at Radio Shack, any Radio Shack, just tell them you want a UHF loop antenna, or an outside UHF antenna to the UHF antenna terminals on your television set, tuned to channel TV, or UHF TV channel 27, then press the SAP button on your TV or remote control, and you will hear WSAP. Skinner Broadcasting Incorporated, owner of TV 27, CBS broadcasting channel 26, UCIX TV, over its main video and audio channel, and this will not change, folks. WSAP will air informative and entertaining talk show host from around the nation, 24 hours a day. Hosts include William Cooper, the Hour of the Time, 8pm Monday through Friday night and more than a dozen hard ‐ hitting programs dealing 223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"with subjects like what really happened in Waco, how the North American Free Trade Agreement will ruin America, and the truth about the Federal Reserve System. These broadcasts are not currently heard in south Florida, and according to Roger Skinner, station manager, we expect a lot of people will soon be talking about what they heard on WSAP. Boy, that's an understatement, the Hour of the Time is libel to get them thrown out of Florida! (laughs) But this is great, folks. All of you people living in Florida now, you don't have to stay up 'til midnight and tune in to staticky shortwave. If you have one of these cable services, or if you're in the Fort Lauderdale area, or near Fort Lauderdale where you can receive their 70,000 watt SAP transmission, you can just go down to Radio Shack and hook up a UHF loop antennae on the outside of your TV set and pick us up loud and clear. And folks, this is just the beginning, because I have something else to tell you. Beginning next week, we're going to be live on satellite and we'll be live on WWCR from that point on. Now, on WSAP in Florida, those will be taped shows. We will not be live, but we will be live on satellite and WWCR will be picking us up off satellite live and rebroadcasting Monday through Friday night at our regular time. So that also is great news. The satellite is SpaceNet ‐ 3, for those with a satellite dish, you can receive us in brilliant digital sound off of SpaceNet 3, channel 21, I believe it's 5.8 audio. But you can get that out of ...just look for Let's Talk Radio Network. That's Let's Talk Radio Network. It will be the same time you've been listening to us on WWCR shortwave, and we will still be on WWCR shortwave. The only difference is we'll be live; we'll be taped in Florida. So, even though you'll be listening to the program in Florida, a program that takes in live calls, in Florida, you will not be able to call because you will actually be listening to a taped program of a previous program, or whatever. So that's great news, folks. Remember, we're starting on WSAP last night [sic] in Florida, last night! We're already on the air there, and we're starting next week on satellite, Space Net 3, channel 21, and I believe it's 5.8 audio. If we're not on 5.8, just go up and down the audio scale until you find us or you can just look it up on SatMagazine. So that's all the great news, folks, and I hope you're just as happy as I am because I'm tickled pink. I'm so happy, I don't know what to do with myself, and it's going to keep me very busy. Of course, expenses are going way up. Our sponsors are picking up the cost of the satellite and the air time, but we're having to purchase an awful lot of expensive equipment so we'll be able to take your calls on the air, live. Now, we're not going to do it all the time, but we are going to do it, and we need your help, folks. We need donations to pay for all this equipment. We need a thousand dollars to pay for what's called a compressor. Now, I really don't know what that means but, in order to take phone calls, in order to send this broadcast live to the satellite uplink station, we need something that's called a compressor, and that costs a thousand dollars. It's nine hundred and something dollars is the actual price. So, we need donations, we need to purchase that piece of equipment. We need to purchase another...well, we need to purchase a whole bunch of stuff. Altogether, it's going to cost us right around five thousand...a little over five thousand dollars. We will appreciate your contributions. All your contributions will go to pay for equipment only. So please, folks, sit down and write out a check or send us a money order... (William Cooper continues request for contributions and talks about Backwoods Home Magazine ) OK, let me read this article to you. This article is...(laughs)...is really funny. It's called, \"No Ideology, No Agenda,\" and it's kind of a spoof. And Dave Duffy has written up here: \"We're delighted to give this issue's editorial space over to P.J. O'Rourke, who delivered these comments to a gathering of the Cato Institute, a free ‐ market think tank. O'Rourke has authored several books, including Parliament of Whores , a best ‐ seller about the United States government.\" Congress, in particular...and this article is reprinted with permission from the July 1993 American Spectator : The Cato Institute has an unusual political cause ‐‐ which is no political cause whatsoever. We are here tonight to dedicate ourselves to that cause, to dedicate ourselves, in other words, to...nothing. We have no ideology, no agenda, no catechism, no dialectic, no plan for humanity. We have no \"vision thing,\" as our ex ‐ president would say, or, as our current president would say, we have no Hillary. All we have is the belief that people should do what people want to do, unless it causes harm to other people. And that had better be clear and provable harm. No nonsense about second ‐ hand smoke or hurtful, insensitive language, please. I don't know what's good for you. You don't know what's good for me. We don't know what's good for mankind. And it sometimes seems as though we're the only people who don't. It may well be that, gathered right here in this room tonight,are all the people in the world who don't want to tell all the people in the world what to do. This is because we believe in freedom. Freedom ‐‐ what this country was established upon, what the Constitution was written to defend, what the Civil War was fought to perfect. Freedom is not empowerment. Empowerment is what the Serbs have in Bosnia. Anybody can grab a gun and be empowered. It's not entitlement. An entitlement is what people on welfare get, and how free are they? It's not an endlessly expanding list of rights ‐‐ the 224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"\"right\" to education, the \"right\" to health care, the \"right\" to food and housing. That's not freedom, that's dependency. [William Cooper: And most people never learn that!] Those aren't rights, those are the rations of slavery ‐‐ hay and a barn for human cattle. There is only one basic human right, the right to do as you damn well please. And with it comes the only basic human duty, the duty to take the consequences. So we are here tonight in a kind of anti ‐ matter protest ‐‐ an unpolitical undemonstration by deeply uncommitted inactivists. We are part of a huge invisible picket line that circles the White House twenty ‐ four hours a day. We are participants in an enormous non ‐ march on Washington ‐‐ millions and millions of Americans not descending upon the nation's capital in order to demand nothing from the United States government. To demand nothing, that is, except the one thing which no government in history has been able to do ‐‐ [and that is] leave us alone. There are just two rules of governance in a free society: [One,] Mind your own business. [And two,] Keep your hands to yourself. Bill [Clinton], keep your hands to yourself. Hillary, mind your own business. We have a group of incredibly silly people in the White House right now, people who think government works. Or that government would work, if you got some real bright young kids from Yale to run it. We're being governed by dorm room bull session. The Clinton administration is over there right now pulling an all ‐ nighter in the West Wing. They think that, if they can just stay up late enough, they can create a healthy economy and bring peace to former Yugoslavia. The Clinton administration is going to decrease government spending by increasing the amount of money we give to the government to spend. [Makes sense, doesn't it?] Health care is too expensive, so the Clinton administration is putting a high ‐ powered corporate lawyer in charge of making it cheaper. (This is what I always do when I want to spend less money ‐‐ hire a lawyer from Yale.) If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it's free. The Clinton administration is putting together a program so that college graduates can work to pay off their school tuition. As if this were some genius idea. It's called getting a job. Most folks do that when they get out of college, unless, of course, they happen to become governor of Arkansas. And the Clinton administration launched an attack on people in Texas because those people were religious nuts with guns. Hell, this country was founded by religious nuts with guns. Who does Bill Clinton think stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock? Peace Corps volunteers? Or maybe the people in Texas were attacked because of child abuse. But, if child abuse was the issue, why didn't Janet Reno tear ‐ gas Woody Allen? You know, if government were a product, selling it would be illegal. Government is a health hazard. Governments have killed many more people than cigarettes or unbuckled seat belts ever have. Government contains impure ingredients ‐‐ as anybody who's looked at Congress can tell you. On the basis of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign promises, I think we can say government practices deceptive advertising. And the merest glance at the federal budget is enough to convict the government of perjury, extortion, and fraud. There, ladies and gentlemen, you have the Cato Institute's program in a nutshell: government should be against the law. Term limits aren't enough. We need jail. Again, that was written by P.J. O'Rourke.

Well, folks, I'm going to take you one step further in your education tonight. I am holding in my hands, dear listeners, an old, very old book, published in 1883 in Philadelphia by Collins & McDill. The name of this book is In the Coils; or, The Coming Conflict . Again, the book was published in 1883 in Philadelphia by Collins & McDill. The title is In the Coils; or, The Coming Conflict , by E.B.G. This is the second edition, which means there was an edition before this. And there is a quote here by Wendell Philips, who says, \"This is the next great question the nation must take up and decide.\" And this book, ladies and gentlemen, is priceless, for it describes...it was originally copyrighted in 1882 ‐‐ actually, not copyrighted, but entered, according to an Act of Congress, in 1882 by A.P. McDill in the office of the librarian of Congress at Washington, D.C. So if you can't find this anywhere else, it is in the Library of Congress. This is about one man's battle with Freemasonry, and I'm going to read to you a letter, which begins on page 237. This letter is written by Dr. Groves and sent to a Mr. Dover: (start of quote) ========================================================================== BRANDON, May 18th, 18 ‐‐ . My Dear Friend: ‐‐ I have delayed a reply to your note in order that I might be able to answer both your questions fully and with some degree of certainty. I am glad to be able to say that I am personally acquainted with your nephew, and that I highly esteem him. I have consulted several influential men in our village, and we all agree in our opinion of Bates and his prospects in this precinct. So I can answer both of your questions together and use the plural \"we\" and \"our,\" instead of showing you mine opinion alone. We believe Bates to be the best candidate in the field as yet, and it is possible that he will have our hearty support. We are not altogether satisfied with any of our candidates; but we do not expect to find one that will suit us in every particular. We may consistently support a person and yet have some objection to him. So in regard to Bates. We have on serious objection to him, but whether that will be in our way of supporting him depends on circumstances. I suppose you want a plain statement of the whole matter 226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"rather than any uncertain and flattering promises, and I will not be kept back by fear of offending you, or by a desire for office or popularity, from stating clearly our objection to Bates, and the circumstances in which he may probably expect our support. We do not object to his abilities, moral character, republicanism, relatives or general fitness for the place. We appreciate him for all these. Our only objection to him is, that by certain and numerous oaths which he considers binding, (we do not, however,) he has pledged his support to a monopoly which is more powerful and dangerous than those which he professes to oppose, and has sworn his allegiance to a government which claims supremacy over all other authority whether of church or state. In a word, as we are informed, Mr. Bates is a Freemason. Now we know that everyone who enters the lodge swears \"to support the constitution of the Grand Lodge of the state, and to conform to the laws of any lodge of which he shall be a member, and also to obey all regular signs, summons or tokens from any Mason or body of Masons.\" Now whatever he may be told before taking this oath, after he does so he is taught that the authority of the lodge is absolute, the covenant is irrevocable, and its obligations are supreme. In General Ahiman Rezon; or, [The] Freemason's Guide we read: \"The candidate, entering the lodge, is on the point of binding himself voluntarily, absolutely and without reservation forever .\" Webb's Monitor says: \"The covenant is irrevocable. Even though a Mason may be suspended or expelled, though he may withdraw from the lodge, journey into countries where Masons cannot be found, or become a subject of despotic governments that persecute, or a communicant of bigoted churches that denounce Masonry, he cannot cast off or nullify his Masonic covenant. No law of the land can affect it; no anathema of the church can weaken it. It is irrevocable.\" Again, this same Masonic author says: \"The first duty of the reader of this synopsis is to obey the edicts of this Grand Lodge. Right or wrong, his very existence as a Mason hangs upon obedience to the power immediately set above him. Failure in this must infallibly bring down expulsion , which as a Masonic death, ends all. The one unpardonable crime in a Mason is contumacy , or disobedience.\" Although it takes much space in my letter, let me give you more testimony, with the names of the witnesses, who are all eminent members of the order and high in authority and some of whose works are in nearly every lodge, and necessarily have some effect on the members: \"That this surrender of free will to Masonic authority is absolute , (within the scope of the landmarks of the order), and perpetual , may be inferred from an examination of the emblem (the Shoe or Sandal) which is used to enforce this lesson of resignation.\" [That's from the] Morris Dictionary of Freemasonry . \"Disobedience is so subversive of the ground work of Masonry, in which obedience is so strongly inculcated, that the Mason who disobeys subjects himself to severe penalties.\" ‐‐ Ibid. \"A Grand Lodge is invested with power and authority over all the craft within its jurisdiction. It is the Supreme Court of Appeals in all Masonic cases, and to its decrees unlimited obedience must be paid by every lodge and every Mason situated within its control. The government of Grand Lodges is, therefore, completely despotic. While a Grand Lodge exists, its edicts must be respected and obeyed without examination by its subordinated lodges.\" [That's from] Mackey, Lexicon of Freemasonry, page 183 . \"For ourselves, we deny as Masons that any civil government on earth has the right to divide or curtail Masonic jurisdiction when once established. It can only be done by competent Masonic authority and in accordance with Masonic usage.\" ‐‐ [From the] Grand Lodge Report . \"A 'due summons' from the lodge or Grand Lodge is obligatory upon him, and should he refuse obedience he will be disgracefully expelled from the society with public marks of ignominy that can never be erased.\" ‐‐ [That's from the] Morris Dictionary of Freemasonry, page [number] 29 . \"Disobedience and want of respect to Masonic superiors is an offense for which the transgressor subjects himself to punishment.\" ‐‐ [That's from] Mackey, Masonic Jurisprudence, page 511 . \"Hence we find that the Master's authority in the lodge is as despotic as the sun in the firmament which was placed there by the Creator, never to deviate from its accustomed course, till the declaration is promulgated that time shall be no more.\" ‐‐ [That's from Oliver's] Signs and Symbols of Freemasonry, page 142 . \"Treason and rebellion also, because they are altogether political offences, cannot be inquired into by a lodge; and although a Mason may be convicted of either of these acts in the courts of his country, he cannot be masonically punished; and notwithstanding his 227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"treason or rebellion his relation to the lodge, to use the language of the old charges, remains indefeasible.\" ‐‐ [That's from Mackey's] Masonic Jurisprudence, page 510 . [William Cooper]: Now, I'm going to read that again and I want you to pay close attention. \"Treason and rebellion also, because they are altogether political offences, cannot be inquired into by a lodge; and although a Mason may be convicted of either of these acts in the courts of his country, he cannot be masonically punished; and notwithstanding his treason or rebellion his relation to the lodge, to use the language of the old charges, remains indefeasible.\" ‐‐ [That's from Mackey's] Masonic Jurisprudence, page 510 . \"There is no duty more forcibly enjoined in Masonry than that of warning a brother or danger impending to his person or interests. To neglect this is a positive violation of obligation, and destroys any person's claim to be entitled a Mason.\" ‐‐ [That's from Morris'] Dictionary of Freemasonry, page [number] 325 . \"The powers and privileges of the Master of a lodge are by no means limited in extent.\" ‐‐ [That's from Chase's] Digest of Masonic Law, page 380 . \"As a presiding officer the Master is possessed of extraordinary powers, which belong to the presiding officer of no other association.\" ‐‐ [That's from] Mackey, Masonic Jurisprudence, page 344 . \"The system of Masonic law has little of the republican or democratic spirit about it.\" [That's from] Morris, Webb's Freemason's Monitor, revised edition, page 195 . \"'Once a Mason, always a Mason ‐‐ once a Mason everywhere a Mason. However independent wither as individuals or as lodges, whether grand or subordinate ‐‐ and we are each and all truly free and uncontrolled by anything save our ancient laws and constitution ‐‐ yet no Mason can be a foreigner to another Mason. We are all equal citizens of one common government, having equal rights, equal privileges and equal duties; and in which government, thank God, the majority does not govern. For our order in its very constitution strikes at the root of that which is the very basis of popular government. It proclaims and practices, not that the will of the masses is wise and good, and as such to be obeyed; not that the majority shall govern, but that the law [ i.e. , above mentioned ancient law] shall govern. Our tenet is not only that no single man but that no body of men (however wise of numerous), can change in any degree one single landmark of our ancient institution. Our law is strictly organic; it cannot be changed without being destroyed. You may take a man to pieces, and you may take a watch to pieces; but you cannot alter his organs and put him together again as you do the time keeper. Masonry is the living man, and all other forms of government mere convenient machines, made by clever mechanics, for regulating the affairs of state. Not only do we know no North, no South, no East and no West, but we know no government save our own. To every government save that of Masonry, and to each and all alike, we are foreigners ; and this form of government is neither pontifical, autocratic, monarchial, republican, democratic nor despotic; it is a government per se , and that government is Masonic. We have nothing to do with forms of government, forms of religion, or forms of social life. We are a nation of men only bound to each other by Masonic ties, as citizens of the world, and that world the world of Masonry; brethren to each other all the world over, foreigners to all the world beside.' \"The above is a Masonic address in a nut ‐ shell; it is the compressed essence of Masonic life.\" ‐‐ [It's taken from the] Missouri Grand Lodge Report for 1867 . What a remarkable array of Masonic testimony! And yet the half has not been told. I might go on almost indefinitely showing its foul, treasonable and anti ‐ republican nature, as legibly portrayed under these extracts from standard Masonic publications. The above sentences are complete quotations and not garbled. They are concise and plain. The language is authoritative. Masonic superiors never argue with subordinates. They dictate. No wonder a most prominent member admits the following: \"There is no charge more frequently made against Freemasonry that that of its tendency to revolution and conspiracy, and to political organizations which may affect the peace of society or interfere with the rights of government.\" [Taken from] Mackey, Mystic Tie of Freemasonry, page 43 . Remember, my friend Dover, that I am not speaking of your nephew's personal views of the supremacy of the lodge, nor saying what he would do if he should find that some of the laws, summons or orders of the lodge should conflict with his duties to the government, but merely showing you what the lodge, according to its standard authors, claims, and what every Mason has sworn to perform. If Mr. Bates should go to congress and then find in some cases that he must violate either his official oath or Masonic Obligation, I do not say which he would consider binding; but I do say, for I know, that the lodge by its writers, its lecturers and its decrees declares that its obligations are supreme, its authority above all civil authority, and obedience to his superiors the first duty of every Mason. If eminent members know and tell the truth about their own order, if Grand Lodge reports can be believed, there can be no doubt on this point. Please read 228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"again carefully what these have said, yes, dared to print, and you will see our objection to sending Bates to congress, or electing him or any Mason to any office until he renounces his allegiance to the lodge. Do you think that we demand too much? Every other foreigner, before he is allowed even to vote, must renounce his allegiance to the government under which he was born, and to which perhaps he has never sworn or acknowledged obedience. We require of him, and properly, the following obligation: \"I do declare an oath that it is bona fide my intention to become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce and abjure forever all allegiance and fidelity to all and every foreign prince, potentate, state and sovereign, and particularly [William Cooper: blank, fill in whatever country he came from], of whom I am a subject.\" Is it then right for free citizens of this country to vote into any office a person who has sworn and still lives under and acknowledges allegiance to another ‐‐ a monarchial and a despotic government? Has not the Grand Lodge of one state, in consistency with the general teaching of Masonry declared that all its members are foreigners to our government? Let us then consider them as such; and our government also should consider them as such, and forbid them to hold office, sit on the jury, or even to vote until they take the oath prescribed for other foreigners. When I tell you that the \"Most Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander of the United States,\" of whom every Mason in the country is a sworn subject, is an ex ‐ confederate general, whose rebel hands are deeply dyed by the crimson blood of loyal citizens, and who at one battle of the late war led a brigade of Indians against the boys in blue, who, by these cruel savages, were murdered, scalped and mutilated in a manner too barbarous for description, you will see more force in this argument. And why was not the arch traitor, the leader of the rebellion, hung when captured? He and the president of the United States and many congressmen and judges were Royal Arch Masons, and had sworn each to the following: \"Furthermore, do I promise and swear, that I will aid and assist a companion Royal Arch Mason when engaged in any difficulty; and espouse his cause so far as to extricate him from the same, if in my power, whether he be right or wrong.\" Is it not reasonable then to suppose that these men, who had sworn to fulfill their duties as civil officers, chose rather to obey Masonic obligations and extricate a rebel from his difficulty? This is the only explanation of this strange event which is worthy of any consideration. And it is made more certain when we remember that, according to Mackey's Jurisprudence , \"Treason and rebellion also, because they are altogether political offenses, cannot be inquired into by the lodge.\" These facts concerning the oaths and teachings of the lodge will explain many other strange things in the history of our country. They will often explain why some improper person is nominated and elected to some office, or the illegal contestant is given the seat, or a criminal is acquitted or pardoned, and perhaps promoted. Why was our present representative, who you say has not brains enough to be a pettifogging lawyer, and who is notoriously dishonest, sent to congress? Why was he nominated by our party? In answer to this question The Wasp , whose editor is an anti ‐ monopolist, but also inconsistently a Mason, says: \"Because, as the superintendent of our main railway told a prominent man before the convention which nominated him, the present incumbent was this company's most available candidate because he was high up in Masonry.\" Thus he admits that the lodge is used for the purpose of securing improper nominations and electing to office unworthy men, and certainly implies that it is used to control them while in office. So you see our objection to any Mason going to congress, and our only objection to the nomination of Mr. Bates. The one condition on which we will give him our united and hearty support is that he goes before the clerk of the United States Court and takes the oath required of all foreigners, inserting the word Freemasonry in the blank. I have given you freely and honestly a lengthy statement of this case; but if there is anything further you desire to know I would be glad to answer your inquires. I should be glad to receive a visit from you at any time. Yours, Warren Groves. N.R. Dover, Princeton. (end of quote) ========================================================================== Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you understand the import of what I have just read to you, and I hope that you understand that many of the leaders in the patriot community are Freemasons.

I'm your host, William Cooper. (audio playback begins) [Dwayne Walker (DW)]: Is there a group of men and women out there who are secretly controlling our finances, our media communications and every aspects of our lives? Well, my two guests think that they very well might be. Uh, we have Jordan Maxwell, who has made an appearance in Ancient Mysteries of the Bible on CBS with William Devane hosting it, and he's agreed to come back and do the sequel, and we have Anthony J. Hilder, of Radio Free World. Uh, Jordan Maxwell's name, there's a quote that I'd like to bring to your attention and I'd like to start off with, uh, Jordan answering this. \"It is probable that most of the public figures and military men involved in the secret scheme are unaware of the real goals or who is really behind it.\" Jordan, I gotta ask, what's...what's going on here? [Jordan Maxwell (JM)]: (laughs) Well let's, let's start with a term that we're hearing quite a bit about in the last couple of years: The New World Order. Our president is going all around the world proclaiming a New World Order. Incidentally, all the presidents, living presidents, along with many of the heads of states throughout the world are going to meet, according to the L.A. Times, are going to meet in the year 2000 at the pyramid in Egypt to bring in what is called the New World Order. There is something going on here on an international worldwide scale right before our eyes, but that so many of us are unaware and, consequently, we're not really seeing what is happening. There is, in fact, a conspiracy or a planned world domination coming by this thing that George Bush calls, a \"New World Order.\" On the back of the one dollar bill, there are a lot of important occult symbolism on the back of the one dollar bill [sic]. On the left ‐ hand side, you'll see the pyramid, and the pyramid of Egypt. It's an Egyptian pyramid on an American dollar bill. The significance is very important. Above the pyramid, you will see the words, Annuit Cœptis , which basically means in Latin, \"Our enterprise is a success,\" or \"Our project has been crowned with success.\" And the project, which is the success, is on the banner beneath the pyramid: Novus Ordo Seclorum , being Latin for \"New Order of the World,\" or the \"New World Order.\" On the bottom of the pyramid you will see the Roman numerals for 1776. This exact, identical emblem of the pyramid within the circle, the Novus Ordo Seclorum , it was not original in America [sic]. It was first found on writings that are today in museums in Europe in the year 1774, 1775, by a man named Adam Weishoff, who founded the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati, a secret society of Freemasons operating in Europe that had designs on the entire world to bring about what they called a New World Order. So that emblem on the back of the dollar bill, on the left ‐ hand side, with the pyramid is not an American symbol. It is a very old symbol coming from... [Anthony Hilder (AH)]: Jordan, you should bring up the fact that this is the Order of the Illuminati... [JM]: Yes. [AH]: ...and the May 1st, 1776 did not signify the creation of the United States of America... [JM]: No, no. [AH]: ...but the Order of the Illuminati, or the Enlightened Ones, or the Luciferians. [JM]: Yes. 231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"[AH]: And this is a Satanic symbol. It is on the cover of the Illuminati documents from May 1st, 1776, which obviously precedes the birth of this nation on July 4th, 1776. On the very top of the pyramid, there is the Apu, the all ‐ seeing eye, which was the name of the Soviet secret police during the Stalin era. [DW]: Alright, now Anthony, you've done, you've spent most of your life studying these secret societies and the Illuminati and you, uh, put out a record sometime ago, called the Illuminati CFR... [AH]: CFR, Council on Foreign Relations, right. [DW]: Right. This is, you know, I've heard various charlatans coming out talking about the Illuminati, but I was wondering if you could get into a little more detail about the history of this organization and some of the more ‐‐ uh, you were talking about, uh, the eagle, for instance, and the pyramids, that sort of thing...and talk a little bit more about the Freemason origins of the Illuminati. [JM]: Well, let me just make this one comment first, and then Anthony can go on with it. The ‐‐ at the top of the pyramid, you'll see the little triangle with the eye in it, the eye was the eye of Horus. Horus was the eye of God, the sun. And so, the sun represented the pupil, or the eye of God in the ancient Egyptian philosophy, and that's why you'll see the light emanating from around the eye. So, it's the worship of light, Luciferianism is the worship of coming forth of light into the world and, therefore, our masters, these manipulating masters behind the scenes of world government, who are manipulating all peoples, uh, consider themselves to be enlightened, enlightened despots, enlightened people. And, of course, when you go to university [sic], you graduate from a university, you wear the Masonic square of Freemasonry on your head to symbolize that you are an alumni. Alumni comes from the word, \"illumini,\" [sp?] you have been illuminated into the enlightened power structure of the New World Order. That's the actual basis for these symbols, and to go on with the rest of the symbolism... [AH]: Well, I think it's important to bring up the fact that George Bush did not write the New World Order. In fact, if you want to know who wrote the New World Order, you simply go back to Adolf Hitler. It wasn't his first book, that was Mein Kampf . The second book, The New World Order . And Rudolph Hess went out and said, in introduction of Hitler, he said, \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer.\" One world, one race, one ruler. That's what this whole United Nations is all about. I'm for a free world that's in total opposition to the New World Order. [DW]: Well, Bush's New World Order may have come from Adolf Hitler, but Bill Clinton's new covenant really comes from the Old Testament. [JM]: Alright, the \"new covenant,\" that is a catchphrase, that is a term which has been used for, uh, at least five hundred years by a secret society of Freemasons in Europe called the British Israel World Federation. British Israel World Federation, you can see, uh, topics in movies based on this subject like, there's a motion picture that just came out, called The Handmaiden's Pail , based on British Israel philosophy for America. A secret society of Freemasons promoting something that is called as far back as five hundred years ago, \"British Israel philosophy,\" \"Anglo ‐ Israel philosophy,\" which is tying in the Old Testament governmental system to be the basis for a New World Order in the coming future. And that's why, uh, this symbol is... [DW]: Well, Clinton went to Oxford... [JM]: Yeah. [DW]: ...and [you would have to be] a Rhodes scholar. [JM]: Right. The Rhodes Scholarship Foundation, and this whole thing of a \"new covenant\" comes directly from British Israel Freemasonry. Rhodes scholar, the Rhodes scholarship of England. So, we can get into that, it gets ‐‐ we can get into all of these. There's a significance of the Democratic party, uh, his term of the covenant, the \"new covenant.\" [AH]: And Cecil Rhodes is the founder of Rhodesia, that's where Rhodesia got its name. And we had a little thing called the Round Table, and...some of these Luciferian groups, and I say Luciferian, I mean it, like George Bush is a member of the Skull and Bones. Now, in the Skull and Bones fraternity ‐‐ this is a fraternity, a Faustian financial fraternity that started up in Yale University in 1832, came over here as a bounce off the Jacobin Society, who was involved in the French Revolution in the reign of terror. At Yale University, they have a structure, and you can go there, anybody can go there and see this structure they call a tomb. Inside the tomb they have, uh, their initiation and the fellas, they lay down in a coffin, and George Bush was one of them. They laid down in a coffin, nude, and they're born again in to this Satanic order. It's the ritual, it's been there. William Buckley, Jr., the Herrimans, yeah...conservatives, no. George Bush isn't a conservative... 232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"[JM]: Never have... [AH]: ...Ronald Reagan was never a conservative. In fact, uh, Ronald Reagan is so far left, let me ‐‐ can I say this? ‐‐ Ronald Reagan is not a conservative. He never was a conservative, he is not a conservative, he never will be a conservative. In the early days they used to call him, \"Red Ronnie.\" It's as simple as that. (laughs) He was in the United World Federalists for thirteen years. He was in the L.A. Committee for a Democratic far ‐ eastern policy, which was associated with the Institute of Pacific Relations, which was listed as an instrument of the Soviet Union. This guy is so far ‐ left, he makes Fidel Castro look like a member of the John Burke's Society. All you've ever heard about Ronald Reagan was simply rhetoric. We have a one ‐ party system controlled by this oligarchy. [DW]: Alright, that's George Bush, that's, uh, the Skull and Bones society and I ‐‐ OK, I guess I can see this ‐‐ but Bill Clinton, though, um...he was not a member of the Skull and Bones society. [AH]: No, I believe you – is Bill Clinton a member of the Council of Foreign Relations? [JM]: Oh yes, he certainly is, the CFR... [AH]: And is George Bush a member of the Council of Foreign Relations? [JM]: Yeah, of course, I... [DW]: Bill Clinton wasn't lying naked in a coffin trying to get born again... [AH]: No, no, no, that ‐‐ but let me go back to an election, 1980. We had Jimmy Carter from the Trilateral Commission, we had George Bush from the Trilateral Commission, and John Anderson from the Trilateral Commission as the Independent ticket. So, it wouldn't make any difference which way the coined flipped: heads they win, tails we lose. Or tails we win, heads they... [JM]: The Rockefellers never lost an election in the last sixty years. [AH]: Well, no, we lose, even if the coin landed on its side. They had all bases covered. [DW]: Aren't you ‐‐ you know, you mentioned the Trilateral Commission, and you mentioned the Rockefeller's. I've heard many fringe groups, ranging from the fundamentalists up to the neo ‐ Nazis or whatever, taking bits and pieces of this thing and constructing it to their own agenda. Aren't you worried about being misinterpreted, and... [AH]: They all have their own spin... [JM]: Everybody has their own spin on it, right. Their own agenda, but what we're talking about is things that can be proven from accepted referenced works, and how you use that information to promote your own philosophy, your own agenda is ‐‐ that's their problem. [DW]: And there is ‐‐ you're saying there is proof that, from May 1st, 1776, that the organization, the Illuminati can... [JM]: Oh yes, you can look that up... [DW]: ...and to this very day, the Illuminati is still around ..[inaudible] [JM]: Of course. [AH]: ...the cover of their document is the left ‐ hand side, the reversal of the dollar bill. It was put on there early on, but it was the reverse Seal early on. But it. wasn't until the corncob mystic, vice ‐ President George, uh ‐‐ no, not George Wallace, but Henry Wallace... [JM]: Henry C. Wallace. [AH]: ...who talked to Roosevelt and said, \"Hey, this thing has got to go on there.\" Now, he had in the White House a little shrine for Madame [Helena P.] Blavatsky. I mean, Blavatsky wrote, uh... [JM]: Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine . [AH]: Yeah, but she had a manifesto going. She also had a publication of a book ‐‐ uh, well, I've seen the book. It's the combined works of 233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Lucifer. She had Lucifer Magazine , and I've held those copies of Lucifer in my hand...leather ‐ bound. Uh, she was the, uh, publisher and co ‐ editor with Annie Basant, and from this Lucifer organization came theosophy, and there's only ‐‐ and from theosophy came unity, came, what is, uh... [JM]: Yes, the other... [AH]: This one ‐ world religion, philosophy...and if you go the United Nations, they've got a meditation room and you'll find out that the high religion is the only one that is accepted in the United Nations. And in the mediation room, you're going to find a little Illuminati pyramid. So, they ‐‐ it's loaded with symbology and Jordan Maxwell is the expert on it... [JM]: ...and what I was going to say, too, was that the United Nations uses a particular publishing firm for all of their documents [in public] and books and materials,and its called Lucis Publishing. [And] the United Nations uses Lucis Publishing. Lucis Publishing was at one time Helena Blavatsky's Lucifer Publishing. So, uh, to date... [AH]: Funded by the Lucifer Trust. [JM]: The Lucifer Trust, the United Nations, that's why it's in New York, because New York is referred to as, \"The Empire State,\" because it's the new state of the new empire that is coming. That's why Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, with their Indiana Jones and The Empire Strikes Back , it has to do with occultism, it has to do with numerology, it has to do with a lot of mysticism coming out of theosophy. Uh, the point being is that we are involved in some very powerful occult, uh, manipulation of the world by some very astute occultists. And we are not even beginning to be aware of how far gone we are... [AH]: And it's crazy to have a united world government. I don't want to do away with our individuality. Some people are white, some people are black, tall, short, fat, thin, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Jews. I like the diversity. I don't want to see a world with two hundred and twenty nations, I want to see a world with maybe three thousand nations. I believe in the right to integrate, to segregate, to separate, to have linguistic tribal nation states emerge where there are these people. Like in Africa ‐‐ and I've lived there for a while ‐‐ where the Matabeles have been fighting the Mashonas. Let them have their own nation states. Let that division take place. Let there be a free world alliance. Let there be a Croatia, let there be a Serbia. Let all individuals separate and find a place that is comfortable. Let them do their own thing in their own time in their own way. If somebody wants to be a racist, let them be a racist. Let them have a racist state. Let Israel exist; it is a religious state. It has a racist philosophy, fine. But let there be a Palestine, let there be an independent Gaza. I would like to see the secession of Alaska. I worked there in Radio Free America for three ‐ and ‐ a ‐ half years. I called for the independence of Alaska. It should be an independent nation. [DW]: Well, you know, when you ‐‐ you're mentioning all this conspiracy stuff. Now, I'm thinking that, you know, when various things happen like when the [L.A.] riots happened, um, about six months ago. [AH]: April 29th and May 1st [sic]... [DW]: Right, but when it happened and when just about everything bad in our society has happened, not just the riots ‐‐ I mean, it's almost tempting to want to believe that there are people behind there pulling the strings and all that, because it causes the false sense of security that, if we can just stop these people, we can have a better life, and that sort of thing... [AH]: But we can have a better life if we stop these people... [DW]: You don't think there's people today ‐‐ people just making mistakes, and that maybe you're just reading thing ‐‐ these things... [AH]: How can everything happen just accidentally? I mean, uh, everything goes wrong and it happens to go wrong every time, everywhere, and we've been getting worse off and worse off and worse off. Ronald Reagan and George Bush, who are supposed to be conservatives, quote conservatives, tripled the national debt. I mean, all of the, the debt that was acquired from George Washington through Jimmy Carter, they tripled the national debt and then reporters get out there and say, \"Hey, I'm thinking that these guys are conservative.\" They're not conservative. [DW]: But can't you just write it up to a bad economic plan instead of saying there are people behind this (inaudible)... [AH]: By design... [JM]: Let me explain something to you... [AH]: ...not a bad economic plan! 234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"[JM]: ...you do not get to the President of the United States and you do not have hundreds of advisors, highly educated proficient advisors in every field of human activity and human endeavor, getting C2 reports every day from the CIA, you getting [sic] USIA, DIA documentation every hour on the hour for the economy of the world, all things happening in the earth being directed to the President's table. You don't make mistakes when you have become President. You have the finest minds in the world working for you, the finest intellects that the western world can produce. That's why you ‐ that's why in a dog ‐ eat ‐ dog world, our country is the most powerful economic society on earth, because we are a very powerfully intellectual society. We don't make mistakes.

Why is it that we don't, uh, talk about this organization? If they were members of the Nazi party, if they were members of the Boy Scouts, or, uh, some drag queen over in West Hollywood, we would be talking about them! There would be front ‐ page headlines, but the Trilateral Commission, seventy ‐ eight, ninety [sic] people who controls all three candidates for the President of the United States in 1980?

We can only E ‐ lect , which means that we can only vote for those candidates which were put before us by our masters, our hidden masters behind the scenes. And when you understand that the Democratic and the Republican party are financed, and believe me, in this world, money is the bottom line, if you have it or you don't [sic]. And the Democratic and the, uh, Republican party are financed and organized and directed by the same banking families: the same people who finance your banks are the same people who finance your institutions of government. Uh, as a matter of fact, the word for \"bench,\" in relationship to a judge sitting on the bench, comes from \"bankol(sp?),\" which is in Latin, meaning \"the bank.\" The judge sits on the bench, which is a Latin word for \"the bank.\" He officiates for the system. So when you go into the court, you're sitting before a court of order, which is actually being financed by government. So what we're talking about here is the system...

[JM]: No. [AH]: They create that fiat funny money that you use. It's judt like Monopoly money. For less than a penny a note, they lend it to the U.S. Treasury in exchange for interest ‐ bearing bonds.

You don't have to tell anyone. [AH]: It used to say, \"and is redeemable and lawful money...\" [JM]: Yes. [AH]: ...in lawful ‐ redeemable and lawful money. That meant it wasn't ‐ it's not lawful money. It's not a dollar. If you have a piece of toilet paper, it can be used and tossed away, but as soon as you print, \"Federal Reserve note,\" it becomes an obligation of the public to pay. [JM]: So, what we're saying is that the Federal Reserve system has nothing whatsoever to do with the federal government. Just like \"Federal Vacuum Cleaners\" and \"Federated Department Stores\" has [sic] nothing to do with ‐ it's a word, it is a play on words. A Federal Reserve system is a private banking institution, with most of its holders, um, .... [AH]: The Class A stockholders have never been revealed to the United States public.

And the Capitol Building sits there ‐ it's a pyramid, then it has the, uh, Cleopatra's needle, which is the Washington Monument, and the, and the river ‐ the long river way, the long water way is called the river Styx, which is where Pharaoh went into Heaven, on the river Styx. It is all laid out in Masonic symbolism and the five ‐ pointed star, which is the pentagram, has always been used, Satan worship, Satanic worship the five ‐ pointed pentagram. And if you take the arms off of the pentagram, you have a pentagon, and the United States Pentagon is sitting exactly due north, aiming due north at the North Star, Thuban, which is drawing power, according to the ancient Egyptians, for the god of war.

Are you referring ‐ or Satanic ‐ do you mean the elevation of human reason, or do ‐ the, uh, strong survive ‐ or do you mean a group of people who are actually worshiping a bonafide, spiritual, uh... [AH]: We're talking about the warlocks of Washington, here. We're talking about people who have Satanic rituals. We're talking about people who believe in a Lucifer 2000. We're talking about, uh, the creation of a New World Order in a millennium, when George Bush talks about a thousand points of light. What do you think he's talking about, a thousand points of light? Could it be a thousand ‐ year millennium under Lucifer? What do you think, Jordan? [JM]: Yes, there's no doubt in my mind at all; the terminology is the same. When you go back through the speeches that Adolf Hitler made, and the top Nazi speech writers, and then listen to what Ronald Reagan had to say, and George Bush, and now our new incoming president... [AH]: Well, Hilter talked about a thousand points of, uh ‐ he's talked about a thousand ‐ year Reich, and Bush is talking about a thousand points of light. And, you ‐ I don't think it's just a coincidence... [JM]: And not points of light... [AH]: ...and after Hitler's second book is... [DW]: ...not points of light? [JM]: And he ‐ his term, Bush is... [AH]: New World Order and a religious new order... [JM]: ...talking about thousand points of light, thousand points of light. Light is very important to Luciferians. It has to do with Lucifer, and it has to do with Satanic societies, and what, what we're saying here is that the government of the United States is in the hands of some very powerful, sinister people who are manipulating not only us, but the rest of the world. [AH]: If you can take a look at ‐ just take a road map of Washington, D.C. Just take a look at it from the air, and you'll see what appears to be the Goat of Mendes, and the Goat of Mendes... [JM]: Which is a symbol in Freemasonry. It's a symbol, it's a demonic symbol within the (inaudible) [AH]: ...you see the goat and the horns and the whole thing. The whole city is laid out like that. It's all over. [JM]: So, what we're basically saying here is that there is nothing happening by chance. Uh, as I brought out before, the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with their Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , and the last Crusade is for the Holy Grail, the cup of Christ. It's not by chance that we have movies like that, because they're in ‐ why is Adolf Hitler always involved with Indiana Jones? Uh, the last Crusade you can't understand unless you understand the first Crusade. The first Crusade was, was developed by what we call the Knights Templars Masonic Lodge. The Knight Templars are the ones that gave us what we call the Columbian faction of the Illuminati, which comes to America and founds itself in the state of New York, which comes from the old York Rite in England, from the Duke of York to Old York, England, to New York, the Empire State. Then, if you understand that, uh, Europe was dominating ‐ Europe has dominated the world for almost sixteen hundred years, and we refer to Europe as the Old World. Therefore, the power structure of Europe is the Old World Order, that's the power structure of the Old World. [DW]: We're going to be doing more of this.

[JM]: We're hearing this term, \"New World Order,\" and our troops are in the Middle East because of something called a \"New World Order.\" I just wanted to bring, uh, to your attention the reason for that term. Europe is referred to as the Old World, and the power structure of the Old World was referred to as the \"Old World Order\". I mean, the old Roman dynasties, the Rothschild's of England, the banking dynasties throughout Europe, and the whole power structure of what we call Europe was the European Old World Order, and it dominated the world for almost sixteen hundred years, Europe has dominated the world [sic]. But with the coming of America, or Christo ‐ Columbia (?), uh, the founding of America, we now are in what we called New World. Consequently, there is a new world power structure in Western civilization, and, uh, centered in America, and so that's what George Bush is talking about, a New World Order is a new world fraternal order, because the world in the dictionary means a fraternal, or knightly order, uh, like the Masonic Order or Lodge. And so, what we're talking about the Old World Order is a power structure centered in the New World. And we're seeing terminologies in movies and motion pictures like we said, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas with The Empire Strikes Back . It has to do with New York being the Empire State, the state of the new empire, connecting New York with the old York dynasty in England, and, uh, America strikes back at the Old Order, which is the first and second World War, and if you understand the connections between the Vatican and the European banking families, and Europe being the Old World Order, as opposed to America being, uh, a New World Order. And the empire strikes back, and of course the head of the ‐ all Freemasons will recognize that Yota is little Yuda, or Yota is the ideologue of the Knights Templars Freemasonic Order, giving us what we call the York Rite, or New York. And, so all of these things are mystical symbols and emblems, and from that, we can open up a can of words, and all kinds of... [AH]: But it gets down to the bottom line, the bottom line of this whole thing is one world government. [JM]: Right.

And how are they going to do that? Designer diseases. It's my thesis, it's Dr. Robert Strecker's thesis, that they have created AIDS, and disseminated AIDS through the Hepatitis B vaccinate shots to the homosexual community in the United States with the Public Health Service, and to the blacks in Senegal, Uganda, Zaire, the central African republic Haiti and Brazil, for the purpose of reducing the population of the planet by this twenty ‐ five percent by the year 2000 through the smallpox vaccine shots over there. [DW]: Yeah, what I have a, a difficult un ‐ , trying to get by here as a lot of people do too, is you're naming a lot of things: I mane, the Empire State Building with the empire, Yoda with the Knights Templar, now we're talking about AIDS.

[AH]: ...it is a man ‐ made disease, created at Fort Detrick, there's no question in my mind about that. The World Health Organization went out to give these smallpox vaccine shots to the innocent blacks, and AIDS is vector born. AIDS is a cancer. They don't want to come up with a cure until the population of Africa has been diminished substantially. I think that black people in Africa are an endangered species. In south central Los Angeles, not far from where we are right now, at one high school with kids giving blood to the blood bank, it was discovered that there was 90% that were HIV positive. These are teenage black kids. I'm saying that AIDS is not simply epidemic, or pandemic. It's mega ‐ pandemic, and AIDS is murder. This is a designer disease, and it is a program to mass murder people upon the planet to reduce the population. [DW]: Talking about south central, uh, the Illuminati, uh, began, if I'm to understand you right, on May the 1st, 1776, and you were ascribing some sort of significance of the fact that the riot recently happened on... [AH]: May the 1st. [DW]: April 29th to May 1st. [JM]: That's right. May 1st was the founding date of the Bavarian Illuminati in Germany in the year 1776. This you can find in any encyclopedia in any library. Look up the word, \"Illuminati.\" Illuminati comes from \"illumined\" or \"illuminate,\" meaning the worship of light. The Enlightened Ones, those who are the masters who manipulate the world finance and manipulate world government. The Illuminati was founded May 1st, 1776, and that's why in Soviet Union and all Communist countries, you have a great celebration on May Day. May Day was a symbol for – May Day was the celebration of the founding of the world revolution conspiracy in Germany, and then later on goes into France and to, uh... [AH]: ...and I hope they don't have to burn the city before the people see the real light... [JM]: ...and so, that's why our riot that happened here in Los Angeles happened on May 1st. It was all prearranged, pre ‐ setup by this government, had nothing to do with the people in the area. I have talked to many of the black community of the area... [DW]: Wait, wait...you say, \"this government,\" you're talking about those who control this government... [JM]: Yeah, I'm talking about those who control this government, not the government itself, but those who are behind the scenes, who control this government and decide what it will and will not do. [AH]: And control the black projects, the Central Intelligence Agency. [DW]: Are you able to zero in on exactly who these people are who are the government, the government calling themselves...? [AH]: The invisible government, talking about the invisible government. [DW]: Yeah. [AH]: I talk about it as an evilarchy. [DW]: Well, are you able to tear ‐‐ zero in on who these people are in this evilarchy? [AH]: As a group, the members of the Council on Foreign Relations. I'm not saying all members of the Council on Foreign Relations are Illumnists. Members of the Trilateral Commission, members of the Club of Rome, the Skull and Bones fraternity, the Bohemian society ‐‐ here's a group of presidents up there with black robes, like Klansmen, sitting around this huge bonfire at the Bohemian Grove, uh, worshiping this giant owl. [JM]: Yeah, we have color pictures of this, we have color pictures of the presidents of the United States, all living presidents today, uh, dressed in large black robes with pointed headdresses like the Ku Klux Klan in front of a large open fire pit, a pit of fire, uh, in the article 239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"appeared said that it was after twelve midnight, all the American presidents line up on this altar, and worship the owl.

The owl is wise because it sees things in the dark, and that's why the presidents and the heads of state and the heads of the government that we live under, all meet at one o'clock, at twelve o'clock at night, uh, to worship the owl. [AH]: Yeah, but if you don't believe it, if you don't believe it, we will come back and do another show and Jordan will pull out pictures... [DW]: Yes, I want to see those pictures. [AH]: ...and you can zero in on Gerald Ford, who has some sort of Satanic shrine at his home, as I understand it from inside sources. Uh, I had talked to one fellow at a ‐‐ this is in Anaheim years ago, at Knott's Berry Farm after a Billy James Hargis meeting, who claimed to be a member of some witches coven. He mentioned two congressmen which were involved in Satanic cults, and they were, I guess, warlocks. And, uh, I only remembered one, because he was the number one congressman for the Republican party, the House minority leader, Gerald Ford, then later the selected, non ‐ elected President, who then selected the non ‐ elected vice ‐ President, Nelson Rockefeller. So, we had a President and vice ‐ President of the United States that were not elected by us, but selected by them. And if you take a look at the administrations of Ronald Reagan, who said that Jimmy Carter should be criticized, or criticize Carter for having had eighteen members of the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission appointed to key positions in his administration. Ronald Reagan had an excess of two hundred. He's as phony as a three ‐ dollar bill. Ronald Reagan is not a right ‐ winger, folks. He is a phony, he is a phony, he is a phony.

I was wondering if you can spell that out for me. [AH]: Now, I've done an article, called Global 2000 . There's a thing out there, and you've read it in Life Magazine . You've seen the front cover of the NASA SETI program. You've seen the big, big, uh, picture from outer space and, uh, they talked about a hundred million dollar investment. A hundred million dollars to invest, to find out whether there is extraterrestrial intelligence. Well, there's, there's – they got something going, here. You remembered War of the Worlds ? [DW]: The radio broadcast? [AH]: Yes, by Orson Welles in 1939? [DW]: Mmhmm, yes. [AH]: Well, we've got something else coming in. They're going to make the announcement that they have discovered extraterrestrial intelligence! And this will frighten the people of the world, saying, \"Oh my God! How can we deal with this as a nation? Well, we can only deal with it as the United Nations, yes! We're going to have a United Nations, a one ‐ world government, yeah. It's necessary,\" they're going to say. \" It's absolutely necessary.\" Why? [DW]: Tell me. [AH]: To defend ourselves from those little green men, from the aliens that are out there. They will make that announcement, and the whole program is phony. It stinks, it's setup and you're going to be the patsy, unless you understand what's going down and who's doing what to whom.

They can't even grow enough potatoes to make vodka, they have to import the potatoes, they haven't even got a railroad track across their country; they're starving, they have always been starving, they're broke, and the only military materials that had was the stuff that we sent to them that we aren't even using anymore, shelves of rockets, shelves of planes, and it's just an evil empire on paper. They're starving. 240"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"[AH]: You asked about this Luciferian thing by the year 2000.

[AH]: Something like that. It's already gone. It's on its way, folks. It's going to Jupiter. It's going to reach the planet by 1995, it's going to circle the planet... [JM]: Mmhmm. [AH]: ...and then by 1999, it's going to be drawn into the planet, where it will simply explode. What does it have on it? It's got 49 ¼ pounds of plutonium, even for...well, let's say, ten hydrogen bombs. What is the atmosphere of Jupiter made up of? Hydrogen. Now this, if it could ‐‐ if it were to be ignited, it would give us a second sun. [JM]: Right. [AH]: And I thought, my God...year 2000, a second sun. Where have I read that before? Something struck me ‐‐ I said, wait a minute,..Arthur C. Clark, 2010: Odyssey 2 . I went back to the last chapter. Guess what the last chapter is called? \"Lucifer Rising.\" And he talks about the ignition of the planet Jupiter by the year 2010. And, he said at the very end of the book – and you can read it, go to the library, pick it up, look at it – he said that the NASA space program was interested, a Dr. Robert Jathro, I think it was, or Jethro, was interested in this particular thesis for the Galileo mission. So we're talking about a space exploration program, that not only is going to go, it already went up. That was in 1982. This was sent up five years later. It's already on its way. If that thing ignites, it would give us a dual solar system... [JM]: So what we're talking about is two sides... [AH]: ...and they rename the planet from Jupiter to Lucifer. [JM]: Right. [AH]: That's exactly what Arthur C. Clark talks about in 2010, so we're talking about Lucifer 2000. [JM]: There'll be no more nighttime, so there'll be more no opportunity for crime at night. There'll be more sun now, because you will have two suns now in our solar system, so that you can increasing (growing system)...

The fact is, is that this thing is carrying plutonium, it's going to Jupiter and they know what it's going to do when it does crash. So... [AH]: And as NASA said in their space program, could be used as a vehicle to frighten the people of the planet into surrendering their sovereignty into accepting a one ‐ world government. And they've talked about a thing out here called the Federal Emergency Management Association, which came, en masse , when the riots took place. They create chaos, and they create control. [JM]: Over the world headquarters in Switzerland of the world Masonic headquarters for world Freemasonry, over the door is Ordo Ab Chao , which is Latin for \"Order out of Chaos.\" And all Freemasons know that term, Ordo Ab Chao . Order out of chaos; the concept is to create chaos, to create the problems, then while the people are frightened to death of all the crime and everything that seems to be out of control, a riotous situation, the government then moves in with justification. In order to put down this terrible chaos, they must have full power of the military, full obedience of the people to give the government full power to do whatever they want. That's why we have, in all over the world, wars, riots, bloodshed, famines, all kinds of things happening around the world, is being manipulated. It's being orchestrated, not just for Los Angeles, but... [AH]: It's conflict control. [JM]: Conflict control.

I'm not looking to any of this. I, my belief is, is that knowledge is the thing that's needed. People need to wake up and discover who is running their government, what the symbols of government mean, what these emblems mean when they see the national coat of arms, the flags, the emblems, the seals, the symbols.

But, of course, the government has nothing to do with it, and they were... [AH]: They were the bad guys... [JM]: Yeah. [AH]: And the one ‐ world oligarchy is the good guys. [JM]: Of course.

He said that on February 5th, 1941. So they're the same. [JM]: They're identical, absolutely. So, what I'm saying is that, uh, when you get back to the original symbols and emblems of the secret societies and you understand, as Adam Weishoff wrote, which is what I was going to bring out ‐‐ Adam Weishoff wrote that the one thing that bring all nations together, all peoples together, because there's so much differences between races and individuals, but the one thing all individuals will come together for is to save their own hide.

(opening music: Also sprach Zarathustra (theme song of 2001: A Space Odyssey ) by Richard Strauss) Ladies and gentlemen, Lt. Colonel James \"Bo\" Gritz: (audio clip of Lt. Col. Gritz): \"We're gonna have perfect government, but (applause) perfect government is coming soon, and I'm looking forward to it.\" What you have just heard, ladies and gentlemen, is the age ‐ old dream of Mystery Babylon, the Secret Societies, Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, the Knights of Malta, the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross. The age ‐ old dream of a perfect government, permanent Utopia upon this Earth. What is Lt. Colonel James \"Bo\" Gritz talking about, this 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite and member of the branch of Mystery Babylon known as the Mormon Church? What is he talking about? Ladies and gentlemen, that's the subject of tonight's broadcast. It is known as the Secret Kingdom. [reading from The Godmakers , written by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt]: (start of quote) ===================================================== Investigative reporter Jeffrey Kaye concluded, \"The Mormon Church, this American Zion, wields more economic power more effectively than the state of Israel or the Pope in Rome.\" Actually, [dear listeners,] the word church is misleading when applied to Mormondom, for the power structure controlling its staggering resources is organized for the kind of absolute authoritarianism that one usually associates with a cult and not with a responsible church. Nor are the ultimate goals of The Brethren compatible with the normal aims of Christian leaders. [William Cooper: In fact, in no way, shape or form can the Mormon church be called, \"Christian.\"] They are essentially the same as those of cults in general and especially those of secret revolutionary groups working toward a takeover of the world. As one former teacher of Brigham Young University has said: \"The Mormons do intend to take over the world...There is no secret about that ‐‐ it's in the writings of Joseph Smith right on down. The Constitution of the United States will 'hang by a thread' and the church will save it by establishing a theocracy.\" Any who think the Mormon kingdom is a democracy are under a delusion. In fact it is a dictatorship ruled by its inner elite circle[, a council of elders]. As the front page of The Wall Street Journal recently said, \"Today, from their 28th story marble ‐ and ‐ glass Church headquarters building in Salt Lake City, Mormon Church leaders oversee a vast and growing world ‐ wide financial empire.\" From these offices, their dictatorial control reaches out to every Church level and into every facet of Mormon life. Whatever \"vote\" there seems to be at the Ward, Stake, and individual levels is part of a cleverly contrived illusion that continues to deceive millions of Mormons into imagining that they actually have some say in Church affairs. Although they do have the \"freedom\" to disagree with their leaders, to do so means excommunication and damnation. Excommunicated for openly disagreeing with The Brethren's position on ERA, Sonia Johnson has said [this]: \"The Mormon church has become more powerful than we dare believe. It's downright terrifying, especially when you see how rich and influential it is...I really think if we could ever get an investigation, it would uncover something so like 245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Watergate, it would blow everything wide open.\" Totalitarian, Theocratic Communism [seems to be the goal.] Saints Alive was [recently] involved in some litigation arising out a physical attack upon one of its missionaries by an LDS [or Latter ‐ day Saints] tour guide on the street just outside Salt Lake City's Temple Square. In an interrogatory exchange, the surprising response by the Mormon church revealed that it was an unincorporated association without assets ! [William Cooper: Let me repeat that... without assets !] All wealth and power is owned and controlled by the closely held Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter ‐ day Saints, Inc. . [You see, folks,] church members who have faithfully and sacrificially contributed their tithes, time, and energy are [absolutely] powerless to demand an accounting or to change a single action by the First Presidency, even if all [5.2] million of them stood up in unison and \"voted\" unanimously for it. The startling fact[, folks,] is that Mormon Church members have no vote or participation of any kind in the corporate entity that controls Mormondom. They can sincerely perform their functions as Bishops, Elders, High Priests and Sunday school superintendents all they wish, but in the real world[, the real world] of legal ownership and raw power they are only [5.2 million] pawns[. Pawns, fools if you will,] subject to manipulation from the top. All of this is part of a secret kingdom that Jeffrey Kaye has called the \"Invisible Empire\" and about which most Mormons have only the vaguest notions[, if they have any notions at all]. This theocracy was alluded to by late Apostle Bruce R. McConkie: \"Through this church and kingdom a framework has been built through which the full government of God will eventually operate.\" That \"full government of God\" involves what is known as the \"United Order.\" \"Revelations\" that came through Joseph Smith described it as a theocratic communistic society. All property and income was to be given over to the control of the Church and then distributed to everyone according to his need as The Brethren find it, so that \"the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.\" Those who transgressed were to be put out of the Church, in which case the property they had given into the treasury would not be returned to them. Serious problems prevented full implementation of the \"United Order.\" [You see, until now,] it never really worked. However, the Mormon Church still looks forward to the day when these \"revelations\" of God through the \"Prophet\" will be fulfilled and Mormon theocratic communism firmly established worldwide. [And] that can only happen when the Church has taken full political power. When that time comes, woe to all who transgress the \"laws\" of the Mormon gospel. Excommunication with loss of earthly property will be supplemented[, ladies and gentlemen,] with the death penalty. [William Cooper: The United Order is, in reality, the total makeup of the full body of the Illuminati. All of the different organizations will come together to rule the world. There is a doctrine, an ancient pagan doctrine of blood atonement connected to the Mormon church.] [And] since the early days of the church, it has always been Mormon doctrine that \"...under certain circumstances, there are some serious sins for which the cleansing of Christ does not operate, and the law of God is that men must then have their own blood shed to atone for their sins.\" It is generally thought that these \"serious sins\" are in the category of murder and adultery. However, this is not clearly defined in Mormonism. Brigham Young[, a 33rd degree Freemason,] said that \"any man or woman, who violates the covenants made with their God will be required to pay the debt. The blood of Christ will never wipe that out, your own blood must atone for it.\" In the same general vein, President J.M. Grant declared: \"...If they are covenant breakers we need a place designated where we can shed their blood.\" [William Cooper: You see, folks, my prophecy on the Hour of the Time that human sacrifice would return to the world will be fulfilled unless we are smart enough to stop it.] Besides murder and adultery, blood atonement was also advocated for stealing and taking the name of the Lord in vain. Likewise, the penalty for marrying an African \"under the Law of God is death on the spot. This will also be so.\" [William Cooper: The Mormon church is now, and has always been, a white Aryan racist organization, and until recently when threatened with lawsuits, they never allowed any other race then white Caucasians to belong. That's right, folks, and if you are a black American who belongs to the Mormon church, you have really been fooled. All of the secret organizations of Mystery Babylon are racist organizations.] (The 1978 decision opening the priesthood to blacks didn't change that law.) Blood atonement was also required for lying or \"damning old Joe Smith or his religion...\" [William Cooper: I guess that tells you what's going to happen to me. But what about other liars, like Bobo [sic] Gritz? Does it apply to him, or is he excused if he is working in the furtherance of the Great Work or the Great Plan?] That most serious of all crimes, apostasy, bears the death penalty, and those who kill an apostate are saving his soul. This is a real 246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"concern of ex ‐ Mormons. Many have received death threats and some have even been shot at [recently]. Brigham Young was very firm on this subject, as the following excerpt from one of his sermons as reported in Journal of Discourses indicates: \"I say, rather than that apostates should flourish here, I will unsheath my Bowie knife and conquer or die. (Great commotion erupted in the congregation, and a simultaneous burst of feeling, assenting to the declaration.)\" [And he continues:] \"Now, you nasty apostates, clear out, or judgment will be put to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. [And you could hear] voices, generally [saying], 'go it, go it.'\" [And he continues:] \"If you say it is right, raise your hands.\" [All hands in the congregation were raised. Then he continues:] \"Let us call upon the Lord to assist us in this, and every good work.\" [You see, folks, the] doctrine of \"blood atonement\" was practiced in Utah prior to statehood, until the Mormon leadership realized that they must obey federal laws or have them enforced by the United States Army. [William Cooper: And that's the only thing that stopped it from being practiced in the open. It was, for many years, continued in secret, and there are many who swear today that it is still being carried out.] There are rumors that this doctrine is still practiced secretly in Utah today. It would be strange if it were not, for Mormons boast that they of all people \"practice what they believe\"; and as Joseph Fielding Smith said, blood atonement \"is scriptural doctrine and is taught in all the standard works of the Church.\" Certainly, Church leaders would openly carry this out today if they could. In fact, the Utah State Legislature with its Mormon majority has succeeded in legalizing one method of practicing blood atonement. Utah is the only state where the condemned may elect to be executed by a firing squad, which causes his own blood to be shed, and thus why Mormon beliefs atones for his sins. The execution...by a firing squad of condemned murderer Gary Gilmore, who was a Mormon, was a recent example. Brigham Young made blood atonement sound like a generous provision that the guilty would willingly embrace and the executioners gladly perform \"in love\"[; Brigham Young said this]: \"Now, take a person...[who] knows that by having his blood shed he will atone for that sin...is there a man or woman is this house but what would say, 'shed my blood that I may be saved and exalted with the Gods'? He would be glad to have his blood shed...I could refer to plenty of instances where men have been righteously slain in order to atone for their sins...This is loving our neighbors as ourselves...If he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it...That is the way to love mankind.\" Regardless of the understanding of the average Mormon, The Brethren look forward to the day when they will once again be able to practice openly not only polygamy but blood atonement. When will that day come? In answer to that question, Bruce R. McConkie has written: \"This doctrine can only be practiced in its fullness in a day when its civil and ecclesiastical laws are administered in the same kinds.\" If the Mormon church should ever succeed in taking over the world, Mormonism, in its most fanatical and bizarre practices will become the rule enforced, unbendingly upon everyone. Dare anyone call this a conspiracy? Thinking he was denying it, one Mormon recently told us, 'This isn't a conspiracy , it's our destiny !\" As with polygamy in the past, the obsessive ambition of world domination is openly denied today, but secretly plotted. Though less blatantly proclaimed, that ultimate goal hasn't changed since the early days when Mormon leaders brazenly boasted, as First Presidency member Heber C. Kimball declared in 1859: \"...The nations will bow to this kingdom, sooner or later, and all hell cannot help it.\" [William Cooper: The global goal, ladies and gentlemen, is a one ‐ world government, as it is with all the branches of the Illuminati.] Of course, Mormon leaders call their empire the \"kingdom of God.\" However, their \"God\" is an extraterrestrial from Kolob, definitely not the God of the Bible; and the \"Zion\" to which their spirit ‐ brother ‐ of ‐ Lucifer Jesus Christ will return to reign is Independence, Missouri. Most Christians believe, as the Bible declares, that Christ will return to Jerusalem, Israel to establish His millennial kingdom, whereas Mormons believe that they must establish a worldwide Mormon kingdom dictated from their Missouri base in order to make it possible for Christ to return. Therein lies a great difference, which is why the Mormon hierarchy, beginning with Joseph Smith himself, has always had worldwide and absolute political power as its goal. Mormon historian Klaus J. Hansen has written, \"The idea of a political kingdom of God, promulgated by a secret Council of Fifty, is by far the most important key to an understanding of the Mormon past.\" Mormon writer John J. Stewart has said: \"The Prophet established a confidential Council of Fifty, or 'Ytfif,' (Fifty spelled backwards), comprised of both Mormons and non ‐ Mormons, to help attend to temporal matters, including the eventual development of a one ‐ world government, in harmony with preparatory plans for the second advent of the Saviour.\" The close relationship between Masonry, the Mormon Priesthood and Joseph Smith's growing ambition to rule the world (in order to bring Christ back) has been pointed out by a number of Mormon writers. Like the Temple ceremonies, the secret Council of Fifty grew out of [Freemasonry]. The Prophet's divine \"revelation about the political kingdom of God\" came just three weeks after the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge was installed and Smith became a Master Mason. These men were all members of the Priesthood, they all wore special robes, and the records of their meetings were often burned (those that remain in the possession of the Church today are not available even for Church historians to peruse). In 1884 Mormon spokesman Elder Lunt said, \"We look forward with perfect confidence to the day when we will hold the reigns of the [United States] government...After that we expect to control the continent.\" This secret organization was referred to in a \"writ issued for the arrest of prominent citizens of Nauvoo for 'treasonable designs against the state.'\" 247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Numerous sources report that shortly before his death Joseph Smith was crowned by the secret council as king over the Mormon kingdom that he believed was destined to control the world. Not only was Joseph Smith crowned \"king on the earth,\" but so were Brigham Young and John Taylor. The authority claimed even today for Mormondom's \"living Prophet\" is still that of an absolute monarch or dictator. One of the greatest authorities on the Mormon doctrine, the late Apostle Bruce R. McConkie has said: \"The church of Jesus Christ of Latter ‐ day Saints as it is now constituted is the kingdom of God on earth...The Church is not a democracy... [but] a kingdom...and the President of the Church, the mouthpiece of God on earth, is the earthly king.\" [William Cooper: I wonder what the Pope has to say about that. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, there is a secret government.] The current importance of all of this ambition to rule the world is evident in the secret oaths still taken by each Mormon going through the Temple ceremonies. [William Cooper: A ceremony, through which Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz has publicly exalted.] In one such oath, the patron \"consecrates\" all he owns, earns and is \"to the church of Jesus Christ of Latter ‐ day Saints for the building up of the kingdom of God on earth and for the establishment of Zion.\" In the \"Law of Sacrifice,\" Template patrons swear even to sacrifice their lives to this cause. This is not what Christians think of as the kingdom of God to be established by Christ Himself, but, as Mormon writer J.D. Williams has pointed out, it involves \"a secret government, responsible not to the governed, but to the ecclesiastical authority, which will provide benign rule for all people, without election.\" That most Mormons are aware of the real purpose behind Mormonism doesn't change the facts. Mormon researcher Klaus Hansen's comments are of interest: \"Even among the Mormons, few were themselves aware of the revolutionary implications inherent in the concept of a political kingdom of God as taught by their prophet Joseph Smith to a small group of faithful followers, after he had initiated them in to a secret Council of Fifty in the spring of 1844...Indeed, if few Mormons, in 1844, knew what kind of kingdom their prophet had organized that year, fewer know today.\" The fact that so few Mormons themselves, to say nothing of non ‐ Mormons, know the truth about Mormonism today reflects the secrecy involved and the apparent intention of its leaders. Is so much of Mormonism plotted and practiced in secret because The Brethren know it can only be \"sold\" under false labels? Can Mormons reasonably expect the world to convert to a religion that is so dishonestly and secretly presented and much of it held back in secret because it is so \"sacred\"? If Mormons are indeed \"the only true Christians,\" then let them emulate the founder of Christianity who said, \"I spake openly to the world...and in secret have I said nothing.\" [The] corruption [is, of course, as always] rooted in power. History confirms common sense and bearing witness that whenever the absolute control which The Brethren wield has rested for very long in human hands, the results have been tragic. The Bible declares that the heart of every human is \"deceitful above all things, and [is] desperately wicked...\" This applies to The Brethren as well as to everyone else. The worst despots in history have been those who claimed to be divine. [And] this is because humans were never intended to exercise godlike power and control either over themselves or over others. [William Cooper: Man is inherently flawed. The concept that imperfect man can rule imperfect man in a thousand years of Utopian peace on this earth is ludicrous.] When they attempt it, disaster results as surely as night follows day. Much of the dishonest unwillingness to face facts unfavorable to their religion and the gullible willingness to believe the most outrageous lies that Mormons themselves admit is endemic among them can be traced to their belief that they are in the processes of becoming \"gods.\" [William Cooper: You see, they are just another branch of Mystery Babylon.] How can a \"god\" ever be wrong? Surely, the temptation to live by the adage \"The end justifies the means\" would be overpowering for anyone who really believes that his \"end\" will be the \"exaltation\" to \"godhood.\" Under the grandiose dream that they are the God Makers, Mormonism's leaders have developed an utter contempt for truth when it conflicts with their goal of extending the Mormon kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ, to encompass the entire world. As the absolute leaders of Mormonism, The Brethren have rewritten [the book of] \"revelations,\" suppressed facts, promoted fraud, honored false prophets, misrepresented their true beliefs and practices, and pretended to [possess] a divine authority, which they obviously do not have, in order to control those under them and ensnare fresh millions in Mormonism. Though their religious zeal may be genuine, they have divorced their faith from truth and built an earthly empire upon the insistence that their followers dare not think for themselves or examine facts, but must blindly obey whatever The Brethren decree. [And this brings up] some extremely grave questions. Mormonism seems as American as apple pie, and Mormons seem to be the 248"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"perfect citizens with their close families, high morals, patriotism, Boy Scout programs, Tabernacle Choir, and conservative politics. A Los Angeles Times article implied that Mormons have recently gained the image of \"super ‐ Americans...[who] appear to many to be 'more American than the average American.'\" [William Cooper: Make no mind that the L.A. Times is mostly owned by the Mormon church.] This may explain why such a high proportion of Mormons find their way into government. Returned LDS missionaries have \"the three qualities the [Central Intelligence Agency] wants: foreign language ability, training in a foreign country and former residence in a foreign country.\" Utah (and particularly [Brigham Young University]) is one of the prime recruiting areas for the [Central Intelligence Agency]. According to [Brigham Young University's] spokesman Dr. Gary Williams, \"We've never had any trouble placing anyone who has applied to the [Central Intelligence Agency]. Every year they take almost anybody who applies.\" He also admitted that this has created problems with a number of foreign countries, who have complained about the \"pretty good dose of [Mormon] missionaries who have gone back to the countries they were in as Central Intelligence agents.\" This may at least partially explain the reported close tie between the Mormon church and the CIA. A disproportionate number of Mormons arrive at the higher levels of the CIA, FBI, military intelligence, armed forces and all levels of city, state and federal governments, including the Senate, Congress, Cabinet and White House Staff. Sincere and loyal citizens, most of them may be unaware of the secret ambition of The Brethren. What could be better than having such patriots as these serving in strategic areas of government and national security? Unfortunately, [dear listeners,] as we have noticed in every other area of Mormonism, the real truth lies hidden beneath the seemingly ideal image of patriotism presented by Mormons in public service. Take, for instance, Bobo [sic] Gritz. In fact, their very presence in responsible government positions, particularly in agencies dealing with national security, raises some extremely grave questions that were expressed by Ed Decker in the following letter mailed to the addressees: An open letter to: The President, First Presidency and members of the General Authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter ‐ day Saints August 21, 1980 Gentlemen: I was recently reflecting that although the actual blood oaths and the oath of vengeance were removed from the Temple ceremonies sometime after 1930, you gentlemen [listing ten of the above] are of an age to have received your own endowments prior to their removal, and therefore, are still under these oaths. I am particularly interested in your personal position on your oath of vengeance against the United States of America. As you recall, the oath was basically as follows: “You and each of you do solemnly promise and vow that you will pray and never cease to importune high heaven to AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE PROPHETS (Joseph and Hiram Smith) ON THIS NATION, and that you will teach this to your children and your children's children unto the third and fourth generation.” Have you officially renounced this oath? Or are you still bound by it? If you have not renounced it, how can you presume to lead four ‐ and ‐ one ‐ half [now over six and a half million Americans] million people [US citizens] under item 12 of your Articles of Faith and still be bound to call upon heaven to heap curses upon our nation? (\"We believe in being subject to Kings, Presidents, Rulers and Magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\") [William Cooper: And that's a quote directly from item 12 of the Articles of Faith.] If you have renounced it, how can you justify having sworn such an oath in 249"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the most holy of holy places on this earth, before the sacred altar of your omnipotent God, and then renounce it? Gentlemen, I call upon you to repent of this abomination and proclaim to both the Mormon people and to the people of the United States of America that you renounce that oath and all it represents. I also call upon all members of the Mormon Church who hold office in our government, serve in the Armed Services, work for the FBI and CIA who have gone through the Mormon Temple and sworn oaths of obedience and sacrifice to the church and its leaders (above), to repent of these oaths in the light of the obvious conflict [*Note: Here, the audio is cut ‐ off, but the rest of the letter is as follows:] of interest between their pledge of allegiance to the USA and their higher loyalty to a [*Note: audio is now resumed:] group of men who are sworn to seek vengeance against this great nation. Sincerely, (Signed) J. Edward Decker [William Cooper: He sent a copy to President Jimmy Carter and Mr. Ronald Reagan.] No response[, ladies and gentlemen, no response] was [ever] received to this letter. The Brethren are so powerful that they are immune to criticism and feel no need to explain themselves or account to anyone for their actions. [William Cooper: And this seems to be the same, the same feeling of Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz, who attacked me physically in Salt Lake City at the Salt Dome and yelled at the top of his voice, \"You will not criticize me, Cooper!\" And I say, Bobo Gritz, you can stick it where the sun doesn't shine.] The Mormon church already packs a political punch far out of proportion to its size. [Recently,] The Wall Street Journal explained how, in spite of the Constitutional separation between Church and State, public schools in Utah are used to instill Mormonism in young minds. [William Cooper: You see, in the state of Utah, it is already a theocracy.] It mentioned political reapportionment, airline deregulation, the basing of the MX missile, and the ERA as [recent] political issues affected by the power of the Church. For example, when the Church opposed the MX missile for Utah, those plans were immediately dropped by the federal government. The same Wall Street Journal article quoted the following statement from J.D. Williams, a University of Utah political science professor: \"There is a disquieting statement in Mormonism. 'When the leaders have spoken, the thinking has been done.' To me, democracy cannot thrive in that climate. They don't have to be called to Church headquarters for political instruction. They know what they're supposed to do. That's why non ‐ Mormons can only look toward the Mormon church and wonder: 'What is Big Brother doing to me today?'\" [William Cooper: But, ladies and gentlemen, there is a more disturbing possibility.] While the election of a Mormon...President seems unlikely, it is highly probable under the present swing toward conventional morality and conservatism that a Mormon could one day become a Republican Vice ‐ Presidential nominee. This is especially true when one considers the growing cooperation between Mormons and the Moral Majority. With the power, wealth, wide influence, numerous highly placed Mormons, and large voting block under their virtual control, The Brethren have a great deal to offer a Republican Presidential candidate. Let's assume that a Mormon Vice ‐ Presidential candidate is on the winning ticket, and thereafter the President dies in office or is assassinated, causing the Mormon to succeed him as President of the United States. [William Cooper: And we know that The Order assassinated John F. Kennedy in the outdoor Temple of the Sun known as Dealey Plaza. We also know that the clamor for a savior in the United States of America is reaching unprecedented proportions and many are looking, many are looking to H. Ross Perot, who will cast around and maybe, maybe choose someone like Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz as his vice presidential running mate. Or is it possible that Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz could himself be elected to the presidency of the United States of America in this climate of absolute chaos, which The Order, the Illuminati has created with the help of people like Tom Valentine and organizations like the Liberty Lobby? Is this a possibility? Are you listening to me, sheeple?] There is every reason to believe that the new President would immediately begin to gather around him increasing numbers of zealous Temple Mormons in strategic places at the highest levels of government. A crisis similar to the one which Mormon prophecies \"foretold\" occurs, in which millions of Mormons with their year's supply of food, guns, and ammunition play a key role. It would be a time of excitement and zealous effort by the \"Saints\" to fulfill Joseph Smith's and Brigham Young's \"prophecy\": 250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"\"The time will come when the destiny of the nation will hang upon a single thread. At that critical juncture, this people will step forth and save it from the threatened destruction.\" Not only does Mormonism predict the \"saving\" of America, but the precedent for an attempted takeover by force of subterfuge through political means has been set by the founding \"Prophet\" himself. In 1834 Joseph Smith organized an army and marched toward Independence, Missouri to \"redeem Zion.\" In spite of a humiliating surrender to the Missouri militia that proved his bold \"prophecies\" false, [and therefore, that he could not possibly be a real prophet as the Mormon church proclaims, ignoring that a \"Prophet\" cannot possibly be wrong,] the \"Prophet\" later formed the \"Nauvoo Legion\" and commissioned himself a lieutenant ‐ general to command it. Lyman L. Woods stated: \"I have seen him on a white horse wearing the uniform of a general...He was leading a parade of the Legion and looked like a god.\" Joseph Smith was not only ordained king on earth, but he ran for President of the United States just before his death, at which time Mormon missionaries across the country became \"a vast force of political [power].\" Today's Church leaders are urging Mormons to prepare themselves for the coming crisis in order to succeed where past \"Saints\" have failed. A recent major article in Ensign about being prepared included this oft ‐ repeated warning reminder: \"The commandment to re ‐ establish Zion became for the saints of Joseph Smith's day the central goal of the Church. But it was a goal the Church did not realize because its people were not fully prepared.\" [Going back, ladies and gentlemen,] going back to our hypothetical crisis, what Mormons [attempted] unsuccessfully...against impossible odds in the past they might very well have accomplished with much better odds in this future scenario. [William Cooper: They are building a hero, a demagogue, someone who can well become a vice president and will, in fact, be a presidential candidate, Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz.] [And] under cover of the national and international crisis, the Mormon President of the United States acts boldly and decisively to assume dictatorial powers. With the help of The Brethren and Mormons everywhere, he appears to save America and becomes a national hero. At this time, he is made Prophet and president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter ‐ day Saints and the Mormon kingdom of God, while still President of the United States. [Ladies and gentlemen,] there is no provision in the Constitution to prevent this. With the government largely in the hands of increasing numbers of Mormon appointees at all levels throughout the United States, the Constitutional prohibition against the establishment of a state church would no longer be enforceable. Mormon prophecies and the curse upon which the United States government in revenge for the blood of Joseph and Hyram Smith would seemingly have been fulfilled. In effect, the United States would have become a theocracy exactly as planned by the Brethren, completing the first step in the Mormon takeover of the world. President John Taylor boasted of it 100 years ago[. He said]: \"Let us now notice our political position in the world. What are we going to do? We are going to possess the earth...and reign over it forever and ever.\" [William Cooper: Of course, he was speaking for the collective secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati.] \"Now, ye Kings and Emperors help yourselves if you can. This is the truth and it may as well be told at this time as at any other. There's a good time coming, Saints, a good time coming!\" [William Cooper: But there is a more likely scenario.] While the [beginning and meat of this program presents a] disturbing possibility, it may seem highly speculative and improbable. There is another scenario, however, which is equally disturbing[, but is] much more likely. [William Cooper: And if you've been listening to our series on the Mysteries, you will understand it immediately.] It arises from the fact that Mormonism is actually part of something [much,] much larger. We have already noted that the \"revelations\" that Joseph Smith received, far from being unique, were in fact very similar[, if not identical,] to the basic philosophy underlying many occult groups and secret revolutionary societies. Thus far in history, these numerous occult/revolutionary organizations have remained largely separate and in competition with one another. If something should happen to unite them, [dear listeners,] and at the same time their beliefs should gain worldwide acceptance, [as in 251"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"the New Age movement,] a new and unimaginably powerful force for world revolution would have come into existence. There is[, in fact,] increasing evidence of a new and growing secular/religious ecumenicism [pervasive and] persuasive enough to accomplish this unprecedented and incalculable powerful coalition. It could be the means of creating the one ‐ world government that has not only been the long ‐ standing hope and plan of The Brethren and many other occult/revolutionary leaders in [Freemasonry and other secret organizations, supposedly existing for the good of the community], but is increasingly gaining a wide acceptance through New Age networks as the only viable option to a nuclear holocaust and our ecological collapse. Improbable? Perhaps[, dear listeners]. But certainly it can no longer be summarily dismissed as impossible. ===================================================== (end of quote) After listening to this broadcast, you should have a much clearer understanding of the world, of the Mormon church, of what's happening in the United States, of the many different organizations, veiled, where behind this veil those who consider themselves to be illumined continue to work toward their great dream of an earthly Utopia which they call The Plan, The Great Society, The Great Work. It has been their dream for millennia. It is nothing new as those of you who have listened to the entire series that we have done on the Hour of the Time, known as the Mystery Schools, or Mystery Babylon have discovered. Now, please understand that we are discussing the hierarchy of the Mormon Church, not Mormons. I know many Mormons who are good, upstanding patriot citizens of this country. They have no knowledge of this. In fact, as the members of every other church of every other religion practiced on this earth, they believe mostly through blind faith and never question. They do not know the basic facts of the truth or falsity of their dogma, nor do they generally care. And even if they knew, which many of them do know and understand, they would not renounce it and walk away for they would be become a pariah in their own society. And in the state of Utah, to renounce the Mormon church, it could be a death sentence. Now, should you think this absolutely absurd, I recently took a trip through the state of Utah. Through the long valley, there is a small city called Orderville. Now, if you know what I know and if you've been listening to this program, you know some of what I know. You know that I would have had to stop to find out why that city was called Orderville. I did, and I was amazed...for it was no secret there that it was the first Communist settlement established in the United States by the Mormon Church. These facts are freely admitted in the city, and in fact they take great pride in the history of their little town. It was the first Communist government, community established by the Mormon Church in their search, in their search for their promised land, which eventually became Salt Lake City. It was established and named after a secret organization known as The Order, to which the elders of the community belonged. You can even see it, the history, the same history that I have just given to you, on the signs at the rest stops entering and leaving the town. You can get more of the history by visiting the small historical society in Orderville. It is a fact. And now, ladies and gentlemen, remember this. This program did not just come from my research, or the research of CAJI, although our research follows what you have heard tonight, letter for letter and word for word. But so that you would understand that I am not crazy, tonight's program was taken from chapter sixteen of a book which you can purchase yourself or order from your bookstore. The name of this book is The Godmakers . The Godmakers , written by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt. It is called The Godmakers, it is written by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt. Tonight's program came from chapter sixteen. It's published by Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, Oregon, 97402. That's The Godmakers , written by Ed Decker and Dave Hunt, published by Harvest House Publishers, Eugene, Oregon, 97402. I recommend that you get this book and read it cover to cover, and understand that the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence, and me personally in my own research, have confirmed every single word in this book. It is fact. As for Bobo Gritz, we here at CAJI and the Hour of the Time have already proven to you, in his own words, that he is a liar. And we have many tapes that we have not played and we will continue to do so until you, the sheeple, wake up. In the symbology of the temples of Freemasonry, the Mormon church and all along the highways in the state of Utah, you can see one of the most common symbols of that secret organization which we know, collectively, as the Illuminati. Ladies and gentleman, that is the beehive. Good night, and God bless you all.

Once again, you’re listening to the Hour of the Time. I’m William Cooper. (William Cooper announces an upcoming appearance in San Francisco) Well, folks, tonight is going to be illuminating, I can tell you that for sure. Let me tell you first, right off the bat, before we get into the subject of tonight’s broadcast. (William Cooper talks about a plan to purchase large quantities of voting stock for GCI (Gannett Co., Inc.)) OK, folks, make sure that you’re in a chair, you're comfortable; that you got your mind open, you got a pad of paper and a pencil by your side, because we're going to spread some light in some dark corners. (opening music: Amazing Grace , sung by Aaron Neville) Visitors to New York City who venture into the large building known as the United Nations are amazed to find that there is a Meditation Room. [reading from The Cult of the All ‐ Seeing Eye , written by Robert Spenser] (start of quote) =================================================================== The Meditation Room[, ladies and gentlemen,] is thirty feet long, eighteen feet wide at the entrance (which faces north north ‐ east), and nine feet wide at the other end. It is therefore wedge ‐ shaped. Its only entrance is through two tinted glass ‐ paned doors outside of which stands a United Nations guard. Inside the room is another guard. Once through the doors, the visitor finds himself in a darkened corridor which leads to the left. The sharp transition from the world of light to one of extreme darkness forces a feeling of abrupt withdraw from the outside world upon the senses of the visitor who walks along the corridor, reaches the inner arched entrance, turns right, and then looks into the room. The room is very dimly lit. The only source of light, at first glance, is that which is reflected squarely from the gleaming upper surface of the brooding, somber altar in the center of the room. A special lens recessed in the ceiling focuses a beam of light on the altar from a point above and just beyond its far edge. Thin lines of bluish light lap the edges of the shadow cast by the altar. The acoustical properties of the room are unique. The edges of padding material behind the paneling on the walls can be detected at the ceiling level. This absorbs sound as does the Swedish ‐ woven blue rug which covers the floor of the corridor in the back of the room. The room is as quiet as an underground tomb. Its floors paved with blue ‐ grey slate slabs laid in a haphazard pattern. At the edge of the rug 253"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"are two very low railings extending out from the east and west walls of the room. The center space between the railings is some six feet in width. To the right of the inner entrance are ten low wicker benches arranged in two rows of three and one back row of four against the corridor wall. Attempts by visitors to pass the railings are discouraged by the guard. The mural is a fresco which was painted originally on wet plaster one section at a time by the artist with the aid of an expert in this work brought from Europe. It is set into a steel ‐ framed narrow panel projected from the wall, behind which is an enclosed area some six inches deep which has its own light source. A small, square projector set close against the front base of the altar throws a diffused beam of light from a recessed aperture upon the surface of the mural. There are also ten hidden lights, five on each side of the room, behind the upper edges of a thin suspended ceiling which extends out over the room from the top of the mural. The eighteen ‐ inch space between the two ceilings contains the light control apparatuses. The lower ceiling is wedge ‐ shaped and separated from three walls of the inner room by a foot ‐ wide space. Thus the room appears[, appears,] to be much longer than it really is because of the many converging lines leading into the narrow end, the corners of which are rounded off on either side of the mural. The altar is four feet high, and rests on two narrow cross pieces. It is a dark gray block of crystalline iron ore from a Swedish mine and weighs six and one ‐ half tons. The Swedish government presented this block of iron ore ‐‐ the largest of its kind ever mined ‐‐ to the [United Nations] in early 1957. \"The chunk rests on a concrete pillar that goes straight down to bed ‐ rock.\" The area and passageway beneath the room are closed to the public. The chunk of ore has been described as a lodestone, or magnetite, which is strongly magnetic and which posses polarity. \"In northern Sweden are what may be the largest magnetite deposits in the world, believed to have been formed by segregation in the magma.\" Magma is the term for molten material held in solution under the pressure of the earth’s crust. The fresco mural was described in the [United Nations] Review of January 1958 as having been designed \"to conform with the purity of line and color sought, for what Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld has called 'a room of stillness'.\" It was painted predominantly in shades of grays and blues, but includes yellow and white patterns and a black half ‐ sphere. Light pure colors intersect to form deeper shades. The New York Times described the fresco as being eight feet eight inches in height and six feet eight inches in width; more brightly illuminated at the top than at the bottom. Bo Beskow, an old friend of Dag Hammarskjöld, painted the mural. \"Dag had me start sketches on this last summer,\" he said. \"He wanted me to do the actual work right here in the room, so I have been here since October [6th, 1957].\" The mural was seen for the first time[, ladies and gentlemen,] on November [the 11th], 1957. During the period of the remodeling the guards were on hand during the day to keep out the curious and at night the room was locked up with a chain and padlock. The artist has said of his work: \"It has no title, and you can make what you wish of it.\" He explained that the geometric patterns in the mural repeated the proportions of the room and those of the focal point of the room, the piece of iron ore. He also said that he intended to give a feeling of space with the picture. The [United Nations] Review story stated that \"he sought to open up the room so that the eye can travel in the distance when it strikes the wall. To give a slight upward movement, he said he designed winding circles and a spiraling diagonal line which might be compared to a vibrating musical chord. As a 'resting spot' for the viewer's eyes, he provided one spot of black amid the light colors, a half circle at which all lines of the fresco and the room converge.\" In the New Yorker story cited earlier, Beskow was quoted as saying: \"My fresco contained no intentional symbols, though I've heard people say that the black ‐ and ‐ pale ‐ blue circle on the upper middle section of the panel stands for the cosmos. All that I seriously sought to do was to open up the wall, in order to allow the eye to travel farther, and to open up the mind, provoking meditation but not directing it.\" The mystic, P. D. Ouspensky, has written that in \"real art nothing is accidental. It is mathematics. Everything in it can be calculated, everything can be known beforehand. The artist knows and understands what he wants to convey and his work cannot produce one impression on one man and another impression on another, presuming, of course, [they are] people on one level...At the same time the same work of art will produce different impressions on people of different levels. And people from lower levels will never receive from it what people of higher levels receive. This is real objective art...An objective work of art...affects the emotional and not only the intellectual side of man.\" Mr. Beskow’s picture is described as nonobjective, yet its composition admittedly reflects the dimensions of the room and the chunk of iron ore ‐‐ this[, ladies and gentlemen,] involves mathematics. He said of his mural, \"you can make as you wish of it,\" yet he admittedly sought to create a specific subjective effect in the mind of the spectator. Consequently, Mr. Beskow’s remarks create confusion rather than understanding. The leaflet made available to those who visit the Meditation Room was written under the direction of Dag Hammarskjöld [himself]. Its 254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"description of the room is deliberately couched in abstruse language. It contains terms which have meaning to the esoterically inclined but not to the uninitiated [William Cooper: or those called the \"profane\"]. These terms will be explained... [William Cooper: ...and have, in fact, been explained during the Mystery Babylon segments of the Hour of the Time, but for those who may be just beginning to listen to this program, esoteric means, \"that which is hidden,\" and is kept only for the initiated, those who have studied the Mysteries. The profane, ladies and gentlemen, is you. I leave myself out because, during the process of studying the Mysteries, I...I, with great irony, have become illumined. And if you continue to listen to the Hour of the Time, so shall you.] The leaflet reads: \"We all have within us a center of stillness surrounded by silence...People of many faiths will meet here, and for that reason none of the symbols to which we are accustomed to in our meditation could be used. \"However, there are simple things which speak to us all with the same language. We have sought for such things and we believe we have found them in the shaft of light striking the shimmering surface of solid rock. \"So, in the middle of the room we see a symbol of how, daily, the light of the skies gives [light]...life to the earth on which we stand, a symbol to many of us of how the life of the spirit gives life to matter. \"But the stone in the middle of the room has more to tell us. We may see it as an altar, empty not because there is no God, not because it is an altar to an unknown god, but because it is dedicated to the God whom man worships under many names and in many forms. \"The stone in the middle of the room reminds us also of the firm and permanent in a world of movement and change. The block of iron ore has the weight and solidity of the everlasting. It is a reminder of that cornerstone of endurance and faith on which all human Endeavor must be based. \"The material of the stone leads our thoughts to the necessity for choice between destruction and peace. Of iron man has forged his swords, of iron he has also made his ploughshares... \"The shaft of light strikes the stone in a room of utter simplicity...When our eyes travel from these symbols to the front wall, they meet a simple pattern opening up the room to the harmony, freedom and balance of space. \"There is an ancient [Chinese] saying that the sense of a vessel is not in its shell but in the void. So it is with this room. It is for those who come here to fill the void with what they find in their center of stillness.\" The World Goodwill Bulletin is published by Lucis Press, Ltd. (owned by Lucis Trust) at 88 Edgeware Rd., Marble Arch, London W ‐ 2, England. The New York branch, The Lucis Publishing Company (11 W. 42nd St., 32nd floor), issues materials on its Arcane School, three ‐ member Triangles, and World Service Fund, and publishes the Beacon Magazine . This company[, ladies and gentlemen,] was originally established as the Lucifer Publishing Co., but changed its name on November [the 11th], 1924, to the less startling one it bears today. A third branch of the Lucis Trust is located at 1 Rue de Varembe (3E), Geneva, Switzerland. Alice A. Bailey, the now deceased High Priestess of the occult Arcane School, established and headed the Trust and its self ‐ identified society of Illumined Minds. This powerful group has intimate connections with the United Nations. [The Goodwill...] The World Goodwill Bulletin issued a special edition on the United Nations in July, 1957, which contained an article entitled \"Lodestone.\" We quote from its description of the Meditation Room: \"The visitor will be totally unprepared for what he will see as he steps in the door for a moment of quiet...Because of the converging walls and the dim light, he will experience a peculiar spatial disorientation, and dimension and perspective will seem difficult to establish. In the center of the room, he will see, illuminated by a single point of light from the ceiling, a rectangular mass... \"The ore piece...is many millions of years old...one feels...as though one is in a repository for some natural talisman of significant and noble importance, rather than in a chapel in an ordinary sense...Those who are wedded to seeking communion in traditional settings may be somewhat ill at ease here. This is a sudden break with prior experience. One is thrown violently upon his [own] resources. \"The room and the concept do not seem indicative of the supplications or the dualistic concept of the mystic in which illumination is sought and is a boon granted by Deity. Rather, seemingly inherent in the decoration of the room, in the pinpoint of light playing on the ore, is the concept of a personal concentration of forces, creating a focus that illumines the field of attention... \"The pinpoint of light, the void of space, the illuminated crystalline ore ‐‐ one feels projected into a setting of cosmological symbolism rather than one of planetary or even solar intent. 255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"\"It is interesting to speculate on what the long ‐ term influence of this 'new departure' will be on current religious thinking. Ensconced here in the highest Hall of Man, it cannot be inconsiderable. Whatever interpretations one may attribute to the United Nations Meditation Room, it can be said with certainty that the words and the repercussions have only just begun.\" [Folks,] the 'new departure' in religion referred to did not occur by chance. \"Tremendous pressure was brought to bear on Trygve Lie and Dag Hammarskjöld to install such a room at the [United Nations] by such organizations as the World Council of Churches.\" Trygve Lie announced on April [18th], 1949 that such a room would be established. The 5th General Assembly opened with one minute of silence as a 'religious' observance. Shortly thereafter a temporary meditation room was provided at Lake Success, New York. On February [9th], 1951, a meditation room was opened for one day at the [United Nations] Secretariat building. [Then,] on October [14th] 1952, the opening day of the 7th General Assembly, a permanent Meditation Room was made available to the public. Since then each Assembly has opened with one minute of silence. In 1955 the Meditation Room contained a 300 ‐ year ‐ old, 800 ‐ pound, 37 ‐ inch wide upright section of an agba ([or] mahogany) tree from French Equatorial Africa. It was the idea of Wallace Harrison, director of the international board of architects which planned the [United Nations]; co ‐ architect and director of Rockefeller Center; and member of the board of directors of the socialist New School of Social Research in New York City. (See Who’s Who in America [for 1959 for reference.]) The room contained a philodendron plant on the altar, to symbolize some unknown person killed in a war; an olive green rug, twenty ‐ five russet colored chairs; and a blue and white [United Nations] banner set in front of a ceiling ‐ to ‐ floor white drape. On February 16th, 1953, a group known as the Friends of the Meditation Room, numbering 1500 members, presented through its officers a set of guest books to the [United Nations] wherein visitors to the room could inscribe their names, addresses and religious affiliations. [Since then, many, many millions] have been estimated by the [United Nations to have entered the room...of these visitors... [of these visitors, millions] have signed...these books, each containing seven thousand names. What purpose[, ladies and gentlemen,] is served by the accumulation of these thousands of names of individuals, with their religious affiliations, who visit the room and who ‐‐ by the act of signing their names ‐‐ indicate that they do not object to the existence of this pagan temple? The Friends are the product of the \"non ‐ sectarian\" Laymen’s Movement for a Christian World, Inc., the international headquarters of which is located at Wainwright House, Milton Point, Rye, New York. Warren R. Austin, a past permanent [United States] delegate to the [United Nations], headed a Friend's committee which presented $12,600 to [Dag] Hammarskjöld on April [24th], 1957, as first payment on $25,000 needed to remodel and enlarge the room. The Movement has issued \"[United Nations Mediation Room Identification Cards [to] 300 men and women who go periodically to this room for prayer.\" It once issued Prayer Cards to visitors containing prayers from the \"World's Great Living Religions,\" namely, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islamism, Sikhism, Christianity and Saint Francis of Assisi. [William Cooper: I was not aware that Saint Francis of Assisi was one of the world's great religions, were you?] The Friends held Vigils of Prayer in the room in 1953 and 1954. Back in 1946 the Movement had sent Dr. Frank Laubach, Union Theological Seminary graduate and author of \"Letters of a Modern Mystic,\" to the Paris Peace Conference to lobby for the establishment of the Meditation Room. Speakers for the Movement's meetings have included Norman Cousins, Ralph Bunche, and Frank P. Graham of the [United Nations], and William Ernest Hocking and Kirtley F. Mather of Harvard, all of whom have communist ‐ front records (see the May ‐ June and July ‐ August 1959 and July ‐ August 1962 issues of The Laymen’s Movement Review .) The Movement has included among its members Dwight David Eisenhower...The most important Friend of the Movement from its inception, however, has been John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A Methodist missionary, Weyman C. Huckabee, secured and received grants from John D. Rockefeller, Jr.’s Davison Fund and from his (New York City) Riverside Church funds for five consecutive years (1937 ‐ 41), for a health center in Hiroshima, Japan...Huckabee then became the secretary of the Movement in New York in 1941 and secured two grants a year for the organization from the Davidson Fund until it was liquidated. [William Cooper: It is not coincidence, ladies and gentlemen, that the funds...] [audio break ‐ silence] 256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"...John D.

During the twenty ‐ two years Huckabee remained with the Movement a million dollars was raised for its work. When the Movement first sought to secure Wainwright House for its headquarters in 1951, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. gave $5,000 of the [$25,000] needed. Since 1951, ten thousand individuals have signed the guest book of Wainwright House; five thousand have attended its public meetings; its members have been addressed by the President of the National Council of Churches...its conference rooms have been used by the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Congregationalists and Quaker churches. When the Friends of the Meditation Room agreed to raise $15,000 to pay for the redecoration of the room, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. gave $5,000 of the amount sought...Dag Hammarskjöld personally raised another $10,000 from the Marshall Field family for the cost of the fresco in the Room...The United Steel Workers, CIO ‐ AFL, gave $500. The Movement was formed[, ladies and gentlemen,] in 1940. The man who started it was Dr. Arthur Compton, the scientist who first brought the identified Communist and accused [espionage agent] [*note, WC incorrectly says \"agent espionage\"] Professor J. Robert Oppenheimer, into the Atomic Energy Project in 1942. Wainwright House has its own Meditation Room, on its second floor. The room contains the agba wood altar first used in the U.N. Meditation Room, and the cherry wood chairs and drapes from that room, presented to the Friends by the [United Nations] in 1957. The House also contains a large library centered around the Thomas Sugrue Memorial Library, a sixteen hundred dollar collection of books on religion and occultism ‐‐ where one may read up on spiritualism, Zen, Taoism, Yoga, Judaism, etc. Every book in the library has a bookplate therein designed by the artist, Fritz Eichenberg. His bookplate \"depicts the ancient cross in the shape of a T, surrounded by a serpent symbolizing wisdom and healing, and forming the letter S. The T and S, Thomas Sugrue's initials, are crowned by the lotus, Vedantic representation of all being. In the background lies the city of Jerusalem, over which shine two stars, the star of the East of Christianity and six ‐ pointed star of Judaism. A flame spreads an arc of light above, proclaiming the continuity of life and the immortality of the soul.\" M. Oldfield Howey tells us in The Encircled Serpent that in the symbolism of Egypt the \"serpent is constantly represented as surmounting a cross...the Brazen Serpent...was a palladium, or talisman, in the form of a serpent coiled around the mystic Tau, or T. The serpent set up by Moses was originally the Egyptian...Sun ‐ God, who was now known to his people as Jehovah.\" Joseph Von Hammer, in The History of the Assassins , explains the tau as the figure of the phallus. \"Among the Egyptians, the lotus was the symbol of Osiris and Isis. It was esteemed a sacred ornament by the priests.\" The six ‐ pointed star is the great Oriental talisman known as the Seal of Solomon. Its meaning[, its meaning, ladies and gentlemen,] and the identity of Osiris and Isis has already been explained in [past episodes of the Hour of the Time. It will also be explained on a later edition of the Hour of the Time when we discuss the Great seal of the United States of America.] The arc of light on the bookplate is the En Soph, from the Cabalistic writings ([or] mystical theosophy) which teach that it created the world by virtue of ten emanations from the Infinite One. The emanations, or Sephiroth, or are arranged into a form called the Tree of Life, which in turn is vertically composed of three pillars. C.W. King, in his Gnostics , states that the two outer pillars \"figure largely amongst all the secret societies of modern times, and naturally so; for these illuminati have borrowed, without understanding it, the phraseology of the Cabalists. Dag Hammarskjöld called the altar a reminder of that \"cornerstone...on which all human endeavor must be based.\" The Meditation Room faces north north ‐ east. To enter the room one must proceed from darkness to light[...from darkness to light]. With these facts in mind note the cabalistic symbolism of the following description of the cornerstone by an authority: \"In its situation, it lies between the north, the place of darkness, and the east, the place of light; and hence this position symbolizes...progress from darkness to light, and from ignorance to knowledge. The permanence and durability of the corner ‐ stone...is intended [to remind us that long after our death we have within ourselves] a sure foundation of eternal life ‐‐ a corner ‐ stone of immortality ‐‐ an emanation...which pervades all nature, and which, therefore, must [must] survive the tomb.\" On a \"higher\" level of \"esoteric knowledge\" the metal altar or stone can be likened to the ancient Stone of Foundation, which, according to the same authority cited above, was supposed \"to have been...placed at one time within the foundations of the Temple of Solomon, and afterwards, during the building of the second Temple, transported to the Holy of Holies. It was in the form of a perfect cube, [or, as the Freemasons call it, Ashlar,] and had inscribed upon its upper face, within a delta or triangle, the sacred Tetragrammaton or ineffable name of God.\" 257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"In a \"scurrilous book of the Middle Ages...the Life of Jesus\" there was another account of the stone: \"At that time there was in the Temple the ineffable name of God inscribed upon the Stone of Foundation.\" This scandalous book preceded to state that Our Saviour \"cunningly obtained a knowledge of the Tetragrammaton from the Stone of Foundation, and by its mystical influence was enabled to perform his miracles...there was a very general prevalence among the early nations of antiquity of the worship of stones as the representative of Deity...\" [William Cooper: ...and in England the Queen sits upon a throne, under which is a stone. This happens in almost every ancient temple, and...] \"...in every ancient temple there was a legend of a sacred or mystical stone...the mystical stone there has received the name of the 'Stone of Foundation.'\" (\"'And the scribes who had come down out of Jerusalem said, \"He has Beelzebub,\" and, \"By the prince of devils he casts out devils.\"') Alfred Edward Waite, in his study of the Zohar (the cabalistic textbook of the 14th century), entitled The Secret Doctrine of Israel ...wrote ([on page] 62) of \"a mysterious stone called Schethiya\" which was cast by Jehovah \"into the abyss, so to form the basis of the world and give birth thereto. One might say otherwise that it was like a cubical stone or altar, for its extremity was concealed in the depth, while its surface or summit arose above the chaos. It was the central point in the immensity of the world, the cornerstone, the tried stone, the sure foundation, but also that stone which the builders rejected.\" [William Cooper: And where have we heard that before? Well, folks, nowhere else but in the teachings of Freemasonry.] But what, really, in the Christian meaning is the cornerstone? Isaiah said: \"Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a stone in the foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten.\" The corner stone is Jesus Christ, \"the stone that the builders rejected.\" One need go no further than the inner entrance of the Meditation Room to see concrete evidence of the Godlessness of the [United Nations]. [That word sticks in my throat: \"Godlessness.\"] The \"stone,\" the metal altar, in its stark setting in that Room is in itself a symbol of idolatry. \"Stone worship was perhaps the earliest form of Fetishism...Eusebius cites Porphyry as saying the ancients represented the Deity by a black stone, because his nature is obscure and inscrutable. The reader here will be reminded of the black stone, Hadjar el Aswad, based in the southwest corner of the Kaaba at Mecca, which was worshiped by the ancient Arabians...The Druids, it is well known, had no other images of their gods but cubicle or sometimes columnar stones...to use the language of Dudley, the pillar or stone 'was adapted as a symbol of strength and firmness ‐‐ a symbol, also, of the divine power, and, by ready inference, a symbol or idol of the Deity himself'...the god Hermes [Mercury] was represented without hands or feet, being a cubicle stone, because the cubicle figure betokened his solidity and stability.\" Hammarskjöld, in the speech quoted earlier, said: \"In this case we wanted this massive 'altar' to give the impression of something more than temporary...We had another idea...we thought we could bless by our thoughts the very material from which arms are made.\" The description of the altar as a \"natural talisman\" by the World Goodwill group also is significant. Talisman is a term which means a stone, or other object, engraven with figures or characters to which is attributed the occult powers of the planetary influences and celestial configurations under which it was made. Altars, \"among the ancients, were generally made of turf or stone...usually in a cubical form. Altars were erected long before temples.\" The shaft of light upon the altar in the Meditation Room casts a shadow to the north. \"The use of the north as a symbol of darkness (is)...a portion of the old sun worship, of which we find so many relics in Gnosticism, in Hermetic philosophy...\" [William Cooper: In Freemasonry, in the temples of all the secret societies which exist in a membership in the shape of a pyramid with a whole bunch of slathering idiots, thirsting after the secrets which they will never know, and a few at the top who really understand that the only secret is how to control those on the bottom.] \"The east was the place of the sun's daily birth, and hence highly revered; the north the place of his annual death.\" Finally, it must be emphasized that above all the altar in the Meditation Room is unsanctified and unhallowed. It has no sacred meaning, can inspire no reverence, and is not inviolable. This altar cannot be used for sacrifice in any other than an unholy sense. [Ladies and gentlemen,] one clue to the mural's symbolism is given in Hammarskjöld's and Beskow's descriptions of its purpose. It was to \"open up the wall, to give a feeling of space, of the void ‐‐ in effect, to extend the room further out, into another dimension as it were.\" The Friends' leaflet, A Call to Prayer , states the theme of the mural is \"infinity.\" [Now] let us look at this mural squarely form the viewpoint of the esoterically inclined, the occultist[, the adept, the initiate]. There is an 258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"asymmetrical arrangement of the entire mural into what is called a \"Magic Square,\" which is a square arranged in an equal number of cells ‐‐ in this case nine ‐‐ three rows up and three rows down. The game tic ‐ tac ‐ toe is based on this kind of square. The talismanic magic square has a series of numbers in the cells, \"the enumeration of all of whose columns, vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, will give the same sum.\" The following nine digits so arranged as to add up to 15 in any direction were regarded as sacred, because 15 is the numerical value of the Hebrew word for God, JAH [spelled J ‐ A ‐ H], which is one of the forms of the Tetragrammaton. [ 4 9 2 ] [ 3 5 7 ] [ 8 1 6 ] [William Cooper: And in the rows going across, from left to right, and in each row: the first row, the numbers are 4, 9 and 2, and in the second row, the numbers are 3, 5 and 7, and in the third row, the numbers are 8, 1 and 6. Whether you add them up diagonally, vertically or horizontally, no matter in which direction you go, it always adds up to the number 15.] The predominantly dark blue rectangle which occupies most of the middle tier of the mural, the upper side which passes through the exact middle of the small bisected sphere, represents the altar. The yellow rectangle set at an angle into the lower and middle tiers so that one corner touches the bottom of the mural is a second representation of the altar. They indicate[, ladies and gentlemen,] duality: [William Cooper: Remember the yin and the yang? Positive/Negative? Male/Female? The androgynous god?] the yellow figure ‐‐ light ([the] sun); the blue figure ‐‐ earth ([the] altar). Both rectangular figures are overlaid in part by other patterns in other colors. The all ‐ important sphere in the left upper middle section symbolizes, among other things, the sun. Sun worship was \"the oldest and by far the most prevalent of all the ancient religions.\" The sphere is bisected and quartered. \"The phenomena of nature that made the deepest religious impression on archaic man [were] the outstretched heavens above him, and the outspread earth beneath; both of which he naturally divided into four quarters...this four ‐ fold heaven and earth he signified by a circle, or a square, divided cross ‐ ways.\" The circle[, ladies and gentlemen,] is met within every form of sorcery. The circle and quadrants is called the Magic Circle. The objects in the Meditation Room are intended to be evocative, in the religious sense. Of what? [Well,] the mural and altar are admittedly symbols. \"By symbolism the simplest, the commonest objects are transformed, idealized, and acquire a new and, so to say, illimitable value.\" An expert on these subjects have written: \"Under occult dominion Art, Music and Politics all tend to the same end: confusion, a calculated and inducted confusion: [chaos] for minds that are confused will obey and bow to the hidden masters!\" [William Cooper: And out of chaos...out of chaos comes order. And isn’t that...isn’t that the motto of the 33rd degree of Freemasonry: Ordo Ad Chao?] \"The rule of the Triangle and the Ellipse, together with a crude Geometry in modern art, is the rule...in esthetics. \"Standing before a meaningless Cubist canvas at an art exhibition one day, a puzzled amateur asked \"But what does it mean?\" To which the painter replied, 'It's not a question of what it means, it’s a question of what is its effect on the observer.' \"Consciously or unconsciously the artist spoke the truth. Psychiatrists tell us that this school of insidious humbug is simply an elaboration of the policy of the interruption of ideas leading to total incoherence and madness. 'Cubist' art in effort to produce certain psychic effects obtainable by optical illusion. Beauty has nothing [nothing] to do with it. The cubist school is not the realm of art at all. It belongs to that of medicine and psychic science. Those who forget that this devastating fad of 'The Interrupted Idea' can be extended to music, literature and every other phase of human effort, do so at their own peril. [William Cooper: For instance, listen closely to the beat of the rap musician.] \"A mind that is positive cannot be controlled. For the purpose of occult dominion minds must therefore be rendered passive and negative in order that control can be conceived. Minds consciously working to a definite end are a power, and power can oppose power for good or for evil. The scheme for world dominion might be doomed by recognition of this principle alone, but, as it is unfortunately recognized, it remains unchallenged.\" [William Cooper: Until we decided to purchase a media corporation, and thus now, now we have minds consciously working to a definite end, and we are now a power...a very great power.] A striking feature of the mural is the white half ‐ crescent in its upper right quadrant. The inner curve of the crescent ‐‐ closest to the bisected black, pale blue and yellow sphere ‐‐ is equidistant at all points from the exact center of the bisected figure. Therefore[, ladies and gentlemen,] if the curve of the crescent is continued full ‐ circle, the figure which results is a hidden point with in a circle, the symbol 259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"which was adopted by the astronomers as their sign of the sun. [William Cooper: And, of course, you know that the crescent is the sign of the moon, Isis and Osiris.] In the Ancient Mysteries the point in the circle denoted the principle of fecundity and has been carried down through the ages as a sign of various secret societies, including the Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt in 1776. [William Cooper: And you will find the dot in a circle in the temples of Freemasonry. It is the symbol of the phallus. We always come back to the generative force.] The female principle is also emphasized in the crescent moon or lunette figure [of Isis]. There are 72 geometrical figures (and shadings) in the mural. The two crescent shapes and the four long triangles ‐‐ white, yellow, blue and black ‐‐ which are located in the two upper tiers of the mural, are each counted as one figure. The number 72 denoted from the earliest days the Divine Name of 72 words[, 72 words]. This number is derived from a permutation of the values assigned to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton ([or] JHVH: Jehovah), the Ineffable, Unpronounceable Name of God. This Name, in its multitude of forms, can be used to work miracles or magic, so say the Cabalists. It was derived from Exodus[, chapter 14, verses 19, 20 and 21], which each consist of 72 letters. \"Now, if these three verses be written at length one above another, first from right to left, second from left to right, and the third from right to left (or, as the Greeks would say, boustrophedon), they will give 72 columns of three letters each. Then each column will be a word of three letters, and as there are 72 columns, there will be 72 words of three letters, each of which will be the 72 names of the Deity alluded to in the text. And these are called the Shemhamforesh.\" Seventy ‐ two is also the number of the Quinaries or sets of five degrees in the three hundred and sixty degrees of the Zodiac. The number of triangles in the mural are difficult to count. There are 22 ‐‐ isosceles, equilateral, scalene, right ‐ angled ‐‐ triangles. There are also 22 numbered letters in the ancient Hebrew alphabet, with values of one to four hundred. The triangle is an ancient emblem of Deity; it is also the sign of the female element. However, if the apex of the triangle is pointed down it becomes the male element; thus inverted it may also represent Lucifer, particularly if it is black in color. The [sphere figure...or the] spiral figure intertwined with the mural ‐ length diagonal line symbolizes the Caduceus of Hermes ([or] Mercury), which mythologically is represented as two serpents twined around the winged wand of Mercury. Nine arcs are formed by the intersections of the spiral line with the diagonal; the ninth Hebrew letter, Teth, with the value of nine, has the signification of \"serpent.\" The number of the Beast of Revelation is 666, which cabalistically is nine, the number of generation. The twin serpents of the caduceus are negative and positive (representing polarity) and twine around the spinal column. They are the Kundalini or Sex Force. In The Encircled Serpent , the chapter on the Caduceus contains references ([on] page 72) to the ancient use of the symbol without wings, as seen in the mural. The caduceus is also the symbol of peace, the propaganda term associated with the [United Nations]. The serpents are male and female; the sun ‐ god and the moon ‐ god; and are symbols of generation [or the phallus]. Buddha was symbolized by the serpent and in mythology is identical with Mercury. The center sphere and outer circles around it form the ALL ‐ SEEING EYE. This bisected sphere overlays an isosceles triangle bounded on one side by the diagonal line. According to Manly Palmer Hall, in his occult treatise on The Secret Destiny of America , the ALL ‐ SEEING EYE is that of the Great Architect of the Universe (whenever it appears as a symbol of God). His explanation is that which is generally accepted. It is, however, erroneous. A full commentary of the meaning of this all ‐ important symbol [has already been dealt with in previous episodes of the Hour of the Time]. [William Cooper: The mural, if viewed from the top, or the roof, overhead of the Meditation Room, is...is the truncated top of a pyramid. Behind the mural is a small...smaller pyramid, which is that...which contains the eye, the all ‐ seeing eye of Lucifer.] Good night, and God bless each and every single one of you.

Good evening, folks. Tonight's episode is a rerun. Due to the great mass of bullshit poured out on Radio Freemasonry just prior to this program, we will expose this wolf in sheep's clothing in his own words. Tonight, we're going to play a portion of a program that originally aired on June the 23rd, 1993. If, after hearing tonight's program, you wish to order that original broadcast, it is tape number 123 in our catalog. That's tape number 123 in our catalog. We discussed this rerun a little bit last night, so you all know the subject. But you all need to hear it again, even those of you who heard it the first time that it was broadcast, and those of you, of course, who have never heard it and are struggling, attempting to understand the purpose of the Hour of the Time. We hope that this rebroadcast will bring some things into the forefront that have lurking into the shadows, and will make some of the conversation you've heard on the Hour of the Time much clearer. We encourage you to order the original tape from the original broadcast on June 23rd, 1993, so that you may study its content in your home. Now, without further ado, we go into the rebroadcast of the mystery exposé. At the end of this rerun, ladies and gentlemen, we will open the phones for your comments and questions. [rebroadcast starts here] Now, folks, I'm going to take you into the mind of someone who has been an Initiate, an Adept, a Priest of the Mystery School for many, many years. I'm not going to identify this person until the end of the program. I want you to see if you can guess who this person is and what this is all about. If you can, then you'll know instantly what this program is for, the reason behind it, and you'll be to understand a little bit better how you've been manipulated for many, many years by the priests of the hidden religion called Mystery Babylon. And if you can't guess, then at the end of the show you're going to be told and you better be holding on to your chair, because it just might knock you right out. Just might knock you right out. I'm going to quote from a book that this person wrote. This person verified something I wrote in my book, Behold a Pale Horse , and that is the calendar of the hidden religion of Mystery Babylon. It's 6000 years and it started in 4000 B.C. and ends in the year 2000. \"The Great Pyramid system of passages and chambers is a chronological graph that begins in 4000 B.C. and continues for 6000 years.\" Now, let's go to an interview that was conducted with this person by someone else, not by me. But I'm going to be reading to you, word for word, this entire interview and this is going to take up most of the program. But this is going to give you a glimpse into the personality, the religious beliefs of the priests of the Mystery Religion, and you'll see sort of how they try to disguise what they really believe behind this aura of wanting to further the evolution of mankind and create some kind of a world Utopia, which they know in their heart is a lie to begin with. So, I'm going to call these \"Number 1\" and \"Number 2.\" Number 1 is the interviewer, Number 2 is the interviewee. [reading from 5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster , written by Richard Noone]: (start of quote) ===================================================== Number 1: How did you become interested in the Great Pyramid? Number 2: Well, like everyone else, for most of my life I accepted the idea that the Great Pyramid was just a great big pile of stones made by thousands and thousands of slaves. But I read a book in 1967 called The Ultimate Frontier . That book profoundly affected my life. In it, they made statements about the Great Pyramid being much more than a tomb. Point in fact, it never was a tomb for a pharaoh. It is a monument to mankind and human perfection. It is the oldest artifact of an ancient system of religious belief. Then I 261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"thought, that's something I could check out. I can see if the information in The Ultimate Frontier is true or not. I started investigating. I then learned a great number of things about the Great Pyramid. First of all, the ancient Greeks were quite right in calling it the \"first wonder of the world.\" When one considers the thought, preparation, and choice of site, one will see that the solid bedrock of the Giza plateau ‐‐ the only tableland within miles capable of supporting the weight of the structure ‐‐ was the most intelligent choice. There is a fantastic amount of literature about the Great Pyramid. Therefore, it is not unusual that we also find a great deal of controversy surrounding it. The British in the 1860's were the first to study the ancient building in a serious manner. By re ‐ examining the theories of the British, which were discarded by the \"experts\" of that time, the crux of my book began to take shape. Number 1: Does the crux of your book include the fact that the Great Pyramid may not have been built by the ancient Egyptians? Number 2: Yes. The British did not discuss that possibility. That possibility is my own bit of research. However, most people who study the Great Pyramid realize [that] the civilization we know as \"ancient Egyptian\" could not have built the Great Pyramid the way we know today it would have had to have been built. You see, the building is built geometrically perfect, and according to our present conception of ancient history the Egyptians didn't understand highly theoretical mathematics ‐‐ obviously from the way the other 89 major pyramids in Egypt were constructed. The manner in which the other pyramids were constructed was a very haphazard way of building. They are copies of the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid itself is, however, absolute perfection in stone both to the \"pi\" relationship, the relationship of a diameter to the circumference of a circle, and the Golden Mean or \"phi\" relationship, with which we can divide a straight line so that A² + B² = C². The reason why it was structured is embodied in the word itself, \"pyramid,\" ‐‐ [which means] \"lights and measures\" ‐‐ that there are revelation types of lights. The word for pyramid used by the ancient Egyptians was \"glorious light,\" and the word has meaning that there are revelations in the measurements. If you pursue this hint, so to speak, you find out that the builders of the Great Pyramid are the same people that wrote the original text of the Old Testament, and they laid out their plan in the Great Pyramid as well as in the Scriptures. [William Cooper: I hope, folks, you understand the significance of that one statement, and there's much, much more to come.] Number 1: Who are these people? Number 2: My opinion is they were what we call Hyksos (heck ‐ sos or hike ‐ sos), and we find traces of them throughout Meso ‐ America, India, and the Middle East in the earliest of times. The Egyptians had two or three different waves of Hyksos rulers come in. The word \"hyksos\" for many years was translated \"shepherd kings,\" which is a paradox, you see ‐‐ looking at life the way he look at it today. How can a group who were non ‐ warlike come into a land and take over and run things without any fighting? Yet they obviously did, and these ancient builders had a profound influence wherever they went. The years of research I have done tell me that the Hyksos were a group of people who had in their culture information stemming from a previous civilization. I think that our view of history, saying that it started in the \"cradle of civilization,\" in Egypt and Mesopotamia, is wrong . The surviving evidence indicates both Egypt and Mesopotamia are actually later civilizations ‐‐ remnants of a far, far greater early empire. [William Cooper: And here, folks, we see, in this person's philosophy, the same philosophy that Hitler pursued. The myth of ancient Atlantis, or Mu, if you will. An ancient civilization which, when it was destroyed, left behind a remnant, a surviving element of that race which is a super ‐ race: more intelligent, smarter, more worthy than any other race on this earth. If you will, the master race. And if you understand the esoteric meaning of what you're hearing, you are hearing Nazi philosophy, National Socialism, Hitler's vision of world history. And when you find out who this person is and what he's doing now, it will all come together. We continue:] Number 1: Do you think the Hyksos race was a race chosen by some greater intelligence to impart a superior ideology to the rest of the human race? Number 2: Not so much chose, but actually chose themselves. All genius is self ‐ appointed. I would say these people were a remnant from a previous culture and they had something they wanted to do, and they embodied their thinking in their work and the influence to people by their works. [William Cooper: Folks, that's the Luciferian philosophy. Continuing:] Number 2: They came into the land, and there were already humans in the Nile Valley, but they came into the land in an unobtrusive and dexterous maneuver so as not to alarm the existing culture. They came in without fighting. They took the worst land. They didn't try to impress their knowledge on the others. They just did things in a better way. Soon the people in that area were paying attention to them. Once they gained the attention of the people, it didn't take very long before they were running everything, because they did everything with better methodology, which is the way life ought to be ‐‐ you ought to show by example. Number 1: What happened then? 262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Number 2: Fairly soon after arriving, they suggested to the people that as life was now so peaceful and harmonious, it would be a happy challenge to build a monument to the future, to the future of mankind. In my opinion the Hyksos philosophy and the philosophy of many modern people is identical, in that human beings CAN BE PERFECT IF THEY WORK TOWARD THAT END [emphasis added by Mr. Cooper]. [William Cooper: ... and that is the heart and soul philosophy of Mystery Babylon, the Mystery Schools. That man, himself, will become God. Wait until you find out who this is.] Number 1: What happened to the ancient tribe, the Hyksos? Number 2: I think they are still in existence today and have not died out but have gone underground many thousands of years ago. What we call Masonry, Freemasonry is an offshoot of the group that started out. The Hyksos group became what The Ultimate Frontier calls, \"The Brotherhoods.\" These are a group of people who have knowledge about what it really means to be human... [William Cooper: And folks, that implies that the rest of us are not, and that also is in direct line and in direct concert with the philosophy of the Mystery Religion of Babylon. You see, to them we are all cattle...animals. We have no intelligence. Continuing:] Number 2: These are a group of people who have knowledge about what it really means to be human, to be a human becoming, to grow toward human perfection ‐‐ it's a philosophical thing. These people still exist. They still band together in groups here and there, and they show by doing. Again, their lifestyle shows that they really have a handle on life is all about. They don't try to impress others with numbers or with what they know, they just live doing something they want to accomplish while they are here. We know in Egypt these people have formed secret societies and that Pharaoh Akhnaton came up \"under the rose\" out of one of these secret societies and took over the land of Egypt in a manner that forbids disclosure, at a time in which the superficial popular theology left a want unsatisfied, which religion in a wider sense alone could supply. [William Cooper: And there, he has admitted that he knows, he knows the esoteric teachings of the Mystery Schools, their origin and their purpose. And if you've been listening from the beginning, now you know that this person is a priest of the Mystery Religion, himself. Continuing:] Number 2: We know Alexander the Great wanted to get the knowledge of one of these ancient secret societies, because he writes about it a great deal. Pythagoras consented to be circumcised in order to become one of the initiates of these secret societies ‐‐ which are the Hyksos population carrying their knowledge of science and the universe and cosmology with them and keeping the truth secret so they wouldn't be persecuted and wiped out. You can imagine what society today would do to a group of people like this, were they to perform certain \"ancient rituals\" in public. Look what they did to Akhnaton ‐‐ as soon as he was dead they destroyed the city he built. Number 1: That's right, they tried to ‐‐ Number 2: Wipe his name out. Number 1: Yes, because he taught there was only one God. Number 2: The human tendency in the mass populace... Number 1: When you use the term \"mass populace,\" are you referring to a group of people who have become undeveloped on account of a too pleasant or a too severe climate, or even from physiological or psychological causes? Number 2: The phrase \"mass populace\" was a term used by the ancient ones which usually refers to those in a populace, any populace, in any country, who sit back waiting for some savior to raise them up out of their misery. [William Cooper: Recognize the venom directed at Christianity, folks?] Number 1: Then you are referring to people who are merely living a conditioned response to their environment? Number 2: Yes, the human tendency in the mass populace is to tear things down rather than reach up to the excellent, which brings everything down to mediocrity. We're doing that in this country today with our so ‐ called standards from the federal government ‐‐ everything's got to be brought down. This is just another social indication of this tendency in human beings to bring things down to a lower level so it's easier ‐‐ instead of striving for excellence. The Hyksos people went after pleasing results who worked hard in this manner. They strove for excellence and, therefore they had to go underground to keep from being persecuted. In almost every case that we can trace, anyone that tried to bring the truth to man has been crucified, or killed in some cruel or barbarous human ritual. 263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: And folks, for many years, that was exactly true. But this is not the true intent of these people, for if you also go back through history, you'll find that these are the people who have been behind every religious war, have been behind every revolution, have been behind, and at literally are, the heart and soul of Socialism and Communism. And everywhere they go, death follows, and a stench.] Number 1: Do you how the Great Pyramid was constructed? Number 2: I leave that puzzle to the engineers, architects and professors of physics who have researched and studied the building. No one at the present really knows. There are several suppositions, but since no one really knows, that mystery remains to be answered in the next 24 years. And since no one really knows, in my opinion, there's no such thing as an \"expert.\" Number 1: In that case, how do you believe the Great Pyramid may have been constructed? Number 2: My information, from people who seem very knowledgeable, says that they built in with water blocks and floated the blocks into place. That's pretty hard to conceive of, because they would have had to have been tremendous locks, because the Great Pyramid is up on a plateau at least six miles from the banks of the Nile river. Water with a series of basins and pipes that match the corridor and the chamber system of the Great Pyramid's interior system embodies all the laws of hydraulic engineering. For example, the Great Pyramid's Grand Gallery is a perfect \"vacuum bottle\" in this pumping system, which I explain in my book as I explore the research work of Edward J. Kunkel, author of the book, Pharaoh's Pump . ===================================================== (end of quote) [William Cooper: Well, folks, it's time to take our break. Don't go away. We'll be right back and continue with this revelation after this very short pause.] [break: Old radio commercial for Rice Krispies cereal ] [William Cooper: And we continue, folks:] (start of quote) ===================================================== Number 1: If this tribe of people, the Hyksos, caused the Great Pyramid to be constructed, did they know their message wouldn't be understood for thousands of years, or did they think that humans would grasp its meaning a little before that? Number 2: I think it's quite apparent that they knew it would be grasped in the 20th century. I think that they laid it out so the core of their meaning would be picked up by those who really have the mathematical knowhow. It wasn't until 1905 that we had the real understanding of gravitational astronomy, the astronomy involving the solar system and the movement of the earth around the sun, down so pat that we had all the answers the builders of the Great Pyramid had. They knew as much or more about today's system of gravitational astronomy as we know. Number 1: Do you think this falls in line with a number of other theories that humans were at one time visited by supremely intelligent beings from other worlds? Number 2: I don't accept that thesis. However, I believe that there is life probably on every little planetoid in the entire universe, life that is similar to ours in [having] a spiritual nature, but somewhat different in physical nature. No other beings from outer space ever came down here and cohabited with the apes, as Mr. von Daniken would say. I would reject that thesis but, on the other hand, I would say we are indeed created by another intelligence far greater than this planet or even the solar system. You know, it's a funny thing. I was once an atheist. I went through most of my college days as an atheist. I went through most of my college days as an anthropologist, and didn't believe in a created theory at all, but after studying for many years I was forced to accept the fact that I had obviously had been created ‐‐ because it just didn't happen by chance. There's no way. I would say that this theory that something in outer space came down and interfered is quite accurate, in that respect. We are in the image of a creator of some kind that we can't even conceive. Therefore we 264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"have the ability to all kinds of fantastic things. I think there was a civilization 50,000 years ago in the Pacific, now underwater, that had in it achievements that we only think of today. Number 1: OK, just a minute ‐‐ let me backtrack here. At the beginning of the interview you mentioned that you began your investigation of the Great Pyramid after you read The Ultimate Frontier . What's it all about? Number 2: Oh, that's a big topic! The Ultimate Frontier ties together a history of this planet, the idea and purpose for mankind being a part of it, and a philosophy of growth towards human perfection ‐‐ and how this philosophy is what life is really all about. The truth of this was lost when the great civilization on the Pacific continent of Mu was destroyed by a sudden cataclysmic change on the crust of the earth 50,000 years ago. There are a group of individuals who call themselves the \"Brotherhoods,\" unobtrusively working to uplift mankind back to this ancient wisdom belief, and the Great Pyramid is indeed a monument to this particular Brotherhood. Number 1: Perhaps the truth is never lost. Perhaps as we evolve towards a true understanding of essentials, we suddenly find ourselves faced with a question where we discover we have really understood nothing at all, and consequently we have to begin learning all over again on a new and higher level. Perhaps the memory of the destruction of Mu and other catastrophic events is contained in the collective unconsciousness of man. Perhaps some humans ‐‐ direct genetic descendants of the survivors of these cataclysmic events ‐‐ carry in their bloodline a genetic mutation. [William Cooper: Let me read that portion again, folks: \"Perhaps some humans ‐‐ direct genetic descendants of the survivors of these cataclysmic events ‐‐ carry in their bloodline a genetic mutation.\"] Number 1: Perhaps this genetic mutation was deeply imprinted into the central nervous system...of some of our forbearers, who actually experienced and survived a sudden slippage in the earth's tectonic plates or a supernova explosion. Such a genetic mutation, passed in genetic structures ([or] DNA) from generation to generation, may explain why some of us today are more acutely sensitive to subtle Earth tremors than our neighbors. In any case...this book, The Ultimate Frontier , started your mental processes working along these lines. Number 2: Ah ‐‐ they were already working along this line, just like many people's are without knowing about it. I had started into an investigation the phenomena and mysticism on my own, because of my religious convictions couldn't answer my questions. Going to different churches and checking them out I found didn't answer my questions as to why I am. I've always wanted to know why . The human physiology is a remarkable thing. Why should it be? Why should we be different than the animals? Why should we have these philosophies when no other animals has philosophy? I studied many of the standard religions, but they couldn't answer my question to my satisfaction. I didn't like the idea of blind faith. [repeats: I didn't like the idea of blind faith.] To me blind faith is irresponsible and unreasonable. Then I got into science and became an atheist. I was working on a masters degree in anthropology and found that, just like the churches, the information from the scientific side fell short. They can't answer all the questions. In fact, the more we learn, the more anomalies we have, and we realize how little we know. Then my son ‐‐ who at the time was four ‐ and ‐ a ‐ half years old ‐‐ nearly drowned. In fact, he did drown. He was full of saltwater and unconscious for 45 minutes. He should by all rights have died. The year was 1960. I was eating at a restaurant on the beach when I saw him floating face down in the water. I ran across the beach, jumped into the water, handed him to my brother, who handed him to a strange old man who appeared to be a derelict. When this old man pumped out the water ‐‐ I was in shock ‐‐ out of my son [for] the next 45 minutes. He refused to give my son to the ambulance crew and the doctor who had arrived had pronounced him dead. The old man looked into my eyes and said, \"This boy isn't dead. I'm going to bring him back.\" I told the doctor, \"Let him keep trying,\" and the old man kept working. Forty ‐ five minutes is a long period of time to remain unconscious without breathing. However, my son not only recovered without brain damage from that episode, but he told us in the hospital exactly all the events that took place ‐‐ from me running out of that restaurant, jumping across the breakwater, diving into the water and getting him, handing him up to my brother ‐‐ he recalled all of this as if he had been watching it as a spectator, and yet he was unconscious. I mean, he wasn't Jean Dixon or anything. That personal experience was positive proof in my mind that the human mind is a lot greater than that body. Number 1: Did it reinforce a previous belief, or did it really serve to allow you to see for the first time that there are other realities? Number 2: It made me relook at some of my own experiences. It made me stop and think about a lot of things. For instance, the first thing it made me think of was when I was studying anthropology, I was studying the theory of evolution, chance evolution, chemistry just providing a scenario for itself to keep procreating and surviving and improving and so on. If we accept evolution as the ultimate answer, we have to accept a ludicrous notion that atoms ‐‐ all matter is made up of the atomic elements ‐‐ can so arrange themselves as to be able to give themselves abstract qualities, such as memory, desire, will, curiosity, consciousness, conscience, creativity, intuition, emotion and reason. How can you get that chemically? You can't. It has to be something else that is endowed, and man is the only one that has it ‐‐ a goat doesn't see the stars or know what's over the mountain or know anything about life and death, you see. But we do. These ideas were in my head, and intuitively I knew there was much more, but when that happened to my son then I realized that I too am a discrete bundle of mental energy ‐‐ only I didn't have that phraseology for it. I didn't know about what life was all about as I feel I 265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"do now. Number 1: Were you able to determine the capability of the human being to deal with all these diverse areas of knowledge? Number 2: Certainly, I am doing it and [I am] nothing extraordinary. I am dealing with all of these areas of knowledge in a relaxed and causal and fun way, and I feel that I am growing. I am not impatient about my growth, because I know that someday, if I continue to try to improve myself, if I continue to use those qualities of mind that I have, then I will become as perfect as humanly possible. Now according to our basic beliefs in this country, human beings are created in the image of their creator. To me that means we have the same qualities of mind. We're certainly not the physical image, but the mental image. We have will, memory, desire, curiosity, consciousness, creativity, conscience ‐‐ [I have] gone through those before ‐‐ intuition, emotion, reason ‐‐ those ten qualities of mind are the same qualities as the creator [has]. Perhaps we can never become absolute perfection as the creator, whatever it is, must have been. I cannot conceive of the creative force, not enough to verbalize it and makes sense to everyone, but I think we can obtain relative perfection and become one with the creator by improving ourselves based upon what we have to work with. There's no limit to human abilities, to what humans can do. We limit ourselves by our own conditioning. Number 1: Do you think that most people are really trying to find out about all these things? Number 2: Many humans are. I would say there are millions of people who have an inner urging towards something better, especially in this day and age, because now there are more of them here. Out of the great majority, roughly 220,000,000 people today in the United States, only about two or three million are really interested in what makes them tick, what is involved in life, the purpose of it all, and in really growing and building on their character. The other two hundred and something million are merely living a conditioned response from their environment, and they don't think about it at all. Look, here we are in the city of Atlanta, a huge city. Look at the people walking back and forth. They're positive in many ways, and yet they never really give any thought as to why they are, why they're capable of building these tremendous buildings and driving those tremendous vehicles they drive and ‐‐ [ *Note: audio is cut off here for a few seconds, actual text is as follows: ‐‐ where they got this great gift of mind and how really little they're using it ‐‐ they don't give it a single thought. Number 1: Fundamental religion has been undergoing so may changes in the past few years.] [ audio resumes ]: Catholicism has been losing quite a few members because those members say that their religion is not in tune with the times, and this is the case in many other religious bodies. Do you believe that formal religion is just not keeping in tune with the times, or has it ever been in tune with them? Number 2: Oh, considerably in tune. Essentially, it's this: the church for the last two thousand years has done a remarkable job with what it's had to work with. Remember, they're dealing with part of the truth. [William Coops: Part of the truth.] I've just finished this week a new book, called The Life and Death of Planet Earth . Now, what it points out is that the absolute truth is what we're all trying to find out, and we prove this subjectively. [As] we know it and nobody can change our minds, because we know it just like I know that fire burns my fingers because I've stuck them in there. You can tell me all you want, but I won't believe it until I do it. Knowledge is what we're seeking. The churches started off with a paradigm ‐‐ a framework of understanding ‐‐ and they had to work within that framework, and their framework was quite narrow. Then Jesus came along and broadened it tremendously. He resurrected the ideas of love and brotherhood, and working you ‐ too ‐ can ‐ do ‐ as ‐ I ‐ do. He was showing by his lifestyle that you can be perfect, you can know yourself, you can know your creator, you can know what it's all about. All you have to do is get off the dime and stop being so lazy and pay attention. That's what he was saying. Human beings have a tendency to want to put frameworks around things so they can be comfortable with them. So the early church put a framework around the truth. Theologians have translated and interpreted what has been said by all the great teachers until it's been quite distorted. However, even with all of the translations and misinterpretations of what was really said in the ancient times, they've done a remarkable job. They've done some bad things as well as good things in the eye of history, but the information is here. All you have to do is want it and dig for it. I found it. I found it for myself. There's more than one path. The reason I follow the path of the Great Pyramid is because I'm a doubter, [or] a skeptic, and [there is] something made of stone, the world's largest stone structure. It can be checked and rechecked and measured and remeasured. It's been around for a very, very long time and there's no doubt it's there. However, [in] the metaphysical idea ‐‐ somebody going into a trance and some voice talking through him telling me he's Jesus ‐‐ that doesn't prove anything to me. It could be, but I could never prove it. I can prove that the Great Pyramid does, and that turned me on. There are answers to everyone's questions. We each have progressed. You see, I accept we have lived many thousands of lifetimes. [William Cooper: Let me repeat that: \"I accept we have lived many thousands of lifetimes.\"] Number 2: People say, \"Oh, reincarnation, I can't believe that.\" Well, they probably didn't believe it in their last lifetime either. I probably 266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"didn't either. However, each time we live a life we learn something more towards this perfection [William Cooper:, this perfection]. We're supposed to be [growing] until finally, we reach a point where we choose our incarnation with such great care that we incarnate to two very sharp parents ‐‐ at which point we grow with a tremendous rate of speed. That's the purpose of it all. Civilization's purpose is to provide the playground, the background, the environment that enhances soul growth, character growth. An environment which enhances the ability of humans to practice the virtues. By practicing these virtues (love, brotherhood, and working you ‐ too ‐ can ‐ do ‐ as ‐ I ‐ do) which are part of universal law ‐‐ what you put out comes back to you[, karma] ‐‐ you set an example for others. By practicing patience, tolerance, forbearance, kindness, and charity in your everyday life, you grow. By your example you set off a multitude of self ‐ sustaining series of events, a chain reaction which strengthens the truth. I found this for myself. This is the message in all of the esoteric teachings in all seven of the great religions. I think the key, the key thing that the present human civilization is missing, is that the idea has been lost, that we're all responsible. Individual responsibility has been lost. We want some wizard to come along and do it for us. We want the preacher on Sunday to save us from our sins. We want the man in the confessional booth to cleanse us. We don't want to do it for ourselves. Well, there are no wizards. Every single ego, every single created individual or discreet bundle of mental energy, must do it for himself. This is part of the message of the Great Pyramid, and as soon as humans realize this and take responsibility for their actions, the problems of the planet earth will be diminished a thousand fold. Number 1: I found it most fascinating, the fact you mentioned a moment ago, that the individual ego has a hand in the choice of his or her own incarnated person. Number 2: This is esoteric information. I use the term \"esoteric\" information, \"esoteric\" meaning \"inside,\" inside information, and it's only information that has been given to me. I've not proven it yet. Even if I did prove it, it will still be only information to you. So, the difference between information and knowledge is clear. We need to make that clear. Now, my information is that each of us chooses our parents and our situation, even our race. [William Cooper: Listen to this, folks, listen to this crap! Beginning again:] Number 2: One of the individuals that I have been told about in this esoteric information was George Washington Carver, who deliberately incarnated into a race that was downtrodden to work on the idea of bringing them up. He was an ego of tremendous advancement, and when he did incarnate into that environment, which was a terrible environment, I understand he may have lost a few points because he became embittered near the end. Had he remained without bitterness, he would have gained. This is the story I have. We all take a chance incarnating into a civilization that can drag us down, because when you get inside of a physical body you become the subject of the nuisances of that animal body and the conditioning and the responses, and it's up to you with those ten qualities of mind to overcome those. That's why being well disciplined is vitally important, and permissiveness is not wise. [William Cooper: Well, folks, there's no way I'm able to read to you all of this interview because it's just too long. So, I'm going to pick out some pertinent points. This is Number 2 talking and this is an excerpt from a paragraph: \"However, don't permit it. Don't say, 'Laziness is good for everybody, because you won't get uptight if you're lazy.' We have so many errors on the idea of human potential and what to do with it. I believe in being well disciplined, but not cruelly. I believe in responsibility. In the organization I belong to, the Stelle Group...\"] [William Cooper: The Stelle Group, the group in which Lars Hansen was reared. Now I want to quote to you from a book, called The New World Order by A. Ralph Epperson, which you can order from Publius Press in Tucson, Arizona. On page 67 in The New World Order , Mr. A Ralph Epperson has a direct quote from Eklal Kueshana. He was the leader of the Stelle Group. Mr. Texe Marrs also has the same quote in one or two of his books, but I'm taking this from The New World Order by A Ralph Epperson: \"Lucifer is the head of a secret Brotherhood of Spirits...the Brotherhood is named after Lucifer because the great Angel Lucifer has been responsible for the abolishment of Eden in order that men could begin on the road to a spiritual advancement.\" That is the teachings of the leader of the Stelle Group, the group that this man belongs to. So folks, pay attention. This again is Number 2 speaking:] Number 2: This is a part of the message a band of men at the dawning of the Age of Taurus, a more civilized age, embodied in the Great Pyramid's mathematical code to transmit to a generation of humans living in the Age of Aquarius, something they felt was vitally important. The Age of Aquarius began 23 August 1953, and this is a new ‐ age idea: the idea that we can perceive and try to improve. Of course there's still a larger majority of humans, even in the Age of Aquarius, that want to drag people down and lower the standards. However, every single ego, every single human, has the capabilities of bringing himself up to the equal of his creator. It's just a matter of effort and patience and practicing the virtues. Number 1: As Jesus stood between the two columns Jachin and Boaz on the outer porch of King Solomon's temple (John 10[, verse 23]) on [25th] December ‐‐ the celebration of the winter solstice [William Cooper: which is what that date is really for] ‐‐ a large majority of the people did not understand him when he said, \"Ye are gods\" (John 10[, verse 34]). Some people in the crowd took up stones to kill him as the money ‐ changer in the temple cocked his head away from his table to see what some in the crowd were yelling about. He heard Jesus say, \"Is it not written in your law, I said ye are gods,\" as he saw a law ‐ giver of the temple sit bolt upright to listen to this man 267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"speaking to the crowd. The money ‐ changer wondered why such an important law ‐ giver of the temple sat up to listen, as rigid as a rod of iron, remembering the law and his responsibility. As the lawgiver remembered Psalm 82:6, he remembered a song of Asaph, in which God said, \"Ye are gods.\" The man speaking to the crowd said, \"The Father is in me, and I in Him,\" and what he meant could not have been other than what he said. As the crowd screamed, \"Blasphemy!\" and moved forward to kill Jesus, he simply disappeared. So when you say humans have the capability to bring themselves up to the equal of their creator, it would seem to me that this \"new ‐ age idea\" is in reality a very, very ancient idea. However, you did say that that this is part of the message of the Great Pyramid ‐‐ but what about these ancient brotherhoods, these people who are responsible for all these secret type of teaching, which seems to be such a mystical type of notion ‐‐ are they still around today? Number 2: I think so, very much. In fact, I can say I know it ‐‐ you can say it's information now. The \"brothers\" are those individuals who have obtained a degree in advancement over other humans. [William Cooper: This, also, is Number 2.] Number 2: ...if you meet a Brother, and you get him alone and you say, \"I've noticed about you certain things, and...want to ask you if you are familiar with the Rosicrucians or the Masons or the Stelle Group or the book The Ultimate Frontier or some of these metaphysical philosophies\" ‐‐ you, when you ask, are allowing him to interfere in your environment. This is the teacher appearing when the student is ready. But unless you ask, the Brothers won't help. [William Cooper]: And here's the crux, folks. Number 2: ...Yes. The fifth level of intelligence is responsible for the direct work with the planet, and they can make mistakes. The story of Lucifer and Jehovah is a tale of the mistake made by the angelic intelligence. The argument between the angelic forces on the fifth level of existence is that Jehovah, according to my philosophy, believed that humans could advance with a perfect environment, so at first, humans were given the Edenic State. All they had to do was eat bananas, sleep, chase the girls, make love, swim, sun and sleep. But they didn't grow in that Edenic state. All they wanted to do was eat, drink, make love, and sleep some more. They didn't want to grow, so Lucifer said, \"We should help mankind grow ‐‐ and you know the rules, we can't go down and do it for them, so we'll give them problems to overcome.\" And ZAP ‐‐ like the thunderbolt of Zeus, Eden was gone and we now have winters in Chicago. And man has to overcome. ===================================================== (end of quote) [William Cooper]: Now, folks, I don't care if this man worships Lucifer. I don't care if he believes what he believes or belongs to the Mystery Schools. You all know me, I believe in the Constitution, and that we all have a right. But when he deceives and manipulates all of us, and when on June 8th, 1993 on Radio Free America, he said to the world that I am a CIA disinformation agent, then it's time that you knew who this man really is. I want you to track down and read these books that he wrote: The Great Pyramid: Man's Monument to Man , New York, Pinnacle Books, 1975. The Life and Death of Planet Earth , New York, Pinnacle Books, 1977. Psychic Surgery , 1973 (reprint edition), Chicago, Pocket Books, 1975. The entire text of the interview you heard tonight can be found in a book called 5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster , by Richard W. Noone, spelled N ‐ O ‐ O ‐ N ‐ E, and he was the interviewer, Number 1. Folks, research the history of Willis Carto. Research the history of the Liberty Lobby, and specifically Radio Free America. Tom Valentine has been a member of the Stelle Group for most of his life. He has also been closely connected to the Communist party by his own admission. Wake up! The members, the high priests of the Mystery Schools are enacting Ordo Ab Chaos [sic], create enough chaos and then they can step up and take control and establish order, The New World Order. Now you know why, on Radio Free America, Tom Valentine gets so angry when someone questions Freemasonry. Now you know why he covers for the secret societies and for Freemasonry, and now you why he's attacked me, because I am the enemy of Mystery Babylon. And there you have it, folks. [rebroadcast stops here] And yes, there you do have it, ladies and gentlemen. I want to read to you a letter that I received today. Talk about synchronicity! From 268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"my good friend in Tucson, Arizona, A. Ralph Epperson, he says, and I quote: \"You might enjoy letting your listeners know about a quote I just found in a book, entitled Legenda of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States , written by Albert Pike. This book was written by Mr. Pike in 1888, three years before he died, and was published by the 33rd degree Council when they were in Charleston, South Carolina. This quote should settle the question once and for all as to who the god is that the Masons worship in their lodges. Here, in Tucson, one of their lodges is called a 'cathedral,' and another is called a 'temple,' two words describing places of worship. This quote will prove concretely that the god they worship is not the God of the Bible. I have been looking for this book by Pike for many years, and presumed that it was out ‐ of ‐ print because I couldn't locate a copy. However, I knew it was not forgotten, because Rex Hutchins, then a 32nd degree Mason, but who later became a 33rd degree Mason, quoted from it in his Masonic book, entitled A Bridge to Light . So I considered it fortunate when I found that a publisher of out ‐ of ‐ print and rare books called Kessinger Publishing Company in Kila, Montana had reprinted it. It is their claim that Legenda is a series of monographs intended to supplement the ritualistic instruction of the book written by Mr. Pike, called Morals and Dogma . As you know, the first ten words of the Bible are found in Genesis, chapter 1, verse 1 and are: 'In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.' That means that in the time before there was something, there had to be nothing. So, God created something out of nothing when he created the universe, or there would not have been a need for a beginning. But Mr. Pike does not agree. This is what he says on page 109 of Legenda in his explanation of the 28th degree: 'Nothing is produced from nothing, because existence can no more cease to be than nothing can cease not to be. To say that the world came forth from nothing is to propose a monstrous absurdity. Everything that Is, proceeds from that which was, and consequently nothing of that which Is can ever not be.' The letter 'I' in the word 'Is' was capitalized by Mr. Pike. It is customary to capitalize the first letter in the name of a deity, or a noun that refers to a deity. Does this mean that he is making a deity out of matter?\" Well, folks, Lucifer is the god of the material world, so Mr. Pike says that those of us who believe in a God who created the universe out of nothing believe in a \"monstrous absurdity.\" The Christians and the Jews who believe in the God of the Old and New Testaments believe in a \"monstrous absurdity\" when they profess that their God made the universe out of nothing. Let there be no doubt: Pike told his readers that he and the Masons do not worship the Creator, God. They worship a secret and concealed god in their cathedrals and temples, who cannot create anything. In fact, Mr. Pike agreed with that statement. He wrote this about their \"sun god\" on pages 253 and 254 of Morals and Dogma . I might remind you that Radio Free America is carried by the Sun Radio Network. \"Ammon, at first, the god of lower Egypt, was the sun god. He created nothing.\" And to show that this is true, he repeated the idea on page 281, \"The supreme being of the Egyptians was Ammon, a secret and concealed god, the original light. He creates nothing.\" Yet he calls this god the \"supreme being\". If the universe had two gods, one who created everything from nothing and one who created nothing, I would presume the first god who made everything, including the second god, would be superior to the second god, who created nothing. So the only way you can resolve this problem if you believe in this second god who created nothing is to claim that there's no Creator, God. Then your god can then be become the supreme being, and that is what Mr. Pike did. Make no mistake about it, the Masons do not worship the Creator, God, the God who made the world out of nothing, and that is why they have chosen to call their god, \"The Great Architect of the Universe,\" and that is why the Brotherhood in the ancient times was called, \"The Builders\" and today are called, \"Freemasons,\" or \"franc ‐ maçon\" in the French. It is known that architects do not draw plans to create a structure out of nothing. They design structures that must be built from existing materials, or, if you will, out of materials that must be changed from one form to another before they can be integrated into a structure. The Masons worship some other being, one that they know can create nothing, and that includes the Stelle Group. That includes the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross, the Knights Templars, the sovereign and military Order of the Knights of Malta and all of the rest of these skunks. The number one Mason of all time has said, ladies and gentlemen, in his own writings. I have never claimed that Tom Valentine was a Freemason; I have only claimed what you have heard in this broadcast tonight, and I am sick of his stinking lies, and I am sick and tired of you stupid sheeple out there who cannot study or listen or repeat exactly what you hear, but have to make up some strange tale in order to cover your pathetic ignorance. Ladies and gentleman, I do not attack people, I reveal them. I wish nobody ill will. I don't care what alter anyone worships upon. You are listening to a true Constitutionalist who believes 100% in our right to protect us, the religion of our choice. I would fight for any one of you if that right were threatened to be taken away. Where I draw the line is when you lie, when you deceive and when you manipulate the rest of us to pit us against each other so that you could bring about your silly, stupid Utopia, your dream of a thousand years of peace on this earth. You will never do it because you are mankind, just like me and everyone else, who you claim are nothing but cattle. And because you are man, just like me and everyone else, you suffer for the same inherent failings that I, and everybody else who lives upon this earth, suffers [sic] from. You have the same temptations and the same greed and you fight every day against these things. And to say that you, you are the only truly mature minds in this world, and that you are going to control the rest of us because we do not have the capability or the power to think for ourselves is not only ludicrous, but is what eventually will bring you to your knees as we round you up and throw you in the jails and the prisons where you belong, and stop your wrecking of all the good than man has built upon the face of this earth. Don't pervert my words, because I'm the only one you'll ever hear on the radio who uses fact, who uses [their own] words of the people that I talk about, and I have no ulterior motive of trying to hurt anyone. The only reason for this broadcast and for me sitting here, ladies and gentlemen, is to wake the sheeple, empower the people and try like hell to save freedom, for not only for this country but for the entire world. 269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Now, if you cannot understand what you heard tonight, then you are one of the most stupid ones out there. Those of you who are sheeple, who think you understood but aren't quite sure, but you believe that you are getting some meaning in what you heard tonight, you have a chance. And, of course, the rest of you, the people who have listened to the over thirty ‐ two hours of the Mystery series that we've aired on this program, you already know the truth, and you are the hope for the future in this nation. Ladies and gentlemen, I have said it before and I'll say it again: these people practice the Hegelian conflict, political resolution, and they control both sides of each conflict. Tom Valentine never said a word on his program about Freemasonry until I forced him to by my broadcast, and if you don't believe that, you go back and listen to all the tapes. Remember, a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table, by choice and consent. Shortly after I originally ran this program, Tom Valentine came on with the master of the Stelle Group and claimed that he became a Christian in 1968 and left the Stelle Group forever. And that is a lie, because in the interview that you just heard, he claimed that he was loyal to the group to which he belonged, the Stelle Group. That interview was conducted in 1976, and that book was published in 1982. I've said it before, I will say it again: Tom Valentine, you are a liar and if you are not, sue me. We'll let a court of law determine it. I have all the evidence I need, mister. All of you out there listening, good night, and whether you believe it or not, I mean this from my heart: God bless you all.

(William Cooper continues to talk about his different time slots) Tonight's show is important, for it verifies everything that I've been telling you in the Mystery Babylon series, which we have done 31 episodes of. And we have included, \"The Dawn of Man,\" which ran prior to the production of the Mystery Babylon series and any orders for this series. So, that actually makes 32 tapes. But tonight's episode will be episode number 32 of the series known as Mystery Babylon. Don't go away, folks. You need to know what you're going to hear tonight. (opening music: God Part II , performed by U2) For those of you who don't believe that those who call themselves illumined, the only truly mature minds in this world and thus, are the only ones capable of deciding the future, or of ruling the rest of us...those of you who don't believe these people have infiltrated all levels of our society ‐‐ our government, our military, our law enforcement ‐‐ I want you to listen carefully to what I'm going to read you. I'm going to quote, verbatim, an article which appeared in the newsletter called Aid and Abet Police Newsletter, volume 2, Constitutional Issues for Lawmen, number 1 ...volume 2, number 1. That's Aid and Abet Police Newsletter . Now, this letter, according to the editor of this newsletter, was written by a police chief. Here, he uses a pseudonym, so he says, so that the police chief's identity is not revealed. However, as you will find out, if you have listened to our series on Mystery Babylon, this is not just a police chief. This is a highly degreed member of the Masonic Lodge, and he gives himself away with his symbology. For the end of his article, he signs it, \"So mote it be.\" Aid and Abet is put out by officer Jack McLamb, who has been written up as one of the best police officers ever produced by the state of Arizona. We neither endorse him, nor do we condemn him. As far as CAJI is concerned, our vote is not in yet on this organization. We know that in order to bring about the New World Order, they need to identify everyone who will uphold the real law, the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. They need to identify those people and get them out of positions of authority and, if necessary, take them out of society completely. There are organizations which exist solely for the purpose of identifying those people in government, those people in the patriot community, those police officers serving in police organizations, who would ultimately support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights against any effort to destroy it. Aid and Abet may be one of these means. We do not know that for certain. But if you listen to this letter...this letter, because it's signed with a pseudonym, may not be from a police chief at all, but may be from those 271"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"who control Aid and Abet to tell the police officers what is expected of them in the New World Order. Again, we do not know this to be true. But we have discovered, ladies and gentlemen, that in our investigations, that those who oppose us ‐‐ who would destroy us ‐‐ used the Hegelian dialectic of political conflict resolution. They control both sides of every issue. They set in motion methods and means to identify their enemy, and destroy their enemy, before their enemy can hurt them. And that's why we have been on the losing end for literally thousands of years with these people. I now quote from this newsletter: [Reading from Aid and Abet :] (start of quote) ===================================================== To the question of, \"Do some judges, prosecutors and police officers today commit dishonest acts to put criminals away?\" I answer an unequivocal, Yes! But, it is hoped that it is not done without just cause. True immorality exists only when the cause is not just. [William Cooper: Notice how they turn the definition of morality around. He goes on:] After more than 20 years of service to my fellow Americans I realize what reality is. The truth is that today many judges, attorneys, police officials and officers are devotees of the religion of Secular Humanism (S.H.), myself included. Some of our members (mainly out of fear) will not admit that S.H. is a religion [William Cooper: that's Secular Humanism is a religion]. They are apprehensive that we might be treated as the so ‐ called \"Christians\" have been treated under the doctrine of Separation of Church and State. Such fear might be well founded if this were 15 to 20 years ago. Not so today. Reason being, colleagues of our faith are, for the most part, in control of the agencies and organizations, such as the ACLU, ABA, Justice Dept. etc., that would normally protest such cases. Although this may at first seem unfair, it is not. But allow me to proceed, and I believe you will come to full understanding of this and many other important facts. My feelings are that it is time we shepherds open the eyes of our flock and further sort out those we cannot take with us into the 21st century. [William Cooper: I'm going to pause here. In case you don't understand exactly what this man just said, I'm going to read this paragraph again to you. Remember, this is purported to be a police chief writing under a pseudonym to the police newsletter called Aid and Abet . Listen very carefully, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll see when I've labeled you sheeple, I have not been...I have not been incorrect.] [repeats:] My feelings are that it is time we shepherds open the eyes of our flock and further sort out those we cannot take with us into the 21st. Century. [William Cooper: Now, those of you who thought that I was insane when I told you that, if you don't go along with the New World Order ‐‐ if you can't renounce your old religion and your old societal ways and your old morals and conform to the new age ‐‐ you will be exterminated. They make no secret of this. I continue:] Any that would deny that our religion of [Secular Humanism] is not a valid religion should do their homework. The Supreme Court decided that it is a religion some years ago in the Torcaso vs Abington, Abington vs Schempp, and in Torcaso vs Watkins cases. According to the High Court, it is \"...belief, not body, creed, or cult which appears to be the essence of religion.\" It further explains that, \"...'belief' refers to some sort of universal view of life, of the world of mankind ‐ a belief that is held to be true about mankind.\" In essence the Supreme Court said that one's religion can be \"...any world view with or without reference to GOD, theistic or non ‐ theistic in nature\". I hope this helps others to understand our Faith, however, this of course is not the main point of my speech. I wish to address the abuse of Police Officers who ascribe, knowingly or unknowingly, to the moral tenants of our religion in regards to ethics and morals. Nationwide our devotees are enduring horrible discrimination at the hands of a very hypocritical faction of society, the Christians. This discrimination comes as we Humanists exercise our own religious beliefs and apply our morals \"on the job,\" so to speak. Yet, other officers may apply their own individual belief systems (morals and ethics) at will, without any condemnation. This is undeniable discrimination! Fortunately, our religion is the fastest growing of any in all of history and many of the younger generation within the criminal justice 272"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"system, including police officers, who ascribe to sound Secular Humanist principals are now in management which is of benefit to all. This does give us sway power, and is a plus for our side. Still, there is far too much discrimination against those who would apply a most important principle of our religion ‐‐ \"Situation Ethics\". The principal of Situation Ethics allows the individual to focus correctly on only the goal to be accomplished. Morally speaking, little if any consideration need be given to the method or means, as nothing else supersedes its importance. Of course concern is given to finding a means of accomplishing a task or goal, so as to have the least negative impact on the least amount of our people. [William Cooper: Notice he says, \"our people.\"] In my youth I recall hearing the great Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi describe it this way: \"Winning is not everything; it is the only thing.\" Much of our society lives by this principal today. Yes, even many of those who \"profess other faiths\" and occupy pulpits throughout America. Personally, I think the principle of Situation Ethics is best described by examining the legal definition of ethics and morals given by our now compatriots, the Communists. The Communist definition is: \"EVERYTHING is ethical and moral as long as it promotes World Communism.\" This is pure Secular Humanism. We can learn much, incidentally, about total commitment from the Communists. The Marxists have, out of pragmatic necessity, expurgated a minimum of 90 million people in the pursuit of man's noblest mission ‐‐ world peace. What intelligent person could call \"immoral\" any means used to accomplish this all important goal? [William Cooper: (laughs) Do you...do you think this guy is playing with a full load of bricks, here? I don't. And he continues:] In our great Humanist Manifesto signed in 1933 and 1973, we explain our moral creed which is very much the same as the Marxist creed, yet set forth in much more palatable and tactful terms. Here is a brief summation of our beliefs regarding Ethics and Truth: \"Moral values derive their source from human experience. Ethics is autonomous and situational, needing no theological or ideological sanction. Ethics stems from human need and interest. To deny this distorts the whole basis of life...We strive for the good life, here and now.\" ‐‐ [William Cooper: and that's from the] Humanist Manifesto II, [written and signed in] 1973. AUTHORITY AND TRUTH \"We reject those features of traditional religious morality that deny humans a full appreciation of their own potentialities and responsibilities. Traditional religions often offer solace to humans, but, as often, they inhibit humans from helping themselves or experiencing their full potentialities...We can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human species...Humans are responsible for what we are or will become. [William Cooper: Remember, folks, I educated you in the part of the Masonic religion, and the religion of the Rose and Cross, and the Knights Templar, and the Knights of Malta, the Red Cross of Constantine? All of these believe that man is in a state of becoming. Becoming what? Becoming gods. I continue:] Humans are responsible for what we are or will become. No deity will save us: we must save ourselves.\" ‐‐ [That's from the] Humanist Manifesto II, 1973. After 20 plus years of conditioning, our society now largely subscribes to this philosophy. Some of you who practice \"selective\" Christianity are closer to our faith than to the superstitions of the Bible Thumpers of old. (In selective Christianity, of course, you choose [certain portions of the so ‐ called Word of God] to believe in, and discard the parts that are not convenient.) Don't you see that in this we are just alike? Your \"faith\" is actually based on what is right under man's desire. We Humanists are in fact more honest. We admit that there is no God ‐‐ that it is only Man's desires that are important. You leaders of these \"selective Christians\" preach that your faith is based on some parts of \"God's Law\" but, in actuality the majority is based on what feels good or is convenient. [William Cooper: Now I must break here for just a second, folks, to tell anyone who may have just tuned in that these are not my words. If you're sitting there with your lower jaw on your chest, looking aghast at your radio, you are not listening to the thoughts of William Cooper or the Hour of the Time. I am quoting verbatim from a letter attributed to a police chief, and this letter can be found in Aid and Abet , a police newsletter, volume 2, number 1, in case you want to pursue this.] Quite obviously [I'm continuing now. Quite obviously], America's government now operates under the guiding principles of Humanism. Deception, lying, cheating, stealing, killing is all moral if it promotes the attainment of our essential goals. This is true righteousness. [William Cooper: Folks, I gotta stop right here and tell you: this is true bullshit. This is deception at its worst, for these people are actually believing that wrong is right and right is wrong. And that is exactly what we were warned about in these days. And that is what I warned you about in my book, Behold A Pale Horse . And I told you years ago that the belief of these people is that the ends justify the means, 273"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"whatever they might be. If they must kill two billion people to make their dream come true, they will do it. Mark my words: they will do it.] A prime example [I'm continue now. A prime example] can be seen in the recent war against Iraq. Over 250,000 have lost their lives so far, and more are dying every day ‐‐ all for the attainment of a higher good, the goal of our great Humanist leaders: WORLD PEACE through World Government. [William Cooper: You see, the writer of this letter understood what I understood about the Gulf War. It wasn't about Iraq taking Kuwait. It was in fact about the New World Order. George Bush even stated that. He said in our speech ‐‐ his speech I should say: \"Our fifth goal in the Middle East is a New World Order,\" though I would venture to say that he stated it as his fifth goal in order not to give it too much attention in the public eye. It was actually the first goal, ladies and gentlemen. I continue:] This New Age teaching is the reason why, for example, a police officer (one of Secular Humanist persuasion) is likely to risk his very life to save a member of society one moment and the very next moment take the witness stand and lie in order to win an important case. This is not to be considered immoral, given the particular standard of ethics upon which such an officer bases his morality ‐‐ namely, that the end justifies any means. (In other words again, the \"Higher Good\" principle!) Many people still do not understand this. They don't understand that this is why our presidents and their staffs, members of Congress and hosts of others with leadership roles in America ‐‐ lawyers, judges, etc. ‐‐ lie and cheat right alongside our dedicated humanist Law Enforcers. To repeat, all for the greater good of society, [or, in effect,] the system. [William Cooper: And I add outside the letter written by the chief ‐‐ if it is really a chief, ladies and gentlemen ‐‐ that all of these people belong to the secret societies. The ones who lie and cheat and murder. And I continue:] What the Masses must be made to understand, and never be allowed to forget, is that this is for their own good. They should know by now that those who are actually in control of our government (as Col. Oliver North explained) truly know what is best for the people. They must also know that under the New World Order, the Justice System's primary mission will be to protect the system from the masses. It is precisely in view of this that we on the inside have been obligated all along to use the system to suppress dissenters as quickly as possible ‐‐ before any radical Anti ‐ World Government, Anti ‐ Humanist group can gain the upper hand. [William Cooper: I must read that again, folks, for those of you who may be a little bit slow in understanding. And some of us are, especially with something that you can't quite grasp and never heard before. That's excusable. Again:] What the Masses must be made to understand, and never be allowed to forget, is that this is for their own good. They should know by now that those who are actually in control of our government (as Col. Oliver North explained) truly know what is best for the people. They must also know that under the New World Order, the Justice System's primary mission will be to protect the system from the masses. It is precisely in view of this that we on the inside have been obligated all along to use the system to suppress dissenters as quickly as possible ‐‐ before any radical Anti ‐ World Government, Anti ‐ Humanist group can gain the upper hand. You're aware of course, that the vast majority of Americans seek only peace and security. They hardly even realize that they have virtually made government their new god, to which they turn for the fulfillment of every need. Our New Age leaders (and we soldiers as their \"arms and legs\") stand ready to give the Masses all for which they pray. [William Cooper: And, ladies and gentlemen, I, William Cooper, and the Hour of the Time have warned you that if you don't wake up, if you don't change the course of the future, that you would get exactly what you want, and that you would be slaves in a New World Order. You see, to revert to the state of childhood means you must have a daddy. Some daddies aren't too nice, and even the nice ones restrict your personal freedoms until you reach the age of maturity. In this case, there will be no age of maturity, I can assure you. I continue with the letter:] Let me repeat: Our job within the Criminal Justice system today is to protect the PLAN, the SYSTEM, and punish those that our leaders decide are enemies of that System. [William Cooper: You doubted me when I said there was a plan, ladies and gentlemen? There is the verification that there is, in fact, a plan...an ancient plan. I continue:] Of course now, as with our Soviet colleagues, under New Age Humanist Situation Ethics, we are not limited in the methods we may apply to win. We can therefore proceed with unobstructed haste to make the masses safe and peaceful. [William Cooper: (laughs)] 274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Let's look again at our example of that police officer who routinely risks his life for others and yet will lie on the witness stand to help his government win some case in court. If some of you are still surprised at this then perhaps you haven't understood what I have been trying to convey. Nor have you understood what your children have learned so well over the last 20 years within the government school system. It is that we are living in a new age where man has wisely placed his trust in government instead of some superstition called the divine or God. It is the old religious morals that have caused all of our problems. A new age calls for a new belief system, a new moral code, a new religion. It is exciting to see most all of the religions of the world coming nicely together, united in preparation to serve the New World Order. [William Cooper: Remember, I told you that your religious leaders are not really on your side, and all the churches that belong to the World Council of Churches are all bring you closer to one religion, which will not resemble anything that Christ taught. I continue:] We must all dedicate ourselves to obeying our leaders without question and to the instruction of succeeding generations toward our Utopian goals of World Peace. I would like to introduce you to one present ‐ day scholar Dr. Sidney Simon, who has been very effective, and deserving of much credit [repeats: deserving of much credit] for his efforts in this work of re ‐ educating humanity. He speaks plainly and his meaning is unmistakable, as when he says: \"We do not need any more preaching about right and wrong. The old 'thou shalt nots' simply are not relevant.\" He goes on to explain to the child educators he is addressing that \"values clarification\" is a method for teachers to change the values of children 'without getting caught'. (Values Clarification is another term for Situation Ethics). A book in use by our educators called, Weep for Our Children , spells out \"values clarification\" as part of the new morality. [William Cooper: Listen to this carefully. This is a book in use by teachers, teaching your children, right this moment. It's called Weep for Our Children :] \"It's OK to lie. It's OK to steal. It's OK to have premarital sex. It's OK to cheat or to kill if these things are part of your value system, and you have clarified these values for yourself. The important thing is not what values you choose, but that you have chosen them yourself freely and without coercion of parents, spouse, priest, friends, ministers or social pressure of any kind.\" ===================================================== (end of quote) And that makes me very, very angry. That's one of the reasons my daughter is not in school and never will be in school. She already knows more now than most children twice her age from the home schooling that she gets. This is incredible. Don't go away. I have to take a breath. It makes me angry just to read this crap. (break music: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For , performed by U2) (music breaks ‐ William Cooper does a commercial for Swiss American Trading Corporation) (break music: continuation of I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For , performed by U2) Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to read the last paragraph again. I want you to hear this. Remember, this is a book in use by teachers ‐‐ educators ‐‐ called Weep for Our Children and it spells out values clarification as part of the new morality: [Continuing reading from Aid and Abet :] 275"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"(start of quote) ===================================================== \"It's OK to lie.

When the government national Child Care bill is passed it will be a great day for Humanists and proponents of World Peace. What wonders we can achieve once we have the attention of the nation's pre ‐ schoolers for 6 to 9 hours a day! Look what we have already accomplished with the older age groups of America's youth. As I hinted earlier, this new society, based on the deity of Man, will demand a new kind of Law Enforcer. [William Cooper: Remember I told you: they believe that man is in a state of becoming. Becoming what? A god.] [repeats:] As I hinted earlier, this new society, based on the deity of Man, will demand a new kind of Law Enforcer. One of our educators said to me some weeks ago, \"America's religious zealots of the past would be shocked at the changes the people have allowed.\" She was correct, for after all, it was James Madison that said, \"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future...upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to sustain ourselves, according to the Ten Commandments of God.\" Ah, but it is a new day, and we are fast proceeding into the 21st Century. Americans no longer wish to assume the responsibilities of governing themselves. Happily, for them, there is a whole new generation of very dedicated leaders and enforcers in government to see that they are cared for. [ENFORCEMENT MANPOWER] Let me address for a moment the question of Police manpower. As the citizens relinquish, out of fear, more of their rights, more Enforcers are required to regulate and supervise the people's activities so that they remain safe and peaceful. Who would have thought 100 years ago that the integration of fear of literally everything would have been the answer to establishing the New World Order? Credit for this innovation goes to the Free Thinkers of the last generation. [William Cooper: Now, folks, if you think he's wrong, just look at yourselves; look at what you put up with; look what you've allowed to happen; look at the state our nation is in; look at the fact that we've already lost most of the Bill of Rights and a portion of the Constitution known as the first ten amendments. You all file and pay income taxes but you are not required to file or pay. You do everything out of fear, and that's why you're known as \"the sheeple.\" Most of you; not all, but most, without any doubt. Most of you...that title fits like a hand ‐ made pair of Italian shoes. It's very comfortable, isn't it? Isn't it?] Now the older generation known as \"Peace Officers\", \"Servants of the People\", might not so readily have adopted, nor fit into, this new order of things. Fortunately, this has not posed too great a problem, due to the fact that they are rapidly being replaced through natural attrition, [in effect] death or retirement. [William Cooper: And now Hilary is running around the country, folks...wants to open a dialogue on euthanasia. Timely, isn't it? I continue:] The next seven or eight years will see the last of them removed. At the same time, police agencies are of necessity attempting more and more to screen out before hiring those prospective officers who believe in the old religious superstitions. This is wise because these zealots will not do the things that will be required of them under the new system. Those remaining police officers who openly profess a belief system steeped in old world Religious Fundamentalism, can be and are being phased out on any number of charges, such as can be substantiated over time or with the help of a little innovation on the part of new management. 276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: And we believe that this organization, Aid and Abet , may be the organ [sic] used to identify those police officers. I continue...before I continue, folks, we believe that and have good grounds to believe. However, we cannot prove it. You must make up your own mind yourselves. I continue:] Some of the \"old time\" officers complain that this type of job discrimination is \"unconstitutional and immoral,\" but we know they are wrong. Under Situation Ethics all things are moral as long as they promote the goal. Therefore they are not being removed for any evil cause; they are incompatible and simply non ‐ functional for the duties that will be required of them. [William Cooper: You might ask yourself, ladies and gentlemen: what are the duties that will be required of them? I think you've already seen some examples at Ruby Ridge and Waco, Texas and many other places. And I go on with the letter:] [SUPERVISING A HYPOCRITICAL PUBLIC] I feel I need to say again that if a professional police officer must lie against those who violate the Law, then it is moral. The same is true when government judges and attorneys withhold evidence and witnesses from the jury to win their cases. When a politician lies to win an office, or makes deals that promote the New Order, it is moral. Let me tell you what is truly immoral. I will use the issuance of traffic violations as only one example. True immorality is when 5 out of 10 \"good upstanding citizens\" take the witness stand, swear an oath to their God, and then proceed to fabricate lies to get out of their tickets. This our Enforcement Officers witness daily in court. To them this is not only immoral but highly hypocritical. The Enforcer's dishonesty helps society as a whole. If a government agent lied for personal reasons [then] it would be immoral; if done for the betterment of mankind, it is not. And that is the most important lesson I bring you today. It is one thing when a leader or agent of government has to lie or otherwise deceives his subjects. It is quite another when an ordinary individual from among the masses, \"bites the hand that feeds him\" by lying to those who are bringing salvation in this brave new world. Do we see this important difference? The Old World understood that it was the greatest of sins to lie to or deceive God. The generations of devotees that wish to enter the New World must likewise be brought to the understanding that it is the greatest of sins to lie to or deceive their new God, Government. Any such disloyalty would surely hamper the progress of those engaged in ushering in the glorious New World Order. [RESISTANCE TO THE NEW ORDER] We are not concerned with the few who may resist this New Order, for out of pragmatic necessity their fate has been amply allowed for in the Master Plan. What we are most concerned about at present is that the obedient masses be made to understand that it is detrimental to progress for them to suggest that their Supervisors wallow under the pressure and futility of the antiquated superstitions, morals and dogma of the past. There will be some difficult changes facing the person entering this New Society. On these issues, however, we can assure the people there will be no compromise. Thank you for listening. May the blessing of the New Order come swiftly upon us. So Mote It Be. ===================================================== (end of quote) \"So Mote It Be\" is taken directly from the initiation ceremonies of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and you will hear it nowhere else, ladies and gentlemen. Whoever wrote this was a highly degreed Freemason of the Scottish Rite. And he is under a pseudonym explaining the true purpose, the true religion and the true plan for the religion that those who frequent the lodge actually adhere to. So you see, in Aid and Abet , a police newsletter, volume 2, number 1, all of the police officers who subscribe to this newsletter are the good guys. The good guys. They have been delivered a warning from a police chief under a pseudonym which makes it very plain what will happen to any police officer who does not go along with the New World Order. And I say that it was intentionally that way. And that there is no police Chief Rupert Orpheus, pseudonym or not. But this is the policy that needed to be explained to all of these officers at once to hasten their decision. You see, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes right down to it, most people will do what they're told, when they're told if they're told, and they have been told. I hope that you are intelligent enough to understand what you have just heard, and exactly what it means. If you are not...if you are not, 277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"dear sheeple, God have mercy upon your soul. You're going to need it. Those long time listeners to the Hour of the Time; those who have been awake for quite some time; those who were never asleep, understand that there is a plan in the world that the members of the secret societies, by whatever name they call themselves to you, the profane, in their exoteric language, are using to bring about the ages ‐ old dream of a New World Order. For the masses are totally and completely controlled for each and every second of every moment of every hour of every day of their lives. And where the priests of the Mysteries govern in what they call a \"Council of Wise Men.\" The public at large will not know much about this Council of Wise Men, for there will be at the head of this Council a charismatic, religious, and political leader. This is necessary for the public needs somewhere to vent their emotions, their elations, their angers. And it makes no difference if they topple this leader from his throne. The real leaders will remain untouched as they have remained untouched throughout the history of the world. Those of you who really believe this hick, William Clinton, is leading this nation and making the decisions...you probably, at some point within the last 24 hours, thought you were Rush Limbaugh and sat on half your brain. And those of you who believe that you really have a choice at election time, when the choice has already been made, and it's especially damaging if you believe that your vote really counts, when it is the Electoral College that elects the president. And in fact, that's really not necessary, unless some ringer slips into the choice, like Gary Hart. Didn't you wonder why Gary Hart was completely and totally destroyed forever because someone photographed him on a boat with one woman, not doing anything wrong? And Bill Clinton is not even tarnished. Don't you understand? Bill Clinton is just a messenger boy. And if he gets impeached, it will not solve anything. And those of you running around signing petitions to impeach William Clinton had better read the Constitution of the United States of America. You see, you cannot impeach a president because somebody signed a petition. I don't care if 200,000,000 Americans sign that petition, you cannot impeach William Clinton, you fools! You must prove that he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and you must have solid evidence. And you must have witnesses that don't die overnight, and documentation that doesn't disappear by the time next week comes along. Do you understand?

La Traviata , the December 1993 issue. And I'm going to read this to you so that you'll know that I'm not the only one out here who's stark raving mad as some of you tend to think. I want you to hear that, not only...not only have I reached the conclusions that I have reached through years and years of diligent and very, very deep research, but many others have reached the same ‐‐ and I mean the very same ‐‐ conclusions. This is entitled, \"Secrets in the Vatican II: The Church and the Secret Societies, A Brief History.\" Pay close attention and, as always, ladies and gentlemen, make sure that you have a tablet and a pen or pencil by your side at all times when you listen to the Hour of the Time. (start of quote) =================================================================== At a recent Church of England Synod, a report on Freemasonry was presented to the assembled clerics and laypeople for debate. Several speakers denounced Masonry as contrary to the teachings of Christianity and condemned Christians, especially clerics, who might be members. One speaker even went so far as to attack Masonry as blasphemous because he claimed its central initiation ritual, which involves a symbolic death and rebirth enactment, was a travesty of the Christian belief of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. Since its inception, Freemasonry has been a target of Christian wrath. In the inner circle of Masonry among those who have obtained higher degrees of initiation there are Masons who understand that they are the inheritors of an ancient and pre ‐ Christian tradition handed down from pagan times. The medieval Masons inherited this secret tradition in the form of symbolic teachings which expressed spiritual truths. These teachings originated in the pagan mysteries which were followed [wildly]...widely [and wildly] in the ancient world. These medieval Masons inherited esoteric knowledge from their pagan forebearers and this knowledge was incorporated into the sacred architecture of the cathedrals. [William Cooper: Now, I want you to pay real close attention because during my series in the Mysteries, when I found out what was concealed within most of the altars that were built during those times ‐‐ and I related it to you over the air ‐‐ many people called me a liar. And you're going to hear verification of this ‐‐ what was found ‐‐ not only within the altars, but throughout these cathedrals. So pay close attention, folks. This is very important.] 279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"When the lodges of speculative, as opposed to operative, Freemasonry were founded in the 17th and 18th centuries, this knowledge was transformed into the symbolism which today forms the basis of Masonic ritual. With the persecution of alternative spiritual beliefs in medieval Christian Europe, the guardians of this ancient wisdom went underground, forming secret societies to preserve their pagan ideals, and these societies became the \"mysteries\". The two major secret societies which were formed in this period ‐‐ although they only revealed themselves in public form in the 16th and 17th centuries ‐‐ were Freemasonry and the Order of the Rosy and Cross. While the Order of the Rosy Cross, or the Rosicrucians, is still a secret society which has received little publicity in the modern times, considerable public attention has been drawn to Freemasonry recently. [William Cooper: (laughs) Oh, my.] The Masons regard geometry as the most important of the arts and sciences, according to their beliefs. Geometry has been taught by a pre ‐ flood patriarch called Lamech, who had three sons: one invented geometry, another was the first Mason, and the third was a blacksmith who was the first human to work with precious metals. In common with Noah, Lamech was warned of an impending flood caused by the wickedness of humanity and the interference of the fallen angels in world affairs. Lamech and his sons decided to preserve their knowledge in two stone pillars, so that future generations would discover it. The Masons believe that one of these pillars was discovered by the Greek god Hermes, also known to the Greeks as Hermes Trismegistus (or Thrice Greatest) and to the ancient Egyptians as the Ibis ‐ headed scribe of the gods Thoth ‐‐ pronounced Tehuti. The so ‐ called \"emerald tablet of Hermes\" is said to contain the essence of the lost wisdom from before the days of the biblical flood. According to occult sources, this tablet was discovered in a cave by the mystic Apollonius of Tyana, who was regarded by the early church as a rival to Jesus. The first published version of the Emerald Tablet dates from an Arabic source of the 8th century, A.D., and it was not translated into Latin in Europe until the 13th century. However, the myth of the Hermetic wisdom had a profound effect on the Gnostics who were heretical Christians in direct conflict with the early church for attempting to fuse paganism with the new Christian faith. They also claimed to possess the secret teachings of Jesus, divulged to only his inner circle of disciples. Masons claim these teachings were censored from the authorized version of the New Testament, which was approved by the Church councils, who met to decide the structure and dogma of early Christianity. In medieval Europe, gnostic philosophy emerged in the rise of the heretical Christian sect ‐‐ the Cathars ‐‐ and the rise of the Chivalric Order of the Knights Templar. The Hermetic traditions provided the spiritual inspiration for many secret societies in the Middle Ages, and its influence can be discerned in both speculative Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. In the Masonic tradition, it is said that Masons were first organized into a corporate body during the building of the tower of Babel. The concept of this tower was to reach up to heaven and contact God. According to Genesis 11:4 ‐ 6, the fall of the Tower of Babel destroyed the common language spoken by humanity and ended the Second Golden Age, which followed the flood. The architecture of the tower was King Nimrod of Babylon, who was a Mason. According to popular belief, the Hebrews received their knowledge of Masonry from the Babylonians and introduced it to Egypt when they were taken into slavery. In Egypt, this knowledge was influenced by the Mysteries and the occult traditions of the pyramid builders, who were versed in the techniques of sacred geometry. The key to the pagan origins of Freemasonry relies on the semi ‐ mythical story of the construction of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. This building was regarded as the repository of ancient occult wisdom and symbolism by both the Freemasons and the Knights Templar. To build the temple, Solomon imported Masons, artists and craftsman from neighboring countries. Specifically, he sent a message to the king of Tyre, asking if he could hire the services of the king's master builder, Hiram Abiff, who was killed in geometry ‐‐ who was skilled (laughs) ‐‐ who was skilled in geometry. (laughs) Solomon appointed Hiram as the chief architect and master Mason of the temple. Hiram completed the temple in seven years [the number is especially significant in the occult tradition and Freemasonry, folks]. But this achievement was overshadowed by his violent, mysterious death. Hiram was approached by three fellow Masons who demanded the secret of the master Mason's word. He refused, and was beaten to death. They buried him in a shallow grave. They mark the grave was an acacia tree. His corpse was discovered 15 days later. Solomon ordered that his body to be exhumed and be buried with a full religious ceremony and honors due a craftsman of his rank. Early Masons historians regarded Hiram Habit as a symbolic representative of Osiris, the Egyptian god of death and rebirth. In the third degree of Freemasonry, the candidate representing Hiram Abiff is raised from the death by a special Masonic handshake known as \"The grip of the lion's paw,\" of the lion's grip. In both Masonic and Egyptian Mysteries, the resurrected god is buried on a hill in a tomb, marked by a tree. In Royal Arch Masonry, the candidate for initiation is informed that the sacred name of god is really Jahbulon. This name has been deciphered as a coded reference to the two major gods of the Middle Eastern fertility cults, Osiris and Baal, combined with the Hebrew tribal God, Jehovah. In Masonry, God is also signified as the Great Architect of the Universe, signifying the importance of sacred geometry and also indicating that he creates nothing, but designs and builds from that which has already been created. The political aspirations of Freemasonry, revealed in their influence on the revolutionary movements and protosocialism of 18th ‐ and 280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"19th ‐ century Europe can be traced back to the myth of the Golden Age, during the reign of Osiris and Isis, and before the flood to the Babylonians and Hebrew myths of creation. Occult tradition alleges that Hiram Abiff was secretly member of an ancient society known as the Dionysian Artificers, who first appeared about 1000 B.C. when the temple at Jerusalem was being erected. They took their name from the Greek god and possessed secret signs and passwords by which they recognized each other; were divided in chapters (or lodges) ruled by a Master and were dedicated to helping the poor. They established lodges in all the Mediterranean lands and their influence spread as far east as India. With the rise of the Roman Empire, lodges were found in Central and Western Europe and in the British Isles. The Artificers were connected with another secret society known as the Ionians. Members of this society had settled in Asia Minor and were dedicated to the spreading of civilization, especially in its Greek form, to what they regarded as the barbarian world. Allegedly, the Ionians were responsible for the famous temple of the goddess Diana at Ephesus. Architects from this society, together with the Dionysian Artificers, traveled from Tyre to work on Solomon's temple. Later, the Artificers called themselves the \"Sons of Solomon\" and used his magical seal ‐‐ two interlaced triangles representing the union of the male and female energies ‐‐ as their trademark. The Artificers who settled in Israel founded the Cassidens, who were a guild of craftsmen skilled in the repair of religious buildings. [Now] this new sect was instrumental in the foundation of the mystical Jewish group called the Essenes. The Essenes became famous through the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In occult tradition, Jesus of Nazareth was an Essene, and there are connections between this group and the medieval Knights Templar. The Dionysian Artificers believed that the temples they built had to be reconstructed according to the principles of sacred geometry, which reflected the divine plan of God. They constructed religious buildings to represent the human body as a symbol of the universe. They also promoted the political idea of Utopia on earth, which was expressed in symbolic form. The hammer and the chisel of the Mason became the cosmic forces which shaped the spiritual destiny of mankind. The Roman architect and master builder Vitruvius, born in the first century, A.D., was influenced by the Dionysian Artificers. His theories formed the basis for the architecture of the Roman Empire, and with the rediscovery of the classical knowledge in the 16th century, also had an impact on the greatest architects of the Renaissance. Vitruvius' concept of the magical theater representing the microcosmos of the world, as a symbol of the macrocosmos of the universe, was repeated in William Shakespeare's famous phrase, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\" And in the naming of his famous theater, The Globe, it is claimed that Shakespeare was a Rosicrucian initiate who was probably familiar with these ideas. Others take it further and believe that the Shakespearian plays were really written by Sir Francis Bacon. In the Masonic tradition, Cesar Augustus is the patron of the Masons in ancient Rome, and is said to have been Grand Master of the Roman College of Architects. This society was organized into guilds with symbols based on the tools of their trade, such as the plumb line, the square, compasses, and the level. The college had initiation rituals involving the pagan myth of death and rebirth, which are familiar from the Egyptian Mysteries. A temple built and used by the college was unearthed at Pompeii, the city destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 71, A.D. Among the symbols discovered in the temple were the double triangle of Solomon, the black and white tracing board first used by the Dionysian Artificers, the skull, the plum line, the pilgrim's staff and the ragged robe. The black ‐ and ‐ white tracing board were later seen on the battle flag of the Knights Templars, and then again on the floor of the cathedral at Sharps, built by the Knights Templar. These symbols later emerge in medieval Masonry and also speculative Freemasonry. The traditions of the Roman College seem to have been passed on to the Order of Comacine masters, who flourished during the reign of the emperors Constantine and Theodosius in the 4th century, A.D., when Christianity was emerging as the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. According to legend, the Order was founded by ex ‐ members of the Roman College, who were forced to flee from the Barbarians. They set up their headquarters on the island of Comacine in Lake Como, and in 643 were placed under the patronage of the king of Lombardi, who gave the Order control over all the Masons and architects in Italy. The Comacine Order was divided into lodges ruled by Grand Masters, wore white aprons and gloves, and recognized each other by secret signs and passwords. The Order was responsible for the Lombardi and Romanesque styles of architecture, and can be seen as the link between architects and Masons who built the pagan temples and the master builders who erected the Gothic cathedrals of Western Europe in the Christian Middle Ages. There is evidence that the Comacine Masons traveled all over Europe, and according to the historian Beadie, even reached the Anglo ‐ Saxon England, where they built a church in Northumbria. Although the Masons who built the medieval churches and cathedrals were nominally Christian, the proliferation of pagan symbols and images in these ancient buildings indicates many of them were still pagans at heart. [William Cooper: And, folks, this is what I explained to you about the pyramidal structure of organization in these secret society [sic]. Those at the bottom may go to a Christian church and really believe that they are Christian, or attend other religions. But as they progress through the degrees of initiation, they are indoctrinated into the old pagan religions, and the old gods come back to them with vengeance until they reach the top. They are no longer Christian, they no longer worship Allah, or Buddha, or any of the gods or religious beliefs that they had before. They're all gone by that time, and that's the purpose. You see, those at the bottom were exposed all at once to what they would eventually learn through going up the degrees of initiation. None of them would stay long enough to get to the top. It is a process of slow, slow but sure, brainwashing, and it works very, very good.] 281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Pagan symbols found include Sheela na Gig. These are crude representations of the naked female form in the shape of a woman with spread eagle legs displaying their genitals. They have been identified as images of the pagan goddess of fertility, worshiped in Celtic times. Other carvings found in medieval churches depict monks and priests in sexual poses with wanton young girls, performing homosexual acts, or wearing the heads of animals. Even stranger examples of pagan Masonry can be found. Professor Gregory Webb of Cambridge University, England, in 1946, Secretary of the Royal Commission of Historical Monuments, and an authority on medieval architecture, at the end of the war was appointed by the British government to survey ancient churches in Southern England which had been damaged by the German bombing. In one of the churches he discovered that a Nazi bomb had dislodged the top of the altar, revealing the interior for the first time since the 14th century. Inside the damaged altar, Webb and his team discovered a stone image of a phallus [phallus, the phallus,in fact, of Osiris] which had been carefully concealed within the hollowed interior. At first Webb [at first]... [audio is cut off for a few seconds] ...they thought this discovery was unique, until he began to examine other churches. He found that virtually all [virtually all, ladies and gentlemen] of the pre ‐ Reformation churches built before the outbreak of the bubonic plague at the end of the 14th century, when church buildings ceased for a long period, had altars which hid fertility symbols, phalluses, which dedicated the Christian churches to the old pagan religion. [William Cooper: The phallus, for the religion of Osiris, which came from the ancient religion of Babylon, were the phallus representative, the generative force ‐‐ Baal, who was also known as Nimrod. So you always learn something listening to the Hour of the Time.] The public image of protective associations, using their powers to promote fair trade and business ethics, concealed the fact that the medieval society of Freemasons was a secret society with pagan origins. Clandestinely promoting radical political opinions (socialism), the occult initiates who were the real power behind the secret societies knew that to achieve their aim they had to use the political system, and in the 12th century they began to put their plan into operation. [William Cooper: It is known as \"The Great Plan\" or \"The Great work\". It is what is bringing the New World Order to fruition into the world.] The relationship between the Pope and the Grand Masters of the secret societies[, ladies and gentlemen,] was an explosive one. The Church regarded the members of the secret societies as spiritual anarchists, who were agents of Satanic conspiracy against organized religion. The Church saw them as competitors for their flock, the sheep. The Freemasons and Rosicrucians styled themselves as wolves and believed that the sheep belonged to them and were their legal and lawful prey. The Freemasons and Rosicrucians, on the other hand, also accused the Church of suppressing the true teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and many secret societies were fervently anticlerical. They plotted the overthrow of the Catholic Church because it opposed the old pagan religions and the Manichean heresy, from which these groups drew their spiritual inspiration. [William Cooper: Ah, if they only knew that the Catholic Church had already done it long ago, and that's why they feared the secret societies as competitors.] At first, secret societies were supported by the Church. When the Vatican perceived the secret societies to be a political and ideological threat to the Church, the climate of suspicious tolerance began to change, culminating with King Philip of France wiping out the Order of the Knights Templar in the 14th century. In the lodges of Freemasonry, in the actual orders of the Templars, they attribute the date of the execution of Jacque DeMolay by burning at the stake to the year 1313. Other references give the year 1314. The Council of Nicaea, convened by the emperor Constantine in the 4th century, rejected pagan beliefs [at least that's what they said] such as reincarnation, which were held by early Christians and presented Jesus as God incarnate rather than a human spiritual teacher. Our contemporary knowledge of the gospel of Mark dates back to 1958 when an American professor of theology, Dr. Morton Smith, discovered references to it in a letter by Clement, preserved in a desert monastery. According to Smith, the inner teachings of Jesus were passed by him to his disciples during the initiation rite, which resembled those of the pagan mysteries. Smith interprets the ritual communion meal practiced by early Christians as a pagan rite descended from the mysteries of Isis and Osiris. It was this esoteric interpretation of Christianity, which was accepted by the medieval secret societies, rather than the version offered by the Church. After a brief lapse to pagan worship during the reign of Julian, the Christian religion quickly reestablished itself in Rome. And under the emperor Theodosius (378 ‐ 395 A.D.) the worship of the old pagan gods was finally prohibited. The ideological battle between the Popes and the Roman emperors they created raged for several hundred years. The point where we can discern the beginning of these secret societies influence this power struggle was in the reign of Frederick II, crowned as Holy Roman 282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Emperor in 1215. With his death in 1250, the Holy Roman Empire collapsed. The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, in the first lodge in Carolina in the United States received its charter from Frederick of Prussia. For 20 years Europe was devastated by war until, in 1273, the concept of the old empire was revived with the crowning of a new Holy Roman Emperor, Count Rudolf Von Habsburg (meaning \"castle of hawks\") in Austria. For the next 300 years, under the patronage of the Vatican, the Habsburgs extended their empire throughout Europe based on their temporal power and the spiritual power of the Roman Catholic. =================================================================== (end of quote) [audio is cut off and music cuts in] (break music: Let's Twist Again , performed by Chubby Checker) Well, I just know you're all up there twisting all around the living room, aren't ya?

They're trying to convince us that times were no good during the 50's and the early 60's, and that's a lie. And those of us who lived during that period know that it was the best time in the history of this country for the common man. Everyone had work if they wanted it. The American dream was becoming realized by more people than ever before in the history of this country. And what's happening now? The American dream, just since that time, has disappeared, folks, for most young people. Unless they really strike it rich, or get into a profession that really jerks the money out of people's pockets, they have no hope of owning their own home for many, many, many years, if ever. Most people in every family now have to work, and the children are regulated...regulated to government ‐ controlled daycare centers. They are, in fact, occupationally orphaned as you struggle just to keep food on the table, and a roof over your heads, and be able to have a little bit left over for some recreation once in a while.

Put a little spice in your life. ...and I'm continuing with the article: (start of quote) =================================================================== The successful alliance between the Habsburgs and the Vatican was seriously weakened by the actions of one man, a crusading reformer who used the symbol of the rose and cross on his personal seal. He was the German monk Martin Luther. [William Cooper: When I reveal that Martin Luther was a member of the Rosy Cross, the Order of the Rosy Cross, and that his personal seal was the rose and cross, you should see the piles of letters I got from Protestants who blindly revere this man, without knowing anything about him, chastising me for revealing to them the truth. But, folks, you can write all the letters you want, you will always get the truth on the Hour of the Time. We may make some mistakes now and then and if we do, as we have always done in the past, I will come on the air, and correct those mistakes. But we never, ever intentionally give you anything that is untrue. Remember that. Martin Luther's personal seal was the rose and the cross. And he was, in fact, a member of the Order of the Rose Cross. Martin Luther, the man who many revere, was the founder of the Protestant (or protest ‐ ant) movement.] 283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The reformation, allegedly, supported by the Rosicrucians and other secret societies who opposed the Catholic Church, swept through Europe. This period of the reformation represents a key time in history, during which the relationship between the Church and the secret societies changed[...changed, folks]. With the Reformation, [you see,] the Church was faced with an enemy within, which it could not destroy without bringing down its own edifice. With the Reformation, the whole concept of organized religion in Europe was revolutionized overnight. And where there had been one church, now today there are literally tens of thousands ‐‐ all with different dogma, different interpretations ‐‐ all professing to be the only true church with the only truth and with the only claim to heaven. Ah, but if you only knew. Many think that the secret societies were instrumental in this revolution ‐‐ I can tell you absolutely for a fact that they were. Support from the Grand Masters was offered to the reformers because the Reformation was recognized as a means to weaken the influence of the Catholic Church in European affairs. In America, sad to say, much of the Catholic hierarchy has taken on this role in modern times. The Reformation, effectively, emasculated the political power of the Church. It laid the foundation for the Puritan movement, whose members fled religious persecution in Europe to found [sic] a new nation in the Americas, based on spiritual principles drawn from Rosicrucian sources. And all of our founding fathers were members of these secret societies. [William Cooper: And many people have also chastised me for making that claim, but it is easily proved...easily! The problem with most of you people is that you believe blindly what you are told and you never check anything. Many of you still believe that George Washington chopped down a cherry tree, and when his father asked him who did it, he told the truth. Well, that's all a lie, folks. There was no cherry tree. He never chopped one down. His father never asked him if he did, and I really don't know if he would have told the truth or not. Most politicians don't...most politicians do not.] It also provided an atmosphere of open ‐ mindedness which allowed the seeds of the Renaissance to flower, based on the best ideas of the pagan classical world. Although the Habsburgs would rule for another 300 hundred years until 1806, the Reformation destroyed any hope of a united Europe controlled by the Roman Catholic Church [until today]. Above everything else, the religious reforms of the 16th century marked the beginning of the period when the Church became determined to exterminate the secret societies which had weakened its power base. [William Cooper: I'm not aware that the Vatican has changed its policy one iota from this. In fact, its determination has doubled over the past 150 years, even though today the secret societies flourish in America, with only a wink from the American Catholic Church bishops. In fact, the Jesuit Society was formed to combat this from another secret order of the Illuminati, or the Alumbrados, in Spain. The head of this group was Ignatius Loyola who was, in fact, arrested by the Inquisition. He used his influence with powerful people to gain an audience with the Pope. He went in on his knees and walked out on his two legs with a papal Bull, granting him immunity from prosecution, from the Inquisition, from any king, queen, country or law, save one, the Pope, and he was to found a new order, the Society of Jesus, now known as the Jesuits. See, the oath of the secret society, which makes up a chapter in my book ‐‐ and you will see that they are sworn to destroy the Protestant movement and Protestants, wherever they could find them.] [repeats]: Above everything else, the religious reforms of the 16th century marked the beginning of the period when the Church became determined to exterminate the secret societies which had weakened its power base. The secret societies, though they claimed to follow the precepts of Jesus Christ, actually provide an alternative version of spirituality to their followers. They denied the divinity of Jesus Christ, they deny that he was the son of God, or was in actuality the incarnated God upon this Earth; that he died, or that he was resurrected, or that he sits upon the right hand of the throne of God. Instead, he has become an Ascended Master ‐‐ a Teacher ‐‐ and Christ has become an office, which anyone can attain. [William Cooper: You too, can become a Christ in the New World Order. They actually provide this alternative version of spirituality, and it is the foundation of what you know today as the New Age movement.] They allege that the Church had deliberately subverted the teachings of Jesus and teach that there are other sources of spiritual knowledge which are as valid as Christian belief and predated it by thousands of years. In 1738, the first papal Bull to combat Freemasonry was issued by Pope Clement the XII. This Bull threatened any Catholic who became a Mason with excommunication ‐‐ at that time, an extremely[, extremely] serious punishment. In fact, nothing worse could be imagined. In the 1870s, claims that secret societies such as the Illuminati were using Freemasonry as a cover for radicalism and revolution gave the Church fresh charges to level against the Masonic lodges. The climax of the Church's crusade to destroy the influence of Freemasonry came in the 19th century. In 1864, Pope Pius X condemned socialism and the secret societies in his Syllabus of Errors , which he published following an investigation of revolutionary activities in Italy. Every investigation has found that socialism emanates from the secret societies. Twelve months after the publication of the Syllabus , the Pope again condemned the secret societies, specifically attacking Freemasonry 284"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"as anti ‐ Christian, Satanic and pagan in origin. In 1884, Pope Leo the XIII issued a proclamation identifying Masonry as one of the secret societies working to establish Satan's kingdom on Earth. He also claimed that Masonry was attempting to revive the manners and customs of the pagans. [William Cooper: They have succeeded, and a visit to the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas will convince you of that. It has often been claimed that the ultimate objective of the secret societies was to infiltrate the Vatican and place their own man on the throne ‐‐ see my book for the outcome.] Some modern critics of the Roman Catholic Church, especially those with ultra ‐ traditionalists views, who have seen in the liberalization of the Church in the recent years proof that its hierarchy has been penetrated at the highest levels by agents of the secret societies who are working for its eventual downfall. At the celebrations in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi in 1986, which stressed the unity of all religions, the Pope participated in a multi ‐ religious prayer for world peace. Traditionalists were horrified to see the pontiff happily share a platform with a Tibetan lama, a Hindu Swami, a Native ‐ American medicine man, a Jewish rabbi, and a Mouri(?) high priest. It was noted that the unity of all the world's religions and the recognition that they all derived from the same ancient ancient source as the central philosophy of the secret societies. It is the goal of the World Council of Religions. It was the message of Pope John Paul the II in Denver, Colorado, dear listeners, and he replaced the last Pope who tried [ ‐‐ who tried ‐‐ ] to be a good Pope. He was murdered after exactly 33 days in office. =================================================================== (end of quote) Now, I read this from La Traviata ...

When I make a statement like that I always get letters, or people call if I open the phones and say, \"How can you make that statement, Bill, when you just told us that our founding fathers were members of the secret societies?\" Very simple, folks: read the writings of the founding fathers ‐‐ they will tell you themselves. This was a \"great experiment\" to see if man was capable of ruling himself, and if he was, this would be the culmination of the Great Work. But you will also find in their writings that they understood human nature better than any of us do, or probably ever will, for they knew...they knew that, with the keys built into the Constitution, we would give up our creator ‐ endowed rights and trade them for benefits from the State, thus relegating ourselves back into the old ‐‐ the old position of owned property. We would become indentured to the State for accepting these privileges. But they knew, that people did then as they do today ‐‐ except for a very few people who really understand and appreciate freedom and understand the responsibilities and the consequences that go along with it ‐‐ they understood that most people spend the first 20 years of their lives struggling to become responsible and to be accepted as a man or a woman in their own right, able to be responsible, strike out on their own, build a business, sign contracts. And once they discover the responsibilities and requirements that freedom demands, they spend the rest of their life trying to crawl back into the womb searching for a daddy...a daddy to take care of them. That's why socialism is so attractive to most people, ladies and gentlemen. It tells them they no longer have to be responsible, and in exchange for their freedoms, daddy the State will take care of them. Daddy the State will give them a job, Daddy the state will pretend to pay them if they pretend to work. Daddy the State will provide them with some sort of a hovel in which they can live, so they don't have to worry about paying the rent.

You should always have a plan B, and sometimes a plan C, and D and E, and sometimes even plan F. But tonight, we only have plan B. [reading from Babylon Mystery Religion , written by Ralph Woodrow]: (start of quote) =================================================================== The Mystery Religion of Babylon[, ladies and gentlemen,] has been symbolically described in the last book of the Bible as a \"woman arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.\" [The phone is...was...is not now. This is insanity ‐‐ absolute insanity.] \"And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH\" [and that's from Revelations, Chapter 17, verses 1 through 6]. When the Bible[, ladies and gentlemen,] uses symbolic language, a \"woman\" can often symbolize a church. The true church, for example, is likened to a bride, a chaste virgin, a woman without spot or blemish ([check Ephesians, Chapter 5, verse 27, and Revelations, Chapter 19, verses 7 and 8]). But in striking contrast to the true church, the woman of the text is spoken of as an unclean woman, a defiled woman, a harlot. If it is correct to apply this symbolism to a church system, [ladies and gentlemen, then] it [becomes] clear that only a defiled and fallen church could be meant. In big capital letters, the Bible calls her \"MYSTERY BABYLON.\" [Now,] when John wrote the Book of Revelation, Babylon ‐‐ as a city ‐‐ had already been destroyed and left in ruins, as the Old Testament prophets had foretold ([and you can find that in Isaiah, Chapter 13, verses 19 through 22, and Jeremiah, Chapter 51, verse 52]). But though the city of Babylon was destroyed, [folks,] religious concepts and customs that originated in Babylon continued on and were well represented in many nations of the world [William Cooper: and exist in secret right up to this very day]. [Now,] just what was the religion of ancient Babylon? How did it all begin, and what significance does it hold in modern times? How does it all tie in with what John wrote in the Book of Revelation... [William Cooper: ...if at all? How many of you were aware that the Iraqis have been busy for many years rebuilding the city of Babylon?] Turning the pages of time back to the period shortly after the flood, men began to migrate from the east, \"and it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there\" (Genesis[, Chapter 11, verse 2]). It was in this land of Shinar that the city of Babylon was built and this land became known as Babylonia [and] later as Mesopotamia. [William Cooper: Originally, it was a part of the Syrian ‐‐ the Assyrian, the Assyrian ‐‐ nation.] 287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"[Now here, here, ladies and gentlemen, is where] the Euphrates and Tigris rivers had built up rich deposits of earth that could produce crops in [great] abundance. But there were certain problems[, you see,] the people faced. For one thing, the land was overrun with wild animals which were a constant threat to the safety and peace of the inhabitants ([and you can check for reference Exodus, Chapter 23, verses 29 and 30]). Obviously anyone who could successfully provide protection from these wild beasts would receive great acclaim from the people [William Cooper: for all people in all times seek security]. It was at this point that a large, powerfully built man by the name of Nimrod[, Nimrod,] appeared on the scene. He became famous as a mighty hunter against the wild animals. [And] the Bible tells us: \"And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty HUNTER before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord\" ([Genesis, Chapter 10, verses 8 and 9]). [Now,] apparently Nimrod's success as a mighty hunter caused him to become famous among those primitive people. He became \"a mighty one\" in the earth ‐‐ a famous leader in worldly affairs. [In] gaining this prestige, he devised a better means of protection. Instead of constantly fighting the wild beasts, why not organize the people into cities and surround them with walls for protection? Then, then why not organize these cities into a kingdom ? [William Cooper: What a great idea.] Evidently this was the thinking of Nimrod, for the Bible tells us that he organized just such a kingdom. \"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Caleh, in the land of Shinar\" ([Genesis, Chapter 10, verse 10]). The kingdom of Nimrod is the very first [government] mentioned in the Bible. Whatever advances may have been made by Nimrod would have been well and good, but Nimrod[, you see,] was an ungodly ruler. The name Nimrod[, ladies and gentlemen,] comes from marad and means, \"he rebelled.\" [William Cooper: Sound familiar? Wasn't Lucifer an angel of light, with tremendous knowledge who rebelled against God, and was thrown down to the Earth to be the ruler of the material world? Well, the word Nimrod means \"he rebelled.\"] The expression that he was a mighty one \" before the Lord\" can carry a hostile meaning ‐‐ [you see,] the word \"before\" being sometimes used as meaning \"against\" the Lord. The Jewish encyclopedia says that Nimrod was \"he who made all the people rebellious against God.\" [William Cooper: That's taken directly out of the Jewish encyclopedia. Let me say it again for you, \"he who made all the people rebellious against God.\"] The noted historian Josephus wrote: \"Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God...He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God....the multitudes were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod...and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high...The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon.\" [William Cooper: And those who built it were called \"The Builders.\" And they still exist, ladies and gentlemen, today.] Basing his conclusions on information that has come down to us [throughout] history, legend, and [in] mythology, [a man by the name of] Alexander Hislop has written in detail of how Babylonian religion developed around traditions concerning Nimrod, his wife Semiramis, and her child Tammuz. [William Cooper: Now, Alexander Hislop wrote this ‐‐ the results of his research ‐‐ in a book called The Two Babylons . And I suggest strongly that you make every attempt to get that book and read it. It will open your eyes if you have an understanding of the symbology of the esoteric religion of Mystery Babylon and the secret societies today, which I have revealed to you through the Mystery Babylon series on this radio broadcast. It is important that we understand who these people are, and what they believe. It makes no difference whatsoever whether you believe it or disbelieve it. If they hold the powerful positions of the world, if they are pulling the strings that make you dance, then whatever they believe affects you. Make no mistake about that.] [Now,] when Nimrod died, according to the old stories, his body was cut into pieces, burned, and sent to various areas. [William Cooper: Sound familiar? We've discussed this same story before. You see, the first religion is also the last religion, and it has been every religion in between in various aspects and various forms. It has never changed.] His body was cut into pieces, burned, and sent to various areas. Similar practices are mentioned even in the Bible ([Judges, Chapter 19, verse 29; 1st Samuel, Chapter 11, verse 7]). [And] following his death, which was greatly mourned by the people of Babylon, his wife Semiramis claimed he was now the sun ‐ god [S ‐ U ‐ N, sun ‐ god]. Later, when she gave birth to a son, she claimed that her son, [spelled S ‐ O ‐ N,] Tammuz by name, was their hero Nimrod reborn. 288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: And this again has been played out throughout the mysteries, and throughout every religion throughout the history of the world. Now don't misunderstand me, ladies and gentlemen. I'm in by no means casting any slander or dispersion on any religion that any of you may be practicing. I'm making no suggestions that you should not be a part of whatever religion you belong to. I'm merely delivering a message of the truth to you all.] The mother of Tammuz had probably heard the prophecy of the coming Messiah to be born of a woman, for this truth was known from the earliest times ([and you can check Genesis, Chapter 3, verse 15]). She claimed her son was supernaturally conceived, and that he was the promised seed, the \"savior.\" [William Cooper: And she gave the first recorded virgin birth to her son, who was Nimrod reborn from his wife/lover/mother. Tammuz was the child's name, and he was called the promised seed or the \"savior.\"] In the religion that developed, however, not only was the child worshiped, but the mother was worshiped also! Much of the Babylonian worship was carried on through mysterious symbols ‐‐ [you see,] it was a \"mystery\" religion. The golden calf, for example, was a symbol of Tammuz, son of the sun ‐ god [Nimrod]. [William Cooper: The calf, or the bull, was actually the symbol during that age of the astrological house through which the sun was moving. It was called, and still is called, Taurus the bull. Later, when the sun moved out of the house of Taurus and into the house of Capricorn, then the golden calf became the ram, or the goat, and was worshiped in the temple of Mendes, and to this day it is known as the goat of Mendes.] [William Cooper: Now, every once in a while I slow down for you to make sure that this sinks in, that you really understand what I am telling you. For it is important, ladies and gentlemen, that we stop being deceived and led by our nose. Those who are the puppet masters rely upon us to remain puppets. It is my intention to bring you out of the toy box and into the real world.] Since Nimrod was believed to be the sun ‐ god or Ba'al, fire was considered as his earthly representation. [William Cooper: Fire was considered as his earthly representation.] Thus, as you shall see, [folks,] candles and ritual fires were lighted in his honor. [William Cooper: And the priesthood was known as \"the Philosophers of Fire.\" They had a habit of burning their enemies, and they still do that today.] In other forms, Nimrod was symbolized by sun images, [by] fish, [by] trees, [by] pillars [or obelisks], and animals. [William Cooper: For you see, if he was the sun ‐ god, he was the source of all life on this Earth. He was the source of all warmth. He was the source of all energy. He was the generative force, and his symbol was the phallus, or the obelisk. One was erected by our forefathers in Washington, D.C.] Centuries later, Paul gave you a description which perfectly fits the course that the people of Babylon followed: \"When they knew God, they glorified him not as God...but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an IMAGE made like to corruptible man, and to birds and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things...they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the CREATURE more than the CREATOR...for this cause God gave them up into vile affections\" ([Romans, Chapter 1, verses 21 through 26]). [Ladies and gentlemen,] this system of idolatry spread from Babylon to the nations ... [William Cooper: Do you know what \"nations\" translates to in the original Hebrew and Greek? It is the word we know as \"gentiles.\" You see, the nations are the gentiles. Does that surprise you? So, the gentiles were not corrupted until the system of idolatry spread from Babylon to the nations—to the gentiles. ...for it was from this location that men were scattered over the face of the earth ([and you can find that in Genesis, Chapter 11, verse 9]). And as they went from Babylon, they took their worship of the mother and child, and the various mystery symbols with them. [William Cooper: And the mother was known as the \"Goddess of the Sea\" at a later time. The sea was called the \"Mare\", and the goddess was called \"Mary.\"] Herodotus, the world traveler and historian of antiquity, witnessed the mystery religion and its rites in numerous countries and mentions how Babylon was the primeval source from which all systems of idolatry flowed. Bunsen says that the religious system of Egypt was derived from Asia and \"the primitive empire in Babel.\" In his noted work[, folks,] Nineveh and its Remains , Layard declares 289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"that we have the united testimony of sacred and profane history that idolatry originated in the area of Babylonia ‐‐ the most ancient of religious systems. And all of these historians were quoted by Hislop [in his book, The Two Babylons ] . When Rome became a world empire, it is a known fact that she assimilated into her system the gods and religions from the various pagan countries over which she ruled. Since Babylon was the source of the paganism of these countries, we can see how the early religion of pagan Rome was but the Babylonish worship that had developed into various forms and under different names in the countries to which it had gone. [Now,] bearing this in mind, [folks,] we notice that it was during this time ‐‐ when Rome ruled the world ‐‐ that the true savior, Jesus Christ, was born, lived among men, died, and rose again. He ascended into heaven, sent back the Holy Spirit, and the New Testament church was established in the earth. [William Cooper: Now, looking at those early days of the Christian Church, all of the members were saints. They were all equal unto each other — all of them. It must have been glorious to be a part of that, and break away from the old to something that gave a promise, a promise of a better life. You see, in those days life was terrible. It was uncertain at best. No one knew when they woke up in the morning if they would live to see the nightfall. And it was that uncertain every single day. And all of a sudden, there was a promise. There was a promise.] [You] only have to read the Book of Acts to see how much God blessed his people in those days. Multitudes[, ladies and gentlemen,] were added to the church ‐‐ the true church. [William Cooper: It doesn't exist anywhere today except in small pockets of individuals who meet with each other in Christ's name. All of these organized religions have bastardized the teachings of Christ ‐‐ have corrupted the teachings of Jesus. And most of them are helping to lead you into slavery in the New World Order.] [In those days,] great signs and wonders were performed as God confirmed his word with signs following. True Christianity, [ladies and gentlemen,] anointed by the Holy Spirit, swept the world like a prairie fire. [William Cooper: Nothing could stop it; no matter how many Christians the emperor crucified, no matter how many Christians were thrown to the animals in the Roman circus, one hundred fold sprang up to take their place.] [This movement] encircled the mountains and crossed the oceans. It made kings...tremble and tyrants [fearful]. It was said of those early Christians that they had turned the world [literally] upside down! ‐‐ so powerful was their message and spirit. [William Cooper: Now, I'm talking about the true Christian teachings of Jesus Christ, in the way that it was followed in the early days of Christ's Church ‐‐ not Rome's church, not Baptist's church, not Lutheran's church, not Orthodox's church, but Christ's Church.] Before too many years had passed...men began to set themselves up as \"lords\" over God's people and places of the Holy Spirit. Instead of conquering by spiritual means and by truth ‐‐ [William Cooper: By truth! Not too many people in the world understand what truth even means today.] ...as in the early days ‐‐ men began to substitute their ideas and their methods... [William Cooper: ...in place of the teachings that Christ gave us. The Inquisition came from these people, not from Jesus Christ. The Crusades came from these people, not from Jesus Christ.] Attempts to merge paganism into Christianity were being made even in the days when our New Testament was being written, [folks,] for Paul mentioned that the \" mystery of iniquity\" was already at work [...already at work], [and he] warned that there would come a \"falling away\" and some would \"depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils\" ‐‐ the counterfeit doctrines of the pagans ([2nd Thessalonians, Chapter 2, verses 3 through 7; 1st Timothy, Chapter 4, verse 2]). [And] by the time that Jude wrote the book that bears his name, it was necessary for him to exhort the people to \"earnestly contend for the faith that was ONCE delivered unto the saints,\" for certain men had crept in who were attempting to substitute things that were no part of the original faith ([check Jude, Chapter 1, verses 3 and 4]). Christianity[, folks,] came face to face with the Babylonian paganism in its various forms that had been established in the Roman Empire. The early Christians refused to have anything to do with its customs and beliefs[, and we all know what happened]. Much persecution resulted. Many[, many] Christians were falsely accused, thrown to the lions, burned at the stake, and in other ways tortured and martyred. 290"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: And for their own safety, they went underground in the catacombs, and in the caves, and they formed their own secret society which was known then as the \"Friendly Open Secret Society,\" and their symbol to mark their way was a fish.] Then, great changes began to be made. The Emperor of Rome professed conversion to Christianity... =================================================================== (end of quote) He had to, for Rome...Rome would have fallen just as sure, just as sure, as a tree in the forest falls to the axe, if he had not made that move.

We chose Swiss America Trading because we checked them out. We found out that they're good people—real good people. They're honest, they back up their guarantees, (and) they back up what they say. We have an agreement. If I think they didn't do somebody right, they make it right instantly, or they don't sponsor this program anymore. That's about the best guarantee that anybody on radio could ever give you. You see, I don't do anything halfway, folks. Whoever sponsored this program was going to invariably become attached to me. My name and theirs would be linked. Whether we wanted it to happen or not, they would be linked. Therefore, I had to have a sponsor that I could believe in, and that would offer our listening audience something that they needed, really needed badly. And you all need the services of Swiss America Trading to protect what you've worked all of your life to gain, against what is coming in our future. The New World Order, the actual legal aspect of it in the law, was established a long, long time ago. The only people who don't understand that the world government is already in place are the \"sheeple\" of the world. So as not to precipitate an armed uprising against them, they are acclimatizing you gradually to the fact that world government exists, that when there is a conflict between the Constitution and the United Nations charter, the United Nations charter shall prevail! You're being taught these things through television, through the movies. Children are being taught in school. In a way, where everybody knows something's wrong and everybody suspects what's going on, nobody really knows except the listening audience of this broadcast. Now, whether or not you ever purchase anything form Swiss America Trading, if you value what you hear on the Hour of the Time, you need to call them at least to thank them for sponsoring this program. If you do that, and mention my name, they'll send you several free newsletters and some other written material that you need to read. I would advise you strongly, very strongly ladies and gentlemen, to talk to them about making an investment in nonconfiscatable, nonreportable hard assets in the form of gold or silver or platinum. And I strongly suggest you do this as soon as possible, and set up a program where you can continue over the coming weeks and months, and hopefully a few more years, build up a reserve that you can use in time of great need. Call them. Do it now. 1 ‐ 800 ‐ 289 ‐ 2646. That's 1 ‐ 800 ‐ 289 ‐ 2646. You'll be glad. You'll be very, very glad, ladies and gentlemen, that you did. (continuation of break music: unknown orchestral piece) In those early days of the real Church ‐‐ the real Church, Christ's Church, who practiced exactly what he taught them ‐‐ great, great changes began to take place that have affected us right up to this very day. What a shock it must have been when Constantine professed a conversion to Christianity after stating that he'd seen the vision of a cross in the sky. And some accounts say that he didn't see it in the sky during daylight, that he saw it in a dream. And ladies and gentlemen, because he never accepted Christ during his entire life, and in fact was a pagan sun worshiper, I question whether he ever saw a cross at all. You see, because history says and records very clearly, that Constantine never accepted Christ as his savior. He never really followed the teachings of Christ. He was, in fact, a sun worshiper He 291"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"practiced the Mystery Religion of Babylon. But he was, in fact, the Emperor of Rome. Rome very quickly became, ladies and gentlemen, the Catholic Church, and the Roman Emperor became the Pope. He had to do this to save the Empire. The symbol of the Roman Empire, and the Emperor, was the double ‐ headed eagle. It signified that he ruled over both the east and the west ‐‐ that the sun did not set on the Roman Empire. This symbol still is displayed upon the walls of the Vatican. And just recently, Russia adopted this symbol as its national symbol. It is the symbol of the 33rd degree of Freemasonry. And I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on, but hopefully you get the point. [continuing reading from Babylon Mystery Religion , written by Ralph Woodrow]: (start of quote) =================================================================== Imperial orders, ladies and gentlemen, went forth throughout the [Roman Empire] that persecutions should cease[...simply and quickly cease]. Bishops were [created and] given high honors. The church began to receive worldly recognition and power. But for all of this, a great[, great] price had to be paid! Many[, many] compromises were made[, ladies and gentlemen,] with paganism. Instead of the church being separate from the world, it became a part of this world system. The emperor showing favor, demanded a place of leadership in the church; for in paganism, emperors were believed to be gods. [So] from here on, wholesale mixtures of paganism into Christianity were made, especially at Rome. =================================================================== (end of quote) We believe that the information that you're going to receive, and have received in fact over this broadcast, will convince you that what is known today as the Roman Catholic Church is nothing less than the old Roman Empire transformed. And the old Roman pantheon of gods became the pantheon of saints. And the Christian, who began as a Saint, equal with all of his brothers and sisters, became a lowly peon once again. The title \"Saint\" was stripped from him, and from her. And someone began to pass a plate, and put up collection boxes, and demand that at festivals the wealth of the people be transferred into the coffers of the church. [quoting from the book]: \"[Now, I don't] doubt that there are many fine [and] sincere and devout Catholics.\" In fact, I know there are. I know there are many devout, sincere, courageous, wonderful members of the Mormon Church, and the Baptist church, and the Lutheran church, and the Orthodox church, and even the Buddhist religion...and Hinduism. I've met these people all over the world. We have all, ladies and gentlemen, been deceived throughout our lives by the secular and the religious priesthood. And in many cases, they are the same. They're now engaged in a grand plan to bring about a New World Order. The Mystery schools ‐‐ they try to keep the mysteries pure ‐‐ want to rule the world through a council of elders, with a puppet, charismatic, religious, and political leader upon the throne of the world. And the Vatican wants the Pope to sit upon the throne of the world, and rule without the council of elders. You see, they all united in the efforts to bring about world government. The only point of contention is ‐‐ who is going to rule? And we're the odd card, the joker in the deck. For if we want to, we could decide that neither one of them will rule, and we could determine the outcome of this battle. And we could reinstitute the real Church again upon this Earth as it was when Jesus taught it. He did not teach us to war against our neighbor. He did not teach us to condemn or judge our neighbor. In fact, the commandment was \"judge not lest ye shall be judged.\" When Jesus spoke to a crowd and someone walked away from the crowd, he did not chase them down the road and try to stuff his teachings down their throat, ladies and gentlemen. He did not do that. Neither did he build great, wealthy cathedrals built of shining glass, with great pageants on the holidays, and big ‐ named stars to come and sing and perform in these pageants where a homeless person or a poor, unemployed man with dirty clothes would be turned away from the door. Jesus Christ would have been the first one that welcomed that person into the Church. And if you will look at the people that he habitually associated with, whose homes he slept in, who became his disciples, you will understand that those today who call themselves Christians do not even know the meaning of the word...do not even know the meaning of the word. Many, many of the ministers, pastors, who stand at our pulpits across this nation and preach the word of God on Sunday, attend the rituals of the Masonic lodge on the following Saturday and pay homage to Lucifer. How can this be? How can this be? [quoting from book]: \"[Now folks, it's not my] intention to treat lightly or ridicule anyone whose beliefs we may here disagree with.\" 292"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"I will be the first one to stand by your side and protect your right to worship at the altar of your choice any time anyone threatens to take that away from you, whether I agree with your method of worship, or your church, or your altar. For I believe sincerely that only by protecting your right to worship at the altar of your choice is my right to worship at the altar of my choice protected. Only by allowing you to speak what you wish to speak is my right to speak what I must speak protected. And everywhere I go, I see Christians who do not practice that at all, yet they claim to be Americans and support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and claim to be following the teachings of Jesus Christ, and they are not. They are false Christians. And I think that someday when they go to knock on that door that they're all looking forward to passing through, they will find that it is shut and barred and locked against them. I hope that this program tonight inspires people, regardless of their church affiliation, to forsake all the stupid dogma and silly interpretations and the fractures that have created thousands of different divisions of what is supposed to be one Church across this nation. Forsake the Babylonish doctrines and concepts and seek a return to the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints ‐‐ the real Saints, not, ladies and gentlemen, the Roman pantheon of gods. I hope tomorrow night to be able to bring the guest who was supposed to be on tonight. He may have called later, because the phone was ringing. But once I get into something, I carry it through to the finish. I cannot start something and leave it in the middle. I think tonight's message was important. It was important to me to be able to deliver it. This is not a religious program, folks. It's about lies and deception. It's about the truth. And the truth is very few people know the truth, or practice the truth. Most so ‐ called Christians spend most of their life calling Jesus Christ a liar. They've so twisted his teachings, his simple teachings. They've so turned around everything that is said. They so reach out to find verses in the Bible to promote their own agenda, whatever it may be. And all through the work they steal from their neighbors, and piously attend church on Sunday. And this must stop. It must stop. All of the lies must stop. All of the deceptions must stop. All of the manipulations must stop. We must begin to use our brains, tempered with our hearts, for cold reason is cruel and intrepid. Those who believe that there is no place in this world, or within humanity, for emotion are the despots of the world. Conversely, those who believe that the heart should dictate everything are the fools of the world. Man after all, as the ancients left us the symbol of the Sphinx to remind us, is nothing but an animal with a brain. And we spend most of our time in conflict between the animal instinct and the brain; between the emotions and desires and temptations and what we know to be right; between the forces of good, and the forces of evil. Too few of us are winning these battles, ladies and gentlemen. Too few of us really care. Too few of us really understand the golden rule ‐‐ do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Too many of us are fat, and lazy, and apathetic, and ignorant, pampered, spoiled, rotten. America must change. The change must occur in the people. The people must once again understand what is important and what is not. They must be willing to sacrifice. They must be willing to do whatever is necessary to make sure that the freedom that man has gained throughout his history, culminating in the greatest nation upon the face of this earth, does not disappear from the face of this earth in the name of some promised world Utopian government. For anything, ladies and gentlemen, that is created from a mountain of lies to sit up on top of a mountain of lies, is nothing but another mountain of lies. And as soon as the truth upon which this mountain is sitting is exposed, the entire thing will come tumbling down. A world brought about by liars through deceit and manipulation cannot be a good thing ‐‐ will not be a good thing. And those who are behind it, who profess to be doing what's best for man, who profess to be acting with the best intentions for the future of mankind, belie that statement when it comes out of the same mouth that promotes the lies that creates the deceptions that manipulates the people into it. For if it were going to be so good, no lies would be required, no deceptions would be required, no manipulations would have to take place. Now, all of you who are waiting for Jesus to come into His Kingdom, I tell you He is in His Kingdom now. The problems with this world lie with man, have always been with man, and will be with man no matter what he tries to create, no matter how he tries to create it. If it is built by man, it is flawed. The concept that we're going to have a perfect Utopian world government, where imperfect men are ruled by imperfect men, is ludicrous...absolutely, 100% ludicrous. I want to thank you all for putting up with my demented ravings tonight. I'm kind of glad that our guest didn't show up, because this is something that's been burning within me for quite some time.

(opening music: The Rose , by Bette Midler) [reading from A Rose Cross College ]: (start quote here): ================================= From the Rose Cross College , [which is] a resume of the teachings and proceedings of the Rose Cross College during its session held in the month of October, 1916, on the Four Hundredth Anniversary of the founding of the Order. The Imperialistic Council and Venerable Order of the Magi, its instructions and the Official Degree 'Priests of Melchizadek.' The 'Knights of Chivalry and Order of the Holy Grail', edited by R. Swinburne Clymer, October and copyrighted 1917, published at Beverly Hall, Quakertown, Pennsylvania: At the close of the June Convocation of the Rose Cross Order and Sacred College, it became evident that a Convocation of the Sacred College and Order of the Magi would be necessary in October in order to continue the work and commemorate the foundation of the Rose Cross Order, dating from the year 1516. On the second day of June, special letters of invitation were mailed to all members privileged to be present at the October Convocation, and arrangements started so that not only might lectures be given every day during the entire month of October while the College was in session, but that Ancient Degrees \"Sons of Osiris\" might be conferred as they had been during the month of June upon the delegates then present. Information had been received at headquarters from different sources that men, without any authority whatever, were using the name of the Magi; men who were not, and never had been, on the rolls of the Order. Acting upon this information it was considered best that special effort should be made to convene the Order during the Sacred College session and when convened the official degree \"Priests of 294"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Melchizadek\" should be conferred upon all who were eligible. During July it became evident that if the work, in several large cities, were to go forward, leaders should be officially ordained. With this in view, the following notices were mailed to the members [of] the Royal Fraternity Association, Incorporated. [Headquarters, August 2nd, 1916.] My Dear Brother, In accordance with the power vested in me as President of the Royal Fraternity Association, Inc., and at the request of the Order of the Illuminati, Degree \"Knights of the Rose Cross,\" I herewith invite you to be present at a special sessions of the Association to begin October 1st and end October 30th, 1916. At this special session of the Association, a convening of the Sacred Rose Cross College shall be called, and besides the regular work of the College when in session, the special work of ordaining two members of the Fraternity, namely, Mr. Charles C. Brown, Buffalo, N.Y., and Mr. A. W. Witt, Kansas City, Mo., in accordance with the provision in the By ‐ Laws of the Corporation, to wit: \"This Incorporation shall have the power to call a Convocation at any time, and when so convened, shall have the power to select teachers, and to ordain such teachers to the ministry, as shall in their opinion, be fitted for the position. And such ordained men shall have the power and the right, to officiate at weddings and at funerals, and possess all such other powers as ministers of God usually possess.\" In accordance with the laws, made and provided for in our Corporation, we issue this invitation that you may be present. God be with you. Fraternally yours, (Signed) R. Swinburne Clymer, President. All arrangements having been completed during the months of July, August and September, the delegates began arriving on the last day of September, and on the first day of October nearly all had arrived who were to be present during the first session. On October the second, the Sacred College was called to order and lectures being given in the forenoon, afternoon and evening of each day, by those who had prepared papers. Before the morning lecture a private session was held, presided over by Charles C. Brown of the Buffalo College, and conducted in the manner of the private classes at College in Buffalo, N.Y. On the evening of October 11th, all the delegates repaired to the 'Grove of Osiris' where the three degrees \"Ancient Mysteries of Osiris\" were conferred upon those delegates not previously initiated. The music, especially prepared for the entire ritual, being furnished by Miss Daisy T. Grove of Buffalo, N.Y. After these ceremonies all repaired to the Hall where a dinner was served to all. On the night of the twelfth of October, the delegates met in the Rose Cross Chapel, and after the Imperialistic Council and Venerable Order of the Magi had opened in due form and finished its official business, the official degree \"Priests of Melchizadek\" was conferred upon all those present. Following the conferring of this degree, the Council closed, and a special official session of the Royal Fraternity Association, Incorporated, was called to order. 295"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"After the opening of the business session of the Association, the official letter, mailed to members, was read by the acting Secretary, Miss Vera H. Barr, and approved by officers and members present. It was then moved and seconded that Mr. A. W. Witt of Kansas City, Mo., should be ordained to the Ministry, in harmony with the Corporate powers. Mr. Witt was called upon to make his confession of faith and allegiance to the Church of Illumination, and to read the thesis prepared for that purpose. The ordination in due form followed. After the ordination of Mr. Witt, the following resolutions, passed by the officers of the Corporation in special session on March 10th, 1916, were officially approved by all members present: \"First. Because certain people without authority from this Corporation, or from the true Rose Cross Order long established in America, [(x)] have started organizations, calling themselves Rosicrucian, but without any Rosicrucian teachings and directly in conflict with Rosicrucian laws and usages, it has become urgent that the Royal Fraternity Association shall issue a certificate of membership, good for one year, to every student who enrolls with any one, or other, of such Orders or Fraternities. \"The fee for such membership certificate shall be twenty ‐ five cents, to cover cost of issue and clerk hire. \"At the expiration of one year the holder thereof shall make application for a new certificate. All such certificates shall be on record in the office of the President of the Corporation. \"Any student, expelled from the Order, makes void his certificate, unless re ‐ instated. \"Any member of anybody in fraternal relation with the Royal Fraternity Association, may (on the payment of a fee of twenty ‐ five cents) have a certificate issued to him, recognized by the fraternities affiliated with this corporation. \"These rules are to go into effect immediately.\" It is regrettable that such rules and regulations are necessary. Not less than six different associations have sprung in existence, calling themselves Rosicrucian, without a shred of Rosicrucian teachings, and three other associations, calling themselves Magi or Melchizadek, without any authority of any Magi, and all of them years after the institution of the legitimate bodies. Furthermore, when six members of the Black Brotherhoods have enrolled in the true Fraternities within a year, to gain secrets to be used by the Black Brotherhoods, we realize the importance of strict rules. For this reason the Royal Fraternity Association, as a protecting body, became a necessity. Following the session of the Imperialistic Council of the Magi and the session of the Royal Fraternity Association, a midnight dinner, the October \"Feast of the Gods,\" was partaken of by those present. On the night of October 13th, after the opening of the official session of the Corporation, the following resolution, voiced by the Chairman, and seconded by Rev. A. W. Witt, was passed: \"Under the Royal Fraternity Association, during the Convocation of the Sacred College, that the order of the Knighthood, known as 'Knights of Chivalry, Order of the Holy Grail' be reinstituted. That at this meeting on Sir Knight should be created by the Grand Sir Knight, and that this Sir Knight should select his Lady for the coming year, and that during the year following this Sir Knight should select men either within or without the Order; that at the next June Convocation of the Sacred College such men, selected by him, and not more than nine, attend the Sacred College Convocation and be created Knights, those in turn to select their ladies, wither from within or without the Order, but from within if possible. Only men of the highest standing to be selected; men of the highest moral character, men chivalric towards womanhood. Each man must study, and be familiar with, the 'labors of Chivalry' legends of the Holy Grail, or Holy Grail, and the Golden Fleece. \"After the first year that a certain number of men, worthy of the honor, be selected, also ladies to the same number, the total of men Knights not be to exceed one hundred and ninety ‐ nine during the first seven years. \"That the first one to be selected and created a Sir Knight be August Rhu [William Cooper: spelled R ‐ H ‐ U], M.D., of Marion, Ohio, because of high attainments in his profession and the favorable aspects of the Heavens to his nativity, and of the Prophecy made by those who know . \"Biography: August Rhu, [(Roux)] Marion Ohio.

On the fifteenth day of October, the first session of the Sacred College came to a close and the delegates returned to their homes. The officers remained for the second session. The second session of the Sacred College was called to order on the sixteenth of October, at which time the delegates had arrived for the second session. Lectures at once began and continued the rest of the month. On the evening of the seventeenth of October, those present repaired to the 'Grove of Osiris' and had conferred upon them the \"Ancient Degrees of Osiris\" in like manner as that conferred upon the delegates of the first session. The midnight dinner, \"Feast of the Gods,\" followed the conferring of the degrees, followed by the usual social session. On the night of the eighteenth of October, the delegates and officers repaired to the Rose Cross Temple, and after the Imperialistic Council of the Magi had come to order, the Ancient Degree 'Priests of Melchizadek' was conferred upon them. After closing the Temple in due form, and official session of the Royal Fraternity Association, Incorporated, was called to order. Charles C. Brown of Buffalo, N. Y., was brought before the session and requested to make his confession of faith and allegiance to the Church of Illumination and read his thesis. He was then ordained to the ministry in due form. After Mr. Brown had been ordained and the business of the Corporation brought to a close, a dinner was served to those present. Lectures continued thrice daily, which a special session each forenoon led by Rev. C. C. Brown, until the night of October 24th, when word was received that Joseph A. Walter 32 degree of the Buffalo, N. Y., Consistory A. A. Scottish Rite, a Brother of the Order \"Fraternity Sons of Osiris,\" would arrive that day. On his arrival the Imperialistic Council and Venerable Order of the Magi convened and Ancient Degree \"Priest of Melchizadek\" was conferred upon Mr. Walter, followed by the official dinner in his honor. Of the lectures give during the month of October, only a limited number can be given in this book. The dedication service to the used in all ceremonies of ordination to the ministry in the Church of Illumination, was prepared by the writer some years ago, and symbolic of the Path taken by the Neophyte desiring to reach Illumination.

They have been scammed and they are part of an attempt to destroy the United States of America and bring the world, once again, under the rule of Great Britain. So you had better pay attention. The doctrine...the doctrine of Christian identity, ladies and gentlemen, and of the British Israelite stem directly from the mysteries. It is one of the biggest scams that have ever been put across to the American people and all you who are taking part in it. All you who are taking part in it are, for all intents and purposes, calling Jesus Christ a liar. You are also helping in a great plan to destroy this great nation and bring about a one ‐ world totalitarian socialist government upon the face of this earth. And if you listen carefully and take notes, and if you go to the sources that we give you, you will discover this on your own. And if you study your own history if you are of Aryan or Anglo descent, you will discover there is no Hebrew root in your language. You will discover that your ancestors were primitive, fierce, terrible tribesmen, who indulged in human sacrifice and worshiped the sun in temples such as Stonehenge. And if you're smart...if you're smart you will join with all those people in the world who want freedom, irregardless [sic] of their race, color or creed. You will stop buying in to the Hegelian dialect of divide and conquer, in which they separate us, feed us lies and send us off to kill each other while they place the chains about our ankles. Don't go away, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be right back after this very short pause. (break music: partial audio ‐ live recording of a female speaking) Well, if you think that's not important or has any bearing on what you're hearing, ladies and gentlemen, continue to listen. Take the doctrine out of your head that you don't want to hear the facts, because you already know what you believe. Take the pin labeled, \"Archie Bunker,\" off of the front of your shirt and throw it in the trash can, and pay attention and get smart and wise up. Stop being sheeple. The Order of the Holy Grail. [continuing reading from A Rose Cross College ]: (start quote here): ================================= Few people are acquainted with the fact that the flower of manhood in France and England belong to knighthood founded ages ago, their object being the recognition of, and the homage due, womanhood. These Orders bear the names of \"Knights of the Garter,\" in England, whose insignia is the Garter, and \"Knights of France,\" represented by the Fleur ‐ de ‐ lis . 298"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Both these Orders were founded [ladies and gentlemen] by men belonging to an older and nobler Order, \"Knights of the Holy Grail,\" who took advantage of a trivial circumstance to establish these Orders for the protection of womanhood. Though the Knights were in search of the Holy Grail, (their own soul) they were ever ready to fight for their country, for womanhood, and the sacred Mysteries. Other Orders, dating back many periods of time, under different names and emblems, entertained the same high ‐ minded, chivalric motives. The motto of the \"Knights of the Garter,\" \" Honi soi qui mal y pense, \" translated reads, \"Evil to him who evil thinks.\" This phrase fell from the lips of Edward III, as he pinned the garter (guard ‐ her) to his arm. To the initiated, this motto takes on a deeper meaning. In its most exalted purity, it was used by Knights centuries before the Christian Era. The garter is a feminine emblem, supposedly unseen, unless by accident. A mishap to a noted Countess caused the garter to become the insignia of one of the great Orders in history. The greatest movements of an age often appear accidental. The Fleur ‐ de ‐ lis is also an emblem of woman, and most of the symbols of the present, and earlier ages, are characteristic of the \"eternal feminine.\" Centuries before Jesus walked the earth, members of sacred and honorable Orders held the lignum sacred. In time the lignum worship became degraded, not by the members of these Orders, but by the people who came to understand something of the outer mysteries, and degraded them. The faith of both Christian and Catholic devotees is symbolized by emblems of sex. The Christian cross indicates the male, and the heart, that of the opposite sex. Both cross and heart are creative, or Phallic, emblems. There is nothing greater or higher in the Universe of God than creative power. The power that can create can also recreate and regenerate. If we honor the Creator, why not the created, creation? All the wisdom ‐ philosophy underlying the Knights of the different Orders, and the mythologies, was based upon creative power. Probably the most beautiful and purest of mythological stores, is that of Eros and Psyche, the story of the Soul and its earth career. As all Sir Knights are expected to read mythology, it is not necessary to give details, but simply call attention to the esoteric meaning of this supposed myth. Aphrodite, (Venus), they fairest queen in the Greek Heaven of the Immortal Gods, was subject to pride and jealousy, and demanded homage because of her sex and beauty. Psyche, (the Soul) untainted by sin, was possessed of a beauty far more attractive and compelling than the mere physical beauty of Aphrodite. The inference is plain. They were rivals. In her innocence, Psyche worshipped Artemis, (purity) the deity of virgins. She had no desire to attend the festivals of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, because she knew not of love and beauty. This gave offence, not only to the priestess, but to her parents as well. The parents, called by us temptation, which is the beginning of all knowledge, induced her to appear before the goddess in all her purity and innocence. The worshippers fell down before her. Such obeisance to another beauty roused the anger and jealousy of Aphrodite, who vowed vengeance on the radiant Psyche. Not having sinned, only listened to temptation, Psyche was really not subject to punishment. The Soul that listens to the voice of the flesh, is not necessarily punished for that which follows but, because of passive resistance, it permits itself further temptation. Aphrodite, symbol of earth ‐ mother and procreation, resented the adulation bestowed upon innocence. If the worship of men turned from the priestess of love and passion to that which was chaste and immaculate, how could she people the earth and there ‐ by obtain new worshippers. Brooding over this condition, she called her son Eros, (Cupid), the God of Love, that beautiful emotion which enters into the heart of all created things, and bade him seek Psyche and arouse in her the desire of love and passion. She commanded him to keep himself inviolate, not taking into consideration the great law of the universe which demands a just return for all things given or received. Eros, God of Love, the Law of Love itself, retired to do his mother's bidding. Meanwhile, Psyche was lamenting the fate of her loneliness. The maidens about here were being taken in marriage, which she, the fairest, was left uncourted. Like the soul that listens to temptation, she had become an inhabitant of the realm of unrest and longing. No longer single ‐ minded in her worship of Artemis, she was not yet possessed with the desire of love and passion, that state of feeling that would transform the worship of the gods into a longing to possess her. Eros was commissioned to bring this about. The temptations not resisted in the life of the soul, bring about the unhappiness to which it is subjected. But, at the same time, it is the 299"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"fate of temptation to bequeath knowledge to the soul. Obedience to the tempter results in wrong ‐ doing and sorrow, but it opens the way to wisdom and light. Before the edict of Aphrodite could be carried out, she decreed that Psyche should leave the abode of the gods. When the soul, in its untried purity, listens to temptation, it closes the doors of heaven against itself and must then prepare for its journey earthward. Death is its portion or, as Psyche was told, she would espouse a monster. When the soul first comes within the influence of the earth ‐ life, it is not conscious of the restrictions of matter, nor the laws that confine it there. Psyche awoke to a new existence. To her surprise she found herself surrounded by a realm of beauty, with the promised monster nowhere in sight. But her happiness, her content was of a passive nature, for though banished from the heaven of innocence, she was not awakened to the power and thralldom of passion. Not having actually sinned she was not in possession of the knowledge of self. She heard the call of love, but saw no form. In answer to her question, Eros answered that it was Love, her husband. The perplexed Psyche could not be satisfied with mere assurances of love. The insistent call of the imprisoned soul of knowledge, though all the senses, demanded recognition. She must see love . Love without passion does not satisfy mankind. It is a state of feeling, undemonstrated. The urge in man must know, see, feel and possess. Eros informed Psyche that, because of an unalterable decree, she would never behold his face. Only in darkness could he come to her, only in secrecy could she know his embrace. To accept love as it is offered, to live surrounded by love, with thoughts unmixed with doubt or suspicion, would life the soul to the heaven of happiness and immortality. Man, in his attempt to dissect and analyze, opens the way of grief and pain, worry and fear, doubt and misfortune. As darkness falls, or as the soul sinks deeper into the realm of matter, it feels the presence of unseen shapes about it. Fear contends with Love, which passion awaits nearby. But Eros, Love, makes himself heard through the veil of flesh, and whispers: \"Fear not, though the darkness of night surround thee, (flesh covering the soul), I am with thee. My love shall sustain and protect thee. No matter where thou goest, to heaven or hell, thou art mine, my beloved, as I am thine, for I am Love, the delight of the world, the giver of life.\" With love in the soul there is nothing to fear. When the soul is supported by love, evil is powerless. Love not only gives life, not only bequeaths youth, health and strength, but moulds and perfects mankind. As Psyche received Eros, Love, a thrill of joy passed through her. She opened her arms to the tender form of the lovely youth, and cried: \"Who art thou that takest pity on one doomed to be a sacrifice to the most terrible monster of the demons of hell?\" Eros answered: \"Fear not the monster of whom the oracle spoke. I am thy husband. I am he before whom both gods and fiends have reason to tremble.\" Love, supreme, is the husband of the Soul. It may lead its spouse to the innermost shrine of heaven; its shadow, lust, may lead to the lowest round of hell. So often mistaken for love, lust roams the earth, seducing, betraying, destroying womanhood. This unspeakable evil was the demon, the dragon, the monster for which the Knights of the Grail were banded together to slay. Psyche, still fearful, replies: \"Why, it thou art death, that fearful ruler of the land of shades, whom even the mighty Zeus dreads, why comest thou in so pleasing a disguise? Thy voice is music, thy breath the perfume of roses, and the touch of thy lips enraptures me. What shall I call thee?\" The answer of Eros, \"Call me Love,\" is a light set in the midst of darkness. Love diddipates the blackness and unreality of death, disintegrates carnal, sensual desires. The love ‐ encircled soul is able to resist destroying passions. It slays the dragon in its sacrifice to gain that which is real. Interpreted in another way, Death, in the pleasing disguise of reward and release, kisses the lips of the weary, bids the Soul fear not, and liberates it from the thralldom of earth. Love presides at birth, for through it the Soul descends to earth and its consequent experiences and lessons. Love presides at death, for through it the Soul ascends to freedom, peace, joy. \"O Love and Death, O Death and Love, How wondrous kin ye are! The Planet Venus thus at once 300"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Is evening and morning star. \"O Love and Death, O Death and Love, Life ended, Life begun. The sun may rise, the sun may set, 'Tis still the self ‐ same sun. \"Life's problem here at last is solved. Step in: the door's ajar. \"O Love and Death, O Death and Love, How wondrous kin ye are.\" Psyche and Eros lived happily together, even tho the strangeness of life caused her momentary fear. The Soul, surrounded by the darkness, the unreality of earth, seems bound to question the promises of Love. Still, unless haunted by the phantoms of doubt and suspicion, the Soul retains a general state of peace and happiness. But as time passed, the variety and newness of love waned. Doubt and suspicion became easy to entertain. Eros granted Psyche entire freedom in the selection of her guests, stipulating only that he be not questioned. The generosity and goodness of Eros roused the phantoms to a more spirited action. They urged her to insist upon knowing whom her husband really was. Surrounded by secrecy, how did she know that he was wholly hers. Could she depend upon him to supply her every need? With these questions and inferences, they opened the door to the most deadly of the phantom sisterhood, jealousy. The carnal mind, insisting upon proofs that can be seen and felt, refuses \"unseen verities.\" Mind, immersed in materiality, prefers a chaos of fact and objectivity, to a cosmos of harmony and beauty. Eros, noting the perplexity, uncertainty, and unrest of Psyche following the visits of the fiends disguised as friends, warned her. \"I beseech thee to be on thy guard, not only for the sake of our happiness, but because of the child, Immortality, thou shall bear me. If thy guests importune, torment and worry thee to discover my identity, and thou succumb, I shall leave thee. It is beyond my power to oppose the will of the gods.\" Psyche replied that with him near, happiness enveloped her; his touch filled her with aspiration and trust, his voice, as wings of faith, lifted her to the realms of peace and security. But often she felt alone, and the group of sisters, tho ugly, entertained her. It came about that inquisitiveness and fear were added to the brood that daily haunted the heart Psyche. Surrounded by their influence, Eros has helpless. Tho possessed of the power of the gods, Love cannot dwell in the heart of suspicion. At last, unable to resist the combined influence of the demons, Psyche was persuaded to take her lamp, steal quietly into the chamber of Eros and gaze upon the face of her beloved. As it lay revealed, a drop of oil caused him to awaken. At the instant of revelation, beholding a being of wondrous youth and beauty, she knew her fears, doubts and suspicions to be groundless. At the moment of realization that she had possessed all that heart and life could desire, because of a broken law, it was taken from her. The fiend of disobedience had completed her undoing. \"Psyche, Psyche, thou hast betrayed me. Now must I leave thee. Alone shalt thou suffer from the intrigues of thine enemies.\" Eros and Psyche parted. Love and Soul were divided. In other words, Soul because of questionings, unbeliefs, doubts, unrest, severed itself from the heaven of faith, peace and happiness. This is the story, (and the reason) of the pilgrimage of the Soul on the earth ‐ plane. How often is this story repeated in the homes of thousands today. Faith, security, happiness, bartered for doubts, suspicions, jealousies. Psyche, adrift, despairing, was bereft of all things but hope. Having discovered the destructive power of evil thought she turned about to win back the love, the heaven, she had forfeited. To human justice, it would seem that now Aphrodite, (Divine Law), would relent, having witnessed the undoing of Psyche. Not so. The pain and suffering and longing of Psyche could in no wise mitigate her punishment. \"Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\" To have reinstated Psyche among the gods would presuppose a power greater than Law which could nullify, or soften, its own edicts. Law is not annulled when all is lost through disobedience. Through pain and travail does one gradually win back their lost estate. Psyche called upon all the gods to aid her in recovering Love. Her prayers and supplications failed to reach that high heaven, for a broken 301"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"law becomes an impenetrable wall between an entreaty and its fulfillment. Hera, wife of Zeus, Queen of Heaven, and knowing all things; that goddess who dwelt near earth and presided over married life, pitied Psyche, saying: \"Would that I could present thy petition unto Zeus, mighty ruler of all men. That cannot be, for the word of Aphrodite is powerful, and her decrees inviolable. Thou hast brought about this, thy fate. Endure the trials that shall come upon thee. Believe thou shalt dwell again in heaven. Work out thine own salvation.\" Psyche, whose one desire was to recover the delight and happiness of the past endured the trials, accepted the punishments, passed the tests imposed upon her. As the reality of the statement became apparent to her, that \"To the Soul without love, all is empty and hopeless,\" she turned, as to a friend, to the god of death, that monster whom she had most dreaded, and begged him to take her to the realm of Hades. The performance of that journey was the extreme penance for disobedience. In the willingness to suffer death; in the willingness to be purged of all sin, she brought about her release. She had paid the uttermost farthing. Hearing of the voluntary journey of Psyche that she might regain Love, Eros flew to her assistance, liberating her from the Stygian slumber, awaking her to life, and love, and youth. \"Ah Psyche, thou almost perished to atone for my fault. Knowest thou not that only the gods can pass and repass the River Styx? To them it is a fountain of youth, but if mortals drink of it, it binds them to the wheel of birth and death. The gods recognize they expiation and bid thee drink of this cup of Immortality.\" Had Psyche reproached Eros for her unhappiness; had she refused to place the cause of her sin and suffering upon herself; had she given up the search for lost Love, the usual fate of mankind would have been hers. Unhappiness, poverty, worry, sickness, stagnation, death are the result of ceasing to search, to struggle, to conquer. The Soul forfeits Love and Immortality though disobedience. It achieves Love and Immortality though faith and trust and loyalty. \"Death is the problem of life, but Love is its solution.\" The search of the incarnate Soul for Immortality through the instrumentality of Love is typified in the search of Knights for the Golden Fleece, of the Holy Grail. The legend of Eros and Psyche may be interpreted as the Soul in search of love and immortality enduring anguish and suffering caused by the sins of fear, doubt, suspicion and disobedience. Other legends, as unfolded in this series, will outline and reveal those inner meanings, the significations of which are of importance to the students of knighthood and chivalry. ================================= (end quote here) This branch of the Illuminati, which originates in the Anglo ‐ Aryan race. In the myths, ladies and gentlemen, surrounding King Arthur and the Round Table and of those Knights of the Holy Grail who were the forerunners of the Order of the Garter and other knighthoods, and in particular of the group known as the Round Table. One particularly, is worth of interpretation, demonstrating as is does the use and abuse of power. And in the second hour tonight, we will tell you the story of Merlin. The story, ladies and gentlemen, of Merlin. And we continue of our revelation where the doctrine of Christian identity British Israelites, the master race, the people who want to rule everybody else. For in the all of the lodges, there is a prime, prime rule. The Anglo ‐ Aryan race is supreme, and you will find no one of color in the Lodge. Ladies and gentlemen, this scenario has been played throughout the history of man. It is never changed; there is always someone who believes that they are the master race. That they're the only ones fit to rule, and they intend to enslave everyone else ‐‐ even of their own race, for their motto is: If you are not one of us, you are nothing.

Well, we were supposed to have a metal report from Gene Miller, but he hasn't called, so we're going to get right into the program, and I'll guess he'll have to do it in this hour tomorrow night. Right off the bat I want to read a letter here from a listener named John, who sent the reply from the office of Arlen Specter, United States Senator for Pennsylvania: \"Dear Mr. John: Thank you for contacting my office regarding your request for Public Law 87 ‐ 297.

I called Washington and told them at 87 ‐ 297 can be found on page 652, volume 9 of title 22, United States Code, 1998 edition. I thank you for providing this information.

You see, since we ran the treason series, they have been telling you that the Public Laws are out of print and no longer available and that is a blatant lie. Not only are they in print and available to all Senators and Congressmen in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department, the President of the United States, the Library of Congress and every library in this country [sic]. So don't let these scumbag creep ‐ o treasonous traitors get away with it. Call them on it, just like John did, and make sure that you force their hand every single time; otherwise, they will ride right over you. In the earlier hour of the Hour of the Time, we began a new series on the Rose Cross College and I quoted, verbatim, from a book, entitled A Rose Cross College: , edited by R. Swinburne Clymer, copyrighted 1917, A Resume of the Teachings and Proceedings of the Rose Cross College During its Session Held in the Month of October, 1916, on the Four Hundredth Anniversary of the Founding of the Order. The Imperialistic Council and Venerable Order of the Magi, its instructions and the Official Degree 'Priests of Melchizadek.' The 'Knights of Chivalry and Order of the Holy Grail.' So folks, if you missed that hour, make sure that you order the tape. For non ‐ CAJI members, tapes are eight dollars postpaid; for CAJI members, they're six dollars postpaid. You may order tapes by sending your money to William Cooper, P.O. Box 1420, Show Low (spelled S ‐ H ‐ O ‐ W L ‐ O ‐ W), Arizona, 85901. That's P.O. Box 1420, Show Low, Arizona, 85901. In the beginning of this book, it described the initiation (laughs) in the Grove of Osiris and, uh, many other things, ladies and gentlemen, that you need to know. The ancient degrees of Osiris were conferred upon the delegates during that period of time in 1916. And, you know, I put out some hints for you people to be examining the Gritz SPIKE training tape, that there was symbolism there. Some of you did, most of you, as usual, stayed on your butts and didn't do anything. Many of you have been sucked in by Mr. Trojan Horse himself, Lt. Col. James [\"Bobo\"] Gritz. If you look real closely at his SPIKE training literature and his SPIKE training video, you will see that SPIKE is spelled S ‐ P ‐ (Obelisk) ‐ K ‐ E. S ‐ P ‐ (Obelisk) ‐ K ‐ E. Now, for those of you who don't know what that means: S ‐ P ‐ (Penis of Osiris) ‐ K ‐ E. He's playing you for a fool and again, just like all the others, he is laughing at you. A day ‐ and ‐ a ‐ half SPIKE training, (sarcasm:) uh ‐ huh. And he teaches you how to fight with a double ‐ edged blade and tells you that you are now a member of Delta Force. Let me read to you from a dictionary of Freemasonry exactly what \"delta\" means. And during a later program, ladies and gentlemen, we will play a tape, a briefing tape, for high ‐ ranking officers in the United States Army on the First Earth Battalion which describes, again, what task force Delta is really all about. \"Delta, the name of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. In form, it is a triangle, and was considered by the ancient Egyptians a symbol of fire and also of God. And the Scottish and French systems, and also that of the Knights Templar are delta is the unspeakable name.\" And we go back a little farther, ladies and gentlemen: \"INRI ‐‐ in effect, Jesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum , which means, \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,\" the inscription, which was placed upon the cross of the savior. In the philosophical lodge, they represent fire, salt, sulfur and mercury. In the system of the Rosicrucians, they have a similar use: IGNE NATURA RENOVATUR INTERGRA , meaning literally, \"By fire, nature is perfectly renewed.\" This idea is also found in the degree of Knights, Adepts of the Eagle or of the Sun. Remember, fire is connected to Delta; remember that they burn their enemies to purify the soul so that the enemies will not come back after them. Don't go away. You, you my dear sheeple, have an awful lot to learn. (opening music: The Rose , by Bette Midler) Governments are controlled and operated by a few, not with the thought of producing the most good for the greatest number of people, but to obtain power and riches for the few at the expense of the many. The few are wading in streams of gold while the many are growing under hard burdens. [reading from A Rose Cross College ]: (start quote here): ================================= In the myths surrounding King Arthur and the Round Table and of those Knights of the Holy Grail who are the forerunners of the Order of the Garter and other knighthoods, one particularly is worthy of interpretation, demonstrating as it does, the use and abuse of power. 305"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"The story of Merlin is soon told: \"Merlin was the son of no mortal father, but of an Incubus, one of a class of beings not absolutely wicked, but far from good, who inhabited regions of the air. Merlin's mother was a virtuous young woman, who, on the birth of her son, entrusted him to a priest, who hurried him to the baptismal fount, and so saved him from sharing the lot of his father, though he retained many marks of his unearthly origin. \"At this time Vortigern reigned in Britain. He was a usurper, who had caused the death of this sovereign, Monies, and driven the two brothers of the late king, whose names were Uther and Pendragon, into banishment. Vortigern, who lived in constant fear of the return of the rightful heirs of the kingdom, began to erect a strong tower for defense. The edifice, when brought by the workmen to a certain height, three times fell to the ground, without any apparent cause. The king consulted his astrologers on this wonderful event and learned from them that it would be necessary to bathe the corner ‐ stone of the foundation with the blood of a child born without a mortal father. \"In search for such an infant, Vortigern sent his messengers all over the kingdom, and they, by accident discovered Merlin, whose lineage seemed to point him out as the individual wanted. They took him to the king; but Merlin, young as he was, explained to the king the absurdity of attempting to rescue the fabric by such means, for he told him the true cause of the instability of the tower was its being placed over the den of two immense dragons whose combats shook the earth above them. The king ordered his workmen to dig beneath the tower, and when they had done so they discovered two enormous serpents, the one white as milk, the other red as fire. The multitude looked on with amazement, till the serpents, slowly risen from their den, and expanding their enormous folds, began the combat, when everyone fled in terror, except Merlin who stood by clapping his hands and cheering on the conflict. The red dragon was slain, and the white one, gliding through a cleft in the rock, disappeared. \"These animals typified, as Merlin afterwards explained, the invasion of Utherand Pendragon, the rightful princes, who soon after landed with a great army. Vortigren was defeated, and afterwards burned alive in the castle he had taken such pains to construct. On the death of Vortigren, Pendragon ascended the throne. Merlin became his chief adviser, and often assisted the king by his magical arts. \"Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts, Had built the King his havens, ships and halls.\" ‐‐ Vivian. \"Merlin continued to be a favorite counselor through the reigns of Pendragon, Uther, and Arthur, and at last disappeared from view, and was no more found among men, through the treachery of his mistress, Viviane, the Fairy, which happened in this wise. \"Merlin, having become enamored of the fair Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, was weak enough to impart to her various important secrets of his art, being impelled by fatal destiny, of which he was at the same time fully aware. The lady, however, was not content with his devotion, unbounded as it seem to have been, but 'cast about,' the Romance tell us, how she might 'detain him for evermore,' and one day addressed him in these terms: 'Sir, I would that we should make a fair place and a suitable, so contrived by art and by cunning that it might ever be undone, and that you and I should be there in joy and solace.' 'My lady,' said Merlin, 'I will do all this.' 'Sir,' and she, 'I would not have you do it, but you shall teach me, and I will do it, and then it will be more to my mind.' 'I grant you this,' said Merlin. Then he began to devise, and the damsel put it all in writing. And when he had devised the whole, then had the damsel full great joy, and showed him greater semblance of love then she had ever before made, and they sojourned together a long while. At length it fell out that, as they were going one day hand in hand through the forest of Breceliande, they found a bush of white ‐ thorn, which was laden with flowers; and they seated themselves under the shade of this white ‐ thorn, upon the green grass, and Merlin laid his head upon the damsel's lap, and fell asleep. Then the damsel rose, and made a ring with her wimple round the bush, and round Merlin, and began her enchantments, such as he himself had taught her; and nine times she made the ring, and nine times she made the enchantment, and then she went and sat down by him, and placed his head again upon her lap. \"And when he awoke and looked round him, it seemed to him that he was enclosed in the strongest tower in the world, and laid upon a fair bed. Then said he to the dame: 'My lady, you have deceived me, unless you abide with me, for no on hath power to unmake this tower but you alone.' She then promised she would be often there and in this she held her covenant with him. And Merlin never went out of that tower where his Mistress Viviane had enclosed him; but she entered and went out again when she listed. \"After this event Merlin was never more know to hold converse with any mortal but Viviane, except on one occasion. Arthur, having for some time missed him from his court, sent several of his knights in search of him, and, among the number, Sir Gawain, who met with a very unpleasant adventure while engaged in this quest. Happening to pass a damsel on his road, and neglecting to salute her, (as all true Knights should) she revenged herself for his incivility by transforming him into a hideous dwarf. He was bewailing aloud his evil fortune as he went through the forest of Breceliande, when suddenly he heard the voice of one groaning on his right hand; and looking that way, he could see nothing save a kind of smoke, which seemed like air, and through which he could not pass. Merlin then addressed him from out of the smoke, and told him by what misadventure he was imprisoned there. 'Ah sir,' he added, 'you will never see me more, and that 306"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"grieves me, but I cannot remedy it; I shall never more speak to you, nor to any other person, save only my mistress. But do thou hasten to King Arthur, and charge him for me to undertake, without delay, the quest of the Sacred Grail. The knight is already born, and has received knighthood at his hands, who is destined to accomplish the quest.' And after this he comforted Gawain under his transformation, assuring him that he should speedily be dischanted; and he predicted to him that he should find the King at Carduel, in Wales, on his return, and that all the other knights who had been on like quest would arrive there the same day as himself. And all this came to pass as Merlin had said.\" [William Cooper]: Now the interpretation of this story, ladies and gentlemen, goes something like this: ================================= (end quote here) And remember in the earlier hour, ladies and gentlemen, we learned that, to the Mysteries, the Holy Grail represents the soul. The soul. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and they don't even believe that most people have a soul until they prepare the body to receive it. (laughs) So, you are learning...you are learning much faster than you ever could on your own. Skipping ahead: \"In this respect, the Pyramid is a perfect symbol of man when he has reached the state called Illumination of Soul, or Soul Consciousness, or in other words, 'has found the Center, or located the All ‐ Seeing Eye.'\" Skipping ahead again: \"[Dr. Clymer asking:] 'May we look to Masonry in completing the great work, or will it continue to be purely materialistic? Let this be the mission of Masonry, to perfect the work for which its outer symbology stands. Shall it be so?'\" This is an admission that they are purely materialistic at this point and have been throughout their history. \"While this is truly a Masonic work, the work for which the Mason has made a good foundation when he has completed his three degrees, yet it is also a work for every man, and especially a work for those who have taken up, or who have opportunity and inclination to take up, the special training offered freely today by the representatives of the Ancient Schools, through the Illuminati, Sons of Osiris, Magi, and other Fraternities. Skipping ahead again, several pages...: \"The 'Fire Philosophy' is the basis of all Religious Mysteries and all the secret philosophies of the Universe. It is also the underlying principal on which All Secret Occult Brotherhoods are founded. It was taught in the Ancient Mysteries, and, although the knowledge of it has long been lost to the world, it has always been preserved in the Occult Fraternities. \"'The aim of all true initiation, no matter what the name of the Fraternity may be is to know the nature of the Secret Fire that regenerates the world and which renders him who comes into its possession immortal...' \"...The mystic has always held that Masonry was one of the basis upon which religion was founded, that the Mysteries of Masonry when fully understood, are the same as the Ancient Mysteries, and therefore the Mysteries of religion itself. \"...[section header:]THE WAY TO GODHOOD[?] Be thou a man and thou mayst be a god.\" Be a man and thou mayst be a god ‐‐ this is the divine command of the New Age.

James \"Bo\" Gritz is a 32nd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite, he is a member of the Mormon church and has been initiated in the temple ceremony in which it is revealed to him that Lucifer is the god he follows; that Christ had his chance on earth and failed, and that it is Lucifer's turn. This can be found and referenced and confirmed fully in a book entitled, The Godmakers , and in the video tape by the same name. Don't go away, folks. We'll be right back.

Early in the year 1916, instructions were received from the Count M. de St Vincent , Supreme Hierarch of the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis , to make preparations for a sacred Convocation on the 68th Anniversary of the establishment of the Supreme Grand Dome of the Fraternitas and Associate organizations as established in America by Dr. Paschal Beverly Randolph. \"At this Convocation, which was to convene on June first, 1916, the Neophyte body was to be informed of a crisis that would be the beginning of the enslavement of the people of America in a manner so insidious that they would not be aware of it. America was to become engaged in a war that would only be the beginning of greater wars. \"It was prophesied that an effort would be made to destroy the Christian religion, so secretly and silently, that only the alert and elect would be aware of this activity. \"This effort is in full bloom today and is making atheists out of millions, even before their churches are destroyed; the reverse of what has happened, and [what] is happening, in other countries. \"At this Convocation we were instructed to hold daily lectures on subjects vitally important to all...in fact, to all the world, and more especially so to Neophytes of the August Fraternity. These instructions were to be after the manner of Plato and the Round Table of King Arthur. \"In addition, we were to prepare for the exemplification of the entire ritual of the Fraternity, Sons of Osiris, up to, and including, the Royal Purple Degree ‐‐ the ultimate of Ancient Ritualistic Initiation, symbolizing the Neophyte's travels and efforts, beginning with the first step, and including the final step, which is the second, or spiritual birth.\" [William Cooper]: So, ladies and gentlemen, you are now beginning to learn some things that you thought was absolutely impossible, and I told you on many episodes of the Hour of the Time that none of this is hidden; anyone can find it. Anyone , that is, except sheeple, who are too lazy to get up and look. Those who will, may. [William Cooper]: I am a messenger. Do not doubt that, ever. And the message that I am bringing to you is clear. It is concise, and there can be no mistake in its interpretation. You must wake up now or be enslaved. The war has begun many years ago. The war was declared by our enemies upon us. We are absolutely within our rights to restore our nation using any method or any manner that is required in so doing. You had better listen. [continuing reading from The Teachings of the Masters, the Wisdom of the Ages ]: \"Some years ago, R. Swinburne Clymer, following his graduation as a physician, and author of many books; among them The Mysticism of Masonry , The Rosicrucians, Their Teachings ; The Mysteries of Osiris , a book for members only; The Philosophy of Fire ; Soul Science and Immortality , and over thirty other works, bought a mountainous tract of land, and on this was built 'Beverly Hall,' an Assembly Hall; 308"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"press [rooms]; chemical laboratories which [were] surrounded by orchards, vineyards...rose gardens...set amongst terraced lawns, presents a splendid combination of the beautiful and practical.\" [William Cooper]: And upon the front lawns are perfect duplicates of the three pyramids of Giza. \"[And to] this was added the Mystic, or Arcane [ , for, folks,] in a secluded wooded tract of fifty acres of this land, an artificial lake was built from a mountain stream, a Throne Room erected for the explication of the Royal Third Degree of Osiris and the [secret] Seal of Solomon built under the protection of a mighty oak.\" [William Cooper]: The Temple of the Sun, an exact duplicate of that of the outer courtyard of the Vatican, and exact duplicate of the separate four sections of that which can be found in Dealey Plaza. The obelisk, the phallus of Osiris, which can be found in New York, in London, in the Vatican and in Dealey Plaza. The Grove of Osiris, represented in Dealey Plaza by Elm Street. Wake up. \"During the period of the Convocation, the teachers and delegates delivered many lectures on the subjects of Eugenics, Scientific Motherhood, Code of Ethics, Spiritual Christianity [William Cooper: That's a laugh when you discover what it is.], Initiation, Reincarnation, Soul Development, the Four ‐ Square man, Mystic Significance of the Seal of the United States, and other important subjects; all interpreted in their Arcane significance by the Masters of the See [spelled S ‐ E ‐ E]. \"Moses was well versed in all the Mysteries of Egypt, while Joseph took the Nazarene to Egypt where he was educated. [William Cooper]: The Nazarene, ladies and gentlemen, was Jesus Christ. This is what they claim. \"[They claim that] no ceremony of the Greater Mysteries was ever permitted unless the circle or Seal of Solomon, also known as the Sacred Seal of Equilibrium , had been previously prepared. Since the fall of Egypt and the Temple of Solomon, the seal has received little or no attention, except by a limited few students and Neophytes of Ancient religion and the Mysteries . \"During the first week in June, in the grove so carefully prepared for the dramatization of the Ancient Initiation into the Mysteries of Osiris, the ritual in its entirety was re ‐ enacted by those present. \"The Seal of Solomon which had been especially built for the purpose, was dedicated on June the 11th, 1916, in the presence of the members and delegates of the Rosy Cross; some of whom were natives of Germany, England and (white) Russia. This was in accordance with, and after the manner of, the system [as] practiced by the ancient Initiate Priests of Egypt, and the Altar in the Temple of Solomon. \"On the night of June [13 th ], the first section of the delegation, including those of the Order taking part in the Initiation, assembled in the grove of Osiris [under the majestic Oak, the whole illuminated by a central power house prepared for the Initiation ceremonies of the Ancient Mysteries of Egypt in three degrees and six scenes.\" [William Cooper]: Three degrees and six scenes, represented by the number 18, or 666. It is the number of a man, that man is the illumined man who has passed the travails of the three degrees in six acts. It is the man, it is the Anti ‐ Christ, it is the rulers of the New World Order. I'm going to skip ahead, ladies and gentlemen, for we must go to that portion that is relevant to what you need to learn tonight. And we will continue; if we do not finish tonight, and I guarantee we will not, we will finish sometime in the future. We will continue on consecutive nights until we do. \"Few Americans at the present day have the slightest idea of how fortunate they are and that they are living in the greatest, freest nation that ever existed, despite its many shortcomings. [William Cooper: Now, remember, I'm reading this from the book, Teachings of the Masters .] Neither are they aware that America, \"the land overshadowed with wings,\" is at the crossroads, one leading to...freedom, both individual and universal, and the other to the most abject and degrading serfdom, as a result of failing to accept the full responsibility for the management of their personal and Governmental affairs so that these may harmonize with the ancient prophecies.\" [William Cooper]: Remember, I warned you and I told you that is exactly what is happening. This was the Great Experiment. If you had been proven worthy, this could have been the New World Order, sheeple. \"A still lesser number are aware that the history of America, from its very beginning to the end of its days, whether from good or ill, is told in its Seal [William Cooper: exactly as I have told you on past programs]; while only the very few know that their own destiny is irrevocably interwoven with the destiny of AMERICA; America , the last trying chamber for human Souls, and that when this trial is over, either heaven or hell will reign supreme. Few care because they selfishly think only of themselves; they forget the future welfare of their sons and daughters.\" 309"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And, of course, we saw that when you all padded your sons and daughters on the butt and sent them off to die in a war in a desert in the Middle East, all the while claiming that they were going off to fight for their country, you fools! \"Desert Scam.\" \"An old saying has it that 'familiarity breeds contempt.' As a corollary to this, there should be another maxim: 'We are blind to that which we see so frequently.' Most Americans, even though the spirit of America dwells within them, are actually only dimly aware that the great Seal of the first actually free country in the world shows an eagle, a constellation of stars, an olive branch and a set of thirteen arrows. This is the seal we all know. Symbolically, the eagle 'overshadows' the land by its protective wings, BUT ONLY AS LONG AS MAN PROVES WORTHY OF SUCH OVERSHADOWING or protection . Man has the power to destroy the 'Eagle' that overshadows or protects him. \"The constellation of stars indicates that the founders of America accepted the absolute law that is governed the ' Drama of Heaven ' since the beginning of the world and must be accepted and obeyed in this new world. The olive branch is the symbol of peace and friendship held out to all who are willing to forget and completely root out from their consciousness, the degeneration of old worlds and elect to live in the spirit of the New World [or the New Age]. \"The thirteen arrows are symbolic of the wars which are part of THE DRAMA IN THE HEAVENS AND THE WARS THAT MUST BE WAGED AGAINST ALL EVILS, AS WELL AS ALL EVIL INDIVIDUALS; THAT MAN'S FREEDOM IS TO BE MAINTAINED. IT IS EACH AND EVERY CITIZEN'S PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ETERNALLY FIGHT AGAINST THESE INDIVIDUAL AND UNIVERSAL EVILS. \"There is the prophetic reverse side of the seal; uncut, because the time is not ready for the prophetic fulfillment, which was known to few others than the Philosophic Initiates , prior to its profane and premature use on the American one ‐ dollar certificate. \"Several attempts have been made to cut this reverse side of [this] seal, but in each instance, an invisible hand or force , restrained the effort. At the time of the Chicago World's Fair, this reverse side was ordered cut together with the familiar reverse side as an object of display, but those in charge, WHOLLY IGNORANT OF ITS MEANING, AND (also ignorant) OF THE SPIRIT OF TRUE AMERICA, questioned: 'What a peculiar design! Why are we given this inartistic design?' And this WHITE STONE, symbolic of the nation's destiny, as of the nation's true Souls, was once again rejected. \"THE SOUL OF AMERICA is betrayed and is in travail . Foreign inimical hordes in almost unrestrained access into the country without a thought as to whether or not they are ready to throw off the gross, degrading, destructive evils of the old world and INVEST THEMSELVES WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW WITH A WHOLEHEARTED WILLINGNESS TO OBEY AMERICA'S FUNDAMENTAL LAWS. \"Nor is that all! [They're] given high places; usurping the rights and privileges of those MORE CAPABLE, BORN AMERICANS WHOLLY IMBUED WITH THE TRUE AMERICAN SPIRIT.\" [William Cooper]: If you have ears and you can hear and eyes and you can see, you will begin to understand what the author is saying within a few more paragraphs. And you will be shocked. \"This helps bring about the gradual degradation of all that is TRULY AMERICAN; so much so that the 'eagle whose wings overshadow America,' is GRADUALLY FOLDING HER WINGS AND WITHDRAWING Heaven's protection. The time is come when a full knowledge of the two ‐ fold seal and all it stands for shall be known to the people, so they MAY ACCEPT AND BE PROTECTED ([or] saved); OR IGNORED AND BE DAMNED ([and be] swept into the sea of oblivion) ‐‐ as have been other nations before America ‐‐ because they permitted foreign invasion and the adoption of destructive ideas to take the place of the constructive ideas which had made them great. \"America must awaken! She must be awakened by one means or another. Her own safety and the welfare of our own people must be protected against all foreign spawned ideologies born as the result of selfishness and defiance of God Himself and all his Laws; Laws which, throughout the eons, have preserved the world and the Drama of Heaven, through the peoples of nations unnumbered have perished as a result of their own disobedience and degradation. \"America, its people individually and collectively, must become valiant and now henceforth stand before the world as EXEMPLARS. They must be leaders and promulgators of a new and equitable system of ethics, religious inculcations based on sound material and spiritual truths, and a citizenship that is honorable and noble; a justice and generosity to other nations that is unquestioned (but WITHOUT THE WEAKNESS OF COWARDLY COMPROMISE lacking all honor and fairness to her own people ), and emphasize the possibility of brotherhood based on individuality, personal freedom and obedience to laws that apply universally. \"[Now,] to digress, but vital to our thesis: Late in the afternoon of July 14th, 1776, the New Continental Congress 'Resolved, that Dr. Franklin, Mr. J. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, be a committee to prepare a device for a Seal of the United States of America [ ‐‐ all of these men, members of the Mystery Religion].' 310"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"\"The committee was identical with the one that had drawn up the Declaration of Independence, except for the omission of Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Declaration itself had been signed at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and Congress desired to at once complete the evidence of the independence of the United States and [of] its people , by formally adopting an official sign of sovereignty and National Coat of Arms. \"The coat of arms of England, the mother country, illustrated the union of Judas' lion, with the unicorn of 'Lost Israel' in accordance with the science governing Heraldry. The young republic, born out of the throes of religious persecution more than as a result of the sufferings of unjust taxation , was through, finished, with thrones and crowns. It was ready to blaze a new path, UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE EAGLE'S WINGS, through the forest of the new world in the cause of liberty, which should express her dissent from the SPIRIT OF THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLES OF ALL NATIONS and open a door for all who sought help and shelter upon her shores. \" [William Cooper]: She rejected , she rejected British Israelism, she rejected the Lion of Judah. \"In the early colonel days, a knowledge of Heraldry was considered an important part of education, just as throughout the ages, it was necessary to have an understanding of symbolism which indicated a knowledge of the governing Law of the Universe and the DRAMA OF THE AGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON HUMANITY, individually and collectively. It was through William Barton, son of the rector of St. James Episcopal Church of Philadelphia, learned in Heraldry and Baron Prestwich, of England, that the designs expressive of America's destiny were developed and drawn.\" [William Cooper]: First, you must understand that the lion represents the tribe of Judah. Judah was not a part of the state of Israel. That is a historical fact, ladies and gentlemen. Israel was separate from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. Our forefathers knew this. The British, apparently, do not and neither, apparently, do identity Christians. \"The two sides of America's seal express in Heraldry the countless ages of the evolution of man. This evolution had its beginning even before the time of the so ‐ called or misinterpreted 'fall' of man. The seal symbolizes man's progress in Egypt ( eagleland ‐‐ America's actual fatherland) where, for a time, a wondrous race incarnated to build an unexplainable and inconceivable monument as a symbol of, and memorial to, the knowledge imparted to her by the more ancient Atlantis.\" [William Cooper]: And this is confirmation of everything that I have been telling you about the beliefs of the Mystery Religion. \"The ancient memorial or altar, the Great Pyramid, unites in a blaze of glory with the later building of King Solomon's temple, as a prophecy of the coming of a master ‐ teacher, the Nazarene . He should be trained, taught and Initiated in the 'eagleland' and bring into manifestation the human ‐ spiritual temple, PERFECTING THE SON OF MAN INTO THE SON OF GOD, as a fulfillment of ancient prophecy; that in this same Egypt, there should remain an altar where Light should shine in the land of darkness. Another prophecy by Isaiah , in symbolism, connected the land of Egypt ([or] eagleland) with the land 'overshadowed by the wings of the Eagle' (America), where there is an altar (statue of Liberty) upon which is burning the light of freedom for all who accept the law and are worthy of their freedom. This great Pyramid, an altar at the center of the earth (symbolic of man's spiritual or Soul center), recognized as a temple of the highest initiation, was emblematic of the perfect man; four ‐ square, of body, mind, spirit and Soul. [William Cooper]: Where have you heard: \"As I raise my hand to the square,\" or \"As I raise my arm to the square?\" \"Its white copestone symbolizes the attainment of Immortality or Cosmic Consciousness [William Cooper: and you hear that throughout the New Age movement]. It represents the measure of the earth as well as that of the Universe, as also the evolution of physical man through those countless ages of reincarnation, now drawing to a restricted time. [William Cooper]: A time in which man will revert in his evolutionary path, or will become gods. \"'The last Cumaen Song now comes,' wrote Virgil , and prophesied that a race should arise which would be the offspring of all races, except those who isolated themselves, and bring about the end of the ages of iron ([or] war); ushering in the Golden Age; an age of honor, personal responsibility , and obedience to the Divine Law . \"It was therefore fitting that the mottoes upon the reverse side of our seal, above and below the pyramid, should be taken from Virgil, ANNUIS CŒPTIS – [means] 'Prosper us in our daring, ' and NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM – [means] 'A New World Order.' [*note: book says, 'a new and select order'] It is well to constantly keep in mind the term SELECT, because it is only the obedient, hence the 'select' that may, or can, reap the benefit of the REacting Law.\" What unadulterated bullshit.

I'm William Cooper. [Carolyn Nelson]: And I'm Carolyn Nelson. [William Cooper]: And right off the back, folks, we've spoken to our supplier and we are back in the food storage business, and this time I hope you can take advantage of it. Only, unfortunately, you don't hurry, you're going to pay a lot more, and that's the truth... [WC does commercial for food storage] Tonight, we're going to get further into the exposé of the root of racial tension in this country and elsewhere in the world; how they keep us divided and conquered and what it really stems from. And most of you who believe in this Aryan master race crap and most of you who call yourselves identity Christians: I don't care if you worship in that church, I don't care if you believe that. The only people I care about are people who are racist who want to kill other people who don't look like them, or hurt other people who don't look like them, or get rid of them or something. Those people I will oppose forever. I will protect your right to worship at whatever altar you wish to worship at, as long as you want to worship there forever...I don't care. That's your, your business, and your right in this country. We believe in that right; that's the only way that it can be. Otherwise, you're going to have a state that has a state church, and we're all going to have to confirm to that, and that's exactly what the New World Order is going to be. But you're all going to find out that you're the victims , victims of people who have a hidden agenda. And most of your preachers and ministers who are teaching you this crap and feeding it to you are members of these secret societies and they are promoting Zionism . Zionism. For behind Zionism is not Jewish, folks, it's not the Jewish people. They're being used. They're going to be sorry for allowing themselves to be used. For behind the Zionist movement are the British Israelis, the people who believe they are the master race, that they are the lost 13th tribe of Israel, that they are the people who are going to inherit the world and the rest of us are going to be their slaves. And if you don't believe that, you just listen. Don't go away. I'll be right back. (opening music: The Rose , by Bette Midler) Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll check your history you'll find in the accounts left by the Romans, as they sent their legions up into Europe to conquer the Celts, the Picts, the Galls, and the Germanic tribes, they describe very clearly what they found there. And what they found, ladies and gentlemen, was nothing that even remotely could ever be misinterpreted as any remnant of any of the tribes of Israel. It is clear what they found were primitive tribesmen. Some of them were gentle and not war ‐ like, and were easily conquered by the Romans. They had no root of Hebrew in their language, period, none of them, anywhere. Most of them, however, were fierce tribesmen, many of whom went into battle naked, covered with mud, screaming like banshees and had no mercy for anything. Their women would come along behind them and pick whatever was worth anything off of the bodies of the dead. And there are accounts that they would even eat parts of the bodies of their slain enemies. The Germanic tribes were so fierce and so primitive and so pagan that the Roman legions were constantly in battle at that frontier, and never did completely conquer the Germanic tribes. The Celts, what were known as the Galls, what were known as the Picts, most of them were conquered by the Romans. Some of them were incorporated into the Roman Empire, and paid taxes to the Romans. All of this is on record. Of course, the Romans brought their religion into those regions and, coupled with pagan religions of those peoples, new legends and new myths, new metaphors began to 313"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"evolve. And eventually, as the Roman Empire became the Catholic Church, and the Roman emperor became the pope, the Catholic religion was introduced and mixed with many of these legends and fables and metaphors. And in many of these places, strange tales and legends grew up. As they struggled to interpret the new religion from the new bible, they began to create legends, stories that never happened, and were never recorded before that time in their history, nor in the history of the Romans in their interaction with them. Now, these legends did not become prominent. Nobody paid any attention to them and you will find any record of them until the Normans gained power in England. When the Normans gained power in England, the secret societies began to front for the Norman cause. And a whole legend was created, and scriptures were found to back it up, that the Anglo ‐ Aryan race was the lost 13th tribe of Israel. None of it stands up under any scrutiny, either historically or scripturally. But, I hear on the radio, and I see and read in pamphlets and books, all of the bent and warped scriptures and references, and the out and out lies of the history, tried to back this up. Because this will carry you into the New World Order, and whether you realize it or not, any of you who cling to this or promote it are promoting the New World Order. You are helping to destroy the United States of America, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and freedom for all of us. And you had better get your head on straight and quit listening to those who are misleading you. It is a heady wine to think that you are somehow better than others; that you are a master race destined to rule the world, and when Christ comes, you will be the chosen people, and everyone else will bow to you. It is a lie, ladies and gentlemen, and when you front those ideas and when you espouse those beliefs, you are, in effect, you are a Christian calling Jesus Christ a liar. And I suggest you go back and read his words, for he never made any distinction between classes of people, he never rejected anyone nor did he run after anyone who passed his teaching on the road and passing his teaching down their throat. It never happened...never, not once. He accepted anyone who came to him no matter their race, their color or their creed. No matter their station in life, whether they were a prostitute or a noblemen, it made no difference to Jesus Christ. And his...his formula for acceptance into the kingdom of heaven was simply this: \"Whomsoever beliveth in me shall have everlasting life.\" He did not say, \"Whomsoever is a British Israelite shall have everlasting life.\" He did not say, \"Whomsoever is black shall have everlasting life.\" He did not say, \"\"Whomsoever is a Jew shall have everlasting life.\" He did not say, \"\"Whomsoever is an Anglo ‐ Aryan shall have everlasting life.\" And you had better understand that those who are manipulating you and teaching you these lies are heading you for a fall. There is no master race, there never was and never will be. Of course, if you're not a Christian, then this doesn't make much difference to you. But it is a manipulation; it comes out of the heart of the Mysteries that came from ancient Babylon and were twisted on the continent and in England to promote a hidden agenda. And I quote, ladies and gentlemen, from the book, entitled The Teachings of the Masters , written by Reverend R. Swinburne Clymer, who was the Director General of the Church of Illumination, the Supreme Grand Master of the International Confederation of Initiates, of the O.T.O., of the Golden Dawn, of Freemasonry, of the Knights of Malta and the Knights Templar, the Supreme Grand Master of the merged occult fraternities comprising the Priesthood of Eyeth(sp?), the Rosicrucian Order, the Secret Schools, the Hermetic Brotherhood, Fraternitas Rosae Crucis , Temple of the Rose and Cross, the Order of the Magi, Sons of Isis and Osiris, Illuminatae Americanae , which translated means, \"The American Illuminati.\" And this book was published by the Philosophical Publishing Company of Beverly Hall, Quakertown, Pennsylvania in 1952. The source of this information is from The 68th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order , to which all of the high ‐ ranking members of nefarious orders and fraternities of what is known by the brotherhood as the \"Illuminatae\", or \"Brotherhood of Man\", internationally as \"The Internationale,\" in 1916 at Beverly Hall. And I quote verbatim and you had better listen, because this is the source of your teachings and it will be the hardcore of the New World religion; it is already pervasive in the New Age movement, and it is very easily checked. I quote: [reading from The 68th Convocation of the Rose Cross Order ]: \"[The source of the mystical teachings of the New Testament can offer no other interpretation of the] symbolism [of] the young republic, than that of the ancient Pyramid, it's cope stone and glory, significant of the descent of the New Jerusalem, for the one side, and the eagle, and the ever repeating thirteen of Manasseh, thirteenth [or lost, torn away] tribe of Israel and the son of Joseph (the Britons) who was separated from his brethren in Egypt, in the parting asunder of northern Israel from southern Judah...\" [William Cooper]: Now, historically, Judah was never a part of Israel and that's why they say here, \"northern Israel from souther Judah,\" because Judah was never a part of Israel. And they made it sounds as if Judah, a part of Israel, separated itself from the whole, then they can be found historically correct so they tell the truth. \"...the parting asunder of northern Israel from southern Judah [never again to be part of Judah], and [the] first to cross Europe in search of the [legendary] \"isles afar off,\" to re ‐ establish the ancient [Gentile] throne of Israel at Tava in Ireland.\" [William Cooper]: Now, it is significant that they separate the name Israel into three syllables: IS ‐ RA ‐ EL, with dashes. It stands for \"Isis,\" \"RA,\" who is represented as Osiris, and \"EL,\" \"EL\" means \"God.\" 314"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"\"...the hitherto rejected reverse side of our [great] seal [is now in full view] of these United States, [it is to] remind [the people that, from the beginning,] they were called to a Great Work as offspring of...a might Manasseh, whose history began in Genesis and [will culminate] in America, and by whose stripes the...world must be healed [and will healed, despite the many and inglorious betrayals of those who set themselves up as the leaders of the peculiar people of the eagle. The legend tells us that] Joseph [betrayed, as we have often been, and cast off by his own people,] married [the] daughter of [the] priest of the Temple of On, in Egypt.\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, if you listened to this program, you know that On is another name for the Sun, or Osiris, or the Light, or Lucifer. They're saying that Joseph, as the legend tells, and it is a legend; it is not historical fact ‐‐ never was and never can be, for it is a lie. \"[The legend tells us that] Joseph [betrayed, as we have often been, and cast off by his own people,] married [the] daughter of [the] priest of the Temple of On, in Egypt. Today [as an eternal symbol until the time of the placing of the cope stone upon the pyramid] one pillar of that ancient Temple stands in London, while its mate stands in New York.\" [William Cooper]: It is the phallus of Osiris, the obelisk. There is also in the outer courtyard of the Vatican and one stands in Dealey Plaza. One also stands on the estate grounds of the Prieuré de Sion , of the House of Sion in England. \"These are [vivid and should be] constant reminders [to us of our unbreakable connections] with [ancient] Egypt, and with...Europe, and our father Joseph as an Anglo Saxon culmination as a result of this union [and] between [these two] pillars must all the world [in biblical language] pass into Ephraim, or Shiloh.\" [William Cooper]: Professor Totten, an imminent symbologist understood these ancient Mysteries fully and indicated this in his statement: \"The whole Bible is written in the stars, both the law and the gospel, while esoterically the entire story of man is set forth upon the sea of Manasseh. The obverse side is Israel [under the old covenant]...as the hope and [victory] of Christianity. The two sides reflect each other and cannot be separated,\" and that is the meaning of the New Covenant that Clinton espouses, for he also is a member. [William Cooper]: This was...this played dramatically in the photography published worldwide, where he stood in the Oval Office holding up a single red rose. Castro has been photographed holding up the same single red rose, as has been Gorbachev, the leader of France, and the Queen of England. [William Cooper]: There is a possibility of England's betrayal and by forces within which meant America would be compelled to stand alone. This possibility or probability was indicated in the poem ascribed to Merlin to King Arthur's court of our constellation of thirteen stars. And we'll get into that right after this break, ladies and gentlemen. You see, this country has been betrayed by the Tories, who never wanted to separate from England in the first place. The body of the Illuminati around the world are working toward one ‐ world government and if this Anglo ‐ Saxon faction has its way, they will rule the world through a council of elders. If the Vatican has its way, the Pope will sit on the throne of the world. (break music: From a Distance , written by Julie Gold, performed by Nanci Griffith?) Backing up one paragraph, I quote again: \"[There is a possibility of England's betrayal and by forces within, in which event America would be compelled to stand alone. This is possibility (aye, probability) was clearly indicated in the poem ascribed to] Merlin of King Arthur's court [on the] constellation of the thirteen stars...\" [William Cooper]: Here, they attribute truth to legend. Supposedly, Merlin said: \"When the cock (France) shall woo the Dove (America) Mother and child shall cease to love (Rebellion of colonies) When the cock (France) shall guard the eagle's nest (France's aid) The stars (our constellation of 13) shall rise all in the west Then seven and six shall make but one (E Pluribus Unum) The Lion's might shall be undone.\" [William Cooper]: Here they attribute to a mythical figure, Merlin, a prophecy which, they say, is being fulfilled in the world. \"When the cock [or France] shall woo the Dove [which they say is America]; Mother and child shall cease to love [in other words, rebellion of her 315"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"colonies against England]; When the cock shall guard [in other words, France's aid] to the eagle's nest [which is the United States, or America]; The stars [which, they say, are our constellation of 13] shall rise all in the west; Then seven and six shall make but one [E Pluribus Unum, as their interpretation]; [and] The Lion's might shall be undone.\" [William Cooper]: This prophecy has been rapidly coming to pass since the Second World War, the English, the Anglo ‐ Saxons, have permitted enemies within her borders, many of her own race, to gain control of her finances and institutions and replace what might be correctly termed, \"Druidic Christianity,\" and that's exactly what it is: it's a perversion of true Christianity. In fact, when you hear what it really consists of, you will discover, ladies and gentlemen, it is not Christianity at all, but the remnant of the old pagan, druidic and Germanic gall picked religion, mixed with a little mixture of Christianity. Using this lie, this legend of Joseph, to [make?] them into a master race. These are the same people who, just prior to World War II, attempted , attempted to turn England into an ally with Hitler. You see, druidic Christianity is a godless atheism really. They say, unless the English wake up, the Lion's might will certainly be undone, and the old saying, \"There always will be an England,\" will be proven unfounded. [continuing reading]: \"The stars upon our seal are set in the form of a six pointed star of [the] double triangle [symbolic of the perfectly balanced man. After the downfall of Egypt, this was called] Solomon's Seal...\" [William Cooper]: And that is a lie. It was never called Solomon's Seal until it was adopted by the Jewish people as their symbol sometime in the 16th century, ladies and gentlemen. They say [that?] the ages before that it had its place in the temples of the greater Mysteries, and that is true. That's exactly where it comes from. Indicating that the physical man and the spiritual man had attained equilibrium, and that the Son of Man had indeed become the Son of God. Now, bear in mind that that is not a reference to Jesus Christ. \"At each point of the star was placed the symbol of an Order which [symbolized] Arcane wisdom [and because of the presence of the altar within], no man might pass into the Holy of Holies [or innermost chamber]...with safety to himself [save he who attained to philosophic initiation].\" [William Cooper]: And that is the true definition of Solomon's Temple within the Masonic lodges and the lodges of all of these other liars and deceivers. For the Temple of Solomon that they discuss has nothing to do with the Christian religion or the Jewish religion, but lies within each of them according to their own definitions. I continue: \"[The special or spiritual] symbol of America, aside from the pyramid or eagle, is the white rose, identical in [its] meaning [to] the white stone [of legend and primitive Masonry, for the meaning and the history of the white rose.\" [sic] [William Cooper]: Study the War of the Roses and you will find your eyes opened as to who is really behind this and what it really means. I continue: \"The constellation of thirteen stars was in early drawings set in a wreath of white roses, showing that the early designers knew [fully aware] the future of American individual spiritual development.\" [William Cooper]: And that is a lie. Our forefathers were not a part of this. They are the ones who broke away from England, ladies and gentlemen. This is a perversion of their beliefs. They certainly were members of the secret societies and the Illuminati, and they were working toward the Great Work of one ‐ world government. But not under Anglo ‐ Aryan rule. You see, our forefathers truly believed, in their day, of the Brotherhood of Man, meaning all man at some point in the future standing upon an equal keel at birth, and making for themselves what they will through individual responsibility. They really wanted this nation to succeed but they knew in their hearts, because they knew human nature very well, that we would abdicate our responsibilities and our freedoms and would become slaves. And they would have to institute some kind of government to control the mob. Their aim was to topple the churches and states that existed in their world and bring about a true freedom of mankind, hoping that this would be it. Giving us all the tools to make the experiment succeed or fail, for man should ‐‐ they believed, and I believe also ‐‐ get what he deserves. \"[The design] is now drawn set in white clouds [showing that the true nature of America is clouded, or under a cloud at the moment. These clouds are shadows symbolizing the confusion of the present era, will gradually be replaced by bright sunshine, symbol of light, enlightenment, sheer perception and understanding]. \"Solomon's Temple was the [design] of [the] perfect man [perfection is the ultimate of every man, unless he chooses an ignoble defeat]...the Bible [like the Arcane teachings of the greater Mysteries] tells us of [the] three cornered cope stone which was [prepared to finish the pyramid of the Temple, but was] rejected, [and] later became the headstone of the corner....Genesis [tells us] of [one] Joseph, the keeper of the 'stone of Israel'...\" 316"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: And I might remind you, Isis was also called, 'the Stone.' \"It was because of the Magian or Holy Grail teachings that the Britons crossed Europe to Arsareth, Land of Betrothal...\" [William Cooper]: They quote Esdras 11 ‐ 13. Folks, can you find the book of Esdras in the Bible? Of course not. They will quote anything that furthers their perversion and their lie. \"[They say they] crossed Europe to Arsareth, Land of Betrothal...in search of a land where they might keep God's worship pure and undefiled. Hence through Joseph, who was separated [cast out or sold by] his brethren, we inherit[ed] the white stone of all Israel, [the] cope stone of the pyramid, and of Solomon's Temple, that rock upon which [the initiate Nazarene] reminded Pater, he should build [God's] church...\" [William Cooper]: (laughs) Oh my, oh my. \"...the rock [or foundation] of spiritual unfoldment within each individual, [and against which, in the ultimate,] the gates of hell...should not prevail. [What this true church really is is made plain in:] My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.\" [William Cooper]: Now they call Christ the Christos . \"Be formed\" means, \"awakened,\" in their language and they reference Galatians, chapter 4, verse 19. The one single word offers us the key to the entire mystery of the church and of man's ultimate goal. To \"travail\" is to suffer in giving birth. This birth is in or within us. Is is the: \"Unless ye are born of the spirit as ye had been of your mother's womb,\" you shall in no wise be able to enter the kingdom of Heaven, a biblical and mystical lore. \"[This being the law which governs the universe as it governs the drama of heaven, which is the old cosmology worshiped at places like Stonehenge,] it was in keeping that an Englishman, a Master of Heraldry, should give to the young republic [during] its struggles to separate from the mother country [as does the child from its mortal mother], the design for [not only the work of the true Christic , or Christos church ‐‐ I refer you to the Christic Institute, which just is another branch of these perversions ‐‐ also] the design for the Great Seal, which would express the whole future of [the new country's] work as a world teacher and exponent of the...teachings [of the new church and] of the Holy Grail. \"The All Seeing Eye, [looking] down upon the ancient pyramid...symbolizes America [the eaglet of 'Eagle Land'] and all she must mean to the world. [If she does not permit herself to be betrayed by the degrading and destructive ideologies of decadent European and Asiatic countries, an utterly selfish traitorous leadership in our own country.] This emblem, the eye is as [ancient] as man's appearance upon [the] earth, being found upon [the Egyptian, Greek and Chaldean monuments]...\" [William Cooper]: And I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen, they knew that it meant America back in those days. (sarcasm): Mm ‐ hmm, yeah, you just keep thinking that, fools. This is beyond understanding how intelligent people can fall for these scams and be so manipulated by someone who comes along, flashes some kind of certificate that we went to some kind of a school that taught him how to understand the Bible, and he preaches this perversion, and people fall right into line and believe it as fact, simply because this person told them to. If you follow them around long enough, you will follow them to the doors of the lodge of one of these secret societies, I can assure you. \"This emblem, the eye is as [ancient] as man's appearance upon [the] earth, being found upon [the Egyptian, Greek and Chaldean monuments], while the Arabians [looked] upon it and named the Highest and Holiest name of God [and] with hushed voices...whispered, 'I am that I am.'\" [William Cooper]: And that is what Elizabeth Claire Prophet preaches in Montana. \"The triangle about the eye, stood from the most [ancient days] as the emblem of the Trinity...\" [William Cooper]: Now, get this, folks, because this is what their Trinity really refers to! \"The triangle about the eye, stood from the most [ancient days] as the emblem of the Trinity...Osiris, Isis and Horus [progenitors of humanity], Father, [Mother ‐ the Mother they call the] Holy Ghost and [the] Son...[it is the seal of the eternal law of the] three of the universe and [the watchful guide to those who awaken and walk in the light. 'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way, which thou shall go.]. 'I will guide thee with mine eye.' ‐‐ Psalms 32:8. \"[The legend symbolized by the Pyramid] is esoteric, [given] in numbers, measures, and weights, and [these] may be read the [history of] ages [already] completed, and the prophecy of those yet to come.\" 317"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"[William Cooper]: I refer you to Ice: The Ultimate Disaster, 5/5/2000 ; that's the name of the book: 5/5/2000 ‐ Ice : The Ultimate Disaster, by Richard Noone. I refer you in that book, specifically to the interview with Tom Valentine, where he parrots this exactly same philosophy! I also refer you to his book about the pyramids, I forget the name of it, and his other book, The Late, Great ...I'm sorry, The Life and Death of Planet Earth . I was thinking of a book written by Hal Lindsey. But Valentine's book is The Life and Death of Planet Earth . You'll find this same philosophy espoused throughout, and you find him on Radio Freemasonry, running you around in circles chasing your tails, even now. \"[Throughout the past ages each with its leader runs the legend of] the 'Stone Kingdom cut out without hands'...\" [William Cooper]: Now, remember, throughout all past ages, this legend, this story, this perversion has been repeated throughout the pagan religion and since the beginning of time when man first looked up and equated the sun with the power of God. The inner kingdom of heaven, the last and greatest of all was the Master [Nazarene, had he not been betrayed by his own people as in England, the land of Joseph, and the Grail being betrayed today. Notice, when it comes to the Nazarene who was of Israel being betrayed, all of a sudden he's been betrayed by his own people, but his own people are no longer these people, you see. That's blamed on the Jews, but yet they claim to be of the tribe of Israel. What hypocrites, what liars, what deceivers, what perverters, what manipulators. [William Cooper]: Unless Americans in rapidly increasing numbers become imbued with the spirit of America awaken to the Christic church ‐‐ again, I refer you to the Christic Institute, run by another secret society, the Jesuits ‐‐ a similar fate may also befall America. Ancient architecture, heraldry and the drama of heaven are all telling the people of America of their possible destiny ‐‐ material and spiritual ‐‐ and no less responsibility [sic]. They're claiming that the Bible is recorded in the constellations of the heavens. The opposite is true, folks. The cosmology of the heavens in the ancient pagan religions existed long before the Bible was even written. The Bible is a conglomeration of all of the metaphors and myths and religions of history, passed down by word of mouth and written ‐‐ particular, the ones adhered to ‐‐ by the Hebrew race. \"As the head, body and limbs of the great image, made of different metals represented each Messianic age, a new [interpretation of] truth, and an empire directly relating to some manifestation of that truth, so must America represent the white stone, [and be] a nation fashioning itself [according to the divine pattern] until it shall have obtained the Messiahship ...\" [William Cooper]: In other words, they're saying America is the Messiah, spiritual leadership. According to them, Christ is coming back to the earth, but not in a physical body, and he never was a divine human being, God incarnate, in the flesh on this earth. Instead, it's an office that can be held by anyone, and in the new age, it shall be held by the new [root?] race. \"[In other words, they say that] America represents the white stone, [and it should be] a nation fashioning itself [according to the divine pattern] until it shall obtained [to the] Messiahship [spiritual leadership] over all nations, overshadowing all that has preceded it. This cannot be accomplished until each citizen shall throw aside the veil [of ignorance and superstition and see] no longer [as through a] glass darkly, but face to face, when Judah shall no [more be permitted to] vex Israel nor Israel envy Judah, but [labor in harmony that the Lord's law be fulfilled If this be not done, both may be destroyed as have been many nations before them].\" [William Cooper]: Remember, the symbol of royalty in England and of England itself is the lion. It was also the symbol of the tribe of Judah, and it was the symbol of ancient Babylon ‐‐ in particular, Nimrod the hunter. I continue: \"The time...spoken of by Isaiah, the prophet, [has come]...[it is a time] when...the learned [intellectual] cannot read the book because it is sealed [as Greek to them], nor the unlearned because he is unlettered, yet shall the book be unsealed [because] the ancient [arcane] wisdom applies to the individual [who is willing to work in obedience to the Christic law] in his [personal] quest of the Holy Grail, in...drinking of the cup of unselfishness, [in] his love for his neighbor and the stranger withing [its] gates [in his loyalty to his family and his country, and his stubborn and wholly insistence that destiny's prophecy shall not be set aside].\" [William Cooper]: So, on the one hand they talked about the Brotherhood of Man, about equal rights for all, about love for his neighbor, and the stranger within his gates. The loyalty to his family and his country, and the same time these lying, deceiving manipulators are destroying the country. They're destroying the family. Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, this comes out of the Mysteries and nowhere else. And they believe that they are the master race, and will ultimately destroy all other races and prevail as the rulers of the world. And yet they read this...they write this and see no contradictions, which makes most of them fools in my estimation. In any case, they're liars, deceivers, manipulators ‐‐ the scum of the earth. They are the destroyers. \"Each [and every one may be] fortunate heir of this glorious inheritance [but] must seek the white stone which crowns the pyramid, within himself, [by the full development of his] body, mind[, spirit] and soul, the Holy Trinity of each Son of [Man, who has become the Son of God].\" [William Cooper]: And there is the clue to what they intend: man will become God. Man, himself, will become \"Christed,\" and that is 318"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"what they mean by the return of Christ to this earth. Not a physical man of divine origin, God incarnate, in the flesh coming on the clouds as the Bible describes, but man himself will become \"Christed.\" And as humankind becomes Christed, and the chaff is weeded out from the wheat, which is them, and destroyed from the earth, all other races, they will prevail and Christ will be upon the earth within them. \"[It is in this manner that] America will realize her destiny as [the] city set upon a hill, a star that shall never [set, but become the light that shall light the world because the true church of the eternal Christos, the Christ within man, for whom there is travail in birth until Christ be formed in you, man shall have become established and be the sanctuary for all her people...]\" [William Cooper]: This is what the Mormon Church teaches. It is just another branch of Mystery Babylon, perverted...perverted by this hidden agenda of the master race, the Anglo ‐ Aryan master race, incarnate in British Israelism, world Zionism, and if you're Jewish, you had better reject it. It's not about saving or preserving the state of Israel, it's about creating a one ‐ world government, and orthodox Jews along with fundamentalist Christians, or any Christian for that matter, who will not renounce Christ as divine, incarnate of God, in flesh upon this earth. Any follower for the prophet Mohamed, anyone who will not bow down to this new religion will be destroyed...will be destroyed. [William Cooper]: [quoting?] The state is the edifice, the church be the spirit. This is the old Nazism coming back to us. This is National Socialism on a world scale, with the state as the edifice, the church must be the spirit. The rise and fall of nations and people has been an exact ratio to their acceptance of the laws as interpreted by their great spiritual leaders, or their efforts to think, desire and act in attempted defiance of them. This is the combination of British Israelism, it is what brought Hitler to power. It is the same occult philosophy that Hitler worshiped the master Aryan race. We used the word \"attempted\" for a reason. That though uncountable millions made every effort to live outside of the law, none thus far have succeeded, and all have passed into the limbo of things forgotten. This illustrates the trite known old saying, \"The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.\" Nearly two thousand years ago the world as a whole has come to a sorry pass. Selfishness was rampant, God was all but forgotten, men lived by greed and at the expense of one another. The few were the masters, spiritual and material of the many. Only a few were able to recognize the light of God. It was a time, very much like our own today when selfishness and desire for conquest were the ruling passions. Some of you old enough may recognize the ravings of father Kauflin. Then as always happens, an exemplification of the eternal order came to one who was to walk upon the shores of Galilee; a just and honorable man , for they attribute no divinity to Christ. One without selfish motive, one who did not seek to establish an earthly kingdom, but in stood a heavenly kingdom in which all who so desired were willing to make the effort and enjoy the good things of earth. [William Cooper]: Do you hear that? He talked of God as none other had before him. He proclaimed God to be the father of all creation, the supreme being of the universe, the maker of heaven and earth, of man in his own image. This young man, this native of Galilee, the Nazarene, preaching the fatherhood of God and the possibility ‐‐ not the certainty ‐‐ of the brotherhood of man and the immortalization of the soul of man. This master teacher manifested greater love, more wisdom and courage than had ever before been found embodied in the body of any man. He possessed the desire to serve mankind as had none other before him. He taught the simplest, grandest and most sublime doctrine, or concept of life, that ever fell from human lips. Yet despite the services, he was ready and willing to render to his fellow man, and his soul ‐ inspiring doctrine he taught, the people to this day, except for a very few, misconstrued his teachings, ridiculed his concepts and finally crucified him. The great Galilean was wise. His wisdom and understanding was beyond the comprehension of men of his day because, then as now, simplicity had no power to excite or incite all the complex hole men enthralled, for seeing the things that were to come he prepared the way so that, should his ministry and teachings be rejected, it would be preserved and passed on to an exceeding age. The age is now upon us ‐‐ the new age, when man shall become the Son of God. Good night, and God bless you all, and may God have mercy upon your soul.

(opening music: The Ride of the Valkyries (Walkürenritt) , by Richard Wagner) [playing audio from the documentary The Occult History of the Third Reich, Part One: The Enigma of the Swastika , narrated by Patrick Allen]: ========================================================== Nazi Germany, 1936. A state which will sterilize, enslave and systematically murder millions of men, women and children. Entire peoples are to be swept from the face of the planet. Whole populations are to be scientifically reduced; those who remain persevered only for their value as slaves. The world is to be subject to a new order. [sound of music and marching] To foreign observers of 1930s Germany, National Socialism is an enigma. No conventional political explanation seems sufficient to account for such an alien phenomenon. A whole world of strange rituals and beliefs seems to have risen from nowhere to mesmerize millions of Germans. Over the whole extraordinary spectacle of pageantry and military might presides the Messianic figure of Adolf Hitler, and everywhere there is a mysterious and ever ‐ present symbol: the emblem of the swastika. [dramatic music] The great rallies of Nuremberg consummate the mystical unity of the party, the people and their leader. The climax of the Nuremberg 320"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"rally is a mass display of up to 32,000 swastikas. A foreign reporter [American journalist William Shirer] finds himself overawed by the force of the spectacle he is witnessing. \"Hitler,\" he writes, \"is restoring pageantry and mysticism to the drab lives of the 20th century...The rally has the mystical and religious fervor of an Easter mass in a great Gothic cathedral.\" [noise, then crowd chanting, \"Heil!\"] The ranks of the Hitler youth sing of their newfound faith: \"No evil priest can prevent us from feeling that we are the children of Hitler. Away with incense and holy water. The swastika brings salvation on earth.\" [Taken from a song sung by the Hitler youth at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally] The symbol of the swastika will win the devotion of millions. Its rise will chart the growth of a strange and terrifying [creed]: the doctrine of National Socialism, a doctrine born in the world of the occult. [music playing] The mission of Aryan man. The mystery of the blood. The soul of the race. These dogmas, fundamental to the Nazi vision, will lead Europe into the realms of [nightmare]. Their symbol is the swastika. The swastika was adopted by the Nazi party in 1920, but it was neither the party's invention nor its discovery. Since the end of the 19th century, the swastika had been spreading amongst the peoples of Europe, and everywhere it was a sign of a new and powerful force ‐‐ a deepening fascination with the arcane, the esoteric and the occult. [music playing] The revival of the occult in Europe has its roots deep in the trauma of the Industrial Revolution. By the dawn of the 20th century, the lives of millions had been changed out of all recognition. Cities, the traditional centers of commerce and fashionable life, have been transformed into sprawling industrial slums. Yet, everywhere, the catchphrase is \"progress.\" There is a widespread belief that a new world is coming, a world in which the ills of the past will be cured by science, by technology and by democracy. Many, far from welcoming the dawn of a new age, are deeply disturbed. With the Industrial Revolution had come a decline in the power of traditional authority. The political power of the landowner is [waning] in favor of a new class of industrialists and financiers. Hierarchy is being threatened by democracy. It appears to many as if the world of beauty and order is disintegrating before their very eyes. Worst of all, religion itself seems in mortal danger. Cherished beliefs, accepted as true for all time, are being questioned by science. The ancient Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. From the late 19th century Tibet is the mysterious and forbidding destination of a steady stream of travelers from the industrialized world. Many, disillusioned with the certainties of science, come in search of another deeper knowledge. One such traveler is a Russian adventuress and self ‐ proclaimed telepath, Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. In 1888, Madame Blavatsky publishes a book, The Secret Doctrine , in which she claims that, deep in an underground Himalayan monastery, she has been shown an ancient occult text. In it will reveal the mystical secrets of the universe and the future course of human history. In The Secret Doctrine , Madame Blavatsky describes the universe as having fallen from pure spirit into base matter, darkness and chaos, but soon it will rise once more to reach the pinnacle of spirituality. Madame Blavatsky claims that this knowledge, and more, she has learned through initiation into the Mysteries of seven esoteric symbols. Of these seven symbols, one she believed to be more potent than any other: the symbol is the swastika. In Tibetan mythology, the swastika is the sign of Agni, the god of the sun, of fire and of creation. And always, with a clockwise or anti ‐ clockwise, with a curved or straight arm, it is the symbol of good fortune. For Madame Blavatsky, each cycle of creation has associated with it seven stages of human evolution. Stages she calls \"root races.\" The race which will begin once more, the ascent from darkness to the light of the spirit, she names, \"Aryan.\" In the occult teachings of Madame Blavatsky, the sign of the Aryan is the swastika. The Nuremberg rally of 1934 has as its theme a mystical concept: the triumph of the will, homages paid to a fundamental dogma in the Nazi creed of the swastika. Pure will, the expression of the soul of the race, will overcome the forces of darkness and of chaos. In the world of National Socialism, the race of light, of order and of the spirit, is the Aryan race. Decades before the swastika was adopted by the Nazi party, a periodical published in Germany by an American occult society [the Theosophical Society] became the first German publication to carry the swastika on its cover. The society's founder was Madame Helena Blavatsky. It would be the followers of Madame Blavatsky who would introduce to the peoples of Germany and Austria the occult doctrine of the Aryan. [music playing (man singing in German)] The Prussian ‐ Austrian war of 1866 had left German ‐ speaking Austrians an isolated minority and a predominantly Slavic Austria Hungary. By the early 20th century an intense longing has grown for unification with Germany. Hundreds of German ‐ Austrian societies are 321"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"founded, committed to the romantic revival of ancient Germanic mythology. A [folk] federation, with a membership of over 100,000 calling themselves the Germanen Bund, holds festivals bound to Germanic calendar, revives ancient rituals and appeals for unity in a new, spiritual German nationhood. The Germanen Bund was inspired by the writings of an Austrian mystic. Guido Von List, born in Vienna in 1848, claimed to have psychic visions of the past in which he was initiated into the secrets of the ancient Teutonic tribes. List's visions told him of a Germanic religion, the worship of the god, Wotan. His dream is to rediscover the occult heritage of its long banished priesthood. According to Norse legend the god ‐ magician Wotan, leader of the dead heroes of Valhalla, had won by suffering a priceless store of esoteric knowledge. He had discovered the secret of the runes. List knew that the runes were the alphabet of a primitive system of writing, but to Germanic peoples from the 2nd century to the middle ages they were also magical symbols. Symbols which List believed possessed a deep esoteric meaning. Feoh, the rune of wealth, wandering in destruction. Ur, the rune of wild oxen, regeneration and sacrifice. North [Nied?], the compulsion of fate. Sieg [Sigil or Sowilo?], the rune of the sun and of victory. To Guido Von List, runes were the key to the occult knowledge of the ancient Germanic peoples. Within a decade of his death in 1919, the runes would had become elements in a new language: the language of national socialism. The Sieg victory rune, emblem of the Hitler youth. The double Sieg, emblem of the Schutzstaffel , the SS. The Epel rune, symbol of Richard Walther Darré's ministry of agriculture, the rune of inheritance, the rune of German soil. The man [eolh?] rune, the rune of death which, in time, will replace the cross in the graveyards of the SS. Study of the runes is required of all SS officers. Of the many strange and mystical symbols which have found a place in the new order of National Socialism, one dominates all others. [dramatic music] Guido Von List called the swastika, \"The twice high holy secret of constant generation.\" He recounts a Nordic tale in which the god Mundelfori whisks the cosmos into being. The swastika is the fire ‐ whisk, the very act of creation. [dramatic music] A Nazi hymn proclaims, \"The time of the cross is gone now, the sun ‐ whisk shall arise and so with God we shall be free at last and give to our people back their honor.\" [dramatic music] By nineteen hundred and nine, the occult visions of Guido Von List have made him famous throughout the German speaking lands. To List every stream, hill and forest in Austria was associated with a Germanic god or spirit. In the devices of heraldic shields, in the beams of Austrian houses, in folk customs and rituals, List claimed to see evidence that Austria was and always had been a part of the German homeland. For two generations, German speaking Austrians had looked to Germany for reassurance and a sense of identity. But events were about to occur which would place in doubt the very future of the fatherland itself. [sounds of gunfire and explosions] 1914: The Great War. For the first time in history, the might of industry is unleashed on the battlefield. Nothing could have prepared the peoples of Europe for slaughter on such an unimaginable scale. As the war grinds on and casualties mount, front line soldiers on both sides of no ‐ man's land take to the wearing of charms and amulets. In the ranks of Germans and Austrians, the most popular of all magic talismans is the swastika. The swastika medallions and amulets worn in the trenches of the Great War are based on the researches of Guido Von List. By now an influential and wealthy society devoted to the teachings of the master has already been formed in Vienna. It is the List Society, which supplies designs to the manufacturers of swastika talismans. The swastika, now spreading amongst the German armies, is fast becoming the emblem of militant German nationalism. But since 1908 it has acquired another even more ominous meaning. Shortly before the outbreak of the Great War, List had incorporated the occult teachings of Madame Helena Blavatsky into this own German mythology. Now he no longer refers to ancient Germans or Teutons. Instead the tribes who populate his visions he names, \"Aryans.\" In Madame Blavatsky's writings, the Aryans are the race of upward spiritual evolution, the race whose sign is the swastika. In Hitler's Mein Kampf the meaning of the swastika to the Nazi party is made clear. \"In the swastika,\" he writes, \"we see the mission for the struggle of the victory of Aryan man.\" 322"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"[voice of Adolf Hitler]: \"We cannot give up what makes life worth living. It is worthwhile because ours in a great mission. The mission was not given to us by a worldly superior but by the God who created our nation.\" By the 1930s in the great Nazi rallies in Nuremberg, the concept of the Aryan has become a cornerstone of the party's mystical ideology. The grand design for the Aryan state has already existed for over twenty years. Its author was Guido Von List. In the slaughter and misery of the Great War, the writings of Guido Von List assumed greater and greater significance for the soldiers of the German and Austrian armies. To List, the Great War is the conflict which will purge the world of evil and herald a new age. Democracy and materialism will be destroyed on the battlefields of Europe. Victory will usher in an [Ario ‐ German] empire. By 1911, List had already described in detail his vision of the future Germanic state. It will be a strict hierarchy in which leaders will be obeyed without question. It will be patriotic with full rights only for the male heads of family. Only Aryans will be entitled to citizenship. There will be strict laws to ensure the purity of the race. Every family will keep a record of its ancestry as proof of its Aryan blood. By 1918 the conflict which List calls, \"the holiest war,\" had cost the lives of two million Germans. That same year the German armies had won a series of military victories. The Russian enemy had collapsed and yet Germany had [sued] for peace. For men who had suffered so much, it seems like a colossal betrayal. Then comes the greatest shock of all: the Kaiser is forced into exile. The terms imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles are harsh and punitive. Key industrial regions must be handed over to the victors. The German army is to be reduced to a fraction of its former strength. Heavy reparations must be paid when war has already left the German economy on the verge of collapse. (break music: The Blue Danube Waltz , by Johann Strauss II) [documentary resumes, narrator continues]: The Versailles Treaty will fatally undermine the authority of the new Vimar Republic. The ministers who signed its terms will become known as the \"November Criminals.\" As food supplies dwindle, and the once proud nation is reduced to dependence and misery, Germany threatens to descend into anarchy. The infant Vimar republic quickly becomes a battleground of warring factions. In the major cities revolutionary, socialist republics are declared by councils of workers and soldiers. Nationalists and monarchist groups muster private armies and mobilize the counter ‐ revolution. Behind the factions on both sides is the hidden hand of conspiracy. Among the many shadowy groups organizing nationalist counter ‐ revolution is the wealthy and powerful Thule Society. Thule is the Munich lodge of the nationalists and anti ‐ Semitic German order. The German order is dedicated to the occult teachings of Guido Von List. On November the 9th, 1918, Rudolph von Sebottendorff, master of Thule, addresses a hastily convened meeting of the lodge. Socialist republics had been declared in both Munich and Berlin. \"Yesterday we experienced the collapse of everything which is familiar, dear and valuable to us. I am determined to pledge Thule to this struggle. Our god is Walvater. His rune is the Ar ‐ rune. The Ar ‐ rune signifies 'Aryan' primal fire, the sun and the eagle. Thule will fight until the swastika rises victoriously out of the icy darkness.\" In the following months, along with other nationalist groups, Thule stockpiles weapons and trains volunteers. On April the 30th, 1919, twenty thousand men, including strong detachments armed and led by Thule, storm Munich in a bloody counter ‐ revolution. On the helmets of many nationalist volunteers is the emblem of the swastika. The success of Thule in the 1919 Munich counter ‐ revolution would have far reaching consequences for the Germany of the 1920s. A shadowy organization devoted to arcane rituals and the creation of an Aryan empire would attract support from the highest levels of German society. [music playing] The secret German order, parent order of Thule, was funded in 1912. It was and would remain virilely anti ‐ Semitic and anti ‐ Democratic. The membership of the Thule and of all the lodges of the German order is drawn from the ranks of aristocrats, industrialists, lawyers, judges and medical men. All are required to prove that they and their spouses are of pure Aryan blood. Applicants must submit details of hair, eye and skin color. Hair must be blond to dark ‐ blond Eyes must be blue or light ‐ brown. The skin must be fair. For membership of the Berlin lodge, even the shape of the skull is taken into account. By the autumn of 1918 Rudolph von Sebottendorff, master of the Thule Lodge, had attempted to extend the influence of Thule ideas by secretly sponsoring the formation of a workers' discussion group. Unknown to most members of the group, its chairman, Karl Harrer, would belong to Thule. The most active member of the workers' group is a locksmith, Anton Drexler. By the end of 1918 Drexler had 323"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"proposed that the workers' circle be formed into a new political party. The Thule chairman agreed. On January the 5th, 1919, the new party is formally founded in a Munich tavern, Der Fürstenfelder Hof . It is to be called the German Workers' Party. On September the 12th, 1919, ten months after the foundation of the party, an army spy is sent by his superiors to attend one of the meetings. The spy is a thirty year old Austrian war veteran. His name is Adolf Hitler. Within weeks, Hitler has joined the party, become a regular speaker at their hall political meetings, and has been appointed to the party's steering committee. Within four months, the party has changed its name. It has become the National Socialists German Workers' Party [NSDAP]. [dramatic music playing] On May the 20th, 1920, the swastika was formally adopted as the symbol of the new Nazi party. The form chosen, straight ‐ armed and anti ‐ clockwise, was chosen by Adolf Hitler himself. Until now, the nationalist swastika had no set direction. The swastika talismans of the Great War were vertical and tilted, clockwise and anti ‐ clockwise. Hermann Goering, future chief of the German Air Force, as a nationalist volunteer in 1919 wore a vertical, anti ‐ clockwise swastika. In the ranks of the nationalist counter ‐ revolutionaries, both clockwise and anti ‐ clockwise forms were commonplace. The curved swastika of Thule, chosen from the many popularized by Guido Von List, would not to be forgotten by the party to which Thule gave birth. It will live on on the belt buckles of the brown ‐ shirted stormtroopers. The ceremonial swords of the Luftwaffe will bear the Thule swastika. Decorations for anti ‐ partisan warfare on the eastern front will display the Thule dagger and the curved swastika. Whatever the form in which the swastika would appear in the banners and regalia of National Socialism, its meaning will remain the same. It is the meaning claimed for it by Madame Blavatsky and Guido Von List. It is the sign of creation, the sign of the mystical destiny of Aryan man. By the 1920s, the spread of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution has had a profound impact on nationalist consciousness. A new explanation for the differences between cultures and for the rise and fall of civilizations is now possible. Increasingly, laws of inheritance are believed to be the key to history. The artistic achievements of a nation, its courage in war, its temperament ‐‐ even its spiritual life ‐‐ are all believed to be the legacy of race. It is a belief that will culminate in the official Nazi doctrine, that each race has its soul, and each soul its race. [music playing] The myth of the Aryan, developed in the occult teachings of Madame Blavatsky and Guido Von List, has by the late 1920s spread throughout Europe, the United States and Britain, and with it fascination with the swastika. The stories of India by the British author Rudyard Kipling appeared emblazoned with the seal of the swastika. In Scotland, the discovery of swastika markings in the Pictish cave inspired the creation of the swastika [kilt ‐ pin]. In the United States, costly earrings and broaches appear in the form of the swastika. During the Great War, the British War Savings Drive has a swastika as its official emblem. Its administrators are awarded swastika lapel badges in recognition of their services to the nation. By 1930, members of the British druidic cults display swastika s on their ceremonial robes. In 1932, an English periodical appears with the title, \"The Superman.\" It is devoted to physical culture and on its cover is a border of swastikas. \"The Superman,\" as well as features on sport and health, carries articles by respected British scientists warning of the racial contamination of Saxon Britain [Adolph Hitler giving a speech]: \"I know this cannot be otherwise because you are flesh from our flesh and blood from our blood. The same spirit that dominates us burns in your young minds. As the columns of our movement sweep through Germany today then I know you will join with them. And we know around us is Germany ‐‐ in us Germany marches and behind us Germany follows!\" [sounds of a large crowd cheering] The Nuremberg rally of 1934. The Fuhrer addressing the mass ranks of the Hitler youth speaks of Germany, of the blood and of continuity of the race. In the coming year, a series of new German laws will be signed into existence by Adolf Hitler. The first Reich Law of Citizenship will divide the people of Germany into two classes: Those of pure Aryan blood will be full citizens of the Reich; non ‐ Aryans will be reduced to mere subjects of the state. A second law, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, will forbid pure ‐ blooded Aryans from marrying people of Jewish descent. Soon after, the measure will be extended to forbid intermarriage between Aryans and all non ‐ Aryans. The Germanic vision of Guido Von List is becoming a reality. [people singing] In 1935, a foundation is established in what is now, \"National Socialist Germany.\" The Ahnenerbe is the ancestral heritage society of the 324"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"study of German pre ‐ history. Its official task is to investigate the territorial extent and spirit of the Nordic Indo ‐ Germanic race. The Ahnenerbe will grow to over fifty departments controlling all archeology in the Third Reich. By 1937, it will be the research branch of the SS. Ahnenerbe researchers, dispatched to Tibet, South America, Greece, and Rome, conclude that all were once populated by great Aryan civilizations. The work of the Ahnenerbe will reinforce what are already deeply held beliefs. Civilization and everything that is valuable are products of the Aryan soul. The way is open for Adolf Hitler to claim: \"If we divide the human race into three categories: founders, maintainers and destroyers of culture, the Aryan stock alone can be considered to represent the first category.\" [music playing] Munich, 1937. National Socialism celebrates the history of the Aryans of the sacred mystery of the swastika. The solemn ritual has been organized by Alfred Rosenberg, official ideologist of the Party, and one ‐ time associate of the Thule society. Today, Rosenberg proclaims: \"A new mythos is dawning: the mythos of the blood, the belief that the godly essence of man himself is to be defended through the blood. The Nordic race represents the mysterium which has overthrown and replaced the old sacraments.\" Already in the rituals of the Hitler Youth, the Christian gospels have been replaced by readings from Mein Kampf . [crowd chanting] In the League of German Maidens, the compulsory youth organization for girls, the religious rights of a mythical Aryan past are reenacted. The sun ‐ whisk swastika is carried in procession. The loom of fate and destiny of Nordic legend is woven once more. By 1939, the very word \"Christmas\" has been banned from official use. In children's books, there are no references to Christ, to angels, or to shepherds. Instead there are emissaries of nature and the power of the sun. Concerted efforts are being made to convert Christmas into a festival of light. In the National Socialist calendar, the summer solstice has become a national holiday. The swastika is revered as the sign of the sun and of creation. Ceremonial fires are lit all over the Reich. In nocturnal rituals, fire incantations are recited by the assembled worshipers of the new Nordic faith. [sounds of fire burning, music playing] The consecration of the Blood Flag [Blutfahne]. On the 9th of November, 1923, the fledgling National Socialist Workers' Party, led by Hitler, attempted to overthrow the government of Bavaria. In a Munich street their advancing ranks were met by a volley of police gunfire. Sixteen are killed, including the stormtrooper marching beside Hitler. In the chaos, the swastika flag, carried in the front rank of marchers, is knocked to the ground and drenched in blood. The Blood Flag, entrusted to the guardian of the SS, becomes the most sacred relic of the Nazi party. All new Nazi banners must be consecrated by contact with the original Blood Flag. \"We do not want to have any other god, only Germany,\" proclaims Adolph Hitler, \"and in the doctrine of National Socialism, Germany is the race. Already the priesthood of the Aryan empire of the future is in the process of creation. It is to come the mystical brotherhood of the SS.\" [full quote?] The SS, first created as the bodyguard of the Fuhrer, will become a state within a state. Its members are chosen as the most perfect living examples of Aryan man. Even a single filled tooth will bar a candidate from entry to the racial elite of the Reich. Each applicant for SS membership must prove his German ancestry to 1750. He must undergo thorough instruction in racial biology. He must study the mystical destiny of Aryan man. He must be obedient without question and loyal to the death. In the Aryan empire of the future, the SS are to be the incorruptible guardians of the purity of the race. It is from their ranks that a new breed will come. It is they who will pave the way for the next phase in human evolution. For the followers of the creed of the swastika, the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler has been sent by providence. It is his mission to lay the foundations for the coming Aryan [millennium] During the Great War, Guido Von List revived an ancient Nordic prophecy. \"The strong one from above ends the faction. He settles everything with fair decisions. Whatever he ordains shall live forever.\" In reality, the thousand ‐ year Reich will live for twelve years. In those twelve years, Adolf Hitler will preside over a nightmare of mass murder, world war and the destruction of Germany itself. And yet, long before the rise of Hitler, or even the foundation of the National Socialist's Party, the seeds have been sown. Germany had inherited a legacy which will pave the way to the most horrifying chapter in human history. 325"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The occult teachings of Madame Blavatsky, Guido Von List and their disciples, the Aryan fantasies of secret societies, the racial myths of militant nationalism.

And, to put it bluntly...and, as an understatement, you ain't heard nothing yet. Don't you dare miss tomorrow night or Wednesday night's episode of the Hour of the Time. If you listened closely tonight and if you listen closely again tomorrow night you will know why the chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, the new chairman appointed by Clinton, lied about his father, whom he said he's not really a member of the SS, he was conscripted. There's no such thing as a conscripted member of the SS, ladies and gentlemen. The man is a liar. He's covering up his father's Nazi past and his willing, willing enlistment in the SS and therefore, must be, probably is, one of the ones who have received the heritage passed down from his father. And I don't believe he would be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff if he were not a National Socialist. Remember what you're learning is that really is nothing new under the sun.

Welcome to the Hour of the Time. We are now worldwide by shortwave radio and one ‐ half of the Earth's hemisphere on Satellite Galaxy 3, Channel 17 5.8 Audio. That's Galaxy 3, Channel 17 5.8 Audio. We are striking at the heart and soul of the enemy with the Hour of the Time, and it was reflected today when they paid us the greatest compliment that we can ever, ever hope to possess. We were attacked by Radio for Peace International, a broadcast of the United Nations, repeatedly today on 4 frequencies worldwide. Ladies and gentlemen, I am so happy and so proud that we have hurt them so badly that they chose to win credibility to this broadcast by publicly attacking us on a United Nations broadcast, Radio for Peace International, worldwide. The Socialist bloodsuckers are hurting badly. Before we get into tonight broadcast, I want to read you a definition from Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, revised edition , Volume 1, A ‐ L. This is personally signed by Albert Mackey and was published in 1924 by the Masonic History Company, Chicago, New York and London, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I also have Mackey's 1893 edition of his Encyclopedia of Freemasonry in which the word Aryan is mentioned for the first time, taken out of the teachings of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. And in that series of volumes of Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry there is a section on crosses, and there is only one Cross mentioned...only one ‐‐ it is the swastika. Now from the 1924 volume, Aryan: ‐‐ and I quote ‐‐ \"One of the three historical divisions of religion ‐‐ the other two being the Turanian and the Shemitic.

Here, senior party members and their families relax, away from the frantic activity of the camp. Yet, even in the peaceful setting of the Bavarian Alps amongst the tranquil scenes of domestic life there is an unsettling presence: the racial elite of the New Order, the SS. 327"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"[dramatic music playing, sounds of marching] \"How can we arrest racial decay?\" asks Adolf Hitler. \"Shall we form a select company of the truly initiated? An Order, the Brotherhood of Templars around the Holy Grail of pure blood.\" By 1934, almost ten years after its creation, the SS is in the process of becoming Hitler's Brotherhood of Templars. The handpicked, disciplined and fiercely loyal bodyguard of the Fuhrer is being transformed into an Aryan elite. A mystical order, dedicated to the creation of an empire. In the strange and terrifying doctrines of National Socialism, the Aryan is the race of the future. Providence has decreed that the Aryans will subjugate all other peoples. [dramatic music playing] In the vanguard of the Nazi mission would be the black ‐ clad ranks of the SS. This carefully selected elite is intended to be the stock from which will come a new and superior breed of human ‐‐ the superman ‐‐ a caste of men born to rule. It is Heinrich Himmler who will forge Hitler's guard into a racial aristocracy. Under Himmler's leadership, the SS will become a state within a state. Obsessed with secrecy and bound by solemn ritual, the SS will become a force of unprecedented power and authority. [sounds of crowd cheering] The origins of this, the most sinister of all Nazi's creations, do not lie in the personal visions of Heinrich Himmler or his Fuhrer. The roots of the SS go deeper ‐‐ even the National Socialism itself. By 1900, the cities of Germany and Austria have changed beyond all recognition. Millions have abandoned the poverty of peasant life, the slave in the mills and foundries of the Industrial Revolution. As their population swell with the influx of labor, elegant centers of commercial and aristocratic life become teeming industrial slums. It is in the cities that the values of the old order are challenged. Calls for democracy and Socialism threaten the traditional power of the ruling elites. Established religious beliefs are undermined by science and a rising tide of materialism. To many, the new world seems fractured and chaotic. Amongst the aristocratic and educated classes in the first decade of the 20th century, the overriding mood is one of nostalgia. There is a powerful yearning for a vanished past, a past believed to have been more harmonious, orderly, and spiritual. All over industrialized Europe new movements arise, devoted to the search for simplicity. In Germany, the movement calls itself, Lebensreform ‐‐ life reform. It is pledged to the restoration of a more natural way of living. Tens of thousands of German youth join the Wandervögel ‐‐ the birds of passage. Its members share a mystical love of the German countryside and revere German folklore and ritual. While science and medicine are rejected as products of the Industrial Revolution, vegetarianism, herbal healing, nudism, communal living, and meditation become fashionable pursuits. In every major city, cults devoted to spiritualism, astrology, magic, and the occult flourish among the disciples of life reform. Of all the doctrines favored by the movement, none will be more influential than those preached by the Russian evangelist and telepath Madame Helena Blavatsky. In 1888 Madam Blavatsky claimed to have traveled to Tibet, and there to have been initiated into the secrets of spiritual masters she calls the \"Hidden Elect.\" In the doctrines of occultists, the Hidden Elect, or the Great White Brotherhood, are believed to be humans who, by initiation and self denial, have risen become Adepts. They have gained powers and knowledge beyond those of ordinary mortals. In Britain, Aleister Crowley, a magician of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, claimed in 1909 to have crossed the abyss and to have returned as an Adept. Madame Blavatsky did not claim to be an Adept in her own right, but she did claim constant telepathic communication with her hidden masters. They had revealed to her, their chosen one, the occult history of the human race. According to Madame Blavatsky, each round of the cosmic cycle has associated with it seven root races. The first root race to evolve on earth, she calls the Astral race. It was a race of pure spirit, the highest form of existence. The second race she calls the Hyperborean race. Its home was a now vanished continent in the northern ocean. The third race was the Lemurians. Blavatsky is clear about the reason for the fall of the Lemurian race: it had interbred with animals. The fourth race in the history revealed to Madam Blavatsky is the race of Atlantis. The Atlanteans had possessed psychic powers and had constructed giant cities using an energy source of mysterious origins. The Atlanteans were destroyed in a great flood. The fifth root race Madam Blavatsky sees as the race of hope ‐‐ the race that has once founded the culture of ancient Greece, and soon would return man to the pinnacle of spirituality. That race she named, the Aryan. By 1914, Blavatsky's mystical doctrine of the destiny of the Aryan man has spread throughout Germany and Austria.

All over Europe, news of war is greeted with unqualified enthusiasm. In all the warring nations, the emotions of militant nationalism are given free reign. In the ranks of the Austrian and German armies, there is a widespread belief that the aspirations of a generation may be satisfied at last: the unification of German speaking peoples and the creation of a Germanic empire. [sounds of explosions] To the frontline soldiers of the Imperial armies, the teachings of the Austrian clairvoyant Guido von List are an inspiration. List believes that in the Germans, more than in any other people, runs the blood of the mythical race called by Madam Blavatsky, the Aryans. To List, the Great War is proof that the modern world, with its materialism and its Democracy, is destroying itself. But out of war and destruction will come the victory of the German cause and the beginning of an Aryan millennium. List revives the prayer of the 16th century philosopher and heretic Giordano Bruno: \"O Jove! That the Germans realize their own strength, and they shall not be men, but gods.\" [music playing] Like Aleister Crowley and Madame Blavatsky, List's psychic researches have led him to believe in the existence of a hidden elect. His visions of the ancient German tribes have revealed to him an elite class of priest ‐ rulers. List calls it the Armanenschaft . The role of the Armanenschaft was to preserve the occult knowledge of the German's Aryan ancestors. List claims that the imposition of Christianity on the Teutonic tribes and the persecution of the followers of the old religion forced the Armanenschaft to continue its traditions in secret. Their law had lived on in the rituals and symbols of a network of secret societies. The store of occult knowledge had been preserved down the centuries by Freemasons, Rosicrucians, and chivalrous orders, such as the Knights Templar. So great is List's influence among German and German ‐ Austrian nationalists, that many army officers have joined the secret occultist organization inspired by his teachings. The German Order, founded in May 1912, has lodges in ten German cities. The government of the order is by a secret twelve man council of initiates, calling itself the Arminius Assembly. The future Aryan empire will according to List be governed by a similar council of initiates, a new Armanenschaft. In the design of the future SS, List's Arminius Assembly will not be forgotten. [sounds of explosions] List's prediction that the Great War would see the victory of Imperial Germany over its democratic and degenerent enemies will not be fulfilled. By 1918, the German economy is in ruins and the Kaiser's armies are crumbling. To the men at the front, the failure of the Imperial war machine is inexplicable. In 1918, Germany had won several major battles. The Russian enemy had already collapsed. Theories of a conspiracy abound. Many believe that Germany has been betrayed from within. The blame is placed squarely on the shoulders of the traditional targets of the German nationalist movements: Capitalists, Democrats, and Jews. To the followers of Guido von List, all that is valuable seems irretrievably lost. A government of unknown politicians has accepted the humiliating terms of the Versailles Treaty. Worst of all, the Kaiser and the German princess have abdicated. Germany has become a Democratic Republic. The abdication of the Kaiser is a stunning blow to the occultist of the German Order. Guido von List had taught that the aristocracy of Germany had been founded in ancient times by the Armanenschaft itself. In the aristocracy was to be found the purest of Aryan blood ‐‐ and with it, the strongest remaining traces of the Aryan psychic powers. In the aftermath of the Great War, faced with the twin threat of Democracy and Socialism, traditionalists eagerly embraced List's mystical belief in the German nobility. But, by now, a new concept of aristocracy is in a process of development. Side by side with the teachings of List, it will become the cornerstone of Nazi ideology and the future SS. Since the mid 19th century, the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin had challenged religious beliefs held sacred for centuries. But, by the end of the Great War, many physicians, scientists, and politicians have come to see in Darwinism a formula for social and political action. Belief in the equality of man is seen as simply unscientific. The new slogan is, \"The survival of the fittest.\" In Darwin's The Descent of Man , published in 1871, he speculates on the effect of modern medicine on the future course of human evolution: \"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our best to check the process of elimination. Thus, the weak members of civilized society propagate their kind. This,\" argues Darwin, \"must be highly injurious to the race of man...excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\" In Britain, the family planning movement, led by the scientist Marie Stopes, is preoccupied with the supposed threat to the health of the race posed by uncontrolled breeding. Marie Stopes work on birth control, Wise Parenthood , first published in 1918, is dedicated \"to all 329"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"those who wish to see our race grow in strength and beauty.\" Stopes is concerned with the tendency revealed by the national census for the lower classes to produce more children than the upper classes. \"The numbers of our population,\" she states, \"increasingly tend to be made up from the less thrifty and the less conscientious.\" In America, the compulsory sterilization of the mentally handicapped, of alcoholics, and the persistent criminals has been legal in certain states since 1907. Marie Stopes advocates similar policies for Britain, including the sterilization of male children with an epileptic or mentally handicapped parent, uncle or aunt. The family planning movement is part of a broader movement aimed at directing and accelerating the evolution of the human race by selective breeding. This new science calls itself Eugenics. By 1918, Eugenics has become so influential that the British Medical Journal publishes an article in which a noted physician can write: \"There is no equality in nature among children nor among adults, and if there is to be a much needed improvement in the race we must breed from the physically, morally, and intellectually fit.\" From Britain, Eugenics spreads to Germany, acquiring the new name \"racial hygiene.\" University departments and institutes are founded devoted to the new science. By the 1920s, Eugenics has won widespread support amongst the German medical establishment. It has also had a profound effect on the doctrines of the German occultists. In 1919, Guido von List, a prophet of the Aryan millennium, dies in Berlin at the age of 70. His place as Germany's leading mystic and Aryan visionary has been taken by Jörg Lanz. Lanz, an ex ‐ Cistercian monk and respected biblical scholar, will have a profound impact on the development of Nazi ideology and on the structure and ritual of the future SS. Lanz has blended the Aryan occultism of Guido von List and the principles of the science of Eugenics. He calls his new doctrine \"theozoology.\" Theozoology is an occult religion of race. Inspired by Madam Blavatsky's mystical history of racial evolution, Lanz claims that the decline of the Aryans occurred because they had committed bestiality with the subhuman species. The result was the creation of many mixed races ‐‐ races whose very existence threatens the rightful dominance of the Aryans. Like List, Lanz believed that the early Aryans possessed the power of telepathy. Interbreeding with racial inferiors had led to the loss of their paranormal abilities. \"Why do you seek a hell in the next world?\" Lanz asks. \"Is not the hell in which we live and which burns inside us sufficiently dreadful?\" To Lanz, the hell which burns inside is the impure blood in the veins of even the purest Bavarians. The teachings of Jörg Lanz are propagated throughout Germany and Austria by his own journal, Ostara , founded in 1905. Lanz claims that over 100,000 copies of Ostara a year are sold. He even claims that amongst his eminent subscribers is the British General Kitching. In the pages of Ostara , and in a series of widely read essays, Lanz develops a terrifying prescription for the purification of the race. He proposes polygamy to increase the birth rate of the racially purists. Eugenic convents are to be established, in which chosen women he calls \"root mothers\" will produce children for pure ‐ blooded Aryan males. While the racially impure, and the physically or mentally unfit are to be sterilized, other races deemed inferior are to be deported to Madagascar, or used as slave labor. In the future Nazi state, all of Lanz's proposals will be given the most serious consideration. Some will be put into practice. A massive compulsory sterilization campaign will be directed at those judged physically, mentally or racially inferior. The deportation of German Jews to Madagascar will be discussed in the upper echelons of the Party. The SS will plan for the official introduction of polygamy and will fund its own SS breeding program. To Jörg Lanz, the legends of the Knights of the Holy Grail are more than the products of the medieval imagination. Lanz believed that they were the Knights Templar, founded in the 12th century and famed for their part in the Christian Crusades. Lanz believed that the Crusades were an attempt to hold back the inferior races of the East. The Holy Grail was an electrical force, representing the psychic powers of the pure ‐ blooded Aryans. The search for the Grail was the search for racial purity. In 1907, Lanz formed an occult society dedicated to a new Crusade. He called it the Order of the New Templars. In the castle of Burg Werfenstein in upper Austria, Lanz founded the Order's first headquarters. Other order priories soon followed. The occult rituals of the New Templars are based on Lanz's monastic experience, and his own especially composed psalms, prayers, and readings. A constant theme is an appeal to the Aryan Christ, Frauja, for salvation from racial impurity and for the extermination of inferior races. The aims of the Order are explicit: to harmonize science, art and ethics into an occult religion devoted to the purification of the Aryan race in all countries of the world. In anticipation of the practices of the SS, prospective members and their marriages are racially vetted. For Lanz, the New Templars are the beginning of a new order. \"No longer will parliaments determine the fate of the people,\" Lanz proclaims. \"In their place will rule wise priest ‐ kings and leaders of chivalrous and spiritual secret orders.\" In reality, it would not be the occultists of the New Templars who will create the Aryan aristocracy of the future. The mystical doctrines preached by Lanz will be put into practice by others ‐‐ above all by a man who, since the age of 20, has been an avid collector of Ostara . In the closing months of 1918, Corporal Adolf Hitler, holder of the Iron Cross First Class, will come to the attention of his superior 330"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"officers, and their mutiny at the demobilization camp, at which Hitler is stationed, is brought under control by his powerful oratory. In September 1919, Hitler, now a civilian, is called upon once more by the army command, this time to spy on an insignificant nationalist group calling itself the German Workers Party. Within months, Hitler has joined the party and has begun to speak at meetings. By January in 1920, he has been elected head of propaganda and has drawn up a new party constitution. The army intelligence Captain who had first recruited Hitler as a spy has been retired. His replacement as Hitler's army sponsor is the 32 ‐ year ‐ old Captain Ernst Röhm. (break music: The Blue Danube Waltz , by Johann Strauss II) Röhm is held in high regard as a courageous frontline officer and an outstanding organizer. The Bavarian army command has given Röhm the task of circumventing the arms restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. He is to establish secret arms dumps and organize the many nationalist paramilitary groups in Bavaria into an unofficial army of reserves. One such group of the irregulars is the Powerful Force, commanded by ex ‐ naval Captain Hermann Ehrhardt. The Ehrhardt Brigade has played a major role in combating Socialist revolution in Bavaria. It is Ernst Röhm who brings together Ehrhardt and Adolf Hitler. Public meetings of the early Nazi party are defended by stewards known as the Athletics and Sports Detachment. In the summer of 1921, Ernst Röhm arranges that officers of the Ehrhardt Brigade should become the Commanders of a new party defense force, the SA (Storm Detachment). To Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party, the function of the SA is to protect party speakers and make an impressive show of force when the occasion demands. But the SA has another role ‐‐ it is an unofficial part of the German army. It is trained by army officers, numbered in army mobilization plans and controlled by Hermann Ehrhardt. Hitler is well aware that the allegiance of the SA does not lie with him or with the party. He knows that, as party leader, he needs a force upon which he can rely utterly. The Stosstrupp Hitler is the prototype for the SS. November 1923: Adolf Hitler is jailed for his part in an attempt to overthrow the government of Bavaria. The Nazi party and the SA are banned. Hitler's Stosstrupp bodyguard is scattered. During his imprisonment, Hitler writes his political testament Mein Kampf , and ponders the future of the party and of the SA. It is clear that eventually he must revive the SA ‐‐ that he must also reform and strengthen his own personal guard. Hitler's requirements for his new force are clear: \"I told myself then that I needed a bodyguard, even a very restricted one, but made up of men ready to march against their own brothers.\" On December the 20th, 1924, Hitler is released from prison. He has served only 9 months of a 5 year sentence, but his trial and imprisonment have made him a national figure. Two months after his release, Hitler formally reconstitutes the Nazi party and reforms the SA under a new command. Röhm and Hitler have argued and parted company. In April 1925, Hitler orders his chauffeur and ex ‐ bodyguard, Julius Schreck, to form a new force for the defense of the Fuhrer and the protection of party headquarters. It is the Schutzstaffel, or \"Protection Squad\" ‐‐ the SS. To set themselves apart from the SA, the SS wear black caps bearing a silver Death's Head insignia. To the intense irritation of the SA, the SS is soon behaving as an elite. SS entry requirements are far stricter than those of the SA. SS discipline is more severe. The SS attend all party meetings but never speak. Already its unofficial motto is: \"The aristocracy keeps its mouth shut.\" On July the 4th 1926, Hitler confirms the SS as his elite organization. At the second party rally at Weimar, he gives the SS guardianship of the party's most sacred relic, the flag drenched in the blood of the party fighters killed in the coup of 1923. As custodians of the Blood Banner, the SS are entrusted with the Nazi symbol of martyrdom in the struggle for Aryan supremacy. The transformation of the SS from the elite guard of the Fuhrer into the mystical order it will eventually become will be the work of one man: he is Heinrich Himmler, the most enigmatic of all Nazi leaders. Himmler is a devoted follower of the Aryan occultism of Guido von List and Jörg Lanz. He, too, dreams of a Germanic empire ruled by a mystical order of the Aryan elite. He is determined that this elite should be drawn from the ranks of the SS. The superman ‐‐ the new breed of Germanic ruler ‐‐ is to be created from the stock which he will select. Himmler is appointed head of the SS in January 1929. For almost a year, he and his wife had been [small holders] and poultry farmers. Since early youth, Himmler has been an eager convert to the teachings of the movement for life reform. The land he believes is the origin of all that is good. Cities are the source of all that is unhealthy, corrupt and immoral. \"The yeoman on his own acre,\" writes Himmler, \"is the background of the German people's strength and character.\" Himmler has long been associated with the Artamanen League, a nationalist and anti ‐ Slavic movement of city youth, committed to life on the land and the 331"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"expansion of German farming to the East. The oath of the Artamanen League is sworn: \"by blood and soil.\" In the Artamanen League, Himmler has met the man who will transform the oath, \"by blood and soil,\" into a central doctrine of the SS. To Walther Darre, an ex ‐ official in the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture, the relationship between German blood and German soil is a source of mystical power. [quote?] \"Questions of agriculture are not questions of economics, but of race and destiny.\" In 1930, Himmler's fantasies of an Aryan future are the least of Hitler's concerns. The unity of the party and Hitler's own future as its leader are under threat. With the economic depression at its height, Germany's unemployed flood into the ranks of the SA. The Stormtroopers now number 100,000 men. To the radicals of the SA, National Socialism promises the destruction of the traditional German ruling classes. In the eyes of the Stormtroopers, the industrialists, army officers, and aristocrats who are the Nazi party's most influential supporters are no more than contemptible parasites. In protest of the political alliances which Hitler has formed, many SA Commanders withdraw their men from the party service. Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda chief, warns Hitler that a split within the SA and within the party is imminent. Hitler's solution is to recall the only man he believes capable of reuniting the SA: Ernst Röhm. Röhm will succeed in the task Hitler has set for him. He will pay for success with his life. As Röhm sets about the unification and expansion of the SA, Himmler takes a different road. His strategy is not one of rapid expansion. Instead, he concentrates on careful and systematic selection. In 1930, Himmler had won a valuable concession from Hitler: the SS would be allowed to recruit from the ranks of the SA. Himmler proceeds to put into practice his theories of breeding. \"We went about it like a nursery gardener, trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased...I started with a minimum height requirement. I knew that men of a certain height must, somewhere, possess the blood I desire.\" On December the 31st 1931, Himmler establishes the SS Race and Resettlement Bureau. It is to be headed by his old friend, Walther Darre. Darre is awarded the rank of honorary SS General. The task of the Race and Resettlement Bureau is to prepare for the future colonization of the East by pure ‐ blooded Germans. It is also instructed to conduct research into racial ancestry, biological selection, and the history of the Aryans. Its staff of leading academics and medical men are ordered by Himmler to develop stricter requirements for SS entry. Bureau physicians assess the degree of racial purity of each applicant by physical examination. Only those considered pure or predominantly Nordic are acceptable. The applicant's physique is also judged on a 9 ‐ point scale. The examiners are instructed to take into account the attitude and bearing of the candidate. Himmler has decreed, \"In his attitude to discipline, the man should not behave like an underling. His gait, his hands, everything, should correspond to the ideal which we have set ourselves.\" To Himmler, selection is only the first step in his plan to reclaim the Aryan blood, latent in the German people. The second stage is the control of SS breeding. The Race and Resettlement Bureau is charged with the task of racially vetting SS marriages. Prospective brides of SS men are required to prove the purity of their Aryan blood back to the year 1750. By 1933, the Bureau will be examining almost 2000 SS marriage applications a month. It is the beginning of the largest and most terrifying Eugenics experiment in human history. From 1935, the Race and Resettlement Bureau will be empowered to vet the marriages of the entire civilian population of Germany. Heinrich Himmler is so confident of success that he predicts that in a hundred and twenty years the entire German people should once more be pure ‐ blooded Aryans. Himmler knows that the realization of his Aryan vision depends above all on the SS becoming the most powerful organization in the Nazi party and in the German state. Already, Hitler has given the SS the role of carrying out police and intelligence duties within the party. Himmler is quick to seize the opportunity to expand his power. In 1931, Himmler recruits a 33 ‐ year ‐ old ex ‐ Naval officer, Reinhard Heydrich, to found an SS security service. The establishment of the SD will be the first stage in Himmler's creation of an SS state within a state. [dramatic music] In 1932, two elections for the presidency of Germany deliver to Hitler 30 percent of the national vote. In the July parliamentary elections, Hitler campaigns in 50 cities in the space of two weeks. His efforts are amply rewarded. The party wins over 13 million votes and 230 seats in the Reichstag. Hitler demands the post of Chancellor. Parliament refuses. Yet another election on November the 6th sees the Nazi vote fall by 2 million. The Communists increase their vote by almost 1 million and win 100 seats. With no party having an overall majority, the conservatives in parliament choose an alliance with the Nazis. Hitler's price for cooperation is the Chancellorship. This time he is not refused. 332"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"In spite of his growing power within the party, Heinrich Himmler is not awarded a ministerial post in the new government. But the man Hitler calls, \"My loyal Heinrich,\" does not complain to his Fuhrer. Himmler's ambition extends far beyond the control of a mere government department. During his youth, Himmler had spent 3 years as a student of agriculture. In the college fencing fraternity, to which Himmler belonged, Jörg Lanz's occultist periodical, Ostara , was widely read. Of all the prophecies made by Lanz, one would become Himmler's obsession. On astrological grounds, Lanz foretold the invasion of Europe from the East. Himmler comes to believe that it is the destiny of the SS to repel the coming assault. The great battles he foresees will be a prelude to the final victory of the Aryans. Already, Himmler has identified the figure of German history who will become his idol and his inspiration. King Heinrich I, German King of the Saxons, had in the 10th century fought and conquered the Slavic tribes of the East. So great will Himmler's devotion to the king become, that he will make an annual pilgrimage to Heinrich's tomb. He will believe himself the reincarnation of the king and the recipient of psychic messages from the spirit of the dead ruler. Himmler believes that his divine mission is to complete the work of King Heinrich. He will create from the SS, a knightly order which will rule the coming Aryan empire. But for a time, at least, Himmler's visions of the future must take second place to practical politics. From 1933, Himmler's objective is to win control of Germany's many state police forces. The major obstacle to his ambition is Hermann Goering. Goering is now minister president of Prussia and chief of the Prussian secret police, the Gestapo. Goering sees himself as prime candidate for the job of chief of a new unified German police force. In Goering's campaign to eliminate Prussian Communists and all others opponents of National Socialism, he employs the SA as auxiliaries to the police and the Gestapo. The Berlin SA are the most brutal and the most feared storm troop detachments in Germany. Their hatred of the middle classes almost equals their hatred of Jews and Communists. But Goering is unconcerned. \"It is not my business to do justice,\" he proclaims. \"It is my business to annihilate and exterminate. That is all.\" In the capital and throughout Prussia, Goering unleashes a reign of terror in which thousands are interned in SA concentration camps. The situation is fast becoming a national scandal. The party supporters amongst the middle and upper classes are outraged. Hitler is persuaded that command of a unified German police force cannot be entrusted to Goering. Himmler has won a major victory. One by one, the state police forces will fall under his control. In April 1934, Himmler wins the greatest prize of all. He succeeds in forcing Goering to hand over the control of the Gestapo. Now only one force stands between Himmler and the power he seeks. [dramatic music playing] Spring 1934: Ernst Röhm, leader of the SA, conducts his own version of Hitler's flag consecration ritual. It is the sign to the 4 million strong SA of Röhm's power and independence. Röhm's intention is to create from the SA a new National Socialist German army, with himself as its Commander ‐ in ‐ Chief. The regular army command is becoming increasingly anxious. Undercover of inspecting a naval exercise, Hitler holds a secret meeting with the army Generals. He gives them his assurance that, in exchange for their support, the army will continue to be Germany's only military force. Hitler promises that Röhm will be dealt with. The agent of his destruction is to be Himmler's SS. Himmler and his deputy Heydrich contrived evidence that Röhm and the SA are planning a coup against Hitler. A list of the supposed conspirators is drawn up. It includes not only the leadership of the SA but all those who have opposed the growing power of the SS. The bloodbath that Himmler unleashes on June the 30th, 1934, will become known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 500 will be murdered by SS executions. The murder of the SA leadership is greeted with relief by the German army. On the death of President Hindenburg, on the 2nd of August, 1934, and the confirmation of Hitler as President of Germany, the army willingly changes its oath of allegiance. Loyalty is now sworn, not to the German state or to the constitution, but to Adolf Hitler himself. [German soldiers chanting the oath of allegiance] The true victor of the Night of the Long Knives is not the German army ‐‐ it is the SS. On July the 20th, 1934, a grateful Fuhrer decrees that the SS is to be an independent organization within the party. What is more, ignoring his pledge that the army is to be the Reich's only military force, he gives permission to the SS to form its own military unit. In time the Waffen, or armed, SS will number almost one million men. 333"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"By the summer of 1934, Himmler has won total independence for his SS elite.

Welcome to the last episode of Mystery Babylon! [playing audio from the 1991 History Channel documentary The Occult History of the Third Reich, Part Four: Himmler The Mystic , narrated by Patrick Allen] ========================================= Nazi Germany, a state in which children have become a national obsession. Hitler has proclaimed: \"...it must be considered reprehensible to withhold healthy children from the nation. If the fertility of the healthiest bearers of the nationality is consciously and systematically promoted, the result will be a race which has eliminated the germs of our present physical and hence spiritual decay.\" In the doctrines of National Socialism, this spiritual decay has but one cause: the dilution of the Aryan race by the blood of inferior peoples. Only by breeding from the racially purest can the greatness of the Aryans be restored. In the vanguard of the Nazi racial mission is Hitler's \"Praetorian Guard,\" the SS. Before he can enter the SS elite, a candidate must have his German ancestry proved back to the year 1750. Before marriage, the prospective bride of an SS man is subject to rigorous racial investigation. From the offspring of Hitler's guard, many generations in the future is intended to come the racially purest of German stock, a superior breed of human born to rule. The origins of this terrifying vision are strange and contradictory, an unlikely union between the teachings of a modern scientific movement and the esoteric doctrines of the occult. By the late 1920s, the German scientific and medical world had wholeheartedly embraced a new movement: the science of eugenics. The founder of eugenics is an Englishman ‐‐ Sir Francis Galton, the cousin of Charles Darwin. The aim of eugenics, Galton had written, is \"to breed out feeble constitutions and petty and ignoble instincts, and to breed in those which are vigorous, noble and social.\" To the disciples of eugenics ‐‐ the intelligent and the industrious ‐‐ the mentally ill, the criminal and the alcoholic are so because they carry within them the traits of their parents. The fear is that inferior types, by breeding faster than those of more valuable stock, will 335"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"produce a catastrophic decline in the quality of the human race. Only by the most drastic measures, it is believed, can disaster be averted. The solution favored by the eugenics movement is the legal control of human breeding. Laws must be passed for the compulsory sterilization of the feeble ‐ minded, the alcoholic, the insane, and the pauper. At the same time, valuable members of society are to be encouraged to have the largest possible number of children. In the 1920s, while eugenics in Europe is still in the realms of scientific theory, in the United States of America it has long since been put into practice. The state of North Dakota had banned marriage for alcoholics, the insane, and those suffering from tuberculosis, as early as the turn of the century. In 1907, the state of Indiana had passed the world's first law allowing sterilization of the mentally ill and criminally insane. By 1930, twenty ‐ eight American states had passed similar laws, and fifteen thousand people in mental hospitals and prisons had been compulsory sterilized. By 1939, the figure will have reached thirty thousand. The health office of the government of the German Weimar Republic makes a detailed study of American eugenic laws. It is deeply impressed by America's sterilization campaign, and leading German eugenicists praise U.S. restrictions on the immigration of foreigners and the laws passed in some southern states banning intermarriage between the races. There is a growing concern in German medical circles that Germany is being left behind in the struggle for racial improvement. By 1927, eugenics, now with a new name, \"racial hygiene,\" is rapidly gaining respectability in Germany. More and more university medical faculties offer courses in the subject. An institute specializing in racial hygiene is founded by the German health office. The task of the Kaiser ‐ Wilhelm Institute is to study means of halting what an influential reporter called \"the physical and mental degeneration of the German people.\" Racial hygiene has also become a central pillar in the strange ideology of a rising political party. Adolf Hitler had spent much of the year 1924 in prison for his part in an attempted coup against the Bavarian government. While in prison, he'd read a recently published and widely praised textbook on human heredity and racial hygiene. He'd also written his political testament, Mein Kampf . In Mein Kampf , Hitler's commitment to the doctrines of racial hygiene is made clear. \"The state,\" he writes, \"must set race at the center of all life. It must see to it that there is only one disgrace: to bring children into the world despite one's own sickness and deficiencies. Here, the state must act as guardian of a millennial future in the face of which the wishes and selfishness of the individual appear as nothing.\" To Hitler, the millennial future which the state must defend is the coming triumph of Aryan man. The Nazi faith in the destiny of the Aryan race is not the creation of Adolf Hitler, nor does it spring from the movement for racial hygiene. Its origins lie in the teachings of mystics, clairvoyants and secret societies dedicated to the occult. In the violent aftermath of the first World War, an increasing fascination with the mystical and the esoteric had swept the German aristocratic and educated classes. So widespread is the influence of mystical doctrines that even one of German's most powerful generals believes that national salvation lies in reviving the worship of the Norse god, Wotan. General Erich Ludendorff, hero of the Great War and former chief of the German general staff, freely admits that he believes he is in psychic communion with the Nordic race soul. In 1923, Ludendorff had led an abortive coup in Bavaria. His ally was the little known political agitator Adolf Hitler. Many of the members of Ludendorff's circle, including his future wife, are closely associated with an influential occultist group calling itself the Edda Society. The Edda Society is founded in December 1925 by Rudolf John Gorsleben. Some years earlier, Gorsleben had been active in extreme nationalist politics. He had been a speaker at meetings of the occultist Thule Society, and had founded a political movement with the anti ‐ Semite Julius Streicher. Streicher would later become a key figure in the infant Nazi party. Gorsleben then abandons politics. He immerses himself in the task of deciphering the ancient Nordic script of the runes and penetrating the secrets of the Icelandic verses known as the Edda. In these, Gorsleben believes can be rediscovered the priceless, magical heritage of the vanished Aryan god ‐ men. In widely ‐ read periodicals, Gorsleben and the Edda occultists teach the traces of the blood of the Aryans are present in the German people. Warning against racial dilution, Gorsleben writes: \"Remember, God dwells within you.\" It is a creed which will become a life ‐ long conviction of Heinrich Himmler, Reichsführer of the SS. As a youth, Himmler had avidly consumed the writings of the German occultists. He'd grown obsessed with astrology, spiritualism, and herbalism. Above all, he had adopted as his own the mystical doctrine of the Aryan. If, as Himmler had come to believe, the blood of the Aryans runs most strongly in the veins of Germanic peoples then, by breeding from the purest individuals, a race of super ‐ humans could be produced, a race in which the Aryan's psychic powers would grow ever stronger. Himmler, trained as an agriculturist and devoted to the occult, is embarking on the strangest eugenics experiment in history. By 1934, a year after the Nazis seize Euro(?) power in Germany, Himmler has firmly established the entry requirements for membership 336"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"of his SS. The SS Race and Resettlement Bureau investigates the racial ancestry of every applicant. Candidates for membership of Himmler's elite must also submit to a rigorous physical examination. Only those of strongly Nordic appearance who are free from bodily defects and of good proportion and stature are accepted. Then begins a year ‐ long process of transformation. Central to the SS man's training is immersion in the cult of the Aryan and the ideology of National Socialism. He must also master the extraordinary set of doctrines enshrined in the SS catechism. It is a catechism in which God is the race. \"Why do we believe in Germany and the Führer? Because we believe in God, we believe in Germany, which He created, and in the Führer Adolf Hitler whom He has sent us. Why do you obey? From inner conviction, from belief in Germany, in the Führer, in the movement, in the SS, and from loyalty.\" On November the 9th, the anniversary of the coup of 1923, the day symbolized by the Rune of Remembrance, the SS candidate swears the 'Kith and Kin' oath. In it, he binds himself and his future family to obey the SS marriage law. None will marry unless the union is approved by the SS Race and Resettlement Bureau. Henceforth, the SS man's family are entitled to wear the coveted badge of SS clan membership, a sunflower bearing the rune of fertility. The strict racial qualifications for SS marriages are widely praised by the scientists and medical men of Germany's racial hygiene movement. Inspired by the example of the SS, measures are already underway to control the breeding of Germany's civilian population. Within months of Hitler's becoming Chancellor of Germany, the first in a series of eugenic laws is passed. The law for the prevention of genetically ‐ diseased offspring establishes a vast network of genetic health courts. These have the power to order that individuals suffering from any of a range of mental or physical ailments be sterilized. The campaign is organized on a massive scale. One thousand seven hundred genetic health courts will, in 1934 alone, order over fifty ‐ six thousand sterilizations. Within ten years, almost four hundred thousand Germans will have been sterilized. In support of the German sterilization campaign, the Reich Health Office in German medical journals published graphic illustrations of the cost to the public of maintaining the mentally and physically handicapped. One poster insists, \"We do not stand alone.\" While a German mother holds her baby, a man holds a shield inscribed with the 1933 sterilization law. Around them are arrayed the flags of nations that have already legalized compulsory sterilization. The second major eugenics law is designed to control the breeding of the population at large. The law for the protection of the genetic health of the German people requires that all those who wish to marry submit to a medical examination. Marriage is totally forbidden to those suffering from diseases believed to be hereditary. The third eugenic measure is passed in the autumn of 1935. Physicians of the racial hygiene movement had long argued that intermarriage between the races is genetically harmful, producing degenerate offspring. The law for the protection of German blood and German honor forbids marriage between Jews and non ‐ Jews. Following this new measure, racial hygienists devise complex formulae for calculating the proportions of Jewish blood which each partner can possess if marriage is to be allowed. The massive task of racially investigating all those wishing to marry is entrusted to the SS Race and Resettlement Bureau. Heinrich Himmler's vision of the SS has from the beginning extended far beyond his eugenic project to breed a race of pure ‐ blooded Aryans. His intention was to create a military ‐ religious order, an order steeped in Aryan mysticism. Himmler has pronounced: \"We assemble and march according to unalterable laws as a National Socialist order of Nordic men, and as a sworn community on our way to a far future.\" In devising rituals and practices for his Nordic order, Himmler has looked for inspiration to the Teutonic tribes of Germany's distant past. On Himmler's instructions, SS archaeologists from the Race and Resettlement Bureau are intensely researching the history of races they believe to be of Aryan descent. To advise him in his search for the religion of the ancient Teutonic tribes, Himmler has recruited into the SS a renowned Germanic occultist, a man whose claim is to be the last in a long line of Aryan priest ‐ kings. Karl Maria Wiligut was born in Vienna in 1866. During the Great War, he'd risen to the rank of colonel in the Austrian army. Wiligut claims to possess ancestral clairvoyant memory, the power to recall the history and experiences of the Germans over thousands of years. He believes that in himself is an unusually pure strain of the normally latent psychic powers of the Aryans. Wiligut's clairvoyant visions have told him that German blood, culture, and history are far more ancient than historians and scientists can know. According to Wiligut, the history of the Aryans had begun in 228,000 B.C., an era in which there were three suns in the sky and the world was populated by giants and other fantastic creatures. Wiligut's own royal line he claims to have originated in union between the gods of the air and water in the very earliest days of the earth. Wiligut claims that amongst his ancestors are many of the greatest of Germanic heroes. All of Wiligut's line through the ages has remained faithful to the occult traditions of the Aryan Germans. Impressed by Wiligut's clairvoyant powers, Himmler accepts Willigut into his SS and appoints him head of the Race and Resettlement Bureau's Department of Prehistory. In a remarkably short time, Wiligut will rise to the rank of SS brigadier on Himmler's personal staff. 337"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"By 1934, Himmler's SS is becoming one of the most powerful organizations in the Reich. Germany's state police forces are one by one falling under Himmler's control. The SS is responsible for all intelligence and security duties in the Nazi party. The SS Race and Resettlement Bureau is dramatically expanding as it polices the national eugenics program. The SS is rapidly becoming a state within the Nazi state. Now Heinrich Himmler, with the help of Karl Wiligut, plans the strangest of all his creations ‐‐ an SS spiritual center, an order castle for his Germanic brotherhood. The castle of Wewelsburg had been built in the early 1600s on the site of a 10th century Saxon fort. Set in the romantic surroundings of Paderborn in Westphalia, Wewelsburg had made a deep impression on Heinrich Himmler. \"We had been looking for a castle for our SS for a long time,\" Himmler confides. \"I have found a suitable ruined castle dating back to Germanic prehistory.\" In late 1934, the SS purchases the sacred site and begins the massive task of reconstruction. Karl Wiligut had accompanied Himmler on his earliest visits to the castle. His researches had revealed an ancient prophecy. \"Here in writing,\" reports Wiligut, \"is the prophecy concerning the great determining battle of which we spoke.\" Wiligut has unearthed a Westphalian legend in which Wewelsburg is destined to become a magical German stronghold in a future conflict between Europe and Asia. The prophecy coincides exactly with Himmler's belief that the SS is to be the bastion of Europe against a massive onslaught from Asia. Already, Himmler's order is preparing for the millennial conflict to come. The SS is to become the most formidable military force in Europe. On December the 14th, 1934, Himmler orders the formation of an SS military detachment, the SS ‐ VT. Almost from the outset, the military training of the SS ‐ VT is revolutionary. The emphasis is less on the barrack square drill favored by the regular army, and on the creation of a new breed of military athlete. In the words of an SS ‐ VT commander: \"Training is designed to produce a subtle and adaptable type of soldier: athletic and bearing, capable of more than ordinary endurance.\" Unlike the regular army, the SS ‐ VT is organized into highly mobile battle groups. It is also the first German military formation to adopt camouflage uniforms, and to the astonishment of army commanders, to maneuver with live ammunition. To the SS, casualties in training are simply to be expected. While the SS ‐ VT is to become an elite force in the service of the Führer and the Aryan mission, another arm of the SS is already at war. The SS [Death's Head] Formation is commanded by Theodor Eicke. It accepts without question the Nazi slogan: National Socialism, the expression of our biological knowledge. The task of the Death's Head is to isolate and, if necessary, destroy those it believes (are) infectious germs in the body of the German people: Jews, homosexuals, political dissidents, and social misfits. The means of quarantine is the concentration camp. As the SS empire spreads its roots deep into the fabric of the Nazi state, Heinrich Himmler, advised by Karl Wiligut, continues to develop and refine the rituals of his order. The officer class envisaged by Himmler, as the priests and high priests of the SS, are to be distinguished by the award of special symbols of their place in the hierarchy. At Himmler's personal discretion, members of the SS core of leaders can be awarded the SS dagger. The dagger is the visible sign of SS nobility and of the favor of the all ‐ powerful Himmler. Irrespective of rank, proven SS men are presented with a silver Death's Head signet ring. The ring is based on a design created for Himmler by Karl Wiligut. Its symbols are of deep mystical significance: the Sig rune ‐‐ emblem of victory; the Hagal rune ‐‐ the rune of hail, destruction, and enclosing. Included is the personal rune group of the Wiligut ancestral tradition, and the swastika, symbol of the destiny of Aryan man. In 1937, Himmler decrees the rings of all dead SS men are to be returned to him for safekeeping in a locked chest deep in the castle of Wewelsburg. The return of the ring is a symbol of the dead man's eternal community with the SS order. The transformation of Himmler's SS castle is, by now, gaining momentum. Under the architect Hermann Bartels, the west and south wings have been fully renovated. The moat and gardens have been restored and a bridge built leading to the imposing main gates.

And Skolnick said, \"Uh, I don't know anything about that.\" (WC laughs) Ah, don't go away sheeple. I just love it. [documentary resumes, narrator continues]: By 1938, the east wing, too, has been completely renovated. True to the deeply secretive nature of the SS, Himmler has banned all but the most trustworthy from visiting Wewelsburg. Bartels has virtually excluded local companies and labor from the project. Instead, contingents of the Pioneer Core have been drafted to the region from all over Germany. In the renovation of the castle interior, Himmler spares no expense. Paneling and furnishings, doors and balustrades are all of solid oak. An elaborately carved spiral staircase is built in workshops on the site. Everywhere there is the finest of decorative wrought iron work. The chambers of SS leaders, each room named after a Germanic hero, are to be filled with appropriate relics. Arms and armor are collected from all over Germany. Himmler has pronounced, \"May the spirit of the most distant past be the future in this castle.\" By the late 1930s, the National Socialist aim of increasing the population of racially desirable Germans has been given the highest national priority. The means is to remove German women from paid employment and return them to the home. Their task will be to produce the greatest possible number of children. Soon after the foundation of the Nazi state, government loans worth a year's salary are rewarded to men whose wives leave their jobs. The amount, which must be repaid, is reduced for every child the family produces. By 1940, 1,700,000 loans will have been granted. In 1938, a decree is issued requiring that all public officials marry or resign. All couples married for five years who are still childless incur a tax penalty. Grounds for divorce are broadened to include the inability of a wife to bear children. Abortion is illegal for those classed as Aryans, but encouraged for non ‐ Aryans. At the instigation of Heinrich Himmler, laws are passed removing all legal obstacles to Aryan women bearing children outside marriage. Himmler has decreed, \"Sacred to us is every mother of good blood.\" Of the greatest value of all are the offspring of his SS elite. In December 1935, Himmler had founded the project which would remain his obsession for almost ten years. He calls it the \"Lebensborn\" ‐‐ the spring of life. It is a chain of maternity homes and breeding centers for his SS racial elite. In Himmler's words, \"A nursery garden for pure Germanic blood.\" In Germany, there will be ten such homes, each veiled in secrecy and under heavy SS guard. \"I fostered rumors,\" Himmler admits, \"to the effect that every single woman desiring a child could turn to Lebensborn in the strictest confidence. We only recommend genuinely valuable men as procreation helpers.\" In spite of the stringent racial qualifications required, there is no shortage of prospective mothers. The Nazi league of German maidens has officially stated, \"Although not every German girl can hope to find a husband, you can all become mothers.\" An SS Race and Resettlement resolution of 1937 notes: \"The Lebensborn will bring them together with a man, not casually, but in full awareness that they are fulfilling a noble duty towards the nation. At a naming ceremony, the children of the Lebensborn project are immediately immersed in the Germanic ritual of the SS clan. Males are touched on the forehead with an SS dagger, symbolizing their first initiation into Himmler's mystical order. Mothers of SS children are told, \"Remember that you are but a link in the clan's endless chain.\" For years, Himmler has pondered the question of how his SS order is to be governed. Taking his inspiration from the Knights of the Round Table, Himmler has appointed a shadowy inner council of twelve chosen SS leaders. The ritual setting for their deliberations is the castle of Wewelsburg. In the massive north tower of the castle is an inner sanctum. A vast circular hall, its walls twelve feet thick. Around the chamber stand twelve columns. On the floor is a mosaic of swastikas forming a sun wheel of twelve radiating spokes. In this strange chamber, Himmler and his chosen twelve commune with the Aryan race soul and the spirits of the Germanic ancestors. Deep below the inner sanctum cut into the solid bedrock is the crypt, Valhalla. Here are performed ceremonies of the dead. In the center, the wooden coats of arms of a dead SS knight are to be ceremonially burned. Twelve stoned plinths around the walls will hold twelve urns, each of which will one day 339"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"hold the armorial ashes of a departed knight. In the crypt burns an eternal flame, symbol of the continuity of the order and its eternal mission in the service of the race. In 1937, Heinrich Himmler, speaking to senior German army officers, proclaims, \"The next ten years will see a war of annihilation conducted by the subhuman enemies of the entire world against Germany, the colonel of the Teutonic race and guardian of the culture of the human race. It will mean,\" warns Himmler, \"the existence or non ‐ existence of that white race of which we are the leading nation.\" In reality, the war of racial annihilation foreseen by Himmler will be the war about to be waged by Germany. For Adolf Hitler, the first step in the creation of a greater Germanic empire has been to order in March 1936 the reoccupation of the demilitarized Rheinland. It is a blatant contravention of the Treaty of Versailles. In the wake of the occupation, the SS becomes deeply involved in the first sterilization campaign to be waged on grounds of race. In a joint operation mounted by the Gestapo and Genetic Health Courts, five hundred children of mixed race, the offspring of black French soldiers, are seized and sterilized. It is a grim warning of horrors to come. By now, the racial doctrines of National Socialism have found ardent support far beyond the frontiers of the German Reich. In the United States of America, the German American Bund, led by Fritz Kuhn, is secretly supported by the German Foreign Office. In Belgium, the ultra ‐ nationalist Rexist party is founded by Leon DeGrelle. In Britain, Oswald Mosley and the British Fascists ardently support Hitler's new Germany. In Austria, Seyss ‐ Inquart, leader of the Austrian National Socialists, is appointed Minister of the Interior in response to German pressure. It is he who, after violence orchestrated by the Austrian SS, invites German forces to enter Austria and restore order. Austria is to become a province of Germany. In the wake of the occupation, SS troops of the Gestapo and SD Security Service arrest seventy ‐ six thousand Austrians and commit them to concentration camps. Next on Hitler's agenda is Czechoslovakia. The leader of the National Socialists in the German populated region of Czechoslovakia is Konrad Henlein. In the months following the German occupation of Austria, Henlein provokes a crisis in the Sudeten. His followers, armed by Germany and supported by detachments of the SS, begin an uprising that will culminate in Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia. As the German army consolidates its hold on Czechoslovakia, Himmler dispatches an SS brigadier to Prague. His mission is to organize the deportation of six million Czechs and the resettlement of Czech agricultural lands by racial Germans. In Himmler's plan, the settlers would be selected on grounds of racial purity by his own Race and Resettlement Bureau. Even though Hitler has already spoken favorably of the mass deportation of Czechs, Himmler's plan comes to nothing. The German armaments industry covets Czech factories and labor, and will tolerate no disruption. In Poland, Himmler's Aryan vision will encounter no such obstacle. In Mein Kampf , Hitler had written, \"We begin where we left off six hundred years ago. We put an end to the perpetual Germanic march to the south and west of Europe, and turn our eyes towards the lands of the east.\" In the summer of 1939, Hitler summons Heinrich Himmler to his Bavarian mountain retreat. In the coming invasion of Poland, the SS is to play a key role. It is to ruthlessly eliminate from the Polish population all those who might carry the seeds of a future class of leaders. Under Himmler's head of security, Reinhard Heydrich, five SS Einsatzgruppen extermination squads are to follow close behind the invading German armies. In Poland, Himmler will embark on the first stage of his long cherished dream. The SS is to be the vanguard of a great Germanic migration. In the invasion of Poland on September the 1st 1939, the SS ‐ VT and Death's Head formations are for the first time thrown into battle. In spite of a lack of experienced leaders, Himmler's hand ‐ picked fighters prove fanatical in the attack, undeterred by heavy casualties. Unlike their army comrades, the SS have been instilled with the knowledge that they are in the service of a great mission ‐‐ a conquest and enslavement of an inferior race and the foundation of an Aryan empire. While the SS military formations bask in the success of their Polish campaign, Reinhard Heydrich's Einsatzgruppen unleash a reign of terror. Tens of thousands of Poles are seized and shot. The victims are teachers, doctors, officials, aristocrats, Catholic priests and Jews. Hitler had ordered, \"Whatever we find in the shape of an upper class in Poland is to be liquidated.\" To the horror of regular army commanders, the SS is reveling in its murderous task. By September the 27th, less than a month after the invasion, Heydrich estimates of the Polish upper classes in the occupied territories, only three percent are still present. For his services in the cause of racial conquest, Heinrich Himmler is rewarded by a grateful Führer. On September the 29th, Hitler informs him that he is to be appointed Reich's Commissioner for the strengthening of Germanism. The resettlement of occupied territories is to be Himmler's exclusive province. The east is to belong to the SS. The war into which Europe has been plunged is eagerly embraced by a rapidly expanding armed SS. By June 1940, Heinrich Himmler's army, now renamed the Waffen ‐ SS, is a formidable motorized force of a hundred thousand men. In the Low Countries in France, the new divisions hunger for glory. While the exploits of his military athletes win the grudging respect of the regular army and, in Hitler's words, 340"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"\"pay the butcher's bill,\" Himmler's thoughts are elsewhere. To him, the war in Western Europe is merely a distraction. Only in the east can the destiny of the SS be truly fulfilled. Since early 1939, an SS plan had been in preparation for the repatriation of up to thirty million racial Germans resident in foreign countries. An agreement had been struck with the Soviet Union and the Baltic states for the transfer of their German populations to the Reich. Their actual destination will be Poland. The SS Race and Resettlement Bureau carefully investigates the ancestry of the first wave of migrants, in all, almost half a million people. They are presented with Reich citizenship and dispatched to SS transit camps. Their fate, according to Himmler's blueprint for the east, is to become a new Germanic peasantry. Their guardians and rulers are to be the aristocracy of the SS. By mid 1941, one million Poles and Polish Jews have been driven from their homes and deported to the area of Poland known as the Government ‐ General. The Jewish people of the conquered territories have been forced into ghettos to await a fate as yet unknown. Two hundred thousand repatriated Germans have been settled on the seized lands. Yet, resettlement is only the first phase in Himmler's grand design. The second is the repossession of whatever Aryan blood can be found in the Polish population. On Himmler's orders, Poles are to be subject to a massive program of racial screening. Tens of thousands of Polish children are examined by the SS Race and Resettlement Bureau. The shape of the face, eye and hair color, even x ‐ rays of the skull, are used by SS physicians to detect traces of Nordic blood. Of those rejected as racially undesirable, many are sterilized. Those deemed of racial value are forcibly taken west. After a period of what the SS term \"regermanization\" in the Lebensborn home, they are to be adopted by SS families. For Himmler, the seizure of children of Aryan stock is a long ‐ term project. Of more pressing importance is the rapid expansion of the Waffen ‐ SS. In Himmler's eyes, traditional ideas of nationality are meaningless. All that matters is race. His aim is the creation of a Pan ‐ European brotherhood of the racially pure, an international SS ready for the coming crusade against the Slavs and Bolshevism. The National Socialist movements of the Nordic countries will prove fertile grounds for recruitment. The Viking Division, composed of Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, and Flemish, is the first of thirteen SS divisions to be raised from Nordic or Germanic foreigners. All are formations entirely composed of volunteers. To the members of Himmler's foreign legions in the racial vision of the SS lies the future of Europe. With the seeds of a Pan ‐ European SS army sewn in the conquered west, and the battles for the east which Himmler foresees drawing ever closer, the castle of Wewelsburg takes on an even more powerful significance. Wewelsburg, spiritual center of the SS order, is to become a city. The north tower, with its sacred hall and underground vault, is to be the center point of vast circular grounds. Surrounding them is to be built an enormous complex of administrative centers, libraries, and research institutes for astrology, astronomy, and Teutonic history. Ringing the city will be walls over forty feet high. Even the ground plan of this, the SS Vatican, is of mystical significance. It represents the head of the spear, its tip pointing to the north. The cost of realizing Himmler's vision is to be three hundred million marks, an extraordinary sum. The entire project is to be completed sometime in the 1960s. By then, the SS will possess its own independent state, a state carved from the heartland of the Soviet Union. To Heinrich Himmler, Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, promises the fulfillment of all his dreams. With victory will come the foundation of an SS kingdom with Heinrich Himmler, Grand Master of the SS order in supreme authority, with SS nobles ruling as the feudal overlords of Germanic settlers, the order will return to its millennial mission. From the SS peasant warrior, conqueror of the Slavs, will be bred over many generations the next phase in human evolution.

Ladies and gentlemen, make sure that you stay glued to your radio tonight as we bring you another in the never ‐ ending series that we call Mystery Babylon. (opening music: unknown orchestral music) Tonight's episode, ladies and gentlemen, is entitled \"Darkness.\" [reading from The Veil of Isis ]: (start of quote) ============================================================== There is no study so [intriguing and yet so mysterious then] that of the early religions of mankind. To trace back the worship of God to its simple origin, and to mark the gradual process of those degrading superstitions, and unhallowed rites which darkened, and finally extinguished His presence in the ancient world. At first men enjoyed the blessings of nature as children do [in an age of innocence], without inquiring into causes. It was[, in fact,] sufficient for them that the earth gave them herbs, that the trees bore them fruit, that the stream quenched their thirst. They were happy, and every moment though unconsciously they offered a prayer of gratitude to Him whom as yet they did not know. And then a system of theology arose amongst them vague and indefinite, as the waters of the boundless sea. They taught each other that the sun, the earth, the moon, and the stars were moved and illumined by a Great Soul which was the source of all life, which caused the birds to sing, the brooks to murmur, and the sea to heave. It was a sacred Fire which shone in the firmament, and in mighty flames. It was a strange Being which animated the souls of men, [and] which when the bodies died, returned to itself again. [Ancient man] silently adored this Great Soul in the beginning, and spoke of Him with reverence, and sometimes [they] raised their eyes timidly to His glittering dwelling ‐ place on high. And soon they learned to pray. When those whom they loved lay dying, they uttered wild lamentations, and flung their arms despairingly towards the mysterious Soul; for in times of trouble the human mind so imbecile, so helpless, [always] clings [back] to something that is [much] stronger than itself. As yet [in that time] they worshiped only the sun, the moon, and the stars ‐‐ and not as [God] but as visions of that Divine Essence, which alone ruled and pervaded the earth, the sky, and the sea. They adored Him kneeling, with their hands clasped, and their eyes raised. They offered Him no sacrifices, they built Him no temples; [you see,] they were content to offer Him their hearts which were full of awe, in His own temple which was full of [the] grandeur [of nature]. [William Cooper: For the God they worshiped was, indeed, nature's God.] And it is said [by some] that there are yet some barbarous islands where men have no churches nor ceremonies, and where they [still] worship God, reflected in the work of His 343"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"[uncountable] hands [William Cooper: in the mystery and the balance and the perfection of nature]. But[, you see,] they were not long content with this simple service. [William Cooper: There were those amongst them who learned how to subvert and twist so that they could control the others around them.] Prayer which had first been an inspiration fell into a system, and men already grown wicked prayed the Deity to give them abundance [with] wild beast's skins, and to destroy their enemies. They ascended eminences, [mountaintops, and they built towers] as if hoping that thus [they're] being nearer God, He would prefer their prayers to those of their rivals. [And those who control those eminences became powerful. And] such is the origin of that superstitious reverence for high places which was universal throughout the whole [entire] heathen world. [William Cooper: And then, it is clear in the ancient annals, someone came forth.] ...Orpheus was born. And he invented instruments which to his touch and to his lips, gave forth notes of surpassing sweetness, and with these melodies he enticed the wondering [innocent] savages into the recesses of the forest, and there[, there Orpheus] taught them precepts of obedience to the great Soul, and of loving ‐ kindness towards each other in harmonious words[, and he became the high priest]. [And] so they devoted groves and forests to the worship of the Deity. There were men who had watched Orpheus, and who had seen and envied his power over the herd who surrounded him[, for even then there were sheeple]. They resolved to imitate him, and having studied these barbarians, they banded together, and called themselves their priests. Religion ‐‐ is divine, but its ministers[, after all,] are men. [William Cooper: And the idea, from the beginning, that imperfect men can rule imperfect men is flawed.] [For] alas! sometimes they are demons with the faces and wings of angels. [You see, ] the simplicity of men, and the cunning of their priests has destroyed or corrupted all the religions of the world[, bar none]. [For] these priests[, ladies and gentlemen,] taught the people to sacrifice the choicest herbs and flowers. They taught them formulas of prayer, and bade them make so many obeisances to the sun, and to worship those flowers which opened their leaves when he rose, and which closed them as he set. [William Cooper: For the great ball of fire that makes its way from dawn to dusk across the sky was seen as the savior to those who huddled in the cold darkness, surrounded by wild beasts of prey, and it was to that sun that they directed their worship. And the great symbol in the heaven of the power of God and the source of life on this earth. [sic] For remember, theirs were the worship of nature's God.] They composed a language of symbols which was perhaps necessary, [and as time] since letters had not been invented, but which perplexed the people and perverted them from the worship of the one God. [William Cooper: Those symbols are still used upon the sheeple of the world today...the great herd.] [Thus, the sun represented the great doctrine of this religion and the moon represented the church, reflecting the pure light of the sun. And] the sun and moon were worshiped as emblems of God, and fire[, by the philosophers of fire,] as an emblem of the sun, water as an emblem of the moon [which, by faith, reflected the pure light of its master]. The serpent [represented the full body of the priesthood, the initiates,] was to be worshiped..as an emblem of wisdom and eternal youth, since it renews its skin every year, and thus [and] periodically casts off all symptoms of old age [and begins anew ‐‐ reborn, if you will]. And the bull, [the] most vigorous of animals, and whose horns resemble those of the crescent moon [was also worshiped]. The priests observed the avidity with which the barbarians adored these symbols, and increased them. 344"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: It was a time of great mystery and little understanding of any that was seen around them. To ancient man, the sun was seen to die and darkness descended around them, to the time of great danger and cold. And then, as if by magic, the sun was reborn each morning and made its way across the sky, were it became old and then died again. And they began to measure their world by the seasons of the sun, and their religion reflected all of this. And religions today, even though denying any connection with this ancient paganism, still reflects this exact religion in ceremonies and its holy days...even to the layout of its churches.] To worship the visible is a disease of the soul inherent to all mankind, and the disease which these men could have healed [instead] they pandered to. It is true that the first generation of men might have looked upon these merely as the empty symbols of a Divine Being, but it is also certain that in time the vulgar forgot the God in the emblem, and worshiped that which their fathers had only honored [and, therefore, the symbol became the god]. Egypt was the fountain ‐ head of these idolatries, and it was in Egypt that the priests first applied real attributes to the sun, and to the moon whom they called his wife[, and sister, and mother. And the sun became Osiris, the moon became Isis, brother and sister, mother and son, husband and wife]. It may[, it may] perhaps[, for those of you who have not heard it, and maybe have not been listening to this broadcast for a great period of time...it may perhaps] interest you to listen to the first[, very first,] fable of the world. From the midst of chaos was born [Nimrod (*note, the text reads Osiris)], and at his birth a voice was heard proclaiming ‐‐ \"The ruler of all the earth is born.\" [And] from the same dark and troubled womb were born [Semiramis (*note: the text reads, \"Isis\")] the Queen of Light, and...(*note: the text reads, \"Typhon\") the Spirit of Darkness. This [Nimrod] traveled over the whole world, and civilized its inhabitants, and taught them the art of agriculture. [And his wife, Semiramis, built the first fortified cities and walls.] But on his return...the jealous [darkness (*note: text reads, \"Typhon\")] laid a stratagem for him, and in the midst of a banquet had him [slain (*note: text reads, \"shut up in a chest which exactly fitted his body\"]. He was nailed down in his prison, which cast into the [river (*note, text reads, \"Nile\")] floated down to the sea...which even in [that ancient] time...was never mentioned...but with marks of detestation. [And] when [Semiramis] learnt these sad news she cut off a lock of her hair, and put on her mourning robes, and wandered through the whole country in search of the...dead body of her husband. [William Cooper: Eventually, she found it. By casting a magic spell, a magical intercourse was obtained between Semiramis and the dead Nimrod from which a child emerged. The child was Tammuz. And Semiramis fed the infant with her finger instead of with her breast and put in every night into fire to render him immortal. And now, let me read you a later story of the same myth, only with different names. And [I have to depart] from my narration here and read this to you:] [repeats text using the original names]: From the midst of chaos was born Osiris, and at his birth a voice was heard proclaiming ‐‐ \"The ruler of all the earth is born.\" [And] from the same dark and troubled womb were born Isis the Queen of Light, and Typhon the Spirit of Darkness. This Osiris [moved] over the whole world, and civilized its inhabitants, and taught them the art of agriculture[, brought them together in societies for the mutual benefit and protection]. But on his return to Egypt the jealous Typhon laid a stratagem for him, and in the midst of a banquet had him shut up in a chest which exactly fitted his body. He was nailed down in his prison, which cast into the Nile floated down to the sea by the Taitic mouth, which even in the time of Plutarch was never mentioned by an Egyptian [expect with disdain and loathing]. When Isis [heard the news] she cut off a lock of her hair, and put on her mourning robes, and wandered through the whole country in search of the chest which contained the dead body of her husband. At length she learnt that the chest had been carried by the waves to the shore of Byblos, and had there lodged in the branches of a tamarisk bush, which quickly shot up and became a large and beautiful tree, growing round the chest so that it could not be seen. The king of the country amazed at the vast size the tree had so speedily acquired, ordered it to be cut down to be hewn into a pillar to support the roof of his palace ‐‐ the chest being still concealed in the trunk. The voice which had spoken from Heaven at the birth of Osiris made known these things to poor Isis, who [then] went to the shore of 345"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Byblos and sat down silently by a fountain to weep. The damsels of the queen met her and accosted her, and the queen appointed her to be nurse to her child. And Isis fed the infant with her finger instead of with her breast, and put him every night into fire to render him immortal, while transforming herself into a swallow she hovered round the pillar which was her husband's tomb, and bemoaned her unhappy fate. It happened that the queen thus discovered her, and shrieked when she saw her child surrounded by flames. By that cry she broke the charm and deprived him of immortality. By that cry Isis was summoned back to her goddess ‐ form, and stood before the awe ‐ struck queen shining with light and diffusing sweet fragrances around. She cut open the pillar, and took the coffin with her, and opened it in a desert. [And] there she embraced the cold corpse of Osiris, and wept bitterly. (break music: dark, dramatic instrumental) [continues reading]: [Isis] returned to Egypt and hid the coffin in a remote place: but Typhon, hunting by moonlight, chanced to find it, and divided the corpse into fourteen pieces. Again Isis set out on her weary search throughout the whole land, sailing over the fenny parts in a boat made of papyrus. She recovered all the fragments except one which had been thrown into the sea. Each of these she buried in the place where she found it, which explains why in Egypt there are so many tombs of Osiris. And instead of the limb which was lost, she gave the phallus to the Egyptians ‐‐ the disgusting worship of which was thence carried into Italy, into Greece, and into all the countries of the East. [William Cooper: And today, people pay obeisance to this phallus when they stand in awe of the Washington Monument, or when they attend SPIKE training. For truly (laughs)...for truly, it is the shaft.] When Isis died, she was buried in a grove near Memphis. Over her grave was raised a statue covered from head to foot with a black veil. And underneath was engraved these divine words: \"I am all that has been, that is, that shall be, and none among mortals has yet dared to raise my veil.\" Beneath this veil[, ladies and gentlemen,] are concealed all the mysteries and learning of the past. A young scholar, his fingers covered with the dust of venerable folios, his eyes weary and reddened by nightly toil will now attempt to lift a corner of this mysterious and sacred covering. [William Cooper: The folios are the old books that I have discovered in the used bookstores across the country and around the world. And truly, in some of those dark and dim corners and shelves which have never been touched, I have literally been covered with the dust of years that have settled upon these ancient volumes. Those I could afford found their way into my library, where they still serve today.] [You see,] these two Deities, Isis and Osiris were the parents of all the Gods and Goddesses of the Heathens, or were indeed those Gods themselves worshiped under [many] different names[: Nimrod, Semiramis, Isis, Osiris, Diana, Dionysus]. The fable itself was received into the mythologies of the Hindus and the Romans. Sira is said to have mutilated Brahma as Typhon did Osiris, and Venus to have lamented her slain Adonis, as Isis wept for her husband ‐ god[, brother, son]. [And] as yet the sun and moon alone were worshiped under these two names. And as we have seen, besides these twin beneficial spirits, men who had begun to recognize sin in their hearts had created an Evil One who struggled with the power of light, and fought with them for the souls of men. [I must tell you that in my studies I find that it has been natural, through all history,] for man to fabricate something that is worse than himself[, rather than take the responsibility upon his own shoulders]. [And] even in the theology of the American Indians which is the purest of the modern world, there is found a Mahitou or dark Spirit. Osiris or the sun was now worshiped throughout the whole world, though under different names. He was the Mithra of the Persians, the Brahma of India, the Baal or Adonis of the Phoenicians[; he was] the Apollo of the Greeks, the Odin Of Scandinavia, the Hu of the 346"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Britons, and the Baiwe of the Laplanders. Isis[, ladies and gentlemen,] also received the [name] of Islene, Ceres, Rhea, Venus, Vesta, Cybele, Niobe, Melissa ‐‐ Nehalennia in the North; Isi with the Indians; Puzza among the Chinese; and Ceridwen among the ancient Britons. [In] the Egyptians were sublime philosophers who had dictated theology to the world. And in Chaldea arose the first astrologers who watched the heavenly bodies with curiosity as well as with awe, and who made divine discoveries, and who called themselves The Interpreters of God. [And] to each star they gave a name, and to each day in the year they gave a star. And the Greeks and Romans who were poets, wreathed these names into legends. Each name was a person, [and] each person was a god. From these stories of the stars originated the angels of the Jews, the genii of the Arabs, the heroes of the Greeks, and the saints of the Romish Church. [And then] corruption grew upon corruption, and superstition flung...black and hideous veil over the doctrines of religion. [You see,] a religion[, ladies and gentlemen,] is lost [ ‐‐ utterly lost ‐‐ ] as soon as it loses its simplicity: truth has no mysteries: it is deceit alone that lurks in obscurity. [William Cooper: It is only the lie that is hidden behind a door!] Men multiplied God into a thousand names, and created Him always in their own image. Him, too, whom they had once deemed unworthy of any temple less noble than the floor of the earth and the vast dome of the sky [which He had created], they worshiped in caves, and then in temples which were made of the trunks of trees rudely sculptured, and ranged in rows to imitate groves [of trees], and with other trunks placed upon them transversely [William Cooper: to form the cross that is seen when you hold up your son behind some obstacle. [sic] They streak across the sky.] [These] were the first buildings of worship erected by man from no reverence for the Deity, [or God,] but [only] to display that which they...conceived to be a stupendous effort in art [William Cooper: and to display their knowledge and power, so as to more adequately rule and subjugate the herd, the sheeple, the profane, humanity, that had not a clue ‐‐ and still doesn't, by the way.] It may...be [necessary] to remind some of [you] that a superior being [ ‐‐ God, if you will ‐‐ must view the elegant temples of the Romans, the gorgeous pagodas of India, and [the] Gothic cathedrals [of the Western world] with feelings similar to those with which we [might] contemplate the rude efforts of the early heathens [or a hill of ants], who deemed God unworthy of the fruits and flowers which he himself had made, and offered to him the entrails of beasts, and the hearts of human beings. [William Cooper: Can you imagine the audacity, the arrogance of such a thing?] We [can] compare[, ladies and gentlemen,] an ancient and fallen religion to the ship of the Argonauts, which the Greeks desiring to preserve to posterity, repairing in so many different ways, that at length there did not remain a fragment of [the original] vessel which had born to Colchis the conqueror of the Golden Fleece. [So let's] pass over a lapse of [many, many] years [ ‐‐ centuries, if you will ‐‐ ] and then contemplate the condition of [the] nations in whom religion had been first born. We find the Egyptians adoring the most common of plants, the most contemptible of beasts, the most hideous of reptiles. The solemnity and pomp of their absurd ceremonies held them up to the ridicule of the whole world. Clemens of Alexandria describes one of their temples[, thusly quote]: \"The walls shine with gold and silver, and with amber, and sparkle with the gems of India and Ethiopia: and the recesses are concealed by splendid curtains. But if you enter the penetralia, and inquire for the image of God for whose sake the fane was built; one of the Pastophori, or some other attendant on the temple approaches with a solemn and mysterious face, and putting aside the veil suffers you to obtain a glimpse of the divinity. [And] there[, upon an altar,] you behold a snake, [or] a crocodile, or a cat, or some other beast, a fitter inhabitant of a cavern, or a bog than of a temple.\" [William Cooper: Or a giant penis, the phallus of Osiris, which Isis had substituted upon the altar of Egypt.] The priests of Egypt [were] always impostors, but once so celebrated, had...degenerated into a race of jugglers [or circus, if you will]. Also the Chaldœans lived upon the fame of their fathers, and upon their own base trickeries. 347"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"[William Cooper: No one was honest anymore. No one could point to God. No one understood that all the symbols of the universe and in nature represented the power of an unseen God that the first men worshiped.] The Brachmans or Brahmins, [whose] priests of India, once so virtuous and [celebrated as being] so wise...they too had fallen. Once they had forbidden the shedding of so much as an insect's blood: one day in the year alone, at the feast of Jagam, they were authorized to sacrifice the flesh of a beast, and from this many had refrained from attending, unable to conquer their feelings of abhorrence. But now they had learnt from the fierce Scythians and from the Phoenicians who traded on their coasts to sacrifice the wife upon her husband’s pyre ‐‐ to appease the gentle Brahmah with the blood of men. [William Cooper: And that ceremony continues to this day.] Now the angels who had presided over them became savage demons, who scourged them on to cruel penances, [even] to life ‐ times of suffering and famine. [And] in the sacred groves where once the Brachman Fathers had taught their precepts of love, men emaciated, careworn, [even] dying, wandered sadly, waiting for death as tortured prisoners wait for their liberty. But worse still, these wicked priests sought through the land for the most beautiful young women, and trained them to dance in the temples, and to entice the devotees to their arms with lustful attitudes and languishing looks, and with their voices which mingled harmoniously with the golden bells suspended on their feet. [William Cooper: They became prostitutes for the priesthood.] They sang hymns to the gods in public, and in private enriched the treasuries of the pagoda with their infamous earnings. [And] thus a pure and simple religion was debased by the avarice and lewdness of its priests: till the temples became a den of thieves: till prostitution sat enthroned upon the altars of the Gods. [William Cooper: And today it continues, although prostitution in a different way. Most religious meetings today are spiritual consumerism. It begins with a problem, and when the hour is over the problem has been solved, and the coffers of the priests, the minister, have been filled in the process.] Greece and Rome buried in sloth and luxury did not escape the general contamination. The emblem of generation [ ‐‐ the phallus ‐‐ ] which Isis had bestowed upon the Egyptians, and which they had held in abstract reverence, had now obtained a prominent place in the festivals of these nations as did the Lingam [and] those of the Hindus [And] it was openly paraded in processions [ ‐‐ before guests in the home ‐‐ in processions] in the streets: it was worn by Roman nations in bracelets upon their arms. [William Cooper: It adorned our nation's capital as the Washington Monument and stands, mocking us, in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas.] The sacred festivals and mysteries which they had received from the Egyptians, and for which the women had been wont to prepare themselves by continence, and the men by fasting, were now mere vehicles for [all the] depravities [and deceptions] of the [very] lowest kind. Men were permitted to join the women in their worship of Bacchus, [or] Adonis, of the Bona Dea, and even of Priapus, and so dissolute did the Dionusia become, [ladies and gentlemen,] that the civil powers were compelled[, ye, forced,] to interfere with those of religion, and the Bacchanalia were abolished by a decree of the Roman senate. [William Cooper: But it was too late, for Rome's fate had been sealed.] And the Jews, the chosen people of God, had not their religion changed? Had not God, weary with their sins, yielded them to captivity, scourged them with sorrow, menaced them with curses? [William Cooper: And isn't the state of Israel more a secular state than a religious state today, despite the claims of Zionism?] They worshiped Baal ‐ Peor, the Priapus of Assyria, they sacrificed their children to Moloch: they had dancing ‐ girls in the holy temple. [William Cooper: And this corruption spared no race, no people, no religion, and no one can point to any other and say, truthfully, that they're more guilty than they. For all are guilty ‐‐ all people, all religions, all nations all over this world have destroyed the simple precepts of all the different religions of the world, and none resemble even slightly what they began to be.] [And I'm] not [going to] go deeper into particulars [that are] so degrading to human nature. [William Cooper: I can see you squirming in your seats as it is, so I will have mercy.] I will[, instead,] invite you to follow me [by steadily listening to the Hour of the Time into] a corner...where [you may begin to more readily understand where we are at, and where we are going, for there are many who have 348"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"traveled this route before in the history of the world. It is enacted in cycles, and those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. There is a place in the world where], at least for many ages religion was preserved in its pristine purity, and whose priests, through a barbarous soldiery, were received as martyrs [they claim] in heaven before they had [even] learned to be knaves upon [this] earth. It was an isolated spot unknown to the world in the earlier ages of vice. It is now a kingdom renowned for its [once great] power [that encircled the grove] and for its luxuries from hemisphere to hemisphere[, and for its civilizing influence and also its abject cruelty]. It was encircled by the blue waters of the German and Atlantic Seas, and abounded in the choicest gifts of nature. It was called The White Island from those cliffs which still frown so coldly upon Gaul, and The Land of Green Hills from its verdant mountains.
