It was part of my job to verify whether this man did indeed speak the truth or was just another person se eking fame and fortune. What I found was a rugged, bulldog, driven individual who was kind, thoughtful and tenderhearted. He was truly con cerned about you and your welfare. Bill knew that people were badly info rmed by a society which spoon-feeds you deception until there is no distincti on between fiction and reality. He sees what many other[s] see happening, and he is not afraid to do something about it. There are many who do not want you to know what Bill has to say. They have tried many times to stop him from saying it. The scars on his face and the loss of his leg are his badges of sincerity on your behalf. No one becomes popular by telling people the truth. History records what happened to the true prophets of the past. However, some have listened to their warnings and were not caught off-guard. Others have put their heads in the sand and refused to listen. Bill has it together, and has put it together for you so you can also be one of the informed of the world. A well informed person can make the right decision. William Cooper has my vote of approval because I cared enough to find out who the man is. Now is your opportunity."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE There have been many related sequ ential coincidences all throughout my life, incidents that by themselves would have led now here. Statistical- ly, the odds against the same or a re lated sequence of events happening to one individual are astronomically high. It is this series of incidents that have convinced me that Go d has had a hand in my life. I do not believe in fate. I do not believe in accidents. I cannot and will not accept the theory that long sequences of unre- lated accidents determine wo rld events. It is inconceivable that those with power and wealth would not band t ogether with a common bond, a com- mon interest, and a long-range plan to decide and direct the future of the world. For those with the resources, to do otherwise would be totally irresponsible. I know that I would be th e first to organize a conspiracy to control the outcome of the future, if I were such a person and a conspiracy did not yet exist. I would do it in an a ttempt to ensure the survival of the principles in which I believe, the surv ival of my family , my survival, and the survival of the human race, if for no other reason. I believe, therefore, that a grand game of chess is being played on a level that we can barely imagine, and we are the pawns. Pawns are valu- able only under certain ci rcumstances and are frequen tly sacrificed to gain an advantage. Anyone who has studied military strategy is familiar with the concept of sacrifice. Those who have seriously studied history have probably discovered the real reason we go to war on a regularly scheduled basis. Before reading this book I advise you to play at least two complete games of chess. You must learn the rules THEY play by. You must realize objectively that some pieces are more valuable than others and that the king is the most valuable of all. You cannot learn reality if you get caught up in the fantasy that \"if s not fair .\" You must come to know that the ultimate outcome of the game is the only thing that counts. You were lied to when you were told th at \"it does not matter whet her you win or lose, if s how you play the game.\" Winning in the world of the elite is everything. Indeed, it is the only thing. Th e power elite intend to win. My research has shown, at this point, that the future laid out for us may be just about impossible to chan ge. I do not agree with the means by which the powerful few have chosen for us to reach the end. I do not agree that the end is where we should end at all. But unless we can wake the people from their sleep, nothing short of civil war will stop the planned outcome. I base that statement not on defeatism but on the apathy of the majority of the American people. Twenty-five years ago I would have believed otherwise — but twenty-five years ago I was al so sound asleep. We have been taught lies. Reality is not at all what we perceive it to be."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"William Cooper • 3 We cannot survive any longer by hanging onto the falsehoods of the past. Reality must be discerned at all costs if we are to be a part of the future. Truth must prevail in all instances, no ma tter who it hurts or helps, if we are to continue to live upon this earth. At this point , what we want may no longer matter. It is what we must do to ensure our surv ival that counts. The old way is in the certain process of destruction and a New World Order is beating down the door. To cling to the past is guaranteed suicide. To remain apathetic is assured enslavement. To learn the tr uth and then act upon it is the only means of survival at this moment. To shrug off the information contained in this book and to disr egard its warning will result in the complete destruction of the Republic of the Unite d States of America. You will never get a second warning or a second chance. Like it or not, this is it, stark reality. You can no longer turn your head, ignore it, pretend if s not true, say \"it can't happen to me,\" run, or hide. The wolf is at the door. I fear for the little ones, the innocents, who are already payi ng for our mistakes. There exists a great army of occupationally orphaned children. They are attending government-controlle d day-care centers. And latch- key kids who are running wild in the streets. And the lop-sided, emotion- ally wounded children of single welfar e mothers, born only for the sake of more money in the monthly check. Open your eyes and look at them, for they are the future. In them I see the sure and certain de struction of this once-proud nation. In their vacant eyes I see the death of Freedom. They carry with them a great emptiness — and someone will surely pay a great price for their suffering. If we do not act in concert with each other and ensure that the future becomes what we need it to be, then we will surely deserve whatever fate awaits us. I believe with all my heart that God put me in places and in positions throughout my life so that I would be able to deliver this warning to His people. I pray that I have been worthy and that I have done my job. THIS IS MY CREED I believe first in God, the same God in which my ance stors believed. I believe in Jesus Christ and that he is my saviour. Second, I believe in the Constitution of the Republic of the United States of America, without interpretation, as it was written and meant to work. I have given my sacred oath \"to protect a nd defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemie s foreign and domestic.\" I intend to fulfill that oath.

It is hard to understand why some people thirst for knowledge about me. It was never my intention to be anyone's hero. I am certainly no great example upon which to base one's life . I consider myself a very average normal kind of guy. I have some pr etty good points; I have some human failings. I am proud of so me of my achievements, an d there are things that I wish I had not done. I'm not perfect, and I am not su re that I ever want to be. But it is certain that I do not be long on anyone's pedestal. I am a man with a message. And the message will be accepted by only a few. To those few who will understand, I am your brother. Maybe...we can change the future for the better. William Moore, in his disinformation publicat ion entitled \"Focus,\" said that I am a fundamentalist prea cher. Twenty years ago that would have been a compliment, but today it implies sleaziness. That is why he said it. I am not, and have never been any kind of preacher. I am not starting a church. I am not developing a religion. I do not belong to any organizations. I do not have an entour age. There is no cult and I am not a cult leader. No one camps out around my house. People have called radio talk shows claiming to have first-hand knowledge that I am a noto rious radical right-wing extremist. Others have said they have proof that I belong to a white racist organization. Someone said that they found my name on a list of communist party members. A man in Los Angeles, always the same voice, calls when I am on radio claiming that I am an alc oholic. The truth is, most of my close friends and acquaintances consider themselves to be liberal democrats. My only politi- cal stance is Constitutional. My wife is Chinese. Th at rules out the racist propaganda. I fought the communists in Vietnam. I will fight them again, if necessary, but only on Un ited States soil. I used to drink a lot of alcohol in my younger days. As I became olde r the booze dwindled to a trickle. Now I do not drink much at all. Most of my friends have never seen me take a drink. Annie and I are fond of using wine in our cooking. The lies, no doubt, will continue. For the purpose of keeping everything in perspective, let's all under- stand that attempts to assassinate my character will continue and in all probability will become worse. Rather than let that get in the way, I want you to believe everything bad that you ever hear about me. See if that changes anything that I have been trying to tell you. See if it negates any of the proof. I believe that is the easiest wa y to handle those attacks. You who are sincerely interested in kn owing will seek out me or those who are intimate- ly close to me. Those who do are the only ones who will ever really know who and what I am."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"William Cooper • 7 My ancestors came from England, Scotland, and Ireland. I had rela- tives who fought on both sides in the Civil War. And some who fought in the Indian Wars. One of my ancestors was a horse thief in Texas. I don't know for sure, but I think he got hung for it. When I was a little boy I heard whispers that there was some Cherok ee blood in the family. Every time I asked about it I was told to shut up. I never could figu re out why everyone was afraid to talk about the Indian bl ood. I thought, and still think, that it is something of which to be proud. I have since discovered that the old folks in my family, like the old folks in almost every fa mily, thought there was some stigma attached to being part Indian. In the old days on the American frontier, people lived by ha rd rules. If you weren't accepted by your neighbors you were more th an likely to end up dead. My paternal grandmother' s family, named Vance, traveled to Texas in a covered wagon and were some of the first settle rs in the area of Odessa. My great grandfather Vance was a r eal cowboy who eventually became one of the first oil-field workers. My grea t grandmother Vance told me that one of their first homes was a dugout on th e prairie. My great aunt Sister owned a photo of her father , my great grandfather Va nce, standing in front of a saloon beside his friend. Both men had six-guns stuck in their belts. When she was about 84 or so she to ld me that my great grandfather Vance had gone off to do some work for a rancher. It was during a particularly nasty Indi an uprising. My great grandmother was a newly married young woman at the time. She rose early one morning and saw smoke rising from the direction of one of her neighbors. Soon a war party of five young braves rode up to he r dugout. She told me that she was scared to death but knew if she showed it they w ould kill her for sure. The Indians were hungry. Grea t Grandma Vance made th em get down off their ponies, dragged them inside and fed them. They didn't harm her. After filling their stomachs they rode off in the direction wh ere she saw smoke rising later that afternoon. She said th at she learned later that she was the only one in the area that had not been burned out or killed. She was a very brave woman. Great Grandma Vance died in a car accident just a short time after telling me that story. I th ought it was a very strange way for her to die. She went from covered wagons to Fords and Boeing 707s. Grandma Vance saw just about everything that ever was im portant in this world happen in her lifetime. My paternal grandfather's family also rode across the country in a covered wagon. They strayed a little north, however, and ended up in the Indian territory now known as Oklaho ma.

A little town sprang up not too far away called Garb er. They raised a lot of kids. I remember my great grandmother cookin g the biggest brea kfast I had ever seen. We slept in real feather beds that swallowed us up. We ran to the outhouse in the middle of the night because we were embarrassed to use the chamber pot that Great Grandma ke pt handy under every bed. In the morning everyone would crowd around the wood stove in the kitchen or the coal stove in the pa rlor trying to get warm. My dad had given me a .22 rifle for Christma s and Great Grandma's farm was the first place that I ever went hunting. I got up before the sun one morning, tiptoed downstairs, and headed out for the creek. About two hours later I saw my chance and shot a quail sitting up in a tree. I strutted proudly to the farmhouse hol ding that quail up for all to see. Luckily the farmhand saw me first. He burst out laughing and asked me what I thought I was doing with that sparrow. I ran off and buried that bird and never said a word to anyone. I learned later that quails don't sit in trees. For those who may think this to be a terrible thing, I must tell you that every boy in those days was given a rifle and taught to hunt. During hunting season many a family managed to put aside some extra money because the boys brought home meat from the hunt. That money saved was sorely needed. It was considered a duty for a citizen to own a gun in order to carry out the intent of the 2nd amendment to the Constitution. As long as the citizens owned guns the government could never become oppressive. My mother's family ca me from Scotland and settled in North Caro- lina. They were hardwork ing and thrifty folk. Most of them were poor. I never knew much more about my mother 's family. I don't even remember anyone talking much about them. I know that my grandmother, Nellie Woodside, was forced to give up so me of her children when her husband died. There was not enough money to feed all of the kids. My mother was one of those chosen to li ve in a children's home un til things got better. No one ever talked about my mother's father. When I asked about my grand- father I was told, \"Red was no good, and you just mind your own busi- ness.\" I got the feel ing that nobody liked him. He died before I entered this world. I was born May 6, 1943. I was reared in a military family. My father is USAF Lt. Col. (Ret.) Milton V. Cooper . He prefers to be called Jack, the nickname given to him by the family when he was a boy.

I can remember the pilots gathered around the kitchen table talking about the planes and telling stories. Sometimes they discussed strange things called foo fighters or UFOs. When we were lucky they got out the projector and showed Kodachrome slid es. That was a special treat. By the time I was eight years old, I think I had already seen and been inside every plane the Air Force (which used to be the Army Air Force) had ever owned. I had flown in several. I had seen many of them crash and had friends who had lost their fathers. I remember one night in the Azores at Lages Field. We were at the base theater watching a movie when the projector ground to a stop, the lights came on and a plea was made for blood donors. We knew there had been a disaster. Everyone went outsi de and looked down the hill at the flightline. It was literally consumed in flames. We could see men on fire running through the night. A B-29 had crashed. I forget if it had been taking off or landing; but I will neve r forget the scene that was spread before me on that night. No one went back to the movie even though we had only seen half. I was nine years old but felt much older. I had seen many crashes, and I would see many more in the years to come. But I never saw anything that could ever compare to the wreckage, the fire, the devas- tation, or the loss of life caused by the crash of that B-29. We left the Azores a year later. As we climbed into the sky I looked out the plane window. I could still see pieces of the wreckage where it had been pushed away from the runways. It was that incident th at gave me an appreciation of the dangers that my dad faced on a daily basis. I knew then how lucky we were to see him walk in the door. Aviation wasn't safe in those days, especially for military pilots. We all knew families that had lost someone in a crash. I didn't always love my father. He was a strict disciplinarian. My dad did not believe in \"spare the rod\" and his belt was put to use frequently in our family. I was a very sensitive but willful child. Rules didn't mean much to me until I got caught breaking them. Many times I was the focus of his anger. Like most kids, I di dn't understand. I thought he was a tyrant. Now I appreciate his upbringing. I know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that without his strict discipline we most probably would have turned out bad. Now I love my Dad. He is my friend. He is an independent, gre- garious, feisty, tough, confident, a dventurous, sometimes overbearing, handsome, big bear of a man.

She is one of the last of a dying breed. Dovie Nell (Wood- side) Cooper is the type of woman that men like to dream about when they're lonely. She is the kindest, gentlest, woman that I have ever known. I do not make that statement just because she is my mother. It's true. She was beautiful as a young woman and she is beautiful now. My mother is one of those people who, once she likes you, can't be driven away. She is loyal to a fault. I have seen her during the good and during the bad times. She never flinched, no matter what. It always surprised me that she could be so tough and yet so kind, gentle, and loving all at the same time. Woe to anyone who ever harms my dad or one of her children in her presence. She is the best cook who ever stepped foot in any kitchen that was ever built. I love my mother probably more than anyone else in this world. I have a brother Ronnie and a sister Connie. They are fraternal twins two years younger than me. We were closer than most siblings when we were children because we spent so much of our life in foreign countries, where oftentimes we found ourselves unable to communicate except with each other. We had school friends, but school was often many miles from where we lived. We had few toys. Most of them were things that mother gave us such as spools, cigar boxes, string, or anything else that we could find to keep us occupied. Every Christmas was a delight because we always got some REAL toys. Ronni e and I had a propensity to see how things worked, however, so they neve r lasted long. Everything we wore, including shoes, was ordered from the Sears catalog. It was the wish book, and we never tired of looking through it. We alternately loved each other, hated each other, fought each other, and defended each other, as I guess all kids do. Ronnie, his wife Suzie, and their daughter Jennifer live in Garber, Oklahoma, where Ron sells John Deere farm equipment. Ron & Suzie built t h e i r house with their own hands. As far as I know they intend to live in that house until they die. Ronnie served as an officer in the Army. In Vietnam he earned the Silver Star.

Almost every pict ure I've seen shows Ron in chaps, a Stetson, boots, and either near or on a horse.

When she was little I sometimes liked her and sometimes di dn't. Little boys don't usually have much use for little girls. Since we only had each other to play with, however, Ronnie and I loved her a lot; but little boys just can't ever admit anything like that. I remember Connie always followed me everywhere I went. I couldn't get rid of her no ma tter how hard I tried. Her devotion and loyalty made me love her all the more. Of course I pretended that she was a pain in the ass. As we grew older and began to realize that there was a really big difference between boys and girls Connie began to take on an air of mystery. From that time until I was about 18 she baffled me com- pletely. I remember when she was around 13 or so she would throw temper tantrums when she got angry. She would stomp her feet, scream, run to her room and then slam the door. Ronnie and I thought it was a great show but couldn't for love or money understand why she did it.

They had two beautiful children, Janice and Chrissie. Janice is very much like Connie, loving and loyal. Chrissie is different. She's a redhead who loves to party. I guess Chrissie represents a freedom of spir it more than anything else. Connie's marriage deteriorated and no one could figure out what was happening until Gus was diagnosed as ha ving brain tumors . It was tragic. Everyone really loved Gus. As his di sease progressed and he began to do crazy things, people just drifted aw ay. I have always nurtured a very special love for Chrissie. She never de serted her father. When no one else could stand to be around him, Chriss ie chose to go and live with him \"so he won't be lonely ,\" she said. Even now I get all choked up when I think of that little red-headed girl going to live with her sick father \"so he won't be lonely.\" His behavior was such that no one else could stand to be around him. At least that is what I'm told. It wasn't Gus' s fault that he became ill and I've always felt it just wasn't fair to Connie, the children, or Gus. I've since learned that life is seldom fair. Connie eventually remarried and mo ved to Austin, Texas, where she has established herself as a valuable employee of a large bank. Her hus- band is an executive for McGraw Hill.

In those days we were the elite of the Air Force and we knew it. I received a Letter of Commendation for my work. In due time I was awarded the National Defense Medal and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal. (Actually, I think everyone was awarded the National Defense Medal so that no one would be emba rrassed standing in formation with nothing on their chest.) It was during this time that I met a couple of sergeants who kind of adopted me. We went out to the cl ubs together and usually ended up chasing women and drinking a lot of beer. They told me several stories about being attached to a special unit that recovered crashed flying saucers. Sgt. Meese told me that he had been on one operation that transported a saucer so large that a special team we nt before them, lowering all telephone poles and fence posts. Another team followed and replaced them. They moved it only at night. It was kept parked and covered somewhere off the road during the day. Since we were always half-tanked when these stories came out, I never believed them — se rgeants were known to tell some tall tales to younger guys like me. On November 22, 1963, I was on duty as CQ (Charge of Quarters) for the Field Maintenance Squadron. Most of the men were out on the flight- line working, the barracks orderlies ha d been assigned their tasks, the first sergeant was gone somewhere, and I was alone. I turned on the orderly room TV to watch the live broadcast of the President's motorcade in Dallas. I was not prepared for what I saw. I stared in disbelief as the events unfurled in front of my eyes. I knew that something had happened, but what? I had seen and heard the assassination, but my mind was not accepting it. I kept staving at the set to discover what it was that had happened when slowly the realization crept over me. A numbness spread up my arms and legs. I saw what had happened! The hair stood up on the back of my neck and a chill went down my spine. President Kennedy had been shot right in front of my eyes! At that point huge tears began to stream down my face. Waves of emotion rushed through my body. I felt that I had to do something, so I picked up the direct line to the comma nd center. I choked back the tears. When the command duty officer answered, I told him that the President had just been shot in Dallas. There was a pause, and he asked me, \"How do you know he has been shot?\" I told him that 1 had watched it on television and then hung up the phone. I was numb all over. A few minutes later the command duty officer called back and ordered a red alert at DEFCON TWO (Defense Condition Two meant war was imminent).

We had a good bunch of guys in my company and we had a great company commander. Chief Campbell, chief electricians mate. He turned the company over to me. The chief was a good man. He was only inte rested in teaching us what we needed to know and in keeping us ou t of trouble. Unlike most boot camp instructors, Chief Campbell had no axe to grind and wasn't trying to prove anything to himself or anyone else. He was truly our friend. During boot camp I volunteered fo r submarines (my sense of adven- ture was very strong). I was accepted, and upon completion of basic training, was ordered to the USS Tiru (SS-416) at the submarine base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Spitfire and damnation, no one could possibly be that lucky! I couldn't believe my eyes when I read my orders. Here I was fulfilling my dream of be ing in the Navy. I got exac tly what I asked for the first time that I asked fo r it, which was extremely rare in any branch of military service. And to t op it all off, I wa s being sent to Hawaii, the land of tropical paradise. I was in seventh heaven. I landed in Hawaii with no time to play and took a ca b directly to the sub base. My submarine was nowhere to be found. I kept asking people until I found someone who told me that my boat (subs ar e called boats in the Navy) was not at the su b base but in dry dock in the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. I hailed another cab. The cab driver dropped me off at the head of a pier that looked like it had never been clea ned up after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. It was covered with what appeared to be hoses, huge electrical cables, rusting metal of every conceivable size and shape that you can imagine. The air was rank with the smell of diesel, weld ing fumes, paint, and steel. If there"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE is a hell on earth, I thought, this has to be it. I walked up the pier, over to the edge, and looked down in to the dry dock. There, stripped of all dignity, lying naked and cut cleanly in half, was my boat, the USS Tiru. Men were scrambling all over it. Th ey looked like ants sw arming over a dead gras- shopper. Brilliant flashes of light bri ghter than the sun drove sparks high into the air and then down in a beautiful flow to the bottom of the dock. I couldn't believe my eyes. Someone actual ly expected me to go out to sea, then underwater, in what appeared to me to be a motley collection of cut-up rusting metal scavenged from some satanic junkyard, stuck together by demons with welding to rches. My luck had just run out. I reported to the barrack s barge moored in the water on the other side of the pier and was given a hammock for when I had the duty; then I was sent to the sub base barracks where I was assigned a rack and a locker. I wanted to go into Honolulu but quic kly discovered non-quals did not rate liberty. It was getting worse. The next few months we re spent sanding, painti ng, lifting, and learn- ing the boat. The men of the crew, ex cept for the chief cook, were great. The chief cook was drunk every minute of the day and night. He didn't like me, so I didn't get much to eat. His dislike stemmed from my first morning when I walked into the galley and watched as the other crew members ordered their breakfast. Wh en there was an opening I stepped up and asked for eggs over easy. That 's when the chief hit the overhead and vowed that I would never eat a m eal in his mess decks. He wasn't kidding, either. The only time after that morning th at I got anything to eat out of that galley was when the chief cook was ashore. To this day I still don' t know what I did wron g. I could have gone to the captain, but if I had don e that I might as well have put in for a transfer at the same time. It wasn't long, thou gh, before I was ab le to locate where he hid his booze. I made his life miserable from that moment on. I won't tell you what I laced his vodka with, but it wasn't anything you'd ever want to drink, believe me. I kept that chief so sick that he was transferred off the boat for medical reas ons. I didn't want to hu rt him, but it was either get rid of him or starve to death. I ma de up my mind that chief or no chief I wasn't going to go to sea on a boat that wouldn't feed me. I didn't relish going to sea with a dr unk chief in charge of closing the main induction valve when the boat made a dive. When a submarine goes underwater certain valves MUST be cl osed or the boat will flood with water and everyone will drown. The ma in induction is the MOST IMPOR- TANT of those valves. It was the cook 's duty to close it , because the valve was in the galley on board the USS Tiru. I made two especially close friends while on the Tiru. A black seaman"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"William Cooper • 17 named Lincoln Loving and an Ameri can Indian seaman we called Gero- nimo. The three of us were inseparable. Lincoln was best man at my first marriage. Of the three Geronimo was the most experienced seaman, so he taught Lincoln and me. He knew everything there was to know about the boat, rope, paint, and a whole lot of ot her things that a man had to know to survive in the Navy. I knew the most about getting along in the military, so I taught Geronimo and Lincoln. Lincol n knew every really good spot on the Island where we could have a good time, so he led the liberty party. Three things really stand out in my mind about the time that I spent on the Tiru. The first was an incident th at occurred during a test dive while we were creeping along at about 3 or 4 knots at a depth of 600 feet off the Island of Oahu. Lincoln and I had just been relieved from watch and were in the after battery talking when we were knocked off our feet. We heard a loud CLANG forward and felt the boat lunge to port. Then we heard a sound that made our blood run cold. I could literally feel the blood drain from my face as I listened to whatever it was that we hit scrape along the starboard side of the hull. Lincoln and I froze. We held our breath as metal screeched upon metal. I thought it would never end. No one moved, anywhere. Finally, after what seemed a lifetime, the boat lurched and the noise disappeared aft. If it had pierced the hull none of us would be alive today. We never found out what it was. When we returned to Pearl, divers went down to have a look. When they surfaced they reported that the starboard bowplane was damaged and the hull was gouged all along the starboard side from bow to stern. We went in for repairs. In a couple of days we were good as new, but I certainly had an entirely different perspective on life. The second thing that stands out happened to another boat that had been out participating in torpedo att ack exercises with another submarine. I remember seeing the boat entering the harbor with a large tarp over the conning tower. I could see something holding the tarp up on each side of the tower but I couldn't see what it w as. Later, Geronimo, Lincoln and I walked over where the boat was berthed and looked under the tarp. The other boat in the exercise had scored a direct hit! What we saw was a torpedo sticking completely through the sail. We started laughing. Then we looked at each other and decided that it wasn't so funny after all. This submarine business was not quite as attractive as I'd thought. Number three happened during a transit between the Portland-Seattle area and Pearl Harbor. I was the port lookout during the afternoon watch (1200 to 1600 hours). Geronimo was the starboard lookout. Ensign Ball was the OOD (Officer of the Deck). We were doing 10 knots on the surface and the three of us were on the bridge in the conning tower. It was a bright"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"18 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE day, but the sun was obscured by a lo w layer of clouds. It was cool. We had a bit of fun when someone belo w requested permission to put a man on deck forward to get something that was needed from the waterproof deck locker. The locker was under the deck plate all the way up on the bow near the forward torpedo-room escape trunk. Geronimo and I laughed when Ensign Ball gave his approval. He really shouldn't have, because we were running a pressure wave ove r the bow. When we saw who it was they had sent on deck we roared wi th laughter. We lo oked down over the side of the sail at the deck-level do or just as it popped open and Seaman Lincoln Loving stuck his head out. He didn't look happy. Lincoln reached down and put the runner in the safety track in the deck, fastened the safety belt around his waist and, grabbing the handrail, stepped out on deck. He looked up at us with that \"don' t you laugh at me\" look that he did so well. It took him a few minutes to get up the nerve to let go of the handrail and begin to ma ke his way forward against the wind and the pitching deck. Ginge rly, he crept forward un til he was just at the point where the pressure wave was rolling off the deck when the bow heaved free of the wate r on its cyclical upswing. I could see that Lincoln was tryi ng to time a run forward when the bow was out of the water. He made a couple of false starts, then ran slipping on the wet deck, di sappearing into the access hole for the forward torpedo-room escape hatch. The bow plunged underwater and I found myself sucking air as I imagined the co ld saltwater swirli ng around me. It wasn't me, though, it was Lincoln. I gr ipped the top of th e sail as I waited for the bow to swing up, hoping that Lincoln wouldn't panic. What we saw next could have been a clip from one of those old Keystone Cops movies. Lincoln was fla iling water so hard that it looked like he had 40 arms and 40 legs. It was only then that I realized that Lincoln had joined the Navy but he didn't k now how to swim. When he finally gathered a foothold, the half-drowned seaman expl oded up out of that hole like a Polaris missile and ra n back to the conning towe r just as fast as his wet leather soles would carry him. Ensign Ball, Geronimo, an d I laughed for a good ten minutes. In fact, every time we saw Lincoln for the next two days we would burst out laughing. Lincoln didn't think it was funny and didn't miss a chance to slug us every time we laughed. Lincoln went below. Geronimo an d I began the unending task of sweeping the horizon from bow to st ern, then the sky from horizon to zenith, and then back to the horizon from bow to stern.

My heart beat wildly. I tried to talk but couldn't; then I changed my mind and decided I didn't want to say that, anyway. I had se en a flying saucer the size of an aircraft carrier come right out of the ocean and fly into the clouds. I looked around quickly to see if anyone else had seen it. Ensign Ball was stil l bending over the IMC. He was ordering coffee. Geronimo wa s looking down the starboard side aft. I was torn between my du ty to report what I had seen and the knowl- edge that if I did no on e would believe me. As I l ooked out over the ocean I saw only sky, clouds, and water. It was as if nothing had happened. I almost thought I had dreamed it. Ensign Ball straightened, turned towa rd Geronimo and said the coffee was on the way up. I looked back toward the spot, about 15 degrees relative off the port bow, and about 2-1/2 nauti cal miles distant. Nothing, not even a hint of what had happened. \"Ensign Ball,\" I said, \"I thought I saw something about 15 degrees relative off the bow, but I lost it. Can you help me look over that area?\" Ensign Ball turned, raisi ng his glasses to ey e level. I didn't know it at the time, but Geronimo ha d heard me and turned to look. He was happy that something had broken the monotony. I was just lifting the binoculars of f my chest when I saw it. The giant saucer shape plunged out of the clouds, tumbled, and, pushing the water before it, opened up a hole in the ocea n and disappeared from view. It was incredible. This time I had seen it with my naked eyes, and its size in comparison with the total view was nothing short of astounding. Ensign Hall stood in shock, his binoculars in his hands, his mouth open. Geronimo yelled, \"Holy shit! What the — hey! did you guys see that?\" Ensign Ball turned, and looking right at me with the most incredulous look on his face, said in a low voice, \"Thi s had to happen on my watc h!\" He turned, quickly pressing the override on the IMC and yelled, \"Captain to the bridge, Captain to the bridge.\" As an afterth ought he pressed the switch again and yelled, \"Somebody get a camera up here.\" The Captain surged up the ladder wi th the quartermaster on his heels. Chief Quartermaster Quintero had th e ship's 35-mm camera slung around his neck. The Captain stood patiently while Ensign Ball tried to describe what he had seen. He glanced at us and we both nodded in affirmation. That was enough for the Captain. He called sonar, who during the excite- ment had reported contact underwater at the same bearing. The Captain announced into the 1MC, \"This is the Captain. I have the conn.\" The reply"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE came back instantly from the helm, \"Aye , Aye sir.\" I knew that the helms- man was passing the word in the control room that the Captain had personally taken control of the boat. I also knew that rumors were probab- ly flying through the vessel. The Captain called down and ordered someone to closely monitor the radar. His command was in stantly acknowledged. As the five of us stood gazing out over the sea the same ship or one exactly like it rose slowly, turned in the air, tilted at an angl e and then vanished. I saw the Chief snapping pictures out of the corner of my eye. This time I had three images from which to draw conclusions. It was a metal machine, of that there was no doubt whatsoever. It was intelligent- ly controlled, of that I was equally sure. It was a dull color, kind of like pewter. There were no lights. There was no glow. I thought I had seen a row of what looked like por tholes, but could not be certain. Radar reported contact at the same bearing and gave us a range of 3 nautical miles. The range was right on, as the craft had moved toward the general direction that we were headed. We watched repe atedly as the strange craft reentered the water and then subsequently rose into the clouds over and over again until finally we knew that it was gone for good. The episode lasted about 10 minutes. Before leaving the brid ge the Captain took the camera from the Chief and instructed each of us not to talk to a nyone about what we had seen. He told us the incident was classified an d we were not to di scuss it, not even amongst ourselves. We acknowledged his order. The Captain and the Chief left the bridge. En sign Ball stepped to the 1MC and, pressing the override switch, announced, \"This is En sign Ball. The Captain has left the bridge. I have the conn.\" The reply, \"Aye aye sir,\" quickly followed. Those of us who had witnessed the UFO were not allowed to go ashore after we had berthed in Pearl. Even those of us who didn't have the duty were told we had to stay aboa rd. After about two hours a commander from the Office of Nava l Intelligence boarded. He went directly to the Captain's stateroom. It wasn't long before we were called to wait in the passageway outside the Ca ptain's door. Ensign Ball was called first. After about 10 minutes he came out and we nt into the wardroom. He looked shaken. I was next. When I entered the stateroom, th e Commander was hol ding my ser- vice record in hi s hands. He wanted to know why I had gone from the Air Force into the Navy. I told him the w hole story and he la ughed when I said that after putting off the Navy for fear of chronic seasickne ss, I hadn't been seasick yet. Suddenly a mask dropped over his face, and looking me directly in the eyes he asked, \"What did you see out there?\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"WilliamCooper • 21 \"I believe it was a flying saucer, sir,\" I answered. The man began to visibly shake and he screamed obscenities at me. He threatened to put me in the brig for the rest of my life. I thought he wasn't going to stop yelling, but as suddenly as he began, he stopped. I was confused. I had answered his question truthfully; yet I was threatened with prison. I was not af raid, but I was not very confident, either. I figured I had better take another tack. Eighteen years with my father and four years in the Air Fo rce had taught me something. Number one was that officers just do not lose control like that, ever. Number two was that if my answer had elicited that explosion, then the next thing out of my mouth had better be something entirely different. Number three was, that his response had been an act of ki ndness to get me to arrive at exactly that conclusion. \"Let's start all over again,\" he said. \"What did you see out there?\" \"Nothing, sir,\" I answered. \"I didn't see a damn thing, and I'd like to get out of here just as soon as possible.\" A smile spread over his face and th e Captain looked relieved. \"Are you sure, Cooper?\" he asked. \"Yes sir,\" I replied, \"I'm sure.\" \"You're a good sailor, Cooper,\" he said. 'The Navy needs men like You'll go far with the Navy.\" He then asked me to read several pieces of paper that all said the same thing only with different words. I read that if I ever talked about what it was that I didn't see, I could be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to 10 years or both. In addition I could lose all pay and allowances due or ever to become due. He asked me to sign a piece of paper stating that I understood the laws and regulations that I had just read governing the safeguard of classified information relating to the national security. By signing, I agreed never to communicate in any man- ner any information regarding the in cident with anyone. I was dismissed, and boy, was I glad to get out of there. Not long after that incident I devolunteered from submarines. I was transferred to the USS Tombigbee (AOG-11). The Tombigbee was a gasoline tanker. It was more dangerous than the sub. The Captain was crazy and the crew was a combination of idiots and misfits. I once had to draw my pistol while I was petty officer of the watch to prevent an officer from being attacked by a seaman. The Tombigbee collided in the dead of night with a destroyer in the Molokai channel and several men died when the destroyer was almost cut in half.

I made two WESTPAC tours aboard the Tombigbee. They included a total of 12 months off the coast of Vietnam. We came under machine-gun fire while anchored off Chu Lai. We had to do an emergency breakaway and leave the harbor. All we needed was one tracer round in one of the tanks, and KA-BOOM, it would have been all over. The Viet Cong gunner probably got busted because the stupid jerk missed the whole damn ship. HOW CAN YOU MISS A WHOLE SHIP? The only other time I felt threatened was when we went up to a small outpost at the DM2 called Cua Viet. It was a vision right out of hell. Cua Viet sat on the southern bank at the river mouth of the Thack Han river. We rode at anchor and pumped fuel as hore through a bottom lay line. Every night we could see the tracers from fire fights raging up and down the river and along the DMZ. It was a real hot spot. Every once in awhile Viet Cong or NVA rockets would slam into the camp. We would perform an emer- gency breakaway and put to sea until the all clear was sounded. Everything was cool until our whacko Captain decided we were going into the river mouth. Did you ever try to put a pencil through the eye of a needle? Thaf s about comparable to what we did. I'll never know how we got that big ship through the narrow mouth of that river with no naviga- tional references whatsoever. We dropped anchor midchannel and the Captain backed the ship right up to the beach and dropped the stern anchor into the sand. There we sat, a great big target full of gasoline. We were helpless in the mouth of a narrow river, with three anchors out, right in the middle of one of the hottest co mbat zones in Vietnam. That night several men in the crew wrote letter s to the Chief of Naval Operations requesting an immediate transfer. No one slept. I don't know why the enemy didn't send in the rockets, but they didn't. I knew then that God must keep a special watch over fools. The next day we set to sea and started for Pearl. The Captain was relieved for incompetence later that year. Then I was transferred to school. I didn't know what school I had drawn. It turned out to be the Naval Security and Intelligence School for Inte rnal Security Specialist (NEC 9545). The general training prepared me to set up security perimeters, secure installations and buildings, and safe guard classified information. My training included special weapons, booby-trap identification and disarm- ing, the detection of bugs, phone ta ps, transmitters and many other sub- jects. I was specifically trained to prepare and conduct Pacific-area intelligence briefings.

This was the first good news I'd had since leaving boot camp. I really wanted to fight for my country. I wasn't to find out what a real fool I was until a few years later. I landed at Da Nang and was bused to Camp Carter, the headquarters for Naval Security and Intelligence in I Corps. I was interviewed by Captain Carter, the commanding officer. The names turned out to be a coincidence. Captain Cart er asked me if I thought I would make a good patrol boat captain, and I to ld him that I would. What else could I tell him? I thought he was joking when he told me I would have command of a boat and crew. He wasn't, and I did. Lt. Duey at the Harbor Patrol, a division of Naval Intelligence, allowed me to hand-pick a crew. He gave me first choice of four 45-foot picket boats th at had just been unloaded from the deck of a freighter. I a nd my new crew spent thre e days going over every inch of that boat. We ad justed and fine-tuned ev erything. We sanded and painted. One of the seamen even h ung curtains in the after cabin. We checked and double-checked the e ngines. My gunners mate, GMG3 Robert G. Barron, checked out weapons and we began to arm our vessel. I've got to tell you the truth — just looking at al l those guns scared the shit out of me. I vowed right then and there that I would be the best damn captain that ever commanded a combat vessel in wartime. I learned to exist an only 2 or 3 hours of sleep out of 24 a nd never ate until I knew that my crew had been fed. We spent a lot of spooky nights patrolling the Da Nang harbor and river. One night a rocket hit the ammo dump at the river's edge near the Da Nang bridge, and it really looked as if the world was coming to an end. Another time we engaged th e enemy in the cove at Point Isabella near the marine fuel farm and probably saved their butts. That engagement was reported in The Stars and Stripes, th e armed forces newspaper in Vietnam. The worst moments came, however , not from Charley but from mother nature. A full-blow n typhoon roared across the Gulf of Tonkin. To save the boats we put to sea. The ange ls must have been laughing. What a sight we must have made! I maneuvered our boat in between two giant cargo ships riding at anchor off Red Beach and learned qui ckly what fear was really all about. The wind was blow ing so hard that none of us could go on deck. That meant that the two of us in the pilot house were stuck on watch and the men trapped in the afte r cabin had to man the hand pumps. The windows in the pilot house blew out and the rain felt like knives hitting our skin. Water pour ed in, and I prayed that the men on the pumps would not become exhauste d.

When we were in the trough we seemed to be in danger of their crashing down upon us. One of th e freighters snapped a ca ble and steamed slowly out of the harbor. The next morning the storm calmed and we moved into the river. Debris was floating down and we had to play do dge-the-tree-trunks until we spotted a sheltered pier in front of the Press Club. We carefully pulled the boat alongside, tied fast to the pi er, then collapsed from exhaustion. After awhile we drew st raws to see who would re main on watch with me. The rest went into the Press Club. After a couple of hours the crew returned and we went in. It was like nothing was going on outside. Reporters sat around drinking or eat ing. All around fl owed conversation and laughter. We ordered a huge meal , signed Lt. Duey's name to the check, then went out to the boat. I don't know whose name the other guys signed, but none of us had any money. I don't even know if Lt. Duey ever got the bill. I do know that it was one of the best damn m eals that we ever had in that country. The next two days were spent in repairing the boat, cleaning the weapons, and checking everything. Then we went to the club, got stone drunk, and slept for damn near a whole other day. Bob Barron volunteered for Cua Viet. I begged him to stay with us. Maybe we could all go up later together . He couldn't wait; he had to have action. We promised each other that if one of us bought the farm the other would drink a bottle of scotch in memory, then break the bottle on the rocks. Don't ask me what that was all about. Men who think they might die at any given moment do stupid thi ngs and I was no different than most. About three weeks later we learned that Bob's boat had gone on TWO LIMA patrol on the Thack Han River one night and had never returned. No radio transmissions were ever heard. And for awhile no bodies were found. Then one by one they popped to the surface along the bank. It was a long time before we ever found the boat. When we did it was twisted up like a pretzel.

We had individual 24-hour crypto code sheets that we used to encode messages, but because of the danger that one of them could be cap tured at any time, we used special code words for sensitive information.

On the day that I learned that the Office of Naval Intelligence had participated in the assassination of President John F.

I believed it was all true then and I believe it is all true now. I must warn you, however, that I have found evidence that the secret societies were planning as far back as 1917 to invent an artificial threat from outer space in order to bring humanity together in a one-world govern- ment which they call the New World Order. I am still searching for the truth. I firmly believe that this book is closer to that truth than anything ever previously written. I attempted to leak information to a reporter after my discharge. I was forced off a cliff by a black limo in the hills of Oakland. Two men got out and climbed down to where I lay covere d in blood. One bent down and felt for my carotid pulse. The other asked if I was dead. The nearest man said, \"No, but he will be.\" The other replie d, \"Good, then we don't have to do anything else.\" They climbed up and drove off. I succeeded in climbing up the bank where I waited until found. A month later I was forced into another accident by the same limo. This time I was to lose my leg. Two men visited me in the hospital. They only wanted to know if I would shut up or if the next time should be final. I told them that I would be a very good little boy and that they needn't worry about me anymore. Under my breath I swore to spill the beans as soon as I could figure out how to do it without unit getting hurt again. It took 16 years, $27,000, a computer and a lot of envelopes, but now everyone knows. I went back to school after leaving the Navy and obtained a degree in photography, served as the Chief Instructor of the Coastal School of Deep Sea Diving, the head of the Mixed Ga s Deep Saturation Diving Department and the underwater photography instructor for the College of Oceaneer- ing, Admissions representative for Airco Technical Institute, Assistant Director of Adelphi Business College, Executive Director of Adelphi Busi- ness College, National Marketing Coor dinator of United Education &"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE Software, Executive Director of Pacifi c Coast Technical Institute, and Ex- ecutive Director of National Technical College. I also owned and operated Absolute Image Gallery and Studio of Fine Art Photography. In the spring of 1988 I saw a magazine that made reference to a document discovered by the research team of Moore, Shandera, and Fried- man that outlined the government's knowledge of a downed saucer, dead alien bodies, and an operation ca lled Operation MAJESTIC TWELVE. I knew that Moore and Friedman were government agents and the docu- ment was a fraud. I had never heard of Shandera. I knew this because I had seen a list of agents who were to initiate a contingency plan called MAJESTIC that would lead investigator s off the track wh en such a need arose. I decided that it was time for me to enter the arena and expose the cover-up and the disinformation. First it was necessary to convince the known agents that I was just a kook who didn't really know anything. I prepared some bogus information, mixe d it with some true information, and passed it to Moore and Friedman through Jim Spieser, the operator of a computer BBS network called Paranet. Spieser was told that the informa- tion was to go only to Moore or Friedman; no one else was to see it. I wanted to buy time by convincing these agents to report me to their case officers as harmless, thus allowing me to get the real information out to the public. None of that information was intended to go to the public. Spieser turned out to be working with Moore, however, and posted the files on the computer networks. Spieser then went to Los Angeles, conferred with Moore for three days, then return ed and barred me from the Paranet system. Friedman called and elicited my a ddress, the name and address of my employer, and a lot of other personal information. I knew that I was being checked out through the intelligence network and played along. About one week after talking to Friedman two Defense Investigative Service agents showed up at my home and confiscated all my floppy disks. The only thing that prevented them from taking my computer was the fact that it was an XT with no hard drive. I kn ew that my plan had worked, because they didn't take me. With the help of Annie and a few very close and trusted friends, I prepared the real information, as true and correct as I could remember, and together we did a mailing that, all total, cost me $27,000. We sent the packages to people all over the world. That is what prevented the govern- ment from arresting me or harming me. Any move by them would be interpreted as total confirmation of everything that I had revealed. I also uploaded the information onto computer bulletin boards all across the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"William Cooper • 29 nation. At the same time I publicly stated that Moore, Shandera, and Friedman are government agents and that the Eisenhower briefing docu- ment is a fraud. I was attacked by everyone. They insisted that Moore, Shandera, and Friedman were above reproach. I resigned effective April 15,1989, from the college where I was the Executive Director after Jaime Shandera was seen poking around the grounds. That story is included later in this book. The loss of income was a serious blow. Stan Barrington, the h ead of the college security depart- ment, came to our aid. Stan gave us $5,000 to help out. I was deeply moved by his faith and trust in me, and so I gave him 24% of whatever was to come out of my efforts down the line. Neither of us ever expected much, and so far we have not been wrong. I have, however, paid Stan back his money, and now whatever he earns is extra. Stan is in charge of printing information and the sale of my papers and tapes. Stan Barrington is my only authorized representative. Moore was proved to be an agent when by his own admission on July 1, 1989, he stated he had participated in spying on fellow researchers, had changed documents, had put out disi nformation, and had helped run a scam on Paul Bennowicz that had resulted in Mr. Bennowicz being con- fined to a mental institution. Moore stat ed that he had been recruited by an intelligence agency and that he knew he had been recruited. He was a witting agent. No one acknowledged that I had been right. From that point on, my Annie and I were followed and harassed. Death threats began showing up on our answering machine. The phone would ring several times during the ni ght, but no one would reply when we answered. Sometimes a man would deliver another death threat. Government cars would park in fro nt and well-dressed men watched the house. The strangest people began to show up at our door, sometimes in the middle of the night. I purchased a .380 automatic for Annie and a 9-mm for me. I taught Annie how to shoot, and she will not hesitate to kill anyone who attempts to harm me, her, or our little daughter. Annie and Pooh (Dorothy's nickname) are the lights in my life. Annie and I were married on July 4,1989. Pooh was born on May 30,1990. My most touching memory of Annie is of the time after 12 hours of labor when we were finally in the delivery room . She had taken no drugs. She had not been given a spinal tap. She did everything naturally. She was drained of energy and was experiencing great pain. She was numb. After a really hard push she looked up at me with all the innocence and trust of a little child and asked, \"Did the baby come yet?\" It was very hard for me to tell her that the baby had not yet been born, but that is what I did.

I could see the love in her eyes as she looked up at me. I squeezed her hand. She t ook a deep breath and pu shed Pooh's little head out into the world.

I s howed the man in the car my 9-mm pistol and told him that we were fe d up with their intimidating tactics. I told him that if he or anyone else wanted to know something about me, they should come to the house, sit down, have a cup of coffee, and I would be happy to tell them anything that they want to know. I informed him that if any further attempt was made to harass me or my family I would not hesitate to use my pistol. I then walked behind his car and wrote the license number down. He started the car, drove off, and we have not detected any overt signs of surveillance since that day. They did not give up on us. No one knew the location of our new house when we moved to Arizona. However, when we drove into the driveway, a government car showed up right behind us. The man got out and said he was lost and wanted to know who lived here. I asked him why he wanted to know. He stated that he was a census taker. He said it was his job to ensure that no one out here in the country was left out of the census. He asked my name. I told him to get off the property and to not ever come back. He protested, but left when he saw that I was serious. (I merely asked Annie to get my pistol out of the car.) Now, many people would say that I was paranoid in this instan ce — until they discover that census takers DO NOT DRIVE GOVERNMENT CARS. I was at the post office one morning when a county sheriff's deputy asked the clerk at the window next to the one where I was buying stamps if \"William Cooper\" had rented a box. I smiled as the clerk handed him my rental agreement and he copied the information. He didn't learn anything, as we live in the country where there are no addresses. The form had only \"Stolen Blvd.\" listed — a lot of people live on Stolen Boulevard. We have been taken advantage of by every crooked con man, TV producer, scriptwriter, author, and flim -flam expert that there is in this country. I have learned that the TV and print-media reporters and producers that I have met are a pack of liars. They are not objective and don't give a damn about the truth. The only really open media left to the public is talk radio, and even talk ra dio won't discuss certain subjects. My material has been copied, changed, and even plagiarized. A lot of people have used my material to make mo ney without my knowledge or permis- sion. A Hollywood producer wanted to buy the exclusive rights to my story for ONE DOLLAR! Bill Hamilton begged me to let him include my material in his book entitled Alien Magic. He pretended to be a friend and I let him. I asked for no money and he offered none. His entir e book consists of other people's material. He now accuses me of stealing \"his\" information. Bill Hamilton"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE turned out to be just another UFO flak e. I have since learned that I am not the only person of whom he has taken advantage. The most damaging scam was perpetrated by two old, has-been actors turned con men, named Michael Callan and Douglas Deane. I doubt seriously that you will remember either one, Callan was a regular in the cheapy teen beach-blanket movies a nd Deane never got beyond bit parts and chorus lines. I got involved with them when another actor named Bruce Reed called and asked if I woul d consent to meet with him and a friend who preferred to remain anonym ous. I agreed that they could come to the house where we could talk on familiar turf. I was not eager to meet with someone that I did not know, and especially with an anonymous person away from familiar surroundings. Reed and friend showed up at my home, and the friend turned out to be Michael Callan. They told me th at they had read my material and wanted to help. What a joke that stat ement turned out to be! They told me that they knew how to get me in front of millions of people where I could deliver my message. Callan was slick; he told me he was only interested in helping spread the information, but talked me into signing a five-year management contract that gave him a full 20% of the gross of all of my earnings no matter what the source. He swore that if he didn't show results within six months he would tear up the contract. The first thing that Callan did was shaft his partner, Bruce Reed. He cut Reed out of the action. To prevent me from finding out that he had done it only to get Reed's half of the 20%, Callan told me that Bruce was a drug dealer. Callan said that the public would find out eventually, and Reed's drug involvement would damage me. Everything Callan told me about Reed turned out to be a lie. Stan Barrington called me next, wanting to know why I was trying to dump him. I didn't know what he was talking about. It turned out that Callan was trying to force Stan into giving up his 24% so that Callan could form a 50-50 partnership with me. I told Stan that I had no intention of dumping him. I told him that his 24% was his, that he could keep it, sell it, or give it away and that he did not need my permission. Stan felt much better after that conversation and told Callan to go fly a kite. At that point Callan began working on me to get rid of Stan. I refused. I also told him that he had nothing invested and therefore did not warrant anything. His job was to manage according to our contract. Douglas Deane entered the picture at the January 7,1989, lecture that I gave at the Showboat Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Callan brought him to videotape the lecture so that we would have a tape to sell for those thousands of people who pleaded with us to produce a tape. The agree-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"William Cooper • 33 ment was that he would tape the event and the tapes would belong ex- clusively to me. In return, if the ta pes turned out good, Deane would get a contract to produce future tapes. The tapes were terrible and I told both Deane and Callan that I did not want tapes of that poor quality being sold to anyone. They did it anyway behind my back and began the process of stealing my master tapes from all of my other lectures. At the same time Callan drained all the business accounts. He borrowed $1400 from Stan to produce tapes and then kept the money and the tapes. A producer in Germany booked me to do a lecture in that country. To secure the agreement he sent $3,000 to be used for two first-class tickets and as a guarantee that when I got there I would not be cancelled. The pro- ducer cancelled when a German postal strike prevented him from advertis- ing the event. Callan kept the man's $3,000. I did not find out about that until after I fired Callan. At my lecture in San Diego at the Whole Life Expo I found out that Deane was selling tapes and asking peopl e to make checks out to \"Need to Know Productions,\" a phony company. I immediately fired Deane. I informed Callan that we were to do no more business with him what- soever. I discovered that Callan was te lling me that we were having tapes duplicated in Hollywood for $15 per ta pe, but in reality Deane was doing it on VCRs at his home in Arizona. I asked Callan to return all of my master tapes for all my lectures. He refused and I fired him. When I got rid of Callan, he had stolen everything that we had. We were literally left penniless. He was in possession of all of our master tapes from all of my lectures. We were broke and homeless at that point. If it had not been for a few good friends in Minnesota, we would not have survived. We would be in the streets today. Ca llan and Deane continue to injure us by selling tapes from my lectures. We get nothing from those sales. They are the most despicable con men and thieves that you can imagine. I paid a visit to Deane's home one Saturday morning to ask him for my master tapes. He was not home, and after a polite conversation with his handyman, I returned to my home. A few days later the sheriff's depart- ment called and asked me if I had been to Deane's home that same Satur- day. I told him that I had. He asked me if I had tried to break in Deane's home and I told him that I had not. He thanked me and that was the end of it. I had no idea what it was all about until I was served with a retraining order. It seems that Deane's guilty conscience had made him afraid that I would return. He slit his own tires, made a report to the sheriff that I had done it, and then procured a restraining order from the local court.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION Silent weapon technology has evol ved from Operations Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical me thodology developed under the MILI- TARY MANAGEMENT [Eisenhower] in England during World War II. The original purpose of Operations Res earch was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defens e with the objective of effective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e., logistics). It was soon recognized by those in positions of power [THE COUN- CIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS] that the same methods might be useful for totally controlling a society. But better tools were necessary. Social engineering (the analysis and automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amounts of co nstantly changing economic informa-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper tion (data), so a high-speed comput erized data-processing system was necessary which could race ahead of th e society and predict when society would arrive for capitulation. Relay computers were t oo slow, but the electroni c computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill. The next breakthrough was the devel opment of the simplex method of linear programing in 1947 by the ma thematician George B. Dantzig. Then in 1948, the transistor, invented by J. Bardeen, W. H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion of the computer fi eld by reducing space and power requirements. With these three inventio ns under their direction, those in positions of power strongly suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with the push of a button. Immediately, the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION got in on the ground floor by making a four-year gr ant to HARVARD COLLEGE, fund- ing the HARVARD ECONOMIC RESEARCH PROJECT for the study of the structure of the American economy. One year later, in 1949, THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE joined in. In 1952 the origin al grant period terminated, and a high-level meeting of the ELITE [Illuminati] was held to determine the next phase of social operations research. The Harvard proj ect had been very fruitful, as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting the feasibility of economic (social) engineer ing. (Studies in the Structure of the American Economy — copyright 1953 by Wa ssily Leontief, International Sci- ences Press Inc., White Plains, New York.) Engineered in the last half of the decade of the 1940s, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak, in sparkling gold-pl ated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954. With the creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking UN LIMITED SOURCES OF FUSION ATOMIC ENER GY FROM THE HEAVY HYDROGEN IN SEA WATER and the consequent av ailability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away. The combination wa s irresistible. The QUIET WAR was quietly DECL ARED by the INTERNATIONAL ELITE [THE BILDERBERG GROUP] at a meeting held in 1954. Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the evolution of the new we apon-system has never suffered any major setbacks. This volume marks the 25th annivers ary of the beginn ing of the Quiet War. Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout the world."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 39 POLITICAL INTRODUCTION In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public would be able to grasp and upset the cr adle of power, for the very elements of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public Utopia as they were for providing a private Utopia. The ISSUE of PRIMARY CONCERN, that of DOMINANCE, revolved a round the subject of the energy sciences. ENERGY Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as econom ics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the book- keeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping. All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. [THE END ALWAYS JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.] Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so- called \"moral issues\" were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intel- ligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent. CONSEQUENTLY, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the Amer- ican public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-discip lined, responsible, and worthy few. In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it tu rned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public ap- pearance as to earn for themselve s the name \"silent weapons.\" In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the magnates capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods) and vices, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predict- able and manipulative. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the low-class ele- ments of the society must be brought under total control, i.e., must be"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower- class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoc- cupation of the parents and the est ablishment of government-operated day-care centers for the occupationally orphaned children. The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains inco mprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order, peace, and tranquility for the ruling upper class. DESCRIPTIVE INTRODUCTION OF THE SILENT WEAPON Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of junctioning. It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of a chemical reaction (explos ion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; oper- ated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious explosive noi ses, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable \"noise,\" causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably inte rferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being a ttacked and subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong [ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?], but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associat e with others to defend themselves against it. When a silent weapon is applied gr adually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 41 crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by know- ing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION Give me control over a nation's currency, and I care not who makes its laws. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743 - 1812) Today's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered, succinctly expressed, and e ffectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component of economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think of his discovery in these 20th-century terms, and, to be sure, mathematical analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Rev- olution, the rise of the theory of me chanics and electronics, and finally, the invention of the electronic computer be fore it could be effectively applied in the control of the world economy. GENERAL ENERGY CONCEPTS In the study of energy systems, th ere always appear three elementary concepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipa- tion. And corresponding to these concep ts, there are three idealized, essen- tially pure physical counterparts called passive components. (1) In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of poten- tial energy is associated with a physical property called elasticity or stiff- ness, and can be represented by a stretched spring. In electronic science, potential energy is stored in a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacita nce instead of elasticity or stiff - ness. (2) In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical property called inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass or a flywheel in motion. In electronic science, kinetic energy is stored in an inductor (in a magnetic field) instead of a mass. This property is called inductance in- stead of inertia. (3) In the science of physical m echanics, the phenomenon of energy"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper dissipation is associated with a physi cal property called friction or resis- tance, and can be represented by a da shpot or other devi ce which converts system energy into heat. In electronic science, dissipation of energy is performed by an element called either a resistor or a conductor, the term \"resistor\" being the one generally used to expres s the concept of friction, and the term \"conductor\" being generally used to describe a more idea l device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronic energy efficien tly from one locati on to another. The property of a resistance or conductor is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals. In economics these three energy concepts are as sociated with: (1) Economic Capacitance — Capital (money, stock/inventory, invest- ments in buildings and durables, etc.) (2) Economic Conductance — Goods (p roduction flow coefficients) (3) Economic Inductance — Se rvices (the influenc e of the population of industry on output) All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of one energy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, et c.) can be immediatel y applied in the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics). MR. ROTHSCHILD'S ENERGY DISCOVERY What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle is \"when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to you.\" Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to INDUCE PEOPLE [WC emphasis] (inductance, with people corresponding to a mag- netic field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real co mpensation). They would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr . Rothschild found that he could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone's stock of gold as a pers uader to show to his customers. Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individuals and to governments. These would create overc onfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of th e system, and coll ect the collateral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a wa r. Then he would control the avail- ability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give hi m control of its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit de rived from this economic methodology made Mr."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 43 Rothschild all the more able to exte nd his wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed by government order BEYOND THE LIMITS [WC emphasis] (inflation) of backing in precious metal or the production of goods and services (gross national product, GNP). APPARENT CAPITAL AS \"PAPER\" INDUCTOR In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called \"currency,\" has the appearance of capital, but is, in fact, negative capital. Hence, it has the appearance of service, but is, in fact, indebtedness or debt. It is there- fore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance, and if balanced in no other way, will be ba lanced by the negation of population (war, genocide). The total goods and services represent real capital called the gross national product, and currenc y may be printed up to this level and still represent economic capacitan ce; but currency printed beyond this level is subtractive, represents th e introduction of economic inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness. War is therefore the balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public which we have taught to exchange true value for inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources of nature and regeneration of those resources. Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to his own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positions which would encourage the great- est economic instability and oscillation. The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient data and high-speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic oscillations created by pric e shocking and excess paper energy credits — paper inductance/inflation. BREAKTHROUGH The aviation field provided the greatest evolution in economic en- gineering by way of the mathematical theory of shock testing. In this process, a projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe and wired to chart recorders. By studying the echoes or reflections of the recoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover critical vibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations of the engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of the two, mi ght reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of the airframe in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"44 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper of engineering, this means that the st rengths and weakness es of the struc- ture of the airframe in terms of vibr ational energy can be discovered and manipulated. APPLICATION IN ECONOMICS To use this method of airframe shoc k testing in econo mic engineering, the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction is monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically by computer s and the psycho-economic structure of the econ- omy is thus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and make possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative con- sumer structure). Then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal with its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer-r egulated social energy bookkeeping system. Eventually every individual element of the structure comes under computer control throu gh a knowledge of personal preferences, such know ledge guaranteed by computer associ ation of consumer preferences (uni- versal product code — UPC — zebra- stripe pricing codes on packages) with identified consumers (identified via association with the use of a credit card and LATER A PERM ANENT \"TATTOOED\" BODY NUMBER [WC emphasis] invisible under normal ambient illumination.... THE ECONOMIC MODEL ...The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension of World War II Operations Research. It s purpose was to discover the science of controlling an economy : at first the American economy, and then the world economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation and data, it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of an economy as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Such has proven to be the case. Mo reover, the economy has b een transformed into a guided missile on target. The immediate aim of the Harvard project was to discover the eco- nomic structure, what forces change th at structure, how the behavior of the structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What was needed was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures and interrelationships of investment, production, distribution, and con- sumption."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 45 To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and practical and computer know-how developed fo r the electronic field could be directly applied in the stu dy of economics. This discovery was not openly declared, and its more sub tle implications were and are kept a closely guarded secret, for example th at in an economic model, human life in measured in dollars, and that th e electric spark generated when opening a switch connected to an active inducto r is mathematically analogous to the initiation of a war. The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was the ac- curate description of the household as an industry. This is a challenge because consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is in- fluenced by income, price, and other economic factors. This hurdle was cleared in an indi rect and statistically approximate way by an application of shock tes ting to determine the current charac- teristics, called current technical co efficients, of a household industry. Finally, because problems in theoretical econom ics can be translated very easily into problems in theoretical electronics, and the solution trans- lated back again, it follows that onl y a book of language translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics. The remainder could be gotten from sta ndard works on mathematic s and electronics. This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary, and greatly simplifies project security. INDUSTRIAL DIAGRAMS An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from other industries in several forms and converts [it] into one specific product for sales and distribution to other industries. It has several inputs and one output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really an industrial complex where several industries under one roof produce one or more products.... THREE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES Industries fall into three categori es or classes by type of output: Class #1 — Capital (resources) Class #2 — Goods (commodities or use — dissipative) Class #3 — Services (action of population) Class #1 industries ex ist at three levels: (1) Nature - sources of ener gy and raw materials. (2) Government - printing of currency equal to gross national product"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper (GNP), and extension (inflation) of currency in excess of GNP. (3) Banking - loaning of money for interest, and extension (inflation/ counterfeiting) of economic valu e through deposit loan accounts. Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer (dis- sipated) products. Th is sort of activity is usually recogni zed and labeled by the public as an \"industry.\" Class #3 industries are those which ha ve service rather than a tangible product as their output. These industries are calle d (1) househol ds, and (2) governments. Their output is human activity of a mechanical sort, and their basis is population. AGGREGATION The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry model if one allows the names of the outputs to be (1) capital, (2) goods, and (3) services. Th e problem with this representation is that it would not show the influence of, say, the text ile industry on the ferrous metal in- dustry. This is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metal industry would be contained within a single classification called the \"goods industry\" and by this process of combining or aggregating these two industries under one system bloc k they would lose their economic individuality. THE E-MODEL A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production, distribution, consumption, and investme nt. If all of these elements includ- ing labor and human functi ons are assigned a numerical value in like units of measure, say, 1939 dollars , then this flow can be further represented by a current flow in an electr onic circuit, and its behavi or can be pr edicted and manipulated with useful precision. The three ideal passive energy components of electronics, the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three ideal passive energy components of economics called the pure industries of capital, goods, and services, respectively. Economic capacitance represents the storage of capital in one form or another. Economic conductance re presents the level of conductance of mater- ials for the production of goods. Economic inductance repr esents the inertia of economic value in mo- tion. This is a po pulation phenomenon known as services."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 47 ECONOMIC INDUCTANCE An electrical inductor (e. g., a coil of wire) has an electric current as its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon (inertia). Corresp onding to this, an economic i nductor has a flow of econo- mic value as its primary phenomenon a nd a population field as its secon- dary phenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic value (e.g., money) diminishes, the human populatio n field collapses in order to keep the economic value (money) flow ing (extreme case — war). This public inertia is a result of consumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is gene rally a phenomenon of self-preservation. INDUCTIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER (1) Population (2) Magnitude of the eco nomic activities of the government (3) The method of financing th ese government activities (See Peter-Paul Principle — inflation of the currency.) TRANSLATION (A few examples will be given.) Charge — coulombs — dollars (1939). Flow/Current — amperes (coulombs per second) — dollars of flow per year. Motivating Force — volts — dollars (output) demand. Conductance — amperes per volt — do llars of flow per year per dol- lar demand. Capacitance — coulombs per volt — dollars of production inventory/ stock per dollar demand. TIME FLOW RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE OSCILLATIONS An ideal industry may be symbolized electronic ally in various ways. The simplest way is to represent a de mand by a voltage and a supply by a current. When this is done, the re lationship between the two becomes What is called an admittance, which ca n result from three economic factors: (1) hindsight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) foresight flow. Foresight flow is the result of that property of livin g entities to cause energy (food) to be stored for a period of low en ergy (e.g., a winter season). It consists of demands made upon an economic system fo r that period of low energy (winter season)."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"48 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper In a production industry it takes se veral forms, one of which is known as production stock or inventory. In electronic symbology this specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is represented by capacitance and the stock or resource is represente d by a stored charge. Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loading effe ct of inventory priorities. Present flow ideally involves no dela ys. It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a \"hand to mouth\" flow. In electronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure use in dustry) is represented by a conduc- tance which is then a si mple economic valve (a dissipative element). Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia. In electronics this phen- omenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economic analog = a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog = flow of money) creates a magnetic field (eco nomic analog = active human popula- tion) which, if the current (money flow ) begins to diminish, collapse (war) to maintain the current (flow of money — energy). Other large alternatives to war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-e nded social welfare program, or an ENORMOUS (but fruitful) OPEN-ENDED SPA CE PROGRAM [WC emphases]. The problem with stabilizing the eco nomic system is that there is too much demand on account of (1) too much greed an d (2) too mu ch popula- tion. This creates excessive economic i nductance which can only be bal- anced with economic capaci tance (true resour ces or value — e.g., in goods or services). The social welfare program is nothi ng more than an open-ended credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive people a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can be useful, however, because th e recipients become state property in return for the \"gift,\" a standing army for the e lite. For he who pays the piper picks the tune. Those who get hooked on the economic drug, mu st go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of intr oducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future \"credit\" of the world. This is a fourth law of motion — onset, and cons ists of performing an action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns to the point of action — a delayed reaction. The means of surviving the reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this means, politicians become popular in their own time and the public pays for it la ter. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 49 The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the gross nationa l product, an economic process called inflation. [Note: REMEMBER THAT INFLATION IS ONLY THE ACT OF PRINTING MONEY IN EXCESS OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THEY COULD BLAME IT ON THE PRICE OF WIDGETS OR OIL ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW THE REAL CAUSE. THE REAL CAUSE AND THE ONLY CAUSE OF INFLATION IS THE PRINTING OF MORE MONEY BEYOND THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT.] This puts a large quantity of money into the ha nds of the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a fa lse self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door. They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the poli- ticians are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the respon- sibility and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and social-economic structuring.) If the people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their appetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum. Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint, there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system. (1) Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which will only result in a total destruction of the living earth. (2) Take control of the world by th e use of economic \"silent weapons\" in a form of \"quiet warfare\" and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide. The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary. The gene ral public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd of proliferat- ing barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth. They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have not been able to avoid war d espite religious morality, and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them. It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive, to solve the probl em for themselves as the few who really care. Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity...."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY The industries of fina nce (banking), manufac turing, and government, real counterparts of the pure industries of capital, goods, and services, are easily defined because they are generally logically structured. Because of this their processes can be described mathematically and their technical coefficients can be easily deduced. Th is, however, is not the case with the service industry known as the household industry. HOUSEHOLD MODELS ...The problem which a theoretical ec onomist faces is that the con- sumer preferences of any household is not easily predictable and the tech- nical coefficients of any one house hold tend to be a nonlinear, very complex, and variable functi on of income, prices, etc. Computer information de rived from the use of the universal product code in conjunction with credit-card purchase as an individual household identifier could change this state of affairs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet available on a national or even a signif icant regional scale. To compensate for this data deficiency, an alternate i ndirect approach of analysis has been adopted known as economic shock tes ting. This method, widely used in the aircraft manufacturing industry, de velops an aggregate statistical sort of data. Applied to economics, this means th at all of the households in one region or in the whole na tion are studied as a group or class rather than individually, and the mass behavior ra ther than individual behavior is used to discover useful estimates of the technical coefficients governing the economic structure of the hypothetical single-house hold industry.... One method of evaluating the techni cal coefficients of the household industry depends upon s hocking the prices of a commodity and noting the changes in the sales of all of the commodities. ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING In recent times, the appl ication of Operations Re search to the study of the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles of shock testing. In the shock testing of an aircraft airframe, the recoil impulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe cause s shock waves in that structure which tell aviation engineers the conditions under which parts of the airplane or the whole airplane or its wi ngs will start to vi brate or flutter like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fork, and disintegra te or fall apart in flight."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 51 Economic engineers achieve the same result in studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gaso line, or sugar, and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability, thus kicking every- body's budget and buying habits out of shape. They then observe the shock wav es which result by monitoring the changes in advertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities. The objective of such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy into a predictable state of motion or change, even a con- trolled self-destructive state of motion which will convince the public that certain \"expert\" people should take control of the money system and reestablish security (rather than liber ty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are rendered unable to cont rol their financial affairs, they, of course, become totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor. Not only the prices of commodities, but also the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing. Labor strikes deliver excellent tails shocks to an economy, especially in the critical service areas of truck- ing (transportation), communication, pub lic utilities (energy, water, gar- bage collection), etc. By shock testing, it is found that there is a direct relationship between the availability of money flowing in an economy and the psychological outlook and response of masses of people dependent upon that availability. For example, there is a measurab le quantitative relationship between the price of gasoline and the probabil ity that a person would experience a headache, feel a need to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug of beer. It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economic modes by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from reality, and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Re- search, it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination of created events (shocks ) which will bring about a complete control and subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (by shaking the plum tree).... INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERS Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineer- ing. The basic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic) is that it receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an independent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable relationship to that input control signal. The simplest form of economic amp lifier is a device called advertising."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"52 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year- old, then, due to suggestibility, he w ill, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his economic reservoi r and deliver its energy to buy that product on impulse when he passes it in the store. An economic amplifier may have several inputs and outputs. Its response might be instantaneous or delayed. Its circuit symbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusiv e, qualitative, \"go\" or \"no go,\" or it might have its parametric input/output relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented. Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component. Economic Amplifiers fall into classes called strategies, and, in com- parison with electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economic amplifier are called logistical instead of electrical. Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also, in effect, are used to cause ch anges in the economic circuitry. In the design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least five functions, which are (1) the available input signals, (2) the desired output-control objectives, (3) the strategic objective, (4) the available economic power sources, (5) the logistical options. The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporat- ing the economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called GAME THEORY [WC emphasis]. The design of an economic amplifier begins with a specification of the power level of the output, which can range from personal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e., how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. High gain combined with strong feedback helps to deliver the required precision. Most of the error will be in the in put data signal. Personal input data tends to be specific, while national input data tends to be statistical.

(2) engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their in- dulgence in emotional and physical activities, by: (a) unrelenting emotional affrontati ons and attacks (mental and emo- tional rape) by way of a constant barra ge of sex, violence, and wars in the media — especially the T.V. and the newspapers. (b) giving them what they desire — in excess — \"junk food for thought\" — and depriving them of what they really need.

CONSENT, THE PRIMARY VICTORY A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available to silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service. (See Studies in the Structure of the American Economy for an"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper I.R.S. source list.) This information consists of the en forced delivery of well-organized data contained in federal and state tax forms collected, assembled, and submitted by slave labo r provided by taxpayers and employers. Furthermore, the number of such fo rms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator of public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other data sources are gi ven in the Short List of Inputs. Consent Coefficients — numerical feedback indi cating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compen sation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantif ied indicator of harvest time is the number of public c itizens who pay income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government. AMPLIFICATION ENERGY SOURCES The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discovering the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic system are, of cour se, a supply of ra w materials, and the consent of the people to labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level, or class in the social structure; i.e., to provide labor at various levels in the pecking order. Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income, controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure. This provides stability and security, but al so government from the top. As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class elements of th e social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to attain a knowledge of energy systems and the ability to enforce their rise thr ough the class structure. This threatens the sovereignty of the elite. If this rise of the lower classe s can be postponed long enough, the elite can achieve energy dominance, a nd LABOR BY CONSENT NO LONGER WILL HOLD A POSITION [WC emphasis] of an essential economic energy source. Until such energy dominance is absolu tely established, the consent of people to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration, since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final transfer of energy sour ces to the control of the elite. It is essential to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key to th e release of energy in the pr ocess of economic amplifica-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 59 tion. Therefore, consent as an energy release mechanism will now be con- sidered. LOGISTICS The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of inputs, outputs, the strate gy connecting the inputs and the ou tputs, and the available energy sources to fuel the st rategy. This study is called logistics. A logistical problem is studied at th e elementary level first, and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary fac- tors. This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., br oken down into its subsystems, and these in turn are an alyzed, until, by this process, one arrives at the logistical \"atom, \" THE INDIVIDUAL [WC emphasis]. This is where the process of SYNTHESIS [WC emphasis] properly begins, and at the time of th e birth of the individual. THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB From the time a person leaves its mo ther's womb, its every effort is directed toward building, maintaini ng, and withdrawing into artificial wombs, various sorts of substitu te protective devices or shells. The objective of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environ- ment for both stable and unstable ac tivity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes of growth and maturity — i.e., survival; to provide security for freedom and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity. This is equally true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite difference in the wa y each of these classes go about the solution of problems. THE POLITICAL STRUCTU RE OF A NATION — DEPENDENCY The primary reason why the individu al citizens of a country create a political structure is a subc onscious wish or desire to perp etuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their bruises, put a chicke n on every dinner table, clot he their bodies, tuck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright [sic] when they wake up in the morning. This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper meets incredibility with incredibility by promisin g the world and deliver- ing nothing. So who is the bigger liar? the publ ic? or the \"godfather\"? This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expedien- cy. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategi c weapon, useful against a disgusting public. ACTION/OFFENSE Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might raise. Therefore, they assign th e dirty work to others (including their own children) so as to keep th e blood off their ow n hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughter house down the street and out of sight. But even mo re hypocritical, they pay taxes to fina nce a professional association of hit men collectively ca lled politicians, an d then complain about corruption in government. RESPONSIBILITY Again, most people want to be free to do things (to explore, etc.) but they are afraid to fail. The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility, a nd especially in delegating those personal re sponsibilities to others where success is uncer- tain or carries po ssible or created li abilities (law) which the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word — \"author\"), but they will not accept responsibility or liabilit y. So they hire politicians to face reality for them. SUMMARY The people hire the politician s so that the people can: (1) obtain security without managing it. (2) obtain action without thinking about it. (3) inflict theft, injury, and death upo n others without having to con- template either life or death. (4) avoid responsibility for their own intentions. (5) obtain the benefits of re ality and science withou t exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or learning either of these things. They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 61 (1) provide for the survival of the NATION/WOMB. (2) prevent encroachment of anything upon the NATION/WOMB. (3) destroy the enemy who threatens the NATION /WOMB. (4) destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the NATION/WOMB. Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and the C.P.A.S next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout the orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The \"presidential\" level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite. Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a DOC- ILE SUB-NATION [great silent majo rity] and a POLITICAL SUB-NATION. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself an d then devour its parent. SYSTEM ANALYSIS In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structure — personnel and material alike. This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsys- terms of such a structure. THE DRAFT (As military service) Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio- military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. [WC Note: The truth is just the opposite, as government exists only with the consent of the people.] He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bul let can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for ei ghteen years of hi s life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere mont hs. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"62 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH A YOUNG MAN'S PARENTS, WHO PURPORTEDLY LOVE HIM, CAN BE INDUCED TO SEND HIM OFF TO WA R TO HIS DEATH [WC emphasis]. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matte r to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems. We begin with a tentative definitio n of the draft. THE DRAFT (selec- tive service, etc.) is an institution of COMPULSO RY collective SACRIFICE and SLAVERY, devised by the middle-aged and the elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work . It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabil izer). It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of \"patriotic = na tional\" service. Once a candid economic definition of th e draft is achieved, that defini- tion is used to outline the boundaries of a stru cture called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is give n in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc. Some of these categories are ordina ry and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: th e value of a mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years. Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) ca n be devised, if not to predict, at least to predetermine these events with maximum certainty. What does not exist by natural coop eration is thus enhanced by calculated compul- sion. Human beings are machines, le vers which may be grasped and turned, and there is littl e real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory. These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer an alysis.) These values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars , since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to give the economy a false kine tic energy (\"pape r\" inductance)."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Chapter One Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars • 63 The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as c ould be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes sl ightly due to changes in production technology. ENFORCEMENT FACTOR I As in every social system appr oach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction pat- terns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous. As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsys- terms. To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control. FACTOR II— FATHER The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes. The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior. By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstand- FACTOR III — MOTHER The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to \"reality\" when it comes, or sooner."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"64 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper As the transition becomes more di fficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachme nt of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). CAUTION: A woman's impul- sive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must like- wise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920. FACTOR IV — JUNIOR The emotional pressure for self-preservation during time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield — if junior can be pers uaded to go — is all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: \"No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends/' FACTOR V —SISTER And what about junior's sister? She is given all the good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless of the price. FACTOR VI — CATTLE Those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless sc hool of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same.

That last sentence is the real reason why people choose to ignore \"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.\" People are not ready to admit that they have been cattle.

Accounts of elders or priests who guarded the forbidden knowledge of ancien t peoples. Prom inent men, meeting in secret, who dir ected the course of civilization are recorded in the writings of all people. The oldest is the Brotherhood of the Snake, also called the Brotherhood of the Dragon, and it s till exists under many different names. The Brother- hood of the Snake is devoted to guardi ng the \"secrets of the ages\" and to the recognition of Lucifer as the one and only true God. If you do not believe in God, Lucifer, or Satan, you must understand th at there are great masses of people who do. I do not believe in racism but millions do and their beliefs and actions ba sed upon those beliefs will affect me. It is clear that religion has always played a significant role in the course of these organizations. Communication with a higher source, often divine, is a familiar claim in all but a few. The secrets of these groups are thou ght to be so profound that only a chosen, well-educated few are able to understand and use them. These men use their special knowledge for th e benefit of all mankind. At least that is what they clai m. How are we to know, since their knowledge and actions have been secret? Fortunatel y, some of it has become public know- ledge. I found it intriguing that in most, if not all, primitive tribal societies all of the adults are members. They are usually separated into male and female groups. The male usually domin ates the culture. Surprisingly, this exactly resembles many civi lized secret societies. Th is can only mean that the society is working not against esta blished authority, but for it. In fact, could be said to actually be the esta blished authority. This would tend to remove the validity of a ny argument that all secret associations are dedi- cated to the \"destruction of properly constituted authority.\" This can only apply, of course, where the secret soci ety makes up the majority or entirety of any people which it affects. Only a very few fall into this category. Secret societies in fact mirror many facets of ordinary life. There is always an exclusivity of membershi p, with the resultant importance at- tached to being or becoming a member. This is found in all human en- deavors, even those which are not secret , such as football teams or country clubs. This exclusivity of membership is actually one of the secret societies' most powerful weapons. There is the use of signs, passwords and other tools. These have always performed valuable func tions in man's organiza- tions everywhere. The stated reason, al most always differe nt from the real reason, for the societies' existence is important. It can be anything, but is usually fraternal and is found in all pressure groups wherever people congregate."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 69 The comradeship is especially important. Sharing hardships or secrets has always been a special th rill to man. No one who has ever undergone the rigors of boot camp is ever likely to forget the special feeling of belonging and comradeship that w as shared between the victims of the drill sergeant or company commander. It is an emotion born of initiation. The most potent tool of any secret society is the ritual and myth surround- ing initiation. These special binding ceremonies have very deep meaning for the participants. Initiation performs several functions which make up the heart and soul of any true secret society. Like boot camp, the initiation into the armed forces, important aspects of human thought that are universally compell- ing, are merged to train and maintain the efforts of a group of people to operate in a certain direction. Initia tion bonds the members together in mysticism Neophytes gain knowledge of a secr et, giving them special status. The ancient meaning of neophyte is \"planted anew or reborn.\" A higher initiation is in reality a promotion inspiring loyalty and the desire to move up to the next rung. The goals of the society are reinforced, causing the initiated to act toward those goals in everyday life. That brings about a change in the political and social action of the member. The change is always in the best interest of the goa ls of the leaders of the secret society. The leaders are called adepts. This can best be illustrated by the soldier trained to follow orders without thinking. The result is often the wound- ing or death of the soldier for the realization of the commander's goal, which may or may not be good for the overall community. Initiation is a means of rewarding am bitious men who can be trusted. You will notice that the higher the de gree of initiation the fewer the mem- bers who possess the degree. This is not because the other members are not ambitious but because a process of very careful selection is being con- ducted. A point is reached where no effort is good enough without a pull up by the higher members. Most members never proceed beyond this point and never learn the real, secret purpose of the group. The frozen member from that point on serves only as a part of the political power base, as indeed he has always done. You may have guessed by now that initia- tion is a way to determine w ho can and cannot be trusted. A method of deciding exactly who is to become an adept may be decided during initiation by asking the candidate to spit upon the Chris- tian cross. If the candidate refuses, the members congratulate him and tell him, \"You have made the right choice, as a true adept would never do such a terrible thing.\" The newly initiated might find it disconcerting, however, that he/she never advances any higher . If instead, the candidate spits"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"70 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper upon the cross, he/she has demonstrat ed a knowledge of one of the mys- teries and soon will find him/herself a candidate for the next higher level. The mystery is that religion is but a tool to control th e masses. Knowledge (or wisdom) is their only god, thro ugh which man hims elf will become god. The snake and the dragon are both symbols of wisdom. Lucifer is the personification of the symbol. It wa s Lucifer who temp ted Eve to entice Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge and thus fr ee man from the bonds of ignorance. The WORSHIP (a lot di fferent from STUDY) of knowledge, science, or technology is Satanism in its purest form, and its god is Lucifer. Its secret symbol is the a ll-seeing eye in the pyramid. Undesirable effects of secret socie ties and their aura of mystery has sometimes given them the reputation for being abnormal associations or, at the very least, strange groups of pe ople. Whenever their beliefs are those of the majority they are no longer co nsidered antisocial. A good example is the Christian church, which was at one time a secret society under the Roman Empire. In fact, the \"Open Frie ndly Secret Society\" (the Vatican) actually ruled most, if not all, of the known wo rld at one time. Most secret societies are generally co nsidered to be antisocial; they are believed to contain elements that are not liked or are outright harmful to the community in general. This is exactly the case in some instances. Communism and fascism are secret soci eties in many countries where they are prohibited by law. In this countr y the Nazi party and the Ku Klux Klan are secret societies due mostly to the fact that the general public is dis- gusted by them. Their activ ities are sometime s illegal, thus the secrecy of their membership. The early Christians were a secret society because Roman authorities considered them from the start to be dangerous to imperial rule. The same was true of th e followers of Islam. At least some of these true believers, working in secret, acco mplished what would turn out to be for the eventual good of society. The Druseed and Yezidis in Syria and Iraq consider the Arabs a dangerous secret society dedicated to the takeover of the world. The Arabs toda y think the same of the Jews. Cath- olics and Freemasons used to have precisely the same ideas about each other. In many primitive or backward soci eties initiation into the highest degrees of the group involved subjectio n to trials which not infrequently resulted in death or insanity for the ca ndidate. It can be seen that social right and wrong is not the yardstick in estimating the value of a secret society. In Borneo, initiates of hunti ng societies, consider it meritorious and compulsory to hunt he ads. In Polynesia, infanticide and debauch were considered essential for in itiation into their societie s, where the tribal code needed members who indulged in th ese things, as pillars of society."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 71 Since the beginning of recorded history, governmental bodies of every nation have been involved with main taining the status quo to defend the establishment against minority groups that sought to function as states within states or to oust the constitute d authority and take over in its place. Many of these attempts have succee ded but have not always lasted. Man's desire to be one of the elect is something that no power on earth has been able to lessen, let alone destroy. It is one of the \"secrets\" of secret societies. It is what gives them a po litical base and lots of clout. Members often vote the same and give each other preference in daily business, legal, and social activities. It is the deepest d esire of many to be able to say, \"I belong to the elect.\" Houses of worship and sacrifice existed in the ancient cities. They were in fact temples built in honor of the many gods. These buildings functioned often as meeting places for philosophers and mystics who were believed to possess the secrets of nature. These men usually banded to- gether in seclusive philosophic and religious schools. The most important of all of these ancient groups is the Brotherhood of the Snake, or Dragon, and was simply known as the Mysteries. The snake and dragon are symbols that represent wisdom. The father of wis- dom is Lucifer, also called the Light Bearer. The focus of worship for the Mysteries was Osiris, another name of Lucifer. Osiris was the name of a bright star that the ancients belie ved had been cast down onto the earth. The literal meaning of Lucifer is \"bringe r of light\" or \"the morning star.\" After Osiris was gone from the sky, th e ancients saw the Sun as the repre- sentation of Osiris, or more correctly, Lucifer. Osiris was represented by the sun. Albert Pike How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer...

Some of the most famous were known as Osiris, Isis, Sabazius, Cybele, and Eleusis.

Plato's initiation encompassed three days of entombment in the Great Pyramid, during which time he died (s ymbolically), was reborn, and was given secrets that he was to preserve. Plato's writings are full of informa- tion on the Mysteries. Manly P. Hall st ated in his book, Th e Secret Teachings of All Ages that, \"...the illumined of antiquity...entered its [pyramid of Giza] portals as men; they came forth as gods.\" The ancient Egyptian word for pyramid was khuti, which meant \"gloriou s light.\" Mr. Hall says also, \"The pyramids, the great Egyptian temples of initiation...\" According to many, the great pyr amids were built to commemorate and observe a supernova e xplosion that occurred in the year 4000 B.C. Dr. Anthony Hewish, 1974 Nobel Prize winner in physics, discovered a rhyth- mic series of radio pulses which he proved were emissions from a star that had exploded around 4000 B.C. The Fr eemasons begin thei r calendar from A.L., \"In the Year of Light,\" found by adding 4000 to the modern year. Thus 1990 + 4000 = 5 990 A.L. George Michanowsk y wrote in The Once and Future Star that \"The ancient Sumeri an cuneiform...described a giant star exploding within a triangle formed by. ..Zeta Puppis, Gamma Velorum, and Lambda Velorum...located in the southern sky....[An] accurate star catalogue now stated that the blazing star that had exploded within the triangle would again be seen by man in 6000 years.\" According to the Freemason's calendar it will occur in the year 2000, and indeed it will. The spacecraft called Galileo is on its way to Jupiter, a baby star with a gaseous makeup exactly the same as our sun, with a load of 49.7 pounds of plutonium, supposedly being used as ba tteries to power the craft. When its final orbit decays in December 199 9, Galileo will deliver its payload into the center of Jupiter. The unbelievabl e pressure that w ill be encountered will cause a reaction exactly as occurs when an atomic bomb is exploded by an implosion detonator. The plutonium will explode in an atomic reaction, lighting the hydrogen and helium atmosphere of Jupiter and resulting in the birth of the star that has alread y been named LUCIFER. The world will interpret it as a sign of tremendous religious significance. It will fulfill prophecy. In reality it is only a demonstration of th e insane application of technology by the JASON Society whic h may or may not even work. They have practiced overkill to ensure success, however, as the documents that I read while in Naval Intelligence stat ed that Project GALILEO required only five pounds of plutonium to ignite Jupiter and possibly stave off the coming ice age.

The temperate zones where food can be grown are shrinking. Desertification is increasing in the trop- ics. An ice age is on its way, and it will occur suddenly. Simultaneously a vault containing th e ancient records of the earth will be opened in Egypt. The return of Luci fer and the opening of the vault will usher in the millennium. A great celebration has already been planned by the Millennium Society to take place at the pyramids in Egypt. According to the January 3,1989, edition of the Arizona Daily Star, \"President-elect Bush is spending this New Year's ho liday at Camp David, Maryland, but In 10 years he may be in Egypt. Organizers of the Millennium Society say he's already committed to ushering in the next century at the Great Pyra- mid of Cheops in Giza.\" The first secret that one must know to even begin to understand the Mysteries is that their members believe that there are but few truly mature minds in the world. They believe that those minds belong exclusively to them. The philosophy that follows is the classic secret-society view of humanity. \"When a person of strong intellect is confronted with a problem which calls for the use of reasoning faculties, they keep their poise and attempt to reach a solution by garnering facts bearing upon the question. On the other hand, those who are imma ture, when confronted by the same problem, are overwhelmed. While the fo rmer may be said to be qualified to solve the mystery of their own destiny, the latter must be led like a bunch of animals and taught in the simplest language. Like sheep they are totally dependent upon the shepherd. The able intellect is taught the Mysteries and the esoteric spiritual truths. The masses are taught the literal, exoteric interpretations. While the masses wors hip the five senses, the select few observe, recognizing in the gulf between them the symbolic concretions of great abstract truths. \"The initiated elect communicate directly to Gods [ALIENS?] who communicate back to them. The masses sacrifice their lambs on an altar facing, a stone idol that can neither hear or speak. The elect are given knowledge of the Mysteries and are illumined and are thus known as The Illuminati or the Illuminated Ones, the guardians of the 'Secrets of the Ages.'\" Three early secret societies that can be directly connected to a modern descendant are the cults of Roshaniya, Mithras and their counterpart, the Builders. They have many things in common with the Freemasons of today as well as with many other branches of the Illuminati. For instance, common to the Brotherhood are the symbolic rebirth into a new life with- out going through the portal of death during initiation; reference to the \"Lion\" and \"the Grip of the Lion's Paw\" in the Master Mason's degree; the"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"74 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper three degrees, which is the same as the ancient Masonic rites before the many other degrees were added; the la dder of seven rungs; men only; and the \"all-seeing eye.\" Of special interest is the powerful society in Afghanistan in ancient times called the Roshaniya — illuminated ones. There are actually refer- ences to this mystical cult going back through history to the House of Wisdom at Cairo. The major tenets of this cult were: the abolition of private property; the elimination of religion; the elimination of nation states; the belief that illumination emanated from the Supreme Being who desired a class of perfect men and wome n to carry out the organization and direction of the world; belief in a plan to reshape the social system of the world by first taking control of in dividual countries one by one, and the belief that after reaching the fourth degree one could communicate directly with the unknown supervisors who ha d imparted knowledge to initiates throughout the ages. Wise men will again recognize the Brotherhood. Can you hear the echo of the Nazi party, the Communist party, the extreme right and the extreme left? The important fact to remember is that the leaders of both the right and the left are a small, hard core of men who have been and still are Illuminists or members of the Brotherhood. They may have been or may be members of the Christian or Jewish religions, but that is only to further their own ends. They are and always have been Luciferian and internationalist. They give allegiance to no particular na- tion, although they have used, on occasion, nationalism to further their causes. Their only concern is to gain greater economic and political power. The ultimate objective of the leaders of both groups is identical. They are determined to win for themselves undisputed control of the wealth, nat- ural resources, and manpower of the entire planet. They intend to turn the world into their conception of a Luciferi an totalitarian socialist state. In the process they will eliminate all Christians, Jews, and atheists. You have just learned one, but only one, of the great mysteries. The Roshaniya also called themselves the Order. Initiates took an oath that absolved them of all allegiance ex cept to the Order and stated, \"I bind myself to perpetual silence and unsh aken loyalty and submission to the Order....All humanity which cannot identify itself by our secret sign is our lawful prey.\" The oath remains essentia lly the same to this day. The secret sign was to pass a hand over the forehead, palm inward; the countersign, to hold the ear with the fingers and support the elbow in the cupped other hand. Does that sound familiar? The Order is the Order of the Quest. The cult preached that there was no heaven , no hell, only a spirit state com- pletely different from life as we know it. The spirit could continue to be powerful on earth through a member of the Order, but only if the spirit had"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 75 been itself a member of the Order be fore its death. Thus members of the Order gained power from the spirits of the dead members. The Roshaniya took in travelers as initiates and then sent them on their way to found new chapters of the Order. It is believed by some that the Assassins were a branch of the Ro shaniya. Branches of the Roshaniya or \"the illuminated ones\" or the Illu minati existed and still exist every- where. One of the rules was not to use the same name and never mention \"the Illuminati.\" That rule is still in effect today. I believe that it is the breaking of this rule that result ed in Adam Weishaupt's downfall. One of the greatest secrets of the ag es is the true story of the Holy Grail, the robe of Jesus, the remains of the Cross of Cr ucifixion, and whe- ther Jesus actually died or if he survived and produced a child. Many myths surround the Knights Templar concerning these relics, and most myths throughout history always have at least some basis in fact. If my sources are correct, the Knights Templa r survive today as a branch of the Illuminati and guard the re lics, which are hidden in a location known only to them. We know that the Templars are Illuminati because the Freemasons absorbed and protected those that escaped persecution of the church and France, just as the Freemasons w ould absorb and protect Weishaupfs Illuminati centuries later. The Knights Templar exist today as a higher degreve of Freemasonry within the Templar Order. In fact, the Knights Templar is a branch of the Order of the Quest. The DeMolay Society is a branch of the Freemasons that cons ecrates the memory of the persecution of the Knights Templar a nd in particular, their le ader Jacques deMolay. I know, because I was a member of the DeMolay Society as a young adult. I loved the mystery and ritual. I beca me separated from the Society when my family moved to a location out of reach of any lodge. I believe to this day that my association with the DeMolay Society may have been the reason for my selection for Naval Security and Intelligence. According to members of the inte lligence community, when the New World Order is solidified the relics will be taken out, will be united with the Spear of Destiny, and will, according to legend, give the world's ruler absolute power. This may confirm beliefs passed down through the ages that describe the significance of thes e relics when united in the hands of one man. It may also explain Hitler 's desperate search for their hiding place during World War II. Again I must remind you that it makes not one iota of difference what you believe. If they believe, you will be affected.

The Prieure de Sion was a religi ous order founded upon Mount Sion in Jerusalem. The Order set for itself the goal of preserving and recording the bloodline of Jesus and the Hous e of David. Through every means available to them, the Prieure de Sion had found and retrieved the remain- ing relics. These relics were entrusted to the Knights Templar for safekeep- ing. I am amazed at the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail and the information that they have unearthe d. Most of all I am amazed at their inability to put the puzzle together. The treasure hidden in France is not the treasure of the Temple of Jerusalem. It is the Holy Grail itself, the robe of Jesus, the last remain ing pieces of th e Cross of Crucifixion, and, accord- ing to my sources, someone's bones. I can tell you that the reality of the bones will shake the world to its very foundations if I have been told the truth. The relics are hidden in Fran ce. I know the location and so do the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but they do not know that they know — or do they? Adam Weishaupt, a young professor of canon law at Ingolstadt Uni- versity in Germany, was a Jesuit priest and an initiate of the Illuminati. The branch of the Order he founded in Germany in 1776 was the same Il- luminati previously discussed. The Je suit connection is important, as you will see later in this chapter. Researchers agree that he was financed by the House of Rothschild (the same Roth schild family mentioned in \"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\"). Weishaupt advocated \"aboliti on of all ordered national governments, abolit ion of inheritance, abol ition of private proper- ty, abolition of patr iotism, abolition of the indi vidual home and family life as the cell from which al l civilizations have stem med, and abolition of all religions established and existing so th at the Luciferian ideology of totali- tarianism may be imposed on mankind.\" In the same year that he founded th e Illuminati he published Wealth of Nations, the book that provided the ideological foundation for capitalism and for the Industrial Revol ution. It is no accident that the Declaration of Independence was written in the same year. On the obverse of the Great Seal of the United States the wise will recognize the all-seeing eye and other signs of the Brotherhood of the Snake. Every tenet was the same . Date and beliefs conf irm that Weishaupt's Illuminati is the same as the Afghan Illuminated Ones and the other cults which called themselves \"illuminated.\" The Alumbrados of Spain were the same as were the \"illuminated\" Guerinets of France. In the United States they were known as the Jacobin clubs. Secret s within secr ets within secrets — but always at th e heart is the Brotherhood. I believe that Weishaupt was betrayed and set up for persecution"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 77 because he ignored the rule that the wo rd \"illuminati\" or the existence of the Brotherhood would never be exposed to public knowledge. His ex- posure and outlawing accomplished sever al goals of the still-hidden and still very powerful brotherhood. It a llowed members to debunk claims of its existence on the grounds that th e Illuminati had been exposed and outlawed and thus was no longer a rea lity. It allowed members to deny allegations of conspiracy of any kind. The Brotherhood of the Snake is adept at throwing out decoys to keep the dogs at bay. Weishaupt may have been a fool — or he may have been doing exactly what he was told. Weishaupt said, \"The great strength of our Order lies in its conceal- ment; let it never appear in its own name, but always covered by another name, and another occupation.\" Allegations that the Freemason orga nizations were infiltrated by the Illuminati during Weishaupt's rei gn are hogwash. The Freemasons have always contained the core of Illumina ti within their ranks, and that is why they so freely and so willingly took in and hid the members of Weishaupt's group. You cannot really believe that the Freemasons, if they were only a simple fraternal organization, would have risked everything, including their very lives, by taking in and hi ding outlaws who had been condemned by the monarchies of Europe. It is mainly Freemason authors who have perpetuated the myth that Adam We ishaupt was the founder of the Il- luminati and that the Illuminati was destroyed, never to surface again. In 1826 an American Freemason wrote a book revealing Masonic secrets entitled Illustrations of Freemaso nry. One of the secrets that he revealed is that the last mystery at the top of the Masonic pyramid is the worship of Lucifer. We have since learned the secret of the \"story of the murder of Hiram Abif.\" Hiram Abif represents intelligence, liberty and truth, and was struck down by a blow to the neck with a rule, representing the suppression of speech by the church; then he was struck in the heart wih the square, representing the suppression of belief by the State; and finally he was struck on the head by a maul, representing the suppression of intellect by the masses. Freemasonry thus equates the Church, the State, and masses with tyranny, intolera nce, and ignorance. What Morgan revealed was that the Freemasons were pledged to avenge Hiram Abif and that their plan was to strike down the Church, the State, and the freedom of the masses. Morgan caused a small uproar against the Masons. The small uproar turned into a full blown anti-Freem ason movement when the author, Wil- liam Morgan, disappeared. Morgan had apparently been abducted and drowned in Lake Ontario. It was alle ged that fellow Masons had done it, a claim that they deny to this day. Who else would have done it? I believe"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"78 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper they murdered him. The newspapers of the time state without reservation that he was murdered by Masons. The oath of initiation into the Free- masons states that if secrets are told, the initiate will be murdered. A nationwide furor ensu ed that resulted in the cr eation of an anti-Masonic political party in 1829 by Henry Dana Ward, Thurlow Weed, and William H. Seward. Interest in several anti-Ma sonic books was revi ved during that period, with the result that Freemason ry suffered a severe loss of member- ship. It lasted only a few years and by 1840 the anti-Masonic party was extinct. Time really does cure all ills. We know that the British Freemasons are a totally se lf-serving group that discriminates in favor of its own whenever jobs, promotions, contracts, or careers are concerned. The English Freemason organization was used by the KGB to infiltrate and take over British Inte lligence. British Intel- ligence is synonomous with Chatha m House, more commonly known as the Royal Institute for International A ffairs, the parent organization of the Council on Foreign Relations in the Unite d States. The English state police, Scotland Yard, ordered its personnel not to join the Masons for fear the same would happen to them. Of course, you have been told all your life that the Freemasons are only a benevole nt fraternal organi zation bent only on community service. Read on, O innocent one. Probably the most notorious Freemason lodge is the P2 lodge in Italy. This group has been implicated in everything from bribery to assassina- tions. P2 is directly connected to the Vatican, the Knights of Malta, and to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It is powerful and dangerous. The P2 lodge has succeeded in inf iltrating the Vatican and has scored a coup of tremendous significance: the Pope, John Paul II, ha s lifted the ban against Freemasonry. Many high-level member s of the Vatican are now Free- masons. I tell you now that Freemasonry is on e of the most wicked and terrible organizations upon this earth. The Maso ns are major players in the strug- gle for world domination. The 33rd Degree is split into two. One split contains the core of the Luciferian Illuminati and the other contains those who have no knowledge of it whatsoever. ALL of the intelligence officers that I worked for while in Naval Intelligence were Masons. As I stated before, I belie ve that my association with the DeMolay Society as a young adult may have been the reason that I was selected for Naval Security and In telligence.

I say fortunately, because th ey confirm my previous allegation that I published in my paper \"The Secret Government\" that the CIA had plants, called moles, deep within the Vatican. I do not wish to be called a plagiarist so you MUST READ Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Messianic Legacy, both by Baigent, Leigh, & Lincoln. Any reputable bookstore should carry them. Between pages 343 and 361 of The Messianic Legacy you can read of the alliance of power that resulted in a secret world government. Most members of the Freemasons are not aware that the Illuminati practices what is known as \"secrets with in secrets,\" or organizations within organizations. That is one purpose of initiation. I cannot excuse any of the members, however, for anyone who joins a society without knowing EVERYTHING about the organization is indeed a fool. Only those at the top who have passed every test truly know what the Masons are hiding, thus rendering it impossible for anyone outside to know much at all about the group. What does that say about new members or those who are already members but do not know the ultimate secrets? It tells me that fools abound. Unlike authors who out of fear have acted as apologists for the Freemasons, I decline to absolve them of responsibility and guilt. The freemasons, like everyone else, are r esponsible for the cleanliness of their home. The occupant of a secret house within a secret house within a secret house cannot clean if he cannot see the number of rooms or what they contain. Their house is a stinking cesspool. Look to the Masons for the guilty party if anything happens to me. I believe that they have murdered In the past and that they will murder in the future. I firmly believe that all adult secret societies that practice degrees of initiation and consider the members to be \"illuminated\" are branches of the original ages-old Illuminati. Their goal is to rule the world. The doctrine of this group is not democracy or communism, but is a form of fascism. The doctrine is totalitarian socialism. You must begin to think correctly. The Illuminati are not Communists, but some Communists are Illuminati. (1) Monarchism (thesis) faced democracy (antithesis) in WWI, which resul- ted in the formation of communism and the League of Nations (synthesis). (2) Democracy and communism (thesis) faced fascism (antithesis) in WWII and resulted in a more powerful United Nations (synthesis). (3) Capi- talism (thesis) now faces communism (antithesis) and the result will be the New World Order, totalitarian socialism (synthesis). The 1953 report of the California Senate Investigating Committee on Education stated: \"So-called modern Communism is apparently the same hypocritical world conspiracy to destroy civilization that was founded by the Illuminati, and that raised its head in our colonies here at the critical period before the adoption of our Co nstitution.\" The California Senate"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"80 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper understood that communism is the work of the Illuminati.

The enemy is not communism, it is Illuminism. The Commun ists are not going to be much happier with the New World Order than we. I hope to show that mo st modern secret societ ies and especially those that practice degrees of initiation — a nd that is the key — are really one society with one purpose. You may call them whatever you wish — the Order of the Quest, the JASON Societ y, the Roshaniya, the Qabbalah, the Knights Templar, the Knights of Ma lta, the Knights of Columbus, the Jesuits, the Masons, the Ancient and Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis, the Illuminati, the Nazi Party, the Commu nist Party, the Executive Members of the Council on Foreign Relations, The Group, the Brotherhood of the Dragon, the Rosicrucians, the Royal Institute of In ternational Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Open Friendly Secret Society (the Vatican), the Russell Trust, the Skull & Bones, the Scroll & Key, the Order — they are all the same and all work toward th e same ultimate goal, a New World Order. Many of them, however, disagree on exactly who will rule this New World Order, and that is what cause s them to sometime s pull in opposite directions while nevert heless proceeding toward the same goal. The Vatican, for instance, wants the Pope to head the world coalition. Some want Lord Maitreya to head the New World Order. Lord Maitreya is the front runner, I believe, since witnesses say he was present on the ship at Malta with Bush, Gorbachev, and the ten regional heads of the New World Order. ''Approximately 200 dignitaries from around the world attended a major conference initiated by Maitreya in London on April 21 and 22, 1990. Representatives of gove rnments (including the USA), members of royal families, religious leaders and journalists, all of whom had met with Maitreya previously, attended the co nference.\" Quote from \"Prophecy Watch\" column of Whole Wheat No. 8, Minneapolis. Someone has also spent an awful lot of money announcing his pres- ence. The Pope will have to approve hi m if Maitreya is selected, however, and that would fulfill the Bible prophec y in the Book of Revelation that states that the first beast will be given his power by Rome. If you can interpret Revelation as I can, then you know that the Pope will ultimately win out and will reign as the second beast. In 1952 an alliance was formed, bringing them all together for the first time in history.

I will undoubtedly become a target when this book is published. You may notice that some of those listed in the preceding paragraphs do not, or so it appears, practice degrees of initiation. That is the public view. Look at the Council on Foreign Relations. Many members—in fact, the majority — never serve on the executive committees. They never go through any initiation of any kind. They are, in fact, the power base and are used to gain a consensus of opini on. The majority are not really members but are made to feel as if they are. In reality they are being used and are unwilling or unable to understand. The Executive Committee is an inner core of intimate associates, members of a secret society called the Order of the Quest, also known as the JASON Society, devoted to a com- mon purpose. The members are an outer circle on whom the inner core acts by personal persuasion, patronage and social pressure. That is how they bought Henry Kissinger. Rockefeller gave Kissinger a grant of $50,000 in the early '50s, a fortune in those days, and made dear old Henry a member of the CFR. Anyone in the outer circle who does not toe the mark is summarily expelled and the lesson is not lost on those who remain. Do you remember the human desire to be a member of the elect? That is the principle at work. The real power are men who are always recruited without exception from the secret societie s of Harvard and Yale known as the Skull & Bones and the Scroll & Key. Both socie ties are secret branches (also called the Brotherhood of Death) of what is otherwise historically known as the Illuminati. They are connected to parent organizations in England (The Group of Oxford University and especially All Souls College), and Ger- many (the Thule Society, also called the Brotherhood of Death). I learned this when I was with Naval Intelligen ce. I was not able to explain why some members of the Executive Committee were not listed under the \"Addresses\" of Chapter 322 of the Skull & Bones Society until I read The Wise Men by Walter Isaacson & Evan Thomas, Simon and Schuster, New York. Under illustration #9 in the center of the book you will find the caption \"Lovett with the Yale Unit, above far right, and on the beach: His initiation into Skull and Bones came at an air base near Dunkirk.\" I have found that members of these two societies were chosen on an ongoing basis by invitation based upon merit post-colle ge and were not confined to only Harvard orY>ale attendees.

George Bush is a member of the Order. Surprised? You shouldn't be. His father was also a member who help ed finance Hitler. It is important that you know that the members of th e Order take an oath that absolves them from any allegiance to any nation or king or government or constitution, and that includes the negating of any sub- sequent oath of allegiance which they may be requir ed to take. They swear allegiance only to the Order and its goal of a New World Order. George Bush is not a loyal citizen of the United States but instead is loyal only to the destruction of the United States and to the formation of the New World Order. According to the oath Bush took when he was initiated into Skull & Bones, his oath of office as President of the United States of America means nothing. The Trilateral Commission is an el ite group of some 300 very promi- nent business, political , and intellectual decision-makers of Western Europe, North America, and Japan. This enterprise is a private agency that works to build up political and econo mic cooperation among the three regions. Its grand design, which it no longer hides, is a New World Order. The Trilateral Commission was the id ea of its founder, American banking magnate David Rock efeller. The real reason for its formation was the decline of the Council on Foreign Relation's power as a result of the people's dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War. Th e reasoning behind the move toward the Trilateral Commissi on was the same as entering two horses in the same race. It doubles the chances of winning. The real power has always remained solidly in the hands of the Council on Foreign Rela- tions. The Rockefeller family was, is and always will be the benefactor of both organizations. Rockefe ller, though powerf ul, is not in control in this country or anywhere else. The key to the REAL power is the fact that Rockefeller had to put out feelers at a Bilderberg Grou p meeting in 1972 about forming a private gr oup of trilateral leader s. The Bilderberg Group gave the nod and Rockef eller's man Zbigniew Br zezinski gathered up a membership and organized the Trilat eral Commission in 1972, not in 1973 as the Commission claims. A key to the danger presented by the Trilateral Commission is its \"Seminal Peace,\" written for them by Harvard Prof essor Samuel P. Hun- tington in the mid '70s. In the pape r Professor Huntington recommended that democracy and economic development be discarded as outdated ideas. He wrote as co-author of the book Crises In Democracy, \"We have come to recognize that there are pote ntial desirable limits to economic growth. There are also potentially desira ble limits to the indefinite exten- sion of political democracy. A governme nt which lacks auth ority will have little ability short of cataclysmic crisis to impose on its people the sacrifices"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 83 which may be necessary.\" The crises and sacrifices he talks about will be discussed in a later chapter. Remember that George Bush was a member of the Trilateral Commis- sion and only resigned as an expediency to get elected. He believes whole- heartedly in the Commission and its ideas and ideals. We have elected a President who believes that democracy and economic development must be discarded. I tell you now that he is working toward that end. Bush is still a member of the Order and the CFR. The JASON Society, or JASON Scholars, takes its name from the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece, and it is a branch of the Order of the Quest, One of the highest degrees in the Illu minati. The golden fleece takes on the role of truth to JASON members. Jas on represents the search for the truth. Therefore the name JASON Society denotes a group of men who are engaged in a search for the truth. Th e name Jason is spelled with capital letters when used as the name of th e JASON Society. Lower-case letters are never used when referring to this secret group. Author's note: The name may even have a deeper meaning, as the name \"Jason\" and the Golden Fleece appear th roughout history in relation to vari- ous other secret societies. In these instances the story represents man (Jason) looking for himself (Golden Fleece). Top Secret documents that I read while with Naval Intelligence stated that President Eisenhower had commissioned the JASON Society to ex- amine all of the evidence, facts, lies, and deception and find the truth of the alien question. Founders of the JASON Group (not the same as the JASON Society) include members of the famous Manhattan Project, which brought together almost every leading physici st in the nation to build the atomic bomb during World War II. The group is made up mostly of theoretical physicists and is the most elite gath ering of scientific minds in the United States. As of 1987 the membership included four Nobel Prize winners. Today JASON continues to offer scientific help the government cannot find anywhere else. They are probably the only group of scientists in the United States that know the true state of highest technology. JASON is shrouded in what appears to be unnecessary secrecy. The group refuses to release its membership list. None of the members list JASON membership on their official resumes. Working completely behind the scenes, JASON has guided the natio n's most important security deci- sions. These include, but are not limited to, Star Wars, submarine warfare, and predictions about the greenhouse effect. The JA SON members are each paid a $500-per-day consultant's fee. In the documents that I read while with Naval Intelligence the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"84 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper JASONS predicted that the greenhouse effect would lead ultimately to an ICE AGE. According to the Pentagon, the JASO NS hold the highest and most restrictive security clearances in the nation. They are given the protocol rank of rear admiral (two stars) when they visit or travel aboard ships or visit military bases. The only other reference to the JASON group that I have been able to find is in The Pentagon Papers. The papers stated that JASON was responsible fo r designing the electronic barrier between North and South Vietnam for the purpose of sealing off infiltration of the South by North Vietnamese regulars during the Vietnam War. I was stationed on the DMZ and I can tell you that it did not work. The veil of secrecy dr awn around the JASON Group has been so tight and so leak-proof since its conception that thos e who think the government cannot keep a secret need to reexamine that po sition. The government was able to contain the JASON secret ex cept for the one leak; but the JASON Group itself, a civilian gr oup, did even better. No le aks have ever occurred from within JASON. JASON is admini stered by the M itre Corporation. Government contracts allotted to the Mitre Corporation are in reality al- lotted to the JASON scient ists. This is done so th at the name JASON does not ever appear in documents whic h may come under public scrutiny. What is the difference between th e JASON Scholars or JASON Society and the JASON Group? The documents th at I read referred to the JASON Society in exactly those words. In public documents the only JASON reference is to the JASON Group, admini stered by the Mitre Corporation. I believe the JASON Society is one of the highest degrees above the Skull & Bones and the Scroll & Key in the Illuminati. In othe r words, it is a higher level of initiation. The JASON Group is a scientific organization formed and hired by the JASON Society and the U.S. Government for obvious reasons. I know a lot more about the JASON Society and the JASON Group, but I do not want to injure Mr. Gran t Cameron, who has done extensive research on these subjects. He will publish his research in the coming months. I guarantee his findings will amaze you.

The members of the Order make up the Executive Committee of the Council on Foreign Relations after undergoing initiation into the Order of the Quest, also known as the JASON Society. The Council on Foreign Relations is an off-shoot sister organization to the British Royal Institute of International Affairs. Their goal is a New World Order. Although it existed as a dinner club in New York, it did not take on its present power until 1921, when it merged with the Royal Institute of International Affairs a nd received its financial base from J.R Morgan, the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller family, and other Wall Street banking interests. The Council on Foreign Relations controls our government. Through the years its members have infiltrat ed the entire executive branch, State Department, Justice Department, CIA, and the top ranks of the military. EVERY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CFR. MOST PRESIDENTS SINCE ROOSE- VELT HAVE BEEN MEMBERS. The members of the CFR dominate owner- ship of the press and most, if not all, of America's top journalists are members. The CFR does not conform to government policy. The govern- ment conforms to CFR policy. The appendix contains the most current list of CFR members that I was able to locate. I read Top Secret documents while with Naval Intelligence that stated that President Eisenhower had appointed six of the Executive Committee members of the CFR to sit on the panel called Majesty Twelve also known as Majority Twelve for security reasons. Majesty Twelve is the secret group that is supposed to control extraterr estrial information and projects. The documents stated that Eisenhower had also appointed six members from the Executive branch of government w ho were also members of the CFR. The total membership of Majesty Twelve was nineteen, including Dr. Ed- ward Teller and the six members from the JASON scientific group. Again, whether this is true or disinformati on depends solely upon the existence of aliens. The CFR is a secret society in that it forbids the taking of notes or the publishing of minutes of its meetings. Any member who divulges the subject or any part of any conversa tion or talk that took place during a meeting is terminated. The goal of the Council on Foreign Relations is a New World Order. George Bush is a member of the CFR. Knights of Malta play a powerful role in this scenario. In the 1930s General Smedley Butler was recr uited to help take over the White House.

At the top of th e list was John J. Raskob, who was a founding member of th e U.S. branch of the Knights of Malta. He was board chairman of Gene ral Motors. He was, at the time, the U.S. Treasurer of the Knights of Malt a. Congressional h earings were held to investigate the plot, but none of those named, in cluding Raskob, was ever called to testify and nothing ever came of the hear ings. Although you will find this in the Cong ressional records, you w ill NEVER find it in ANY history book anywhere. It is significant that the Iran-Cont ra episode has many similarities to the 1930s plot. William Ca sey was a member of the Knights of Malta. William Casey, with the help of Vice President Bush, Anne Armstrong and Donald Regan, caused the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board to be emasculated so that Bush, Ca sey, North and others could carry out their dirty deeds without oversight. They had also developed a plan to suspend the Constitution of the United States and were preparing to imple- ment the plan when they were caught. These facts emerged from the hearings but were suppressed by the committee chairman, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. You must understand that tremendous power was involved in both attemp ts to overthrow the United States Government. William Casey was the Director of th e CIA. He was a member of the CFR. Casey was a Knight of Malta. He was the he ad of Ronald Reagan's political campaign. He wa s head of the Securitie s and Exchange Commis- sion. During the Nixon administratio n he was head of the Export-Import Bank. Casey arranged financing for the Kama River truck factory in the Soviet Union with 90% of the funds gu aranteed or furnished by the U.S. taxpayer. This factory bu ilt military truck and tank engines for the Soviet Army. It was, and may s till be, the largest factory in the world and could produce more heavy trucks than all U.S. factories together. I believe Casey was murdered. The Knights of Malta is a world or ganization with it s threads weaving through business, bankin g, politics, the CIA, othe r intelligence organiza- tions, P2, religion, education, law, military, think tanks, foundations, the United States Information Agency, the United Nations, and numerous other organizations. They are not the oldest but are one of the oldest branches of the Order of the Quest in existence. The world head of the Knights of Malta is elected for a life term, with th e approval of the Pope. The Knights of Malta have their own Constitution and are sworn to work toward the establishment of a New Worl d Order with the Po pe at its head. Knights of Malta members are also powerful members of the CFR and the Trilateral Commission."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Chapter Two Secret Societies and the New World Order • 87 The Vatican has been infiltrated ove r many years by the Illuminati. This is easily proven by the fact that in 1738 Pope Clement XII issued a Papal Bull which stated that any Catholic who became a Mason would be excommunicated, a very serious punishment. In 1884 Pope Leo XIII issued a proclamation stating that Masonry was one of the secret societies at- tempting to \"revive the manners and cu stoms of the pagans'' and \"estab- lish Satan's kingdom on Earth.\" Piers Compton, in his book The Broken Cross, traces the infiltration of the Ca tholic Church by the Illuminati. He has found the use of the all-seeing eye in the triangle by leading Catholics and by the Jesuits. It was used in the seal of the Philadelphia Eucharistic Congress in 1976. It was on a special issue of Vatican stamps in 1978, announcing the final Illuminati victory to the world. Mr. Compton claims that Pope John XXIII wore the \"all-seeing eye in the triangle\" on his personal cross. Compton is adamant that several HUNDRED leading Catholic priests, bishops and cardinals are members of secret societies. He quotes an article in an Italian Journal that lists more than 70 Vatican officials, including Pope Paul VI's pr ivate secretary, the director general of Vatican radio, the Archbishop of Florence, the prelate of Milan, the assis- tant editor of the Vatican newspaper, several Italian bishops, and the abbot of the Order of St. Benedict. Those are only the ones that are known and only the ones known in Italy. It is widely believed that THIS Pope, John Paul XXII, is a member of the Illuminati. I believe, according to my re- search, that it is true. The best indication of infiltration is that on Novem- ber 27,1983, the Pope retracted all of the Papal Bulls against Freemasonry and allowed Catholics, after several hundred years, to again become mem- bers of secret societies without fear of excommunication. The goal of the Illuminati to elect one of their own to the Papacy appears to have come to fruition. If that is the case, the New Wo rld Order is just on the horizon. Now is the time. The first U.S. Ambassador to the Va tican was William Wilson, a Knight of Malta. His appointment was probabl y illegal and, for a fact, was highly unethical. Wilson could not possibly have represented the U.S. when his allegiance was sworn to the Pope. Wilson, if you will remember, took an unauthorized trip to Libya and met privately with Libyan officials at a time when travel to Libya had been banned by the President. President R onald Reagan had called Gadhafi \"a mad dog\" and made a few strong threats. The U.S. had been resolute in bombing Libya even though civilians were killed. Following Wilson's trip, Gadhafi issued a press release stating that \"an American diplomat had been sent to reduce tensions with Libya.\" The State Department denied that any such thing had taken place. Ambassador Wilson closed his mouth"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"88 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper and refused any comment. To this da y he has said nothing, even though his actions made a liar of the United States and embarrassed us worldwide. A clue to what was happening is the fact that while we had cut off Libya and even bombed them and while travel by U. S. citizens to Libya was forbidden, five huge oil conglomera tes were filling their pockets deal- ing with Gadhafi. One of the compan ies was headed by J. Peter Grace, President of W.R. Grace. Eight members of the W.R. Grace Company are members of the Knights of Malta. Accord ing to an article by Leslie Geld in the New York Times, administration o fficials had expressed concern about Mr. Wilson's activities. These actions, they said, often seem to revolve around his contacts and intere st in the oil business. Wilson should have been fired, but instead nothing happened except that he and his wife attended a Papal Easter Mass and st ood next to George Schultz and his wife. In diplomatic language this indicated private ap- proval of his actions. George Schultz, of course, is a member of the CFR, the Bohemian Club and the Bechtel Co rporation, all of which have close ties to the Order and the Knights of Malta. Wilson engaged in several other improprieties during his ambas- sadorship. Again, in each case noth ing happened. Finally he resigned. Later, if you will remember, Presiden t Reagan suffered a fall from a horse on William Wilson's ranch in Mexico. Do you seriou sly think that Presi- dent Reagan would have visited Wilson's home in Mexico if he had not approved of Wilson's actions while he was the U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican? Knight of Malta Myron Taylor was President Roosevelf s envoy. Knight of Malta John McCone was President Kennedy's envoy and he was also the Director of the CIA during th e early '60s. A former mayor of New York City, Robert Wagner, was Pres ident Jimmy Carter's envoy. Frank Shakespeare replaced William Wilson. Frank Shakespeare is a Knight of Malta, and so it goes. President Reagan spoke at the annual Knights of Malta dinner. The Knights of Malta A LL have diplomatic imm unity. They can ship goods across borders without paying du ty or undergoing customs check. Does that ring any bells? In any case, that is power. The Knights of Malta is held up by a backbone consisting of nobility.

This cements the a lliance between the Vatican and the \"Black Nobility.\" The Bl ack Nobility is mostly the rich and powerful of Europe.

Therefore, a U.S. ambassador who is also a member of the Knights of Malta faces a conflict of interest. Why is this fact ignored? President Bush appointed Knight of Malta Thomas Melledy to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican. The Vatican has founded the Pope John Paul II Center for Prayer and Study for Peace at 1711 Ocean Avenue, Springlake, New Jersey, in a man- sion overlooking the ocean. The mansion was given to the New York Archdiocese by the estate of Elmer Bobst, who died in 1978. He was a multimillionaire and chairman of Warner Lambert Company. Richard Nixon was a frequent visitor. Directors of the Center were Kurt Waldheim, former Secretary General of the United Nations and ex-nazi war criminal; Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of State under Carter and member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission; Clare Booth Luce, a dame of the Knights of Malta; and J. Peter Grace of W.R. Grace Company, who is head of the Knights of Malta in the United States. The Center was set up by the Vatican as a part of the Pope's new peace plan, which will bring the world together (see my paper \"The Secret Government\"). The Center has two roles: (1) Educate Catholics and their children to accept the New World Order. (2) Provide residence for the world-peace-solution computer and an ongoing study for peaceful solu- tions to any future problems which may endanger world peace. The com- puter is hooked to the world capitals via satellite. All nations have agreed to relinquish sovereignty to the Pope and submit future problems to the computer for solution. Of course, this will not go into effect until the New World Order is publicly announced. I believe that the New World Order was born in secrecy on January 19,1989. Now you know. Acquaint yourself anew with the teachings of Jesus. Compare his teachings with the tenets of the Illuminati and then compare it with the following. The Vatican has stated at various times that \"the Pope is for total disarmament; the Pope is for elimination of the sovereignty of the nation states; the Pope is also stati ng that property rights are not to be considered true property rights. The Pope believes that only the Vatican knows what is right for man.\" In the early 1940s, the I.G. Farben Chemical Company employed a Polish salesman who sold cyanide to the Nazis for use in Auschwitz. The same salesman also worked as a chem ist in the manufacture of the poison gas. This same cyanide gas along w ith Zyklon B and malathion was used to exterminate millions of Jews a nd other groups. Their bodies were then burned to ashes in the ovens.

The salesman was ordained Poland's youngest bishop in 1958. After a 30-day reign his predecessor was assassinated and our ex-cyanide gas salesman assumed the papacy as Pope John Paul II. 1990 is the right time with the right leaders: ex-chief of the Soviet secret police Mikhail Gorbachev, ex-chief of the CIA George Bush, ex-Nazi cyanide gas salesman Pope John Paul II, all bound by an unholy alliance to ring in the New World Order. The Pope has challenged world leaders by claiming that the people of the world already recognize the absolu te authority of Rome because they observe the Sunday Sabbath that was ordered by the Pope in the Council of Laodicea (A.D. 364). The original Ten Commandments given Moses by God ordered that we should: Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it Holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it. The seventh day, the Sabbath as hande d to Moses by God, is Saturday The celebration of Sunday as the Sabbath is verification that the people recognize the Pope as SUPERIOR TO GOD. The only WHOLE people who have not recognized the authority of the Pope are the Jewish people, and that is why the Vatican has not and will not recognize the state of Israel.

Khomeini proved that. This Pope has enough following and charisma to make what we consider a great threat in this move.\" [Quote from The Mantooth Report.] \"Pope John Paul II is most anxious to complete his goal. His goal is to reunite the Christian World under the LEADERSHIP OF THE PAPACY. If at all possible, he hopes to reach his goa l by the end of this century. This is the primary reason behind the Pope's many worldwide trips.\" [From an article by Gene H. Hogberg, Nov./Dec. 1989, Plain Truth.] Were you aware that Hitler and his entire staff were Catholic? Did you know that the Nazis dabbled in the occult? Did you know that the New York Times of April 14,1990, quotes George Bush as stating, \"Lefs forgive the Nazi war criminals.\" I wonder why he said that? Did you know that the Los Angeles Times, December 12,1984, quoted Pope John Paul II as saying, \"Don't go to God for forgiveness of sins, come to me.\" The Pope committed blasphemy, thus fulfilling prophecy according to the book of Revelation. The Pope is telling us that HE IS God! REMEMBER—NEVER WORSHIP A LEADER. IF YOU WORSHIP A LEADER, YOU THEN NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOG- NIZE WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED! On July 21, 1773, Pope Clement XIV \"forever annulled and extin- guished the Jesuit Order.\" France, Spain and Portugal had independently come to realize that the Jesuits were meddling in the affairs of the state and were therefore enemies of the government. The Pope's action was a res- ponse to pressure applied by the monarchies. King Joseph of Portugal signed a decree \"by which the Jesuits were denounced as 'traitors, rebels and enemies to the realm...'\" Pope Pius VII in August, 1814, reinstated the Jesuits to all of their former rights and privileges. Ex-President John Adams wrote to his successor, Thomas Jefferson: \"I do not like the re-appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth ...it is this Society...\" Jefferson replied: \"Like you, I disapprove of the restoration of the Jesuits, for it means a step backwards from light into darkness.\" The Jesuits are still in trouble today as they have been throughout their existence. On February 28,1982, Pope Paul II told the Jesuits to \"keep clear of politics and honor Roman Catholic tradition.\" U.S. News and World Report stated that the Jesuits had indeed meddled in the affairs of nations."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"92 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper The article stated: \"Jesuits have play ed leading roles in Nicaragua's San- dinista revolution.

Wherever the Jesuits go, revolu tion quickly follows. I am always sad when I see or hear of people being hurt; but according to my research, the Jesuit priests murdered in Central Amer ica probably deserved it. The most powerful secret organizatio n in the world is the Bilderberg Group, organized in 1952 and named afte r the hotel where its first meeting took place in 1954. The man who orga nized the Bilderbe rg Group, Prince Bernhard of the Netherla nds, has the power to veto the Vatican's choice of any Pope it selects. Prince Bernhard has this veto power because his family, the Hapsburgs, are desended from the Roman emperors. Prince Bernhard is the leader of the Black Families. He claims descent from the House of David and thus can truly say th at he is related to Jesus. Prince Bernhard, with the help of the CIA, brou ght the hidden ruli ng body of the Illuminati into public knowledge as the Bilderberg Group. This is the official alliance th at makes up the wo rld govern ing body. The core of the organization is th ree committees made up of thirteen members each. Thus the heart of the Bi lderberg Group cons ists of 39 total members of the Illuminati. The three committees are made up exclusively of members of all the diff erent secret groups that make up the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Vatican, and the Black Nobility. This committee works year round in offices in Switzerland. It determines who is invited to the annual meeting and what policies a nd plans will be discussed. Every proposal or plan that ha s ever been discussed at an annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group has come to pass usua lly within one or two years follow- ing the meeting.

You know that the original number of states in the United States of America was 13. The Constitution has 7 Articles and was signed by 39 member s of the Constitutional Convention. The United States was born on July 4,1776. July is the 7th month of the year. Add 7 (for July) and 4 and you have 11; 1+7+7+6 = 21, which is a multiple of 3 and 7. Add 2+1 and you get 3. Look at the numbers in 1776 and you see two 7s and a 6, which is a multiple of 3. Coincidence, you say? I say, \"Baloney!\" and I'd really like to say something a lot stronger. For those of you who still say it's accidental, however, I offer the following evidence. I could write a book just on numerical links, but I won't. Manly P. Hall, 33rd-degree Mason, probably the most renowned ex- pert on these subjects, wrote in his book The Secret Destiny of America, \"For more than THREE THOUSAND YEARS [WC emphasis], secret societies have labored to create the background of knowledge necessary to the establishment of an enlightened democracy among the nations of the world....all have continued...and they still exist, as the Order of the Quest. Men bound by a secret oath to labor in the cause of world democracy decided that in the American colonies they would plan the roots of a new way of life. The Order of the Quest...was set up in America before the middle of the 17th century....Franklin s poke for the Order of the Quest, and most of the men who worked with him in the early days of the American Republic were also members....Not only were many of the founders of the United States Government Masons, but they received aid from a secret and august body existing in Europe which helped them to establish this country for a particular purpose known only to the initiated few.\" I found these quotes in a book on page 133. When added together, 1+3+3 equal the number 7 — coincidence? I think not. We can get a little insight into the Or der of the Quest from Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, the man directly res- ponsible for the printing of the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States on the one-dollar bill. Mr. Wallace, a member of the Order of the Quest, wrote in a letter to the Russian mystic and artist Nicholas Roerich: \"The search — whether it be for the lost word of Masonry, or the Holy Chalice, or the potentialities of the age to come — is the one supremely worthwhile objective. All else is karmic duty. But surely everyone is a potential Gala- had? So may we strive for the Chalice and the flame above it.\" The Holy Grail has a way of popping up on a regular basis in the writings of secret In the Great Seal of the United States we see the ancient symbol of the Brotherhood of the Snake (or Dragon), which as you already know is the all-seeing eye in the pyramid representing Lucifer in the form of wisdom."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"94 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Just below the pyramid you will note \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" which translated means, \"New World Order.\" There are 9 tail feathers on the eagle; 13 leaves in the olive branches; 13 bars and stripes; 13 arrows; 13 letters in \"E Pluribus Unum\"; 13 stars in the gr een crest above; 13 stones in the pyramid; 13 letters in \"Annuit Coeptis.\" Thirteen is the mystical number as signed to Satan, according to Stan Deyo in his excellent book entitled Cosmic Conspiracy. All of these mystic al numbers also have special meaning to the Free- masons. You would have to be a de vout skeptic to miss the tremendous significance of all of these suppose d coincidences. Who among you can still say that there is no link? I read while in Naval Intelligence that at least once a year, maybe more, two nuclear submarines meet beneath the polar icecap and mate together at an airlock. Representatives of the Soviet Union meet with the Policy Committee of the Bilderberg Group. The Russians are given the script for their next performance. It ems on the agenda include the com- bined efforts in the secret space pr ogram governing Alternative 3. I now have in my possession official NASA photographs of a moonbase in the crater Copernicus. This method of meeting is the only way that is safe from detection and/or bugging. The public outcry th at would result would destroy everything should these meetings be discovered. A BBC-TV documentary program entitled \"Science Report\" revealed these same facts but subse- quently issued a retraction. In their re traction they stated that the show had been fiction. It must be noted here that \"Science Report\" was a very respected documentary — nonfiction — program in Britain. Never in its history had it ever aired fi ction. This subject is expl ored in depth in another chapter. There is no other method that I know of to veri fy these meetings short of somehow becoming a crew me mber on one of th e submarines. Is Alternative 3 true, or is it a part of th e plan to ring in the New World Order? It really doesn't matter, because e ither way we're screwed. The quicker you understand that, the wiser you become.

The meetings provide an infor- mal, off-the-record opportunity for international leaders to mingle, and are notorious for the cloak of secrecy they are held under. The headquarters office is in The Hague in Switzerland, the only European country never invaded or bombed during World Wars I and II. Switzerland is the seat of world power. The goal of the Bilderberg Group is a one-world totalitarian socialist government and economic syst em. Take heed, as time is running short. You must understand that secrecy is wrong. The very fact that a meeting is secret tells me that something is going on that I would not approve. Do not ever believe that gr own men meet on a regular basis just to put on fancy robes, hold candles , and glad-hand each other. George Bush, when he was initiated into the Sk ull & Bones, did not lie naked in a coffin with a ribbon tied around his geni talia and yell out the details of all his sexual experiences because it was fun. He had much to gain by accept- ing initiation into the Order, as you can now see. These men meet for important reasons, and their meetings are secret because what goes on dur i n g the meetings would not be approved by the community. THE VERY FACT THAT SOMETHING IS SECRET MEANS THERE IS SOME- THING TO HIDE. John Robison wrote Proofs of a Conspir acy in 1798, and I believe he said it best in the following passage from the book. \"Nothi ng is so dangerous as a mystic Association. The object remaining a secret in the hands of the managers, the rest simply put a ring in their own noses, by which they may be led about at pleasure; and still panting after the secret they are the better pleased the less they see of their way. \"A mystical object enables the leader to shift his ground as he pleases, and to accommodate himself to every current fashion or prejudice. This Again gives him almost unlimited powe r; for he can make use of these prejudices to lead men by troops. He finds them already associated by their prejudices, and waiting for a leader to concentrate their strength and set them in motion. And when once great bodies of men are set in motion, with a creature of their fancy for a gu ide, even the engineer himself cannot say, 'Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.'\" Is the common man really as stupid as the elite seem to believe? If he is, then maybe the average citizen is better off ignorant, being manipulated this way and that, whenever the elite deem it necessary. We will discover the answer very quickly when the co mmon man finds that his \"E\" ticket to Fantasy Land has just expired.

This evidence of the conflict between the rule of the few vers us popular government should be em- phasized on the minds of the people of the United States, that the conflict now waging throughout the world may be more clearly understood, for after all said the great pending war springs from the weakness and frailty of government by the few, where human error is far more probable than the error of the many where aggressive war is only permitted upon the author- izing vote of those whose lives are je opardized in the trenches of modern war."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"106 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Mr. SHAFROTH: Mr. President, I should like to have the Senator state whether in that treaty there was not a coalition formed between the powerf ul countries of Europe to reestablish the sovereignt y of Spain in the Republics of South and Central America? Mr. OWEN: I was just going to comment upon th at, and I am going to take but a few moments to do so because I realize the pressure of other matters. This Holy Alliance, having put a Bourbon prince upon the throne of France by force, then used France to suppress the constitut ion of Spain immediately afterwards and by this ve ry treaty gave her a s ubsidy of 20,000,000 francs annually to enable her to wage wa r upon the people of Spain and prevent their exercise of any me asure of the right of se lf-government. The Holy Alliance immediately did the same thing in Italy, by sending Austrian troops to Italy, where the people there attempted to exercise a like measure of liberal constitutional self-governme nt; and it was not until the printing press, which the Holy Alliance so stoutly opposed, taught the people of Europe the value of liberty that finally one country after another seized a greater and greater right of self-government until now it may be fairly said that nearly all the nations of Europe have a very large measure of self- government. However, I wished to call the attention of the Senate and the country to this important history in the growth of constitu tional popular self- government. The Holy Alliance made its powers felt by the wholesale drastic suppression of the press in Europe, by universal censorship, by killing free speech and all ideas of popular rights, and by the complete suppression of popular government. The Holy Alliance having destroyed popular government in Spain and in Italy, had well-laid plans also to destroy popular government in the American co lonies which had revolted from Spain and Portugal in Central an d South America under the influence of the successful example of the United States . It was because of this conspiracy against the American Re publics by the European monarchies that the great English statesman, Canning, called the attention of our Government to it, and our statesmen then, including Thomas Jefferson, took an active part to bring about th e declaration by President Monroe in his next annual message to the Congr ess of the United States that the United States would regard it as an act of hostility to the Government of the United States and an unfri endly act if this coalit ion or if any power of Europe ever undertook to establis h upon the American Continent any control of any American Republic or to acquire any territorial rights."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Chapter Four Secret Treaty of Verona • 107 This is the so-called Monroe doctrine. The threat under the secret treaty of Verona to suppress popular government in the American Repub- lics is the basis of the Monroe doctrine. This secret treaty sets forth clearly the conflict between monarchical government and popular government and the government of the few as against the government of the many. It is a part in reality, of developing popular sovereignty when we demand for women equal rights to life, to liberty, to the possession of property, to an equal voice in the making of the laws and the administration of the laws, This demand on the part of the wome n is made by men, and it ought to be made by men as well as by thinking, progressive women, as it will promote human liberty and human happiness.

Just because the secret treaty of Verona was signed in 1822 does not mean that the treaty is void.

The Constitution was set up to provide clear divisions of Legisla- tive, Judicial, and Executive powers. It was believed that this system would ensure that if one branch got out of hand the othe r two would act to keep the one in check. This balan ce of power was predicated upon the assumption that none of the three branches could or would infringe upon the power of the others. The Constitution is clear on the functi ons of each of the branches. The Legislative will make the laws. The J udicial will interpret the law. The Executive will decide policy and enfor ce the law. This, of course, is the simplest of explanations, but this is not a textbook on government. My intent is to acquaint you with simple ba sics of the balance of power so that you can then understand how it has been subverted. The Legislature (Congress in the fo rm of the House and Senate) is required to publish the la ws that are made , and this is done in the Congres sional Record and the Fede ral Register. Pending or passed legislation can be obtained by citizens through their Congressmen or from the Govern- ment Printing Office. Citizens cannot be held responsible for the law if it is not made available to them. It is paradoxical that the government body most representative of the American citizen is the one that has been the most easily subverted. Through PACs, payoffs, pork-barrel politi cs, professional politicians, Con- gressmen who are members of secret societies and through greed and fear, our Representatives and Senators quit representing us long ago. Congress has tremendous powers but fails in most cases to exercise even a token amount. How is it that our Legislature has allowed and at times encouraged the Executive branch to write law? You probably did not know that the President a nd others in the Executiv e branch of the govern- ment can and do write law. This is done in the form of Presidential Executive orders, National Security Council memos, National Security Decision directives, and Nati onal Security directives. NSC memos were broad policy papers in the days after passage of the National Security Act. NSC memos became narro wer and more specific over the years, and the na me has varied. Under Ke nnedy they were called National Security Action Memorandu ms. President Bush has changed the name to National Security Directives. There is a tremendous di fference between Presid ential Executive or- ders, NSC memos, and National Secur ity Decision directives. Presidential"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Good-bye USA, Hello New World Order • 111 Executive orders are listed in the Federa l Register or Presidential Findings, which are made known to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The most important difference between the Presidential Executive orders and all of the others, no matter what they are called, is that the others do not have to be reported, reviewed, made available to anyone, or even acknowledged that they exist. There is no oversight whatsoever that could maintain a check on the legality of these National Security directives. The President and others within the Executive branch have used these supersecret directives to skirt the balance of power and write law without anyone's knowledge. Jus- tification of the President's power to write law through Executive orders stems from the failure of the Government to rescind the declaration of martial law during the Civil War. In effect, the United States has been under martial law ever since Lincoln's administration. These NSDs are powerful, hidden, a nd dangerous tools. They were prolific during the Reagan administ ration: over 300 were written, with no more than 50 ever leaking out to und ergo public scrutiny. Yet most Ameri- cans have never heard of these subvers ive weapons. They are being used to destroy our Constitution. I believe that everyone should know about this corruption of government. Congress has turned a blind eye to these abuses of executive power. At 3:30 a.m. Saturday, August 4,1990, th e Senate made it even easier for the Executive branch to subv ert the Constitution and may have made George Bush the first American king. At that time on that day, a minority of United States senators, maybe ten at the most , passed Senate Intelligence Authori- zation Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (S.B. 283 4). This bill will fundamentally change our constitutional system and th reatens to destroy the very founda- tions of our great nation. Since attention has been focused upon the Middle East crisis, the public and most Congressmen know absolutely nothing about this bill. The bill was fraudulently introduced as a reform to prevent future incidents of the abuses brought to light during the Iran-Contra scandal. Instead of preventing future abuses, however, it virtually authorizes essen- tially every abuse. The bill was carefully brought to a vote by Senator Sam Nunn in the dead of night when th e opposition was gone. It effectively transfers most authority over the United States government directly into t h e h a n d s of George Bush and thus directly into the hands of the Secret Government. The President (presently George Bush) was given the power to initiate war, appropriate public funds, define foreign policy goals, and decide what is important to our national security. In \"Oversight of Intelligence Ac- "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"112 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper tivities,\" Tide VII, S.B. 2834 authorizes the following: Gives the president power to initiate covert actions (this has never before been given to the President) ; prevents Congress from stopping the President's initiation of covert actions; allows the President to use any federal ''departments, agencies, or entitie s'' to operate or finance a covert operation; empowers the President to use any other nation or private contractor or person to fund or operate a covert action; redefines covert actions as operations \"necessary to s upport foreign policy objectives of the United States,\" a definition that is so vague and broad as to be essentially unlimited; for the first time officially cl aims the right of the United States to secretly interfere in the in ternal \"political, economic, or military affairs\" of other countries in direct and flagrant violation of international law; re- quires that the President prepare a nd deliver a written finding to the Intelligence committees of the Congress but allows the President to omit \"extremely sensitive matters\" and aut horizes the President to claim execu- tive privilege if Congress asks too many questions. There are no penalties in the bill for violating any of its provisions, including the provision requiring a fi nding. Why should there be? This bill has literally handed the power of all the branches of government to the President on a silver pl atter. President Bush is now truly American King George the First. S.B. 2834 gives Bu sh the power to use any agency or branch of the gover nment and any approp riated funds from any agency or branch of the government for covert action even if they were never ap- propriated for that purpose. The bill effectively prevents any oversight by anyone and allows the Executive branch to skirt the law and to escape accountability. This will be done usin g National Security directives. A few examples of past NSD di rectives that have come to light will help you understand the seriousness of the matter. They will be listed in the follow- ing paragraphs under the heading of the subject matter of the NSDDs: NSDD 84: SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMA- TION [SECRECY], 3/11/83 (Declassified in full). SUBJECT: This directive drastically expands restrictions on government employees' freedom of speech. Those with access to classified information were required to sign a nondisclosure agreement; thos e with access to a spec ial category of clas- sified information were made to ag ree to prepublication review of any future writings. The use of polygrap hs was authorize d. PURPOSE: Pre- vent disclosure of information that could damage national security.

Author's Note: NSDD 84 indicates that John Lear, Robert Lazar, Bruce Macabbee, Stanton Friedman, Clifford Stone, and many others may be active government agents. They were all worki ng in government jobs or for govern- ment contractors and all of them were subject to this executive order. NSDD 84 was not used to silence them, which seems to indicate that they had executive approval in each and every instance. NSDD 17: DETERRING CUBAN MODELS/COVERT ACTION IN NICARAGUA, 11/23/81 (Classified). SUBJECT: The Central Intelligence Agency was given authority to create the contras and \"work with foreign governments as appropriate\" to underm ine the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. PURPOSE: To stop the flow of arms from Cuban and Nicara- guan sources to the Salvadoran rebe ls. CONSEQUENCES: The C.I.A. was given $19 million to assemble and arm a force of 500 contras to join with 1000 exiles already being trained by Argentina. Scores of operatives ar- rived in Honduras; arms shipments from Miami began. The contra war was set in motion. NSDD 77: MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC DIPLOMACY RELATIVE TO NATIONAL SECURITY, 1/14/83 (Declassified in full). SUBJECT: This directive set up several planning gr oups to conduct \"public diplomacy activities.\" It ordered \"organiza tional support for foreign governments and private groups to encourage the growth of democratic political institu- tions and practices.\" PURPOSE: To mobilize international and domestic support for \"our national security objectives.\" CONSEQUENCES: Created propaganda ministries in the National Security Council, the State Department and the White House that c oncentrated on, in the words of the NSC staff member in charge of the program, \"gluing black hats on the Sandinistas and white hats on UNO\" (the contras' United Nicaraguan Opposition). Stories were planted in the press; journalists were pressured. The General Accounting Office later found that these activities violated the law banning \"covert propaganda\" inside the United States. How many other covert propaganda programs do yo u think are operating against the American Citizens? I can assure you that there are many more than you would ever believe.

PURPOSE: To lessen"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"114 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper international terrorism and free U.S. hostages in Lebanon. While this NSD directive pretends to be concerned about internationa l terrorism, it is really a thinly disguised author ization of preemptive stri kes and retaliatory raids against patriots in this country. When FEMA is activated, patriots will be rounded up in the dead of night, most likely on a national holiday such as Thanksgiving. Government agents a nd law-enforcement officers in every city across the nation have received antiterrorist traini ng under this NSDD directive, and I can assure you the target is patriots. CONSEQUENCES: Set up the Terrorist Inci dent Working Group under North in the NSC. Its first major action was the interceptio n and capture of the Achille Lauro hijackers, which ga ve North's career an important boost. Either NSDD 138 or a subsequent NSD directive on terrorism authorized the training of three Le banese units for preemptive strikes. When problems arose, Director of Central Intelligence William Casey took that operation off the books and enliste d Saudi Arabian help in an attempt to assassinate the head of Hezbollah. A resulting car bom bing killed about eighty in Beirut; Sheik Fadlallah, the target was unhurt. The U.S. military, along with civilian law-enforcement te ams, conducted joint antiterrorist training across America. To allay public fears the participants wore civilian clothing. NSD directives have be come the de f acto legislative vehicle of the national security state. It has become known throu gh the research of Susan Fitzgerald, a research consultant at the Fund for Constitutional Govern- ment in Washington who has collected declassified NSD directives, that many were released with out the White House letter head at the top of the page and without the Pres ident's signature at the bottom. This, she specu- lates, is to conceal the fact that the signatures on some of them would reveal that they had been made by autope n, not by Ronald Reagan's own hand. That should give you a taste of what we are up against. Please understand that virtually all but a very few NSD di rectives still remain classified, and unless the public forces disclosure their effect will probably never be known. Somewhere within the volumes of secr et NSD directives there is a plan to suspend the Constitution of the United States of America. The existence of this plan surfaced during the Iran-Contra hearings. Congressman Jack Brooks (D), Texas, attempted to bring it into the open. When he asked Col. North directly if North had ever help ed draft a plan to suspend the Con- stitution, Brooks was sile nced by the committee ch airman Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D), Hawaii.

I would"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Good-bye USA, Hello New World Order • 115 like to know who gave anyone, in any branch of government, with any title, the right to suspend the Constitution at any time, for any reason, under any conditions? I believe the plan to suspend the Constitution is directly tied to the underground facility called Mount Weat her and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Mount Weather is so shrouded in secrecy that 99.9% of Americans have never heard of it. FEMA, however, is another story. Remember Hurricane H ugo? Remember the federal agency (FEMA) that was sent to handle the emergency and was thrown out by the citizens because of gross incompeten ce? FEMA was incompetent, because \"emergency management\" is just a guise for its real purpose, which is to take over local, state, and federal gove rnment in case of a national emer- gency. The only way FEMA could do such a thing is if the Constitution Were suspended and martial law were to be declared. Therefore its very exi stence is proof positive that a plan to suspend the Cons titution does in fact exist. MOUNT WEATHER Just outside of a sleepy little town called Bluemont, Virginia, about 46 miles west of Washington D.C., is an area of wilderness covering what has been called the toughest granite rock in the eastern United States. The area is surrounded by signs marked \"Rest ricted Area\" and \"This installation has been declared a restricted area....Unauthorized entry is prohibited.\" Other signs state: \"All persons and vehicles entering hereon are liable to search. Photographing, making notes, dr awings, maps or graphic repre- sentations of this area or its activities is prohibited. Such material found in the possession of unauthorized persons will be confiscated. Internal Secur- ity Act of 1950.\" The installation is beneath a mountain and its name is the Western Virginia Office of Controlled Conflict Operations. Its nickname is Mount Weather. It was ordered to be built by the Federal Civil Defense Administration, which is now the Federal Preparedness Agency. Mount Weather was designed in the early '50s as part of a civil defense program to house and protect the Executive branch of the Federal govern- ment. The official name was \"The Continuity of Government Program.\" Congress has repeatedly tried to discover the real purpose of Mount Weather, but so far has been unable to find out ANYTHING about the secret installation. Retired Air Force General Leslie W. Bray, director of the Federal Preparedness Agency, told the Senate Subcommittee on Constitu- tional Rights in September 1975: \"I am not at liberty to describe precisely what is the role and the mission and the capability that we have at Mount Weather or at any other precise location.\" In June 1975, Senator John Tunney (D), California, chairman of the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, charged that Mount Weather held dossiers on at least 100,000 Americans. He later alleged that the Mount Weather computers, described as \"the best in the world,\" can obtain mil- lions of pieces of additional information on the personal lives of American citizens simply by tapping the data st ored at any of the other 96 Federal Relocation Centers. I know from my stint with the Office of Naval Intelligence that these dossiers consist of information collect ed about American patriots, men and women who are most likely to resist the destruction of our Constitution and the formation of the totalitarian police state under the New World Order. The patriot data bank is cons tantly updated so that when the appointed hour arrives all patriots can be rounded up with little if any effort. The plan calls for this to be accomplished in the dead of night on a national holiday. The most likely holiday is Thanksgiving, when everyone, no matter the religion, race, or creed, will be at home. The targets will be ripe for the picking after a heavy meal, maybe some alcoholic beverages, and during a deep sleep. There is a tr aitor in the patriot movement who provides the Secret Government with accurate names and addresses of patriots who will fight to prot ect and defend the Constitution. MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT NO PATRIOT SHOULD EVER BE AT HOME OR AT THE HOME OF ANY FAMILY MEMBER ON ANY HOUDAY EVER AGAIN UNTIL THE TRAITORS HAVE BEEN HUNG AND THE CONSTITUTION RESTORED AS THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. Some sources state that Mount Weat her is virtually an underground city complete with dormitories, priv ate apartments, streets, sidewalks, cafeterias, hospitals, water-purification systems, power plant, office build- ings, a lake fed by fresh water fro m underground springs, a mass-transit system, and many other astounding things. Several disturbing facts emerge when one researches Mount Weather. One is the conclusion that a complete parallel government exists at the site. Nine Federal departments exist there — Agriculture, Commerce, HEW, HUD, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, and the Treasury. Apparently at least five Federal agencies are also in residence: FCC, Selective Service, Federal Power Commission, Civil Serv ice Commission, and the Veterans Administration. Two privately owned corporations have offices at Mount Weather: the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Post Office. There is also an Office of the Presidency. What makes all this upsetting is that there is a President and a complete set of cabinet officers in residence at Mount Weather. Who are they and who appoi nted them? Where is such a thing provided for in the Constitution of the United States of America?"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Good-bye USA, Hello New World Order • 117 Mount Weather is the operational center — the hub — of over 96 other underground Federal Relocation Ce nters scattered across the United States. The majority of these appear to be concentrated in Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. Each of these facilities contains computer data banks holding information — not on enemy agents, Soviet diplomats, or suspected terrorists but on American citizens, patriots. A list of other files kept at the facilities was furnished to the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights in 1975. The list included \"military installations, government f acilities, communications, transporta- tion, energy and power, agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale and retail services, manpower, financial, medical and educational institutions, sani- tary facilities, population, hous ing shelter, and stockpiles.\" The committee concluded that these data bases \"operate with few, if any, safeguards or guidelines.\" Senator James Abourzek (D), South Dakota, a member of the subcommittee, said, \"I feel the entire operation has eluded the supervision of either Congress or the courts.\" Chairman Tunney said, \"Mount Weather is out of control.\" Nothing was done by Congress to rectify the situation, however, and Mount Weather remains out of control. Former high-level officials from M ount Weather agree that the base at Mount Weather is much more than any standby government facility or storage center for the preservation of records; they describe it as an AC- TUAL GOVERNMENT-IN-WAITING. \"We do not merely store essential information; the facility attempts to duplicate the vital functions of the Executive branch of the Administrati on.\" As stated above, according to my research, this includes a President and all Cabinet members actually in residence. Protocol even demands that subordinates address them as \"Mr. President\" or \"Mr. Secretary.\" Most of these mysterious appointees have held their positions through several administrations. \"We just act on the orders of the President in national emergencies,\" said one former Mount Weather official. The FPA in its 1974 Annual Report stated that \"Studies conducted at Mount Weather involve the control and management of domestic political unrest where there are material shortages (such as food riots) or in strike situations where the FPA determines that there are industrial disruptions and other domestic resource crises.\" The report states that the bureaucracy at Mount Weather invokes what it calls \"Civil Crisis Management.\" Officials who were at Mount Weathe r and who have furnished us with data say that during the 1960s the complex was actually prepared to assume certain governmental powers at the time of the 1961 Cuban missile crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy In 1963. The source said"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper that the installation used the tools of its \"Civil Crisis Management\" pro- gram on a standby basis during the 1 967 and 1968 urban ri ots and during a number of national antiwar demonstrations against the administration by the American people. Daniel J. Cronin, who wa s the assistant director for the FPA, outlined a massive surveillance and manipulation program that is directed against the American population on a continuing basis. The FPA has organized an impressive armament of resources and equipment. Mr. Cronin described in an interview his agen cy's attitude towa rd its wide-rangi ng surveillance program. \"We try to monitor situations,\" he said, \"and get to them before they become emergencies....No expens e is spared in the monitoring pro- gram.\" He cited reconnaissance sate llites, local and state police intelli- gence reports, and law-enforcement agencies of the Federal government as examples of the resources available to the FPA for information-gathering. The only document that I was able to find that attempts to outline some of the statutory authority of Mount Weather is Executive Order 11490. It was drafted by Gen. George A. Lincoln, former director for the Office of Emergency Preparedness (pr eceded FPA) and was signed into law by President Nixon in October 1969. Executive Order 11490 superseded Executive Order 11051, signed on October 2,196 2, by President Kennedy. Kennedy's order used the language, \"Whereas, national preparedness must be achieved—as may be required to deal with increases in internation- al tension with limi ted war, or with general wa r including atta ck upon the United States...\" Nixon's order began: \"Whereas our national security is dependent upon our ability to assure continuity of government, at every level, in any national emergency type situation that might conceivably confront the nation...\" Nixon has delete d any reference to \"war,\" \"im- minent attack,\" and \"general war\" fr om the order and replaced them with the phrase \"during any emergency that might CONCEIVABLY occur.\" Nixon's order, which is the one in effect today, allows the government in the form of FEMA to suspend the Constitution for literally any reason they decide to call a national em ergency. I CANNOT FIND A PLAN OR EXECUTIVE ORDER ANYWHERE WHICH OUTLINES ANY PROCE- DURE OR ALLOWANCE FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE CONSTITU- TION AFTER A NATIONAL EMERGE NCY HAS ENDED. THIS LEADS TO THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT NO RESTORATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IS CONTEMPLATED OR DESIRED BY THOSE IN POWER. In 1975, Senator Tunn ey expressed concern, \"We know, from what we've heard in the press, that 15,000 names were being maintained by the FBI for detention in an emergency...We also know that the IRS had its files"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Chapter Five Good-bye USA, Hello New World Order • 119 on individual taxpayers.

My question is this: Is there anyone like your- self, General Bray, that is in control of the overall access to this data if it is maintained in a relocation site? And your answer, as I understood it, is no.'' Tunney continued: \"General Bray, I must say that I still don't know who's in control of these relocation centers....You say you don't have that knowledge and still we don't know from the...three witnesses that we had here today, that they had information as to who has control of those centers.\" \"I am not at liberty,\" Bray answer ed, \"to describe precisely what is the role and the mission and the capability that we have at Mount Weather, or at any other precise location.\" I firmly believe that our Continuity of Government program has not provided continuity at all, but has been the instrument for discontinuing open a nd democratic government, and that the very program designed to protect Americans has actually been turned against us.

During those times, and without exception, we operated under directions issued by the White House.

If the President had declared a national emergency, that could have triggered it. Any instability in the Middle East — anythi ng, in fact. And they've already tested their ca pabilities in April 1984 with REX- 84A. And that was designed to test the readin ess of the U.S. civilian and military agencies to respond to a serious national se curity crisis. Now, the Executive order that will implement this, the Executive Order 11051, details responsibilities to the Office of Emergency Planning or FEMA. It gives authorization to put A LL Executive orders into effect in times of national emergency declared by the President, increased interna- tional tension or economical or financial crisis. (Note that it covers every conceivable domestic crisis but does not even mention war or nuclear attack.) Now, the only thing that has to happen for FEMA to be able to implement all the executive orders, em ergency executive or ders, is for the President to declare a national emerge ncy of any type, as long as it's a national emergency."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 123 Executive Order 10995 provides for the takeover of the communica- tions media.

Executive Order 11004 provides for the Housing and Finance Author- ity to relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations. Executive Order 11005 provides for the Government to take over railroads, inland waterways a nd public storage facilities. Now, all of these were COMBINED under Nixon into one huge Execu- tive order, which allows all of this to take place if the President declares a national emergency and it can be implemented by the head of FEMA, NOT BY THE PRESIDENT. The President has already given him that power under these executive orders. All of these were combined into Executive Order 11490 and that was signed by President Carter on July 20,1979, and is, in fact, law. So, if H.R. 4079 is passed and the President does what it says and declares a national emergency because of the drug situation, whether it's for one year, five years, five minutes or forever, it doesn't make any dif- ference. FEMA then can implement all these Executive orders, take over all local, state, and national governme nt suspend the Constitution and do whatever they want to do. Now, remember what North said during the Iran-Contra hearings. He said that they were prepared to suspend the Constitution of the United States. And he said if it hadn't been for their getting caught that this would have happened. And all that did was de lay it. This is what is still going to happen. Now, they've nominated (and I think he's been appointed) Maj. Gen. Calvin Franklin, who's the head of FEMA. He was nominated because of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"124 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper discussions proposing the removal of the implementation of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. And Maj. Gen. Franklin is or was the Com- manding General of the District of Columbia National Guard. Now, you've got to know that the National Guard would be of no help at all in combating drug traffic in W ashington, D.C, or anywhere else. The primary effectiveness of the National Guard is in controlling mass civil disorders. On March 24, President Bush issued a new Executive order delegating to the Director of FEMA powers which we re vested in the President by the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988. And although the order is described by the White House as simply a technical matter, in reality the revision delegates to the FEMA Director, direct responsibility for a large number of items which were earlier only the President's preroga- tive. And that includes responsibility fo r General Federal Assistance, Fed- eral Emergency Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, Individual and Family Grant Programs, and the power to direct other federal agencies to assist in an emergency. AND THAT'S THE KEY. All other federal agencies will come under FEMA. Of course, the President retains the power to actually declare an emer- gency, but as soon as he does that, the implementation of the measures utilized will be transferred directly to the Director of FEMA. The brains behind this contingency plan for a police state were the members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, both of which Bush is a member. And Brent Scocroft, National Security Adviser, who was a member of FEMA's Advisory Board until he was appointed by Bush to head the National Security Council, is a member of the Trilateral Commis- sion and also a business partner of Henry Kissinger, who has been a traitor to this country for many, many years. And of course Scocroft would become the superior to FEMA in the chain of command of the National Security Emergency whenever it is declared. The FEMA Advisory Board is dominated by Prof. Samuel P. Hun- tington. In 1978 Huntington drafted for Jimmy Carter Presidential Memo- randum 32, which led to the creation of FEMA in 1979. And he's a Harvard Professor. He wrote the \"Seminal Peace\" for the Trilateral Commission in the mid-1970s, recommending that democracy and economic development be discarded as outdated ideas. He wrote, as co-author of the book Crises in Democracy, \"We have come to recognize that there are potential desirable limits to economic growth. There are also potentially desirable limits to the indefinite extension of political democracy.

It identified important areas to be upgraded, such as the nation's industrial base to maintain the national defense, but it nonetheless — and this is very important — laid the groundwork for the secret government's options to institute a police state, and its title is Emer- gency Mobilization Preparedness. It ordered preparedness measures that involved the waiving or modification of socioeconomic regulations that delay emergency responses and that should receive priority attention. It also specified that preparedness measures that are or may be impeded by legal constraints be identified in the pr iority task that lays the groundwork for the SUSPENSION OF THE CONSTITUTION. Make copies of this tape if you wa nt to. You don't even have to transcribe it if you don't want to. BUT GET THIS OUT TO THE PEOPLE. It's important that they understand that if H.R. 4079 is passed — they're history. They won't pass it if we get this ou t to the people and tell them that this is what they're doing. Most people don't even know about it, and that's to the Secret Government's bene fit. If we get this out and tell people what they're doing, then people can ge t on the phone and then go down and kick their Congressman's ass (which is what they should have been doing years ago) and get this thing thrown out of Congress. And the next thing they need to do is throw their Congressmen and their Senators out of Congress — and keep them out of Congress. And put their neighbors in there, people they can trust, and keep them in there for only one term. THE CONSTITUTION IS IN SERIOUS DANGER. This has nothing to do with the right wing, left wing, or any other damn thing. It has to do with the Illuminati taking over this country and joining in the New World Order.

One is a clause that would eliminate the 4th amendment to the Constitution and the other would eliminate the 8th amendm ent to the Constitution.

On April 20, 1976, after a rapid and thorough investigation, I filed suit on behalf of the people of the United States against various personages that had a key part in a conspiratorial program to do away wi th the United States as we know it. This is a progress report to you, the plaintiffs, you, the People of the United States. The civil action number is 76-H-667. It is entitl ed, \"Complaint Against the Concentration Camp Program of the Dept of Defense\". It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the southern district of Texas, Houston divisi on. The judge responsible for the case was Judge Carl Bue. You have no doubt heard the story: Once upon a time, under the Nazi regime in Germany, a man worked on an assembly line in a baby carriage factory. His wife was going to have a baby, but the Nazi government would not let anybody buy a baby carriage. The man decided he would secretly collect one part from each department and assemble the carriage himself. When this was done he and his wife gathered up the pieces and assembled it. When they were finished they did not have a baby carriage; they had a machine gun. And that is exactly the situation that I am going to present to you at this time. The Center for the Study for Democratic Institutions recently completed a proposed constitution for the \"Newstates of America\" . The Center is Rockefeller funded. To give you an indication of the type of constitu tion proposed, the term \"national emergency\" is mentioned 134 times. The document did not have a Bill of Rights and the right to own arms was taken away. At the same time, House Concurrent Resolution #28 awaited for calling a constitutional conv ention on or before July 4, 1976. The presiding officer of such an event would have been Nelson Rockefeller. Vice Presidenl and president pro tern of the Senate. This particular resolution awaited in committee. Obviously money would not be spent on t hese massive programs unless there would be the chance for the actual impl ementation of such a scheme. However, in case the American people do not voluntarily adopt a new constitution less troublesome to those who desire dictatorship, there is Executive Order #11490. which will include its predecessors when it is cited herein. The Executive Order authorizes the secretaries of the various agencies to prepare for any \"national emergency\" type situation - includ ing, but not limited to, those specified in the Executive Order itself.

For any concei vable pretense a national emergency may be declared based 2"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 129 upon this frightening decree, dated October 1969. The Order itself was prefaced in March of '69 by another Executive Order which established the federal regions and their capitals. All the departments of the government were involved, including the L.E.A.A. (Law Enforcement Assistance Admi nistration) and H.E.W. (Health, Education and Welfare). Congressman Larry McDonald has revealed to Congress that various guerrilla and terrorist groups were being fi nanced by the federal government. If they (the terrorist groups) actually began insur gent activities, Executive Order #11490 would be activated. But as mentioned previously, if you will read Executive Order #11490, you will see that a \"national emergency\" may he declared for any c onceivable pretense whatsoever. If the Order itself were activated, here is what would happen: The next day you and your family would be standing in front of your local post office with your neighbors; the front door bursting with bl ock-long lines of people waiting to be registered. After waiting in line with your family for hours, you finally get channeled through the doors. Once inside, you over hear the postal clerk with his sidearm on telling a frightened restrant, \"Look, there is nothing I can do. The truck behind the building will take you to a work camp where you have been assigned. Your wife has been assigned to a factory and there's nothing I can do.\" Then your son or daughter looks up at you with a quivering voice and asks, \"Dad, why are we here?\" Implementing the New Government Well, you see there's much more to life in a \"free country\" than paying your mortgage. You have to be aware of what is going on and act accordingly and participate in government; that is, get in volved. Examining the organization chart on Executive Order #11490 to discover how we have all helped finance (through our tax dollars) the mechanics of the overthrow of our Constitution, Executive Order #11490 designates certain authorities to the Offi ce of Emergency Preparedness -- which in turn designates authority to the various departments of the federal government. If Order were implemented, the Post Office Department would be responsible for a national registration. The State Department would be responsible for the protection of the United Nations personnel or properly and prevention of escape from the United States. The Department of Defense would be responsible for the expropriation of industry; direction of services and national production system; control of censorship; and communication ex propriation of non-industrial facilities. The Commerce Department would be responsible for expropriation, selection and international distribution of commodities (which would be the actual looting of the United States), census information and human resources. The Treasury Department would be respons ible for collection of cash and non- cash items and the re-creation of evidence of assets and liabilities. The Justice Department would have concurrent responsibi lity with the Department of State for prevention of escape from the United States: for replenishing the stockpile of narcotics; for a national police force: for correctional and penal institutions; for mass feeding and housing of prisoners and for use of prisoners to augment manpower which would be slave labor. 3"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"130 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper The Federal Bank (which is not a FEDERAL bank) would be responsible for regulation of withdrawal of currency. The G.S.A. (General Services Administration) would be responsible for confiscation of pr ivate property for government use. Health, Education and Welfare would be responsible fo r nationalization of education (which the Department of Education has already done ), health services, hospitals and mental institutions. The Labor Department would be responsible for recruiting manpower; selecting manpower; referring manpower; and allocating manpower so each particular person that was registered at the post office in this national registration would be told where he (or she) was going to work. H. U.D. (Housing and Urban Debvelopment) would be responsible for transfer of persons to temporary or permanent housing in regional emergency planning and cooperation. The Trans portation Department is responsible for emergency enforcement and control and movement of passengers and the emergency operation of the Alaska railroad. There are two specific agencies here that we need to look at and to keep in mind. They are: H.E.W. and Justice (Department), as those two agencies are related to the Department of Defense; The various military departments are part of the Department of Defense. Under it, we have the Secretary of Army, Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff of Personnel and law enforcement, U.S. Army's forces command, and continental Army Reserve & National Guarkd. And under that we have the four armies dividing up the United States. Under the Fifth Army we have the provost marshal, who is directly connecte d to the Deputy Chief of Staff for law enforcement personnel. Under the provost ma rshal for the Fifth Army we have the 300 Military Police Prisoner-of-War (P OW) Command at Livonia, Michigan. At this point I quote from retired Ad m. Elmo Zumwalt's book, ON WATCH, Kissinger states, \"I believe the American people lack the will to do the things necessary to achieve parity and to maintain maritime superiority. I believe we must get the best deal we can in our negotiations before the United States and the Soviets both perceive these changes and the balance t hat occurs. When these perceptions ara in agreement, and both sides know the U.S. is inferior, we must have gotten the best deal we can. Americans at that time w ill not be happy that I have settled for second, but it will be too late.\" Zumwalt said, \"Then why not take it to the American people? They will not accept the decision to become second best while we are in a position of Gross National Product twice that of the U.S.S.R.\" Kissinger responds, \"That's a question of judgement. I judge that we will not get their support, and if we seek it and tell that fact, as we would have to, we would loose our negotiating leverage with the Soviets.\" Zumwalt stated, \"But isn't that the ultimate immorality in a democracy; to make a decision for the people of such importance without consulting them?' Kissinger stated, \"Perhaps, but I doubt t hat there are 1 million who could even understand the issue.\" Zumwalt responded, \"Even if that pres umtion is correct, those 1 million can 4"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 131 influence the opinions of the majority of the people. I believe it is my duty to take the other course.\" Kissinger responded, \"You should take care, lest your words result in a reduction in the Navy budget.\" So we see what the intention of the State Department is regarding the People. Another fact: On December 30, 1975, the California National Guard announced in a press release (which I have) that the stat e's Military Police battalions were organized and trained to provide immedi ate response to virtually every civil and man-made disaster, as well as to assi st law enforcement officers in emergency situations; to carry out their law enforcement as well as their military mission. When I asked four of the defendants in this case for their mission statement they did not provide it - although they say it is public information. The training spoken of for the California National Guard covers such subjects as dealing with individual civilians/civil population, det ention procedures, citizen's rights, and similar matters. And you know as well as I do that, when there is Martial Law, or Martial Rule, citizens have no right s - because the Constitution is pre-empted. Even the uniforms of the National Guards who participate in this program are different from the regular uniforms. Army spokesman will not reveal more about the uniforms. But the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department para-military units, who have received this training also, have army fatigues dyed black for their uniforms. A further fact is the disaster preparedness plan for the Marine Corp Supply Center in Barstow, California. Quoting fr om that document\" \"Under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, the preservation of law and order is the responsibility of local and state government. And the authority to maintain the peace and enforce the law is invested in the aut horities of those goverments.\" There are specific exemptions to the above concept. One of these pertains to federal intervention to civil disturbances in certain situat ions. Military commanders are deemed to have the inherent authority to take any measur e reasonably necessary for the protection of life and property in the event of a sudden unexpected public calamity which dirupts the normal process of government and presents an emergency so eminent as to make it dangerous to await instructions from appr opriate authorities. This includes Law Enforcement duties. The manual mentions something called \"Garden Plot Forces,\" which we will discuss at length in a few minutes. Don Bell (who writes a weekly report) reported on July 25, 1975, that in May of 1975, the 303 Civil Affaires group of the U.S. Army Reserves in Kearny, New Jersey, conducted an exercise to sharpen pl ans for a military takeover of the state government in New Jersey. According to Co lonel Frances Clark, they had conducted similar studies on how to seize municipa l and county government over the past few years. But this was the first time they had studied STATE government. Such units were trained during World War II to operate captured governments in the foreign. We never had federal troops trining to take over governments in the United States. When local violence or catastrophe struck, the National Guard - under command of the governor - went into action. This is def initely not the situation at this time ............................. Controlling the Masses 5"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper On February 16, 1975, in the SAN GABRIEL VALLEY TRIBUNE, it was reported that the L.E.A.A. (funded by the Department of Justice) and the Police Foundation (funded by the Ford Foundation) are prime movers toward implementing a national police force. Each, however, contends they support local police agencies. The total program invoices military units that hav e the function of taking over the admini- stration of local and state governments. That program is \"Operation Cable Splicer\" - by Army civil affairs groups, a sub-plan of \"Operation Garden Plot\" (the Martial Law program). The method by which the national police concept is being presented to the public has changed. It was first dis guised under the cover of protection against civil disturbances. This program was as follows: A. Keep the people from gathering in the streets. B. Isolate and neutralize the revolution's leadership. G Dispersal of crowds and demonstrators. This is followed by successful prosecut ion in order to: (1) Validate the action of police; (2) Denying the arrestees propaganda materials; and (3) Denying them the opportunity to recover money damages against the police for arresting them. Let me quote for you the scenario which was developed for Cable Splicer One, Two and Three, to justify the needs for dea ling with civil disturbances: \"Phase One: an arrest and shooting provoke crowd unrest and threats against public officials and a riot begins to form. Phase Two: police vehicles are ambushed, various attempted assasinations of public officials occur, des truction and raiding of armories occur, and thousands of people begin to gather and loca l police loose control. Phase Three: increased movement of rioters and the crow ds must be dispursed before they become sympathetic with the rioters. The National Guard and the local police loose control.\" This scenario provides for an orderly tr ansition from state to federal control. The Deputy Attorney General of California commented, at a Cable Splicer Three conference, that anyone who attacks t he State - even verbally - becomes a revolutionary and an enemy by definition. They are the enemy and must be destroyed. This program was taught in almost every state west of the Mississippi River and included as participants local active military, reserve military, and civilian police. The course name was \"Civil Emergency M anagement Course\". The official explanation that was to be given, if any questions were asked about the program, was: \"This activity is a continuous, joint law enf orcement-military liaison effort and a continuation of coordinati on established last year.\" In 1976, the OAKLAND TRIBUNE carried the most complete explanation of what is planned. It is reported in it entirety in the NATIONAL CHRONICLE which added an analysis to the story. (The OAKLAND TRIBUNE'S editor died suddenly after the story was published.) And, I quote: Last Saturday the California National Guard unveiled a new Law Enforcement Assistance Force - L.E.A.F., a specially trained and 6"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Capter Sx H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 133 outfitted Military Police unit, whose members will serve as shock -troups in the state's war agai nst political protesters and demonstrators. I saw a full-dress exhibition of what the California National Guard has planned for the next American revolution. Helicopters, SWAT teams, civilian military policemen in jack boots and helmets, twelve-guage shotguns, .38 and .45 caliber pistol s, radios, walkie talkies, and electrically-controlled intelli gence centers wired for instant communications with any police force in the state. L.E.A.F. is a 1000-member unit put together this year to handle unique law enforcement problems, such as mass civil disobedience, protest demonstrations and riots. In othe r words, breaking heads and taking names. L.E.A.F. has the support of Governor Brown, a quarter-million dollard worth of grants from the federal government, and no public opposition from civil liberties groups. For all its ineptitude, however, L.E.A.F. has a frightening possibility from a civil liberty standpoint. It is a direct product of the California \"Cable Splicer\" conferences - a series of high-level secret meetings between government officials, lawy nforcement officers, and military planners held during the late '60s and early '70s. The meetings were held as late as 1975, so far as many public records show. These were the conferences which COUNTER- SPY magazine had identified as California's \"Garden Plot Sub-Plan:. Gary Davis, Governor Brown's righthand man, says L.E.A.F. is to assist civil police not to replace them. Gary says, \"Civilians could expect a civilian type law enforcement rather than what is commonly known as Martial Law.\" Despite this assurance, L.E.A.F.'s exercises look disturbingly like the militar y coup described in the novel, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY. L.E.A.F. soldiers with nightsticks sood at intersections, stopping cars with suspicious occupants, checking I.D. cards and generally intimidating onlookers with their SWAT style uni forms, their sidearms and helmets. Perhaps more ominously, several participants in the role-playing exercises Saturday admitted that, even under simulated pressure, there has already been a number of incidents where the L.E.A.F. troops used excessive force to quell dist urbances - even though their orders forbade it.\" (End of quote.) Former L.E.A.FA administrator, Charles Rosgovin, is on record as having stated that local law enforcement has failed and must be replaced by a national police force. Patrick Murphy, the administrator of the Police Foundation, states, \"I have no fear of a national police force. Our 40,000 police departments are not sacred.\" Ex Attorney General, William Saxby, warned that, if we can go on as we are, crime will invade us and the national police will take over. 7"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper For the policemen who do not cooperate and still want to be policemen, there is the program of Contemporary Research, Inc. - and organization of psychologists, sociologists, education spec ialists and economic experts - who work toward a solution of many of today's social problems. The same organization develops specialized computer programming for the new world-wide military command and control system, as well as computer base systems for law enforcement agencies at all levels of government. The L.E.A.A. alone will receive over a billion dollars a year over the next 4 years - even though it has been ineffective agains t crime. This is because the L.E.A.A. is not geared to fighting crime; it's geared to developing a system for takeover of the United States with the assistance of the Department of Defence. The Planned Police State One of the programs the L.E.A.A. works on in its fight against crime is psycho- surgery. If you don't cooperate with their programs, you are merely operated on so that you be as cooperative as an adding ma chine. Or, the L.E.A.A. supports drug research for the same purpose - to neutra lize neurological sources of violence. Hence, as an example, if a law were passed whereby the ownership of firearms was declared to be illegal, you would be placed in one of these programs if you did not cooperate. The L.E.A.A. control exercise (at the state' s level) is from the Office of Criminal Justice Planning of the Governor's Office. Here in Texas, Mr. Robert C. Flowers is still the executive director in that o ffice. But all states have that particular department. In May 1975, the L.E.A.A. NEWSLETTER describes the function of one of its organizations: the National Institute of Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice. This organization funds something called the \"Uni ted Nations Clearinghouse\" in Rome, Italy. The function of that organization is, among other things, the exchange of Criminal Justice System information with the Soviet Union. And it goes without saying that we have nothing to learn from the Criminal Just ice System of the Soviet Unition. These incredible projects are being funded with our tax dollars. The code name for these projects ar e: \"Garden Plot\" and \"Cable Splicer\". Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government. An investigation was completed in November 1975 by 4 sources: the Conservative publication AMERICAN CHA LLENGE; the leftist NEW TIMES; the foundation financed FUND FOR INVESTIGAT IVE JOURNALISM; and Don Wood of the trustworthy OZARK SUNBEAM. It involves the potential creation of a Police State through the use of the Pentagon and its computerized intelligence dossier (lodged in the Pentagon basement) of thousands of citiaens by the National Guard, state and local police departments, the L.E.A.A., plain-clot hes military forces, SWAT teams, and the Department of Justice. 8"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 135 Brig.

In the event inquiries are received regarding this exercise, the response should be lim ited to identifying the activity as a continuous, joint law enforcement-military liaison effort and a continuation of coordination established last year.\" On page 6, security guidance is explained to the effect that if anybody asks any questions, limit the information that is given out on the basis of it being in the interest of \"national interest\" (security). Now, in the festivities celebrating the success of completion of the exercises, Gen. Stanly R. Larsen, the commanding general of the Si xth Army stated, \"The most serious challenge facing all of us will be the challenge of discharging our legitimate responsibilities. For a significant portion of a soiety at large is likely to regard us with suspicion and to question, even challenge our authority on the basic assumption of out profession. Part of this challenge we must be prepared to deal with; a potentially dangerous portion of our society which, in truth, could well become the domestic enemy. The manual includes instructions on operation of confinement facilities, handling and processing prisoners - including searching, transporting,, feeding, housing and handling of the special class of persons called \"detainees\". The plan also specifically includes a proposition for conf iscation of privately-owned weapons and ammunition. Files on Potential Prisoners The Army has over 350 separate record centers containing substantial information on civilian-political activities. Virtually every major Army unit has its own set aside from this. The Fifth Army of San Antonio has over 100,000 files of its own. The overall operation command post is a domestic room at the Pentagon. There are 25 million cards on individuals and 760.000 on organizations held by the Defense Central Index of investigations alone. An d this information includes political, sociological, economic and psychological pr ofiles. All this type of information on 25 million Americans. Since 1970, local county and state po lice forces all over the country have 9"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"136 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper undertaken crash programs to install vari ous kinds of computerized information systems. A large portion of this is bei ng paid for by the LE.A.A. Beginning in 1970, Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff order ed the destruction of all these data banks, but thev were not destroyed. All the outlawed collection is now located at Mt. Weather. Clark County. West Virginia and similar Pentagon facilities designed as adjuncts to the president's emergenc y powers under the Executive Orders. The cadre of specialized persons to enfor ce this plan are found in the U.S. Army Reserves-Military Police POW Command at Livonia, Michigan. Mr. Fennerin, of the 300th Military Police POW Command, at Li vonia, told me, when I called him from the Federal Information Center at Houston, that the camps in the Command were for foreign prisonsers-of-war and for \"enemies of the United States\". I asked him if enemies of the United States included U.S. ci tizens. He became angry, wouldn't deny it, and referred me to a very sinister individual at the Army Reserve facility here at Houston who I talked to; who explained to me that the prisoners were called \"inventory\" and \"internees\". He would not deny that the camps were for U.S. citizens. I called the Pentagon, spoke with the defendant there, and then with the provost marshal for the Fifth Army, and do you know what? Not one of these persons would deny that the system was for U.S. ci tizens. The provost ma rshal for the Fifth Army - when I mentioned the names of all the camp sites - said, \"Well at least you've got that right.\" The names of the detention facilities t hat I gave him were a list that I had acquired from the OZARK SUNBEAM. That list of names was the same list of facilities designated under the old Detention Act of 1950 as \"emergency detention centers\". But there is only one problem: That act was supposed to have been repealed in 1971. After some research, I found out what the problem was. One congressman - when the hearings were held for the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act - mentioned that there am 17 other bits of law that provided for the same thing. So it didn't matter whether they ever repealed the Emergency Detention Act. The public was in fact tricked by the Congress of the United States! Here are the designated sites: Tucked aw ay in the Appalachian Mountains of centeral Pennsylvania is a bustling town of approximately 10,000 people. Fifteen to twenty years ago it was a sleepy village of 400. Allanwood, Pennsylvania is linked to New York City by Interstate 80. It takes up approximately 400 acres and Is surrounded by a 10-foot barb-wire fence. It now holds approximately 300 minimum security prisoners to keep it in shape. It could hold 12.000 people from one day to the next. Thirty miles from Oklahoma City, on U.S.66, is El Reno, Oklahoma with an approximate population of 12,000. Due west, 6 miles from town, almost in sight of U.S.66, is a complex of buildings which could pass for a small school. However, the facility is overshadowed by a guard house which appears to be something like an airport control tower - except that it's manned by a vigilant, uniformed guard. This a federal prison camp or detention center. These camps are all located near super -highways or near railroad tracks or both. 10"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 137 The federal proson at Flor ence, Arizona could hold 3,500 prisoners. It is presently kept in condition by approximately 400 legally convicted prisoners. Wickenburg, Arizona is famous for its municipal airport, which was once government owned. It is now occupied by a private pa rty. It is rumored to be capable of being taken beck by the federal government without notice. Now there are a couple othe r of these facilities whic h are probably existing under the same arrangements. This particular rumor of instant taking back without notice has existed for about 9 or 10 years. T he only way it can actually be established is by looking at the local contract for the Wickenburg Municipal Airport itself, and the parties that have possession of it. As I mentioned previously, these names were ratified by the provost marshal of the Fifth Army, who is in charge of t he 300th Military Police POW Command. He is the one who verified them. He said, as I mentioned before, \"Well at least you've got that right.\" Some of the other locations are: Tule Lake, in California - now in private hands. It can be retaken without notice. Some of the others: we have Mill Point, West Virginia. I couldn't find a thing on Mill Point, but in that area we have all kinds of prisons. Among them are: Alderson, West Virginia, a woman's federal reformatory; Lewisburg, West Virginia, a federal prison; Greenville, South Carolina, in Greenville County, is now occupied by the State Yout hful Offenders Divisi on. Even that is a mystery to the people of the area. At Montgomery, Alabama, we have a fede ral civilian prison camp at Mazwell Air Force Base. Now does that sound right? There's one at Tuscon, Arizona, David Munson Air Base. In Alaska, we have Elmendorf at Eielson Air Force Base. And that brings us to a facility in Florida called Avon Park, Florida. I sent a representative to see what was at Avon Park. He found the Avon Park Bombing and Gunnery Range, which is also listed as the 56th Combat Support Squadron of the U.S. Air Force; which is also listed as the Av on Park Correctional Institute. No one is permitted entrance and probably there is no overfly permitted because it is a bombing and gunnery range. This was one of the places ratified by the provost marshal of the Fifth Army. In 1976, as well as on March 20, 1979, I went to the Sheriffs Dept in Houston to see if our local Sheriffs Dept had been infiltrated by these plans. Well, it appears so. I was put in contact with a Lt. Kiljan, who is in charge of some secret unit in the department. I asked him if he had participated in military training or in training with military personnel here in the Sheriff's Department. He denied it and, when I asked him if he would testify so under oath he be came angry and stated, \"You are just an ordinary citizen. I don't have to tell you anything.\" I later descovered that Lt. Kiljan is the ex-director of the Houston branch office of the U.S. Secret Service. Now where does his money come from? The area is administered by the Houston-Galveston Area Council. In this regional-government plan, eac h federal region is divided into state 11"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"138 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper clearinghouses, and each state clearinghouse is divided into area clearinghouses. And for our area we have the Houston-Galvest on Area Council. It serves as a conduit for federal funds in two major areas: L.E.A.A. and H.E.W. Most everbody thinks this organization (the Houston-Galveston Area Council) is for the development of the area - the geographical area here in Houston. But it is not. It is for the development of L.E.A.A. and H.E.W. projects. Now this finds its counterpart in every community across the U.S. It provides for these agencies a liaison for inter-governmental communi cations, interaction and coordination Mental Cooperation in Takeover Plans I examined their projects to see wh at they were doing. This regional- government program distributes federal funds for two major purposes: (1) Radio hookups between every police agency in the state to For Sam Houston: and (2) Mental health programs, including programs for the m entally ill having priority of beds and hospitals. Another interesting fact to consider is that in the Pine Bluff Arkansas Arsenal \"B-Z\" is stored. It's a nerve gas which cr eates sleepiness, dizziness, stupor, and the incapacity to move about. According to the Associated Press, the agent can be sprayed by aerosol, injected or sprayed over large areas by a bomb. The Military has admitted that one potential use of the gas is for civilian control. So, whatever they have planned, they've also planned a way for you to go to your destination in a tranquil state of mind. H.E.W., by law, is operated in conjuncti on with the United Nations through the World Health Organization. Back In 1948, the International Congress on Mental Health - a U.N. organization - declared in its pamphlet, MENTAL HEALTH AND WORLD CITIZENSHIP, that \"prejudice, hostility or excessive nationalism may become deeply imbedded in the developing personality without awareness on the part of the individual concerned. In order to be effective, efforts of changing individuals must be appropriate to the successive stages of the unfolding personality. While in case of a group of society, change will be strongly resisted unless an attitude of acceptance has first been engendered. \"Principles of mental health cannot be successfully furthered in any society unless there is progressive acceptance of the concept of world citizenship.\" the document states. \"Programs for social change to be effective require a joint effort of psychiatrists and social scientists, worki ng together in cooperation with statesmen, administrators and others in positions of responsibility.\" The three phases of the development are: (1) Mental hospitals for segregation, care and protection of persons of unsound mi nds; (2) Community Mental Health Care Centers, so that persons may be treated in their own neighborhoods; and (3) Child Care Centers for dealing with early diffi culties of nationalism in a child's life. Two years earlier, Maj. Gen. G.B. Chisholm, Deputy Minister of Health In 12"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 139 Canada - who later became director of Un ited Nations World Health Organization - explained, \"Self defense may involve a neurotic reaction when it means defending one's own excessive material wealth from others who are in great need. This attitude leads   to   war.\"   So his solution to the problem is: Let's redistribute the wealth among everyone. Further, the reinterpretation and ev entual eradication of the individual's concept of right and wrong - which has b een the basis of child training - are the belated objectives of practically all effect ive psychotherapies. Now, if we digress even further, to Buria (phonetic spelling), the director of the Soviet Secret Police, in the 1930s, we see that he explained the comm unist political strategy through the use of \"mental healings\" of psychiatry: \"Psycho-politics is the art and science of asserting and of maintaining a dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, bureaus, and masses. and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through mental healing. You must work,\" he stated, \"until every teacher of psychology unknowingly or knowlingly teaches only communistic doctrine under the guise of psychology.\" If you look at the Russian manual of instru ction of psycho-political warfare, we see in chapter 9, \"Psycho-political operat ions should at all times be alert to the oportunities to organize for the betterment of the community mental health centers.\" Now, under the new national Mental Health program at this moment there are more than 600 of these community mental health centers across the United States. The whole thing was promoted by Dr. Stanly F. Yolles, who was the director of the National Institute of Mental Health in 1969. And, he stated back then that the newest trend treating mental illness is care at local health care centers, where the patient is not Isolated from his (or her) family and friends. They have been working on this program for 46 years publicly and, now across the U.S. - through your tax dollars - you have 603 centers (to be exact); Communi ty Health Centers that are all part of this program. And this is how they are part of the program. (It has already happened): In the mid-1950s, there was set into motion an interesting chain of events. About 1956, the Alaska Mental Health Bill was proposed and later passed. It granted approximately $12 million and 1 million acres of public land to Alaska so that it could develop its own metnal health program. Now, this was a li ttle abnormal since Alaska only had a little over 400 people who were classified as mentally ill! After the bill was passed, Alaska passed its own, enabling legislation to get into the mental health business. They started by adopting the essential elements of the Public Health Service Draft Act on the hospi talization of the mentally ill in the old \"Interstate Compact on Mental Health\" - now called the Uniform Mental Health Act. There were no provisions for jury trial in it or anything else. You would just be picked up and taken to the Alaskan-Siberian Asylum - incommunicado - and the state would also confiscate all of your personal and real propertyl And they actually tried to do it as 1954 in the case of Ford vs. Milinak, which declared the act as adopted in another state (the state of Miss ouri) as unconstitutional. 13"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper But the act itself still exists - and modified - but essentially in the same form, the Uniform Mental Health Act, to which approximately 6 states subscribe. And, in passing month State Constitutions - if you w ill check them from t he period of 1935 - made a part of their constitution the practi ce of having a person submit to a 90-day mental examination to determine his (or her ) sanity, without any provisions for a trial by jury. This was part of the national program at that time. In this act, the governor could have an yone picked up and sent to the Mental Health Institution in Alaska or elsewhere. The results, as rumors, back in the 1950s, were that there was in fact a sinister , Frankenstein-type mental health prison in Alaska. I wrote to Alaska (the officials that is) and asked them for a description of the land of 1 million acres that they were elig ible to receive, under the Alaska Mental Health Act. And I also asked them for a copy of the inventory they ran for their facilities back at that same time. Well, so far no answer. And probably I will never receive an answer without a court order. But through the years, there was a spot in Alaska that was continually referred to: Southeast of Fairbanks; Southwest of Fairbanks; northwest of Fairbanks - somewhere near Fairbanks. Then I received information that a pilot had flown over the area once and had had his license revoked. And so, for $1.85 each, I ordered the low-level navigation maps from the federal government for Alaska and located the Alaska-Siberian Asylum for the treatment of enemies of the United States. It's right where rumor over the past 20 years had placed it: Southeast of Fairbanks. It stands out like a sore thumb! It's the only one of that geometric configuration within the state of Alaska, and you will note a black line running up through Fairbanks and down over near that area of the map. That is the railroad that the Department of Transportation would take the emergency operation of, under the Exec utive Order - if the Excecutive Order went into effect. And H.E.W. would be responsible for making a dermination of whether or not you were mentally disturbed because of your nationalistic tendencies, your love for the United States, or your adherenc e to any political or religious doctrine. But let's look a little further into the type of program that the L.E.A.A. Is paying for through the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Prisons - located in the back woods of North Carolina, near a tiny village called But ner - is constructing a mammoth 42-acre research complex for prisoners from throughout the East. Who will be sent for experiments to test new behaviorial programs and techniques? Target date for completion of the entire system is ironically 1984. And so, they're using right now, under the L.E.A.A. program, something called anectine. Punishment for troublesome behav ior within the prison Is being done by drugs and shock, likely to be the most se lected examples of programs that have made use of anectine - a derivative of South Amer ican curari. Anectine was originally used as a beginning factor to elec tro-convulsive shock. Such shocks applied to the head are so strong they can break and graze bones under the strain of resulting muscle contractions. Since anectine paralyzed the muscles without dampening consciousness or the ability to feel pain, by first injecti ng the inmates with it, researchers can turn up the voltage as high as they want without cracking the inmate's skeleton when his body is thrown into convulsions by the jolt. 14"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 141 What the anectine does, in short, is to simulate death within 30 to 40 seconds of injection. It brings on paralysis first, with the small rapidly moving muscles in the nose, fingers and eyes, and then in the diaphram and the cardiovascular system. As a result, the patient cannot move or breath and yet remains fully conscious, as though drowning and dying. This from t he 1974 publication, HUMAN BEHAVIOR. The People vs. the Conspirators The federal government answered my suit, in June (1976), by filing an unsworn general denial of everything that I had alleged. I spoke with the assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the case and asked hi m if he had gone to the trouble to call any of the parties mentioned in the suits - since I had provided not only the addresses, but their telephone numbers to provide a faster means of investigation. He said he had not. He had not even done a minimal amount of investigation of the case, but yet he filed a denial of my allegations. I filed a motion, in the me an time, to take the deposition of the person who writes the training programs for the conc entration cam guards, Mr. Richard Burrage - the 75th Maneuver Air Command at Army Reserve Center at Houston, Texas - stating the, in light of all the recent activity of government agents, one of the agencies involved might attempt to murder this key witness, the author of the training camp program. The federal judge denied my motion, stating that I had not quoted enough cases to him justifying my request. However, he was also aware that there were no cases existing on this set of facts but, as you will see as I go along with this report, he chose to ignore it. I then made an agreement with the assistant U.S. Attorney to take the deposition of Mr. Buirrage. After I'd m ade the arrangements, the U.S. Attorney refused to voluntarily go along with taking the deposition. It is very difficult to find justice in our system of courts. Law is usually practiced by the \"buddy system,\" hence the court rules are overlooked or not followed. On July 29, a hearing was held at the magistrate of Norman Black, U.S. District Court in Houston. The courtroom wa s completely filled wi th spectators. And although the news media had been contacted, no representatives of the press were there. There is a new media blackout on this matter here in Houston. Brief oral arguments were presented. T he U.S. Attorney explained that I was not the proper person to bring the suit because, although the free exercise of my constitutional rights was threatened by the concentration camp program, as alleged, it did not constitute my injury. The magistrate was impressed with the information I had thus far collected and stated that he would bring it to the att ention of the federal judge. The U.S. Attorney tried to have my investigation of the case halted, but the magistrate would not go along that far with a pre-arranged decision. As an additional indication of what I was up against, the original hearing was scheduled for 10:30 in the morning. However, the U.S. Attorney secretly had the time 15"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper changed to 2:30 in the afternoon. The magist rate gave the U.S. Attorney permission to file for motion to dismiss because he felt that the concentration camp program - to be used for persons who exercise their freedom of speech - did not present any injury. Now, on July 23, I had placed in the HOUSTON POST and in the HOUSTON CHRONICLE newspapers the following advertisement in the legal section: \"Solicitation for witnesses in Civil Action 78-H-667, Fede ral District Court of Houston, People Ex Rel. William Pabst vs. Gerald Ford et al . The action titled: Complaint Against the Concentration Camp Program of the Departme nt of Defense. Attention: If you have participated in Operation Garden Plot, Operation Cable Splic er, the 300th Military Police Prisoner of War Command, or the Ar my Reserve Civil Affairs group, you may be involved in a program that needs to be disclosed for this suit. To give your testimony call or write, (and here I placed my name, address and telephone number).\" As I previously mentioned, there is a ne ws media blackout on the story here in Houston. Both newspapers refused to carry the ad. First, at the HOUSTON POST, I had to threaten them with a law suit to carr y out the ad, even though I was paying for it. And then at the HOUSTON CHRONICLE, I had to meet with the president and various vice presidents because a refusal from that paper had come up from their own lawyers. Both nespapers finally carried it, but only after two days of complaining. The initial response of both papers was, \"W e don't carry stories like that\" and \"Don't you think that the people planning the concentration camps have our best interests in mind?\" As you will hear for yourselves, the policies definitely do not reflect our best interests. The next event that occurred was that the U.S. Attorney filed a \"Statement ot Authority,\" showing the reasons that he could find why I should not be allowed to take depositions to get more information from the person who was writing the concentration camp guard training program. However, his brief was completely filled with misquotes of the law from many ca ses. He would mention the case and then invent whatever the case should say. In my brief to the court, at this point, I notified the judge of the violation of the law requiring honesty in such matters. But the notification was ignored by the judge, who apparently sanctioned this most dishonest of acts commonly known as \"quoting out of context\". The Geneva Convention My brief was filed in August 31, formal arguments were set. The new courtroom of the magistrate was almost fi lled again. However, no one from the news media showed up for this hearing either. The few who were contacted had been told not to go; they would loose their jobs. At the hearing, I introduced evidence that heretofore had never been introduced in any court of law in the U.S. The U. S. Attorney had denied, you will remember, everything in my suit without so much as even a tiny investigation. So I introduced into evidence the following letter from t he Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff of Personnel, signed by one B. Sergeant, Col. G.S., Acting Director of Human Resources Development. 16"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 143 The letter states, \"On behalf of President Ford, I am replying to your letter 27 May, 1976, regarding a new article in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. As much as he would like to, the president cannot repl y personally to every communication he receives. Therefore, he has asked the departments and agencies of the federal government in thos instances where they have special knowledge or special authority underlogued. \"For this reason your communication was forwarded to officials of the Department of Defense. Within the Department of Defense, the Army is responsible for custody and treatment of enemy prisoners of war and civilian internees as defined under terms of the Geneva Convention of 1949. Therefore, the Army is prepared to detain prisoners of war and aetainees as defined in Article IV of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of pr isoners of war and protection of civilian persons. \"It is U.S. policy that its Armed Forces adhere to the provisions of international law to set the example for ot her countries of the world to follow and respecting the rights and dignity of those who become victim of international conflict. It should be noted that the Army program is designed for implementation during conditions of war between the U.S. and one or more foriegn countries. The Army had no plans nor does it maintain detention camp s to imprison American citizens during domestic crises.\" The problem with this letter is that it's not true, and that's why I'm going to discuss it at this point. First of all, in ve rifying the authenticity of the claims in the letter, l checked the Geneva text. There is no article in the Geneva Convention entitled as the letter states. There is, however, on each one of the classifications: \"Protection of War Victims/Civilian Persons\" and a separ ate article on \"Prisoners of War\". That was the first discrepancy. Then I turned to Article IV of the Geneva Convention. That article did not set up any requirements or authorizations for mili tary units of any type and does not even suggest it. Hence, the second discrepancy. The next problem with the letter from President Ford's representative is that it states that the prisoner of war guard program is set up for the implementation for \"conditions of war between the U.S. and one or more (foreign) countries.\" However, Article III of the Geneva Convention reads t hat the treaty applies to (and I am quoting) \"in case of an armed conflict, not of an international character, occurring within the territory of one of the high contracti ng parties.\" Obviously an armed conflict occurring within one's own territory did not mean between one or more of the parties to the treaty, especially if only one is invo lvedkkkk. Now, the examples of this type of conflict are: civil war, armed insurgency and guerilla activities. In other words, they're speaking of a domestic conflict. An even more shocking item is found in the last pages of the 1949 Geneva Convention under \"Protection of War Victim s/Civilian Persons\". You will find the index card, the identification card, forms to be used to writing your family, and i/"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper everything necessary for the administration of a concentration camp is contained in this treaty that the U.S. signed and ratified. Further, if there is a conflict in the U.S. involving only the U.S. this convention or treaty can go into operation - which includes the procedures for setting up the concentration camps. Article LXVIII of the Convention states (and I paraphrase): If you commit an offense that is soley intended to harm the occupying power, not harming the life or limb of members of the occupying power, but merely talking against such a force - such as Martial Law situation _ you can be imprisoned provided that the duration of such imprisonment is proportionate to the o ffense committed. Well, President Dwight Eisenhower didn't feel that provision wa s strong enough. So he had the following additions placed in the treaty which states: \"The U.S. reserves the right to impose the death penalty in accordance with the provisions of Article LXVIII without regard to whether the offenses referred to therein are punishable by death under the law of the occupied territory at the time the occupation begins..\" So not only can you be imprisoned for having exercised freedom of speech; you can be put to death under the provisions of the Geneva Convention in 1949 for having exercised, or attempting to exercise freedom of speech. The next item that I introduced into evidence was a field manual: FM 41-10, CIVIL AFFAIRS OPERATION. You will remember at the outset that I mentioned Civil Affairs groups. Let me quote to you from that manual what one of the functions of the Civil Affairs activities includes: \"Item 4. Assumption of full or partial executive, legislative and judicial authority over a country or area\". So let's see what a \"country or area\" is defined as in the same manual. It includes: \"small towns in rural areas, municipalities of various population si zes, districts, counties, provinces or states, regions of national government\". Nowhere in the manual does it exclude this program from being put into effect right here in the United States. As a matter of fact, in Kearny, New Jersey, the Civil Affairs group went into that area and practiced taking over that government unit. And yet the Army - in its letter of June 16 - states that these programs are not for us. Yet they are practiced here in the United States under conditions that can only occur here at home. The study outline of field manual, FM 41-10, on page j-24, under \"Penal Institutions 1-B,\" you see there is a pr ogram on concentration camps and labor camps - number, location and capacity. It is important to note that a concentration camp and labor camp are always located near eather other for obvious reasons. Again on page d-4 of the same manual, you'll find a sample receipt for seized property; a sample receipt written Englis h and containing terminology applicable to only U.S. territory. On page 8-2 of the same manual, under the heading \"Tables of Organization and Equipment,\" we find that there are 3 other organizations that would be working along with the Civil Affairs operation: the Chem ical Service Organization, the Composite Service Organization, and the Psychological O perations Organization, along with lh» various Civil Affairs organizations. 18"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 145 In July of that year (1976), the following Civil Affairs groups met with the following airborne groups at a staging area in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. A staging area is where military units meet before they go into action. They met with the 32nd Airborne and part of the 101st Airborne; the 321st Civil Affairs group of San Antonio, Texas headquarters; the 362nd Civil Affairs brigade from Dallas, Texas; the 431st Civil Affairs company from Little Rock, Arkansas headquarters; the 306th Civil Affairs group, and William Highlin. The 486th Civil Affairs company from Tilsa, Oklahoma; the 418th Civil Affairs company from Kansas City, Missouri; the 307th Civil Affairs group from St. Louis, Missou ri; the 490th Civil Affairs group from Abilene, Texas; the 413th company from Hammon, Louisiana; the 12th S.S. group, 2nd Battalion (headquarters unknown). They're ready to go into action. The problem is, as it appears, they were ready to lake over the entire government of the United States as their mission set out. One man who attended this staging area talked to a Civil Affairs Sgt. and asked him what his job was. The Sgt. explained that the civilians of this country will reaiiy be surprised some day when the Civil Affairs groups begin to operate the government. Now, the Department of the Army still ma intains that all this is not for the United States - yet this training continues here for us. The evidence is overwhelming; the plan exists for the impris onment of millions of U.S. citizens. And even though all this information was presented to the feder al magistrate, he still felt that no one was injured by such a plot. On the 2nd day of September, 1976, the magistrate recommended to the federal judge that the case be dismissed. And the sole basis for his reasoning to dismiss was that we have to be actually physically injured before we can maintain a law suit of this type. He did not feel that, although all this active planning, preparation and training was going on, that any U.S. citizen had been injured - even though the citizen may fear exercising his (or her) freedom for fear of being detained and imprisoned in a concentration camp at a later date. Ignoring the Constitution The case of Tatum vs. Laird, heard befor e the Supreme Court in 1974, is a case in point. It involved the Army intelligence collecting aparatus, which was developing a list of names of persons whom the Army felt were troublesome. The Supreme Court held that the making of list s of this type did not, of and by itself, present any injuries. The minority opinion in t hat case was that the injury, in the case with aprogram such as this made people af raid to use their freedom of speech for fear of being sent to jail for it. Bu t majority did not buy that argument. The difference between that case and this case - although we also have the computer program - is that we have someth ing much further past that point; the concentration camp guard program and t he Civil Affairs program for the taking over of all functions of our government. In light of that, the federal judge said that this is 19"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper not an injury. As a matter of fact, the U.S. Attorney alleged that even if people were placed in concentration camps, if they we re all treated the same thay would still not have the right to go to federal court. On the 20th day of September, I filed a memorandum to notify the magistrate and the federal judge that I had discovered that the federal government had a program for number of years to suspend our constitu tional right of the writ of habeas corpus. This information substantiated the complaint. Habeas corpus is the name of that legal instrument utilized to bring someone before a judge when that person is being illegally imprisoned or detained so that he (or she) may obtain his (or her) freedom. The Constitution slates that the writ of habeas corpus shall never be suspended. I found the disturbing information in a report: 94-755, 94th Congress, 2nd Session Senate, April 26, 1976, entitled \"Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans Book II.\" On page 17-d, entitl ed \"First Amendment Rights,\" the report states that more importantly \"the government surveillance activities in the aggregate, whether expressly intended to do so, to deter the exercise of First Amendment rights by American citizens who become aware of the government's domestic intelligence program.\" Beginning on page 54, it is stated that, beginning in 1946 - 4 years before the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 was passed - the FBI advised the Attorney General that it had secretly compiled a secret index of potentially dangerous persons. The Justice Department then made tentativ e plans for emergency detention based on suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Department officials deliberately avoided going to Congress. When the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 was passed, it did not authorize the suspens ion of the writ of habeas corpus. But shortly after passage of that act, accordi ng to a bureau document, Attorney General J.H. McGraf told the FBI to disregard it an d to proceed with the program as previously outlined. A few sentences later, on page 55, it st ates, \"With the security index, use broader standards to determine potential dangerousness than those described in the statute.\" And, unlike the act, Department pl ans provided for issuing a master search warrant and a master arrest warrant. This is the center importance; it is the same thing that I am alleging in federal court. And yet the magistrate chose to ignore these facts also. We have government officials not only i gnoring the will of Congress, but going the opposite of what the Constitution provi des by planning illegally for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. In addition, as mentioned before, the master search warrant and the master arrest warrant are forms fed into the computer, which print the names and addressses on them from the tapes previously prepared bv the intelligence-gathering program. As you are arrested, your home will be searched and anything found there may be confiscated.

This memorandum was filed on September 28 to make the court aware of the danger that our rights of freedom of speech and lawful assembly are in. But the cour, on September 30 - after this notificatio n was received - dismissed the case. However, in keeping with the practice of federal courts in Houston of actively participating in the obstruction of justice, I was not notified of the dismissal until the 6th of October - which gave me just 2 work ing days to submit any further motion in a 10-day period before time starts running for the appeal. What I have just said regarding the feder al courts in Houston is not only my opinion; the HOUSTON CHRONICAL, surprisingly, published an extensive document severely criticizing the federal courts in Houston for making up their own rules as they go along with the proceedings, as well as commenting on the communist-like Supreme Court attitude of the judges and the court personnel. My experience here has been that the court has returned to me almo st every document that I have filed. Then after a gib argument, they reaccept the document, stating that they just made a mistake. In reality, the power structure doesn't want these types of cases in any federal court. Summary of Evidence On the 8th of October, I had submitted a request for finding the facts in the filling which had been established by the evidence presented: 1. The 300th Military Police POW Command is located at Livonia, Michigan. 2. The Department of the Army has stated that said Command exists per se the Geneva Convention of 1949, a treaty of the U.S., Article IV thereof under the title relative to the treatment of prisoners of war and protection of civilian persons. 3. However, no such title exists in the Geneva Convention per se. 4. Nevertheless, there are separate titl es, one of which is: (a) Multilateral Protection of War Victims/Prisoners of War; (b) Multilateral Protection of War Victims/Civilian Persons. 5. Nevertheless, Article IV of both titles does not provide for the creation of any military programs for concentration camps. 6. Whether Mr. Fennerin, of the 300th Military Police POW Command, has stated that the purpose of the Command is for the detention of foreign prisoners of war and enemies the United States. 7. Further, Article III, concerning civilian persons, makes the treaty applicable to conflicts occurring soley within the territory of the United States that are not of an international character, wh ich is capable of including any type of conflict in its description whether it be civil war or guerilla activity or anything else. The text 21"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"148 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper states: \"In case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting pa rties, each party to a conflict shall be bound to apply to the minimum of the following provisions.\" 8. Department of the Army Field Manual FM 41-10, Civil Affairs Operations of Civil Affairs Organization lists, as one of its functions, the assumption of full or partial executive, legislat ive and judicial authority ov er a country or an area and there is no specific exclusion of the Un ited States as such a country or area. 9. Said manual defines country al ong certain geographical population basis, county, state regions and national government. 10. Said organization has, in fact, conduct ed practed takeovers of local and state governments in the continental United States, including, but not limited to the state of New Jersey. 11. Said organization includes in its study outline, on page j-24, a section on concentration camps and labor camps. 12. Said organization includes in its operat ions composite service operations and psychological operations organizations. 13. Said psychological operation, working wi th the U.S. Public Health Service, is prepared to operate any and/or all mental health facilities in the Unites States as tools of repression against outspoken but nonv iolent political conduct of the United States citizens in conjunction with all t he above, which is to be used for the same purpose. 14. Further, the Department of Justice, in conjunction with this program, has had plans for the suspension of writ of habeas corpus since the year of 1946; said plan depriving persons being detained under this to tal program any means for protection against tyrannical political repression. The plaintiff requested that the cour t make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law, consistent therewith, as shown by the evidence on record before the court. The effect of this request is that the case must go back to the district judge for further consideration. I mentioned t hat is appeared that all this planning for concentration camps was to be directed agai nst anyone, regardless of his polictical persuasion of ideology, who exercised freedom of speech against the established power structure of international bankers and multinational corporations. But, with Proposition 13-type movements threatening to reduce taxes throughout our nation. I foresee an activation of emergency programs so that the parasites on the federal take will continue to receive their checks. Price of Patriotism In the same Senate document, on intelligence activities on the rights of Americans referred to on pages 166 and 167, you will find that the federal 22"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Chapter Six H.R. 4079 & FEMA • 149 government has targeted its intelligence acti vities against one group of Americans. On page 166, the first classification listed is rightists and anti-communist groups. And the first group on page 167 on Army surveillance lists the John Birch Society as a number 1 and the Young Americans for Freedom as the number 2 target. Therefore, the groups of U.S. American citi zens considered to be the biggest enemy of the United States, by the federal government, at this time, is the conservative patriot, and those who assert the Constitution and individual rights. Although this information has been available since April of this year (1979), no one has mentioned this incredible discovery that the federal government considers the patriotic conservative as its greatest enemy. I have received all kinds of information regarding this case from all across the United States. Price of Apathy I obtained the 1945 report of the O.S.S. ( Office of Strategic Service) - the precursor of the C.I.A. - 7th Army, William W. Quin, Col. G.F.C.A.C. of the G2, on the liberation of Dachau, a concentration camp during the liberation in Germany. It contains much groups of information, but t he relevant portion of the report concerns itself with the section on the townspeople. Quoting from this report, on why the people of this little town didn't complain or didn't overthrow oppressors but just continued to go along and get along even though they lost their freedom in the process, it states: These words crop up and up again. They are the rationalization of a man who admits that he was a member of the Nazi party. 'I was forced to do so by business reasons,' they state. We were lied to in every respect but they admit they knew the camp existed. But they saw the work detail to the inmates passing throu gh the streets under guard and, in some instances, the S.S. behaved brutally even towards the townspeople. When asked if they realized that wi thin the last 3 months before the liberation 13,000 men lost their lives within stone's throw of where the people lived, they claimed they were shocked and surprised. When asked if they never saw transports of dead and dying pass through the streets along the railway, they referred only to the last one. They Insist that most of the trains came in at night and that they were sealed cars. Did they never ask what was in the endless procession of cars that came in full and always went out empty? A typical reply was, 'We were told it was all army material and booty from France.' It is established that anyone who stated that he saw only one train come In in the daytime was telling a flat lie. There are quite a few such people In Dachau. 23"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"150 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper The analysis of the anti-Na zi element of the town: (1) The people knew what was going on in the camp, even ten years prior to liberation; (2) The town did a thriving business from the concentration ca mp guard; (3) Ninety percent are guilty and have dabbed themselves with the blood of innocent human beings; (4) The people are to blame for their cowardice - they were all too cowardly. They didn't want to risk anything. And that was the way it was in all of Germany. So you can see how the whole program is related here. My lawsuit was against one single aspect of the total program: The enforcement arm of the conspiracy - the people who make up the cadre that is going to occupy the concentration camps where enemies of the United States will be placed. Remember Solzhenitsyn's words in the GULAG ARCHIPELAGO: \"Resistance should hav e began right there but it did not begin. You aren't gagged, you really can and you r eally ought to cry out that arrests are being made on the strength of false accusations. If many such outcries had been heard all over the city would arrests have no longer have been so easy.\" They, the tyrants, can't work in t he public eye. Those people who were so apathetic, hoping that nothing was really wrong, that nothing would happen to their persons and property, sat back and watched. The anarchists, financed by multinational interests, looted and pillaged their country. If you think that all (that) is necessary is to pay your house notes, to pay your TV notes, to go vote when there is an election, and to stand back during the rest of tht year and watch as your country and way of life are replaced by a system in which you will be a slave in a concentration camp, you - not the conspirators - are guilty because you, by silent acquiescence, invite tyranny and oppression. And, when you have to steal food to eat because our production is for foreign use because the Department of Commerce - through Executive Order 11490 and its predecessors - is responsible for internat ional distribution of our commodities, don't sit in a culvert hiding and eating and sonder ing what happened because you made it all possible. When your family is split up and spread across the United States to do slave labor and you never see yourloved ones again, it will be your fault because you did nothing to prevent it. And, once we loose our freedom, we are never going to regain it. That is why we must stand together to prevent the loss of our freedom as citizens of the United States. Thank you very much.

The act may be cited as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The follow- ing titles are contained within the act. Title I Coordination of National Drug Policy Title II Treatment and Prevention Programs Title III Drug Education Programs Title IV International Narcotics Control Title V User Accountability Title VI Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments Act of 1988 Title VII Death Penalty and Other Criminal and Law Enforcement Matters Title VIII Federal Alcohol Administration Title IX Miscellaneous Title X Supplemental Appropriations The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 can be found in most college or city libraries contained in the U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, Vol. 3,1988, with amendment and voting information in the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, Vol. XLIV, 1988. The law looks innocent enough upon first glance, containing new drug-awareness and treatment programs, more law enforcement and much stricter penalties — and all to be financed with a 2.1-BILLION-dollar budget. Upon close examination, howe ver, I discovered some really scary stuff tucked in where most citizens would never look. The act is some 366 pages of fine (v ery fine) print on very small pages. It is tedious reading, as is all legislation. In fact, it was impossible to read until Nancy Batchelder, a volunteer on my research staff, enlarged each page on a copy machine. Could it be that the Congress does not want the citizens to read the contents of their le gislation? I believe that is exactly the case. One of the most frightening aspects of this legislation was the pro- posal to allow evidence found in a warrantless search. Congress said \"illegally obtained evidence is legal to use in drug cases.\" Months later the Senate said no and that portion of the legislation was removed — or at least"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Chapter Seven Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 • 153 that is what we were meant to think. The act leaves a loophole for court decisions on some mass searches/ drug tests, such as school lockers, requirement for certain jobs, and an experimental program for those getting their first driver's license. (Sec. 9005) Key words here are \"mass searches/drug tests,\" \"jobs,\" and \"drivers license.\" The courts have held that if the citizens give up any right by giving what is called implied consent, then they no longer have claim to that right. The dangerous implication here is that \"mass search\" could mean the search of every person in, say , Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York City. Get the picture? The proposed legislation contained a section that if passed would have taken away our right to trial by jury, and specifically stated that you could be held guilty without trial. How could any citizen or Representa- tive or Senator even have had the gut s to propose such a thing for passage into law in this country? Fortunately, it was removed by amendment, HOWEVER IN SOME CASES A TRIAL ISN'T AUTOMATIC; YOU MUST REQUEST A HEARING.

Congress has asked for a study on the relationship between mental illness and substance abuse (Sec. 2071). Congress has recommended changes for involuntary commitment for mental illness which echoes the Russ ian NKGB model (Sec. 2072a). The secret power structure considers PATRIOTISM and NATIONALISM to be mental illness. Congress has asked for an evaluation of the appropriateness of ad- ministering health-service programs in conjunction with biomedical and behavioral research. IN OTHER WORDS, MIND CONTROL ON A GRAND SCALE (Sec. 2073a). The Congress ordered in this act that \"the Attorney General shall study the feasibility of prosecuting Fede ral drug-related offenses in a mat- ter alernative or supplemental to the current criminal justice system.\" THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A POLICE STATE (Sec. 6293). The act states that anyone with intent to obstruct or harass the harvest- ing of timber on public lands can get 1 year in jail or up to 10 years if the resultant damage exceeds $10,000.

This would be an interna tional data base to analyze currency transactions filed by member countries in order to monitor large ($10,000 or more) dollar transfers. To enc ourage \"teamwork\": Prohibit noncoopera- tive foreign countries from participating in any U.S. dollar clearing or wire-transfer system, or from mainta ining any financial accounts in the U.S. (Sec. 4701). The act gives the Secretary of th e Treasury power to require ANY transaction records from ANY domestic financial institution (even those not part of the bank/savings & loan system), as well as information on ALL of the persons involved. MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU PERSONALLY. This IS a police state (Sec. 6184/5326).

The purpose of the Special Committee is to recommend to the Chief Justice of the United States, who will forward the recommendation to the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, a proposal of a bill to modi fy Federal habeas corpus procedure. Quotes from P.L. 100-690: \"This bill to modify habeas corpus procedure must be reported with or without recommendation by the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate by the end of the 60th day of session after the submission of the report or the bill must be automatical ly placed on the appropriate calendar of the Senate. \"Once the habeas corpus bill is on the calendar, it is not debatable; it is not subject to a motion to postpone; reconsideration of the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order under this act.

It could establish the legal precedence for justification of a police state once the courts rule that the States have given up their right to jurisdiction under this act. Notice that it only involves crimes of a POLITICAL nature. Businesses are required to report all cash transactions of $10,000 or more (Sec. 7601 /60501-IRS). (It has been reported to me but not verified by me that this requirement has been lowered to $3000.) THIS HAS NOTH- ING TO DO WITH DRUGS BUT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE IRS. The act establishes a requirement to record and verify the I.D. of a purchaser of a money order or other fi nancial instrument of $3000 or more (Sec. 6184/5325). WHY? This is a big one. The act orders a study to be made on whether to withdraw $100 bills and $50 bills from circulation (Sec. 6187).

At some point before, during, or after every lecture, some well-mean ing but misguided soul, tells me that I have it all wrong and that it's the Je ws, the Catholics, the communists, or the bankers that are the ca use of all our ills. The target group is blamed for everything that has ever gone wrong. Power over everyone and every- thing is always attributed to this group — whichever group it happens to be at that moment to th at person. These poor people are on the right track, in that there has been and certainly is a conspiracy to bring about a totali- tarian world order. They are comple tely off track to think that any one ethnic, religious, or financial group alone could ever muster enough power to bring its plan to fruition. One gr oup, you see, would always be opposed by all of the other special-interest grou ps that exist and have always existed throughout history. That is, unless they were all really th e same group (the Illuminati) or for some reason they became unified (the Bilderberg Group). The one-group scenario, except for the Illuminati, has been used effec- tively to divert your attention away from the truth. It has caused you to fight each othe r in a manipulation that always leads th e REAL conspiracy closer to its ultimate goal, a New World Order. Those of you who believe that Hitler was financed by Jews so that he could murder Jews have a serious logic deficit. The fanatical le ftists who tout that it's Nazis behind the conspiracy have ignore d the fact that very w ealthy Jews are certainly involved, along with many Catholics, Pr otestants, communists, atheists, capitalists, Freemasons, etc., all of whom are diametrically opposed to each other, at least on the surface. Those on the right who believe that it is communist fo rget that U.S. bankers financed the creation of the Soviet Union. Financial assistance from MANY different countries, in stitutions, and peoples of opposing religious and political beliefs has b een the only thing that has kept the unworkable communist economy afloat for all of these years. The Rock- efeller family has a bank branch in the Kremlin. Those on the right must also ask why, whenever we have se t out to stop communism, the United States has only strengthened communism. No modern war, no matter what it was called, has ever resulted in territorial gain for the winner. It is not because our leaders are communi st, as claimed by the right. Com- munism was a creation meant to func tion as the antithesis to the United States. Many of our leaders, however, are Illuminati.

It is possible, however, that one or two or more of these reasons are not real, and thus manipulations. The evidence indicates that they are real and dangerous, each in its own way, and must be dealt with quickly and thoroughly. If it were secretly discovered that ex traterrestrial beings were visiting the earth it certainly would make sense to unite humanity against the possible threat that this would present. If extraterrestrials are not visiting earth, then it would make sense to invent them in order to convince opposing forces to unite against the threat. This has been done whether or not the alien beings in question exis t; however, there are more believable and more immediate dangers that may be the reason for an alliance of so many traditionally opposin g groups. Aliens will be discussed at length in a later chapter. The reason could be the threatened extinction of the human race by no other enemy than the human race itself. This threat may not be a manipu- lation; it may be real, and unless drastic measures are taken, may material- ize within the next one hundred years. Following World War II something happened that was to have tre- mendous significance for the future of all mankind. The intellectuals took note of this happening and brought it to the attention of the world power elite The elite were severely shaken by the predicted repercussions of this event. They were told that by or shortly after the year 2000 the total collapse of civilization as we know it and the possible extinction of the human race could occur. It could occur, that is, if we did not destroy the earth with nuclear weapons before then . They were told that the only things that could stop these predicted events would be severe cutbacks of the human population, the cessation or retardation of technological and economic growth, the elimination of meat in the human diet, strict control of future human reproduction, a total commitment to preserving the en- vironment, colonization of space, and a paradigm shift in the evolutionary consciousness of man. Those in power immediately formed an alliance and set about bring- ing the recommended changes to fruition through propaganda, mind con- trol and other manipulations of the masses. The Illuminati's prayers had been     answered.     What was this event that caused so much consternation and changed forever the future of the world? Mi llions of soldiers returned from war. The soldiers found lonely, eager women waiting for them. The greatest coupling in the history of the human race occurred.

It was"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper the great worldwide BABY BOOM. It was the culmination of all man's efforts to survive through history. It was modern medicine, better diets, heat in winter, pure running water, and proper disposal of sewage. It was the point in history when the birth rate so exceeded the death rate that the world's population doubled between 1957 and 1990. It was the most wonderful time in the history of the world, but it was also the worst. It signaled the end of man's most precious achievement. An alliance of all of the powers on earth, open and hidden, decided that individual freedoms could no longer be tolerated in the interest of the preservation of the human race. They believed the comm on man could not be trusted. What had been the unfulfilled dream of many individual groups became reality by the concentration of power in the alliance known as the Bilderberg Group. What had been impossible before was now promised The New World Order that so many had envisioned was now a certainty. The first study was made during World War II to determine the impact of the returning soldiers upon the economy. The results mobilized the ruling elite. A second secret study was conducted in 1957 by scientists meeting in Huntsville, Alabama. It confirmed the results of the first. The conclusion was that civilization as we know it would collapse shortly after the year 2000 unless the population was seriously curtailed. The study expressed a concern that since atomic weapons existed they would ul- timately be used. Total worldwide disarmament was urged. Congress adopted the disarmament plan and cr eated the U.S. Di sarmament Agency, President Dwight David Eisenhower had this to say in 1957: \"As a result of lowered infant mortality, longer lives, and the accelerating conquest of famine there is under way a population explosion so incredibly great that in little more than another generati on the population of the world is ex- pected to double.\" A third study was made by the Club of Rome ending in 1968 to determine the limits to growth. Th e result was the same. The Club of Rome was commissioned to develop a computer model of the world so as to predict the outcome of corrections made to social and economic struc- tures by the elect. The Club of Rome was also asked to develop a computer model of a New World Order. Both tasks were accomplished. Studies were done to determine a method to arrest the population explosion before the point of no re turn would be reached. It was deter- mined that an immediate attack on the problem would involve two points of intervention. The first was to lowe r the birth rate and the second was to increase the death rate. To lower the birth rate several programs were put into motion. The first was the development of positive birth-control methods using"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"ChapterNine Anatomy of an Alliance • 167 mechanical (diaphragm and condom), chemical (foam and birth-control pills), and medical (sterilization, a bortion, and hysterectomy) procedures. These were developed and implemen ted. The Women's Liberation move- ment was started with the demand for free abortions, usi ng \"pro choice\" as its rallying cry. Homosexuality was encouraged and Ga y Liberation was born. Homosexuals do not have children. Zero population growth became a hot subject at cocktail parties. Individual freedom, \"the heat of the moment,\" religion, and the old blue laws sabotaged these efforts, and while zero population growth became a reality in some areas, population in- creased rapidly in others. The only alternative left to the world' s ruling elite was to increase the death rate. This was a diffic ult thing to do, as no on e wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution. Neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enrage d public upon discove ring that they were being systematically murdered. Of course, a very short but very deadly global war using nuclear weapons upon select population con- centrations was contemplated and, to tell you the truth, wa s not ruled out. The fact that such a po pulation control was even contemplated confirmed the worst fears of those who had participated in the 1957 study. War was put on the back burner to simmer, but may become a reality. In the meantime something else had to be done that would absolve the decision makers of guilt and place the blame on those who di d not lead clean lives. Something that could be blamed up on Mother Nature. What was needed was the bubonic plague or some other horrible but natural disease. The answer  came  from  Rome.  Several Top Secret recommendations were made by Dr. Aurelio Peccei of the Club of Rome. He advocated that a plague be introduced that would havhe same effect as the famous Black Death of history. The chief recommendation was to develop a micr obe which would attack the auto- immune system and thus render the development of a va ccine impossible. The orders were given to develop the micr obe and to develop a prophylac- tic and a cure. The microbe would be used against the general population and would be introduced by vaccine. Th e prophylactic was to be used by the rulling elite. The cure will be admini stered to the survivors when it is decided that enough people have die d. The cure will be announced as newly developed when in fact it has existed from the be ginning. This plan is a part of Global 20 00. The prophylactic and the cure are suppressed. \"Man has skyrocketed from a defe nsive position, larg ely subordinated to Nature's alternatives, to a new an d dominant one.

Having penetrated a number of the erst- while mysteries and being able to sway events massively, he is now vested with unprecedented, trem endous responsibilities a nd thrown into the new role of moderator of li fe on the planet — incl uding his own.\" The above words were written by Dr. Aurelio P eccei and are taken verbatim from page 607 of The Global 2000 Report to the President. Funding was obtained from the U.S. Congress under H.B. 15090 (1969), where $10 million was given to the DOD's 1970 budget. Testimony before the Senate Committee revealed that they intended to produce \"a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired. Within the next 5 to 10 years it would probably be possible to make a new infective microor- ganism which could differ in certain important aspect s from any known disease-causing organisms. Most impor tant of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.\" Sir Julian Huxley said, \"Overpopula tion is, in my opinion, the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.\" The project, called MK-NAOMI, was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Since large populations were to be decimated, th e ruling elite decided to target the \"undesirable\" elements of society. Specifically targeted were the black, Hispanic, and homosexual populations. The poor homosexuals were encouraged on the one hand and scheduled for extinction on the other. The African continent was infected via smallpox vaccine in 1977. The vaccine was administered by the Worl d Health Organization. According to Dr. Robert Strecker, \"Without a cure the entire black popu lation of Africa will be dead within 15 years. Some countries are well beyond epidemic status.\" The U.S. population was infected in 1978 with the hepatitis B vaccine. Dr. Wolf Szmuness, the ex-roommate of Pope John Paul II, was the master- mind behind the November/78 to October/79 and March/80 to Octo- ber/81 experimental hepatitis B vaccine trials conducted by the Centers for Disease Control in New Yo rk, San Francisco and four other American cities.

Other measures were also ordered. The one you will be able to check the easiest is the Haig-Kissinger Depopulation Policy, which is administered by the State Department. This policy dictates that Third World nations take positive and effective steps to decrease their populations and hold them in check or they get no aid from the United States. If the Third World nations refuse, civil war usually breaks out and the rebels are usually found to be trained, armed, and financed by the Central Intelligence Agency. That is why many more civilians (especially young fe rtile females) than soldiers have been killed in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and other plac es. These wars have been instigated in Catholic countries by Jesuits (see Chapter 2). The Haig-Kissinger depopulation polic y has taken over various levels of government and is in fact determin ing U.S. foreign policy. The planning organization operates outside the White House and directs its entire efforts to reduce the world's population by 2 billion people through war, famine, disease, and any other means necessary. This group is the National Secur- ity Council's Ad Hoc Group on Population Policy. The policy planning staff is in the State Department's Offi ce of Population Affairs, established in 1975 by Henry Kissinger. This same group drafted the Global 2000 Report to the President that was given to Carter. Thomas Ferguson, the Latin American case officer for the State Department's Office of Population Affa irs (OPA) made the following state- ments: \"There is a single theme behind all our work; we must reduce population levels. Either they do it our way, through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we ha ve in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in Beirut. Population is a political probl em. Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it....The professionals,\" stated Ferguson, \"aren' t interested in lowering population for humanitarian reasons. That sounds nice. We look at resources and environmental constraints. We look at our strategic needs, and we say that this country must lower its population, or else we will have trouble. So steps are taken. El Salvador is an example where our failure to lower population by simple means has create d the basis for a national security crisis. The government of El Salvador failed to use our programs to lower their population. Now they get a civ il war because of it. There will be dislocation and food shortages. They still have too many people there. Civil wars are somewhat drawn-out ways to reduce population. The quickest way to reduce population is through famine, like in Africa or through DISEASE, like the Black Death, all of which MIGHT OCCUR in El Salvador.\" His budget for FY 1980 was $190 million; for FY 1981 it was"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"170 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper $220 million. The Global 2000 Report calls for doubling that figure. Henry Kissinger created th is group after discussion with leaders of the Club of Rome during the 1974 population conferences in Bucharest and Rome. The Club of Rome is contro lled by Europe's Black Nobility. Alexander Haig is a firm believer in population control. It was Haig that backed Kissinger and pushed the OPA into action. Ferguson said, \"We will go into a country and say, here is your god- damn development plan. Throw it ou t the window. Star t looking at the size of your population and figure out wh at must be done to reduce it. If you don't like that, if you don't want to choose to do it through planning, then you'll have an El Salvador or an Iran, or wo rse, a Cambodia.\" The real reason the Shah of Iran was overthrown was that his best efforts to institute \"clean programs\" of birth control failed to make a significant dent in the co untry's birth rate. The prom ise of jobs, through an ambitious industrialization program, en couraged migration toward over- crowded cities like Teheran. Under Ay atollah Khomeini, the clean prog- rams have been dismantled. The g overnment may make progress because it has a program \"to induce up to half of Teheran's 6 million residents to relocate. Iran's war with Iraq rea lly pleased the OPA.\" Now you know about the Shah and now you know part of the reason we have troops in the Middle East. Marcos fell vi ctim to the same policy. Daniel B. Luten had this to say: \"...an organization cannot have a conservation policy with out having a population polic y....the sanity test — in which the candidate, confronted with an overflowing si nk, is classified according to whether he reaches for the mop or the faucet.\" Thousands of people, mostly civilians, are killed in El Salvador's civil war each year. \"To accomplish what th e State Department deems adequate 'population control,' the civil war w ould have to be greatly expanded,\" according to Thomas Ferguson, the Latin American case officer for the OPA. El Salvador was target ed for population contro l and war in an April 1980 population report published by the National Security Council. \"El Salvador is an example of a countr y with serious population and political problems,\" the report states. \"Rapid population growth — the birth rate has remained unchanged in recent years — aggravat es its population den- sity, which is already the highest on mainland Latin America. While a population program exists on paper, it has not been pursued with a strong commitment, and contraceptives remain unavailable.\" The population program \"really did not work,\" OPA's Ferguson said. 'The infrastrucure was not there to support it. There we re just too many goddamn people. If you want to control a country, you ha ve to keep the population down.

The birth rate is 3.3 percent — one of the highest in the world. Its population, he complained, will double in 21 years. \"The civil war can help things, but it would have to be greatly expanded.\" In making sure that the population falls in El Salvador, Ferguson said, the OPA has learned a lot from its expe riences in Vietnam. \"We studied the thing. That area was also overpopulated and a problem. We thought that the war would lower population a nd we were wrong.\" Now you know what we were really doing in Vietnam and why we were not allowed to win According to Ferguson, the population in Vietnam increased during the war, despite U.S. use of defoliation and a combat strategy that en- couraged civilian casualties. Now you know why those of us in the know consider Lt. Calley to be a scapegoat. To reduce population \"quickly,\" said Ferguson \"you have to pull all the males into the fighting and kill si gnificant numbers of fertile, child- bearing age females.\" He criticized th e current civil war in El Salvador: \"You are killing a small number of male s and not enough fertile females to do the job on the population. If the war went on 30 to 40 years like this, then you might accomplish something. Unfortunately, we don't have too many instances like that to study.\" To aid you in your research of this travesty, the names of the significant reports are THE POPULATION BOMB by DR. PAUL R. EHRLICH (his wife Anne is a member of the Club of Rome), THE GLOBAL 2000 REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT, and THE LIMITS TO GROWTH, A REPORT FOR THE CLUB OF ROME'S PROJECT ON THE PREDICAMENT OF MANKIND. In April 1968 the study began publicly in the Academia dei Lincei in Rome, Italy. The study had been ongoing in secret ever since the initial findings of the Huntsville meeting of 1957. They met at the instigation of Dr. Aurelio Peccei. The first real public indication of their findings and the solution that had been decided upon was publication of the book The Population Bomb in May 1968. Notice how close the dates are. On page 17 of The Population Bomb, a telling paragraph reveals all there is to know. \"In summary, the world's population will continue to grow as long as the birth rate exceeds the death rate; it's as simple as that. When it stops growing or starts to shrink, it will mean that either the birth rate has gone down the death rate has gone up or a combination of the two. Basically, then, there are only two kinds of solutions to the population problem. One is a 'birth rate solution,' in which we find ways to lower the birth rate. The other is a 'death rate solution,' in wh ich ways to raise the death rate — war, famine, pestilence — find us.

Dr. Peccei was considered a hero for deciding to take the same risk as the general population. The publ ic results of the study were published in 1968 and again in 1972.

Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations made this statement: \"I do not wish to seem overdrama tic, but I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary General, that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply the required momentum to development efforts. If such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control.\" MK-NAOMI was developed by the Special Operations Division (SOD) scientists at Ft.

The time is ri pe, even dangerously overripe, as far as the population control problem is concer ned. We shall have to face up or ultimately perish, and what a dreary, stupid, unlovely way to perish, on a ruined globe stripped of its primeval beauty.\" Many other population controls have been promulgated. The reduc- tion of the world's population to workab le levels has been virtually as- sured. It is only a matter of time. The problem will be to curtail further human reproduction beyond approved leve ls. To handle that problem the New World Order will adopt the Comm unist Chinese model of population control. It is the only population-control program that has ever worked. The old and infirm have been periodically murdered and couples are forbidden to have more than one chil d. Penalties are so severe that families in China with two children are extrem ely rare. Three-children families are nonexistent. A surprising byproduct is that Chinese children as a group are treated better than any other national grouping of children in the world, including the United States.

San Francisco is also one of the six known inoculation sites for the CIA Project MK-NAOMI (AIDS). The Bay area was headquarters for Dr. Timothy Leary, who intro- duced the drug culture to American youth under CIA Project MK-ULTRA. It is suspected that the San Franci sco Bay area was also subjected to large doses of radiation to test the effects upon a population over a pro- longed period of time.

No one will be allowed to have a child without permission; stiff penalties wa it for those who ignore the law. The violent, the old, the infirm, the ha ndicapped, and the unproductive will be killed. Private property will be abolis hed. Since religion helped to create the population problem, it will not be tolerated except for the approved state-controlled religion which will evolve according to man's needs. Joseph Campbell explains this concept excellently in his series with Bill Movers called \"The Power of Myth.\" C ash will disappear and with it most crime will also disappear; but total control of each individual will be the price we pay. Man cannot be trusted to safeguard what little is left in the way of natural resources. Technological deve lopment and economic growth will be severely cut back. Man will be required to live like his ancestors. Those who learn to be self-sufficient and can adapt to the absence of many of the things that we take for granted today, such as automobiles, will get along fine. Others will suffer terribly. Man will once again conform to the law of the survival of the fittest. No one is going to like the loss of individual freedoms guaranteed us by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . I do not like or agree with what is planned. Intellectually I know that people will not solve the problems that we face unless they are made to do it. That is a sad commentary on the common man, but nevertheless it is true. The New World Order is evil but very much needed if man is to su rvive long enough to plant his seed amongst the stars. A paradigm shift and starseed are the only legitimate long-term answers. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ALL BEEN SO WRONG FOR SO LONG.

A paradigm shift in the evolutionary consciousness of man MUST take place. Right or wrong, the world is covered with agents of the Illuminati who are attempting to cause that evolutionary jump. We have not been taken into their confidence. As you learned in Chapter One, we have been judged too stupid to under- stand. It is true that without the population or the bomb problem the elect would use some other excuse to bring about the New World Order. They have plans to bring about things lik e earthquakes, war, the Messiah, an extra-terrestrial landing, and economic collapse. They might bring about all of these things just to make damn sure that it does work. They will do whatever is necessary to succeed. The Illuminati has all the bases covered and you are going to have to be on your toes to make it through the coming years. ACCORDING TO PLANS, MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE BETWEEN NOW AND THE YEAR 2,000; BUT IF THESE PLANS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL THE HUMAN RACE COULD BECOME EXTINCT. Nothing on earth can change this except a tremendous reduction and stabilization of the population. Without starseed th is reduction and stabili- zation would only delay the inevitable, as eventually all raw materials will be completely depleted. A never-ending source of free energy will then be needed. That may be possible but is unlikely to solve the problem. Without some central common need that would bind man together, a source of free energy would most likely result in total anarchy. So you see, what was needed in the beginning is still needed in the end. A paradigm shift in the evolutionary consciousness of man coupled with starseed is the most logical answer for the human race. We must learn to accept individual responsibility for the world's problems or be willing to live by the terms of those who do. We must learn to love one another, share, deplor e violence, and work with nature, not against it. We must do all of this while colonizing the Universe. We must be prepared in the process to peacefully meet and deal with an extrater- restrial intelligence. I believe they exist. Can you imagine what will happen if Los Angeles is hit with a 9.0 quake, New York City is destroyed by a terrorist-planted atomic bomb, World War III breaks out in the Middle East, the banks and the stock markets collapse, Extraterrestrials la nd on the White House lawn, food disappears from the markets, some people disappear, the Messiah presents himself to the world, and all in a very short period of time?

I had to eat humble pie when I read the following text entitled \"Les- sons from Lithuania'' by Neal Knox. It was contributed by a member of the Citizens Agency for Joint Intelligence . I was impressed by its simplicity and ability to deliver with very few words the precise message that I had intended to convey in twenty pages. Since I believe that sometimes less is more, and since my ego has nothing to do with this book and its message, \"Lessons from Lithuania\" has been printe d in its entirety, with no changes, as the complete chapter on the Second Amendment. Try as I might, I could never improve upon Neal's simple statement. My deepest appreciation to Neal Knox and The Firearms Coalition for permission to use \"Lessons from Lithuania.\" LESSONS FROM LITHUANIA by Neal Knox Those who avoid and evade the reas on for the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would surely admit that if Lithuania had a Second Amendment, Mikhail Gorbachev violated it on March 22,1990 — Russian troops seized arms from the Lithuanian militia. Or was \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" actually violated two days earlier, when Premier Gorbachev ordered private citizens to turn in their hunting and competition guns to the Russian army within one week \"for temporary safekeeping\" or have them confiscated and their owners imprisoned? Or was \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" initially violated many years before, when the people were first prohibited from possessing guns without permission of government a nd laws were passed requiring every gun to be registered? In fact, the Soviet Constitution guarantees the people the right to keep and bear arms, and Lithuania is part of the Soviet Union — or so Gorbachev contends. But obviously the Soviet government pays no more attention to that constitutional freedom guarantee than do the majority of the U.S. government, the In ternational Association of Chiefs of Police, or CBS and the Washington Post. What is the difference, precisely, between the confiscation of private firearms in Lithuania and the confisca- tion ordered by S. 166, the Graves bill now pending in the New Jersey Senate?

After reading the above, I hope you will agree with me that anyone who attempts to subvert the Second Amendment or any other section or legal amendment of the Constitu- tion is a traitor and should be arrested and tried for treason. I hope that you will copy this chapter and distribute it as widely as possible, to as many people as possible. Education is more than half the battle. In case you have not guessed by now, the fact that most Americans own at least one firearms weapon is the only thing that has kept the New World Order at bay. A Ray of Hope: As of January 8, 1 991, less than 10% of all California gun owners have registered their firearms. Many Californians stood in the streets with weapons in hand and publicly bur ned the registration forms. Network news did not cover these demonstrati ons, and no mention has been made on television that California gun owners ha ve ignored this unconstitutional gun- registration law."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 COUP DE GRACE High Crimes & Misdemeanors Treason Committed by the Joint Chiefs Phone Conversation w ith Randall Terpstra"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"184 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper BACKGROUND When I finished \"The Secret Government\" in May 1989, a temptation existed to remove the material that I had written on the Nixon resignation. I thought that no one would ever belie ve that a coup had occurred in the United States. Furthermore, I held no hope that anyone would ever step forward and substantiate my claim. I was wrong. People did believe it, and subsequent to my delivery of the paper on July 2, 1989, three in- dividuals have come forward to confir m that a coup did in fact take place. This chapter is the transcript of a phone conversation between me and one of those people, Randall Terpstra. The members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who were serving at the time of Nixon's resignation were asked if they had instructed their commands to ignore orders from the White House. They replied that the subject had come up but that it was not done. They lied. CONFIRMATION OF A COUP Randy: This is Randy. Bill: Hi, Randy? Randy:     Yes...     Bill: This is Bill Cooper. Randy: Hello, Bill. Bill: You left a message on my phone. I didn't get to hear it because my wife took the messages off the phone and wrote them down. I have no idea why you called.

When I was in the Navy, I was a radioman, and in the mid seventies — the ye ar escapes me at the moment, it's been a long time, I've only had your papers since last night - and I was involved in a joint Apollo-Soyuz moon shot. I was an onboard crypto operator, which basically meant that all message traffic of a certain nature, which was referred to as SPE CAT or special cate gory, was off-line encrypted. ed. During the Apollo-Soyuz shot we established what was referred to as a termination with an unknown location. That location identified itself only as MAJORITY CONTROL. Bill:     Okay...     Randy: All of the message traffic we sent to and from this location was off-line encrypted, which was rather odd because...First, let me explain it. In the Navy when you send a SPECAT, or Special Category message, you go into what's called a clean environm ent. The message is drafted by the originator or on a piece of paper. That piece of paper is brought directly to a designated SPECAT operator — some body who has a SPECAT or higher clearance — who enters that in the te letype on a paper tape with the hole punched in it for transmission. Bill:     Right.     [Randy did not know that one of my duties as the Petty Officer of the Watch in the CINCPACFLT Command Center was SPECAT operator for the Com- mand     Center.]     Randy: At that point the SPECAT operator goes onto the circuit, notifies the other end that he has SP ECAT traffic to transmit. The other end... an authorized SPECAT operator has to come on the circuit at the other end. He has to identify himself back to you with his SPECAT code number, his name and service number. Now, to me at this particular moment in time and space — this woul d be in the middle seventies — that was probably the most insulated me ans of transmitting information point to point in the military, because you knew who wrote the message, who had seen it to transmit, who had recei ved it, all the way to its ultimate Bill:   Uh   huh...   Randy: Well, in this particular case all of the message traffic was being handed to me and I was instructed to encode it through a machine called a KL-47, which takes standard text mate rial and turns it out into five-letter blocks - random characters. And the or igination...the y...there were five of us onboard the USS Mount Whitney, and the five of us were SPECAT operators. We were on a revolving shift all during the Apollo-Soyuz mission.

Every hour a Mr. Logan from NASA would come down to the room, punch in because it had a cipher lock on the door, look at any message traffic that came in, and then we would burn it, right in the room. He would draft his replies, which I would enter on the KL-47, take the tape, transmit it and then he would burn the outgoing messages as well. Bill:     Uhhuh.     [Note: The tape is made by the KL- 47. It is a paper tape containing the five-character grouping encryption. The tape is put onto a sprocket in the teletype machine and it automatically se nds the message to the addressee. It comes out at the other end in encrypted form and must be decoded. At least that is the way I was trained as designated SPECAT Operator to do it in the CINCPACFLT Command Center.] Randy: I don't remember a lot of what was sent because it was very, very busy times. We had so many civilians on board the ship that it was...an incredible amount of work going on. Bill: I can imagine. Randy: I do know that hourly we received a report from MAJORITY CONTROL that was headed — now, this is after I've decoded it...the head- ing was always MAJESTY ADVISORY, over and over and over again. Bill:     Okay.     [Note: MAJESTY ADVISORY messages we re sent by CINCPACTLT to update or inform the President personally of beginning, ending, or ongoing operations that could result in serious repercussions to the United States, i.e. the bombing of North Vietnam after the President had informed the American people that no more bombing would occur.] Randy: Now after doing this I was on for four hours, then off for four then on for four. We did a rollover lik e that for the whole Apollo-Soyuz mission. The other thing that I saw that tripped me off a little bit was the term \"IACs.\" Bill: Identified Alien Craft! Randy: They...that was never...they never spelled out the acronym. It was just IACs. Bill: Fantastic! Randy: It was recurring through all of this message traffic that I was sending. Bill: Randy, you are a godsend... Where have you been hiding all of these years?

They've si nce been used for all kinds of other things.

That's that rescue, the hostage rescue group, the Green Beret unit? Bill: Uh huh. Randy: Now, he originally wanted to call it something else, and the White House pushed DELTA FORCE down his throat. Bill: Do you know that I talked to Barbara Honegger? Have you read October Surprise? Randy: No, I haven't. As a matter of fact, I've got your bibliography here and I was about to make a ca ll to a friend of mine who runs a bookstore to place a rather large order. Bill: Okay, Barbara Honegger wrote October Surprise and they refused to print one chapter. I met her at one of the talks that I give and we got very embroiled in conversation.

So how in the hell did that helicopter catch fire right at the cockpit and outside of the cockpit, out on the fuselage? Bill: That's a good question. The alien beam weapons will do that though. Randy: Now ask a new question. Bill: Uh huh. Randy: The beam weapons you refer to, do they leave a pattern on the material, a wavy, ripply pattern? Bill: That I don't know. All I know a bout the beam weapons is this. That they are only effective at short range; that they can paralyze a human being; they can levitate a human being; they can burn something out of your hands without hurting you, like an M-16; and fry you to a crisp and nothing but ashes is left. It can give you a sunburn. It depends upon the degree of how they want to use this thing as to exactly what it will do That's what I remember, and that's what my research has also confirmed At Ellsworth Air Force Base, in fact, one airman security patrol en- countered an alien craft and aliens on the ground. He aimed his M-16 at them, and this weapon, this beam h it the M-16 and literally vaporized it. He had burns on his hands, but otherwise he was unhurt.

You've galvanized a lot of them, especially the text where you were talking about the sudden in flux of media and television on an alien presence among us in our society. I've felt that for almost two years, and I could never really verbalize it.

The President is called MAJESTY in connection wi th these things. What you were getting, the MAJESTY advisory messages, were to keep the President updated. Randy: You know, the real funny part about all of that is the guy who would come in and was using our facility. His name was Logan, Mr. Logan. His title was supposed to be co mmunications coordinator, but I never seen him do a damn thing except come into that ro om, read traffic, draft a reply, and then go back up to CI C. Now, we were in what was called the GENSER, general service side of communications. We weren't the spooks. The spooks had thei r own little quarters over on the other side of the ship. Bill: Sure. Randy: But we did have the KL-47 and the rest of the NASA types. The civilian types would come down to — we ha d a message window in the hallway and they'd come up and they'd hand their outgoing messages in the window and they would go out on the general service circuits. The only stuff that we handled was the, was traffic for MAJORITY CONTROL with MAJESTY advisories and that was it . And a lot of it, like I said, was a lot of textual data. I mea n, there was tons of text, and it wa s all couched in techno-babble that I didn't really understand. But I do remember the acronym IACs everywhere. I mean completely repetitious. Bill: Oh yeah. Randy: You know, thaf s as much as I can offer you. Bill: Do you remember where the me ssages were sent for MAJORITY CONTROL? Randy: No. The locati on of MAJORITY CONTROL was never dis- closed. The only thing I can assume is that it was somewhere north. The ship was anchored — well, we weren't anchored, we were at what was called sea-anchor, which I am sure you are aware of. We were on an east-west axis so that all of our antennas could be brought to bear on the western horizon, because thaf s the way the spacecraft was coming around The antenna that was assigned to my circuit was an antenna called an RLPA or Rotating Log Periodic Antenna , which is a very, very directional antenna, and it was pointed north.

I originally wrote this piece as a research paper. It was first delivered at the MUFON Symposium on July 2,1989, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of this knowledge comes directly from, or is a result of my own research into the TOP SECRET/MAJIC material which I saw and read between the years 1970 and 1973 as a member of the Intelligence Briefing Team of the Com- mander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet. Since some of this information was derived from sources that I cannot di vulge for obvious reasons, and from published sources which I cannot vouch for, this chapter must be termed a hypothesis. I firmly believe that if aliens are real, this is the true nature of the Beast. It is the only scenario that has been able to bind all the diverse elements. It is the only scenario that answers all the questions and places the various fundamental mysteries in an arena that makes sense. It is the only explanation which shows the chronology of events and demonstrates that the chronologies, when assembled, match perfectly. The bulk of this I believe to be true if the material that I viewed in the Navy is authentic. As for the rest, I do not know, and that is why this paper must be termed a hypothesis. Most historic and current available evidence supports this hypothesis. THE SECRET GOVERNMENT During the years following World War II the government of the United States was confronted with a series of events which were to change beyond prediction its future and with it the fu ture of humanity. These events were so incredible that they defied belief. A stunned President Truman and his top military commanders found themselves virtually impotent after hav- ing just won the most devastating and costly war in history. The United States had developed, used, and was the only nation on earth in possession of the atomic bomb. This new weapon had the poten- tial to destroy any enemy, and even the Earth itself. At that time the United States had the best economy, the most advanced technology, the highest standard of living, exerted the most influence, and fielded the largest and most powerful military forces in hist ory. We can only imagine the con- fusion and concern when the informed elite of the United States Govern- ment discovered that an alien spacecraft piloted by insectlike beings from totally incomprehensible culture had crashed in the desert of New Mexico. Between January 1947 and December 1952 at least 16 crashed or downed alien craft, 65 alien bodies, a nd 1 live alien were recovered. An additional alien craft had exploded and nothing was recovered from that"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 197 incident. Of these events, 13 occurred within the borders of the United States, not including the craft which disintegrated in the air. Of these 13, 1 was in Arizona, 11 were in New Me xico, and 1 was in Nevada. Three occurred in foreign countries. Of those, 1 was in Norway and the last 2 were in Mexico. Sightings of UFOs were so numerous that serious inves- tigation and debunking of each report became impossible, utilizing the existing intelligence assets. An alien craft was found on February 13, 1948, on a mesa near Aztec, New Mexico. Another craft was located on March 25, 1948, in White Sands Proving Ground. It was 100 feet in diameter. A total of 17 alien bodies were recovered from those two crafts. Of even greater significance was the discovery of a large number of human body parts stored within both of these vehicles. A demon had reared its head and paranoia quickly took hold of everyone then \"in the know.\" Th e Secret lid immediately became a Top Secret lid and was screwed down tight. The security blanket was even tighter than that imposed upon the Manhattan Project. In the coming years these events were to become the most closely guarded secrets in the history of the world. A special group of America's top scientists were organized under the name Project SIGN in December 1947 to study the phenomenon. The whole nasty business was contained. Project SIGN evolved into Project GRUDGE in December 1948. A low-level collection and disinformation project named BLUE BOOK was formed under GRUDGE. Sixteen volumes were to come out of GRUDGE. \"Blue Teams\" were put together to recover the crashed disks and dead or live aliens. The Blue Teams were later to evolve into Alpha Teams under Project POUNCE. During these early years the United States Air Force and the Central intelligence Agency exercised complete control over the \"alien secret.\" In fact, the CIA was formed by Presi dential Executive Order first as the Central Intelligence Group for the express purpose of dealing with the alien presence. Later the National Security Act was passed, establishing it as the Central Intelligence Agency. The National Security Council was established to oversee the intel- ligence community and especially the alien endeavor. A series of National Security Council memos and Executive orders removed the CIA from the sole task of gathering foreign intellig ence and slowly but thoroughly \"leg- alized\" direct action in the form of covert activities at home and abroad. On December 9,1947, Truman approved issuance of NSC-4, entitled \"Coordination of Foreign Intelligence In formation Measures\" at the urging of Secretaries Marshall, Forrestal, Patte rson, and the director of the State Department's Policy Planni ng Staff, George Kennan."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"198 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper The Foreign and Military Intelligence, Book 1, \"Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operati ons with Respect to Intelligence Activities,\" United States Senate, 94th Congre ss, 2nd Session, Report No. 94-755, April 26,1 976, p. 49, states: \"This directive empowered the Secre- tary of State to coordi nate overseas information activities designed to counter communism.\" A Top Secret annex to NSC-4, NSC- 4A, instructed the director of Central Intelligence to undertake cove rt psychological activities in pursuit of the aims set forth in NSC-4. Th e initial authority given the CIA for covert operations under NSC-4A did not establish formal procedures for either coordinating or approving these operations. It simply directed the DCI to \"undertake covert actions and to ensure, through liaison with State and Defense, that the resulting operations were consistent with American policy.\" Later NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 were to supersede NSC-4 and NSC-4A and expand the covert abilities even fu rther. The Office of Policy Coordina- tion (OPC) was chartered to carry out an expanded program of covert activities. NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 valid ated illegal and extralegal prac- tices and procedures as being agreeabl e to the national security leadership. The reaction was swift. In the ey es of the intelligence community \"no holds were barred.\" Under NSC-10/ 1 an Executive Coordination Group was established to review, but not approve, covert project proposals. The ECG was secretly tasked to coordinate the alien projects. NSC-10/1 & /2 were interpreted to mean that no on e at the top want ed to know about anything until it was over and successful. These actions established a buffer between the President and the infor- mation. It was intended that this bu ffer serve as a mean s for the President to deny knowledge if leaks divulged the true state of affairs. This buffer was used in later years fo r the purpose of effectively isolating succeeding Presidents from any knowledge of th e alien presence other than what the Secret Government and the intelligence community wanted them to know. NSC-10/2 established a study panel which met se cretly and was made up of the scientific minds of the day. The study panel was not called MJ-12. Another NSC memo, NSC-10/5 further outlined the duties of the study panel. These NSC memos and secret Ex ecutive orders set the stage for the creation of MJ-12 only four years later. Secretary of Defense James Forresta l objected to the secrecy. He was a very idealistic and religi ous man. He believed that the public should be told. James Forrestal was also one of the first known abductees. When he began to talk to leaders of the oppos ition party and leaders of the Congress about the alien problem he was asked to resign by Truman. He expressed"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 199 his fears to many people. Rightfully, he believed that he was being watched. This was interpreted by tho se who were ignorant of the facts as paranoia. Forrestal later was said to have suffered a mental breakdown. He was ordered to the mental ward of Bethesda Naval Hospital. In spite of the fact that the Administration had no authority to have him committed, the order was carried out. In fact, it was feared that Forrestal would begin to talk again. He had to be isolated and discredited. His family and friends were denied permission to visit. Finally, on May 21, 1949, Forrestal's brother made a fateful decision. He notified authorities that he intended to remove James from Bethesda on May 22. Sometime in the early morning of May 22,1949, agents of the CIA tied a sheet around James Forrestal's neck, fastened the other end to a fixture in his room, then threw James Forrestal out the window. The sheet tore and he plummeted to his death. James Forrestal's secret diaries were confiscated by the CIA and were kept in the White House for many years. Due to public demand the diaries were eventually rewritten and published in a sanitized version. The real diary information was later furnished by the CIA in book form to an agent who published the material as fiction. The name of the agent is Whitley Strieber and the book is Majestic. James Forrestal became one of the first victims of the cover-up. The live alien that had been found wandering in the desert from the 1949 Roswell crash was named EBE. The name had been suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush and was short for Extraterrestrial Biological Entity. EBE had a tendency to lie, and for over a year would give only the desired answer to questions asked. Those ques tions which would have resulted in an undesirable answer went unanswered. At some point during the second year of captivity he began to open up. The information derived from EBE was startling, to say the least. This compilation of his revelations became the foundation of what would later be called the \"Yellow Book.\" Photographs were taken of EBE which, among others, I was to view years later  Project  Grudge.   In late 1951 EBE became ill. Me dical personnel had been unable to determine the cause of EBE's illness and had no background from which to draw. EBE's system was chlorophyll-b ased and he processed food into energy much the same as plants. Wast e material was excreted the same as plants. Several experts were called in to study the illness. These specialists included medical doctors, botanists, and entomologists. A botanist, Dr. Guillermo Mendoza, was brought in to try and help him recover. Dr. Mendoza worked to save EBE until June 2, 1952, when EBE died. Dr. Mendoza became the expert on at least this type alien of biology. The movie E.T. is the thinly disguised story of EBE."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"200 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper In a futile attempt to sa ve EBE and to gain favo r with this technologi- cally superior race, the United States began broadcasting a call for help early in 1952 into the vast regions of space. The call went unanswered but the project, dubbed SIGMA, contin ued as an effort of good faith. President Truman created the supers ecret National Security Agency (NSA) by secret Executive order on November 4,1 952. Its primary pur- pose was to deciphe r the alien communications, language, and establish a dialogue with the extraterrestrials. Th is most urgent task was a continua- tion of the earlier effort. The seconda ry purpose of the NSA was to monitor all communications and emissions fr om any and all electronic devices worldwide for the purpose of gath ering intelligence, both human and alien, and to contain the secret of the alien presence. Project SIGMA was successful. The NSA also maintains communica tions with the Luna base and other secret space progra ms. By executive order of the President, the NSA is exempt from all laws which do not specifically name the NSA in the text of the law as being subject to that law. That means that if the agency is not spelled out in the text of any and ev ery law passed by the Congress it is not subject to that or those laws. The NSA now performs many other duties and in fact is the premier agency w ithin the intelligence network. Today the NSA receives approximately 75% of the monies allotted to the intel- ligence community. The old saying \"where the money goes therein the power resides\" is true. The DCI today is a figurehead maintained as a public ruse. The primary task of the NS A is still alien communications, but now includes other extraterre strial projects as well. President Truman had been keeping our allies, including the Soviet Union, informed of the developing a lien problem. This had been done in case the aliens turned out to be a th reat to the human race. Plans were formulated to defend the Earth in case of invasion. Great difficulty was encountered in mamtaining internationa l secrecy. It was decided that an outside group was necessar y to coordinate and cont rol international efforts in order to hide the secr et from the normal scruti ny of govern ments by the press. The result was the formation of a secret ruling body which became known as the Bilderberg Group. The group was formed and met for the first time in 1952. They were named after the firs t publicly kno wn meeting place, the Bilderberg Hote l. That public meeting took place in 1954. They were nicknamed The Bilderbergers. The headquarters of this group is Geneva, Switzerland. The Bilderbergers evolved into a secret world gov- ernment that now controls everything. The United Nations was then, and is now, an international joke. Beginning in 1953 a new president occupied the White House. He was"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 201 a man used to a structured staff organization with a chain of command. His method was to delegate authority and rule by committee. He made major decisions, but only when his advisors were unable to come to a consensus. His normal method was to read through or listen to several alternatives and then approve one. Those who worked closely with him have stated that his favorite comment was, \"Just do whatever it takes.\" He spent a lot of time on the golf course. This was not unusual for a man who had been career Army with the ultimate position of Supreme Allied Com- mander during the war, a post which had earned him five stars. The President was General of the Army Dwight David Eisenhower. During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 liv e aliens. Of the 10,4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South Africa. There were hundreds of sightings. Eisenhower knew that he had to wr estle and beat the alien problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the secret to the Congress, Early in 1953 the new President turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the secret st ructure of alien-task supervision, which was to become a reality within one year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus born. It was Nelson's uncle Winthrop Al drich who had been crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The whole Rockefeller family and with them, the Rockefeller empi re, had solidly backed Ike. Eisen- hower belonged heart and soul to th e Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family. Asking Rockefeller for help with the alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever made for the future of the United States and maybe for humanity. Within one week of Eisenhower's election he had appointed Nelson Rockefeller chairman of a Presidential Advisory Committee on Govern- ment Organization. Rockefeller w as responsible for planning the reor- ganization of the government, something he had dreamed of for many years. New Deal programs went into one single cabinet position called the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. When the Congress ap- proved the new Cabinet position in Ap ril 1953, Nelson was named to the post of Undersecretary to Oveta Culp Hobby. In 1953 astronomers discovered large objects in space which were tracked moving toward the Earth. It was first believed that they were asteroids. Later evidence proved that the objects could only be spaceships. Project SIGMA intercepted alien radio communications. When the objects reached the Earth they took up a very high geosynchronous orbit around"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"202 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper the equator. There were several huge ships, and their actual intent was unknown. Project SIGMA and a new project, PLATO, through radio com- munications using the computer binary language, were able to arrange a landing that resulted in face-to-face cont act with alien beings from another planet. This landing took place in the desert. The movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a fictionalized version of the actual events. Project PLATO was tasked with establishing diplomatic relations with this race of space aliens. A hostage was left with us as a pledge that they would return and formalize a treaty. In the meantime, a race of humanoid aliens landed at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida and successfully communicated with the U.S. govern- ment. This group warned us against the race orbiting the equator and offered to help us with our spiritu al development. They demanded that we dismantle and destroy our nucl ear weapons as the major condition. They refused to exchange technology c iting that we were spiritually unable to handle the technology we alre ady possessed. These overtures were rejected on the grounds that it would be foolish to disarm in the face of such an uncertain future. There was no track record to read from. It may have been an unfortunate decision. A third landing at Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, took place in 1954. The base was closed for three days and no one was allowed to enter or leave during that time. The historical event had been planned in ad- vance. Details of a treaty had been agreed upon. Eisenhower arranged to be in Palm Springs on vacation. On the appointed day the President was spirited to the base. The excuse was gi ven to the press that he was visiting a dentist. Witnesses to the event have st ated that three UFOs flew over the base and then landed. Antiaircraf t batteries were undergoing live-fire training and the startled personnel actually fired at the crafts as they passed overhead. Luckily, the shells missed and no one was injured. President Eisenhower met with the al iens on February 20,1954, and a formal treaty between the alien nation and the United States of America was signed. We then received our first alien ambassador from outer space. He was the hostage that had been left at the first landing in the desert. His name and title was His Omnipotent Highness Crlll or Krlll, pronounced Crill or Krill. In the American tradition of disdain for royal titles he was secretly called Original Hostage Crlll, or Krlll. Shortly after this meeting President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack. Four others present at the meeting we re Franklin Allen of the Hearst newspapers, Edwin Nourse of Brookings Institute, Gerald Light of meta- physical research fame, and Catholic Bishop MacIntyre of Los Angeles. Their reaction was judged as a microcosm of what the public reaction"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 203 might be. Based upon this reaction, it was decided that the public could not be told. Later studies confirmed the decision as sound. An emotionally revealing letter written by Gerald Light spells it out in chilling detail: \"My dear Friend: I ha ve just returned from Muroc. The report is true — devastatingly true! I made the journey in company with Franklin Allen of the Hearst papers and Edwin Nourse of Brookings In- stitute (Truman's erstwhile financial adviser) and Bishop Maclntyre of L.A. (confidential names for the present, please.) When we were allowed to enter the restricted section (after about six hours in which we were checked on every possible item, event, incident and aspect of our personal and public lives), I had the distinct feeling that the world had come to an end with fantastic realism. For I have ne ver seen so many human beings in a state of complete collapse and confusi on, as they realized that their own world had indeed ended with such finality as to beggar description. The reality of \"other-plane\" aeroforms is now and forever removed from the realms of speculation and made a rath er painful part of the consciousness of every responsible scientific and political group. During my two days' visit I saw five separate and distinct types of aircraft being studied and handled by our Air Force officials — with the assistance and permission of the Etherians! \"I have no words to express my reactions. It has finally happened. It is now a matter of history. President Eisenhower, as you may already know, was spirited over to Muroc one night during his visit to Palm Springs recently. And it is my convi ction that he will ignore the terrific conflict between the various \"authorities\" and go directly to the people via radio and television — if the impasse continues much longer. From what I could gather, an official statement to the country is being prepared for delivery about the middle of May.\" We know that no such announcement was ever made. The silence- control group won the day. We also know that two more ships, for which we can find no witnesses, either landed sometime after the three or were already at the base before the three la nded. Gerald Light specifically states that five ships were present and were undergoing study by the Air Force. His metaphysical experience is evident in that he calls the entities \"Etherians.\" Gerald Light capitalized \"Etherians,\" calling attention to the fact that these beings might have been viewed as gods by Mr. Light. The alien emblem was known as the \"Trilateral insignia\" and was displayed on the craft and worn on the alien uniforms. Both of these landings and the second meeting were filmed. These films exist today. The treaty stated that the aliens w ould not interfere in our affairs and we would not interfere in theirs.

They would furnish us with advanced technology and would help us in our technological development. They would not make any treaty with any other Earth nation. They could abduct humans on a limited and periodic basis for the purpose of medical examination and monitoring of our development, with the stipulation that the humans would not be harmed, would be returned to their point of abduction, would have no memory of the event, and that the alien nation would furnish Majesty Twelve with a list of all human contacts and abductees on a regularly scheduled basis. It was agreed that each nation would receive the ambassador of the other for as long as the treaty remained in force. It was fu rther agreed that the alien nation and the United States would exchange 16 personnel with the purpose of learning of each other. The alien \"guests'' would remain on earth. The human \"guests\" would travel to the alien point of origin for a specified period of time, then return , at which point a reverse exchange would be made. A reenactment of this event was dramatized in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A tipoff to who works for whom can be determined by the fact that Dr. J. Allen Hynek served as the technical advisor for the film. I noticed that the Top Secret report containing the official version of the truth of the alien question, entitled Project GRUDGE, which I read while in the Navy, was co-authored by Lt. Col. Friend and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was cited as a CIA asset attached to Project GRUDGE — Dr. Hynek, the one who debunke d many legitimate UFO incidents when he functioned as the scientific member of the very public Project BLUEBOOK. Dr. Hynek is the man res ponsible for the infamous \"it was only swamp gas\" statement. It was agreed that bases would be constructed unde rground for the use of the alien nation and that two bases would be constructed for the joint use of the alien nation and the United States Government. Exchange of technology would take place in the jointly occupied bases. These alien bases would be constructed under Indian reservations in the Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and one would be constructed in an area known as Dreamland. Dreamland was built in the Mojave desert near, or in, a place called Yucca. I cannot remember if it was Yucca Valley, Yucca Flat, or Yucca Prov ing Ground, but Yucca Valley is what I always seem to want to say. More UFO sightings and incidents occur in the Mojave desert of California than an y other place in the world. So many, in fact, that no one even bothers to make reports. Anyone who ventures into the desert to talk to the residents will be astounded by the frequency of activity and with the degree of acceptance demonstrated by those who have come to regard UFOs as normal."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 205 All alien areas are under complete control of the Naval Department, according to the documents that I re ad. All personnel who work in these complexes receive their checks from the Navy through a subcontractor. The checks never make reference to the government or the Navy. Con- struction of the bases began immediately, but progress was slow. Large amounts of money were made available in 1957. Work continued on the Yellow Book. Project REDLIGHT was formed and experimentation in test-flying alien craft was begun in earnest. A super-Top Secret facility was built at Groom Lake in Nevada in the midst of the weapons test range. It was code-named Area 51. The installation was placed under the Department of the Navy and all personnel required a Q clearance as well as Executive presidential, called MAJESTIC) approval. This is ironic, due to the fact that the President of the United States does not have clearance to visit the site. The alien base and exchange of technology actually took place in an area code-named Dreamland above gr ound, and the underground portion was dubbed \"the Dark Side of the Moon.\" According to the documenta- tion that I read, at least 600 alien beings actually resided full time at this site along with an unknown number of scien tists and CIA personnel. Due to the fear of implantation, only certain people were allowed to interface with the alien beings, and those personnel were and are watched and monitored continuously. The Army was tasked to form a supersecret organization to furnish security for the alien-tasked projects. This organization became the Na- tional Reconnaissance Organization based at Fort Carson, Colorado. The specific teams trained to secure the projects were called Delta. Lt. Col. James \"Bo\" Gritz was a Delta Force Commander. A second project code-named SNOWBIRD was promulgated to ex- plain away any sightings of the REDLIGHT crafts as being Air Force experiments. The SNOW BIRD crafts were manufactured using conven- tional technology and were flown for the press on several occasions. Project SNOWBIRD was also used to debunk legitimate public sightings of alien craft (UFOs to the public, IACs to those in the know). Project SNOW- BIRD was very successful, and report s from the public declined steadily until recent years. A multimillion-dollar Secret fund was organized and kept by the Military Office of the White House. This fund was used to build over 75 deep underground facilities.

To date there are more th an 75 sites spread around the country which were built using m oney from this fund. Th e Atomic Energy Com- mission has built at least an additi onal 22 underground sites. See the chapter on Mt. Weather. The location and everythi ng to do with these s ites were and are con- sidered and treated as Top Secret. The money was and is in control of the Military Office of the White House, a nd was and is laundered through so circuitous a web that even the most knowledgeable spy or accountant cannot follow it. As of 1 980 only a few at the beginni ng and end of this web knew what the money was for. At the beginning we re Representative George Mahon of Texas, the chairman of the Hous e Appropriations Com- mittee and of its Defense Subcommittee; and Representative Robert Sikes of Florida, chairman of the Hous e Appropriations Military Construction Subcommittee. Today it is rumored th at House Speaker Jim Wright con- trolled the money in Cong ress and that a power st ruggle removed him. At the end of the line were the President, Majesty Twelve, the director of the Military Office and a commander at the Washington Navy Yard. The money was authorized by the Appropriations Committee, who allocated it to the Departme nt of Defense as a Top Secret item in the Army construction program. The Army, howe ver, could not spend it and in fact did not even know what it was for. Authorization to spend th e money was in reality given to the Navy. The money was ch anneled to the Chesapeake Division of the Navy Engine ers, who did not know what it was for, either. Not even the commanding officer, who was an admiral, knew what the fund was to be used for. Only one man, a Navy commander who was assigned to the Chesapeake Division but in reality was responsible only to the Military Office of the White House, knew of the actual purpose, amount, and ultimate destin ation of the Top Secret money. The total secre- cy surrounding the fund meant that al most every trace of it could be made to disappear by the very few people w ho controlled it. There has never been and most likely never will be an audit of th is secret money."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 207 Large amounts of money were transferred from the Top Secret fund to a location at Palm Beach, Florida, that belongs to the Coast Guard called Peanut Island. The island is adj acent to property which was owned by Joseph Kennedy. The money was said to have been used for landscaping and general beautification. Some time ago a TV news special on the Ken- nedy assassination told of a Coast Guard officer transferring money in a briefcase to a Kennedy employee across this property line. Could this have been a secret payment to the Kennedy family for the loss of their son John F. Kennedy? The payments continue d through the year 1967 and then stopped. The total amount transferred is unknown and the actual use of the money is unknown. Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller changed positions again. This time he was to take C. D. Jackson's old pos ition, which had been called the Special Assistant for Psychological Strategy. With Nelson's appointment the name was changed to the Special Assistant for Cold War Strategy. This position would evolve over the years into the same position Henry Kissinger was ultimately to hold under President Nixon. Officially he was to give \"advice and assistance in the development of increased understanding and coperation among all peoples.\" The official description was a smoke screen, for secretly he was the Preside ntial Coordinator for the Intelligence Community. In his new post Rockefeller reported directly, and solely, to the President. He attended meetings of the Cabinet, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and the National Security Council, which was the highest policy-making body in the government. Nelson Rockefeller was also given a second important job as the head of the secret unit called the Pla nning Coordination Group, which was formed under NSC 5412/1 in March 1955. The group consisted of different ad hoc members, depending on the subject on the agenda. The basic members were Rockefeller, a representative of the Department of Defense, a representative of the Department of State, and the Director of Central Intelligence. It was soon called the 5412 Committee or the Special Group. NSC 5412/1 established the rule that covert operations were subject to approval by an executive committee, whereas in the past these operations were initiated solely on the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence. By secret Executive Memorandum NSC 5510, Eisenhower had pre- ceded NSC 5412/1 to establish a perman ent committee (not ad hoc) to be known as Majesty Twelve (MJ-12) to oversee and conduct all covert ac- tivities concerned with the alien ques tion. NSC 5412/1 was created to explain the purpose of these meetings when Congress and the press be- came    curious.

Edgar Hoover, six men from the executive committee of the Council on Foreign Relations known as the \"Wise Men,\" six men from the executive committee of the JASON Group, and Dr. Edward Teller. The JASON Group is a secret scientific group formed during the Manhattan Project and administered by the Mitre Corporation. The inner core of the Council on Foreign Relations recruits its members from the Skull & Bones and the Scroll & Key soci eties of Harvard and Yale. The Wise Men are key members of the Council on Foreign Relations and also mem- bers of a secret Order of the Quest known as the JASON Society. There were 19 members of Majesty Twelve. The first rule of Majesty Twelve was that no order could be given and no action could be taken without a majority vote of twelve in favor, thus Majority Twelve. Orders issued by Majesty Twelve became known as Majority Twelve directives. This group was made up over the years of the top officers and direc- tors of the Council on Foreign Relati ons and later the Trilateral Commis- sion. Gordon Dean, George Bush and Zbigniew Brzezinski were among them. The most important and influential of the Wise Men were John McCloy, Robert Lovett, Averell Harrima n, Charles Bohlen, George Kennan, and Dean Acheson. Their policies were to last well into the decade of the '70s. It is significant that President Eisenhower as well as the first six Majesty Twelve members from the Government were also members of the Council on Foreign Relations. This gave control of the most secret and powerful group in government to a special-interest club that was itself controlled by the Illuminati. Thorough researchers will soon discover that not all of the Wise Men attended Harvard or Yale and not all of them were chosen for Skull & Bones or Scroll & Key membership during their college years. You will be able to quickly clear up the mystery by obt aining the book The Wise Men by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas, Simon a nd Schuster, New York. Under il- lustration #9 in the center of the book you will find the caption: \"Lovett with the Yale Unit, above far right, and on the beach: His initiation into Skull and Bones came at an air base near Dunkirk.\" I have found that members were chosen on an ongoing basis by invitation based upon merit postcollege and were not confined to Harvard or Yale attendees only Because of this fact, a complete list of Skull & Bones members can never be compiled from the catalogues or addresses of the college segment of the Russell Trust, also known as the Brotherhood of Death, or the Skull & Bones.

I believe that the answer lies hidden in the CFR files, if files exist. A chosen few were later initiated into the secret branch of the Order of the Quest known as the JASON Soci ety. They are all members of the Council on Foreign Relatio ns and at that time we re known as the Eastern Establishment. This shou ld give you a clue to the far-reaching and serious nature of these most secret college so cieties. The society is alive and well today, but now includes members of the Trilateral Commission as well. The Trilateralists existed secretly be fore 1973. The name of the Trilateral Commission was taken from the alien fl ag known as the Trilateral Insignia. Majesty Twelve was to survive right up to the present day. Under Eisen- hower and Kennedy it was erroneously called the 5412 Co mmittee, or more correctly, the Special Group. In the Johnson administration it became the 303 Comm ittee because the name 5412 had been compromised in the book The Secret Government. Actually, NSC 5412/1 was leaked to the author to hide the existence of NSC 5410. Unde r Nixon, Ford, and Carter it was called the 40 Committee, and under Reagan it became the PI-40 Committee. Over all those years only the name changed. By 1955 it became obvious that the aliens had deceived Eisenhower and had broken the treaty. Mutilated hu mans were being found along with mutilated animals across th e United States. It was suspected that the aliens were not submitting a complete list of human contacts and abductees to Majesty Twelve and it was suspected that not all abductees had been returned. The Soviet Union was suspected of interacting with them, and this proved to be true. The aliens stated that they had been, and were then, manipulating masses of pe ople through secret societies, witchcraft, magic, the occult, and religion. You must under stand that this cl aim could also be a manipulation. After severa l Air Force combat air engagements with alien craft it also became apparent that our weapons were no match against them. In November 1955 NSC-5412/2 was issu ed establishing a study com- mittee to explore \"all fa ctors which are involved in th e making and im- plementing of foreign policy in the nuc lear age/' This was only a blanket of snow that covered the real subject of st udy, the alien question. By secret Executive Memorandum NS C 5511 in 1954, President Eisen- hower had commissioned the study group to \"examine all the facts, evi- dence, lies, and deception and discove r the truth of th e alien question.\" NSC 5412/2 was only a cover that had become necessary when the press began inquiring as to the purpose of regular meetings of such important men.

In truth, the manuscript had already been 80% written while Kissinger was at Harvard. The study group continued, veiled in secrecy. A clue to the seriousness Kissinger attached to the study can be found in statements by his wife and friends. Many of them stated that Henry would leave home early each morning and return late each night without speaki ng to anyone or responding to any- one. It seemed as if he were in a nother world which held no room for outsiders. These statements are very revealing. The revelations of the alien presence and actions during the study must have been a great shock. Henry Kissinger was definitely out of character during this time. He would never again be affected in this manner, no matter the seriousness of any subsequent event. On many occasi ons he would work very late into the night after having already put in a full day. This behavior eventually led to divorce. A major finding of the alien study was that the public could not be told. It was believed that this would most certainly lead to economic collapse, collapse of the religious st ructure, and national panic, which could lead into anarchy. Secrecy thus continued. An offshoot of this find- ing was that if the public could not be told, Congress could not be told. Funding for the projects and research would have to come from outside the Government. In the meantime money was to be obtained from the military budget and from CIA confidential, nonappropriated funds. Another major finding was that th e aliens were using humans and animals for a source of glandular secretions, enzymes, hormonal secre- tions, blood plasma and possibly in ge netic experiments. The aliens ex- plained these actions as necessary to thei r survival. They stated that their genetic structure had deteriorated a nd that they were no longer able to reproduce. They stated that if they were unable to improve their genetic structure, their race would soon cease to exist. We looked upon their explanations with extreme suspicion. Since our weapons were literally useless against the aliens, Majesty Tw elve decided to continue friendly diplomatic relations until such time as we were able to develop a technol- ogy which would enable us to challe nge them on a military basis. Over- tures would have to be made to the S oviet Union and other nations to join forces for the survival of humanity. In the meantime plans were developed to research and construct two weapons systems using conventional and nuclear technology, which would hopefully bring us to parity. The results of the research were Projects JOSHUA and EXCALIBUR."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"212 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper JOSHUA was a weapon captured from th e Germans which was capable of shattering 4-inch-thick armor plate at a range of two miles. It used aimed, low-frequency sound waves, and it was believed that this weapon would be effective against the alien craf t and beam weapons. EXCALIBUR was a weapon carried by missile not to rise above 30,000 feet above ground level (AGL), not to deviate from designated target more than 50 meters, able to would penetrate \"1,000 meters of tufa , hard-packed soil su ch as that found in New Mexico,\" carry a one-megat on warhead, and intended for use in destroying the aliens in their underg round bases. JOSHUA was developed successfully but never used, to my knowledge. EXCALIBUR was not pushed until recent years and now, we are told, there is an unprecedented effort to develop this weapon. The p ublic would be told that EXCALIBUR would be needed to take out S oviet underground command posts. We know that is not true because one rule of war is that you try not to destroy the leaders. They are needed either to unconditionally surrender or to negotiate terms. Leaders are also need ed to ensure peaceful transition of power and the compliance of the populace to all negotiated or dictated terms. The events at Fatima in the early pa rt of the century were scrutinized. On the suspicion that it was alien manipulation, an intelligence operation was put into motion to penetrate the secrecy surrounding the event. The United States utilized its Vatican mo les and soon obtained the entire Vati- can study, which included the prophecy. This prophecy stated that if man did not turn from evil and place himself at the feet of Christ the planet would self-destruct and the events described in the book of Revelations would indeed come to pass. The prophecy demanded that Russia be consecrated to the Sacred Heart. It stated that a child would be born who would unite the world with a plan for world peace and a false religion. The people would discern that he was evil and was indeed the Anti-Christ World War III would begin in the Middle East with an invasion of Israel by a United Arab nation using conventi onal weapons, which would culminate in a nuclear holocaust. Most of the lif e on this planet would suffer horribly and die as a result. The return of Ch rist would occur shortly thereafter. When the aliens were confronted with this finding they confirmed that it was true. The aliens explained that they had created us through genetic manipulation in a laboratory. They stated that they had manipulated the human race through religion, satanism, witchcraft, magic, and the occult. They further explained that they we re capable of time travel, and the events would indeed come to pass if the conditions were not met.

The aliens showed a hologram, which they claimed was the actual crucifixion of Christ. The Government filmed the hologram. We did not know whether to believe them. Were they using our GENUINE religions to manipulate us? Or were they indeed the source of our religions with which they had been manipulating us all along? Or was this the beginning scenario of the genuine END TIMES and the RETURN OF CHRIST which had been predicted in the Bible? I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER. A symposium was held in 1957 which was attended by some of the great scientific minds then living. They reached the conclusion that by, or shortly after, the year 2000 the planet WOULD self-destruct due to in- creased population and man's exploitation of the environment WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM GOD OR THE ALIENS. By secret Executive order of President Eisenhower, the JASON Scho- lars were ordered to study this scenario and make recommendations from their findings. The JASON Society CONFIRMED the finding of the scien- tistts and made three recommendati ons called ALTERNATIVES 1,2, and 3. Alternative 1 was to use nuclear devices to blast holes in the strato- sphere from which the heat and pollu tion could escape into space. They would then change the human cultures from that of exploitation into cultures of environmental protection. Of the three this was decided to be the least likely to succeed due to the inherent nature of man and the additional damage the nuclear explos ions would themselves create. The existence of a hole in the ozone layer may indicate that Alternative 1 might have been attempted. This is, however, only conjecture. Alternative 2 was to build a vast network of underground cities and tunnels in which a select representa tion of all cultures and occupations would survive and carry on the human race. The rest of humanity would be left to fend for themselves on the surface of the planet. We know that these facilities have been built and are ready and waiting for the chosen few to be notified. Alternative 3 was to exploit the a lien and conventional technology in order for a select few to leave the earth and establish colonies in outer space. I am not able to either confirm or deny the existence of \"batch consignments\" of human slaves, which would be used for the manual labor as a part of the plan. The Moon, code-named ADAM, was the object of primary interest, followed by the planet Mars, code-named EVE. I am now in possession of official NASA photographs of one of the moon bases.

It was decided BY THE ELITE that since th e population must be reduced and controlled, it would be in the best interest of the human race to rid ourselves of the undesira ble elements of our society. Specific targeted populations included BLACKS, HISPANICS, and HOMO- SEXUALS. The joint U.S. and Soviet lead ership dismisse d Alternative 1 but ordered work to begi n on Alternatives 2 and 3 virtually at the same time. In 1959 the Rand Corporation hosted a Deep Undergr ound Construc- tion Symposium. In the symposium re port, machines are pictured and described which could bore a tunnel 45 feet in diameter at the rate of 5 feet per hour in 1959. It also displays pictures of huge tunnels and under- ground vaults containing what appear to be complex facilities and possibly even cities. It appears that the previo us five years of all-out underground construction had made significan t progress by that time. The ruling powers decided that one means of funding the alien-con- nected and other \"black\" projects wa s to corner the illegal drug market. The English and French had establishe d a historical precedent when they exploited the opium trade in the Far East and used it to fill their coffers and gain a solid foothold in Chin a and Viet Nam, respectively. A young ambitious member of the Council on Forei gn Relations was approached. His name is George Bus h, who at the time was the president and CEO of the offshore divi sion of Zapata Oil, based in Texas. Zapata Oil was experimenting with the new technology of offshore drilling. It was correctly thought that the drugs coul d be shipped from South America to the offshore platforms by fishing boat, to be taken from there to shore by the normal transportation used for su pplies and personnel. By this method no customs or law enforcement agency would subject the cargo to search. George Bush agreed to help, and organized the operation in conjunc- tion with the CIA. The plan worked better than anyone had dreamed. It has since expanded worldwide. Th ere are now many other methods of bringing the illegal drugs into the country. It must always be remembered that George Bush began the sale of drugs to our children. The CIA now controls most of the world's illegal drug markets. The official space program was boost ed by President Kennedy in his inaugural address when he mandated th at the United States put a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Although innocent in its concep- tion, this mandate enabled those in charge to funnel vast amounts of money into black projects and conceal the REAL space program from the American people. A similar program in the Soviet Union served the same purpose. In fact, a joint alien, United States, and Soviet Union base existed on the Moon at the very mome nt Kennedy spoke the words."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 215 On May 22,1962, a space probe landed on Mars and confirmed the existence of an environment which could support life.

A public charade of antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States has been maintained over all th ese years in order to fund projects in the name of national defense when in fact we are the closest allies. At some point President Kennedy discovered portions of the truth concerning the drugs and the aliens. He issued an ultimatum in 1963 to Majesty Twelve. President Kennedy assured them that if they did not clean up the drug problem, he would. He informed Majesty Twelve that he intended to reveal the presence of aliens to the American people within the following year, and ordered a plan de veloped to implement his decision, President Kennedy was not a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and knew nothing of Alternative 2 or Alternative 3. (Although some researchers claim JFK was a member of the CFR, I can find no legitimate list with his name upon it.) Internationally, the operations were supervised by the Bilderberg elite committee know n as the Policy Committee. In the United States they were supervised by the executive committee of the CFR and in the Soviet Union by its sister organization. President Kennedy's decision struck f ear into the hearts of those in charge. His assassination was ordered by the Policy Committee and the order was carried out by agents in Dallas. President John F. Kennedy was murdered by the Secret Service agent who drove his car in the motorcade and the act is plainly visible in the Zapruder film. WATCH THE DRIVER AND NOT KENNEDY WHEN YOU VIEW THE FILM. All of the wit- nesses who were close enough to the car to see William Greer shoot Ken- nedy were themselves all murdered w ithin two years of the event.

Many other patriots who attempted to reveal the alien secret have also been murdered throughout the intervening years. At the present time over 200 material witnesses or people actua lly involved with the assassination are dead. The odds against this happening are so high that no one has been able to calculate them. The odds against the first 18 to die within two years of the assassination were calculated at one hundred thousand trillion to one.

I told him that the Top Secret documen ts stated that the act was plainly visible in a film withheld from the public. I told John that I had been looking for a film that showed Greer shoot JFK for 16 years but had not found one. I was shocked and very pleasantly surprised when John asked me, \"Would you like to see it?\" I, of c ourse, replied in the affirmative and John invited Annie and me to his home in Las Vegas. We spent four days with John. He not only showed me th e film but gave me a video copy. I showed the video whenever I spoke to a group of people. The film is titled Dallas Revisited, John told me that he obtained it from a CIA acquaintance whom he was not at liberty to name. I later found out the originator of that version of the Zapruder film was La rs Hansson. John Lear was showing the film at every meeting that he conducted. Shortly after Lear gave me a copy of the film, Lars Hansson called and asked if he could drop by to meet with me at my home in Fullerton, California. I told him he could and asked him to bring a better copy of the film if he had one. Lars said that he would. He stated that he would also bring a film on a man named Bo Gritz, of whom I had never heard. Mr. Hansson informed me that he had ma de the video for Bo Gritz and John Lear and that both were using it in their lectures. I found out much later that Bo Gritz was selling the tape for $10 per copy. Lars came to the house, brought the films on videotape and we spoke for about an hour. His main purpose was to tell me that he wanted me to expose people to the film but did not want me to connect him to the film in any manner. I agreed not to divulg e the source and I kept my word. I began to use the tape in my lectures. When I found out that Bo Gritz was making it available, I bowed to public pressure and also made it available. Some time later I read an L.A.-based newsletter (forgot the name) in which Lars Hansson stated that he did not know that I had the film and did not know that I was showing it at lectures. Hansson stated in the newslet- ter that he was at my Hollywood High lecture on November 5,1989, and that he tried to protest my use of it during the question-and-answer period but that he never had a chance to be recognized. We videotaped that event, and at the end I asked anyone with questions or comments to walk to a microphone that we had placed in the aisle. I have examined every inch of that videotape and Lars Hansson ne ver got up from his seat, nor did he ever raise his hand, nor did he attempt in any way to be recognized.

You see his head pointing backwards towards the Presiden t. In this enhanced close-up you see the impact of the bullet upon the Pres ident. The force of the shot drives him violently backward against the back of the seat. You see Mrs. Kennedy react in horror.\" Then later in the film Lars Hansson makes this statement: \"You can clearly see his [the driver's] head turning and his arm, and the weapon exte nding into view over his right shoulder.\" I agreed not to use his voice. In subsequent lectures I showed the tape with no audio. As it turned out, people were able to see it better with no narration. It is important that you understand the above, because in the late summer of 1990, after I had been showi ng the film for over a year and a half, Lars Hansson began to show up on radio pr oclaiming that Greer, the driver, did not shoot the President. Lars Hansson showed up at my fall 1990 Beverly Hills High School lecture and disrupted the lecture, ye lling out taunts and otherwise making an ass out of himself. When the lecture ended he accosted people in the lobby and, along with David Lifton, attempted to convince memb ers of the audience that they didn't really see Greer shoot Kennedy. To their credit most of th e audience told Hansson and Lifton to stick it where the sun don't shine. Once people see it with their own eyes they can no longer be foole d. Hansson, Lifton, Grodin, and the other agents of the Secret Govern ment are running ou t of time. Ameri- cans are catching on to the scam. I s hudder to think what will happen to these people when Americans finally ge t angry. Do not forget that Lear informed me that his source for the film was a CIA agent who later turned out to be Lars Hansson. Hansson later claimed that I violat ed his copyright. He had no copy- right. Hansson himself had violated someone's copyrigh t by making the film and giving it to me, Lear, and Gritz. I didn't and still don't give a damn about copyright on THIS particul ar film. If I did, no one would ever know who really killed our President. Bo Gritz stated on radio that he felt exactly the same way.

Did you know that every time a caller asked Ricky White a question, Grodin answered for him? Do you really believe that is a coinciden ce? Ricky White's father did not kill Kennedy. For years I have been telling people and audiences about the dis- crepancies between the doctors' reports in Dallas and the autopsy report made at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

I have stated that the President's brain had disappeared and told why it had disappeared. All of a sudden David Lifton appear ed on radio and TV in 1990 telling the world that he had NE W evidence that he had discovered. Every bit of his new evidence was exactly what I had been telling people for years. It was the same information that I had to ld Bob Swan in 197 2. Lifton showed up at my lecture at Beverly Hills Hi gh School. After maki ng a scene at the box office because he had to pay, Lifton accosted anyone who ventured into the lobby, and along with Lars Hansson, attempted to convince them that they did not see Greer shoot Kennedy. Legitimate people would never have resorted to such disgraceful an d discrediting beha vior. My testimony and the public's outrage after seeing the murder of President Kennedy with their own eyes, has seriously damaged the cover-up. The behavior of Grodin, Lifton, and Hansson reveals the degree of damage. The public can now see without any doubt th at they are either part of the cover-up or that they are totally incompetent research ers, and in the case of Grodin, a bare-faced liar who may have committed treason. In the middle of all this, \"Hard Copy\" TV magazine called me and wanted to see the film. I showed them the film and they were shocked, excited and wanted an exclusive. I ga ve it to them but told them that I doubted that it would ever get on the air. A date was arranged to film an episode for airing, but just before we were scheduled to go on camera an NBC executive called the Los Angeles studios of \"Hard Copy\" and told them not to air the film. I tried to fi nd out the name of the executive, but no luck. That was the end of that. The pr oducer that had tried to air my story and the Kennedy film is no longer wi th \"Hard Copy.\" Her name is Bubs Hopper. I was approached by another producer (don't remember his name) from \"Inside Edition,\" another TV mag azine, who told me that Americans needed to see the film. I agreed to be on the show but told him the same thing, that I did not believe it would ever air. A week later I was listening to David Lifton on a radio talk show . Someone called in and asked David if he knew who I was and David Lift on said, \"I know who he is and we have a surprise for Mr. Cooper. We are going to put him away for good on a national TV show. We ar e going to get a full ac counting from that guy.\" I had someone call the producer and cancel because he had lied to me. He pleaded to have me on. I relayed through this intermediary that I would appear only if I could have editor ial control to make sure that he did not edit the segment to ridicule the film. He refused, and I then knew his"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"220 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper intention all along had be en to discredit me. When the segment aired, Lars Hansson was used as a stand-in, in my place. Hansson, the man who had been attacking me, stating that Greer had not fired at Kennedy, was now on TV stating that Greer killed Kennedy! The reason became obvious, as they had Bob Grodin on the next segmen t. Grodin ridiculed and debunked Hansson and the film. They had inte nded to do a hatchet job on me, but when I cancelled they c ould attack the film only with Hansson taking my place. It had every earmark of an agency operation. It didn't work. I discovered the next ploy when on radio Grodin stated that he would soon (finally) re lease a video of his so-called pristine copy of the Zapruder film overexposed to brin g out detail in the shadows. Overexposure would completely wash out Greer's arm and the gun, which are both in full sunlight and have the effect of re ndering both invisible to the viewer. hope that people are not as stupid as Grod in thinks they ar e. I will debate anyone at any time as long as it's in front of a live audience and nothing is edited. I have seen what a film editor can do to make people seem to say and do things that were never said or done. ***** During the United States' initial space exploration and the Moon landings every launch wa s accompanied by alien cr aft. On November 20, 1990, Los Angeles TV Cha nnel 2 announced that a separate, red, glowing, round-shaped object accompanied the sp ace shuttle Atlantis on its latest classified military mi ssion. That was the fi rst public admission. A Moon base, Luna, was photogra phed by the Lunar Orbiter and filmed by the Apollo astronauts. Domes, spires, tall round structures which look like silos, huge T-shaped mining vehicles that left stitchlike tracks in the lunar surfac e, and extremely large as well as small alien craft appear in the official NASA photogra phs. It is a joint United States and Soviet base: The space program is a farce and an unbelievable waste of money. Alternative 3 is a reality. It is not science fiction. The Apollo astronauts we re severely shaken by this experience, and their lives and subsequent statements reflect the depth of the revelation and the effect of the mu zzle order which followed. They were ordered to remain silent or suffer the extreme penalty, death, which was termed an \"expediency.\" One astronaut actually did talk to the British producers of the TV expos) \"Alternative 003.\" It was aired on the documentary, nonfic- tion program named \"Science Report,\" confinning many of the allegations. In the book Alternative 003 the pseu donym \"Bob Grodin\" was used in place of the astronaut's id entity. (The real Bob Grodi n is a friend of Leslie Watkins and is a part of the Kennedy assassination cover-up.) It was also"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 221 stated that the astronaut committed suicide in 1978. This cannot be vali- dated by any source, and I believe that several so-called facts in the book are really disinformation. I firmly believe that this disinformation is a result of pressure put upon the authors and is meant to nullify the effect upon the populace of the British TV expose \"Alternative 3.\" The headquarters of the internationa l conspiracy is in Geneva, Swit- zerland. The ruling body is made up of three committees consisting of thirteen members each, and all three t ogether comprise the 39 members of the executive committee of the body known as the Bilderberg Group. The most important and powerful of the three committees is the Policy Com- mittee. (It is more than interesti ng to note that the United States had thirteen original colonies and that 39 delegates from those colonies signed the Constitution after it was written a nd adopted in the first Constitutional Convention. Do you believe that is coincidence?) Policy Committee meet- ings are held on a nuclear submarin e beneath the polar icecap. A Soviet sub and an American sub join at an airlock and the meeting is convened. The secrecy is such that this was the only method which would ensure that the meetings could not be bugged. I can say that the book Alternative 003 is at least 70% true from my own knowledge and the knowledge of my s ources. I believe that the disinfor- mation was an attempt to compromise the British TV expos) with informa- tion that could be proven false, just as the \"Eisenhower Briefing Document,\" which was released here in the United States under the contin- gency plan Majestic Twelve, can also be proven false. Since our interaction with the aliens began we have come into posses- sion of technology beyond our wildest dreams. We currently have, and fly, atomic-powered antigravity-type craft in Nevada. Our pilots have made interplanetary voyages in these craft a nd have been to the Moon, Mars, and other lanets. We have been lied to a bout the true nature of the Moon, the planets Mars and Venus, and the real state of technology that we possess today, at this very moment.  There are areas on the Moon where pl ant life grows and even changes color with the seasons. This seasonal effect is because the Moon does not, as claimed, always present the exact same side to the Earth or the Sun. The Moon has several man-made lakes an d ponds upon its surface, and clouds have been observed and filmed in its atmosphere. It possesses a gravita- tional field — and man can walk upon its surface without a space suit, breathing from an oxygen bottle af ter undergoing decompression, the same as any deep-sea diver!  I have the official NASA photographs. Some of them were published in the books We Discovered Alien Bases on the Moon by Fred Steckling and"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"222 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Someone Else Is on the Moon. In 1969 a confronta tion broke out between the Soviets and Americans at the lunar ba se. The Soviets attempted to take control of the base and held American scientists and personnel hostage. We were able to restore order but not before 66 people were killed. The Soviets were suspended from the pr ogram for a period of two years. A reconciliation ev entually took place and once again we be gan to interact. Today the alliance continues. The Archuleta Mesa underground-base confrontation scenario is pure disinfor mation put out to c onfuse the issue. I knew that a confrontation had take n place but could not remember the details. John Lear had convinced me that aliens and Delta forces had fought at the Archul eta base. (The New World Or der must have an enemy from outer space.) Later, when I used regressive hypnosis to improve my memory, the true facts emerged. To my knowledge the only hostility between aliens and human s was provoked by the U. S. military when they were ordered to shoot down UFOs in order to capture technology. John Lear also says that we invented AIDS in order to kill blood-suck- ing aliens and that we are only containers for souls. This is hogwash! It is a clear vote for the \"aliens do not exist\" theory. When the Watergate scandal broke, President Nixon was confident that he could not be impeached. Maje sty Twelve had a different agenda. Nixon was ordered to resign, the inte lligence community rightfully con- cluding that an impeachment trial would open up the files and bare the secrets to the public eye. He refused. The first military coup ever to take place in the United States was carried out. The Join t Chiefs of Staff sent a Top Secret message to the Commande rs of all the U.S. armed forces throughout the world. It stated, \"Upon receipt of this message you will no longer carry out any orders from the White House. Acknowledge receipt.\" This message was sent a full five days before Nixon conceded and an- nounced publicly that he would resign. I saw the message. When I asked my commanding officer what he would do, as obviously the order violat ed the Constitution, I was told: \"I guess I will wait to see if any orders come from the White House, and then I will decide/' I did no t see any commun ication from the White House but that does not mean that none was sent . I have confirmation from three additional sources, all ex-military, who wrote or called to state that they saw the exact same order. These people are Randall Terpstra, ex-Navy; David Race, ex-Air Force; and Donald Campbell, ex-Navy. The transcript of a taped phone conversation between the author and Mr. Terpstra is presented as Chapter 11 of this book, and the signed statements of the others can be found in the Appendix. During all the years that this has been happening the Congress and the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 223 American people have seemed to know instinctively that something was not right. When the Watergate scanda l surfaced they jumped on the band- wagon and everyone thought that the agencies would be cleaned out. President Ford organized the Rockef eller Commission to do the job. His real purpose was to head off Cong ress and keep the cover-up going. Nelson Rockefeller, who headed the commission investigating the intel- ligence community, was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the one who helped Eisenhower build the Majesty Twelve power structure. Rockefeller uncovered only enough to keep the hounds at bay. He threw the Congress a few bones and the cover-up rolled merrily along as always. Later Senator Church would conduc t the famous Church hearings. He also was a prominent member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and he merely repeated the Rockefeller act. Again the cover-up prevailed. When the Iran-Contra affair emerged, we thought this time it had to come gushing out. Wrong again. Despite mountains of documents pointing to drug smuggling and other hidden mons ters, the cover-up sailed on. The Congress even seemed to go out of its way to duck the real issues. As mentioned earlier, one of the most serious facts uncovered is that North was involved in preparing a plan to suspend the Constitution of the United States of America. When Congressman Jack Brooks of Texas attempted to probe the issue he was silenced by the committee chairman. Could it be that Congress knows the whole thing and won't touch it? Are they among the select who have been picked for the Mars colony when the Earth begins to destruct, if the Earth is going to destruct? I cannot even begin to outline the entire financial empire controlled by the CIA, the NSA, and the Council on Foreign Relations, which in turn control and launder the money from drugs and other intelligence com- munity proprietary ventures; but I can give you a beginning. The amount of money is beyond anything you can imagine and is hidden in a vast network of banks and holding companies. You should first begin to look at the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corpora tion, the Schroder Trust Company, Schroders Ltd. (London), Helbert Wagg Holdings Ltd., J. Henry Schroder- Wagg & Co. Ltd., Schroder Gerbrude r and Company (Germany), Schroder Munchmeyer Gengst and Company, Castle Bank and its holding com- panies, the Asian Development Bank , and the Nugan Hand octopus of banks and holding companies. A contingency plan was formulated by Majesty Twelve to throw every one off the trail should they come close to the truth. The plan was known as MAJESTIC TWELVE. It was implemented with the release by Moore, Shandera, and Friedman of the purpo rted Eisenhower Briefing Document. The document is a fraud, because it is numbered 092447, a number which"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"224 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper does not exist and will not exist for quite a long time at the present rate. Truman wrote Executive orders in the 9000 range; Eisenhower's were in the 10,000 range; Ford was up to the 11,000 bracket; and Reagan reached only into the 12,000s. Executive orders ar e numbered consecutively, no matter who occupies the White House, for reas ons of continuity, record keeping, and to prevent confusion. This red he rring has thrown the entire research community off the trail for several y ears and has resulted in the wasted expenditure of money looking for information which does not exist. The Washington D.C.-based Fund for UFO Research headed by Bruce Maccabee has committed what I believe to be criminal fraud in connection with the Eisenhower Briefing Docume nt, Stanton Friedman, and the re- search team of Moore, Shandera, a nd Friedman. Maccabee solicited funds from people, promising to use those funds to investigate Moore's, Shandera's, and Friedman's claims and prove the Eisenhower Briefing Document to be genuine or fake. Instead he gave the entire $16,000 to Stanton Friedman and assigned HIM the task of establishing or destroying his own validity. What a snow job! People in the UFO community fell for the scam and eagerly awaited Stanton Friedman's findings. Of course, Friedman found that the documents we re genuine. Just what did people think he would find? HE WAS GI VEN $16,000 TO INVESTIGATE HIM- SELF! IT IS UNETHICAL. IT IS A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I SINCERELY BELIEVE IT TO BE CRIMINAL FRAUD, since money was taken in the process. Those w ho donated money in good faith should immediately bring suit against Stanton Friedman, Bruce Maccabee and the Fund for UFO Research. This farce resu lted in the total waste of $16,000. Many thousands of man hours have g one down a rathole. If you doubt the secret government's ability to lead you through the rose garden, you had better think again. Another plan is in force. It is the plan to prepare the public for eventual confrontation with an alien r ace. It could also intend to make you believe in an alien race that may not exist. The public is being bombarded with movies, radio, advertising, an d TV programs depicting almost every aspect of the purported true nature of an alien presence. This includes the good and the bad. Look around and pay a ttention. Someone is planning to make their presence known and the government is preparing you for it. They do not want any panic. The unprecedented number of sightings worldwide indicates that public exposure is not far off. Never in history have there been so many incidents involving UFOs and never in history have there been so many official acknowledgments.

Social welfare"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 225 programs were put into place to crea te a dependent, nonworking element in our society. The government then began to remove these programs to force people into a criminal class that did not exist in the '50s and '60s. The government encouraged the manufacture and importation of military firearms for the criminals to use. This is intended to foster a feeling of insecurity, which would lead the American people to voluntarily disarm themselves by passing laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called Orion, the CIA inculcated the desire in these people to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the antigun lobby. This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd amendment. Author's Note: I have found that these ev ents have indeed happened all over the country. In every instance that I ha ve investigated — the incident at the women's school in Canada, the shopping ce nter incident in Canada, the Stock- ton, California, massacre, and the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane — the shooters were all ex-mental patients or we re current mental patients who were ALL ON THE DRUG PROZAC! This drug, when taken in certain doses, increases the serotonin level in the patient, causing extrem e violence. Couple that with a posthypnotic suggestion or control through an electronic brain implant or microwave or E.L.F. intrus ion and you get mass murder, ending in every case with the suicide of the perpetrator. Exhume the bodies of the murderers and check for a brain implant. I think you are going to be surprised. In every case the name of the murderer's doctor or mental treatment facility has been withheld. I believe we will be able to establish intelligence-com- munity connections and/or connecti ons to known CIA experimental mind- control programs when we finally disco ver who these doctors of death really are. Due to the wave of crime sweeping the nation, the media will convince the American people that a state of an archy exists within the major cities. They are now building their case almost nightly on TV and daily in the newspapers. When public opinion has been won to this idea, they intend to state that a terrorist group armed with a nuclear weapon has entered the United States and that they plan to de tonate this device in one of our cities. (This is now being set up by the crisis in the Middle East.) The Government will then suspend the Constitution and declare martial law. The secret alien army of implanted humans and all dissidents, which translates into anyone they choose, will be rounded up and placed in the one-mile-square concentration camps which already exist. Are the people whom they in- tend to place in these concentration camps destined to make up the reported \"batch consignments\" of slave labor needed by the space colonies?

When these events have transpired, the SECRET GOVERNMENT and/or ALIEN takeover will be complete. Your free dom will never be returned and you will live in slavery for the remainder of your life. You had better wake up and you had better do it now! Philip Klass is an agent of the CIA. This was stated in the documents I saw between 1970 and 1973. One of his jobs as an aviation expert was to debunk everything to do with UFOs . All military commanders were in- structed to call him to gain information on how to debunk and/or explain UFO contacts and/or sightings to the public and/or the press if and when the need arose. Some people seem to love Klass. They encourage him and heap large doses of attention upon him. He is invited to speak at UFO events and is quoted in papers, books, and newspapers as being the expert on \"what really happened.\" Philip Klass is not operating in our best interest. His debunkings and explanations of UFO sightings are so fu ll of holes that a six-year-old child should be able to discern his true pur pose. I have seen poor misled people actually ask Klass for his autograph, an act similar in magnitude to Elliot Ness asking Al Capone for his autograph. I have found that in many instances the secret elect are absolutely right when they state that \"people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent.\" (Quote from \"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\" in Chapter Two). We get exactly what we deserve in most instances. William Moore, Jaimie Shandera, and Stanton Friedman are witting (with full knowledge, understanding, and consent) agents of the Secret Government. William Moore's reporte d use of a Defense Investigative Service ID card and his reported self-confession to Lee Graham that he is an agent of the government confirmed it. (Lee Graham phoned me at my home, and when asked, confirmed that Moore had indeed shown him a Defense Investigative Service ID.) Moore's later confession proved it with- out any doubt. Author's Note: On July 1,1989, the nigh t before I presented this paper at the MUFON symposium in Las Vegas, William Moore admitted that he was a government agent, that he had released disinformation to researchers, that had falsified documents, that he ha d spied upon researchers and reported information concerning those researcher s to the intelligence community, that he had helped in a counterintelligence operation against Paul Bennewicz that resulted in Mr. Bennewicz's commitment to a mental institution, and that he had done all this with full knowledge of what he was doing. He is either a"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 227 traitor or a stone-hearted manipulator at best. Some of the self-appointed \"ufologists\" still look up to Moore, and still cite his research in their corresponden ce, papers, and books. This reflects a degree of ignorance and stupidity in the UFO community. Bruce Maccabee wrote a letter to Caveat Emptor citing articles from William Moore's publi- cation, Focus, as proof that I am discredited. Dream on. It is no mystery to me why mainstream America calls ufologists whackos, loonies, and nuts. In some cases they are. Jaime Shandera is the man responsib le for my loss of employment as the Executive Director of National Technical College. Shortly after going public, Shandera showed up at the college wearing a brown suit and carrying a briefcase. He ignored the r eceptionist's attempts to help him. She informed me that a man had walked into the college and appeared to ne inspecting the building and classrooms. I found Mr. Shandera peering into the word-processing classroom. I asked him if I could be of any help. He said no and ignored me. I explaine d that I was the Executive Director and again asked if I could be of any help. Again he said no but gave me some very hard stares and appeared to have been taken off guard. He seemed to be extremely nervous and immediately left the building. I followed him out the door, and a man across the street snapped my picture with a 35mm camera. I watched as Jaim e Shandera walked to his car, took one last look at me and then drove aw ay. A few days later he repeated the act, only this time he told me that he had seen an ad that the college was for sale and he was looking over the property. I saw him again, coming out of the corporate offices. When he saw me he again became extremely nervous and hurried to his car, took off his jacket before getting in and then drove off. A few minutes later I was called to the President's office and told that the college could not use anyone who could jeopardize the status of government assistance by getting involv ed with flying saucers. I knew wthat had happened and tendered my resignation effective April 15,1989. I had no intention of stopping my activities and I did not wish to hurt the college or the students who depended so much on government aid pro- grams. All this time Shandera thou ght he had pulled it off anonymously, but I and several others have always known that it was he. Now you know. Jaime Shandera was positively identified by me, the Security Depart- ment Head, and the receptionist. Later I obtained another positive iden- tification from the Vice President in charge of Admissions. John Lear was at that time the only person who knew the name and address of my place of employment.

They are CIA all the way. Stanton Friedman has told me and others that years ago he \"helped develop a nuclear reactor to power an aircraft that was the size of a basketball, was clean, turned out hydr ogen, and worked like a dream\" (his words, not mine). Several others have written me to say that they also were told the same thing by Mr. Friedman . Roger Scherrer is one who remem- bers Stanton relating to him this same story. The only fuel which could go into such an engine and produce hydrogen as a byproduct is water, and that is precisely what at least one type of alien craft uses — nuclear energy and water, according to the documenta tion I read while in Naval Intel- ligence. Is he really unwitting? I seriously doubt it. He was a member of the Moore, Shandera, and Friedman research team, and it was they who implemented the MAJESTIC TWELVE contingency plan. In documents that I read between 1970 and 1973, the names of in- dividuals were listed who had been targeted for recruitment. These docu- ments stated that these people were to be coerced, using patriotism as a motivating force whenever possible. If necessary, financial assistance would be provided through employment with a proprietary front com- pany or through grants. This is, coincidentally, the method by which Friedman got his $16,000 from another agent, Bruce Maccabee. We have also found that Moore has received m oney for research from at least two CIA front companies. This has been confirmed by the research of Grant Cameron. Others named on the list were cited as active intelligence-agen- cy assets. When I first presented this pa per I gave only a partial list of those named in the Naval Intelligence docum ents. Following are as many names as I can remember. (There may be more, but these are all that I can recall at this time.) Stanton Friedman, CIA; John Lear, CIA (Lear's father was named as having participated in antigravity research); William Moore; John Keel; Charles Berlitz; Bruce Maccabee, ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence); Linda Moulton Howe; Philip Klass, CIA; Jame s Moseley, CIA (Moseley's father was discussed in a very complime ntary manner); Virgil Armstrong, CIA (listed as Postlethwaite); Wendelle Stevens, CIA; Dr. J. Allen Hynek, CIA. That is the list as I remember it. There may have been others, but I cannot recall. I know of other agents who were not on the list. You must remember that when I first wrote this paper I thought that Bruce Maccabee might not have been recruited, but th en later he proved me wrong when he gave Stanton Friedman $16,000 to investigate himself.

The first word was a colo r and the second word was a bird. The code was \"Gold Eagle.\" When Stant on Friedman first contacted me he used the code. I pretended ignorance but he asked me several times if I had ever seen or heard of Gold Eagle. J ohn Lear also asked me if I had ever heard of Gold Eagle. He too was testing me. They knew that I had access to correct information and were attemp ting to determine if I were one of them. As George Bush would say, \"Read my lips.\" I was never one of you. I will never be one of you. When I talked to Stan Deyo in Austra lia by phone, he told me the code given to him was \"Blue Falcon.\" Stan was a victim of mind-control ex- perimentation while a cadet at the Air Force Academy. He and over 80 other cadet mind-control subjects resigned from the academy in protest. He has been on a crusade to discover th e truth ever since. Stan has written two excellent books, The Cosmic Conspi racy, and The Vindicator Scrolls. I recommend you read them both. I think that Linda Moulton Howe may be innocent of witting involve- ment. Linda in particular seems to ha ve exercised extreme care in what she has presented to the public. Her research is excellent. I was impressed when she confided to me that Sgt. Richard Doty of the Counterintelligence Division of the Air Force Office of Speci al Investigations had taken her into the Intelligence office at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico and showed her the exact same documents that I had seen while in the Navy. She even saw the same information on the Kennedy assassination naming Greer as the assassin. Ms. Howe is al so the only person in the world outside of the intelligence community who knows the truth as I know it regarding Operation MAJORITY. She has exercised good judgment and great restraint in not revealing the contents of those documents to the public. It is for this reason that I belie ve that an attempt has been made to use her. Fortunately, Linda did not fall off a turnip truck and she didn't play the game. I recommend you read her book entitled Alien Harvest. You should be able to order it from any good bookstore. I have discovered that Whitley Strieber is a CIA asset, as is Budd Hopkins. Strieber's book Maje stic has convicted him with those of us in the know. It is the true story of the Roswell crash taken from the confiscated diaries of James Forrestal. That is, assuming that the documents that I saw in the Navy were not a hoax. I do not believe that they were. The names of people and names of projects and operations have been changed in Strieber's book, but other than that the information and documentation is true. The autopsy reports are exactly the same that I saw in Project GRUDGE 18 years ago.

He spent the whole time, including his speech, trying to convince people of the innocence of th e abductee experience and the ab- sence of the aliens' malevolence, which was a total crock. It was an insult to anyone who had investigated abductees. I know that all of the major UFO res earch organizations were targeted for infiltration and control by the Se cret Government, just as NICAP was infiltrated and controlled. In fact, NICAP was eventually destroyed from within. I know that these e fforts have been successful. MUFON is a great example. Hundred s of members all over the world conduct investigations and send in physical evidence to MUFON head- quarters, where it quickly disappear s. Everyone screams for physical evidence as proof. Recently samples were collected of a liquid that had dripped from a saucer onto a schoolyard in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The samples were sent to MUFON, where they immediately vanished. Walt Andrus has stated that it was an acci dent. BALONEY! This is not the first time MUFON has \"lost\" evidence. I c onsider MUFON the great black hole of the UFO community. The control of information is so tight that nothing escapes. Anyone who tells it like it really is, is de bunked and barred from symposiums. The members are told what to believe and what not to believe. The members do not seem to know that they are being controlled. The members of the MUFON board of directors and the members of the advisory board of consultants are for the most part supported by the Government in the form of salaries, grants, or re tirement checks. Who can believe that this does no t constitute a conflict of interest? Who can inves- tigate and expose the ha nd that feeds them? Ho w can you possibly believe the Government could not control th e people to whom it funnels money? MONEY IS THE BASIC METHOD OF CONTROL. The major UFO publications are with out any doubt cont rolled and are most probably, as in the case with UFO, financially backed or controlled by the CIA. Vicki Cooper (no relation), the editor an d publisher of UFO, has been telling friends and relatives for at least two years that the CIA is pushing her magazine. Ron Regehr a nd Lee Graham remember the sum- mer of 1988 when Vicki interviewed them at Mr. Graham's residence in Huntington Beach. After the interview was over Vi cki Cooper walked to her car, turned, and mysteriously ye lled, \"You know, my magazine might be financed by the CIA.\""},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve The Secret Government • 231 I have talked to friends and ac quaintances of Ms. Cooper who swear that she has stated on many occasions that \"the CIA controls UFO maga- zine.\" Vicki Cooper's uncle, Grant C ooper, was Sirhan Sirhan's defense attorney, who made no attempt to defend his client. It was important to the Secret Government and the CIA that Sirhan be pinned as a \"lone assassin.\" Grant Cooper has extensive ties to the CIA and the Johnny Rosselli mob. We have found that Vicki's son attends the West Point Military Aca- demy. What a wonderful way to control a magazine! \"You don't play ball, your son won't graduate.\" I found out that the person who found Vicki Cooper an apartment when she arrived in Los Angeles was Barry Taff, a long-time employee of the intelligence agencies (yes, plural) and a long- time proteg) of Dr. John Lilly and Dr. J. West, the government's premiere experts in mind control. These men have been involved in the most terrify- ing, experimentation ever directed at total control of individuals. I believe that it is no innocent coincidence that Taff's apartment is directly above Vicki's. All of this was confirmed i ndependently in a letter written by Mr. Martin Cannon, a Los Angeles-based researcher. The letter can be found in the Appendix. The most damning evidence for th e control of UFO magazine and Vicki Cooper comes from Don Ecker. At the 1989 MUFON Conference Don Ecker became so uninhibited that he managed to relate the following story to me and two others. According to Don Ecker, Vicki Cooper used to work for the infamous Mayflower Madam. The Feds were trying to get the Madam and dis- covered Vicki. Ms. Cooper was busted and threatened with spending the rest of her life in prison if she did not cooperate. Vicki rolled over, accord- ing, to Ecker, and ratted on her empl oyer. Since Vicki had apparently had something to do with the bookkeeping operation, she became a key wit- ness. The Mayflower Madam was put out of business and into jail, thanks to Ms. Cooper's testimony. That is, if Don Ecker was telling the truth. We have no reason to believe that he was lying. I don't know why Don told us. Maybe he doesn't like Vickie. Or maybe he, like Lear and Friedman, thought I was one of them. (If 11 be a cold day in hell.) According to Ecker, Vicki Cooper was told to get out of town and stay out. She was given money and told to start UFO magazine in Los Angeles. She was told that she was to print in formation that would be fed to her. Sure enough, you read in UFO purported leaked government UFO infor- mation, always written by someone who cannot be contacted. It is always under an alias; no one can check the information.

The Boise Police Depart- ment, when asked by phone, has deni ed any knowledge of Mr. Ecker. I have requested that Don furnish a co py of his Army record, but he has refused. Ecker calls himself a UFO expert and has dubbed himself (yep, you guessed it) a \"ufologist.\" He sp rinkles terms like \"ufological\" around in his articles, and not even Don knows what the hell it means. He con- firms most of the information that I have divulged when he speaks to groups. He has furnished data bases with a plethora of files that confirm everything that I have ever said. Ec ker probably made them up himself, since they are all anonymous. He claims that aliens mutilate humans like cattle. Don Ecker, like Vicki Cooper, practices character assassination. According to legitimate law-enforcem ent sources, Ecker is lying to the public. He was a guard at the Idaho State Prison from September 1981 to September 1982 when he quit to become a Canyon County Sheriff's Department Narcotics Deputy Trainee. Donald Francis Ecker II was fired after only six weeks for \"improper conduct.\" Mr. Ecker returned to the Idaho State Prison where he was employed as a guard until July 1987 when he shot off his left leg with a shotgun during a training exercise. Sources also reveal that Donald Francis Ecke r II is a fugitive from justice. Author- ities in Idaho hold several outstanding warrants for the arrest of Mr. Ecker. You must understand that the government is not ever going to allow any person or any group of persons to uncover the most highly classified secret in the world — if they can help it. They will always have agents controlling UFO groups, publications a nd information. If aliens are not real and the whole thing turns out to be the greatest hoax ever perpetrated, just who do you think did the perpetrating? If the underground history is correct , aliens have manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult. The Counc il on Foreign Relations and the Tri- lateral Commission are in complete cont rol of the alien technology and are also in complete control of the na tion's economy. Eisenhower was the last President to know the entire overview of the alien problem. Succeeding Presidents were told only what Majesty Twelve and the intelligence com- munity wanted them to know. Believe me, it was not the truth. Majesty Twelve has presented most new Presidents with a picture of a lost alien culture seeking to renew itself, build a home on this planet, and shower us with gifts of technology.

In the documents that I read, 1 in 40 humans had been implanted with devices, the purpose of which I have never discovered. The Government believes that the aliens are building an army of implanted humans who can ne activated and turned upon us at will.

I sent 536 copies of a \"Petition to Indict\" to every member of the Senate and House of Representatives on April 26, 1989. As of this date, November 23,1990, I have received a total of only six replies, only four more than I had received in May 1989. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE INESCAPABLE: (1) The secret power structure may believe that by our own ignorance or by divine decree, planet Earth will self-destruct sometime in the near future. These men sincerely believe that they are doing the right thing in their attempt to save the human race. It is terribly ironic that they have been forced to take as their partner an alien race which is itself engaged in a monumental struggle for survival. Many moral and legal compromises may have been made in this joint effort. These compromises were made in error and must be corrected. Those responsible should be brought to account for their actions. I can understa nd the fear and urgency that must have been instrumental in the deci sion not to tell the public. Obviously I disagree with that decision. Throughout history small but powe rful groups of men have consis- tently felt that they alone were capa ble of deciding the fates of millions. Throughout history they have been wrong. This great Nation owes its very existence to the principles of Freedom and Democracy. I believe with all my heart that the United States of America cannot and will not succeed in any effort that ignores those principles. Full disclosure to the public should be made and we should proceed to save the human race together. (2) We are being manipulated by a joint human/alien power struc- ture which will result in a one-world government and the partial enslave- ment of the human race. This has been deemed necessary to solve the elemental question: \"Who will speak for planet Earth?\" It has been decided that man is not mature enough in his evolutionary development to be trusted to interact properly with an alien race.

Have our leaders decided to lock us in the playpen? The only way to prevent this scenario from taking place is to cause an evolutionary leap in consciousness, a paradigm shift for the entire human race. I have no idea how it can be done, but I know that it desperately needs to be done. It needs to be done very quickly and very quietly. (3) The government has been totally deceived and we are being manipulated by an alien po wer, which will result in the total enslavement and/or destruction of th e human race. We must use any and every means available to prevent this from happening. (4) If none of the above are true, so mething else may be happening which is beyond our ability to unders tand at this moment. We must force disclosure of all of the facts, discover the truth, and act upon it. The situation in which we find ourselves is due to our own ac tions or inactions over the last 44 years. Because it is our own fault, we are the only ones who can change future events. Education seem s to me to be a major part of the solution. The remaining part is the abolition of secrecy. (5) There is always the possibility that I was used, that the whole alien scenario is the greatest hoax in history designed to create an alien enemy from outer space in order to expedite the formation of a one-world government. I have found evidence that this could be true. I have in- cluded that evidence in the Appendix. I advise you to cons ider this scena- rio as being probable. Through ignorance or misplaced trus t we as a people have abdicated our role as the watchdog of our government. Our government was founded \"of the people, for the people, by the people.\" There was no mention or intent ever to abdicate our role and place our total trust in a handful of men who meet s ecretly to decide our fate. In fact, the structure of our government was desi gned to prevent that fr om ever happening. It we had done our jobs as Citizens we would never have reached this point Most of us are completely ignorant as to even the most basic functions of our government. We have tr uly become a nation of sheep — and sheep are always eventually led to slaughter. It is time to stand up in the manner of our forefathers and walk like men.

This is ALL of Article 25. Note the word \"present,\" indicating that th ere might be OTHER charters. The VETO was a hindrance to World Government — it had to be circumvented. In 1950 the General Assembly, without any legal authority, met and adopted what they named the \"UNITING FOR PEACE\" RESOLUTION.

Rix of Milwaukee, former president of the American Bar Association, before a Senate subcom- mittee which was hearing testimony on the proposed Bricker Amendment. It was entered into the House Reco rd by Hon. Lawrence H. Smith, Wiscon- sin, on May 11,1955. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (page A3220) Statement of Carl B. Rix, Milwaukee, Wisconsin: I appear in favor of the amendments. Congress is no longe r bound by its constitutiona l system of delegated powers. Its only test is under the obligatory power to promote human rights in these fields of endeavor: Civil, political , economic, social and cultural. These are found in Articles 55 and 56 of th e Charter of the United Nations, a ratified and approved treat y. They are being promoted in all parts of the world by the United Nations. Congress may now legislate as an uninhibited body with no shackles of delegated powers under the C onstitution. Our entire system of a government of delegated powers of Cong ress has been changed to a sys- tern of undelegated powers without amendment by the people of the United States. The authority for these statements is found in a volu me entitled Con- stitution of the United States of Americ a, Annotated, issued in 1953, prepared under the direction of the Judiciary Co mmittee of the Senate of the United States and under the chairmanship of Prof. Edward S. Corwin of Princeton, aided by the legal staff of the Library of Congress. This is the conclusion on page 427 of the Annotati ons: \"In a word, the trea ty power cannot purport to amend the Constitution by adding to the list of Congress' enumerated powers, but having acted, the consequence will often be that it has provided Congress with an opportunity to enact measures which, inde- pendently of a treaty, Congress could no t pass, and the only question that can be raised as to such measures will be whethe r they are 'necessary and proper' measures for the ca rrying of the treaty in question into operation.\" It will be noted that one of the principal cases cited is that of the Migratory Bird case. These conclusions are those also of a committee of the New York State Bar Association, of which former Attorney General Mitchell and Mr. J ohn W. Davis were prominent members.

That is the exact situation in which Justice Holmes found himself and the other members of the Supreme Court when they decided the Migratory Bird case. The authority was not found in the Constitution — it was found in the treaty with Great Britain. The question to be answered is th is: Under which form of government do the people of the United States prefer to live? Manifestly, we cannot operate under both.

Did they not expect PATRIOTS, rather than Treasonists as our elected officials, to HONOR AND ENFORCE the spirit, letter, and intent of the Constitution? I note you say that according to a law dictionary, the terms \"legal\" and \"lawful\" are almost one and the same. Agreed! \"Almost,\" but not quite. I believe there is a fine point of diffe rence. Taking us into the U.N. may SEEM to have been done legally (by th e President and Senate), but the act is still unlawful, because it is unconstitutional, and the CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. All renowned and genuine Con- stitutional experts (such as Thos. M. Cooley, Thos. Jas. Norton, and Harry Atwood, to name several) have always held that anything which con- travenes, diminishes, or perverts the Constitution is null and void and of no effect. Neither the President or Senate has authority or power to change, diminish, or destroy the Constitution \"by usurpation,\" treaty, or otherwise: only a Constitutional Amendment can lawfully change it. The Constitution is a contract that WE THE PEOPLE of the USA made with one another, which sets up the machinery of government to carry out this contract —mainly for the purpose of PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS as well as STATE RIGHTS, AGAINST THE POWERS OF GOVERNMENT: and no public official has a right to override the provisions of that contract. To quote Thos. Jas. Norton's Constitution of the United States, Its Application, etc., \"A law of Congress to be one of the supreme laws must be 'made in pursu ance thereof and not in conflict with the Constitution. When not made in pursuance thereof it is of course unconstitutional and of no effect.\" And the same would similarly apply to a wonderful decision rendered by the Supreme Court or an unlawful Treaty. And from Norton's Undermining the Constitution, which quotes Alexander Hamilton in No. 33 of The Federalist: \"It will not, I presume, have escaped observation that it expressly confines the supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution\" (emphasis by Hamilton). And from page 21, \"The General Government can claim no powers which are not granted to it by the Constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are expressly given, or given by necessary implication.\" Anyone with the presumed intelligence to be President of the USA must know that he cannot lawfully make any such far-reaching treaty with"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Treason in High Places • 245 the United Nations, or any other foreign power, as you envision by your language, without laying himself open to the charge of TREASON under ARTICLE III, Section 3 of the Constitution.

Such a Treaty makes a mockery of an y genuine allegiance to OUR Flag and Constitution. A genuine American , Abraham Lincoln, said, \"Worse than traitors-in-arms are the men who, pretending loyalty to the Flag, feast and fatten on the misfortunes of the nation.\" Think of any TRUTH more applicable to the present time? A number of our officials, including former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, the late John Foster Dulles, and members of our present one- world Kennedy entourage go along with the statement that the USA now has NO \"domestic\" affairs: there has been a melding of our domestic and foreign affairs! (Meld means to merge.) Katanga Province in the Congo thought she had some private affairs and rights, but the U.N. soon disillusioned her. Quote from S.L. Tribune for September 14,1961: \"U.N. Soldiers Ta ke Over in Katanga. U.N. troops seized Katanga's capital, Elisabethville, in a brisk battle Wednesday, and the Congo's central government proclaimed the return of that secessionist province.\" There is no doubt that the President of the USA and Senate have surrendered certain of our rights and Sovereignty to the U.N., and plan still more. Any informed American is aware that ARTICLE IV, Section 4, of the Constitution automatically cancels out any allegiance to the U.N. and its alien one-world Internationalism, the antithesis of Constitutional Americanism founded on Washington' s \"NO foreign entanglements.\" And that said republican representative form of government is the exact opposite of the U.N. Charter's Soviet-in itiated modifications, restrictions, and reservations in its various \"Conve ntions\" which would nullify our Bill of Rights. Stalin, his protege, Alger Hiss, and Russian Communist Pas- volsky figured largely in the writing of the U.N. Charter. To assume that a heterogeneous body composed of appointed repre- sentatives of foreign governments (some from crude cannibalistic so-called \"States\" and others, from virulently atheistic Communist States) — which Governments DO NOT REPRESENT \"We the American People\" — could exercise dictation and control over U.S. is monstrous in the extreme.

Q uoting Norton's Constitu- tion of the United States, at page 14: \"A treaty is a written contract between two governments (not a motley assembly of unstable trib es, or enslaved peoples calling themselves a 'government') respecting matters of mutual welfare, such as peace, the acouisition of territory, the defining of boun- daries, the needs of trade, rights of citizenship...\" etc. And such treaties, even though \"legally made,\" MAY be abrogated for cause. Quoting ibid, p. 115: \"A precedent for thus abrogating a treaty made by the President and approv ed by the Senate may be found as far back as July 7, 1789, when Congress passed 'An Act to Declare the Treaties heretofore concluded with France no longer obligatory on the United States because they have been repeatedly violated on the part of the French government.\" So what about all the violations of the treaties or agree- ments made by the USSR, which domina tes the U.N.? The USA is vastly outvoted in this motley aggregation called the United Nations, even as American taxpayers foot most of the bills, wh ich constitutes Constitution- ally forbidden confiscation of the citi zens' money (property) without just compensation therefore. This is merely communistic confiscation. A Treaty made \"pursuant to the Cons titution\" becomes A PART of the LAW OF THE LAND, and should be honored; but it does NOT become \"Supreme\" or take precedence over nor supersede the Constitution. It is NOT the \"Law of the Land\" standing alone. And NO Treaty or Executive Agreement is binding on the USA if made by the President alone (as has been done) with the advice and consent of th e Senate, nor if it violates the Constitution. Actually, ARTICLE VI, in stead of setting Treatie s on high or being a \"death trap,\" is a statement of the SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITU- TION and of the NATION AL GOVERNMENT. Lawful Treaties are a part of, but subordinate to, the Constituti on for the simple stated provision therein that ALL laws and treaties must be made \"in pursuance thereof.\" Can the \"creature\" (or a part) beco me greater than its CREATOR, or the whole???

The language and intent of the Constitution and of ARTICLE VI is"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Chapter Thirteen Treason in High Places • 247 clear and forthright, and does not admit, in good faith, of any other inter- pretation. But sadly enough, it is well known that many of our highest judiciary and elected officials — in th is era of TREASON, not Reason — do not act in good faith nor in \"pursuance of the Constitution.\" With reference to fourth paragrap h your letter Oct. 12th, Mr. Newby, that the \"making of treatie s is without limitation, exception or reservation\" and that \"no treaty has ever been d eclared unconstitutional or invalidated or repealed by the Courts or Congress in the history of this nation,\" I think that the foregoing inva lidates your statement. And as to ARTICLE VI being a \"d eathtrap\" over whic h the Constitu- tion gives no control or remedy othe r than its explicit language in VI regarding the law and tr eaties: has it occurred to you that the Supreme Court has power and authority to ru le on the constitutionality of treaties the same as on the constitutionality of any other law — treaties being merely \"part of the Law of the Land\"? ARTICLE III, Section 2 explicitly states: \"The Judicial power shall ex tend to all cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitutio n, the Laws of the Unit ed States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority.\" To quote Norton's Constitution of the United States, page 137: \"When a case arises in a State court and involves a question of the Constitution, or an Act of Congress, or of a treaty, it is the duty of the c ourt to follow and enforce the National [Constitional] law; fo r the Constitution explicitly and emphatically re- quires that the 'judges in every Stat e shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the cont rary notwithstanding.'\" Any time that the President and Se nate make a treaty with a foreign power (such as the U.N.) which infringes upon or ab rogates rights guaran- teed citizens of the USA under the Constitutio n, the Suprem e Court can declare such treaty unconstit utional, void, and of no effect. Of course, the present Supreme Court, be ing composed of political radicals rather than judicial Constitutional experts, is not likely to take such action — unless forced to do so by public opinion and demand. And so, with reference to your st atement in printed CHALLENGE for November, 1961, to the effect that, \"u nder ARTICLE II, Section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution...such treaty (as w ith the U.N.) can be made without restriction, limitation, ex ception or reservation irre spective of the fact that it contravenes, violates, infringes or al ienates every articl e of the Constitu- tion. All that is necessary is for th e President and Senate to ratify ANY treaty and it is in forc e.\" The above article and clause likewise does not stand alone, but must be construed in the light of the entire Constitution.

Putting aside fine phrases we shall speak of the significance of each thought: by comparisons and deductions we shall throw light upon surrounding facts. What I am about to set forth, then, is our system from the two points of view, that of ourselves a nd that of the goyim (i.e., non-Jews). It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in number than the good, and therefore the be st results in governing them are attained by violence and terrorisation, and not by academic discussions. Every man aims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indeed are the men who would not be willing to sacrifice the welfare of all for the sake of securing their own welfare. What has restrained the beasts of prey who are called men? What has served for their guidance hitherto? In the beginnings of the structur e of society they were subjected to brutal and blind force; afterw ards—to Law, which is the same force, only disguised. I draw the c onclusion that by the law of nature right lies in force. Political freedom is an idea but not a fact. This idea one must know how to apply whenever it appears necessary with this bait of an idea to attract the masses of the people to one's party for the purpose of crushing another who is in authority. This task is rendered easier if the opponent has himself b een infected with the idea of freedom, so-called liberalism, and, fo r the sake of an idea, is willing"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion 269 to yield some of his power. It is precisely here that the triumph of our theory appears: the slackened re ins of government are immediately, by the law of life, caught up and gathered together by a new hand, because the blind might of the nation cannot for one single day exist without guidance, and the new author ity merely fits into the place of the old already weakened by liberalism. In our day the power which has replaced that of the rulers who were liberal is the power of Gold. Time was when Faith ruled. The idea of freedom is impossible of re alisation because no one knows how to use it with moderation. It is e nough to hand over a people to self- government for a certain length of tim e for that people to be turned into a disorganised mob. From that moment on we get internecine strife which soon develops into battl es between classes, in the midst of which States burn down and thei r importance is reduced to that of a heap of ashes. Whether a State exhausts itself in its own convulsions, whether its internal discord brings it under the power of external foes—in any case it can be accounted irretrievably lost: it is in our power. The despotism of Capital, which is entirely in our hands, reaches out to it a straw that the State, willy-nilly, must take hold of: if not—it goes to the bottom. Should anyone of a liberal mind say that such reflections as the above are immoral I would put the following questions:—If every State has two foes and if in regard to the external foe it is allowed and not considered immoral to use every manner and art of conflict, as for example to keep the enemy in ignorance of plans of attack and defence, to attack him by night or in superior numbers, then in what way can the same means in regard to a worse foe, the destroyer of the structure of society and the comm onweal, be called immoral and not permissible? Is it possible for any sound logical mind to hope with any success to guide crowds by the aid of reasonable counsels and arguments, when any objection or contradiction, se nseless though it may be, can be made and when such objection may find more favour with the people whose powers of reasoning are supe rficial? Men in masses and the men of the masses, being guided solely by petty passions, paltry beliefs customs, traditions and sentimental theorism, fall a prey to party dis- tention, which hinders any kind of agreement even on the basis of a"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"270 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper perfectly reasonable argument. Every resolution of a crowd depends upon a chance or packed majority, which, in its ignorance of political secrets, puts forth some ridiculous resolution that lays in the admin- istration a seed of anarchy. The political has nothing in common with the moral. The ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician, and is there- fore unstable on his throne. He who wi shes to rule must have recourse both to cunning and to make-belie ve. Great national qualities, like frankness and honesty, are vices in politics, for they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and more certainly than the most powerful enemy. Such qualities must be the attributes of the kingdoms of the goyim, but we must in no wise be guided by them. Our right lies in force. The word \"right\" is an abstract thought and proved by nothing. The word means no more than:—Give me what I want in order that thereby I might have a proof that I am stronger than you. Where does right begin? Where does it end? In any State in which there is a bad organisation of authority, an impersonality of laws and of the rule rs who have lost their personality amid the flood of rights ever multiplying out of liberalism, I find a new right—to attack by the right of the strong, and to scatter to the winds all existing forces of order and regulation, to reconstruct all institutions and to become the sovereign lord of those who have left to us the rights of their power by laying them down voluntarily in their liberalism. Our power in the present tottering condition of all forms of power will be more invincible than any other, because it will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer undermine it. Out of the temporary evil we are now compelled to commit will emerge the good of an unshakeable rule, which will re store the regular course of the machinery of the national life, brought to naught by liberalism. The result justifies the means. Let us, however, in our plans, direct our attention not so much to what is good and moral as to what is necessary and useful. Before us is a plan in which is laid down strategically the line from which we cannot deviate without running the risk of seeing the labour of many centuries brought to naught."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 271 In order to elaborate satisfactory forms of action it is necessary to have regard to the rascality, the slackness, the instability of the mob, its lack of capacity to understand and respect the conditions of its own life, or its own welfare. It must be understood that the might of a mob is blind, senseless and unreasoning force ever at the mercy of a suggestion from any side. The blin d cannot lead the blind without bringing them into the abyss; c onsequently, members of the mob, upstarts from the people even though they should be as a genius for wisdom, yet having no understanding of the political, cannot come forward as leaders of the mob w ithout bringing the whole nation to ruin. Only one trained from childhood for independent rule can have understanding of the words that can be made up of the political alphabet. A people left to itself, i.e., to upstarts from its midst, brings itself to ruin by party dissensions excited by the pursuit of power and honours and disorders arising therefrom. Is it possible for the masses of the people calmly and without petty jealousies to form judgments, to deal with the affairs of the country, which cannot be mixed up with personal interests? Can they defend themselves from an external foe? It is unthinkable, for a plan broken up into as many parts as there are heads in the mob, loses all homogeneity, and thereby becomes unintelligible and impossible of execution. It is only with a despotic ruler that plans can be elaborated exten- sively and clearly in such a way as to distribute the whole properly among the several parts of the machin ery of the State: from this the conclusion is inevitable that a satisfactory form of government for any country is one that concentrates in the hands of one responsible person. Without an absolute despo tism there can be no existence for civilisation which is carried on not by the masses but by their guide, whosoever that person may be. The m ob is a savage and displays its savagery at every opportunity. The moment the mob seizes freedom in its hands it quickly turns to anarchy, which in itself is the highest degree of savagery. Behold the alcoholised animals, be mused with drink, the right to an immoderate use of which comes along with freedom. It is not for us and ours to walk that road. The peoples of the goyim are bemused with alcoholic liquors; their youth has grown stupid on classicism and"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"272 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper from early immorality, into which it has been inducted by our special agents—by tutors, lackeys, governesse s in the houses of the wealthy, by clerks and others, by our women in the places of dissipation fre- quented by the goyim. In the number of these last I count also the so-called \"society ladies,\" voluntar y followers of the others in cor- ruption and luxury. Our countersign is—Force and Make -believe. Only force conquers in political affairs, especially if it be concealed in the talents essential to statesmen. Violence must be the principle, and cunning and make- believe the rule for governments wh ich do not want to lay down their crowns at the feet of agents of so me new power. This evil is the one and only means to attain the end, the good. Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and treachery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end. In politi cs one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure submission and sovereignty. Our State, marching along the path of peaceful conquest, has the right to replace the horrors of wa r by less noticeable and more satis- factory sentences of death, necessary to maintain the terror which tends to produce blind submission. Ju st but merciless severity is the greatest factor of strength in the State: not only for the sake of gain but also in the name of duty, for th e sake of victory, we must keep to the programme of violence and make-believe. The doctrine of squaring accounts is precisely as st rong as the means of which it makes use. Therefore it is not so much by the means themselves as by the doctrine of severity that we shal l triumph and bring all governments into subjection to our super-govern ment. It is enough for them to know that we are merciless fo r all disobedien ce to cease. Far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the masses of the people the words \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" words many times repeated since those days by stupid poll-parrots who from all sides round flew down upon these ba its and with them carried away the well-being of the world, true fre edom of the individual, formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the mob. The would-be wise men of the goyim, the intellectuals, could not make anything out of the uttered words in their abstractness; did not note the contradiction of their meaning and inter-relation: did not see that in nature there is no equality, cannot be freedom: th at Nature herself has established"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 273 inequality of minds, of characters, and capacities, just as immutably as she has established subordination to her laws: never stopped to think that the mob is a blind thing, th at upstarts elected from among it to bear rule are, in regard to the political, the same blind men as the mob itself, that the adept, though he be a fool, can yet rule, whereas the non-adept, even if he were a genius, understands nothing in the political—to all these things the goyim paid no regard; yet all the time it was based upon these things that dynastic rule rested: the father passed on to the son a knowledge of the course of political affairs in such wise that none should know it but members of the dynasty and none could betray it to the governed. As time went on the meaning of the dynastic transference of the true position of affairs in the polit- ical was lost, and this aided the success of our cause. In all corners of the earth the words \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" brought to our ranks, thanks to our blind agents, whole legions who bore our banners with enthusiasm. A nd all the time these words were canker-worms at work boring into the well-being of the goyim, putting an end everywhere to peace, quiet, solidarity and destroying all the foundations of the goy States. As you will see later, this helped us to our triumph; it gave us the possibility, among other things, of getting into our hands the master card—the destruction of the privi- leges, or in other words of the very existence of the aristocracy of the goyim, that class which was the only defence peoples and countries had against us. On the ruins of the natural and genealogical aristocracy of the goyim we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class headed by the aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this aris- tocracy we have established in we alth, which is dependent upon us, and in knowledge, for which our learned elders provide the motive force. Our triumph has been rendered easier by the fact that in our rela- tions with the men whom we want ed we have always worked upon the most sensitive chords of the human mind, upon the cash account, upon the cupidity, upon the insatiability for material needs of man; and each one of these human weakne sses, taken alone, is sufficient to paralyse initiative, for it hands over the will of men to the disposition of him who has bought their activities. The abstraction of freedom has enab led us to persuade the mob in all countries that their government is nothing but the steward of the"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"274 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper people who are the owners of the country, and that the steward may be replaced like a worn-out glove. It is this possibility of replacing the representatives of the people which has placed them at our disposal, and, as it were, given us the power of appointment. PROTOCOL NO . 2 It is indispensable for our purpose that wars, so far as possible, should not result in territorial gains: war will thus be brought on to the economic ground, where the nations will not fail to perceive in the assistance we give the strength of our predominance, and this state of things will put both sides at the mercy of our international agentur; which possesses millions of eyes ever on the watch and unhampered by any limitations whatsoever. Our international rights will then wipe out national rights, in the proper sense of right, and will rule the nations precisely as the civil law of States rules the relations of their subjects among themselves. The administrators, whom we shall choose from among the public, with strict regard to their capacities for servile obedience, will not be persons trained in the arts of government, and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the ha nds of men of learning and genius who will be their advisers, specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world. As is well known to you, these specialists of ours ha ve been drawing to fit them for rule the information they need from our political plans, from the lessons of history, from observations made of the events of every moment as it passes. The goyim ar e not guided by practical use of unprejudiced historical observation, but by theoretical routine without any critical regard for consequent results. We need not, therefore, take any account of them—let them amuse themselves until the hour strikes, or live on hopes of new form s of enterprising pastime, or on the memories of all they have enjoyed. For them let that play the principal part which we have persuaded them to accept as the dictates of science (theory). It is with this object in view that we are con- stantly, by means of our press, arousing a blind confidence in these theories.

Do not suppose for a moment that th ese statements ar e empty words: think carefully of the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzsche-ism. To us Jews, at any ra te, it should be plain to see what a disintegrating importance these di rectives have had upon the minds of the goyim. It is indispensable for us to take account of the thoughts, characters, tendencies of the nations in order to avoid making slips in the political and in the direction of administra tive affairs. The triumph of our system, of which the component parts of the machinery may be vari- ously disposed according to the temperament of the peoples met on our way, will fail of success if th e practical application of it be not based upon a summing up of the lessons of the past in the light of the present. In the hands of the States of to-day there is a great force that creates the movement of thought in th e people, and that is the Press. The part played by the Press is to keep pointing out requirements supposed to be indispensable, to gi ve voice to the complaints of the people, to express and to create discontent. It is in the Press that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its incarnation. But the goyim States have not known how to make us e of this force; and it has fallen into our hands. Through the Press we have gained the power to influence while remaining ourselves in the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the gold in our hands, notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out of oceans of blood and tears.

But the pivots—the kings on their thrones—are hemmed in by their represent- atives, who play the fool, distraught with their own uncontrolled and irresponsible power. Th is power they owe to the terror which has been breathed into the palaces. As they have no means of getting at their people, into their very midst, the kings on their thrones are no longer able to come to terms with them and so strengthen themselves against seekers after power. We have made a gulf between the far- seeing Sovereign Power and the blind force of the people so that both have lost all meaning, for like the blind man and his stick, both are powerless apart. In order to incite seekers after power to a misuse of power we have set all forces in opposition one to another, breaking up their liberal tendencies towards independence. To th is end we have stirred up every form of enterprise, we have armed a ll parties, we have set up authority as a target for every ambition. Of States we have made gladiatorial arenas where a host of confused issues contend .... A little more, and disorders and bankruptcy will be universal. . . .

All these so-called \"People's Rights\" can exist only in idea, an idea which can never be realised in practical life.

The people under our guidance have annihilated the aristocracy, who were their one and only defenc e and foster-mother for the sake of their own advantage which is inseparably bound up with the well- being of the people. Nowadays, with the destruction of the aristocracy, the people have fallen into the gr ips of merciless money-grinding scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers. We appear on the scene as alleged saviours of the worker from this oppression when we propose to him to enter the ranks of our fighting forces—Socialists, Anarchists, Comm unists—to whom we always give support in accordance with an allege d brotherly rule (of the solidarity of all humanity) of our social mas onry. The aristocracy, which enjoyed by law the labour of the workers, wa s interested in seeing that the workers were well fed, healthy and st rong.

It is essential for all to know that owing to difference in the objects of human activity there cannot be any equality, that he who by any act of his compromises a whole cl ass cannot be equally responsible before the law with him who affect s no one but only his own honour. The true knowledge of the structure of society, into the secrets of which we do not admit the goyim, would demonstrate to all men that the positions and work must be kept within a certain circle, that they may not become a source of human su ffering, arising from an education which does not correspond with the work which individuals are called upon to do. After a thorough study of this knowledge the peoples will voluntarily submit to authority and accept such position as is appointed them in the State. In the present state of knowledge and the direction we have given to its development th e people, blindly believing things in print—cherishes—thanks to prom ptings intended to mislead and to its own ignorance—a blind hatred towards all conditions which it considers above itself, for it has no understanding of the meaning of class and condition. This hatred will be still further magnified by the effects of an economic crisis, which will stop de alings on the exchanges and bring industry to a standstill. We shall crea te by all the secret subterranean methods open to us and with the aid of gold, which is all in our hands, a universal economic crisis whereb y we shall throw upon the streets whole mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of Europe.

Ever since that time we have be en leading the peoples from one disenchantment to another, so that in the end they should turn also from us in favour of that King-Despot of the blood of Zion, whom we are preparing for the world. At the present day we are, as an international force, invincible, because if attacked by some we are supported by other States. It is the bottomless rascality of the go yim peoples, who crawl on their bellies to force, but are mercile ss towards weakness, unsparing to faults and indulgent to crimes, un willing to bear the contradictions of a free social system but pati ent unto martyrdom under the violence of a bold despotism—it is those qualities which are aiding us to independence. From the premier-dictators of the present day the goyim peoples suffer patiently and bear such abuses as for the least of them they would have beheaded twenty kings.

But if they be not given blood they will not sleep and continue to struggle. PROTOCOL NO. 4 Every republic passes through several stages. The first of these is comprised in the early days of mad raging by the blind mob, tossed hither and thither, right and left: the second is demagogy, from which is born anarchy, and that leads inev itably to despotism—not any longer legal and overt, and therefore res ponsible despotism, but to unseen and secretly hidden, yet neverthele ss sensibly felt despotism in the hands of some secret organisation or other, whose acts are the more unscrupulous inasmuch as it works behind a screen, behind the backs of all sorts of agents, the changing of whom not only does not injuriously affect but actually aids th e secret force by saving it, thanks to continual changes, from the necessity of expending its resources on the rewarding of long services. Who and what is in a position to overthrow an invisible force? And this is precisely what our force is . Gentile masonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of action of our force, even its very abiding-place, remains for the whole people an unknown mystery. But even freedom might be harmless and have its place in the State economy without injury to the well-be ing of the peoples if it rested upon the foundation of faith in God, upon the brotherhood of humanity, unconnected with the c onception of equality, which is negatived by the very laws of creati on, for they have established sub- ordination.

Thus, all the nations will be swallowed up in the pursuit of gain and in the race for it will not take note of their common foe. But again, in order that freedom may once for all disintegrate and ruin the communities of the goyim, we must put industry on a speculative basis: the result of this will be that what is withdrawn from the land by industry will slip through the hands and pass into speculation, that is, to our classes. The intensified struggle for superior ity and shocks delivered to eco- nomic life will create, nay, have already created, disenchanted, cold and heartless communities. Such communities will foster a strong aversion towards the higher political and towards religion. Their only guide is gain, that is Gold, which they will erect into a veritable cult, for the sake of those material delights which it can give.

We shall be told that such a des potism as I speak of is not con- sistent with the progress of these days, but I will prove to you that it is. In the times when the peoples looked upon kings on their thrones as on a pure manifestation of the wi ll of God, they submitted without a murmur to the despotic power of kings: but from the day when we insinuated into their minds the conception of their own rights they began to regard the occupants of th rones as mere ordinary mortals. The holy unction of the Lord's Anointed has fallen from the heads of kings in the eyes of the people, and when we also robbed them of their faith in God the might of power was flung upon the streets into the place of public proprie torship and was seized by us. Moreover, the art of directing ma sses and individuals by means of cleverly manipulated theory and verbiage, by regulations of life in common and all sorts of other quirks, in all which the goyim under- stand nothing, belongs like wise to the specialists of our administrative brain. Reared on analysis, observation, on delicacies of fine calculation, in this species of skill we have no rivals, any more than we have either in the drawing up of plans of political actions and solidarity. In this respect the Jesuits alone mi ght have compared with us, but we have contrived to discredit them in the eyes of the unthinking mob as an overt organisation, while we ourse lves all the while have kept our secret organisation in the shade. However, it is probably all the same to the world who is its sovereign lord, whether the head of Catholicism or our despot of the blood of Zion! But to us, the Chosen People, it is very far from being a matter of indifference. For a time perhaps we might be suc cessfully dealt with by a coalition of the GOYIM of all the world: but from this danger we are secured by the discord existing among them wh ose roots are so deeply seated that they can never now be plucked up. We have set one against another the personal and national reckonings of the goyim, religious and race hatreds, which we have fostered into a huge growth in the course of the past twenty centuries. This is the reason why there is not one State which would anywhere receive support if it were to raise its arm, for every one of them must bear in mind that any agreement against us would be unprofitable to itse lf.

The nations cannot come to even an inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand in it. Per Me reges regnant. \"It is thr ough Me that Kings reign.\" And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God Himself to rule over the whole earth. God has e ndowed us with genius that we may be equal to our task. Were ge nius in the opposite camp it would still struggle against us, but even so a newcomer is no match for the old-established settler: the struggl e would be merciless between us, such a fight as the world has never yet seen. Aye, and the genius on their side would have arrived too la te. All the wheels of the machinery of all States go by the force of the engine, which is in our hands, and that engine of the machinery of States is—Gold. The science of political economy invented by our learned elders has for long past been giving royal prestige to capital. Capital, if it is to co-operate untrammelled, must be free to establish a monopoly of industry and trade: this is already being put in execu- tion by an unseen hand in all quarters of the world. This freedom will give political force to those engaged in industry, and that will help to oppress the people. Nowadays it is more important to disarm the peoples than to lead them into war: more important to use for our advantage the passions which have burst into flames than to quench their fire: more important to catch up and interpret the ideas of others to suit ourselves than to eradicate them. The principal object of our directorate consists in this: to de bilitate the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to distract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquence. In all ages the peoples of the worl d, equally with individuals, have accepted words for deeds, for they are content with a show and rarely pause to note, in the public arena, whether promises are followed by performance. Therefore we shall establish show institutions which will give eloquent proof of their benefit to progress. We shall assume to ourselves the liberal physiognomy of all parties, of all directions, and we shall give that physiognomy a voice in orators who will speak so much that they will exhaust the patience of their hearers and produce an abhorrence of oratory. In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"284 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper a state of bewilderment by giving expression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such le ngth of time as will suffice to make the GOYIM lose their heads in the labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in matters political, which it is not given to the public to understand, because they are understood only by him who guides the public. This is the first secret. The second secret requisite for the success of our government is comprised in the following: To mu ltiply to such an extent national failings, habits, passions, conditions of civil life, that it will be impossible for anyone to know where he is in the resulting chaos, so that the people in consequence will fail to understand one another. This measure will also serve us in another way, namely, to sow discord in all parties, to dislocate all collective forces which are still unwilling to submit to us, and to discourage any kind of personal initiative which might in any degree hinder our affair. There is nothing more danger- ous than personal initiative; if it has genius behind it, such initiative can do more than can be done by millions of people among whom we have sown discord. We must so direct the education of the goyim communities that whenever they come upon a matter requiring initia- tive they may drop their hands in despairing impotence. The strain which results from freedom of action saps the forces when it meets with the freedom of another. From this collision arise grave moral shocks, disenchantments, failures. By all these means toe shall so wear down the goyim that they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the State forces of the world and to form a Super-Government. In place of the rulers of to-day we shall set up a bogey which will be called the Super-Government Admin- istration. Its hands will reach out in all directions like nippers and its organisation will be of such co lossal dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the nations of the world.

You gentlemen here present who are economists, just strike an estimate of the significance of this combination! . . . In every possible way we must develop the significance of our Super-Government by representing it as the Protector and Benefactor of all those who voluntarily submit to us. The aristocracy of the goyim as a political force, is dead—we need not take it into account; but as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are self-sufficing in the resources upon which they live. It is essential therefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land. This object will be best attained by increasing the burdens upon landed property—in loading lands with debts. These measures will check land-holding and keep it in a state of humble and unconditional submission. The aristocrats of the goyim, being hereditarily incapable of con- tenting themselves with little, will rapidly burn up and fizzle out. At the same time we must intensively patronise trade and industry, but, first and foremost, speculation, the part played by which is to provide a counterpoise to industry: the absence of speculative industry will multiply capital in private hands and will serve to restore agri- culture by freeing the land from indebtedness to the land banks. What we want is that industry s hould drain off from the land both labour and capital and by means of speculation transfer into our hands all the money of the world, and thereby throw all the goyim into the ranks of the proletariat. Then the goyim will bow down before us, if for no other reason but to get the right to exist. To complete the ruin of the industry of the goyim we shall bring to the assistance of speculation the luxury which we have developed among the goyim, that greedy demand for luxury which is swallowing up everything. We shall raise the rate of wages which, however, will not bring any advantage to the work ers, for, at the same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of the first necessaries of life, alleging that it arises from the decline of agriculture and cattle-breeding: we shall further undermine artfully and deeply sources of production, by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkenness and side by side therewith taking all measure to extirpate from the face of the earth all the educated forces of the GOYIM .

What we have to get at is that ther e should be in all the States of the world, besides ourselves, only the masses of the prol etariat, a few millionaires devoted to our interests, police and soldiers. Throughout all Europe, and by mean s of relations with Europe, in other continents also, we must create ferments, discords and hos- tility. Therein we gain a double advant age. In the first place we keep in check all countries, for they well know that we have the power whenever we like to create disorders or to restore order. All these countries are accustomed to see in us an indispensable force of coercion. In the second place, by our intrigue s we shall tangle up all the threads which we have stretched into the cabinets of all States by means of politics, by economic treaties, or loan obligations. In order to succeed in this we must use great cunni ng and penetration during negotia- tions and agreements, but, as regards what is called the \"official language,\" we shall keep to the oppos ite tactics and assume the mask of honesty and compliancy. In this way the peoples and governments of the goyim, whom we have taught to look only at the outside of what- ever we present to their notice, will still continue to accept us as the benefactors and saviours of the human race. We must be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbours of that country which dares to oppose us: but if these neighbours should also vent ure to stand coll ectively together against us, then we must offer resistance by a universal war. The principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertakings: the word should not agree with the deeds of the diplomat.

The administrators of the goyim sign papers without reading them, and they serve either for mercenary reasons or from ambition. We shall surround our government with a whole world of econ- omists.

But by approaching their application cautiously you will see that not a decade will pass before the most stubborn character will change and we shall add a new people to the ranks of those already subdued by us. The words of the liberal, which are in effect the words of our masonic watchword, namely, \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" will, when we come into our kingdom, be changed by us into words no longer of a watchword, but only an expression of idealism, namely, into: \"The\" right of liberty, the duty of equality, the ideal of brother- hood.\" That is how we shall put it,—and so we shall catch the bull by the horns. . . .

We rule by force of will, because in our hands are the fragments of a once powerful party, now vanquished by us. And the weapons in our hands are limitless ambitions, burning greediness, mercil ess vengeance, hatreds and malice. It is from us that the all-engul fing terror proceeds. We have in our service fersons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating mon- archists, demagogues, socialists, co mmunists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all establishe d form of order. By these acts all States are in torture; they exhort to tranquillity, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace: but we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our internati onal Super-Government, and with submissiveness. The people have raised a howl about the necessity of settling the question of Socialism by way of an international agreement. Division into fractional parties has given them into our hands, for, in order to carry on a contested struggle one must have money, and the money is all in our hands. We might have reason to apprehend a union between the \"clear- sighted\" force of the goy kings on their thrones and the \"blind\" force of the goy mobs, but we have taken all the needful measure against any such possibility: between the one and the other force we have erected a bulwark in the shape of a mutual terror between them. In this way the blind force of the people remains our support and we, and we only, shall provide th em with a leader and, of course, direct them along the road that leads to our goal.

These springs lay in a strict but just sens e of order; we have replaced them by the chaotic license of liberalism. We have got our hands into the administration of the law, into the conduct of elections, into the press, into liberty of the person, but principally into education and training as being the corner-stones of a free existence. We have fooled, bemused and corrupted the youth of the GOYIM by rearing them in principles and theories which are known to us to be false although it is by. us th at they have been inculcated. Above the existing laws without substantially altering them, and by merely twisting them into contradi ctions of interpretations, we have erected something grandiose in the way of results. These results found expression first in the fact that the interpretations masked the laws: afterwards they entirely hid them from the eyes of the governments owing to the impossibility of making anything out of the tangled web of legislation. This is the origin of the theory of course of arbitration. You may say the goyim will rise upon us, arms in hand, if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against this a manoeuvre of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail—the undergrounds, metropolitains, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organisations and archives.

And how, indeed, are the goyim to perceive the underlying meaning of things when their representa- tives give the best of their energies to enjoying themselves? For our policy it is of the greatest importance to take cognisance of this detail; it will be of assistance to us when we come to consider the division of authority, freedom of speech, of the press, of religion (faith), of the law of association, of equality before the law, of the inviola- bility of property, of the dwelling, of taxation (the idea of concealed"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"C hapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 291 taxes), of the reflex force of the laws. All these questions are such as ought not to be touched upon directly and openly before the people. In cases where it is indispensable to touch upon them they must not be categorically named, it must merely be declared without detailed exposition that the principles of contemporary law are acknowledged by us. The reason of keeping silence in this respect is that by not naming a principle we leave ourselves freedom of action, to drop this or that out of it without attracting notice; if they were all categorically named they would all appear to have been already given. The mob cherishes a special affection and respect for the geniuses of political power and accepts all their deeds of violence with the admiring response: \"rascally, well, yes, it is rascally, but it's clever! ... a trick, if you like, but how craftily played, how magnificently done, what impudent audacity!\" . . . We count upon attractin g all nations to the task of erecting the new fundamental structure, the pr oject for which has been drawn up by us. This is why, before ever ything, it is indispensable for us to arm ourselves and to store up in ourselves that absolutely reckless audacity and irresistible might of th e spirit which in the person of our active workers will break down all hindrances on our way. When we have accomplished our coup d'etat we shall say then to the various peoples: \"Everything has go ne terribly badly, all have been worn out with sufferings. We are destroying the causes of your tor- ment—nationalities, front iers, differences of coinages.

Then will the mob exalt us and bear us up in their hands in a unanimous triumph of hopes and expecta- tions. Voting, which we have made the instrument which will set us on the throne of the world by teaching even the very smallest units of members of the human race to vote by means of meetings and agreements by groups, will then have served its purposes and will play its part then for the last time by a unanimity of desire to make close acquaintance with us before condemning us. To secure this we must have ev erybody vote without distinction of classes and qualifications, in order to establish an absolute majority, which cannot be got from the educated propertied classes.

In this way we shall create a blind, mighty force which will never be in a position to move in any direction without the guidance of our agents se t at its head by us as leaders of the mob. The people will submit to this regime because it will know that upon these leaders will depend it s earnings, gratifications and the receipt of all kinds of benefits. A scheme of government should co me ready made from one brain, because it will never be clinched firmly if it is allowed to be split into fractional parts in the minds of many. It is allowable, therefore, for us to have cognisance of the scheme of action but not to discuss it lest we disturb its artfulness, th e interdependence of its component parts, the practical force of the secret meaning of each clause. To discuss and make alterations in a labour of this kind by means of numerous votings is to impress upon it the stamp of all ratiocinations and misunderstandings which have fa iled to penetrate the depth and nexus of its plottings.

I need not explain to you the mechanism of the relation of these institutions to one another, because you are aware of all that; only take note of the fact that each of the above-named institutions corresponds to some important function of the State, and I would beg you to remark that the word \"important\" I apply not to the institution but to the function, consequently it is not the institutions which are important but their functions.

If we injure one part in the machinery of State, the State falls sick, like a human body, and will die. When we introduced into the State organism the poison of Liberal- ism its whole political complexion underwent a change. -States have been seized with a mo rtal illness—blood-poisoning. All that remains is to await the end of their death agony. Liberalism produced Constitutional States, which took the place of what was the only safeguard of the goyim, namely, Despotism; and a constitution, as you well know, is not hing else but a school of discords, misunderstandings, quarrels, disagr eements, fruitless party agitations, party whims—in a word, a school of everything that serves to destroy the personality of State activity. The tribune of the \"talkeries\" has, no less effectively than the Press, condemned the rulers to inactivity and impotence, and thereby rendered them useless and superfluous, for which reason indeed they have been in ma ny countries deposed. Then it was that the era of republics became possibl e of realisation; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government—by a president, taken from the mob, from the midst of our puppet creatures, our slaves. This was the foundation of the mine which we have laid under the goy people, I should rath er say, under the goy peoples. In the near future we shall establ ish the resp6nsibility of presidents. By that time we shall be in a position to disregard forms in carry- ing through matters for which our pe rsonal puppet will be responsible. What do we care if the ranks of those striving for power should be thinned, if there should arise a deadlock from the impossibility of finding presidents, a deadlock which will finally disorganize the coun- try? In order that our scheme may produc e this result we shall arrange elections in favour of such presidents as have in their past some dark, undiscovered stain, some \"Panama\" or other—then they will be trust- worthy agents for the accomplishment of our plans out of fear of revelations and from the natural desi re of everyone who has attained power, namely, the retention of privileges, advantages and honour connected with the office of presid ent. The chamber of deputies will provide cover for, will pr otect, will elect the president, but we shall take from it the right to propose new, or make changes in existing laws, for this right will be given by us to the responsible president, a puppet"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"294 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper in our hands. Naturally, the authority of the president will then become a target for every possible fo rm of attack, but we shall provide him with a means of self-defence in the right of an appeal to the people, for the decision of the people over the heads of their repre- sentatives, that is to say, an appeal to that same blind slave of ours— the majority of the mob. Independently of this we shall invest the president with the right of declaring a state of war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the whole army of the country must have it at his disposal, in case of need for the defence of the new republican constitution, the right to defend which will belong to him as the responsible representative of this constitution. It is easy to understand that in these conditions the key of the shrine will lie in our hands, and no one outside of ourselves will any longer direct the force of legislation. Besides this we shall, with the introduction of the new republican constitution, take from the Chamber the right of interpellation on government measures, on the pretext of preserving political secrecy, and, further, we shall by the new constitution reduce the number of representatives to a minimum, thereby proportionately reducing polit- ical passions and the passion for politics. If, however, they should, which is hardly to be expected, burst into flame, even in this mini- mum, we shall nullify them by a stirring appeal and a reference to the majority of the whole people. . . . Upon the president will depend the appointment of presidents and vice-presidents of the Cham- ber and the Senate. Instead of consta nt sessions of Par liaments we shall reduce their sittings to a few mont hs. Moreover, the president, as chief of the executive power, will have the right to summon and dissolve Parliament, and, in the la tter case, to prolong the time for the appointment of a ne w parliamentary assembly. But in order that the consequences of all these acts wh ich in substance are illegal, should not, prematurely for our plans, fa ll upon the responsibility established by us of the president, toe shall instigate ministers and other officials of the higher administration about the president to evade his disposi- tions by taking measures of their own, for doing which they will be made the scapegoats in his place. . . .

By such measures we shall obtain the power of destroying little by little, step by step, all that at the outset when we enter on our rights, we are compelled to introduce into the constitutions of States to pre- pare for the transition to an imperceptible abolition of every kind of constitution, and then the time is come to turn every form of govern- ment into our despotism. The recognition of our despot may also come before the destruction of the constitution; the moment for this recognition will come when the peoples, utterly wearied by the irregularities and incompetence— a matter which we shall arrange for—of their rulers, will clamour: \"Away with them and give us one king over all the earth who will unite us and annihilate the causes of discords—frontiers, nationalities, religions, State debts—who will give us peace and quiet, which we cannot find under our rulers and representatives.\" But you yourselves perfectly well know that to produce the possi- bility of the expression of such wishes by all the nations it is indis- pensable to trouble in all countrie s the people's relations with their governments so as to utterly exhaus t humanity with di ssension, hatred, struggle, envy and even by the use of torture, by starvation, BY THE INOCULATION OF DISEASES, by want, so that the GOYIM see no other issue than to take refuge in our complete sove reignty in money and in all else.

It is this which has served as the basis for our organisation of SE CRET MASONRY WHICH IS NOT KNOWN TO, AND AIMS WHICH ARE NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED BY, THESE GOY CATTLE, ATTRACTED BY US INTO THE \"SHOW ARMY OF MASONIC LODGES IN ORDER TO THROW DUST IN THE EYES OF THEIR FEL- LOWS. God has granted to us, His Chosen People, the gift of the dis- persion, and in this which appears in all eyes to be our weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now brought us to the threshold of sovereignty over all the world. There now remains not much more for us to build up upon the foundation we have laid. PROTOCOL NO . 12 The word \"freedom,\" which can be interpreted in various ways, is defined by us as follows:— Freedom is the right to do that which the law allows. This interpre- tation of the word will at the proper time be of service to us, because all freedom will thus be in our hands, since the laws will abolish or create only that which is desirable for us according to the aforesaid programme. We shall deal with the press in the following way: What is the part played by the press to-day? It serves to excite and inflame those passions which are needed for our purpose or else it serves selfish ends of parties. It is ofte n vapid, unjust, mendaci ous, and the majority of"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"298 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper the public have not the slightest idea what ends the press really serves. We shall saddle and bridle it with a tight curb: we shall do the same also with all productions of the printing press, for where would be the sense of getting rid of the attacks of the press if we remain targets for pamphlets and boob? The produce of publicity, which nowadays is a source of heavy expense owing to the necessity of censor- ing it, will be turned by us into a very lucrative source of income to our State: we shall lay on it a special stamp tax and require deposits of caution-money before permitting the establishment of any organ of the press or of printing offices; thes e will then have to guarantee our government against any kind of attack on the pan of the press. For any attempt to attack us, if such still be possible, we shall inflict fines without mercy. Such measures as stamp tax, deposit of caution-money and fines secured by these deposits, w ill bring in a huge income to the government. It is true that party or gans might not spare money for the sake of publicity, but these we shall shut up at the second attack upon us. No one shall with impunity lay a finger on the aureole of our government infallibility. The pretext for stopping any publication will be the alleged plea that it is agit ating the public mi nd without occasion or justification. I beg you to not e that among those making attacks upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will attack exclusively points that we have pre-determined to alter. Not a single announcement will reach the public without our con- trol. Even now this is already bei ng attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused from all parts of the world. These agencies will then be already entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them. If already now we have contrived to possess ourselves of the minds of the goy communities to such an extent that they all come near looking upon the events of the world through the coloured glasses of those spectacles we are setting astride their noses: if already now there is not a single State where there exist for us any barriers to admittance into what goy stupidity calls State secrets: what will our position be then, when we shall be acknowledged supreme lords of the world in the person of our king of all the world.... Let us turn again to the future of the printing press. Every one desirous of being a publisher, librarian, or printer, will be obliged to provide himself with the diploma instituted therefor, which, in case"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 299 of any fault, will be immediately impounded. W ith such measures the instrument of thought will become an educative means in the hands of our government, which will no longer allow the mass of the nation to be led astray in by-ways and fantasie s about the blessings of progress. Is there any one of us who does not kno w that these phantom blessings are the direct roads to foolish imagini ngs which give birth to anarchical relations of men among themselves and towards authority, because progress, or rather the idea of progress, has introduced the conception of every kind of emancipation, but ha s failed to establish its limits. . . . All the so-called liberals are anarchists, if not in fact, at any rate in thought. Every one of them is hunt ing after phantoms of freedom, and falling exclusively into license, that is, into the anarchy of pro- test for the sake of protest. . . . We turn to the periodical press. We shall impose on it, as on all printed matter, stamp taxes per shee t and deposits of caution-money, and books of less than 30 sheets will pay double. We shall reckon them as pamphlets in order, on the one hand, to reduce the number of maga- zines, which are the worst form of printed poison, and, on the other, in order that this measure may forc e writers into such lengthy produc- tions that they will be little read, espe cially as they will be costly. At the same time what we shall publish oursel ves to influence mental develop- ment in the direction laid down for our profit will be cheap and will be read voraciously. The tax will bring va pid literary ambitions within bounds and the liability to penalties wi ll make literary men dependent upon us. And if there should be any found who are desirous of writing against us, they will not find any person eager to print their produc- tions. Before accepting any production for publication in print the publisher or printer will have to apply to the authorities for permission to do so. Thus we shall know beforehand of all tricks preparing against us and shall nullify them by get ting ahead with explanations on the subject treated of. Literature and journalism are two of the most important educative forces, and therefore our government will become proprietor of the majority of the journals. This will neutralise the injurious influence of the privately owned press and will put us in possession of a tre- mendous influence upon the public mind. ... If we give permits for ten journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same proportion. This, however, must in nowise be suspected by the public."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"300 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper For which reason all journals publishe d by us will be of the most opposite, in appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating con- fidence in us and bringing over to us our quite unsuspicious opponents, who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless. In the front rank will stand organs of an official character. They will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence will be comparatively insignificant. In the second rank will be the semi -official organs, whose part it will be to attract the tepid and indifferent. In the third rank we shall set up our own, to all a ppearance, opposi- tion, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what looks like the very antipodes to us. Our real opponents at heart will accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their cards. All our newspapers will be of all possible complexions—aristo- cratic, republican, revolutionary, ev en anarchical—for so long, of course, as the constitution exists. . . . Like the Indian idol Vishnu they will have a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions as required. When a pulse quickens these hands will lead opini on in the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all pow er of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. Those fools who w ill think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable for us. In the vain belief that they are following the organ of their party they will in fact follow the flag which we hang out for them. In order to direct our newspaper m ilitia in this sense we must take especial and minute care in organisi ng this matter. Under the title of central department of the press we shall institute literary gatherings at which our agents will without a ttracting attention issue the orders and watchwords of the day. By disc ussing and controverting, but always superficially, without touching the e ssence of the matter, our organs will carry on a sham fight fusillade w ith the official newspapers solely for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more fully than could well be done from the outset in official announce- ments, whenever, of course, that is to our advantage. These attacks upon us will also se rve another purpose, namely, that our subjects will be convinced of the existence of full freedom of speech and so give our agents an occasion to affirm that all organs"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion . 301 which oppose us are empty babblers, si nce they are incapable of finding any substantial object ions to our orders. Methods of organisation like these, imperceptible to the public eye but absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed in bringing the attention and the confidence of the public to the side of our govern- ment. Thanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from time to time may be required, to excite or to tranquillise the public mind on political questions, to persuade or to confuse, printing now truth, now lies, facts or their cont radictions, according as they may be well or ill received, always very cautiously feeling our ground before stepping upon it. . . . We shall have a sure triumph over our opponents since they will not have at their disposition organs of the press in which they can give full and final expression to their views owing to the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. We shall not even need to refute them except very superficially. Trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press, in case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our semi- official organs. Even nowadays, already, to take only the French press, there are forms which reveal masonic solidar ity in acting on the watchword: all organs of the press are bound t ogether by professional secrecy; like the augurs of old, not one of their numbers will give away the secret of his sources of information unless it be resolved to make announcement to them. Not one journalist will venture to betray this secret, for not one of them is ever admitted to practise literature unless his whole past has some disgraceful sore or other. . . . These sores would be immediately revealed . So long as they remain the secret of a few the prestige of the journalist attracts the majority of the country—the mob follows after him with enthusiasm. Our calculations are especially extended to the provinces. It is in- dispensable for us to inflame th ere those hopes and impulses with which we could at any moment fa ll upon the capital, and we shall represent to the capitals that thes e expressions are the independent hopes and impulses of the provinces. Naturally, the source of them will be always one and the same—ours. What we need is that, until such time as we are in the plenitude of fower, the capitals should find themselves stifled by the provincial opinion of the nation, i.e., of a majority arranged by our agentur. What we need is that at the psycho-"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"302 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper logical moment the capitals should not be in a position to discuss an accomplished fact for the simple reason, if for no other, that it has been accepted by the public opinion of a majority in the provinces. When we are in the period of the new regime transitional to that of our assumption of full sovereignty we must not admit any reve- lations by the press of any form of public dishonesty; it is necessary that the new regime should be thought to have so perfectly contented everybody that even criminality has disappeared. , . . Cases of the manifestation of criminality shoul d remain known only to their vic- tims and to chance witnesses—no more.

Agents taken on to our press from among the goyim will at our order discuss an ything which it is inconvenient for us to issue directly in official documents, and we meanwhile, quietly amid the din of the discussion so ra ised, shall simply take and carry through such measures as we wish and then offer them to the public as an accomplished fact. No one will dare to demand the abrogation of a matter once settled, all the more so as it will be represented as an improvement. . . .

From all this you will see that in securing the opinion of the mob we are only facilitating the working of our machinery, and you may remark that it is not for actions but for words issued by us on this or that question that we seem to seek approval. We are con- stantly making public de claration that we are guided in all our under- takings by the hope, joined to the co nviction, that we are serving the commonweal.

We must therefore sweep away all other forms of belief. If this gives birth to the atheists whom we see to-day, it will not, being only a transitional st age, interfere with our views, but will serve as a warning for those generations which will hearken to our preaching of the religion of Moses, that, by its stable and thoroughly elaborated system, has brought all the peoples of the world into subjection to us.

The attainment of that well-being, even at the expense of sacrifices, is the dut y of any kind of government that acknowledges as justific ation for its existence not only its privileges but its obligations. The principal guarantee of stability of rule is to confirm the aureole of power, and this aureole is attained only by such a majestic inflexibility of might as shall carry on its face the emblems of inviolability from mystical causes—from the choice of God. Such was, until recent times, the Russian autocracy, the one and only serious foe we had, in the wo rld, without counting the Papacy. Bear in mind the example when Italy, drenched with blood, never touched a hair of the head of Sulla* who had poured forth that blood: Sulla enjoyed an apotheosis for his might in the eyes of the people, though they had been torn in pieces by him, but his intrepid return to Italy ringed him round with inviolability.

The class of people who most willingly enter into secret societies are those who live by their wits, careerists, and in general people, mostly light-minded, with whom we sh all have no difficulty in dealing and in using to wind up the mechanism of the machine devised by us. If this world grows agitated the meaning of that will be that we have had to stir it up in order to break up its too great solidarity. But if there should, arise in its mids t a plot, then at the head of that plot will be no other than one of our most trusted servants. It is natural that we and no other shoul d lead masonic activities, for we know whither we are leading, we know the final goal of every form of activity whereas the goyim have knowledge of nothing, not even of the immediate effect of action; they put before themselves, usu- ally, the momentary reckoning of the satisfaction of their self-opinion in the accomplishment of their thought without even remarking that the very conception never belonged to their initiative but to our insti- gation of their thought.... The goyim enter the lodges out of curiosity or in the hope by their means to get a nibble at the public pie, and some of them in order to obtain a hearing before the public for thei r impracticable and groundless fantasies: they thirst for the emotion of success and applause, of which we are remark ably generous. And the reason why we give them this success is to make use of the high conceit of them- selves to which it gives birth, for that insensibly disposes them to assimilate our suggestions without being on their guard against them in the fullness of their confidence that it is their own infallibility which is giving utterance to their own thoughts and that it is im- possible for them to borrow those of others. . . . You cannot imagine to what extent the wisest of the goyim can be brought to a state of unconscious naivete in the presence of this condition of high conceit of themselves, and at the same time how easy it is to take the heart out of them by the slightest ill- success, though it be nothing more than the stoppage of the applause they had, and to reduce them to a slavish submission for the sake of winning a renewal of success. . . ."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"308 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper By so much as ours disregard success if only they can carry through their plans, by so much the goyim are willing to sacrifice any plans only to have success. This psychology of theirs materially facilitates for us the task of setting them in the required direction. These tigers in appearance have the souls of sheep and the wind blows freely through their heads. We have set them on the hobby-horse of an idea about the absorption of individuality by the symbolic unit of collectivism. . . . They have never yet and they never will have the sense to reflect that this hobby-horse is a manifest violation of the most important law of nature, wh ich has established from the very creation of the world one unit unlike another and precisely for the purpose of instituting individuality. . . . If we have been able to bring them to such a pitch of stupid blindness is it not a proof, and an amazingly clear proof, of the degree to which the mind of the goyim is undeveloped in comparison with our mind? This it is, mainly, which guarantees our success. And how far-seeing were our learned elders in ancient times when they said that to attain a serious end it behoves not to stop at any means or to count the victims sacrifi ced for the sake of that end. . . . We have not counted the victims of the seed of the goy cattle, though we have sacrificed many of our own, but for that we have now already given them such a position on the earth as they could not even have dreamed of. The comparatively small numbers of the victims from the number of ours have preserved ou r nationality from destruction. Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves, to the founders of this affair.

Knowing this, even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. By such methods we have plucked out of the midst of masonry the very ro ot of protest against our disposi- tion. While preaching liberalism to the goyim we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission.

Even senators and the higher admi nistration accept our counsels. The purely brute mind of the goyim is in capable of use for analysis and observation, and still more for the foreseeing whither a certain manner of setting a question may tend. In this difference in capacity for thought between the goyim and ourselves may be clearly discerne d the seal of our position on the Chosen People and of our higher quality of humanness, in contra- distinction to the brute mind of the goyim. Their eyes are open, but see nothing before them and do not invent (unless, perhaps, material things). From this it is plain that nature herself has destined us to guide and rule the world.

For example: our judges will know that whenever they feel disposed to fpume themselves on foolish clemency they are violating the law of justice which is insti- tuted for the exemplary edification of men by penalties for lapses and not for display of the spiritual qualities of the judge. . . . Such qual- ities it is proper to show in private life, but not in a public square which is the educationary basis of human life. Our legal staff will serve not bey ond the age of 55, firstly because old men more obstinately hold to prejudiced opinions, and are less capable of submitting to new directions, and second because this will give us the possibility by this measure of securing elasticity in the changing of staff, which will thus the more easily bend under our pressure: he who wishes to keep hi s place will have to give blind obedience to deserve it. In general, our judges will be elected by us only from among those who thoroughly unde rstand that the part they have to play is to punish and appl y laws and not to dream about the manifestations of liberalism at the expense of the educationary scheme of the State, as the goyim in these days imagine it to be. . . . This method of shuffling the staff will se rve also to explode any collective solidarity of those in the same service and will bind all to the inter- ests of the government upon which their fate will depend. The young generation of judges will be traine d in certain views regarding the inadmissibility of any abuses that might disturb the established order of our subjects among themselves. In these days the judges of the goyim create indulgences to every kind of crime, not having a just understanding of their office, because the rulers of the present age in appointing judges to office take no care to inculcate in them a sense of duty and consciousness of the matter which is demanded of them. As a brute beast lets out its young in search of prey, so do the goyim gi ve their subjects places of profit without thinking to make clear to them for what purpose such place was created.

For the peoples of the world in regard to the secrets of our polity are ever through the ages only children under age, precisely as are also their governments.

It has the right of the strong that it may use it for the benefit of di recting humanity towards that order which is defined by nature, namely , submission. Everything in the world is in a state of submission, if not to man, then to circumstances or its own inner characte r, in all cases, to what is stronger.

The indispensable victims offered by hi m in consequence of their suit- ability will never reach the number of victims offered in the course of centuries by the mania of magni ficence, the emulation between the goy governments.

The ill-guided acquaintance of a large number of persons with questions of polity creates Utopian dreamers and bad subjects, as you can see for yourselves from the example of the universal education in this direction of the goyim. We mu st introduce into their education all those principles which have so brilliantly broken up their order.

We shall erase from the memory of men all facts of previous centuries which are undesirable to us, and leave only those which de pict all the errors of the govern- ment of the goyim. The study of pr actical life, of the obligations of order, of the relations of people one to another, of avoiding bad and selfish examples, which spread the infection of evil, and similar ques- tions of an educative nature, will stand in the forefront of the teaching programme, which will be drawn up on a separate plan for each call- ing or state of life, in no wise generalising the teaching. This treat- ment of the question has special importance. Each state of life must be traine d within strict limits corresponding to its destination and work in life.

You know yourselves in what all this has ended for the GOYIM who allowed this crying absurdity. In order that he who rules may be seated firmly in the hearts and minds of his subjects it is necessary for the time of his activity to instruct the whole nation in the schools and on the market places about his meaning and his acts a nd all his beneficent initiatives.

These theories will be raised by us to the stage of a dogma of faith as a transitional stage towards our faith. On the completion of this exposition of our programme of action in the present and the future I will read you the principles of these theories. In a word, knowing by the experience of many centuries that people live and are guided by ideas, that these ideas are imbibed by people only by the aid of education provided with equal success for all ages of growth, but of course by varying methods, we shall swallow up and confiscate to our own use the last scintilla of independence of thought, which we have for long past been directing towards subjects and ideas useful for us. The system of bridling thought is already at work in the so-called system of teaching by object lessons, the pur- pose of which is to turn the goyim into unthinking submissive brutes waiting for things to be presented before their eyes in order to form an idea of them. ...

They do not usually decline to undertake any defence whatever, they strive for an acquittal at all costs, cavilling over every petty crux of juris- prudence and thereby they demoralis e justice. For this reason we shall set this profession into narrow frames which will keep it inside this sphere of executive public serv ice. Advocates, equa lly with judges, will be deprived of the right of communication with litigants; they will receive business only from the court and will study it by notes of report and documents, defending their clients after they have been interrogated in court on facts that have appeared.

We shall set clerical- ism and clericals into such narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive propor tion to its former progress. When the time comes finally to destroy the papal court the finger of an invisible hand will point the nations towards this court. When, however, the nations fling themselv es upon it, we shall come forward in the guise of its defenders as if to save excessive bloodshed.

In our programme one-third of our subjects will keep the rest under observation from a sense of duty, on the principle of volunteer service to the State. It will then be no disgrace to be a spy and informer, but a merit: unfounded denunciations, however, will be cruelly punished that there may be no development of abuses of this right.

Any person not denouncing anything seen or heard concerning questions of polity will also be charged with and made responsible for concealment, if it be proved that he is guilty of this crime.

Among the number of those methods one of the most important is—agents for the restoration of order, so placed as to have the opportunity in their disint egrating activity of developing and displaying their evil inclinations—obs tinate self-conceit, irresponsible exercise of authority, and, first and foremost, venality."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 317 PROTOCOL NO. 18 When it becomes necessary for us to strengthen the strict measures of secret defence (the most fatal poi son for the prestige of authority) we shall arrange a simulation of di sorders or some manifestation of discontents finding expression through the co-operation of good speakers.

Therefore, with the observance of this decorum, his authority will be respected and guarded by the subjects themselves, it will receive an apotheosis in the admission that with it is bound up the well-being of every citizen of the State, for upon it will depend all order in the common life of the pack. . . ."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"318 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Overt defence of the king argues weakness in the organisation of his strength. Our ruler will always among the people be surrounded by a mob of apparently curious men and wo men, who will occupy the front ranks about him, to all appearance by chance, and will restrain the ranks of the rest out of respect as it will appear for good order. This will sow an example of restraint also in others. If a petitioner appears among the people trying to hand a petition and forcing his way through the ranks, the first ranks must receive the petition and before the eyes of the petitioner pass it to the ruler, so that all may know that what is handed in reaches its destination, that, consequently, there exists a control of the ruler himself. The aureole of power requires for its existence that the people may be able to say: \"If the king knew of this,\" or: \"the king will hear of it.\" With the establishment of official secret defence the mystical prestige of authority disappears: given a ce rtain audacity, and everyone counts himself master of it, the sedition-m onger is conscious of his strength, and when occasion serves watches for the moment to make an at- tempt upon authority. . . . For the goyim we have been preaching something else, but by that very fact we are enabled to see what measures of overt defence have brought them to. . . .

Public opinion will then confuse in its conception this category of crime with the disgrace attaching to every other and will brand it with the same contempt. We have done our best, and I hop e we have succeeded, to obtain that the goyim should not arrive at this means of contending with sedition. It was for this reason that through the press and in speeches, indirectly—in cleverly compiled schoolbooks on history, we have advertised the martyrdom alleged to have been accepted by sedition- mongers for the idea of the comm onweal.

Before entering upon it I will remind you that I have already spoken before by way of a hint when I said that the sum total of our actions is settled by the question of figures. When we come into our kingdom our autocratic government will avoid, from a principle of self-pre servation, sensibly burdening the masses of the people with taxes, reme mbering that it plays the part of father and protector. But as State organisation costs dear it is neces- sary nevertheless to obtain the funds required for it. It will, therefore, elaborate with particular precaution the question of equilibrium in this matter."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"320 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper Our rule, in which the king will enjoy the legal fiction that every- thing in his State belongs to him (which may easily be translated into fact), will be enabled to resort to the lawful confiscation of all sums of every kind for the regulation of their circulation in the State. From this follows that taxation will be st be covered by a progressive tax on property. In this manner the due s will be paid without straitening or ruining anybody in the form of a percentage of the amount of property. The rich must be aware that it is their duty to place a part of their superfluities at the disposal of the State since the State guar- antees them security of possession of the rest of their property and the right of honest gains, I say honest, for the control over property will do away with robbery on a legal basis. This social reform must come from above, for the time is ripe for it—it is indispensable as a pledge of peace. The tax upon the poor man is a seed of revolution and works to the detriment of the State which in hunting after the trifling is missing the big. Quite apart from this, a tax on capitalists diminishes the growth of wealth in private hands in which we have in these days concen- trated it as a counterpoise to th e government strength of the goyim— their State finances. A tax increasing in a percentage ratio to capital will give a much larger revenue than the present individual or property tax, which is useful to us now for the sole reas on that it excites trouble and dis- content among the goyim. The force upon which our king will rest consists in the equilibrium and the guarantee of peace, for the sake of which things it is indis- pensable that the capitalists should yield up a portion of their incomes for the sake of the secure working of the machinery of the State. State needs must be paid by thos e who will not feel the burden and have enough to take from.

He who reigns will not have any properties of his own once all in the State represents his patrimon y, or else the one would be in contradiction to the other; the fa ct of holding private means would destroy the right of property in the common possessions of all. Relatives of him who reigns, his he irs excepted, who will be main- tained by the resources of the State, must enter the ranks of servants of the State or must work to obtain the right of property; the privilege of royal blood must not serve for the spoiling of the treasury. Purchase, receipt of money or inhe ritance will be subject to the payment of a stamp progressive tax. Any transfer of property, whether money or other, without evidence of payment of this tax which will be strictly registered by names, will render the former holder liable to pay interest on the tax from the moment of transfer of these sums up to the discovery of his evasion of declaration of the transfer. Transfer documents must be presented weekly at the local treasury office with notifications of the na me, surname and permanent place of residence of the former and the new holder of the property. This transfer with register of names mu st begin from a de finite sum which exceeds the ordinary expenses of buying and selling of necessaries, and these will be subject to pa yment only by a stamp impost of a definite percentage of the unit. Just strike an estimate of how many times such taxes as these will cover the revenue of the goyim States. The State exchequer will have to maintain a definite complement of reserve sums, and all that is co llected above that complement must be returned into circulation. On these sums will be organised public works. The initiative in works of this kind, proceeding from State sources, will bind the working class firmly to the interests of the State and to those who reign. From these sa me sums also a part will be set aside as rewards of inventiveness and productiveness. On no account should so much as a single unit above the definite and freely estimated sums be retained in the State treasuries, for money exists to be ci rculated and any kind of stagnation of money acts ruinously on the running of the State machinery, for which it is the lubricant; a stagnation of the lubricant may stop the regular working of the mechanism."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"322 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE • William Cooper The substitution of interest-bearing paper for a part of the token of exchange has produced exactly th is stagnation. The consequences of this circumstance are already sufficiently noticeable. A court of account will also be instituted by us and in it the ruler will find at any moment a full accounting for State income and ex- penditure, with the exception of the current monthly account, not yet made up, and that of the prec eding month, whic h will not yet have been delivered. The one and only person who will have no interest in robbing the State is its owner, the ruler. This is why his personal control will remove the possibility of leakages of extravagances. The representative function of the ruler at receptions for the sake of etiquette, which absorbs so much invaluable time, will be abolished in order that the ruler may have t ime for control and consideration. His power will not then be split up into fractional parts among time- serving favourites who surround the throne for its pomp and splendour, and are interested only in their own and not in the common interests of the State. Economic crises have been produced by us for the goyim by no other means than the withdrawal of money from circulation. Huge capitals have stagnated, withdraw ing money from States, which were constantly obliged to apply to thos e same stagnant capitals for loans. These loans burdened the finances of the State with the payment of interest and made them the bond sl aves of these capitals. . . . The concentration of industry in the hands of capitalists out of the hands of small masters has drained away all the juices of the peoples and with them also of the States. . . .

We shall make the issue of money in accordance with the normal requirements of each subject, adding to the quantity with every birth and sub- tracting with every death. The accounts will be managed by each department (the French administrative division), each circle. In order that there may be no de lays in the paying out of money for State needs the sums and terms of such payments will be fixed by decree of the ruler; this will do away with the protection by a ministry of one institution to the detriment of others. The budgets of income and expenditure will be carried out side by side that they may not be obs cured by distance one to another. The reforms projected by us in the financial institutions and prin- ciples of the goyim will be closed by us in such forms as will alarm nobody. We shall point out the necessity of reforms in consequence of the disorderly darkness into which the goyim by their irregularities have plunged the finances. The firs t irregularity, as we shall point out, consists in their beginning with drawing up a single budget which year after year grows owing to the following cause: this budget is dragged out to half the year, then they demand a budget to put things right, and this they expend in thre e months, after which they ask for a supplementary budget, and all this ends with a liquidation budget. But, as the budget of the following year is drawn up in accordance with the sum of the total addition, th e annual departure from the normal reaches as much as 50 per cent, in a year, and so the annual budget is trebled in ten years. Thanks to such methods, allowed by the care- lessness of the goy States, their treasuries are empty. The period of loans supervenes, and that has sw allowed up remainders and brought all the goy States to bankruptcy. You understand perfectly that econo mic arrangements of this kind, which have been suggested to the goyim by us, cannot be carried on by us. Every kind of loan proves infirmity in the State and a want of understanding of the rights of the State. Loans hang like a sword of Damocles over the heads of rulers, who, instead of taking from their subjects by a temporary tax, come begging with outstretched palm of our bankers. Foreign loan s are leeches which there is no possibility of removing from the body of the State until they fall"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"324 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper off of themselves or the State flings them off. But the goy States do not tear them off; they go on in persisting in putting more on to them- selves so that they must inevitably perish, drained by voluntary blood- letting. What also indeed is, in substance, a loan, especially a foreign loan? A loan is—an issue of government bills of exchange containing a percentage obligation commensurate to the sum of the loan capital. If the loan bears a charge of 5 pe r cent., then in twenty years the State vainly pays away in interest a sum equal to the loan borrowed, in forty years it is paying a double sum, in sixty—treble, and all the while the debt remains an unpaid debt. From this calculation it is obvious that with any form of taxation per head the State is baling out the last coppers of the poor taxpayers in order to settle accounts with w ealthy foreigners, from whom it has borrowed money instead of collectin g these coppers for its own needs without the additional interest. So long as loans were internal th e goyim only shuffled their money from the pockets of the poor to those of the rich, but when we bought up the necessary person in order to transfer loans into the external sphere all the wealth of States fl owed into our cash-boxes and all the goyim began to pay us th e tribute of subjects. If the superficiality of goy kings on their thrones in regard to State affairs and the venality of ministers or the want of under- standing of financial ma tters on the part of other ruling persons have made their countries debtors to our treasuries to amounts quite im- possible to pay it has not been a ccomplished without on our part heavy expenditure of trouble and money. Stagnation of money will not be allowed by us and therefore there will be no State interest-bear ing paper, except a one per cent. series, so that there will be no payment of interest to leeches that suck all the strength out of the State. The right to issue interest-bearing paper will be given exclusively to industrial companies who will find no difficulty in paying interest out of profits, whereas the State does not make interest on borrowed money like these companies, for the State borrows to spend and not to use in operations. Industrial papers will be bought also by the government which from being as now a payer of tribute by loan operations will be trans- formed into a lender of money at a prof it. This measure will stop the"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Chapter 15 Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion • 325 stagnation of money, parasitic profits and idleness, all of which were useful for us among the goyim so long as they were independent but are not desirable under our rule. How clear is the undeveloped power of thought of the 'purely brute brains of the goyim, as expressed in the fact that they have been borrowing from us with payment of inte rest without ever thinking that all the same these very moneys plus an addition for payment of interest must be got by them fro m their own State pockets in order to settle up with us. What could have been simpler than to take the money they wanted from their own people? But it is a proof of the genius of our chosen mind that we have contrived to present the matter of loans to them in such a light that they have even seen in them an advantage for themselves. Our accounts, which we shall present when the time comes, in the light of centuries of experience ga ined by experiments made by us on the goy States, will be distinguish ed by clearness and definiteness and will show at a glance to all men the advantage of our innovations. They will put an end to those abuses to which we owe our mastery over the goyim, but which cannot be allowed in our kingdom. We shall so hedge about our system of accounting that neither the ruler nor the most insignificant public servant will be in a position to divert even the smallest sum fro m its destination without detection or to direct it in another direction except that which will be once fixed in a definite plan of action.

PROTOCOL NO. 21 To what I reported to you at the last meeting I shall now add a detailed explanation of internal loans. Of foreign loans I shall say nothing more, because they have fed us with the national moneys of the goyim, but for our State there will be no foreigners, that is, nothing external. We have taken advantage of the venality of administrators and the slackness of rulers to get our m oneys twice, thrice and more times over, by lending to the goy govern ments moneys which were not at all needed by the States. Could anyone do the like in regard to us? . . . Therefore, I shall only deal with the details of internal loans. States announce that such a loan is to be concluded and open subscriptions for their own bills of exchange, that is, for their interest- bearing paper. That they may be within the reach of all the price is determined at from a hundred to a thousand; and a discount is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day by artificial means the price of them goes up, the alleged reason being that everyone is rushing to buy them. In a few days the treasury safes are as they say over- flowing and there's more money than they can do with (why then take it?). The subscription, it is alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan; in this lies the whole stage effect—look you, they say, what confidence is s hown in the government's bills of exchange. But when the comedy is played out there emerges the fact that a debit and an exceedingly burdensom e debit has been created. For the payment of interest it be comes necessary to have recourse to new loans, which do not swallow up but only add to the capital debt.

I was born into a privileged life-style in North Devon, England, the third and last child and only son of a wealthy, land-owning family. I was privately educated and left school early, determined to join my father's business and not be encumbered with the authoritarian atmosphere of school. I did so by getting myself expelled. I was, I believe, nearly sixteen. At once I began to work as a livestock broker as ray father and his family did and still does. I also farmed. I then branched into other goods, buying for customers using ray contacts to supply items at a lower cost and better quality items at the same cost than normal retail suppliers. I was very successful. My business continued to expand. Management was highly vertically structured, and diversification was as lateral as I could possibly make it. It continued to thrive. I developed a sophisticated tax-shelter system which was lawfully capable of removing taxation liability from the majority of my own and my colleagues' incomes. At age 20, in my twenty-first year, numerous old documents - family heirlooms from my mother's side of the family - were given to me as its last remaining male heir. (Page 1 of 26)"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 The Story of Jonathan May • 335 Among these old documents was an Indenture issued to an ancestor of mine, settling upon him \"and his heir and assigns in perpetuity for the duration of the term hereof\" the responsibility and authority of Trustee for certain property, goods, chattels, etc. As far as I can recall, the document was dated \"In this Year of Our Lord one Thousand, Six Hundred and Forty Seven\". The document - a parchment with the Royal Seal of England still at tached - constituted a Trust indenturing my ancestor, et. al. for a 999-year terra as trustee for the property named. The parchment was signed by \"Charles Stuart Rex Of England, France, and Ireland King\" - Charles I. Knowing nothing about such matters, I consulted lawyers . They determined the document was genuine, that a trust had been established by the British King Charles I and that its original trustee had been my ancestor, and that - as a matter of law - it could not be broken, the British monatch then - and still - being the Supreme Head of the judic iary in the United Kingdom. Also as a matter of law, the trust was an operative entity, under the provisions of which I, as the remaining male heir, was the responsible trustee. However, it had clearly been inoperative for as long as anyone could remember. Shares certified from \"The Dheli & Punjab Railway\" and other such antiquated relics - seemingly unredeemed still - were with the trust charter. Successive charters endorsed by successive British monarchs were with the original one as well. It was determined that sub-trusts - subsidiaries - should be formed at once, under the grandfathering precepts of the original 17th-century charter. Out of the air, I decided that 4000 such subsidiaries would be formed as (Telling Time.

Between the months of September 19, 1969 and February 15, 1970, these 4000 charters were printed and recorded in a register. These were numbered, prefixed by \"No. SSR/647/\". The first was chosen to be the common trustee entity for the remaining 3,999. None could be recorded in any one country. Doing so would have given the country of registration some prior-claim taxation ability. For this reason, the Register of the 4000 entities was kept in the constant custody of myself as the recorded sole-signator of record of the original trust which we named \"The International Equity Trust\". We decided to call the group of sub-trusts \"The Sovereign Charter Trust Group\". This main group was then subdivided into the Sodalitas Trust Group - comprised of the administrative, in-house members whose activities were to be coordinated by and through a board of directors k nown as The Trustee's Directorate Body. The remaining trusts were to have been sold/leased as tax-shelters to sundry third parties for the fee of 20% of the total tax liability saved by the client using the trust for this purpose, ie. without one of our trusts - a tax liability of $100,000, but with one of our trusts - at a cost to the client of $20,000 - a nil tax liability. In 1969, lawyers advised us that the only problem we faced was the taxation authorities' propensity to arbitrarily state that our trusts were a non-entity but that they would be protected from taxation anywhere worldwide by legislation once proof positive was available that they had been alive as artificial persons for twelve years.

Accordingly, I determined that I should continue my business enterprises for another twelve years and then simply sell or lease out the 3,999 trusts at either a flat fee or by the 20%-of-taxes-saved formula - and use the proceeds, in part, to re-determine the what, where, why, and when concerning the assets of the original trust. During the years that followed, I became more and more diversified and made sound commercial contacts all over the globe. Increasingly, my fees and commissions were being paid to me in differing currencies. This brought my atten tion to their differing interest rates and who, in fact, it is who determines which currencies are loaned at which rates. I discovered that a minute cartel controlled all banking policies worldwide, and that the provision or non-provision of \"money\" was all-controlling. As my reputation as a finder of the unusual at a fair price grew, I with my colleagues began to realize that there was considerable resistance throughout the conve ntional financial markets to \"entrepreneurs\". Highly determined but very independently-minded individuals were not at all welcome in \"normal\" banking circles. There was a very real need in the independent business communities throughout the world for alternative credit facilities to properly and fairly provide for entrepreneurial needs - a window in the market for them between new venture capital and died-in-the-wool conventional business capital.

We did find that there were never enough investors to be found. Otherwise, everyone seemed content. Like many arrogant and foolish young men before me, I tended to advertise my financial success. I grew headstrong. The local small town police force began to watch me and became a significant nuisance, stopping me for tires, speeding, etc., etc. I started a butcher business and again made a significant success of it, also in my hometown area. My success meant the loss of trade by my competition. My premises were burgled successively, and soon insurers would not insure me. I provided my own deterrent. I rigged a \"loaded shotgun\" sign outside of my premises and inside the coldstore placed a very lifelike loaded shotgun and trip alarm system for anyone thinking of again stealing my property as uninsured thousands had already been stolen. The local police arrested me for setting a man-trap with intent to endanger life. My intent, quite obviously, was to protect my property, so I was very properly acquitted of this foolish charge against me.

I began to be a minor celebrity in my little country town, and the local police were thoroughly incensed that the charges against me had been dropped. I had become something of a target. My \"high profile\" was not working for me. By this time, because of my motoring offenses and the publicity resulting from the trial and the mountain lion, my family all but disowned me. I made it my business to establish exactly who it was in the local police force who was instigating my problems. It was no lesser man than Inspector Goldsworthy. I hired people to watch his activities and it came out that he was involved with drug importing. The information supplied to me was that Goldsworthy had an aged mother in Plymouth, England whom he used as an excuse to make frequent trips there from North Devon, but in fact he was met there by individuals who were delivering illegal drugs to him. There was no way of establishing for certain if such was the case. The people I had been paying to follow him were not professionals. I felt it was time to hand the matter over into professional hands though, and I did so. Almost at once this particular inspector left the North Devon area. Word came back to me from different sources, probably the result of one of the two people I had employed to follow Goldsworthy talking carelessly, that Goldsworthy's subor dinates on the local police force were going to get even. The harassment grew to overwhelming proportions. For example, a hunting trip with authorized shotguns locked in my car under a blanket in the backseat became \"having a loaded shotgun in a public p lace\". Was one of my guns left loaded?

He sold me a dinghy and gave me a pair of boots. Both were stolen property and I was convicted of stealing and receiving them respectively. Fines were imposed. I realized finally that I had no prospect of leading a civilized life in my birthplace, so I left the U.K. and came to the U.S. to try to establish a new, unsullied life.

Geological surveys confirmed that these properties and the acreage adjoining had once been a significantly large lake fed by numerous streams from the Rocky Mountains.

Between 1982-3 and 1985-6 a considerable volume of face-value long-term maturity paper - private placement \"Prime Capital Notes\" was issued by the International Equity Trust for and on behalf of the seven trusts which owned the aforesaid gold and silver deposits. An ultra-conservative system of checks and balances was instituted by the Directorate Members of The International Equity Trust under the chairmanship and C.E.O. authority of the undersigned. Further applying the Equal Rights Doctrine of the United States to our private placement policy, I and my colleagues determined that in order to properly reflect the value of the gold and silver we had acquired it was necessary to establish a minimum possible value and use it as our represented maximum benchmark. This way, there could never be any question of misrepresentation instituted against us. In order to further insulate ourselves from any such charge, we determined that our \"paper\" was to present itself only upon a private placement basis throughout its \"life\" in the secondary markets.

This report concerns those assets' ability to properly reinstate the power and authority of Congress to govern without deference to those to whom it presently owes the National Debt and its life. On June 18, 1986, at the invitation of Attorney Ms. Wendy Alison Nora (an ex-Recorder who had been forced to resign from her position in the State of Wisconsin according to her subsequent disclosure to me) for and on behalf of \"not less than 40\" of the Sovereign Charter Trust Group's trusts - including the seven who own the nine square miles of gold and silver reserves and the 517,000 acres - The International Equity Trust purchased The Lac Qui Parle (Telling Time, Page 13 of 26)"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 The Story of Jonathan May • 347 Bancorporation, Inc. Said entity was and is authorized under Section 225.4 et. seq. of 12 CFR to \"act as a bank - buy and sell securities - underwrite insurance - municipal bonds and commercial paper,\" etc. This Holding Company owned and owns a financial entity named The State Bank of Boyd. Technically, The State Bank of Boyd (Minnesota) was declared closed as a bank by The Federal Reserve System in 1984. On March 31, 1986, The Minnesota State Supreme Court ruled that The State Bank of Boyd was not in liquidation nor in bankruptcy, but rather that its assets and liabilities only had been sold to the Bank of Madison - which later changed its name to The Lac Qui Parle Bank. (Note: NOT to be confused with The Lac Qui Parle Bancorporation, Inc.) Highly unconventionally but not unlawfully, as soon as we purchased The Lac Qui Parle Bancorporation, Inc.

A part of the acquisition contract whereby The International Equity Trust purchased the Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary The State Bank of Boyd was that, under the aforesaid provisions of 12 CFR Section 225.4 et. seq. , the Holding Company at once and thereby extended a $1,200,000,000 line of credit to the subsidiary under the strict understanding that said subsidiary was under the direct supervision of its parent entity The Lac Qui Parle Bancorporation, Inc. by and through its owners' Trustee, The International Equity Trust.

The State Bank of Boyd WAS closed down as a bank. It was not a non-viable corporate entity. It was not \"defunct\". It did not have a banking charter despite the fact that Attorney Nora confirmed to The Minnesota State Commissioner of Commerce that she took the legal position that \"it was in our possession constructively as a matter of law\". I took the position that, since the purpose of The Sovereign Charter Trust Group's acquisition of The Lac Qui Parle Bancorporation was primarily to outwit and outmaneuver the private owners of the Federal Reserve System and to provide an alternative credit system for the peoples and governments of the world - OUTSIDE of their manipulative controlled climate, we would NOT presume to overtly contravene the Minnesota State Banking authorities but rather, use the State Bank of Boyd in its ONLY corporate status as the SERVICE AGENT for The Lac Qui Parle Bancorporation, Inc., which was itself authorized by legislation to \"Act as a Bank\". The alternative credit facility which was presented to the Directorate Body of The International Equity Trust by our \"think-tank\" was, in ray estimation, nothing short of brilliant. After some deliberation, we decided to refer to our new, copyrighted system as \"The Reconomy System\". The Reconomy System is comprised of a series of individual self-help, socio-economic programs. As far as my memory serves me, a total of 170 different programs were (Telling Time, Page 15 of 26)"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 The Story of Jonathan May • 349 developed. The Reconomy Program restricts itself to two separate functions. One is the provision of interest-exempt credit facilities for private business users. The other is the provision of limited non-repayable grant facilities for what we chose to regard as \"Critical Need\" areas of society, eg. the homeless, drug and alcohol abuse victims, low-income students, and schools and universities which receive no Federal funds. These were and are national programs. During the late summer of 1985, The International Equity Trust was approached by a few of the debtor nations. They were complaining bitterly that the owners of the banks, particularly in the U.S., to which their countries were indebted, through the International Monetary Fund were calling for revisions and amendments to those nations' constitutions, the better to accommodate the corporate associates of those bank-owners in those corporations' designs to establish operations within the nations concerned. For those of you who are not aware, it is generally agreed within informed circles that the Presidency of James Earl Carter was orchestrated and primarily paid-for in campaign funds by various \"inner circle\" members of the Trilateral Commission. After the effective power and authority of The Federal Reserve System was shifted from a Washington, DC Board of Directors to the so-called \"independent\" shareholders of the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks - the voting shareholders of which in controll ing proportion are all \"coincidentally\" members of The Trilateral Commission - Jimmy Carter endorsed Paul Volker's \"Fractional Reserve Lending\" policy.

Fractional reserve lending, an exclusive ability of only Federal Reserve member institutions, is wholly and solely responsible for the fact that the nation's money supply in circulation is in fact comprised of over 97% credit for which nowhere on earth has there ever existed the printed currency equivalent. It was fractional reserve lending which was swiftly instituted immediately before high-ranking U.S. government officials persuaded the Nigerian Prime Minister to increase the price of Nigerian Crude Oil which he did, immediately prior to losing his life in a coup which was orchestrated by U.S. covert para-military personnel trained in Belize (then British Honduras). The Nigerian Prime Minister's life lasted \"coincidentally\" until the U.S officials had flown on to Kuwait and persuaded its oil producers to sell their oil at the inflated price of $30 per barrel. Why were these astute U.S. emissaries prepared to purchase the Arabs' oil at this hugely inflated price? The answer is both awesome and terrifying. U.S. government officials were prepared and authorized to agree to purchase the oil from the Persian Gulf states and the United Arab Emirates upon two seemingly innocuous conditions. The first condition was that O.P.E.C. - which was to have so much anti-Arab propaganda spewed up against it later - was to become a reality and insist that all oil sales worldwide were in the future to be dollar-denominated. The second and more sinister condition foisted upon the unsuspecting Arabs was the the U.S. oil companies purchasing the crude would (Telling Time, Page 17 Of 26)"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Chapter 16 The Story of Jonathan May • 351 not remit the sales proceeds back to the Middle East. Rather, the Arabs were invited as a prerequisite of sale at the inflated price to purchase long-term, 20 and 30-year Certificates of Deposit locked into their depositor banks. (Note: Readers are strongly invited to investigate, as did investigators within our Group, the \"coincidental\" relationships between the owner-controllers of the purchasing oil companies and the owner-controllers of the banks from which the Arabs \"chose\" to purchase their 20 and 30-year C.D.'s) ■ In simplest terms, what IS this \"fractional reserve lending\"? As evidenced by the fact that the money in circulation cannot be matched with currency in existence save in a negative ratio of about 66.6 to 1, it is fraud. Can YOU lend anyone $1 if 66. 6c of it has never been coined? The answer is \"yes\" if you are a member of The Federal Reserve System and not a humble licensee. In order to evaluate the extent of the fraud of fractional reserve lending as a matter of law, it is time to examine the corruption practiced against \"We the People\" of the U.S. as a result of its operation. Let us look at a tiny example of the O.P.E.C./U.S. Prime Bank scenario: An oil company issues a check for $lMillion to an Arab seller's stateside agent. The figures are crossed out of the oil company's account at, say, Chase Manhattan and inserted into a 30-year Certificate of Deposit in the Arab's name on the computer. The Arab has been paid. Who then owns Standard Oil? Who then owns Chase Manhattan? (Telling Time. Page 18 of 26)"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"352 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper What happens next? The crude is refined. The costs and profits are passed on to the U.S. public. \"That dirty Arab Cartel\" is blamed. But at $2 per gallon it is the oil company's account which receives the revenue. Meanwhile, what is happening to that Arab's account? It shows $lMillion. In fact the bank in our example, Chase Manhattan, has deposited that $lMillion - a piece of paper with $lMillion written on it - to The Federal Reserve Clearing System which \"pursuant to Fractional Reserve Lending Policy\" authorizes Chase Manhattan to loan at \"x60\" SIXTY MILLION to Mexico, Brazil, the U.S. Congress - whomever it pleases - promulgating the overwhelming falsehood that there is too much currency in the market and not enough borrowers. Concurrently, the U.S. Congress purportedly owes approximately $65Million per week for the next 2000 years providing that as of now not one further dime is ever spent and there is a 2000-year moratorium on all interest charges to Congress. Its second is the United Arab Emirates being paid about 7% per $lMillion in oil revenue. And those trusted pillars of society The Federal Reserve Members - for every $lMillion recorded due in about 25 years to the Arab - has the burden of paying that Arab about $70,000 per year and is only making from the White House a STAGGERING $6Million per year and REQUIRING at the same time $60Million per year as repayment because of Trilateral originated policy issued by Congress.

We unconditionally covenanted to Congress an equity parti cipation of a minimum of $750,000,000 per month, to each State an anticipated $40,000,000, a certain $35,000,000 per month, and to the Body Politic \"We the People\" upon a state by state basis about $150,000,000 per month.

Furthermore, a basis should be provided for the resolution of conflicts (ine vitably accompanying the problematique-type situations) through cooperation rather than confrontation. These factors have provided the motivation for initiation of the Strategy for Survival project which calls for the construction of a regionalized and adaptive model of the total world system with tht following specific objectives: (1) TO ENABLE THE IMPLEMENTA TION OF SCENARIOS FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD SYSTEM which represent visions of the world future stemming from different cultures and value systems and reflecting hopes and fears in different regions of the world. (ii) To develop a planning and options-assessment tool for long-range issues, and thereby TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION by cooperation rather than confrontation. 2. Basic Structure of the Model The basic characteristics of the model are: (i) THE WORLD SYSTEM IS REPRESENTED in terms of interacting regions with provisions made to investigate any individual country or subregion in the context of regional and global development. Presently the world system is represented BY TEN REGIONS: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, EASTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, REST OF DEVELOPED WORLD, LATIN AMERICA, MIDDLE EAST, REST OF AFRICA, SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIA, AND CHINA. (ii) In order to be able to deal with the complex of fact ors involved in problematique in a way which is sound, credible and syst ematic, a hierarchical structure has bee adopted for the model in which each level in the hierarchy represents the evolution of the world system within a context defined by a given set of laws and principles. Specifically, the levels involved are: GEO-PHYSICAL, ECOLOGICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL (MAN-MADE ENERGY AND MASS TRANSFERS), ECONOMIC, INSTITUTIONAL, SOCIO- POLITICAL, VALUE-CULTURAL AND HUMAN-BIOLOGICAL. Such and approach enables an optimal use of confirmed scientific knowledge and available data, (iii) An adequate view of the conditions in which the problematique is emerging and under which the solutions must be found require the recognition of the purposive aspects of the human community and adaptiveness of human beings. The model of the world system will have, therefore, two parts: (1) the so-called causal part, representing dynamical processes which follow histoical patterns of development and (2) the so-called goal-seeking part which represents purposive changes under new conditions. The goal-seeking part in turn includes two"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 451 levels: the decision-making or actions level and the norms level; the former represents the purposive response of the system while the latter represents the values and norms which constrain and condition such a response. 3. Progress in the Model Construction The construction of the model as described in Sec. 2 and with the objectives as specified in Sec. 1 is certainly a rather co mplex task and the research is organized to proceed in parallel in several directions. The overall assessment of the model status is the following: The model has been developed up to the stage where it can be used for policy analysis related to a number of critical issues, such as: energy resources utilization and technology assessment; food demand and production; population growth and the affect of timing of birth control programs ; reduction of inequities in regional economic developments; depletion dynamics of certain resources, particularly oil reserves; phosphorus use as fertilizer; regional un employment; constraints on growth due to labor, energy or expo rt limitation, etc. Specific developments which enable use of the model as described above include the following: 1. A COMPUTER MODEL OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED BY AN EXTENSIVE SET OF DATA. The model has two levels - macro and micro. On the MACRO LEVEL the model of each region INCLUDES THE GROSS REGIONAL PRODUCT, TOTAL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, CAPITAL AND LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF FINAL DEMAND SUCH AS PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, AND TOTAL INVESTMENT. ON THE MICRO LEVEL EIGHT PRODUCTION SECTORS ARE RECOGNIZED: AGRICULTURE MANUFACTURING, FOOD PROCESSING, ENERGY, MINING, SERVICES, BANKING AND TRADE, AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. The input-output framewo rk is used for the intermediate dema n d s . A FULL SCALE MICRO TRADE MATRIX ALSO HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. 2. A WORLD POPULATION MODEL HA S BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN TERMS OF THE SAME REGIONS AS THE ECONOMIC MODEL. The model has been validited by the data available. In each re gion the population structur e is represented in terms of four age groups with appropriate delays which make possible assessment of population momentum and assessment of the effectiveness of implementation of various population control measures. 3. AN ENERGY MODEL HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED which gives for each region the consumption and production of en ergy and interregional exchange of energy resources as a function of economic factors. Energy is treated both in composite terms and in reference to individual energy sour ces, namely solid fuel, liquid fuel, nuclear, gas and hydro. 4. A FOOD PRODUCTION AND ARABLE LAND USE MODEL HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED which allows the assessment of a number of food related issues including: the need and availability of phosphorus required for intensive agriculture, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF TIMING AND MAGNITUDES OF NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS DROUGHT, CROP FAILURE DUE TO DISEASE, ETC."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"452 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper 5. A MAJOR CONCERN IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPUTER MODEL is its proper utilization so as to avoid dependence on the deterministic aspects of model operation. In order to avoid this an interactive method of computer simulation analysis has been developed. THE METHOD REPRESENTS A SYMBIOSIS OF MAN AND COMPUTER IN WHICH THE COMPUTER PROVIDES THE LOGICAL AND NUME RICAL CAPABILITY WHILE MAN PROVIDES THE VALU ES, INTUITION AND EXPERIENCE. The method utilizes an option specification and selection prog ram which enables the policy analyst or decision-maker to evaluate alternative options on various levels of the decision process, i.e., with respect to goals, strategies, tac tical and implementational factors. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE NORM CHANGING PROCESSES. 4. Progress in Application THE MODEL HAS BEEN USED both for th e assessment of alternative scenarios for future regional and global developments (under different regional conditions) as well as in the interactive mode selection of policy options (specifically for the energy crises issues in developed regions). OUR EFFORTS IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WILL BE CONCENTRATED ON FURTHER USE OF THE ALREADY DEVELOPED MODEL. THE PLANS INCLUDE EMPHASIS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE DIRECTIONS: (i) Assessment in the changes over time of the span of options available to solve some major crisis problems. (ii) IMPLEMENTATION of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network for the purpose of joint assessment of the long term global future by teams from the various regions. (iii) Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order TO ASSESS with the model EXISTING OBSTACLES AND THE MEANS WHEREBY THE VISION MIGHT BECOME REALITY."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 453 'KINGDOMS' : CLUB OF ROME'S TEN GLOBAL GROUPS GROUP 1: North America Canada United States of America GROUP 2: Western Europe Andorra Luxembourg Austria Malta Belgium Monaco Denmark Netherlands Federal Republic of Germany Norway Finland Portugal France San Marino Great Britain Spain Greece Sweden Iceland Switzerland Ireland Turkey Italy Yugoslavia Liechtenstein GROUP 3: Japan GROUP 4: Rest of the Developed Market Economies Australia Oceania Israel South Africa New Zealand Tasmania GROUP 5: Eastern Europe Albania Hungary Bulgaria Poland Czechoslovakia Rumania German Democratic Republic Soviet Union"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"454 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper GROUP 6: Latin America Argentina Guyana Barbados Haiti Bolivia Honduras Brazil Jamaica British Honduras Mexico Chile Nicaragua Colombia Panama Costa Rica Paraguay Cuba Peru Dominican Republic Surinam Ecuador Trinidad and Tobago El Salvador Uruguay French Guiana Venezuela Guatemala GROUP 7: North Africa and the Middle East Adu Dhabi Lebanon Aden Libya Algeria Masqat-Oman Bahrain Morocco Cyprus Qatar Dubai Saudi-Arabia Egypt Syria Iran Trucial Oman Iraq Tunisia Jordan Yemen Kuwait GROUP 8: Main Africa Angola Ghana Burundi Guinea Cabinda Ivory Coast Cameroon Kenya Central African Republic Liberia Chad Malagasy Republic Dahomey Malawi Ethiopia Mali French Somali Coast Mauritania Gabon Mauritius Gambia Mozambique"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 455 Niger South West Africa Nigeria Spanish Guinea Portuguese Guinea Spanish Sahara Republic of Congo Sudan Reunion Tanzania Rhodesia Togo Rwanda Uganda Senegal Upper Volta Sierra Leone Zaire Somalia Zambia South Africa GROUP 9: South and Southeast Asia Afghanistan Malaysia Bangladesh Nepal Burma Pakistan Cambodia Philippines Ceylon South  Korea  India South Vietnam  Indonesia Taiwan L AOS Thailand GROUP 10: Centrally Planned Asia Mongolia North Vietnam North Korea People's Republic of China"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"456 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper "},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 457 "},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"458 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper "},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 459 "},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"460 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper "},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 461 "},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"462 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper "},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 463 1 -Rosen 1 -Liaison 1 - Nasca Date: November 29,1963 To: Director Bureau of Intelligence and Research Department of State From: John Edgar Hoover, Director Subject: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F.

This kind of program offers several advantages lacking in the social welfare model. First, it is unlikely to phase itself out, regardless of the predictable \"surprises\" science has in store for us: the universe is too big. In the event some individual project unexpectedly succeeds there would be no dearth of sub- stitute problems. For example, if colonization of the moon proceeds on schedule, it could then become \"neces- sary\" to establish a beachhead on Mars or Jupiter, and so on. Second, it need be no more dependent on the general supply-demand economy than its military prototype. Third, it lends itself extraordinarily well to arbitrary control. Space research can be viewed as the nearest modern equivalent yet devised to the pyramid-building, and similar ritualistic enterprises, of ancient societies. It is true that the scientific value of the space program, even of what has already been accomplished, is substantial on its own terms. But current programs are absurdly and obviously disproportionate, in the relationship of the knowledge sought to the expenditures committed. All but a small fraction of the space budget, measured by the standards of comparable scientific objectives, must be charged de facto to the military economy. Future space research, projected as a war surrogate, would further reduce the \"scientific\" rationale of its budget to a minuscule percentage indeed. As a purely economic"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"466 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR 63 substitute for war, therefore, extension of the space pro- gram warrants serious consideration. In Section 3 we pointed ou t that certain disarmament models, which we called c onservative, postulated ex- tremely expensive and elaborate inspection systems. Would it be possible to extend and institutionalize such systems to the point where they might serve as economic surrogates for war spending? The organization of fail- safe inspection machinery could well be ritualized in a manner similar to that of established military processes. \"Inspection teams\" might be very like armies, and their technical equipment might be very like weapons. In- flating the inspection budget to military scale presents no difficulty. The appeal of this kind of scheme lies in the comparative ease of transition between two parallel systems. The \"elaborate inspection\" surrogate is fundamentally fallacious, however. Although it might be economically useful, as well as politically necessary, during the disarm- ament transition, it would fail as a substitute for the economic function of war for one simple reason. Peace- keeping inspection is part of a war system, not of a peace system. It implies the possibility of weapons main- tenance or manufacture, which could not exist in a world at peace as here defined. Massive inspection also implies sanctions, and thus war-readiness. The same fallacy is more obvious in plans to create a patently useless \"defense conversion\" apparatus. The long-discredited proposal to build \"total\" civil defense"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"APPENDIX E New World Order • 467 66 THE REPORT obvious destabilizing effect of any global social welfare surrogate on politically necessary class relationships would create an entirely new set of transition problems at least equal in magnitude. Credibility, in fact, lies at the heart of the problem of developing a political substitu te for war. This is where the space-race proposals, in many ways so well suited as economic substitutes for war, fall short. The most ambi- tious and unrealistic space project cannot of itself gen- erate a believable external menace. It has been hotly argued 6 that such a menace would offer the 'last, best hope of peace,\" etc., by uniting mankind against the danger of destruction by \"creatures\" from other planets or from outer space. Experiments have been proposed to test the credibility of an out-of-our-world invasion threat; it is possible that a few of the more difficult-to-explain \"flying saucer\" incidents of recent years were in fact early experiments of this kind. If so, they could hardly have been judged encouraging. We anticipate no diffi- culties in making a \"need\" for a giant super space pro- gram credible for economic purposes, even were there not ample precedent; extending it, for political purposes, to include features unfortunately associated with science fiction would obviously be a more dubious undertaking. Nevertheless, an effective political substitute for war would require \"alternate enemies,\" some of which might seem equally farfetched in the context of the current war system. It may be, for instance, that gross pollution of the environment can even tually replace the possibility of mass destruction by nuclear weapons as the principal"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"468 • BEHOLD A PALE HORSE William Cooper SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR 67 apparent threat to the survival of the species. Poisoning of the air, and of the principal sources of food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a threat that can be dealt with only through social organ- ization and political power. But from present indications it will be a generation to a ge neration and a half before environmental pollution, however severe, will be suffi- ciently menacing, on a global scale, to offer a possible basis for a solution. It is true that the rate of pollution could be increased selectively for this purpose; in fact, the mere modifying of existing programs for the de terrence of pollution could speed up the process enough to make the threat credible much sooner. But the pollution problem has been so widely publicized in recent years that it seems highly improbable that a program of deliberate environmental poisoning could be implemented in a politically accept- able manner. However unlikely some of the possible alternate en- emies we have mentioned may seem, we must emphasize that one must be found, of credible quality and magni- tude, if a transition to peace is ever to come about with- out social disintegration. It is more probable, in our judgment, that such a threat will have to be invented, rather than developed from unknown conditions. For this reason, we believe further speculation about its puta- tive nature ill-advised in this context.

In the first there is on the part of the United States no engagement or promis e, while in the other Japan volun- tarily announces that Japan will hersel f engage not to violate the political or territorial integrity of her neighbor , and to observe the principle of the open door and equal opportunity, asking at the same time other nations to respect these principles. Therefore, gentlemen, you will mark the wide difference and agree with me, I am sure, that the use of the term is somewhat loose and misleading. I ask you to note this with no suggestion that I can or any one else does question the policy or attitude of your country, which we well know will always deal fairly and honor ably with other nations. As you must have noticed, I have pe rsistently struck one note every time I have spoken. It has been the note of warning against German in- trigue in America and in Japan—intri gue which has extended over a period of more than ten years. I am not goi ng to weary you with a repetition of this squalid story of plots, conceived an d fostered by the agents of Germany, but I solemnly repeat the warning here in this most distinguished gathering, so thoroughly representative of the high est ideals of Am erican journalism. In my speeches at various places I have endeavored to speak frankly on all points at issue or of interest at this time. There are, of course, some things which can not be openly disc ussed, because of a wise embargo upon unwise disclosures, but I am confiden t that from this time forward we will be able to effectively c ooperate in all matters tending to secure a victory in this struggle which means so much for all of us, and that throughout all the years to come, differences of opinion or difficulties arising between our two countries will be settled, as all su ch questions and difficulties can be settled, between close friends and partners. I thank you, sir, for your hospitalit y and for your courtesy.
